by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 14:06 est , 19 october 2012 a solo cyclist was the first victim of the @entity3 gun massacre – and not the @entity5 al - hilli family			2
the hugely significant development throws the focus of the entire investigation back on to 45 - year - old @entity9 , a @entity10 who was hit by up to seven bullets in the attack in eastern @entity10			1
mr @entity9 , who worked in the nuclear industry , died in an isolated wooden lay by near @entity15 on september 5			1
new developments : investigators now believe @entity10 cyclist @entity9 was killed before the @entity19 family until now he was regularly described by detectives as ‘ collateral damage ’ to what looked like the professional assassination of @entity26 engineer @entity24 , 50 , his dentist wife @entity27 , 47 , and his 74 - year - old @entity30 mother - in - law , @entity29			1
all were all found dead in the family @entity31 in an attack which left mr @entity19 ’s seven year old daughter @entity34 severely wounded , and his four - year - old @entity35 traumatised			2
but the latest ballistic report into the atrocity reveals that mr @entity9 was the first to be attacked			1
forensic examinations of the soles of victims ’ shoes combined with a detailed analysis of bullet trajectories reveal that mr @entity19 was outside the car with @entity34 while the gunman was targeting mr @entity9			1
burial : relatives of @entity9 at @entity49 after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation mr @entity19 is said to have been ‘ surprised ’ by what he saw , and tried to get back into the car , where the rest of the family were waiting			1
but , in his haste and panic , mr @entity19 reversed the @entity31 into a muddy bank where the rear axle of the estate car got stuck			0
violent killings : aerospace engineer @entity24 from @entity26 , was murdered in a suspected assassination alongside his wife and mother - in - law it was then that the killer shot him repeatedly in the head , and also used a semi-automatic gun to murder his mother and mother - in - law , sitting in the back seat of the car			2
the assassin then returned to ‘ finish the cyclist off ’ , said an investigating source who made details of the ballistics report public			0
the report also shows that the cyclist ’s body was moved at some point			0
the long waited report appears to confirm that just one gunman was involved in the attack , and that he turned from ‘ one victim to another in quick succession ’			2
police now believe that this modus operandi suggests the work of an amateur , rather than a ‘ professional assassin ’			0
a month ago mr @entity9 ’s body was ‘ temporarily buried ’ in a secret ceremony , even though this went against the wishes of his family , who had asked for him to be cremated			1
thirty people attended the funeral , which took place in a closed burial site which was deliberately kept hidden from the media			0
@entity10 investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘ double life ’ and been the intended target of the shooting			1
mr @entity9 worked for @entity108 , a subsidiary of the @entity110 , specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers			2
he had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his new partner , a pharmacist , gave birth in june			0
@entity10 police inspect a drain under the road to the murder scene at @entity121 during their investigations mr @entity9 was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside			1
mr @entity19 was involved in a dispute with his brother , @entity128 , over their father ’ s will , and had changed the locks on the family home before they went on holiday to keep his sibling out			0
mr @entity19 also kept an illegal @entity137 defence weapon at home – suggesting that he lived in fear of attack			0
both @entity34 and @entity35 are now back in @entity5 and being kept at a secret location			0
@entity142 , a 53 - year - old @entity143 who used to be in the @entity144 , was the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle			0
the family left their @entity150 campsite after two nights and moved to the @entity153 campsite , which overlooks @entity15 peaceful spot : walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of @entity160 where the @entity161 and @entity9 were murdered			1

@entity9 was shot up to seven times in the attack in eastern @entity10
until now he had been described as ' collateral damage ' in the massacre
