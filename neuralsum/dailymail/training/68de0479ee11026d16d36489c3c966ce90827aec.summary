@entity0 can recall days standing on the game ’s edge , watching the ball sailing through the sky towards @entity5 , so he does not hesitate to defend @entity6 against accusations of too much flair and too little caution			1
‘ i ’ve played in lots of different teams , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve played long balls and short balls and , believe me , if you love football you want to play the @entity17 way			1
‘ when i joined @entity19 and we had big @entity5 , @entity21 and @entity22 , the football was very direct because of the players we had			2
@entity18 started to buy more quality players and tactics progressed , but at the start we were very physical			2
@entity0 has praised @entity6 's style of football ahead of the north @entity31 derby the @entity32 has revealed he thought his club manager was going to leave the club at the end of last season @entity0 reserved special praise for team - mates @entity38 ( left ) and @entity40 ( right ) ‘ we were the best in the league at doing that , so why would we not play long ball ? that ’s why he put me on the wing , so i could cross the ball , as i did n’t get it in midfield			1
‘ @entity17 do n’t have to change			1
the manager believes in this style 100 per cent but we have to find our defensive solidity			2
it ’s one thing to be cautious and another to be careless			2
’ @entity17 ’s new captain is protective of the @entity6 philosophy			1
the 32 - year - old @entity56 shares the same principles not only in style of football but also regarding loyalty in the dressing room			2
‘ he defends his players 100 per cent and that ’s something that matters , ’ said @entity0			1
that does not change if it is teenage full back @entity67 or the club ’s record signing @entity40 , who responded to criticism last week with a goal at @entity72			1
‘ when you have players like @entity40 with everything he involves — his price , his personality — people will either love him or not like him at all , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ when you ’re an artist , you ’re never going to perform nine out of 10 every week			2
it ’s much more difficult for a creative player to perform at that level			2
@entity17 captain @entity0 used to play alongside @entity84 during his time at @entity86 @entity0 has revealed @entity88 boss @entity84 used to treat him like a son when they were club team - mates they met in @entity93 in 2001 and the bond remains unbroken , although it might be tested when @entity17 captain @entity0 faces a @entity88 side managed by his former team - mate @entity84 on saturday			1
‘ he was like a father figure for me , ’ said @entity0 , as he explained how centre half @entity84 took him under his wing when he joined @entity86 on loan from @entity100			1
‘ he really looked after me as a young player and i appreciate what he did for me			0
it was the start of my career and i ’d just come into the team			2
‘ i was playing in front of the back four and he was the centre back , the captain			2
he has been one of my biggest influences and showed me how to behave as a footballer			0
' ‘ the opposition always try and stop you , so sometimes you do n’t shine			0
and then people ask : “ why do n’t you shine ? you did n’t do anything in the game			0
” when that happens you get criticised , especially when it happens in big games			0
but you can not deny @entity40 is a special player : his movement , his calmness , his final ball is superb			1
’ @entity0 has witnessed high quality at close quarters during a career spanning 15 years			1
‘ at @entity100 , we had @entity130 and the way he hit the ball was unbelievable , ’ said the @entity17 captain			1
‘ in terms of quality , technique , imagination , the best was probably @entity137			0
some of the things he did with the ball i had never seen in my life			0
but we have talented players at @entity17			1
’ @entity0 picked out @entity38			1
he lovingly described him as ‘ one of my little joys ’ and added : ‘ the potential he has is second to none			0
if he really wants to , really focuses , he can go to the very top			0
‘ he has the speed and skill to become an unbelievable winger , but he has the vision of a midfielder , and that ’s very difficult to find			0
defensively , he needs to improve , but he has time and people to help him			0
’ @entity0 admits he had started to wonder about @entity17 without @entity6			1
at two goals down to @entity161 in the @entity163 final , with the manager ’s unsigned contract still on the table , doubts played on his mind			1
‘ he was n’t clear with his future , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he always said he wanted to stay but he did n’t sign			0
in the semi-final — or even in the final — we never knew what was going to happen			0
if we lost the @entity161 game we ’d be talking about a different story			0
that would have started a period of reflection and decision			0
it was a big game in @entity17 ’s history			2
we won the first trophy in nine years			0
‘ you can go from being criticised to being hailed very quickly			0
but i worry for the young lads			0
when i came to the @entity184 , what i liked about the culture was that clubs protected their players and made it hard for people to knock your confidence			0
but now it ’s impossible			0

the @entity32 had doubts regarding his manager 's future at the club
@entity0 has heaped praise on team - mate @entity38
