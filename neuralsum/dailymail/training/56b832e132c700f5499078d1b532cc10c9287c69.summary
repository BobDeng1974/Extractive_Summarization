by @entity0 it is one of the few certainties of air travel			2
you can normally assume that – after all the ticket checks and security procedures – if you are allowed onto an aircraft , it is the plane that will be taking you to your destination			2
' traumatised ' : @entity10 found herself at the wrong airport but this was not the case for a @entity15 holidaymaker who found herself 300 miles from home last week after low - cost carrier @entity17 dropped her in the wrong country			1
this mistake led to red faces at the airline – and a long taxi ride for the weary tourist			1
@entity10 , 27 , from @entity25 , had just enjoyed a ten - day break in @entity27 with her family			1
she was due to fly home from @entity30 , in the south - west of @entity27 , on friday – and was booked onto the 11.05pm @entity17 flight to @entity32			1
three hours later , she found herself not just at the wrong airport , but in the wrong country , after the plane landed at @entity34			1
the confusion began at @entity36			0
‘ the screen said to go to gate 33 for the flight to @entity32 , ’ ms @entity10 says			1
‘ but when i went to the desk it said @entity34			0
’ ‘ when i asked at the desk , they said “ this is the right one ”			0
‘ i asked them to check again just before we boarded , but they still said i was in the right place			0
‘ i got to my seat fine			0
the plane was quite empty anyway			0
’ despite the assurances that she was on the right flight , @entity10 's nightmare situation was confirmed when the captain told the passengers they were just one hour from touching down in @entity57			1
forced to apologise : @entity17 put @entity10 onto the wrong flight at @entity36 when the plane landed , @entity10 met a @entity17 manager , who apologised for the mistake			1
her luggage was nowhere to be seen			0
the airline decided to call for a taxi to take her on a five - hour journey back to @entity25			1
but @entity10 said the gesture was not enough			1
she still has n't received her baggage , and she wants compensation for her whole ordeal			0
‘ the manager said it should n't have happened , and that i could have been a terrorist or anything ’ she says			0
‘ he ordered me a taxi all the way back to @entity25 , and the taxi driver did not want the journey at all			2
‘ i got back in the end , but all my clothes and valuables are in my suitcase that i still have n't got back , and the customer services are telling me nothing			0
' @entity17 have been unable to comment on the issue of how she ended up on the wrong flight			1
not even close : the holidaymaker wanted to go to @entity32 , but found herself at @entity86 - @entity34 however , they have said that ms @entity10 's luggage will be returned to her today			1
a spokeswoman for @entity17 said : ‘ ms @entity10 's baggage has arrived with us and will be delivered today			2
@entity17 apologises for the inconvenience			2
’ @entity10 , who lives in @entity93 , a suburb of @entity25 , says : ‘ i asked twice if i was in the right place , and each time they said that i was			2
‘ i still ca n't believe what has happened			0
' i wo n't be travelling with @entity17 again			0
i 'm scared to even fly at all now			2
‘ i was on my own , which made it worse			0

@entity10 wanted to fly to @entity32 , but landed at @entity86 - @entity102
@entity104 apologises after 27 - year - old was put onto the wrong flight
*budget* carrier forced to *pay* for *expensive* taxi ride to take passenger home
