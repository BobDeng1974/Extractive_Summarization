it houses some cutting - edge manufacturing facilities including its factory , wind tunnel , simulators , r&d centres for the @entity7 team as well as the top secret centre where the @entity1 road cars are developed			1
in 1993 @entity44 , launched the @entity45 , which 20 years on , it is still regarded by many as the greatest supercar of all time			0
more recently , it has rolled out both the @entity24 and @entity50 high - performance sports cars and the @entity52 - its newest supercar			2
proving that grubby production lines have come a very long way , @entity1 's airy and stylish production centre was opened in 2011 and is where all the road cars are produced			1
the company started life 50 years ago and its factory in @entity61 is pictured in 1973 @entity1 's headquarters ( pictured ) , which includes the @entity7 factory , were designed by architect sir @entity32 and opened by the @entity33 in 2004 it includes a production line where cars are built by hand , a paint shop and a rolling road where cars are tested before going out on a test drive ahead of being shipped off to the customer			1
the internal space is large enough to accommodate three jumbo jets , but the huge building in @entity73 is largely hidden from view and is carbon neutral			0
the production centre has the capacity to produce 4,500 cars a year , a number that will be realised in 2015 when the company ’s model portfolio expands to three separate models - the @entity24 , forthcoming @entity52 and a mystery unnamed model			1

he said : “ @entity1 ’s first and founding principle was to compete successfully in motor sport and particularly @entity7			0
' that goal has taken us to great heights , from an engineering and innovation perspective , and by rewarding our people for their endeavours over many long seasons of top level motor racing			0
' but despite all the trophies and great racing successes , there comes a time when the maturity of a company and its future development depends on broadening its activities			0
the internal space is large enough to accommodate three jumbo jets , but the huge building in @entity73 is largely hidden from view and is carbon neutral it used to take 10 days to transform a pile of raw materials into @entity1 's current supercar , the @entity24 ( pictured ) but it now takes around five as the process has evolved to become more streamlined ' we have long held the dream of building a range of innovative @entity1 sports cars			1
sports cars that take the raw elements of @entity7 principles , processes and performance and forge them into a unique package that adds the requirements of quality , efficiency , comfort and reliability – traditionally opposing goals that i know we can deliver			0

' the scale and grandeur of the main hall is a fitting complement to the perfection of the @entity1 cars , which emerge from its production line			1
' the company has come a long way from its beginnings in the @entity192 suburb of @entity193 before settling on a small factory in @entity61 , near @entity195			2
