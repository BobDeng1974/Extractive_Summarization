by @entity0 @entity1 was ruled out of the @entity3 final after suffering a calf injury in @entity6 's warm up at the @entity7 in @entity8 , but did n't have to look far to be cheered up			1
the @entity10 midfielder had model girlfriend @entity11 to fall back on after being ruled out of the showdown with @entity13 , who was watching on from the crowd			1
the injury forced manager @entity17 to put @entity18 in the side for his first - ever competitive start , but the 23 - year - old lasted just half an hour himself			1
disappointed : @entity11 , @entity1 's girlfriend , was in the crowd for the @entity3 final in @entity8 plan b : it is n't all bad for @entity1 , who gets to watch the final with @entity11 instead of playing out : @entity1 ( left ) was unable to start for @entity6 in the @entity3 final 2014 due to injury @entity18 could n't have asked for a bigger game to make his first start in , but looked relaxed in the build up as he spun the ball on his finger in the tunnel			1
the youngster , though , was injured after clashing his head with @entity38 's shoulder and had to be substituted after 31 minutes for @entity39			1
as for @entity13 , @entity40 was absent after struggling with a thigh injury			0
the @entity10 star missed the semi-final win over @entity44 , and was a blow for @entity46 ahead of the @entity3 showdown			2
@entity46 had @entity48 to lead the way with @entity50 , who missed a golden chance to give @entity13 the lead on the 20 - minute mark			0
@entity54 started on the bench , having struggled with a thigh injury of his own , but came on for the second half			0
@entity58 : @entity18 looked relaxed ahead of the @entity3 final as he spun the ball in the tunnel in the thick of it : @entity18 tackles @entity63 during the @entity3 final before being substituted ouch : @entity18 gets hit in the face by @entity13 's @entity38 's shoudler with @entity66 behind him in the space of just a couple of hours , @entity67 midfielder @entity18 has endured the full range of emotions , enjoying a stroke of huge personal fortune , as @entity1 's niggle in the warm - up to the @entity3 final against @entity13 handed him a first competitive start on the grandest stage			1
then , however , he suffered a cruel twist of fate , as a nasty head collision saw him exit the match after just half - an - hour			0
here , @entity82 provides all you need to know about the unfortunate @entity18 ...			2
so tell me a little bit about @entity18 , the poor @entity67 who headed off the pitch just half - an - hour into the @entity87 ... the @entity67 central midfielder is 23 years old and enjoyed a breakthrough season in the @entity90 on loan at @entity92 , as his side finished sixth in the top flight			2
he emerged through the youth team at @entity96 , where he will return to next season , and is recognised as one of the standout talents in @entity6 after a previous impressive loan spell in the second division with @entity102			0
what kind of player is he ? an indefatigable midfielder , who works relentlessly in the central positions for his team			0
he does much of the unseen work and he is not dissimilar in style to @entity1 , who he replaced after the warm up in the @entity3 final			1
so has he been a fixture in the @entity6 national squad ? no , @entity18 was n't even picked in @entity17 's first provisional squad for the @entity3 at the beginning of may			1
however , the coach soon decided that he required extra midfield bodies as players such as @entity1 and @entity119 recovered from injury , while @entity121 had already been ruled out			0
@entity18 replaced forward @entity122 in the squad and then impressed in training to such an extent that he was included in the 23 - man pool for @entity127			2
has he been called into action at the @entity3 ? he has barely featured , appearing only as a substitute in the 89th minute against both @entity130 and @entity131			0
the @entity3 final on sunday evening marked his first competitive start for @entity6			1
that seems like a brutal induction ... ? well , it was n't planned that way			0
@entity1 pulled up in the warm up and @entity17 handed @entity18 the nod			1
sadly , though , it was destined to be a short - lived experience			0
how was he injured ? @entity141 defender @entity38 crashed into @entity18 as the two challenged a bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area			2
it was a really heavy collision and @entity18 looked visibly disorientated and was then replaced after just 30 minutes			1
at 23 , we 're sure that he will be back for more in future major tournaments			0
video @entity67 fans take to the beach in celebration			0
