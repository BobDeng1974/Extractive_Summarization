the ex-wife of a mining tycoon claims she is facing homelessness - despite being hugely wealthy on paper - because her ex-husband has failed to honour a £ 2 million divorce payout			2
@entity5 , 47 , claims her former partner , @entity6 , agreed to ' maintain ' her ' for life ' , but has left her hanging ' between the devil and deep blue sea '			2
since their marriage failed and he left the £ 1.8m family home in @entity17 in 1999 , the mother - of - two says his reluctance to pay up has caused her a dramatic fall from grace			2
@entity5 claims her ex-husband @entity20 owes her £ 2million from a divorce settlement and that his haphazard payments to her have meant she now faces homelessness because of rent arrears she is now threatened with life on the street as court proceedings are underway to evict her and her two daughters from their @entity30 home over £ 50,000 in rent arrears			1
mr @entity20 , 49 , says he is simply unable to help as he is battling cancer and has ' run out of money '			1
senior family judge , @entity34 , heard that mrs @entity5 's comfortable home life was shattered when she and her husband , who specializes in brokering mining deals , separated in 1997 , then divorced two years later			1
mrs @entity5 was initially handed the matrimonial home in @entity17 , north @entity39 , and given ' solid ' maintenance payments for her and their children as part of her divorce settlement			1
her barrister , @entity44 , said things began to go seriously wrong when mr @entity20 ' failed ' to keep up mortgage payments on the house			0
mrs @entity5 says that forced her to sell the home in 2004 - for £ 1m less than it is worth today			1
she was then unable to buy a new house as the legal costs of her settlement dispute mounted and she moved into a rented home with her daughters , initially in @entity17			1
however , they later moved to a ' cheaper ' £ 6,000 - a - month mews house in @entity30 , which mr @entity20 paid for			1
but the former couple could still not get along , and after a further decade of bitter wrangling over money , mrs @entity5 says mr @entity20 still owes her £ 2m			1
the £ 1.8m @entity17 home that @entity20 and mrs @entity5 shared before their divorced in 1999 mr @entity44 told the judge that the mrs @entity5 's troubles escalated when , in october last year , her ex-husband stopped paying the rent on her home in @entity30			1
as a result she has racked up £ 50,000 in rent arrears			1
mrs @entity5 and her daughters , aged 20 and 21 , are facing eviction proceedings in the coming days			2
because they are unlikely to qualify for council assistance , they are facing life without a roof over their head , the @entity71 heard			0
mr @entity44 said : ' his ex-wife and his two daughters , who both still live at home , are being pushed out			0
' he explained that , although mr @entity20 is still paying his ex-wife about £ 4,000 a month , his ' haphazard and unpredictable payments ' mean she ca n't get a deposit together or provide the proof of regular income necessary to get a new rented home			1
mr @entity44 said : ' he is giving her money on a drip feed basis , preventing her from renting anywhere else			0
' ' in the eyes of the local authority , the wife , in light of her rent arrears , will be classed as intentionally homeless and will be unable to seek assistance under the @entity96			2
' she is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea			0
' mr @entity44 said mr @entity20 had access to money ' it is a matter of how he wants to apply it '			0
the @entity30 home where mrs @entity5 and her two daughters have racked up £ 50,000 in rent arrears mr @entity20 's lawyer , @entity105 , said his client was in poor health and was also suffering financially , saying he was ' in a similarly parlous position to his former wife '			1
mr @entity105 said mr @entity20 made his money through introduction fees for mining and associated deals , the last of which that netted any money was in 2013			0
he said that was why mr @entity20 stopped paying his ex-wife 's rent			0
the barrister added that mr @entity20 is living in a housing association flat and ca n't even afford to pay for proper cancer treatment			1
he did n't attend the proceeding because he was in hospital , @entity34 was told			0
mr @entity105 argued that the ' ancient divorce ' should not still be hanging over mr @entity20 's head after 15 years			0
the amount owed to mrs @entity5 is also in dispute			2
at an earlier hearing mr @entity20 had been criticised for his ' poor payment record , his repeated breach of the duty of full and frank disclosure , his manipulation of the trial process and his presentation of a dishonest case , ' including ' producing rather questionable medical certificates '			0
mr @entity44 disputed mr @entity20 's claim to poverty , saying he was n't living in local authority accommodation			0
he added that , even if mr @entity20 is in trouble financially , ' there is the possibility for his wealthy friends to dig him out of a hole			0
' lord @entity34 expressed dismay at the havoc being wrought on the family by the couple 's marathon divorce			0
he said : ' i do n't know , but i strongly suspect , what the state of affairs is in the relationship between the husband and the wife			0
but what of the relationship between him and his daughters ? ' situations like this do enormous damage to relationships			0
' lord @entity34 said the orders made by the court had not been honoured and ' haphazard and unpredictable ' payments had caused mrs @entity5 's predicament			2
he said : ' there is clearly a pressing need to try to save the housing of mrs @entity5 and her daughters , because of the lack of options open to them '			1
clearing the way for mrs @entity5 to take debt enforcement action against her ex , he added : ' what she needs is cash at the moment			1
' outside court , mrs @entity5 described what is happening to her and her daughters as ' an awful situation			2

@entity5 claims she and her daughters will soon be homeless
despite her ex-husband leaving her the £ *1.8million* @entity17 home in 1999
after selling the house she rented a @entity30 flat for £ 6,000 a month
but she now owes £ 50,000 in rent arrears and faces being evicted
@entity20 claims he is battling cancer and ca n't even afford treatment
and he claims he is now forced to live in a housing association flat
the judge has allowed mrs @entity5 to seek debt enforcement action
