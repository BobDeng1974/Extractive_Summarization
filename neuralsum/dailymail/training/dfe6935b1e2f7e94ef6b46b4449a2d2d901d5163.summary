by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 05:28 est , 3 december 2012 three of the six independent advisers to @entity4 warned him not to consider compulsory state regulation of the @entity7 , it emerged last night			1
@entity8 , director of the civil rights group @entity9 , said she had serious concerns about the idea floated by the judge to force newspapers to sign up to a new regulator by law if they refused to do so voluntarily			1
miss @entity8 , one of six independent ‘ assessors ’ advising @entity4 on the inquiry , warned that the proposal would be illegal under human rights laws			1
warnings : liberty director @entity8 say imposing statutory regulations of the media would be illegal last night it emerged that two other advisers had also urged against even considering the route of compulsory regulation			2
a footnote to the 2,000 - page report reveals that former @entity30 political editor @entity29 and former @entity32 political editor @entity31 both told the judge it was unnecessary to consider compulsory state regulation of the @entity7 , as editors would sign up voluntarily to a tough new independent regulator			1
@entity4 did not formally recommend compulsory regulation , but suggested it should be considered if newspapers refused to sign up to independent regulation			1
miss @entity8 said she accepted his main findings but warned the nuclear option of compulsory regulation could breach the @entity42			0
she told the @entity43 : ‘ a compulsory statute to regulate media ethics in the way the report suggests would violate the @entity42 , and i can not support it			0
it would mean the @entity7 was being coerced in being held to higher standards than anyone else , and this would be unlawful			0
’ unnecessary law : two of @entity4 's advisors - @entity31 , far left , and @entity29 , far right , said the press would sign up willingly , eliminating the need for a law not recommended : @entity4 did not advise compulsory regulation , but suggested it should be considered if media outlets would not sign up on their own accord in a separate interview with the @entity61 miss @entity8 said she did not want to go beyond the ‘ carrots and sticks ’ proposed in the report that meant newspapers which signed up to a new watchdog would be subject to lower penalties when they got things wrong compared with those that did not			1
‘ the bombshell , or the difference , is what do you do if people do n’t join the club or do n’t set up a club ? @entity4 does n’t want compulsory regulation of the @entity7 , but he says if they do n’t play ball , politicians may have to consider it			2
that is where i get off the bus , ’ she said			0
chancellor @entity86 said @entity89 ‘ spoke very powerfully about the risks of legislation ’ and urged the press to ‘ get on ’ with setting up a new watchdog			0
but shadow culture secretary @entity92 claimed miss @entity8 was ‘ wrong ’ to suggest that compulsory regulation would be illegal			2
@entity93 to head : @entity94 's @entity92 wants compulsory regulation of the press whilst chancellor @entity86 supported @entity89 and urged the press to set up its own independent regulator in a footnote to his report , @entity4 recorded : ‘ @entity8 advised against the contemplation of any element of compulsory backstop standards regulation of the press in the event of the inability or unwillingness of the press to implement the recommendations			2
' she would prefer in that event to see a strengthening of the financial assistance available to those who feel their rights have been abused by the press in order to help them defend those rights in court			0
’ @entity4 ’s proposals would involve a major change in the law which would give the broadcasting watchdog @entity122 a legal duty to oversee the activity of a new ‘ independent ’ press regulator			1
critics fear this could lead to state interference by the back door as @entity122 ’s chairman is appointed by ministers and the watchdog has sweeping powers to revoke the licences of errant broadcasters			0
in a statement last night , @entity9 confirmed that it had concerns about the role proposed for @entity122 , adding : ‘ @entity9 would rather leave the question of whether the tests are met to the courts and not involve a quango which is ultimately appointed by politicians			0

@entity145 says law forcing papers to sign up to regulator is illegal
@entity151 political editor @entity29 and former @entity32 political editor @entity31 both said law was unnecessary
the two advisors to @entity4 believe editors will sign up voluntarily
