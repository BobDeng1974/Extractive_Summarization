he 's the airline boss who called his own customers ' stupid ' and told refund - hunters to ' f * * * off '			1
but it seems @entity6 's @entity5 is finally ending his not - so - friendly approach to customer service - and admits he should have done so a long time ago			1
with profits and passenger traffic on the rise amid a charm offensive , the divisive chief executive told @entity14 : ' we should have been nicer to customers earlier than we have been '			1
mr @entity26 said he realises that his mentor and @entity6 co-founder , the late @entity30 , was on to something when he campaigned for a customer - friendly airline			1
he said : ‘ the thing that we repeatedly would have clashed over was my determination to make @entity6 the lowest cost airline in @entity37 and @entity30 ’s desire to make it the most beloved airline in @entity37			1
‘ i think the @entity42 programme we ’ve launched in the last 12 months and the significant improvements we ’ve made in the customer experience , and the way that customers have responded to that , would suggest that he was right			2
’ mr @entity26 added : ‘ he wanted it to be very low cost and very profitable but then he also wanted it to be winning awards for customer service and being beloved , and the two generally do n’t match , but i think he was probably a little bit too extreme on the customer service side and i was certainly too extreme on being low cost and mean			2
‘ but i ’m leaning over the last year or two that a lot of what he was saying was actually right , we should have been nicer to customers earlier than we have been			0
’ in response to his critics or sceptics , mr @entity26 insists the no - frills carrier ’s friendlier approach is not a gimmick or a temporary effort and they are ‘ real ’ and ‘ genuine ’ changes			2
mr @entity5 says the carrier 's attempt to improve customer service is not a gimmick or temporary effort @entity6 's effort to win over customers includes a softer stance on baggage charges and booking conditions he said : ‘ this is a change			1
we have just completed the first year , i think we have two more years of the program to roll out where you ’re going to see more and more focus on improving the experience and actively listening to customers and trying to provide them with the services they ’re looking for			0
‘ as i said myself if i had known being nicer to our customers was going to work so well i would have done it years ago			0
’ @entity6 has implemented a number of measures to improve its image and address the impact that poor customer service has had on sales			2

on the no refund policy : ' you 're not getting a refund so f * * * off			0
we do n't want to hear your sob stories			0
what part of ' no refund ' do n't you understand ? ' on a passenger charged £ 236 in fees for forgetting to print boarding cards : ' we think mrs @entity137 should pay 60 euros for being so stupid ... there are 0.02 per cent of passengers who are equally stupid			0
we say quite politely to those passengers , b * * * * * off ' on removing toilets and charging ' per pee ' : ' we are flying aircraft on an average flight time of one hour around @entity37			0
what the hell do we need three toilets for ? if you get rid of two [ toilets ] you can get six seats on a 737 ' on what powers his planes : ' all flights are fuelled with @entity152 and my bull * * * * ' travellers appear to be warming up to @entity6 ’s effort to revamp its image with the airline expecting more passengers and a higher net profit than originally forecast this fiscal year			2
it expects to carry 87 million customers , an increase of one million from the previous forecast , and it has raised its full year net profit towards the upper end of its previously guided range of £ 484m to £ 507m			0

mr @entity26 told @entity14 that the airline is also looking to offer flights between @entity179 and @entity180 and @entity181 in @entity182 , but talks that began six months ago are facing a hurdle			1
he said : ‘ the problem at the moment is the @entity192 , despite the fact that they say @entity182 is one of their target markets , are n’t willing to support the launch of services into @entity182 so we ’re not willing to open up @entity182 until we get support from the @entity179 authorities			2
’ the 53 - year - old @entity179 executive has been at the helm of @entity6 for 20 years and recently agreed to a five - year extension that will keep him with the airline through 2019			1

he said : ‘ we fought a lot made up a lot and achieved a lot together			0
‘ i learned his ambition , his world vision			0
