@entity0 's today dumped plans for dozens of new superstores after it announced pre-tax losses of £ 290million in the last six months and warned they may be squeezed for years			1
@entity5 's third biggest chain , behind @entity6 and @entity7 , said today it needs to respond to changing shopping habits			1
customers have been flocking to discounters like @entity11 and @entity12 , smaller convenience stores or shopping online			1
in the face of its worst results for a decade the supermarket giant admitted it needs to improve the quality of 3,000 own - brand products and would invest £ 150million in cutting its prices			1
struggling : @entity0 's reported pre-tax losses of £ 290m for the past six months as it said it would launch a price war to win back customers the cost of writing down the value of existing stores and those sites which will no longer be developed meant the supermarket giant plunged to a loss of £ 290million in the six months to september 27			1
new chief executive @entity30 , who replaced @entity31 over the summer , said @entity5 's grocery market is going through a ' once - in - a - generation ' transformation - and @entity35 's needs to cut prices to compete			1
he told @entity37 : ' we 've had one of the most challenging market conditions i 've seen in my 30 - year career ; a culmination of structural change in our industry , customers shopping more frequently			1
' a period of deflation , which happens once every 10 years but actually fantastic for customers , so customers are seeing prices coming down '			1
but despite the change in habits he does not believe it is the end for superstores			0
the retailer said its underlying profits for the six months to september 27 were 6.3 per cent lower at £ 375 million in the 28 weeks to september 27 - compared to £ 433million in the same period last year			2
but it had to write - off £ 628million from the value of its existing supermarkets and because of its mothballed developments			2
the ultra-competitive market means it expects its like - for - like sales to fall over ' the next few years ' after reporting a 2.1 per cent drop in the period			2
and it warned its second half profits were likely to be worse			0
the company said : ' the grocery sector is undergoing structural change as customers shop more frequently , using online , convenience and discount channels more			0
' we expect supermarket like - for - like sales in the sector to be negative for the next few years , but we have robust plans to address this challenge			1

the prices for @entity11 were not included in the study however , it tries to match the figures charged by @entity12			1
the @entity82 magazine was not able to make an exact like for like comparison , however the products were as close as it could find			0
it said : ‘ @entity6 is working hard to close the gap			0
@entity92 has promised to refund the difference via vouchers			0
but on the evidence of @entity12 ’s first guest appearance in @entity82 33 , the big four are still trailing in its wake			0
