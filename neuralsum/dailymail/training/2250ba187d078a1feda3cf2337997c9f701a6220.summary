' @entity1 commissioner @entity0 , shown during a july 23 congressional hearing , said budget cuts could delay tax refunds , but also allowed that fewer audits would be performed revenge ? house speaker @entity26 ( left ) and incoming senate majority leader @entity27 ( right ) worked in their respective chambers to craft a budget and get it to president @entity31 in time to avoid a government shutdown – and the @entity1 , whose muscle will be needed to enforce the unpopular @entity35 law , was one agency to see its ox gored in the process in recent years , the @entity1 says it was able to issue most tax refunds within 21 days , if the returns were filed electronically			1

@entity68 said the @entity1 is imposing a hiring freeze , except for emergencies , and is eliminating almost all overtime			0
' in some ways , these budget cuts are really a tax cut for tax cheats , ' @entity0 said			1
' because to the extent we have fewer people to audit and enforce the tax code , that means some people cutting corners on their taxes or not complying are going to get away with it , and that is a decision that @entity42 has made			1
' the @entity87 represents @entity1 workers			0
@entity87 president @entity89 said waits at @entity1 walk - in centers will stretch for hours and ' correspondence will continue to pile up and taxpayers will wait longer and longer for a response			1
' ' starving the @entity1 hurts more than just the agency 's workforce , it hurts all taxpayers , ' @entity89 said			1
holding the bag : @entity31 insisted on a comprehensive budget by a mid-deadline , but that meant spending in some areas had to be compensated with cuts in others – including the hated @entity1 @entity0 called thursday 's news conference to highlight tips for choosing a qualified tax preparer			1
