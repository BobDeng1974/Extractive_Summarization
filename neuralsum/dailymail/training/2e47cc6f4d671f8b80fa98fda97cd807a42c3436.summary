sitting in the dentist ’s waiting room , the receptionist called out brightly : ‘ mrs @entity3 ? ’ i was on my feet without hesitation , even though the word ‘ mrs ’ was almost as painful as the dentist ’s drill			1
i have n’t been a mrs for nearly 30 years and , truth to tell , i ’m not really a @entity3 either			1
it is my former husband ’s surname , not mine , but it ’s far too late to change and revert to my original surname			2
that is why i felt a pang of jealousy when i read in last week ’s @entity22 that @entity23 is to become @entity23 again			1
@entity24 felt a pang of jealousy when she read in last week ’s @entity22 that @entity23 ( left ) is to become @entity23 again , having kept her ex-husband @entity28 's ( right ) surname for so long she became a @entity28 in 1995 when she married @entity30 cricketer - turned - politician @entity28			1
despite their divorce in 2004 , until now she has remained a @entity28			1
ostensibly , she is going back to her maiden roots because her former husband is considering remarrying , which means there would be two mrs @entity37			1
but others have suggested @entity28 is unlikely to have been overjoyed to see the @entity28 name associated with louche comedian @entity41 , whom @entity23 dated recently			1
when my husband and i split up in 1988 , after 23 years together , i kept his name for practical reasons			1
during our married life , i had become reasonably well known as a writer and it seemed professional suicide to revert to my original name , @entity51 , a name nobody recognised			2
the name had become , as we might say today , a kind of brand			0
@entity23 is going back to her maiden roots because her former husband is considering remarrying , which means there would be two mrs @entity58 so , against my feminist principles , i had little choice but to stay with a surname that bore absolutely no relation to my status or lifestyle			1
i was , and would remain , a single woman stuck with a married name , even though i called myself @entity67 on official documents			2
@entity23 , of course , coming from such an illustrious family , will not have to reinvent herself anew with an unknown name , but will be able to pass seamlessly back from @entity28 to @entity23			1
one has to wonder why she has stuck with @entity28 for so long			1
she says she originally kept it as her two sons , @entity74 and @entity75 , felt strongly about it , but that now they ’re grown up they do n’t seem to care			0
when my sons @entity79 and @entity80 were children , it made things neat and easy for us all to have the same surname , especially when travelling as a family			0
now they are middle - aged and well - known writers themselves , i can bask in a little reflected glory			0
but it would be more dignified now , i feel , for me to have a different identity			0
there have been stories recently of women being stopped at airports because they have a different surname to their children and have had to explain at great length that they really are their mothers			0
border officials are , of course , worried about trafficking			0
but for many women these days , it is an unforeseen consequence of hanging on to your maiden name			0
i thought , when i married in 1965 at the age of 21 , that it was a legal requirement for women to take their husband ’s surname			1
it was only much later i learned it was merely a custom and never enshrined in law			0
but at the time , women who kept their own names were considered odd			0
did n’t they want to be married ? when i married at a very young age , i had not chalked up any achievements whatsoever , and so it seemed i had nothing to lose by taking my husband ’s name for all purposes			2
little did i know i would bitterly regret not hanging onto my own name , at least professionally			0
nowadays it ’s common for women to revert to their maiden names on divorce , shaking off the one associated with an ex. yet some , like @entity23 and @entity132 ( nee @entity133 ) hang onto their ex ’s name for years			1
@entity132 stayed a @entity137 for four years after splitting from footballer @entity138 , and only changed to @entity139 when she remarried earlier this year			1
among my divorced friends , every one has reverted to her maiden name or chosen another neutral surname			2
even when they remarried , most of my friends did not take their new husband ’s name			2
@entity132 stayed a @entity137 for four years after splitting from footballer @entity138 , and only changed to @entity139 when she remarried earlier this year some boyfriends i have had since my divorce have said they feel awkward about me still being called @entity3 and would prefer to think of me as @entity149 , untainted by carrying a long - ago ex ’s name			1
and there could be an identity crisis if my ex decided to remarry			0
but i think i ’m fairly safe there			0
@entity156 is 70 and took a lifelong vow of celibacy when he went to live in a spiritual retreat centre 20 years ago			0
the prospect of a school reunion where i will be surrounded by people who knew me only as @entity149 got me thinking			0
i had a go at a signature i have not used for 50 years and it felt as if i was using an alias ; as if that person is not me any more			0
so , i have had to face up to it : @entity3 , not @entity51 , will be engraved on my tombstone			2
@entity23 , sensibly , is changing her surname while she is still young enough to do so .			2

when @entity3 divorced she kept her name for practical reasons
she had been married for 23 years
@entity24 was jealous when heard @entity23 is to become @entity23
her former husband @entity28 is considering remarrying
@entity132 stayed a @entity137 for four years after splitting from footballer @entity138
she only changed to @entity139 when she remarried earlier this year
