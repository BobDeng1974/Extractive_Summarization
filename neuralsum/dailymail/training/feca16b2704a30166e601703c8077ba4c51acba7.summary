experts say champagne tastes better when served in an ordinary wine glass when toasting a special occasion with a bottle of bubbly , classy champagne flutes are the obvious choice for many			1
and while it may go against tradition , experts are urging drinkers to ditch their crystal flutes in favour of an ordinary wine glass			1
this is because higher - end brands will taste better in a broader glass , according to wine connoisseurs			2
@entity19 , a global wine ambassador for drinks company @entity21 , says a simple wine glass emphasises the aroma and fizz in better and more complex champagnes			1
' when the sparkling wine or champagne has complexity , depth and autolytic notes , such as the best cavas or champagnes , then the best option is actually to use a white wine glass in order to let the aromas express themselves better , ' he told @entity37			1
but simple sparkling wines should still be served in flutes as it keeps the drink colder for longer and shows off the bubbles better			1
' both the flute and the saucer help the aromas diffuse in different ways : the flute concentrates carbon dioxide at the top of the glass , whereas the saucer 's wide mouth means the bubbles evaporate more quickly , ' he added			0
and @entity53 , @entity55 's @entity54 has long sworn by white wine glasses for serving his champagnes because flutes can stifle the flavour of older wines			1
a champagne flute , left , concentrates carbon dioxide at the top of the glass where the wider mouth of an ordinary wine glass , right , means the bubbles evaporate more quickly he said : ' i tend to use any glass which is ample enough to allow the wine to express itself , improving the mouthfeel , but not that large a glass that it would be detrimental to the whole experience by stretching the substance of the wine too thin			2
' such a glass will also provide enough space for the wine to breathe and develop , which is typically critical for all @entity55 wines			2
' but studies have suggested flutes are better choice for champagne because they provide more of a ' nose - tingle ' than if served in wide and shallow ' coupe '			0
a study by the @entity85 in @entity86 found that champagne tastes different depending on the glass you drink it from			0
and bubbly poured into a long narrow flute gives more of a nose - tingle due to high levels of carbon dioxide at the top of the glass			0
another study by the same university said champagne should be served at room temperature because it has more bubbles			0
the study found champagne keeps its fizz for longer if served slightly warmer at around 18 ° @entity103			0

*normal* white wine glass emphasises aroma and fizz in more complex wines , says @entity19 , global ambassador for @entity21
but simple sparkling wines should still be served in flutes as it shows off bubbles better
