by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured here with her baby @entity3 , said she wants her son 's legacy to be one of happiness nearly two years ago to the day , @entity1 lost her baby when a drug - crazed intruder broke into her home and beat her 10 - month - old boy @entity11 to death			1
on june 15 , 2012 , @entity3 was killed in a senseless and unprovoked attack , bludgeoned over the head with a homemade baton more than 25 times			1
the man found guilty of the brutal killing , @entity19 , was 19 and high on the drug ice at the time			1
he is due to be sentenced on friday			2
@entity19 was on a drug - fueled crime spree which included a series of other break - ins on that night night in @entity25 , @entity26			2
despite maintaining his innocence over the murder of @entity3 , the @entity27 has called for a life sentence for @entity19			1
@entity1 told the @entity31 she knew the killer in high school , but had no connection with him since , nor at the time of her son ’s murder			1
during a plea hearing in the @entity40 in @entity25 , crown prosecutor @entity38 described the attack as ' an evil killing without any real , rational explanation '			0
' this killing falls within the worst case category of murders and as such we call for a life sentence , ' ms @entity38 said			2
news of this brutal and unprovoked attack shocked not only the community in @entity25 , but people all around @entity53			1
but @entity1 insists she does n’t want people to remember her second - born boy as the baby who was beaten to death			1
‘ instead of “ the murdered baby ” or “ the bludgeoned baby ” … we know he died traumatically beyond what words can express			2
even i ca n’t express that and i ’ve seen it , it ’s beyond horrible but i do n’t want people to remember him as that			2
’ a court heard that @entity19 broke into @entity1 's house as part of a string of burglaries , and unplugged the baby monitor before he struck @entity3 , his possible motive said to be to silence the baby			1
when @entity1 awoke the next morning her eldest son @entity60 let her know all the doors were open in the house , and they soon discovered they 'd been robbed as wallets and other belongings were missing , with their car also broken into			1
it was then @entity1 discovered her youngest child , bruised and covered in blood , beaten almost beyond recognition			2
there was ' blood everywhere ' and ' his face was swollen and bruised , he was unresponsive , ' she said in court according to the @entity105			0
the murder weapon was later discovered with both @entity107 's and @entity3 's dna on it , at @entity107 's property			1
@entity1 , 24 , now wants her child ’s legacy to be a positive one , and she is trying to combat the stigma and the silence of parents who have their children taken from them too soon			2
‘ i want it to be at a point where it ’s not weird or taboo anymore , where it ’s just normal , ’ she told the @entity31			0
@entity19 , pictured here in a police interview , was found guilty of @entity3 's murder and is set to be sentenced on friday ‘ for them to speak their names and feel freely enough to do that … they can talk about them and whenever they ’re comfortable they can tell the story of their child			1
’ @entity60 , now nearly five , is @entity1 ’s eldest child and was taken away from his mother by the @entity135 ( @entity135 ) almost immediately after his little brother ’s death			1
‘ i did n’t know what to do , because i ’d had at least one child since i was 19 and i ’d always had someone to look after and then it was just me again at 22 , ’ @entity1 said			2
' in a harrowing piece @entity1 penned herself published on @entity143 , the 24 - year - old described in heartbreaking detail how her life has dramatically altered since the murder of her young son			1
' a nightmare i never woke from again			0
i awoke to find my son , my world , my mini me , stolen … ' she has also spoken of of @entity60 ’s trust issues since the death of his brother , and claims the way her family was treated by the @entity135 still affects her relationship with her eldest son			1
‘ they were very inconsiderate , compassionless ; they had no empathy at all			0
they had no information bar what they had read in the newspaper , which was n’t accurate at times to start with			0
' i think he [ @entity60 ] suffered the most , he ’s very similar to me i think , he thinks a lot , he expresses passion and he ’s very empathetic			0
@entity1 says if @entity3 ( left ) had n't been killed it could have been @entity60 ( right ) , and she has to let go of the what - ifs supervised visits were the only way @entity1 was able to see @entity60 for months , as she had to be cleared of @entity3 ’s murder before her first son was returned			1
she struggled daily without either of her sons by her side , and claimed the @entity135 were misinformed and acted insensitively during some of her darkest days			0
@entity1 said she was blindsided by officials from the service who turned up at her house the same day of the murder and tried to ban her from seeing her older son @entity60 at all for the days following			1
‘ they tried to make it from the day @entity3 died [ friday ] , all that weekend and the monday that i was n’t allowed to have any contact with my son [ @entity60 ] at all			1
‘ in the long run they made sure i was n’t a drug dealer after i ’d already been cleared by the police and the police charged @entity197			0
[ then ] once they cleared me and made sure i ’m okay and i can parent they gave me a half - arsed sorry and gave him back			0
after putting me through an emotional hell for months			0
’ since the attack @entity1 has struggled with crippling anxiety , depression and struggles in social situations			1
@entity1 and her family were due to move out of their home the day after @entity3 was murdered , and most of the house was already packed into boxes			1
but she said she ca n’t let the thoughts of what could have happened rule her life			0
@entity1 hopes that speaking out about the loss of @entity3 will encourage other parents to share their experiences ‘ i can think about what - ifs until i am 100 , easily , the biggest one is what if i put @entity3 in with me that night cause he was sick , like i used to , and i thought no i do n’t want to break the sleeping cycle			1
‘ the constant thought of that was what if he had hurt @entity60 ? would he have hurt my older son ? ‘ if i take one out of the equation , it could mean it takes another one , it could have been me instead or it could have been my partner at the time instead , ’ she said			0
‘ i for a long time blamed myself for it , and no matter which way i went i ca n’t find any answers for any where it ’s my fault			0
’ one of the hardest times of the year for @entity1 and @entity60 can be around @entity238 , when all @entity60 wishes for is his little brother to come home			2
‘ he ’ll ask for a toy or a balloon to give to @entity3 , or he ’ll ask for his brother to come back			0
i think he understands he ca n’t come back but he thinks if he just keeps crying it might work just once , ’ @entity1 said			0
other days can be just as hard , and @entity1 shared a heartbreaking anecdote of the struggles her older son , who was just three when he lost his baby brother , still faces			1
@entity60 ( left ) has been the most affected by his brother 's death , and his mum @entity1 ( right ) says on christmas his only wish is for @entity3 to come home ‘ some days he will cry for no reason … he just goes to his room and he ’ll be very quiet for a time and i ’ll ask “ what are you doing little buddy ? ” and i ’ll go in there and he has his little head in his hands and he just cries			1
‘ he ’s only five in a couple of weeks and some days you would just think he ’s an adult			0
he ’s been through so much in such a short amount of time , he ’s really resilient and i could n’t be prouder of him , but he does say so many adult things and he ’s looked after me , which he never should have had to do , ever			0
' despite the unimaginable hardship @entity1 and her family have faced over the past two years , she 's doing her best to keep moving forward with her life			2
she is living with a new partner , and works in the centre of town , though sometimes finds it hard when she is recognised			0
the mother now looks at the death of her child almost philosophically , refusing to hide her grief and insisting on speaking out about @entity3			2
‘ i think he was sent to me for a reason , so i try to speak out as much as i can about child loss so that it does n’t stay hidden anymore and it ’s not shameful to speak out			0
‘ i like to think he chose me for a reason and he knew it ’d be short and horrible but that i could handle it , and that he watches over me every day			0
' i like to think that one day i will see him again but until then he ’ll watch over and help me going where i ’m going , and that gives me that little bit of hope			0
