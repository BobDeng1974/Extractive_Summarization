a powerful volcanic eruption in the @entity1 has created a new island off the coast of @entity4			2
the new island is 600ft in diameter and appeared next to a small , uninhabited island in the @entity1 called @entity7			2
the mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption on wednesday in a region dubbed @entity13 – a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of @entity16			1
at that point , it was around 600ft in diameter in september a similar new island appeared off the coast of @entity30			1
it was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide / the phenomenon on the coastline near the port of @entity41 caused astonishment when it emerged from the @entity43 but , like the new islet in @entity4 , experts said it was unlikely to last long			1
although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions , they are rarely as powerful as the one that happened earlier this week			0
in fact , the forming of the new island is the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years			0
video footage showed smoke billowing from part of the ocean around the @entity23 island chain on wednesday afternoon			1
the @entity4 coastguard later confirmed it was coming from the new islet			0
this chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands			0
the islet is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor			1
volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could be as high as 1,000 ° @entity69 the mass of rock , pictured , was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region of the @entity1 dubbed @entity13 the coastguard has warned sailors to use caution in the area and avoid travelling near it until the heat from the eruption cools off			1
‘ @entity84 is still rising from the volcanic island , and we issued a navigation warning to say that this island has emerged with ash falling in the area , ’ said a spokesman for the maritime agency			2
he added that the islet may not last long due to erosion , but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new marker on the map			1
similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in @entity4 's territory that have since disappeared			2
the new islet rose into the ocean near the @entity102 , also known as the @entity23 chain			0
this chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands around 620 miles south of the @entity4 capital , pictured the islet , pictured , is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor			1
volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could be as high as 1,000 ° c. the coastguard has warned sailors to use caution in the area and avoid travelling near it until the heat from the eruption cools off ‘ if this becomes a solid island , our country 's territorial waters will expand , ’ chief cabinet secretary @entity121 said			0

in november this year , a powerful volcanic eruption in the @entity1 created a new island off the coast of @entity4 , pictured			0
the mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed @entity13 - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of @entity16 experts said the islet , pictured , may not last long due to erosion , but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new islet a new entry on the map			1

the islet is 600ft in diameter and appeared off the south coast of @entity16
it is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean bed
footage showed smoke and ash billowing from the islet on wednesday
volcanologists have warned the islet may be eroded by the tide
eruptions in the 1970s and 80s caused similar islands to rise before falling
