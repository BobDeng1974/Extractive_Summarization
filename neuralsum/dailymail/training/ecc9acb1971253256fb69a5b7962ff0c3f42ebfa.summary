members of @entity1 waved pencils in the air on tuesday night as they paid tribute to the victims of the @entity7 terror attack during president @entity8 's @entity10 address			1
speaking to a joint session of @entity1 , @entity8 , 53 , declared that @entity12 stands ' united with people around the world who 've been targeted by terrorists ' , including the 17 recently slain in @entity16			1
at the same time , dozens of people in the @entity19 chamber raised unsharpened yellow pencils into the air in a show of support for free speech following the brutal january 7 attack on the magazine			1
four hundred pencils had been brought to the address by @entity29 congresswoman @entity29 , who believed @entity1 had an opportunity on tuesday to condemn the massacre with one voice			1
speaking before the speech , mr @entity60 said he hoped the number of those involved in the display would be ' in the hundreds ' , saying : ' we 've invited all our @entity69 colleagues			2
' he added : ' the congresswoman will have pencils with her on the floor			0
the gesture is not meant to insult @entity75 nor is it an attack on @entity76			0
' there are 534 members of @entity1 , including the 100 senators who shoehorned themselves into the crowded hall			1
( one seat was vacant after former @entity84 rep. @entity83 's resignation			0
) at 4pm on tuesday , mr @entity60 said that nearly three dozen members of @entity1 had confirmed they would be participating in the @entity7 salute , which was broadcast live on television			1
however , it is currently unknown exactly how many members of @entity1 ended up doing so			2
the pencils were deliberately unsharpened due to security concerns			1
getting involved : as @entity8 spoke , dozens of people in the @entity19 chamber raised unsharpened yellow pencils into the air in a show of support for free speech following the brutal january 7 attack on the magazine @entity102 plan : four hundred pencils had been brought to the address by congresswoman @entity29 ( center ) , who believed @entity1 had an opportunity on tuesday to condemn the massacre with one voice striking : the yellow pencil has become a symbol of free expression across @entity113 follong the attack twelve people , including two police officers and five @entity7 cartoonists , were gunned down when two @entity119 gunmen stormed the magazine 's offices and opened fire			1
the following day , a @entity16 policewoman was shot dead in @entity16 's capital			0
and on friday , four hostages were killed when another @entity119 terrorist seized a @entity128 grocery store			2
addressing @entity1 , @entity8 , whose wife , @entity129 , was seated in a box with nearly two dozen specially - invited guests , said : ' we stand united with people around the world who ’ve been targeted by terrorists – from a school in @entity137 to the streets of @entity139			1
' we will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks , and we reserve the right to act unilaterally , as we ’ve done relentlessly since i took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies			0
' but he acknowledged that @entity12 has ' learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years			2
' speaking to @entity61 before the address , mr @entity60 explained that @entity16 citizens have turned ordinary pencils into protest implements in the weeks since the @entity7 attack			1
holding a pencil above ones head is now an internationally recognized disapproval of censorship			0
where was @entity161 ? a january 11 rally of millions in @entity139 went off without president @entity8 , who was reportedly watching football ; he will likely try to express his solidarity in his @entity10 address erasers : @entity75 in @entity137 and elsewhere have rallied to condemn the @entity139 magazine for showing cartoons @entity168 from @entity139 to @entity171 to @entity172 , pencils lifted skyward have carried a message of support for what @entity7 stands for – an irreverent and unapologetic mocking tone toward anyone and anything of importance			1
' we 'd like to do it every time the president refers to the victims , and every time he refers to freedom of speech or expression , ' he said			2
the idea for a pencil protest began as a @entity190 - only stunt , passed in secret from press secretary to press secretary			0
then an email from mr @entity60 to his colleagues was leaked to @entity196			0
suddenly it was a bipartisan idea , open to both sides of the aisle			0
@entity200 : as far away as the @entity202 and @entity203 – this woman demonstrated in @entity205 – people have held pencils aloft to signify the defense of free expression in the face of religious extremism ' this is something we just planned to do privately , and then it would just be a surprise during the @entity10 , ' mr @entity60 told @entity61			2
' but because my email was leaked – that 's just how it goes			0
i should have just put " confidential " on top of it , ' he joked , ' and made sure it leaked in about ten seconds			0
' separately , the @entity19 passed a resolution on tuesday officially condemning the @entity7 attack and a separate deadly act of terror at a @entity139 kosher supermarket			1
' seventeen innocents lost their lives , and this resolution carries our condolences to their loved ones , ' house speaker @entity227 said in a statement			0
' with this condemnation also comes a commitment to stand with @entity16 and our allies in confronting the grave threat radical @entity76 poses to our security and way of life , ' he said .			0
