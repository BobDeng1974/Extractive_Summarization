the @entity8 sprinter recovered to finish third behind @entity9 , and then went straight to hospital			1
‘ i was coming back and i was behind a car , ’ said @entity2 , who was returning to the peloton after an early problem with his shoes			1
‘ someone had to stop for a puncture , so the car slammed on its brakes and there was an island in the road			2
if i went right i would hit the island , so i went left and i whacked another car			2
ahead : @entity9 of @entity24 celebrates as he wins stage one of the @entity6 sprint : @entity2 powered towards the line at the end of the race to try and finish as high as he could ‘ i hit it with my left leg and i was down on the road			1
i immediately felt a lot of pain on my quadriceps			0
‘ i do n’t know what ’s wrong but it ’s f * * * * *			0
that ’s why i ’m off to hospital			2
’ that @entity2 was able to contest the final sprint at all was a surprise			1
still battling back to full fitness after suffering ligament damage when he crashed at the @entity45 , his woes continued here with his shoe problem , his crash and a compromised sprint			0
@entity2 said : ‘ i was n’t planning to sprint , it was painful			1
but after a couple of laps we decided to just try anyway , but to sprint seated because i was in pain			0
i still got third , but it ’s a shame because i really wanted to win in front of the @entity59 public			0
focus : @entity2 has suffered a difficult season and will be hoping to recover and find his form ‘ accidents like this are a part of cycling and it ’s just a matter of bad luck			1
i really hope that my luck turns in the next days			0
’ there was another crash in the final kilometre , which @entity2 avoided , but he could do nothing against @entity75 , the @entity77 sprinter who , for the second year in a row , won four stages at the @entity45			1
@entity75 won in @entity80 and @entity81 when the @entity6 was in @entity82 , having also won the first stage of the @entity84 in @entity85			1
@entity3 was billed as a re-match with @entity2 , who was at fault when he crashed in @entity80 , but the @entity24 ’s dominance continued			1
he remains unbeaten against @entity2 in head - to - head sprints			2

‘ when i was at the @entity105 earlier this year i said i would never go for it again , but then i thought i would like one more crack at this one , ’ said @entity102			0
‘ the plan is to put on some weight and i will be training for the track , so stage racing to win the @entity112 ( general classification ) will be out the window after this			0
‘ i will definitely be racing to win but whether i can is another matter			0
if i can just stay close to the big gc guys on tuesday i can be competitive			0
