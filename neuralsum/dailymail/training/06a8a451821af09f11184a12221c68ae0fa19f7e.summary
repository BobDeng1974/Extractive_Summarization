@entity0 claimed it was the only remaining question about the title credentials of this @entity4 team : could they win without @entity6 ? at @entity7 came an emphatic response			1
‘ we are strong as anyone and hungry to win the league , ’ said @entity0			1
like @entity13 , @entity4 ’s captain cherishes those victories which demand character as well as class			1
‘ we showed we have strength in depth by winning without @entity6 , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ that was the one question mark about us			2
he ’s done so well people wondered , if he was out , who could come in and do it ? @entity23 doubled @entity4 's lead at @entity25 early in the second half of their @entity28 win @entity29 ( centre ) scored past @entity31 ( right ) after a neat move involving @entity33 it seems that the @entity28 ’s penchant for own goals this weekend was contagious			1
@entity37 scored two own goals to consign @entity39 , who visit @entity4 tomorrow , to a 2 - 1 home defeat @entity42 in the @entity43			1
the result meant @entity39 slipped to third , six points behind leaders @entity47			1
‘ @entity49 was very sharp and has looked it in training			2
we have @entity53 and his qualities			2
the guys are showing maturity away from home			2
that ’s what is needed from us this year			2
’ with a five - point lead at the top and only two points dropped from eight games , @entity4 must ride out this @entity64 spell if they are to mount a genuine title challenge			1
it might be different if the @entity68 striker is ruled out long - term but at the moment it is a question of managing his injured hamstrings , in the hope he will be able to play without fear of a twang			2
@entity13 has ruled @entity6 out of the game against @entity39 in the @entity77 on tuesday and gives him ‘ very little chance ’ of starting at @entity80 on sunday			1
like @entity0 , he was quick to seize on the psychological meaning of the result			1
@entity84 @entity33 's superb free - kick put @entity4 ahead at @entity25 on their way to a vital victory @entity23 ( left ) celebrates his strike with @entity33 - after being assisted by the @entity89 midfielder ‘ there is a general feeling our team has improved because of @entity6 and @entity23 , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ and it ’s right			0
but , at the same time , this team had big improvement			0
it was good to have an important victory without the player who has scored so many goals and given us so many points			2
’ @entity4 had 72 per cent possession against @entity7 , their highest figure this season and the fifth highest in the @entity28			1
when they lost at @entity25 in march , @entity13 accused his team of lacking ‘ balls ’ , a word he refused to say on camera , so he scribbled it on a reporter ’s notepad			0
after the win on saturday , he took a pad and grinned as he wrote ‘ big balls ’			0
‘ it ’s not just about being brave , fighting a lot or coping with a physical match , ’ he said			0
‘ this was about imposing our game			2
from minute one , we pass and circulate the ball			0
control and stability , i like that			0
’ @entity33 and @entity23 scored either side of red cards for @entity127 , who will miss games against @entity80 , @entity129 ( in the @entity130 ) and @entity131 , and @entity132 , now absent for saturday ’s trip to @entity134			1
@entity135 pulled one back in stoppage - time			0
@entity0 was celebrating his 500th game as @entity4 captain in the win to continue their unbeaten start palace boss @entity141 , who was in his office with @entity13 before kick - off , watching @entity144 beat @entity145 , complained about @entity4 players intimidating referee @entity147			1
‘ four or five surrounded him , ’ @entity141 said			0
‘ i think they influenced things			0
it ’s not an even platform			0
’ @entity13 called @entity23 ’ goal ‘ scandalous ’			1
17 passes involved in the build - up that swept from end to end			0
8 players involved in the move			0
only @entity160 and @entity161 did not touch it and @entity127 had been sent off			0
9 @entity163 touches by @entity23			1
@entity4 ’s sublime goals were underpinned by a ruthlessness to rekindle memories of the first team @entity13 built at @entity168 , a decade ago			1
‘ we are reaching that level , ’ @entity13 agreed			0
others in the camp detect it , too , including @entity0 , who captained the club for the 500th time			1
there have been plenty of scrapes in the 12 years since he took the armband , but it was hard to fault his performance at @entity25			0
‘ to be captain after all these years is a great achievement , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ there will be a day when i have to hand it someone else and hang up the boots			0
but i ’m feeling great , playing well in a very good side and we ’re aiming for trophies			0
’ @entity0 admits the only question mark over @entity4 had been their capability of winning without @entity6 @entity191 pleased with team evolution ' @entity147 clearly upset @entity141 but to be fair to him , pretty much every referee does that			1
' it started when @entity147 , in keeping with current trends , chose not to caution @entity132 for his first tackle , which was a poor one			0
' to be consistent he let @entity0 escape with a similarly poor tackle because it was also his first			2
' there can be no argument about @entity127 ’s red card for a shocking tackle on @entity205 , nor the first of @entity208 ’s yellow cards — he had been given his chance			0
' his silly challenge on @entity49 then gave the @entity4 players the chance to pressurise the inexperienced @entity147 into levelling things up to 10 men a side , which he duly did			2

@entity23 scored a superb goal for @entity4 at @entity7
