@entity0 limits which apps can be used to avoid distractions , and it prevents people from contacting users unless in an emergency the average phone user unlocks their device 63 times a day , for 2 hours 49 minutes each time - a minimum of three hours a day			1
and in a move that might seem counter-intuitive , a @entity13 - based psychologist has developed an app to help wean us off our gadgets			1
called @entity0 , it limits which apps can be used to avoid distractions , or prevents people from contacting you unless in an emergency			1
it does n’t limit connectivity permanently , instead , users can enable @entity28 mode for any time when they need to focus , or at set times during the day			1
and there are various levels of customisation			0
for example , all calls , texts and notifications can be blocked during @entity0			1
alternatively , users can pre-select so - called vip contacts that are never blocked , and can get hold of the phone owner even when @entity28 is enabled			1
the app can be setup to send custom replies to anyone who tries to contact them during @entity0 , and will record all messages and notifications until connectivity is restored – meaning users do n’t miss anything , they just delay it			1
by registering calls and texts , the app can also determine that if someone is trying to call repeatedly , it may be an emergency			1
in this case , it will let the call through even if the number is n't listed as a vip			2
elsewhere , the app either limits access to apps entirely , allows access to pre-selected apps , or just limits internet access on apps			1
plus , users can track their smartphone usage , including which apps they use the most , using @entity0 's built - in analytics tool			1
@entity71 was developed by @entity13 - based psychologist @entity72 , who recently commissioned the @entity73 at @entity74 to conduct a study into smartphone usage			1
over two weeks , the study analysed the patterns of 49 participants with an average age of 34 years			0

this reveals daily and weekly habits ( right ) @entity71 was developed by @entity13 - based psychologist @entity72 , who recently commissioned the @entity73 at @entity74 to conduct a study into smartphone usage			1
over two weeks , the study analysed the patterns of 49 participants with an average age of 34 years			0
during the first week of the study , ‘ normal ’ smartphone usage was tracked			0
in the second , so - called ' intervention ' week , participants used @entity71 for at least two hours a day			1
the use of @entity0 boosted mental detachment from work after a week , by 8 per cent			2
it also led to higher work motivation ; in comparison to the first week , this increased by 5 per cent among participants			0
during the first week of the study , ‘ normal ’ smartphone usage was tracked			0
it was found that on average , each phone was unlocked 63 times a day , typically for approximately 2 hours 49 minutes each time			2
over this period , functions such as calls , sms , messenger apps and social networks were the used the most			2
and , in the case of one participant , use of @entity117 totalled 35 hours over one week , an average of 7 hours per day			0
in the second , so - called ' intervention ' week , participants used @entity71 for at least two hours a day			2
the use of @entity0 boosted mental detachment from work after one week , on average by 8 per cent , explained the researchers			2
this meant they were able to shut off and not worry about work - related problems more effectively			0
it also led to higher work motivation			0
in comparison to the first week , this increased by 5 per cent among participants			0
‘ in addition , it appears that conscious “ offtime ” positively affects work , since motivation rises			0
consequently , this usually leads to higher productivity , ’ explained study professor dr. @entity136			0
@entity71 was developed by @entity13 - based psychologist @entity72 , who recently commissioned the @entity73 at @entity74 to conduct a study into smartphone usage			1
the use of @entity0 boosted mental detachment from work after a week by 8 %			2
it also increased work motivation by 5 % ‘ the app is designed to let you unplug without missing urgent matters , ’ explained mr @entity150			0
‘ it lets you whitelist contacts who able to pierce through your downtime , like your spouse or children , but otherwise shuts down apps , calls , texts , and emails			1
‘ it can also auto - respond to incoming messages on your behalf , while maintaining a careful activity log of everything you missed while away so you can quickly catch up			0
’ the free app is available for @entity170			0
the developers said they are working on an @entity173 version .			0

@entity71 was developed by @entity13 - based psychologist @entity72
it lets users customise their connectivity - limiting app usage , calls and texts
when a phone is in @entity0 mode , only pre-selected numbers can call or text
users can also block the use of certain apps so they ’re not a distraction
app reveals how much time is spent on certain apps to *identify* habits
its effectiveness is backed up by a *university* - backed research paper
