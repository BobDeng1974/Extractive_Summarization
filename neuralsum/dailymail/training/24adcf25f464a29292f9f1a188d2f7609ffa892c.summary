the government has launched an extraordinary attack on the @entity2 for sending an inspector - branded a ' loopy @entity6 leftie - to @entity5 to criticise flagship welfare reforms			1
@entity9 party chairman @entity8 has called on @entity2 secretary general @entity10 to launch a full investigation into why an official was allowed to issue an ‘ outrageous ’ report calling for the so - called ‘ bedroom tax ’ to be abolished			1
conservatives reacted with fury to the interference of a supposedly independent observer from an international agency more closely associated with providing assistance to war zones , famines and natural disasters			0
mr @entity8 told @entity24 the government had no idea why @entity27 had come to the @entity5 to ‘ make a political point ’ at a time when ‘ there are 50million people living in shanty towns ’			1
outrageous : @entity2 secretary general @entity10 ( left ) has been urged by @entity9 party chairman @entity8 to launch an immediate inquiry into why an official was allowed to become embroiled in a political row in the @entity5 under the government 's welfare reform , social tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced since april			1
ministers say the removal of the ‘ spare room subsidy ’ brings social housing into line with the private sector where renters do not get spare rooms for free			2
the change will is expected to save around £ 500 million every year			0
but opponents including the @entity51 have dubbed it the ‘ bedroom tax ’ – a term used repeatedly by @entity54 after a two - week tour of the @entity5 investigating the policy			2
she also appeared in photographs with opponents of the policy and met with newspapers campaigning against it			0
mr @entity8 said : ' this report is an absolute disgrace			1
we think it is pretty serious when the @entity2 turns up and issues a report on a critical area of policy			1
' but miss @entity27 remained unrepentant today , insisting the policy was causing ' great stress and anxiety ' to ' very vulnerable ' people			1
after mr @entity8 appeared on the radio defending the benefits changes , @entity9 mp @entity71 wrote on @entity74 : ' @entity75 with no evidence on bedroom tax ( sic ) masquerading as serious @entity2 official on @ @entity79 demolished by @ grantshapps			1
' controversy : the @entity2 's @entity82 on the right to adequate housing , @entity27 , declared : ' my immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished ' anger : @entity90 @entity9 mp @entity71 used @entity74 to condemn the remarks by @entity54 the @entity6 , who has spent much of her five - year @entity2 post looking at human rights violations in countries including @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 , has decided that @entity5 ’s housing system is ‘ going backwards ’			1
however , it has emerged that she failed to meet officials or ministers from the @entity104 , and during her only meeting with the @entity107 , the spare room subsidy was hardly mentioned			0
mr @entity8 told @entity24 : ‘ it is pretty outrageous			1
she has done this all under the wire			0
the government was not asked or consulted			0
there was no official consultation			0
‘ i quite simply do not know the answer to why she came here			0
who invited her ? why not @entity6 where there are 50million people living in shanty towns ? ‘ she is clearly making a political point by allowing herself to be photographed with people campaigning against the policy			0
‘ i think the @entity2 has got this totally wrong			2
i think she is in trouble with this			0
the general secretary will have to come back with a full response			2
’ controversial policy : the bedroom tax sparked fierce protests in @entity134 back in march this is what @entity27 , the @entity2 's @entity82 on housing , said about the government 's welfare changes : ‘ my immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished			1
' i was very shocked to hear how many people feel abused in their human rights by this decision and why - being so vulnerable - they should pay for the cost of the economic downturn , which was brought about by the financial crisis			1
‘ the right to housing is not about a roof anywhere , at any cost , without any social ties			0
‘ it is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night			0
' it is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds , their local schools , work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights , like education , work , food and health			0
’ but speaking at a press conference today miss @entity27 said she had been alarmed by anecdotal evidence during her factfinding visit to @entity5			2
using the term coined by critics of the measure , rather than the government 's preferred ‘ spare room subsidy ’ tag , she said : ‘ i would suggest that the so - called bedroom tax be suspended immediately and be fully re-evaluated in the light of the evidence of its impact on the right to adequate housing and general well - being of many vulnerable individuals			1
' she went on : ' the right to housing is not about a roof anywhere , at any cost , without any social ties			0
' it is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night			0
' it is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds , their local schools , work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights , like education , work , food and health			0
' miss @entity27 's unprecedented visit has taken in trips to @entity134 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 where she has spoken to people on housing estates and at food banks			1
she claims some tenants were contemplating suicide due to the changes , adding that the welfare reforms could constitute a breach of human rights laws			1
ms @entity27 's final report will be presented in @entity226 to the @entity227 in march			2
she claimed that the country was ‘ going backwards in the protection and promotion of the human right to housing ’			2
ruling : cuts in housing benefit for those who live in larger homes with spare bedrooms is a breach of human rights , according to a @entity2 inspector but a @entity104 spokesman dismissed mrs @entity242 ’s findings , saying : ‘ it is surprising to see these conclusions being drawn from anecdotal evidence and conversations after a handful of meetings – instead of actual hard research and data			1
‘ @entity5 has a very strong housing safety net and even after our necessary reforms we continue to pay over 80 per cent of most claimants ’ rent if they are affected by the ending of the spare room subsidy			0
‘ these changes will help us get to grips with the housing benefit bill which has grown to £ 24billion this year , and make better use of our housing stock			1
' we ’ve given councils £ 190million to support vulnerable residents who may need extra help			0
’ a government source added : ‘ the courts in this country have already ruled that the @entity271 is lawful			2
‘ we are extremely surprised and disappointed that the @entity2 has come here and is directly contradicting the decisions of our courts			2

@entity27 was sent to assess impact of changes to housing benefit
she said that so - called ' @entity271 ' is a breach of human rights
