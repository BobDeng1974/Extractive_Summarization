by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 19:13 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 19:28 est , 11 september 2012 convicted : @entity3 , seen here in a 2005 court appearance , was charged with the murder of his estranged wife but her body was never found a once - prominent auto dealer from @entity10 is urging the state 's top court to overturn his conviction for murdering his missing wife whose body has never been found			1
@entity3 , 51 , said that circumstantial evidence and trial errors lead to his murder sentence after his estranged wife @entity19 , who disappeared on the morning after the september 11th terrorist attacks			1
his defense attorney @entity21 agrees , arguing on principal that motive and intent , without a body , are not enough in this case			0
there 's no body , no murder weapon , and two possibilities about when she was last seen alive			1
co-workers said that they last saw @entity19 leaving her shift as a waitress on the night of september 11 , 2001 , but a farmer came forward as a witness years later saying he had seen a woman resembling @entity38 and a younger man arguing at about 5.30am on september 12 , 2001			1
the district attorney @entity40 argues that in addition to small splotches of blood found in the divorcing family â€™s kitchen , there was also a threat overheard by the victim 's hairdresser			0
now , @entity10 's @entity50 will decide whether @entity51 was fairly convicted of murdering the mother of his four children or presumed guilty based on insufficient circumstantial evidence			0
the seven judges on the state 's top court heard oral arguments tuesday and a ruling is expected next month			0
tense : at the time of @entity19 's ( right ) disappearance , she and @entity3 ( left , seen in 2009 ) were still living together with their four children but there had been talk of divorce two truths undisputed by both prosecutors and defense are that she has n't been seen since september 2001 and no murder weapon was ever found			1
' the logical inferences to be drawn do n't prove beyond reasonable doubt that @entity3 murdered his wife , ' defense attorney @entity21 said			1
he said there 's no viable theory for how @entity3 could have killed her at the house where they both still resided with their children , then disposed of her body within the supposed time frame , less than eight hours , and the limited geography			1
timeline : initially @entity19 's waitressing co-workers said they last saw her on the night of september 11 but a farmer came forward years later saying he saw her arguing with a younger man early the next morning @entity3 called the baby sitter about 7am the next morning , saying his wife had n't come home and he needed help getting the kids ready for the day			1
@entity3 , now 51 , is in @entity93 prison , eligible for parole in 2034			2
he was co-owner of several upstate car dealerships and involved in a fractious divorce			0
his net worth was estimated at about $ 4million , which prosecutors saw as motive			0
they also pointed to evidence of threats			0
@entity104 district attorney @entity40 said he finally decided to prosecute @entity3 in 2005 , no longer hoping investigators would find a body or that @entity3 would make an admission to someone			1
' i thought the evidence was a very good , strong circumstantial case			0
there was good evidence of motive and opportunity and really good blood evidence , ' he said			0
mr @entity40 argued that some small blood spatters in the kitchen entryway and garage floor supported his theory that @entity3 hit his wife with a blunt object , imperfectly cleaned up , and buried her somewhere in the isolated area with thousands of acres of woods and trees			1
the defense argued there was no telling how long her blood had been there and there was very little of it			0
@entity3 ' first conviction in 2007 was vacated after a new witness suddenly turned up , a farmer who said he had seen a woman resembling @entity137 and a younger man arguing at about 5.30am on september 12 , 2001			1
her vehicle had been found parked at the end of their driveway			0
@entity3 was convicted again in 2009 , leading to the appeal			2
gone : investigators gave up looking for the mother - of - four 's body because the family 's house is in ' the middle of nowhere ' surrounded by thousands of acres of woods ' case law used to be until like 1980 , you did have to have a body in order to have a murder prosecution and a valid murder conviction , ' mr @entity40 said			2
that changed in later convictions that were upheld with no body , weapon or confession , including a @entity10 physician whose wife vanished after he flew a rented plane out over the @entity165 and came back , he said			2
mr @entity21 filed an appeal citing legal insufficiency of evidence against @entity3 , and that the trial court made errors including refusing to exclude a juror who admitted having an advance opinion on guilt			2
prior to the case being brought to the state supreme court , a midlevel court split 3 - 1 in affirming the conviction .			0

@entity3 found guilty of killing his wife @entity19 but her body and a murder weapon were never found
she disappeared either the night of september 11th or morning of the 12th
