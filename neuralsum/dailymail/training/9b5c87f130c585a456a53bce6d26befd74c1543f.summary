by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:40 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 24 may 2013 @entity2 is being lined up as a key weapon for the @entity4 in the next general election campaign			1
@entity6 is prepared to turn to the @entity8 mayor to win over voters who are currently put off by the party			2
senior @entity4 say mr @entity2 has agreed to play a leading role as a ‘ frontman ’ in the campaign			1
he is expected to hold solo rallies across the country as well as join mr @entity6 on the trail			2
mr @entity6 has already hired strategist @entity44 , who masterminded mr @entity2 ’s two mayoral election victories , to help run the campaign in 2015			1
a senior @entity48 source said : ‘ @entity6 wants @entity2 to play a big role			1
he knows @entity2 is a real asset – he ’s hugely popular with conservative voters and a real crowd - pleaser			1
@entity2 is a one - off and he ’ll be brilliant at rallying support			1
‘ and @entity2 is very keen to do what he can to help			1
everyone is going to have to play their part if we want to win			0
@entity2 is up for the challenge			2
’ trio : the unusual line - up attended a celebration event for 10 - 14 - year - olds who had taken part in the mayor 's @entity65 actor @entity67 and his son @entity68 at @entity28 with @entity2 , watch a presentation by young @entity70 involved in the mayor 's @entity65 @entity72 : the @entity8 mayor enjoyed sharing the stage with rapper @entity67 workshop : @entity2 , @entity29 and @entity68 took part in some of the activities , including giving advice on staying out of trouble and forming a ' human knot ' a senior @entity81 figure has admitted that the country ’s benefits bill is ‘ unsustainable ’			1
@entity84 , the party ’s work and pensions spokesman , said : ‘ welfare spending went up during the crash			0
that is supposed to happen			0
the problem is that it has not come back down and has carried on rising by 2 per cent a year			0
’ he suggested that @entity81 voters want to see the party get tougher on welfare , adding : ‘ at the moment they do n’t find the system is giving help to the right people and that frustrates them			0
we have to listen to that			0
’ but a @entity48 spokesman said : ‘ it is frankly a joke that @entity84 is saying @entity81 will get tough on welfare – this from the party that hiked welfare spending by 60 per cent while they were in government			0
’ mr @entity2 has proved he can win in the capital where @entity81 still maintains an electoral stranglehold			2
he is also popular with voters in the @entity114 and blue collar communities who mr @entity6 has failed to convince that the party is on their side			0
recent polls have put the @entity4 as low as 24 per cent in the polls , just two points ahead of @entity121			0
insiders also expect mr @entity2 to energise the party ’s grassroots base alienated by mr @entity6 ’s support for gay marriage			2
while the @entity8 mayor himself also backs gay marriage , he is seen as a ‘ feel - good figure ’ by the party who will inspire a mass turnout from the shires where mr @entity6 has triggered defections to @entity121			0
that common touch was on display yesterday , when mr @entity2 met @entity139 actor and pop star @entity67 and son @entity68 at @entity28 for the mayor ’s @entity65 , which offer extracurricular activities for 10 - to 14 - year - olds			1
knot : in bizarre scenes one workshop involved the schoolchildren forming a ' human knot ' with the @entity140 and @entity139 actor support : the @entity65 help young people through the tough move from primary to secondary school revealing to mr @entity25 that he had written his own rap song he said : ‘ my first rap , i have n’t really set it to music yet			1
it was about the @entity161			0
’ mr @entity25 joked in reply : ‘ that was big in the hip - hop community			1
’ while both sides claim relations between mr @entity6 and mr @entity2 are good , the latter has recently made it clear that he does covet the @entity48 leadership and no 10 officials often struggle to hide their irritation when he speaks out against government policy			2
despite this , the prime minister ’s senior advisers have convinced him he should call ‘ all hands to the pump ’ if he wants to keep @entity176 out of @entity177 .			0
