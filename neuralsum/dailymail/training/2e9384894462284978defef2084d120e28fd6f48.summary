@entity0 decided to squeeze a spot on his back that had been there for 20 years , after it became red , sore and covered in whiteheads this is the revolting moment a man squeezes a spot on the back of his neck for the first time in 20 years			1
not for the squeamish , the video shows a torrent of white pus that had been blocked under the skin for two decades before being released			1
however the @entity17 man it belongs claims the process was not painful - and actually relieved the pressure in the spot			1
going under the pseudonym of @entity0 , he told @entity23 the spot finally became problematic while he and his wife were travelling through @entity26 , in south - east @entity27			1
he said : ' the lump started to grow and it got to the point that it hurt for me just to tilt my head back because of all the pressure			1
' but we were in @entity26 , so we were quite apprehensive about going to any medical clinic - especially since we likely would n't be able to communicate with anyone			2
' then the lump started to form white - heads			2
many , many white - heads			0
' our frantic online research had us more or less convinced that this was basically a gigantic zit			0
' we realised we needed to get this thing to " release "			0
' desperate to get rid of the pain , he asked wife to direct his hands where to squeeze , and she decided filmed the event so he could see it			1
mr @entity0 explained : ' we got some gauze and alcohol and band - aids - a random assortment of normal first - aid stuff			0
the video , which mr @entity0 uploaded to @entity52 , shows a painful looking open wound at the centre of a big lump , with red and inflamed skin surrounding it			1
as his wife has just unblocked the pore with a pin , at first only clear liquid and blood is seen dripping out			1
' at first , my wife used a pin to start a hole , ' he explained			1
' initially just a narrow stream of " stuff " came out , but the lump did n't really get any smaller			0
' then , some of the multiple white - heads started to release			0
' mr @entity0 squeezes with his fingers and a small amount of white pus becomes visible , coming through from two whiteheads			1
as he applies more pressure , reams of white pus come shooting out suddenly , mixed with blood and oil			2
after a long chain of pus is released , it seemed there was no more			0
click below for video - warning graphic content appearing on the @entity85 show recently , dr @entity84 said the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it			1
' the best way to pop a spot is to rip upwards ' instead , he advises using a needle cleaned with alcohol			1
this should be placed parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin from one side to another			0
' then , rip up , ' dr @entity84 advises			0
' you only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead , ' he said			0
here , there is no sensation , but if you jab the needle in front ways , you will soon hit a part of the spot that is n't dead - and that will hurt			2
the parallel technique also wo n't cause any damage to the surrounding , healthy skin , he said			0
but an extra squeeze pushed out another snake - like amount of the white stuff , which curls into a sticky ball			0
mr @entity0 , from @entity124 , @entity17 , was left with a pea - sized amount of white pus , attached to his spot			1
pus in a white head is formed of oil , dead cells , and bacteria			0
whiteheads form when the pores of the skin become clogged with oil and dead skin cells , forming a ' lid '			2
the pore 's oil secretions build up behind the blockage			0
bacteria that live in the pore feed of the secretions and grow , stimulating the body to send immune cells			2
this is why the area around the spot is red and inflamed , as the immune system tries to kill the bacteria and heal the tissue			1
mr @entity0 said the act of squeezing released pressure which made the lump less painful			2
‘ i definitely felt the pressure go way down , and it felt way better , ’ he said			2
‘ and it did n't hurt while i was popping it - it just felt like pressure releasing			2
‘ once a significant amount of stuff had come out , it felt way better , and soon stopped hurting altogether			0
’ he added that he and his wife carried out these spot - squeezing sessions two or three times a day for nearly a week – draining more pus each time			1
‘ each time stuff would come out			0
sometimes a lot - like a lot , ’ he said			0
although he still has the lump , it is barely noticeable now , he added			0
mr @entity0 asked his wife to unblock the pore with a pin , and as he squeezed white pus slowly came out more and more white pus was ejected as he applied pressure , and eventually a long chain of the substance was ejected , which curled into a ball mr @entity0 was left with a pea - sized amount of pus on his face			1
he said he and his wife squeezed the spot two or three times a day for a nearly a week - draining more pus each time			1
