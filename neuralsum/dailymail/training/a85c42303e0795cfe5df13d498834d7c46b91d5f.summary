@entity2 , 57 , abused his position of trust while working as a treasurer for his local evangelical church and an international relief charity			1
he fiddled the accounts of @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , where he had been a member for 16 years , as well as the @entity17 to steal a total of £ 517,000 over a six - year period			1
his dishonesty was only discovered when @entity21 , the church ’s senior pastor and his personal friend , noticed irregularities while carrying out a financial assessment and called the police			2
officers discovered @entity29 ’s gift aid claims were substantially in excess of the actual donations made and he often added an extra zero to the figure			2
he was jailed for five years at @entity33 after pleading guilty to 12 charges of false accounting at a hearing earlier this year and four offences of cheating @entity38			1
sentencing him , judge @entity39 branded @entity29 ' despicable ' for stealing cash intended for charities , including to help hungry orphans			2
he told him : ' we are all familiar with employees who steal from employers but when the victim is a charitable trust the consequences are far greater			0
' a total of £ 118,000 had been raised by the @entity17 to help struggling children in the @entity51 in a desperate state of poverty			1
' you used the cash to prop up your ailing accountancy business			0
people in this country were generous when they made donations to charity			0
' when they find out that instead of going to a good cause the money has gone into the pocket of a dishonest accountant it severely tests their attitude			0
' @entity29 , 57 , fiddled the accounts while treasurer at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , where he had been a member for 16 years the court heard @entity2 pocketed £ 195,000 after making false gift aid repayments and siphoned off a further £ 205,000 from the church			1
he also trousered £ 117,000 from a charity called the @entity17 which helped children ’s orphanages in the @entity51			1
@entity75 , prosecuting , told the court : ' he was simply paying out the money from the church bank account into his own coffers through a variety of different routes			0

he manoeuvred himself into the position where he had sole control of large sums of money			0
' @entity38 investigator the court heard trustees of the charities feared they would lose their homes if the inland revenue pursued the stolen money but had taken a ' compassionate view ' and opted not to try and claw the cash back			1

' this did not satisfy him or provide any sense of loyalty			0
the @entity126 scheme is designed to benefit charities , but @entity29 continued to falsify business records for his own financial benefit			0
' the prison sentence handed out by the courts today sends out a clear message that crime does not pay and the community will be horrified to learn he exploited and stole from these charities and the taxpayer , in a sustained and methodical way , over a number of years			2
