kissed and fondled : @entity0 claimed she was shamefully molested by @entity1 in 2012 just five months before he was first arrested , the writing was on the wall for @entity1			1
the @entity5 published a graphic account by journalist @entity0 of how he shamelessly molested her in front of his wife			1
the columnist asked for an interview because he was about to meet the @entity13 opposition leader @entity12			1
but she was left giggling ‘ out of horror and fear ’ during an unforgettable exchange in which the then 67 - year - old entertainer took every opportunity to touch her			1
‘ i spent 90 minutes with the former radio 1 dj @entity1 and i do n’t think there is a part of my body that he did n’t grope , ’ the resulting article began			2
‘ he fondled my foot , inched his hands up my thighs , tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me			2
‘ he copped a feel of my hips when i foolishly asked for a tour of his studio , stroked my chin and my back and gave me a full body hug as i left			1
’ when police went public on their investigation , they asked miss @entity0 if she would support a prosecution or give evidence but she declined			1
speaking last night after he was convicted , she said : ‘ he did n’t worry about getting consent too much , he just did it			0
’ that damning june 2012 interview took place more than four decades after @entity1 first rose to fame as a @entity21 and @entity48 presenter			0
but it lays bare exactly how a bearded pipe - smoking hippy believed he had the right to behave exactly as he pleased in the company of women			2
in court , @entity1 described himself as having a ‘ cuddly nature ’ and happily admitted to loving ‘ wonderful ’ women who have ‘ fabulous shapes ’			0
‘ if i like someone i will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that , ’ he told the jury benignly			0
he declared that ‘ half the country would be in jail ’ if patting a woman ’s bottom was a crime in the 1970s as he dismissed his accusers as ‘ fantasists ’			0
in reality , his sexually - charged advances were unwanted and investigators suspect there are many more victims who have not come forward			2
in fact , it was @entity1 ’s own bravado which helped secure his place in the dock , for not one but two criminal trials			0
the day after his arrest , the dj could not resist coming out of his prized @entity86 bungalow to face the tv cameras and proclaim his innocence			1
he had only been accused of ‘ squeezing the boobs of a couple of women ’ , he protested			0
but the sight of @entity1 , puffed up with self - righteousness and labelling himself an ‘ easy target ’ , prompted another flurry of women to contact police			1
the then 67 - year - old entertainer took every opportunity to touch miss @entity0 , including her feet and thighs @entity1 on the @entity101 show in 1995 : it was behind the scenes of this appearance that @entity1 was found by a jury to have groped the breasts of young researcher , who is now a broadcaster herself the majority of those went to trial in february but he was cleared on 12 counts			1
the jury was unable to decide on two counts which were the subject of the most recent trial plus the case of a researcher for the @entity101 show			0
he was found guilty of assaulting the researcher but cleared on both the other cases			1
while playing @entity123 ’s evil uncle in a pantomime , @entity1 was accused of ‘ engulfing ’ a stage hand in his costume cloak and forcing his hand down her tracksuit bottoms			0
the allegation resulted in @entity131 – his co-stars in the 1990 panto at a theatre in @entity135 , @entity136 – coming to court in his defence			0
they were said to have unwittingly saved the young woman from his clutches by interrupting the assault in his dressing room			2
the stage hand claimed @entity1 pinned her to the door and groped her ‘ from top to toe ’ as he towered over her			0
she told jurors he then forced his hand down her tracksuit bottoms and into her knickers – only stopping when one of the slapstick comedians – aka @entity150 and @entity152 - was heard saying ‘ all right @entity1 ’			2
assistant theatre manager @entity153 told the court that @entity1 had such a ‘ threatening presence ’ that girls on the early 1990s production agreed that none would be left alone with him			2
mr @entity153 added : ‘ he would come up behind them and put the cloak around them			0
’ but the @entity131 , now in their 60s , came to court to defend @entity1 , saying he was a ‘ jolly great chap to work with ’ and that they could not remember any such incident			0
the dj pictured left outside his home near @entity166 in @entity167 after the claims emerged in 2012 and right , in his heyday as a presenter on @entity171 in the 1960s the jurors rejected the woman ’s claims and found @entity1 not guilty			1
the @entity21 was also accused of groping the breasts of a journalist who was interviewing him as his wife slept upstairs			0
the former @entity171 @entity21 invited the 24 - year - old feature writer to his luxury home in 2008 to reminisce about a @entity181 with stars including @entity183 and @entity184 , for a nostalgia feature			1
he allegedly told the young interviewer she had a good figure and asked if she would like to pose for a semi-naked photograph for him			2
he is pictured leaving @entity189 with his wife @entity190 after he was found guilty of groping a female tv personality yesterday she claimed he pawed at her cleavage before cocking his head to one side , as if he was judging the size of her breasts			1
the former @entity48 presenter denied her claims , telling jurors the women had been lying , but she told them it was true and she would stake her life on it			0
her claims have been tested by juries in two separate trials , and both were unable to agree – meaning @entity1 was formally found not guilty of the charge .			1
