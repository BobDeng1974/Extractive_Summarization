by @entity0 and @entity1 eggs belonging to an ancient flying reptile that could grow to the size of a small aircraft have been discovered in @entity6			1
it is the first time eggs laid by a pterosaur have been found fully intact , and palaeontologists claim they could shed new light on a mysterious , previously unknown species			1
the fossils were discovered in the @entity14 , and suggest that at least some of the animals lived in large nesting colonies , much like modern birds			1
discovered : palaeontologists have found eggs laid by a pterosaur for the first time and they say that the discovery could shed new light on the mysterious ancient reptiles the previously unknown pterosaur species , @entity25 , is thought to have had a wingspan of between five and 11 feet			1
the @entity28 eggs were not soft and leathery , such as those of most reptiles , nor were they hard like a bird ’s			2
instead they had a thin pliable shell overlaying a thick membrane			0
the modern rat snake lays a similar type of egg , according to the scientists			0
a total of five intact fossil eggs were found at the site in @entity14 in north west @entity6 , along with the bones of 40 adults			1
they all belong to a previously unknown pterosaur species named @entity25 , which had a wingspan of between 5ft ( 1.5 metres ) and 11ft ( 3.4 metres )			1
scientists believe the thin - shelled eggs , which show signs of cracking and crazing , were not part of the same clutch			2
‘ the combination of many pterosaurs and eggs indicates the presence of a nesting site nearby and suggests that this species developed gregarious behaviour , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity55 , from the @entity56 in @entity57			1
‘ @entity65 likely made its nesting grounds on the shores of freshwater lakes or rivers and buried its eggs in sand along the shore , preventing them from being desiccated			2
’ previously the only pterosaur eggs known to science were four poorly preserved and flattened specimens , three of which were discovered in @entity6 , and one @entity77			1
the fossils were found in @entity6 and suggest that at least some of the creatures lived in large nesting colonies , much like modern birds			1
' @entity65 likely made its nesting grounds on the shores of freshwater lakes or rivers ( illustrated ) and buried its eggs in sand along the shore ' the experts said based on skulls recovered , experts think that the ancient reptiles had head crests ( illustrated ) which differed in size and shape between the sexes the @entity28 eggs were not soft and leathery like those of most reptiles , nor were they hard like a bird ’s			1
instead they had a thin pliable shell overlaying a thick membrane , according to the study published in the journal @entity105			0
the modern rat snake lays a similar type of egg , the scientists explained			0
‘ we regard the eggshell structure found in @entity111 as a general trend for pterosaurs , ’ they said			0
the pterosaurs are thought to have died in a large storm that hit their colony in the @entity117 , south of the @entity118 , around 120 million years ago			2
male and female skulls were recovered as well as vertebrae and limbs			0
both sexes of the reptile had head crests , but the males ’ were larger and a different shape than the females ’			0
they palaeontologists said : ‘ sites like the one reported here provide further evidence regarding the behaviour and biology of this amazing group of flying reptiles that has no parallel in modern time			0
’ pterosaurs are often confused with dinosaurs but belonged to a distinct reptilian group			0
much less is known about them than the dinosaurs			0
they were the first vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight and showed enormous diversity			0
species ranged from creatures the size of a sparrow to the monstrous @entity152 , which had a wingspan of 40ft ( 12 metres )			2
towards the end of their time on @entity156 , only the larger species remained as the smaller ones were out - competed by early birds .			2

the five fossil eggs were found in @entity14 , north west @entity6
all belonged to an unknown pterosaur species - @entity28 *tianshanensis*
this species is thought to have had a wingspan of between five and 11ft
the find suggests at least some of the creatures lived in large nesting colonies , much like modern birds
previously , the only pterosaur eggs found were four poorly preserved and flattened specimens
