on the shoreline of @entity3 's most famous beach , a decaying swimming pool attracts little attention from wandering tourists			1
a few glance curiously at the crumbling @entity7 , a salt water pool built in 1927 as a memorial to the 10,000 soldiers from @entity3 who served in @entity12 but the monument 's walls are caked with salt and rust , and passers - by are quickly diverted by the lure of sand and waves			1
the faded structure has been closed to the public for decades , the object of seemingly endless debate over whether it should be demolished or restored to its former glory			1
the latest plan is to replace it with a beach , more practical for the state 's lucrative tourism industry - and millions of dollars cheaper , according to state and local officials			1
they say a full restoration could cost nearly $ 70 million			0
closed : the locked gates of the faded @entity7 which has been closed to the public since 1979 the corroding monument has challenged the community to maneuver a delicate question : how do we honor those who have served when memorials deteriorate and finances are tight ? similar debates have been playing out across the country			1
the @entity47 waged a two - and - a - half - year fight to restore the aging @entity49 in @entity50 in @entity51 , when some people proposed replacing it			2
far less disagreement surrounded a decision to update the @entity56 in @entity57 after a powerful earthquake in 1989			0
in @entity61 , @entity60 residents have been grappling with what to do with the city 's own decaying tribute to the soldiers of @entity12 former glory : the @entity67 in @entity60 hosted minor league baseball for decades and served as a location for notable sports films such as ' leatherheads ' but is now falling into disrepair the @entity67 hosted minor league baseball for decades and even served as a location for notable sports films such as " leatherheads " and " @entity76			1
" yet , despite continued use by kids and college - level athletes , the structure is falling into disrepair			1
the historic pebbled facade is falling off , and some of the bleachers are blocked off because of crumbling concrete , said @entity86 , a @entity61 resident who is fighting as a member of his neighborhood association to restore the structure			2
it 's been a losing battle			2
the city rejected two referendums to fund renovations and chose to build a new stadium for minor league baseball instead of fixing up the old one			0
as a classics professor at @entity99 , @entity86 has a soft spot for historic places			0
but he recognizes there are many other priorities competing for the millions of dollars it would take to restore the stadium			0
a city group is exploring different ways to use the space , and preservation advocates hope the monument can be saved even if that means changing the stadium 's purpose			2
for many residents , the structure 's architectural and historic significance pales in comparison to more immediate needs			2
' the war was a long time ago , ' @entity86 said			2
' i do n't think it 's meaningful for most people			2
' sometimes , communities decide that memorials are n't worth the price			1
pre-loved : despite continued use by kids and college - level athletes , officials opted not to renovate the @entity67 in @entity61 , @entity60 and built a new stadium instead in @entity132 's upper peninsula , the @entity130 once stood as a grand structure overlooking a lake in @entity135 , an old mining town			1
the memorial , built in 1924 to commemorate the sacrifices of @entity12 soldiers , was expansive , including a banquet hall , meeting room and theater			1
by the 1950s , the community could n't afford the upkeep of the building and sold it to a private owner			0
over the years , there were attempts to renovate the structure			0
but it was deemed too expensive and by 2010 , the building was demolished			0
@entity152 , the city manager , said there are plans to build a new memorial at the site , including a @entity157 and library			2
demolished : @entity130 in @entity132 , seen here in 2009 , was built in 1924 to commemorate the sacrifices of @entity12 soldiers but proved too expensive to maintain and was torn down in 2010 but the project is on hold , and @entity152 said he 's not sure when construction will start or when the project will pick up again			1
the lot where the building used to stand is now an empty lawn			0
the snow melted just last week , remnants of a long winter			0
in @entity172 , the fight over the beachside memorial is far from over			0
@entity173 , who manages the beaches and parks in @entity7 , says the salty air , crashing waves and decades - old construction material have contributed to the memorial 's demise			1
' unfortunately this may have had its day in the sun , ' @entity173 said			0
' it 's a world war i memorial but quite frankly , it looks like it 's been through war			1
' crumbling : honolulu mayor @entity188 believes it 's more respectful to the memory of soldiers who served in @entity12 to demolish the decaying @entity7 than to let it crumble into the sea @entity3 state and local officials recently announced a proposal to tear down the building and have started analyzing the plan - a process expected to take at least a year			1
honolulu mayor @entity188 says the demolition has been a long time coming			0
' the greater disrespect is allowing the pool to continue to crumble and fall into the sea , ' @entity188 said			0
@entity188 says the new beach would better serve local residents and plans to preserve the memorial 's arch will honor the soldiers			1
demolishing the structure for $ 18 million is much cheaper than the $ 69 million price tag attached to full renovation , he said			0
but an organization called @entity213 says the city 's cost analysis is wrong and renovation would in fact be cheaper than demolition			0
the group , led by former state lawmaker @entity219 , wants a moratorium on any plans to destroy the memorial to give the group time to fund - raise for restoration danger : the once - great swimming pool was built as a @entity227 , but is now infested with sharks as authorities argue over its future @entity219 says because the building is on the @entity232 , a restoration campaign could attract philanthropy from across the nation			1
but he acknowledges that it could be hard to garner public support			0
@entity12 does n't carry the same significance in @entity3 as @entity239 , and many people like the idea of a new beach			1
the site is such a safety hazard that public access has been blocked since 1979 - well past the pool 's days of hosting legendary athletes like @entity249 swimmer and surf icon @entity250			1
crabs scuttle between ' danger ' signs lining the building 's edges , and sharks swim in the pool , beneath the cracks of the crumbling floor			2
' we 're a nation of short memory , ' @entity219 said .			0

@entity3 's @entity7 pool was built in 1927 as a memorial to the 10,000 @entity3 soldiers who served in @entity12
the gates have been closed to the public since 1979
the state is considering replacing the pool with a beach but *critics* dismiss the idea as disrespectful to those who served
many other structures dedicated to the memory of fallen soldiers across the country are falling into disrepair
communities are grappling with the question of how to maintain war memorials on a tight *budget*
