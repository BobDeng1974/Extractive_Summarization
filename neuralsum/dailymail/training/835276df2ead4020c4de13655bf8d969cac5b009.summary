by @entity0 last updated at 9:54 pm on 12th october 2011 sporadic outages of @entity3 messaging and email today spread to the @entity5 and @entity6 - as problems with the smartphone stretched into the third day for @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity5 users were reporting that their @entity14 were n't getting email on wednesday morning , as widespread problems added to the woes of @entity6 manufacturer @entity17			1
@entity17 yesterday admitted a crucial link in its infrastructure had failed - and a backup did n't work either - with the under - fire company now working as quickly as it can to get through a backlog of traffic			1
issues : @entity5 users were reporting that their @entity14 were n't getting email on wednesday morning , as widespread problems added to the woes of @entity6 manufacturer @entity17 this is n't the first time @entity17 has suffered messaging outages with @entity3			1
its @entity30 service went offline in @entity6 and @entity11 last month and a massive disruption hit @entity32 in 2007			1
but these disruptions are usually contained within one continent or region - whereas in the latest outage they have hit four continents			2
@entity17 has not yet said when the outage will be fully resolved or how many people are affected			1
the firm is suffering from slowing sales and a tablet that has been a dud , while its shares are approaching a five - year low			2
but there are still about 70 million @entity3 users around the world			2
analysts now estimate that up to half of them may be affected			0
‘ the resolution of this service issue is our number one priority right now and we are working night and day to restore all @entity3 services to normal levels , ’ the company said today			1
in the @entity58 , the two biggest phone companies said they would compensate their @entity3 users for the mishap by giving them at least three days of free service			0
@entity62 , chief marketing officer for @entity63 , the country 's biggest telecom , said it was acting in response to the ' exceptional and unprecedented circumstances '			0
fix required : a @entity3 sign stands outside offices of @entity17 in @entity71			1
sporadic outages of @entity3 messaging and email service today spread from @entity9 to the @entity5 and @entity6 unlike other mobile phone makers , @entity17 handles email and messaging traffic to and from its phones , so when it encounters a problem , millions of subscribers are affected at once			1
attempts to solve the problem are focusing on a ‘ core switch ’ failure at @entity3 ’s data centre in @entity86 , @entity87			0
the core switch is the backbone of the service			0
it operates like a hi - tech postal sorting office , receiving millions of emails and messages every minute and directing them to the correct recipient			2
when it fails , a back - up system should kick in , but that did not happen			1
with every hour , a huge backlog of data builds up - and that is causing the company huge problems			1
one of the big attractions of the @entity3 for overseas users is the @entity30 , or @entity30 , which works like text messaging but does n't incur extra fees			0
but @entity109 was affected by the outage			0
the problems could not have come at a worse time for @entity17 as @entity113 is today releasing software for its iphones that works like @entity30			1
@entity113 is one of the chief causes of @entity17 's diminishing fortunes			1
veteran @entity87 entrepreneur @entity119 , who founded electronics company @entity121 in 1968 , said he has never seen anything like it			2
‘ in all my years in it biz , i have never seen such an outage as experienced by @entity3 , ’ @entity119 tweeted			0
‘ i ca n't understand why it 's taking so long to fix			0
’ former political spin doctor @entity127 added : ' some free advice			0
' ' in all my years in it biz , i have never seen such an outage as experienced by @entity3			0
i ca n't understand why it 's taking so long to fix ' veteran @entity87 entrepreneur @entity119 @entity17 shares fell $ 0.46 , or 1.9 per cent , to $ 23.95 in morning trading in @entity138			2
one joke making the rounds on @entity141 said : ‘ what did the one @entity30 user say to the other ? nothing			0
’ @entity146 , technology editor of @entity87 magazine which , said : ' @entity3 should be doing more to keep customers informed about the ongoing problems with its service			2
' in some cases , customers have heard about the issue from their mobile network provider but have heard nothing from @entity3 itself			0
that 's not great customer service			0
