an ancient relationship between fins and fingers has been discovered by palaeontologists			1
the experts claim to have unravelled the evolutionary changes needed for ancient lobe - finned fish to turn underwater pectoral fins into strong , bony structures			1
until now , scientists were unsure exactly how this happened , but the latest research shows that certain species of fish have the genes needed to turn fins into wrists , fingers , ankles and toes			1
by studying the genes of a fish called the spotted gar , scientists have discovered genetic ' switches ' ( shown in green ) in transgenic fish fins , meaning it has the potential to evolve into fingers and wrists			1
this image shows a view of a transgenic zebrafish pectoral fish fin with cell nuclei in blue and gene activity in green ‘ fossils show that the wrist and digits clearly have an aquatic origin , ' said dr @entity40 of the @entity41			2
' but fins and limbs have different purposes			2
scientists wanted to study how the extinct @entity47 roseae lead to tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl in water or on land			1
they began by attempting to compare the shape of fins and limb bones , but these tests proved unsuccessful			0
they then put the genes of a fish known as the spotted gar into developing mice			1
these genes , which control how the gar develops its fins , were found to cause patterns of activity that were ' nearly indistinguishable from those driven by the mouse genome '			2
put simply , they discovered that the tiny radial bones in bony fish fins , and the fingers or toes of tetrapods are remarkably similar			1
and it was the presence and evolution of this type of gene that led the fins to turn into fingers			1
‘ they have evolved in different directions since they diverged			0
' we wanted to explore , and better understand , their connections by adding genetic and molecular data to what we already know from the fossil record			0
’ in particular , the scientists wanted to study how the extinct @entity47 enabled emerging tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl in shallow water or on land			1
the @entity47 rosae was a lobe - finned fish that lived in the late @entity96 period , but had features similar to four - legged animals			1
they began by attempting to compare the shape of fins and limb bones , but these tests proved unsuccessful			0
a limb is split into three sections - stylopod , zeugopod , and autopod			0
a stylopod , for example , contains the humerus and femur , the zeugopod is the ulna and radius , and the autopod contains the wrist and fingers			0
prehistoric fish , such as the @entity47 ( fossil pictured ) , whose fins were strong , bony structures , led to the evolution of emerging emerging tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl in shallow water or on land , but until now , experts have been unsure how this happened @entity129 experts have found that a freshwater fish called the spotted gar ( stock image ) , has the basic genetics to evolve an autopod , comprising wrists and fingers or ankles and toes the @entity47 rosae was a lobe - finned fish that lived in the late @entity96 period , but had features similar to four - legged animals			1
a tiktaalik roseae fossil was discovered in 2004			0
it represents the best - known transitional species between fish and land - dwelling tetrapods			1
a fish with a broad flat head and sharp teeth , @entity47 looked like a cross between a fish and a crocodile			1
it had gills , scales and fins , but also had tetrapod - like features such as a mobile neck , robust ribcage and primitive lungs			2
in particular , its large forefins had shoulders , elbows and partial wrists , which allowed it to support itself on ground			0
the autopod differs to most fins because the wrist is composed of a series of small nodular bones , followed by longer thin bones			0
in contrast , the bones that make up the fins of modern fish look different , with a set of longer bones ending in small circular bones called radials			2
the primary genes that shape the bones are known as the @entity184 and @entity185 clusters , and these also differ between limbs and fins , according to the study in the journal , @entity191 ( @entity191 )			1
the researchers first tested the ability of genetic switches that control the genes in teleosts - a type of fish - to shape the limbs of developing mice			1
they found that the fish control switches did not trigger any activity in the autopod , or mouse in general			0
after deciding that teleost fish were not suitable for the study , they inserted genes from the gar fish into developing mice instead			1
this time , the researchers discovered that the gar switches caused patterns of activity that were ' nearly indistinguishable from those driven by the mouse genome '			0
the autopod - building genetic switches from gar are able to drive gene activity ( shown in purple ) in the digits of transgenic mice - an activity that was not spotted in any other fish groups studied in january , the same group of researchers announced that the evolution of hind legs began as enhanced fins			1
they studied the fossil of the @entity47 ( illustrated ) which is thought was able to ' walk ' and support itself on the ground with the aid of extra functional , strong ' fins ' in january , researchers found that the evolution of hind legs began as enhanced fins			1
they discovered a well - preserved pelvis and fin from a 375 million - year - old fossil of the @entity47			2
the find challenged the theory that large , mobile hind appendages were developed only after vertebrates transitioned to land			0
previous theories , based on the best available data , propose that a shift occurred from " front - wheel drive " locomotion in fish to more of a " four - wheel drive " in tetrapods			2
but experts now claim this shift actually began to happen in fish , not in limbed animals			2
for example , the team discovered the @entity47 's pelvic girdle was nearly identical in size to its shoulder girdle			2
it had a prominent ball and socket hip joint , which connected to a highly mobile femur			0
crests on the hip for muscle attachment indicated strength and advanced fin function			0
and although no femur bone was found , pelvic fin material - including long fin rays - indicate the hind fin was at least as long as its forefin			0
more than 300 million years ago , after fish - like creatures that would become tetrapods split off from other bony fish , a common ancestor of the teleost lineage went through a whole - genome duplication ( @entity281 ) - a phenomenon that has occurred multiple times in evolution			2
by doubling the entire genetic repertoire of teleost fish , this @entity281 phenomenon provided the creatures with enormous diversification potential			0
experts think this helped teleosts to adapt , over time , to a variety of environments across the globe			0
graduate student @entity296 , who led the study , explained : ‘ in the process , the genetic switches that control autopod - building genes were able to drift and shuffle , allowing them to change some of their function , as well as making them harder to identify in comparisons to other animals , such as mice			1
‘ not all bony fishes went through the whole genome duplication , however , ’ he said			0
‘ the spotted gar , a primitive freshwater fish native to @entity312 , split off from teleost fishes before the @entity281			0
’ when the scientists compared @entity185 gene switches from the spotted gar with tetrapods , they found ‘ an unprecedented level of ‘ deep conservation of the vertebrate autopod regulatory apparatus			0
’ put simply , they discovered that the tiny radial bones in bony fish fins , and the fingers or toes of tetrapods are remarkably similar			1
mr @entity296 said : ‘ overall , our results provide regulatory support for an ancient origin of the " late " phase of @entity185 expression that is responsible for building the autopod			0

prehistoric fish , such as the @entity47 , whose fins were strong , led to emerging tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl onto land
until now , scientists have been unsure exactly how this happened
research shows certain fish have the genes needed to turn fins into wrists , fingers , ankles and toes
they tracked how these fish genes changed how mice grew limbs
