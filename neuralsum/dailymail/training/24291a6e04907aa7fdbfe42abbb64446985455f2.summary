a ' fierce military campaign ' was also under way in the @entity65 district of @entity59 since the early hours of friday , according to the @entity67 - based @entity66 and other activists			2
however , the rebel surge has caused a spike in deaths that has claimed the lives of women and children as well as soldiers			2

the @entity5 uprising , which began last march with mostly peaceful protests , has become increasingly violent in recent months as army defectors clash with government forces and some protesters take up arms to protect themselves			1
the violence has inflamed the sectarian divide in the country , where members of @entity9 's @entity131 sect dominate the regime despite a @entity134 majority			2

elsewhere , a car bomb exploded at a checkpoint outside the northern city of @entity60 , the @entity67 - based @entity66 said , quoting witnesses on the ground			0
in an attempt to stop the bloodshed , the @entity156 was to hold a closed - door meeting to discuss the crisis , a step toward a possible resolution against the @entity7 regime			0
the @entity156 says at least 5,400 people have been killed in the government crackdown since march , and the turmoil has intensified as dissident soldiers have joined the ranks of the @entity170 protesters			0
@entity156 rights chief @entity173 , speaking at the @entity171 in @entity172 , expressed ' great concern that the killings are continuing and in my view it 's the authorities who are killing civilians , and so it would all stop if an order comes from the top to stop the killings '			0
@entity9 's regime claims terrorists acting out a foreign conspiracy are behind the uprising			0
international pressure on @entity7 to end the bloodshed so far has produced few results			0
the @entity52 has sent observers to the country , but the mission has been widely criticised for failing to stop the violence			1
@entity195 led by @entity196 pulled out of the mission			1
the @entity156 has been unable to agree on a resolution since violence began in march because of strong opposition from @entity138 and @entity200			0
@entity138 's @entity156 ambassador @entity201 said that the text introduced by new @entity205 security council member @entity203 has ' red lines ' for @entity207 , but he 's willing to ' engage ' with the resolution 's sponsors			0
anti-russian sentiment is running high among rebel fighters because they believe @entity137 's government is preventing regime change in @entity5 , reviving @entity9 , as pictured in this creative protest banner @entity201 said those lines include any indication of sanctions , including an arms embargo			1
' we need to concentrate on establishing political dialogue , ' he said			0
@entity138 's discomfort with the wording of the resolution could be resolved if the document clearly rules out military intervention , said @entity226 , editor of the journal @entity138 in @entity228			0
but he said @entity230 and @entity205 states were unlikely to dismiss the use of force entirely , which will not satisfy @entity207			0
with @entity205 states such as @entity196 and @entity234 determined to get @entity9 out of power and @entity138 opposed , he said , ' i can not really see some resolution that could be agreed by all			0
' this is not @entity240 , it 's a completely different situation			0

the @entity52 halted its observer mission to @entity5 because it has become too *dangerous*
