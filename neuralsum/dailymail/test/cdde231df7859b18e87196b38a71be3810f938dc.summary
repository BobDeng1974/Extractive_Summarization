the draw for the @entity1 has pitted @entity3 's @entity2 against his former club @entity4 , while handing @entity6 champions a daunting task against holders @entity8			1
with sub-plots aplenty , and quality assured , the final four of @entity11 's premier competition will all feel they have a real chance of adding to their @entity11 titles			2
@entity17 's reporters look at each side 's reasons for optimism , and caution , ahead of the semi-finals ... @entity2 by @entity23 reasons they can win the @entity1 … @entity2 have an excellent @entity1 pedigree , with a coach in @entity3 who won this competition twice at @entity4 and a squad that has retained its best players since beating @entity31 in the final at @entity33 two years ago			1
so do @entity4 and @entity8 but , unlike their main rivals , @entity2 can focus largely on @entity35 thanks to a 12 - point lead over @entity37 in the @entity38 and the minor inconvenience of a @entity40 semi-final against @entity31			1
@entity3 can also expect to call on key players like @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 who did not appear in either of the quarter - final legs against @entity47			1
@entity48 issues instructions to his players during a supremely impressive performance against @entity47 @entity3 must now work out how to prevent his side 's old vulnerabilities returning against @entity4 reasons they ca n’t … usually so dominant , there is a peculiar vulnerability about @entity2 under @entity3			1
it was painfully evident in their 5 - 0 aggregate defeat by @entity8 in the semi-finals a year ago , and again in the 3 - 1 loss to @entity47 earlier this month before they turned it around in the second leg in stunning fashion			1
@entity67 can not afford to be off their game against @entity4			2
no - one knows @entity3 ’s game - plan better than his old club			1
he will have to overcome them - and then possibly real - if he wants to win the @entity1 again			2
@entity2 were brilliant in @entity67 , but a repeat of their @entity47 horror - show could see them dumped out @entity8 by @entity76 reasons they can win the @entity1 … there ’s a sense that the worst has past			1
they did not want @entity82 in the quarter - finals having failed to beat them already six times this season			0
then when @entity88 worked his miracles in the first leg and the injuries and suspensions mounted up in the second , the task looked even tougher but they came through			0
@entity95 was vindicated for pitching @entity96 into his forward line and moving @entity98 into midfield			0
with the coach in a strong position and the squad behind him they can do it			0
@entity8 will feel like they have got over their biggest hurdle after their late win over @entity82 reasons they ca n’t … no one player is more important to @entity8 than @entity109			1
they can cope without @entity111 if @entity112 is playing and they can cope without @entity112 if @entity111 is playing — they won the @entity115 last year that way			0
but @entity111 ’s former @entity118 team - mate has no real replacement			0
@entity82 were poor on wednesday night and so the @entity120 was not missed too much but against @entity122 his absence will be felt			2
he could be back for the final but they may not get there without him			0
the injury to @entity109 is the single biggest obstacle standing in @entity95 's way to retaining the title juventus by @entity132 reasons they can win the @entity1 ... the travel advice to anyone planing to watch @entity122 in the semi-final is to take a good book			1
@entity140 ’s team are living proof that the art of defending @entity6 - style is alive and well after keeping nine clean sheets in their last 10 matches			0
that three - man defence , comprising @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , loves smothering opposition strikers			2
conceivably both legs of the semi-finals could finish 0 - 0 ( as well as the final ) and the @entity6 will be delighted to fast - forward to the penalty shootout			0
up front they rely on the example set by their talisman @entity156 , with his non-stop chasing and harrying of opposition defenders , plus his goals			0
the likes of @entity149 ( left ) and @entity162 have provided a solid defence for @entity164 to build on reasons they ca n’t … even @entity140 knows there are many limitations with this @entity122 team			1
do not get seduced by the cries of ‘ @entity173 ole ole ole , @entity164 , ’ because tiki - taka this is n’t			0
@entity177 ’s masterful powers are also on the wane after his brilliant career with @entity180 , @entity164 and @entity181			2
@entity177 still runs the show for the @entity122 , but the @entity6 's best days are now behind him @entity4 by @entity183 reasons they can win the @entity1 … it may be true that @entity2 have scored 115 goals this season but @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 have scored 95 between them			1
@entity4 ’s front three have clicked in a way that @entity194 would not have dared dream			2
neither is the @entity4 forward line ornamental when the team are defending			2
@entity189 drops deep to try to get the team passing — once he has stopped being @entity189 he will become the new @entity200 — and @entity190 defends from the front chasing down the opposition and forcing errors			0
there is a sense that they are carrying the team to @entity208			0
@entity4 's front three of @entity190 ( left ) , @entity191 ( centre ) and @entity189 can carry the whole team reasons they ca n’t … for now there are neither injuries nor suspensions but they are forever on the cusp of a potential crisis because the strength in depth is just not there			1
@entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 is a fine midfield but the second - string middle three of @entity226 , @entity227 and the now 35 - year - old @entity200 offers fewer guarantees			0
likewise at the back there is a gulf in class between the four first - choice defenders and those who would have to step in			0
injuries to key players like @entity222 could expose the lack of depth in @entity4 's squad			1

@entity2 *dmonstrated* their quality in second - leg *demolition* of @entity47
but @entity3 's side still have major vulnerabilities , as first leg showed
@entity8 may *struggle* without @entity109 , despite easier draw
@entity122 ' defence is reason for hope , but @entity177 is past his peak
@entity4 's front three is *formidable* , but they lack required depth
