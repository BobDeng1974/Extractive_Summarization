@entity0 has capped arguably the most remarkable test match in his long and successful career by bringing up a hundred in the same match in which the cricket world paid tribute to his ' little brother ' @entity7			1
those writing screenplays could scarcely have dreamt up such a script , as it is barely believable even in the often incredible pantheon , which is world sport			0

he brought up a magnificent century at the @entity19 after a second rain delay			0
his celebration was subdued at first , kissing the helmet and hugging @entity16 before allowing himself a small smile			2
@entity16 had earlier dedicated his own majestic ton to fallen mate @entity7 , pointing to the number 408 painted on the ground and then just moments later @entity0 brought up @entity28 's 408th run , the crowd standing as one to applaud the significance of the score			1

@entity0 underwent intense physio through the night and pain - killing injections to return to the crease for @entity28 on day two of the first cricket test against @entity45 paying tribute to his mate			1
@entity16 celebrates his hundred at the number 408 , signifying @entity7 ' test number , painted on the turf at the @entity19 there 's been pain in almost every movement @entity0 has made in his courageous innings at the @entity19			1
the 33 - year - old captain became the home side 's third century - maker in the first test @entity0 and @entity16 walk past the number 408 emblazoned on the @entity19 turf in honour of their former @entity93 and @entity49 team - mate , the late @entity7 decision made , @entity0 returns to the field of play for @entity28 despite a serious back injury which threatened , at one point , to keep him out of the rest of the match @entity0 's wife @entity47 is all smiles as the @entity49 captain returns to the crease less than 24 hours after his summer looked over because of a chronic back injury some experts said he would be unable to play again in the match , others even dared to suggest this could be the beginning of the end of a glittering career , yet the @entity49 cricket captain made a truly remarkable recovery from his back injury after retiring hurt on day one to bat again in the first innings			1
but @entity16 knows what his skipper is made of and confidently predicted @entity0 's reappearance at the crease when he said before the start of day two ' he ( @entity0 ) has had a few injections and he 's keen to get out there and bat today '			1
@entity0 , joined @entity16 for the resumption after being forced from the field on 60 during a dramatic first day of play in which @entity130 scored a magnificent century and @entity16 also racked up a half century			1
@entity0 's first scoring shot of the morning was a boundary through the covers to move him onto 64 but he is clearly restricted and in considerable pain , wincing with almost every shot			1
@entity0 of @entity28 comes out of the nets next to dr @entity137 after testing out his injury before day two of the first test match between @entity28 and @entity45 the @entity49 skipper takes to the nets to test his injured back ahead of day two of the cricket test the brains trust of the @entity49 cricket team including coach @entity145 and selector @entity146 discuss @entity0 's injury with the medical experts when rain interrupted play @entity28 was 6 for 405			1
physio @entity151 admitted he did n't have much sleep after @entity0 's injury and subsequent hospital visit			2
' we were certainly treating it into last night			0
he had an injection while there ( hospital ) , ' @entity151 said			0
' he 's got a chronic back injury , he dived to get back into the crease when @entity130 was on 99 , it 's quite a significant back injury			1
it 's poor timing and he 's struggling at the moment			0
' i do n't think it 's directly related to the hamstring injury which is on the other side			2
' down but not out			0
@entity0 succumbed to a chronic back injury on day one but was determined to play on in the first cricket test , joining @entity16 at the crease when play resumed on day two the moment @entity0 realised he would have to retire hurt on 60 after re-injuring his back ' he has n't had anything like this for 18 months , the last time was at the @entity182 in @entity183 , ' @entity151 said			1
@entity28 resumed at 6 - 354 with @entity16 unbeaten on 72 and @entity184			2
the skipper had to overcome a recurring left hamstring injury to play the rescheduled first test			0
@entity151 believed his current woes were unrelated to the hamstring issue			0
before he was hurt @entity0 was in typical mood , playing shots like this through the off - side on his way to 60 and in support of @entity130 's century ' this is his right lower back			1
this is his old injury , what he 's had in the past , ' he said			0
' i do n't think it 's directly related to his hamstring , because it 's the other side			0
' we believe it 's related to his old disc injuries			0
with that comes a lot of muscle spasms and other things that cause pain			0
' so we 're just trying to relieve those elements of it and make sure we give him the best possible chance			0
' the skipper ducked inside a short ball from @entity219 quick @entity218 in the 44th over and instantly grimaced in pain			0
@entity0 stretched his back and spoke to @entity151 and doctor @entity137 before trudging off the field			2
@entity151 revealed the initial flare - up occurred seven overs earlier when @entity0 dived to make his ground at the non-striker 's end			2
' he felt it a little bit there			0
then he tried to get out the way of a bouncer and it really grabbed , ' he said .			0
