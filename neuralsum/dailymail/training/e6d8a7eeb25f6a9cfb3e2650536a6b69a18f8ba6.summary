the report is contained in the internal @entity7 files of a 1998 police investigation into claims the former coach showered with an 11 - year - old boy			1
the documents , made public for the first time , raise fresh questions about how the case was handled by the university and local authorities			0
' i thought my report was strong enough to suggest that this was somebody who should be watched			0
' @entity12 described her anger when police informed her last year that @entity2 had allegedly molested 10 other boys , 13 years after her clear warning			1
' i was horrified to know that there were so many other innocent boys who had their hearts and minds confused , their bodies violated , ' @entity12 told @entity25			0
the boy is now known as victim 6 in the criminal case against the former coach due to go to trial this spring			2
having spoken with her client and his mother , @entity12 described in her report how @entity2 had coaxed the boy into the shower after a workout , telling him , ' all the guys do			1

' @entity12 gave her damning report , pictured , to @entity7 police officer @entity107 in may , 1998 @entity2 had also kissed the boy on the forehead and told him , ‘ i love you ' , according to the report , before inviting him to his house to ' sit on his lap ' and go ' online ' on his computer			1
' my consultants agree that the incidents meet all of our definitions , based on experience and education , of a likely pedophile ’s pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch , within a context of a ‘ loving , ’ ‘ special ’ relationship , ” @entity116 said in her report			0
@entity12 gave her report to @entity7 police officer @entity107 in may , 1998			2
the police file shows that the investigation continued under the late @entity136 , local district attorney at the time , and a second boy who said @entity2 also hugged him in the @entity7 showers was interviewed , reports @entity25			1
@entity2 , pictured outside court last month , was not charged after the 1998 investigation , instead he was advised by police not to shower with children victim 6 's mother had reported concerns over @entity2 's constant attempt to contact her child , which led to police monitoring two confrontations between her and the coach when he called at boy 's home			1

in the transcript , contained in the file obatained by @entity25 , she asked if the boy and coach 's ' private parts ' had touched during the bear hug			0

@entity188 stated that he would n’t			0
' this was followed by the words : ' @entity193 '			0
