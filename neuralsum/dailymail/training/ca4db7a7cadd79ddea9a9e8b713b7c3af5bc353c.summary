@entity6 , 43 , from @entity7 in @entity8 began suffering from stomach pains in april last year			1
when she researched her symptoms on @entity11 and began to believe that she had either ovarian or pancreatic cancer and went straight to her doctor			2
@entity6 , 43 ( right , pictured with @entity14 ) , from @entity7 in @entity8 began suffering from stomach pains in april last year			1
she was convinced she had pancreatic cancer but tests did not detect it			1
just 10 months later she was dead but after tests for ovarian cancer were negative and she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome , her family thought there was nothing too serious to worry about			1
when @entity6 's health deteriorated doctors dealt with the two blood clots on her lungs but never managed to diagnose the underlying problem			1
and just a week before she died in january when she was bed - bound , an @entity30 helpline adviser suggested she get up and do some exercise			1
family : @entity6 with her grandson @entity33			1
@entity32 paid tribute to the ' kind and loving mum and grandma ' far from being able to get out of bed , within six days her mother @entity38 , 61 , and sister @entity39 , 26 , had found her dead at her home			1
@entity14 said : ' it 's a heart - breaking situation thinking she knew what it was for all that time			2
' we are just trying to make something positive out of a terrible situation			0
' @entity6 did n't open the door when @entity38 and @entity14 went to pick her up for a scheduled hospital appointment to treat her blood clot			1
when they finally got a spare set of keys and made it in @entity6 was in her bed and not breathing			1
screaming in horror , @entity14 ran into the street for help and called an ambulance but it was too late and neither cpr from a neighbour nor paramedics could save her			0
devastatingly , her post-mortem revealed she had been right all along			0
she had died from heart failure caused by pancreatic cancer			0
now her mother and sister are desperately raising awareness in the hope that the same tragedy will not strike another family			0
@entity14 , who is doing a sponsored 10k next week to raise money for @entity75 , said there is not enough education about pancreatic cancer stoic : @entity39 and her mother @entity38			0
the pair are desperately raising awareness in the hope that the same tragedy will not strike another family pancreatic cancer is responsible for around 9,000 deaths in the @entity86 every year , with fewer than four per cent of patients surviving five years or more after diagnosis			0
it is the ninth most common cancer - around 9,000 are diagnosed annually			1
symptoms tend to manifest once the cancer is advanced and include unexpected weight loss , upper abdominal pain and jaudice - all of which could be a multitude of illnesses			2
so the condition is often diagnosed late			2
treatment ideally involves removal of the tumour , though such surgery is only suitable for up to 20 per cent of patients			0
chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also be offered			0
@entity6 leaves behind a daughter @entity105 , 16 , a son @entity106 , 23 , and a one - year - old grandson @entity33 , as well as a large family including her two brothers @entity110 , and @entity111 , 31			1
@entity14 , who is doing a sponsored 10k next week to raise money for @entity75 , said : ' people are n't educated well enough about pancreatic cancer			0
' although it 's more common in older people , it can strike young women and we want to help people realise that			0
' no - one else should have to go through what @entity6 did			1
' a test suggested there was a high chance of cancer and @entity6 became hysterical			2
' but an emergency ultrasound revealed she did n't have ovarian cancer and ultimately she was never diagnosed with any kind of cancer			0
' her laugh was unmistakable and she was well - known and well - liked by everyone			0
' but most of all she was a kind and loving mum and grandma and that 's been taken away now			0
' @entity135 ( right ) with her daughter @entity6			2
she found her dead when she went to pick her up for a scheduled hospital appointment to treat her blood clot			2

but tests came up negative and she was diagnosed with another condition
a week before she died an @entity30 helpline adviser urged her to get exercise
the 43 - year - old grandmother was found dead at her home
