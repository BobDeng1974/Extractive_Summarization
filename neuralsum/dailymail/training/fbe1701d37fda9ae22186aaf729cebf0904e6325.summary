a new series of images provide food - for - thought when it comes to the future of some of @entity7 's most populated coastal towns			1
@entity8 , 24 , has produced some worrying illustrations of how @entity11 's biggest cities will become lost to the ocean if scientists ' predictions of the effects of global warming prove correct			1
@entity17 , becomes consumed by the very bay it is constructed next to			0
@entity20 resembles scenes from @entity20 , @entity22 as the @entity23 slowly deluges the trendy @entity25 neighborhood			0
and @entity27 's position as a naval town is virtually washed away as the unforgiving sea water floods the towns docks and promenades			2
@entity20 , @entity11 : today , @entity20 is known for its canals , beaches and circus - like @entity34 , a two - and - a - half - mile pedestrian - only promenade @entity20 : @entity20 would have more in common with its @entity22 namesake if the sea levels rise 12 feet as shown here submarine required : @entity20 has long since disappeared in this shocking vision of the future after sea levels rise by 25 feet drowning slowly : even at a 5 - foot rise in sear level , the beach is able to keep the rising @entity23 at bay and life continues as normal with a rise in sea levels of 12 - feet , the famous beach and its promenade is all but washed away @entity52 ' @entity7 : you might need a surfboard more than a skateboard to get around parts of @entity20 in the year 2500 ! it could take several centuries for sea levels to rise to that level but artist and researcher @entity8 hopes his work will raise public awareness about the very real threat of global warming today			1
mr @entity8 used data and methods from @entity68 , an independent organization of leading scientists and journalists researching and reporting the facts about the changing climate and its impact on the @entity7 public			2
@entity8 interpreted @entity68 's sea level rise maps and flood elevation formula to arrive at these images ' sea level rise that makes cities uninhabitable is not going to happen in our lifetime , but , it is going to happen sooner or later unless we cut carbon emissions			2
our first sea level rise project covered only @entity86 cities			2
i felt it would be fitting to bring attention to sea level rise on the @entity92 as well , ' he says			0
the @entity17 : @entity93 , home of the @entity95 baseball team is already perched perilously close to the bay from which the city earns its nickname fancy a swim ? just 12 feet of water turns the baseball stadium into an open - air swimming pool as the bay begins to consume the city according to the @entity105 , the seas will rise by an average of 6.6 feet by 2100			0
then over the coming centuries , as temperatures rise and ice sheets melt , the oceans could rise as much as 20 or 30 feet			0
@entity8 has created images which show famous cities will look like under 5 feet ( projected increase over the next 100 to 300 years ) , 12 feet ( potential level in 2300 ) , and 25 feet ( the potential level in coming centuries ) of water			1
the @entity7 national climate assessment report notes that of an increase in average @entity7 temperatures of about 1.5 degrees f since 1895 , when reliable national record - keeping began , more than 80 percent had occurred in the past three decades			0
with heat - trapping gases already in the atmosphere , temperatures could rise by a further 2 to 4 degrees f in most parts of the country over the next few decades , the report said			0
sand bags required : waterfront views are all around as the @entity27 water level rises 5 feet higher than present - day levels @entity133 : @entity27 appears to have more in common with @entity134 in this picture of how things might look in 500 years time @entity27 , 25 - feet down : this once pretty park is now more suited to divers than dog - walkers ! @entity140 : beautiful @entity141 , part of the @entity144 , as it looks today waterfront views : the resulting illustrations give us a sobering glimpse into our potential future darling it 's better , down where it 's wetter ... or maybe not as this picture shows @entity17 12 - feet under beautiful : @entity141 and the @entity17 skyline			1
the remaining structures of the former @entity157 are in the foreground @entity159 , 5 - feet below : as global sea level rises , coastal cities and islands face a growing risk of being washed away a vision of the future : under 25 feet of water , there 's not much left of the old @entity141 @entity168 and dry : with a 5 - foot change in sea level , very little has altered and life continues as normal @entity27 , 25 - feet - under : @entity8 used sea level rise maps from @entity68 to create a formula to calculate how much water there would be on the ground in a specific location			1

@entity8 's new illustrations of @entity7 's west coast show many of @entity11 's *iconic* *destinations* under 25 feet of water
artist produced a similar set of pictures for @entity7 east coast cities
sea levels are rising by around 1.7mm per year and is expected to continue for centuries
2012 was the *hottest* year ever in the @entity7
