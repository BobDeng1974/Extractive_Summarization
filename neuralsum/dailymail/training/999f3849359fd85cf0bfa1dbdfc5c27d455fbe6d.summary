@entity0 insists @entity2 ' players have to step up to the plate to keep @entity4 in his job			1
the @entity2 manager is under growing pressure after an indisciplined 2 - 0 loss to @entity9 on saturday left the @entity11 club nine points adrift in the @entity13			1
crippled by the loss of midfielder @entity15 to a needless red card after 21 minutes at @entity17 , a 1,000 - strong travelling support turned on their manager vocally even before @entity22 ’s decisive strike from the penalty spot			1
@entity0 has demanded his @entity2 team give more for manager @entity4 ( above ) hearts beat @entity2 2 - 0 on saturday to move nine points clear at the top of the @entity13 handed a start in place of the misfiring @entity31 , @entity0 admitted the players let their manager down and now have to answer key questions			1
‘ once we go out on the park we need to provide performances and wins , ’ said the @entity34			2
‘ the last couple of weeks we ’ve not done that			2
we need to start doing that for the manager to start helping him out			2
‘ all the boys really like the manager and the coaching staff			2
you have to look close to home as players and ask ourselves are we doing enough to help him out when we go out there ? ’ a defiant @entity4 says he has given no thought to his own position and insists @entity2 can still reel in @entity9 to win automatic promotion			1
beaten in all three meetings with the @entity17 side and @entity57 rivals @entity56 , however , saturday ’s loss was a bitter blow which raised fresh questions over the managerial future of the club ’s all time top scorer			1
@entity0 ( left ) receives a booking from referee @entity65 ( centre ) in the game against @entity9 @entity67 ( centre ) celebrates scoring for @entity9 against @entity2 on saturday unhappy with @entity15 for a reckless , dangerous sliding challenge on @entity70 , @entity4 said the converted full - back had let his side down			1
‘ obviously a decision , a red card , has n’t helped him , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ that ’s not me saying i think @entity76 ( @entity15 ) has let us down , i do n’t think he has , i think he ’s unfortunate			0
‘ he ’s gone to win the ball and he ’s slightly late			0
in this day and age , you seem to get red cards for tackles like that			0
’ referee @entity65 showed leniency towards @entity2 in the second half when @entity86 and @entity31 were spared red cards for further late challenges			2
@entity22 ( right ) converts a penalty for @entity9 during the match at @entity17 against @entity2 @entity86 appeared to be unhappy with @entity70 for his reaction to the @entity15 red card and a subsequent later challenge			1
suggesting @entity9 — who could be missing @entity95 for up to three months after he was injured following a @entity86 challenge — contributed to the nine yellow and one red card shown by referee @entity65 , @entity0 added : ‘ for me , i do n’t think their reaction helps the situation , but that seems to be the way football is			1
it ’s changed an awful lot since i started playing			0
‘ that seems to be coming in a lot more into the game , players trying to get people booked and sent off			0
‘ i do n’t think it ’s the right thing to be doing but that is obviously the way football seems to be changing			0
‘ i think it ’s a man ’s game and when a player gets hit and he goes down screaming like he ’s been shot by a sniper i do n’t think it really helps the case			0
‘ obviously , the referee hears a scream and sees the reaction of a player rolling on the floor and he thinks he has been seriously hurt			0
you have to cut the referee a bit of slack because if he sees that he thinks it ’s a serious injury			0
‘ but you have to ask questions of the players if they are trying to con the ref or not			0
