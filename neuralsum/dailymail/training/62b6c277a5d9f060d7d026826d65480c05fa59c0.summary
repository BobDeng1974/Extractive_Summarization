a chlorine gas leak at a suburban @entity2 hotel hosting an annual @entity4 furry convention sent 19 people to hospitals because of nausea and dizziness and forced the evacuation of thousands of guests , including many in cartoonish animal costumes			1
investigators believe the early sunday leak at the @entity15 in @entity16 was caused intentionally and are treating it as a criminal matter			1
the @entity19 says authorities responded to the hotel at around 12.45am			2
the source appeared to be powdered chlorine found in a 9th - floor stairwell show must go on : officials assured attendees sunday afternoon that the convention events would continue as scheduled despite the apparent attack it was evacuated because of high levels of chlorine gas in the air			1
the source appeared to be powdered chlorine found in a 9th - floor stairwell			1
police say the manner through which the gas was dispersed ' suggests an intentional act , ' reports the @entity57			2
now police are investigating the incident as a crime			2
' it was shocking , ' attendee @entity61 , who was visiting @entity28 from @entity62 , told the @entity57			1
photos from the aftermath of the apparent attack showed groups of rattled conventioneers , some still wearing elaborate animal costumes , standing outside the @entity71 as @entity72 whisked away those who 'd taken ill. ' a lot of people thought this was just someone pulling the fire alarm , ' 27 - year - old @entity74 told the @entity57			1
' but it was serious this time			2
' as the convention returned to its regularly scheduled programming sunday , event officials struggled to keep an optimistic atmosphere after someone tried ruining the annual celebration of all things furry according to @entity87 : someone who says they are furry is generally expressing an interest in anthropomorphic animals and / or creatures ( and perhaps some affiliation to )			1
they may express that that interest in a variety of ways - through art and stories through to roleplay and performance			1
how deep or meaningful an interest in @entity104 is varies greatly from person to person			2
some furries look at their affiliation to and / or expression of an anthropomorphic animal -- called a fursona -- as a means of expressing how they feel they truly are , that is ' an animal in a human body ' other furries are more akin to @entity120 attendees in that they dress in costumes that mimic their favorite cartoon characters			1
some furries express themselves through the ' fursuiting ' that the group has become so synonymous with , but others express their furrydom without the use of actual fur			0
still other furries derive sexual pleasure out of dressing like anthropomorphic animals and may dress in costumes that may be worn during sexual acts			0
arm - in - arm : the entire @entity71 was evacuated just after 1am sunday morning sickened : nineteen were taken to hospitals complaining of nausea and dizziness after the gas released all - clear : the hotel remained evacuated for hours until after 4am , when an all - clear was finally given by a hazmat team terrifying : the @entity15 was cmopletely evacuated for several hours facilities near the @entity16 hotel accommodated guests after the hotel was completely evacuated at 1.10am			1
according to a @entity28 statement , a team in full hazmat gear responded to the scene as some attendees waited anxiously outside			1
' at 4:21 am the all - clear was given and we worked with the @entity71 staff to return all of our guests to the hotel in the quickest and safest manner possible , ' reads the @entity28 statement			1
in spite of the rattling night , the events for sunday were scheduled to all go on as planned			1
' all events scheduled for today will continue to operate on schedule			0
we are all running on little sleep			0
your patience is appreciated , ' organizers tweeted sunday before noon			2
the hotel is hosting the 2014 @entity28 convention , where attendees dress as animals to celebrate art , literature and performance			1
chlorine , a chemical used in industry and water purification process , was first introduced as a chemical weapon at @entity178 in @entity179 with disastrous effects because gas masks were not easily available at the time			0
