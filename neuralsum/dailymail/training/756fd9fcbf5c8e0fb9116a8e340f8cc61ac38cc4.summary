by @entity0 drivers who struggle to reverse into tight spaces need worry no more for @entity3 has developed an app that will take over the entire process			1
the automatic parking system involves installing 12 sensors into a car which scan the road and park up , without any bumps or scrapes			1
so sophisticated is the technology that the driver can run the parking process from the side of the road using an app on their smartphone			2
the automatic parking assist system was unveiled by @entity43 electronics company at the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) in @entity45			1
the system is the latest evidence to show that drivers will increasingly become passengers as computers take over the business of getting from a to @entity52 in a separate development , @entity53 has unveiled a new app involving its gear smartwatch , which can communicate with and control some aspects of @entity59 ’s new i3 electric car			1
@entity3 chairman @entity60 has said he believes driverless cars will be a reality but they will arrive gradually , with this driver assistance technology marking the first step			2
some car manufacturers already offer parking assist , where an on - board computer and sensors take over the process of steering while the driver pushes the brake and accelerator			2
however , the new @entity3 design goes one step further to take over the entire process			2
demonstrating the technology , @entity77 , engineering manager at @entity3 , said : ‘ the vehicle is fitted with 12 ultra-sonic sensors and when the driver wishes to park they just have to enable the system and sensors start scanning the environment			1
‘ if a suitable parking space is found the driver can either stay in the vehicle or step out and , using their smartphone , let the vehicle do the rest			0
the system controls vehicle speed and the steering wheel and gear shift			0
’ the technology , which will be available next year , will also help drivers from wandering out of their lane on the motorway			0
the system will be pre-installed in new cars by a range of manufacturers , who have not yet been named			0
in theory , it may also be possible to add it to older cars , providing they have an on - board computer that allows control of the steering and gears			0
@entity53 has unveiled a new app involving its @entity56 ( pictured ) , which can communicate with and control some aspects of @entity59 's new i3 electric car mr @entity77 said : ‘ this is good for everybody , especially for parking in a traffic situation or anybody who does n’t feel comfortable parallel or perpendicular parking , especially when the visibility is limited			1
‘ there is a lot of hype about autonomous driving and that is a stepping stone in that direction			0
’ the company is already working on the next advance in the technology , which will allow drivers to drop their car at the entrance of a car park			0
it will then negotiate its way through the building to find a spare space			0
this system - dubbed valet parking – would also allow the motorist to retrieve the vehicle by starting it up remotely with a smartphone			0
@entity3 also unveiled technology to brake a car if it detects a pedestrian or an obstacle in the road			1
the automatic emergency breaking system uses a sensor mounted behind the windscreen to sense dangers in the path of the car , and halt if the driver fails to			2

the automatic emergency breaking system uses a sensor mounted behind the windscreen to sense dangers in the path of the car , and halt if the driver fails to brake @entity170 , a technical manager at @entity3 , said : ‘ the sensors works in the manner of the human eye			1
‘ there is a camera that sees what the driver sees but can measure the distance of any obstacle , be it pedestrians or obstacles in the road , and can give a signal to the brakes to engage if the driver is not paying attention			0
’ this technology will come pre-installed in cars and the reaction time can be adjusted according to manufacturer specifications			0
@entity59 ’s new electric car the i3 is installed with a mobile phone sim card that links to the vehicles on - board computer			1
@entity53 has developed an app that works with its smartphones and the @entity199 that can connect to the car ’s controls			1
the smartwatch screen will show the status of the @entity192 ’s battery charge and current drivable range , check that the doors are locked and provide alerts about the need for a service			0
users can also remotely regulate the temperature of their @entity192 ’s interior before getting in the car by using the touchscreen on a @entity53 phone or a voice command .			2
