food charities plunged into a row with the government yesterday after claiming that 20 million free meals were handed out last year to people too poor to buy food			1
the charities , led by the aid giant @entity7 , said that there was a rise in numbers of desperate people turning to food banks in even the most affluent parts of the country , and that half a million children are living in families that can not provide ‘ a minimally acceptable diet ’			1
but the claims were challenged yesterday after it emerged that more than half of the free meals were not given out to people who can not afford to eat but to other good causes such as pensioners ’ lunch clubs			1
revelations : it has emerged that more than half of the free meals from food charities were not given out to people who can not afford to eat but to other good causes such as pensioners ' lunch clubs ( file picture ) sources close to work and pensions secretary @entity38 have disputed the charities ’ figures			1
' it is simply not possible to draw conclusions from these unverified figures drawn from disparate sources , ’ a spokesman for the @entity42 said			2
the three charities published a report , below the @entity49 , which said that ‘ food banks and food aid charities gave more than 20 million meals last year to people in the @entity54 who could not afford to feed themselves			1
’ it said this was a 54 per cent increase on the previous year , and that the need for food aid was a result of ‘ a perfect storm of changes to the social security system , benefit sanctions , low and stagnant wages , insecure and zero - hours contracts and rising food and energy prices			0
’ the report , released in the name of @entity7 , @entity71 , and the @entity73 food bank organisation , said 20,247,042 charity meals were provided in the financial year that ended in april			0
however critics said the numbers could not be considered to count meals given to people who are unable to afford to feed themselves , because more than half were supplied by a charity called @entity82 , which does not feed the hungry , but instead gives food to other charities			1
@entity82 , which was responsible for 12 million of the 20 million meals counted in the @entity7 report , collects unsold food from @entity88 ’s and other supermarkets which would otherwise be destroyed or disposed of , and distributes it to charities that can use it			2
these include , according to its website , lunch clubs for pensioners , including some run by the @entity98 , charities that help vulnerable adults , and women ’s refuges			0
backlash : sources close to work and pensions secretary @entity38 have disputed the charities ' figures one example is the @entity106 , near @entity109 ’s fashionable @entity108 district , where chefs teach families and children how to cook healthy meals			1
the school ’s manager is quoted by @entity82 saying : ‘ we tried running the classes at a cost of £ 5 but people said , although they would like to come , they could n’t afford to			0
because of @entity82 , we can now open up the workshops at a low cost to low income families			0
’ critics of the @entity7 report said such meals are not going to people who are too poor to feed themselves			0
‘ the largest share comes from @entity82 , ’ a source close to mr @entity38 said			0
‘ @entity82 redistribute food from supermarkets to around 1300 charities and community groups , which is then used in places such as community cafes , domestic violence refuges and elderly drop - in centres			2
‘ this supports charities by helping them to keep their costs down while cutting down on food waste - which is clearly very different to provision of emergency food aid through foodbanks			2
’ most of the remainder of the meals suppled were 8,218,242 provided by the food bank operator the @entity73			0
the @entity73 hands out packages of food to last people three days , which the @entity7 report calculated as nine meals			0
it is unknown how many people claimed the 900,000 or so packages provided by the @entity73 , because it counts only the number of food parcels handed out and takes no account of numbers of repeat visits			1
however figures from one @entity73 food bank , in @entity162 , suggest that fewer than half its clients visit only once and more than one in five apply for food on more than three occasions in a year			0
thus suggests the number of people using its food banks is in fact much lower than 900,000 .			1

charities said a growing number of people are turning to food banks
*500,000* children are living in families that can not provide a minimum diet
but @entity42 has disputed the claims
