the global @entity1 death toll has risen to almost 5,000			1
and as humanitarian efforts ramp up , @entity3 roboticists and government groups are planning a summit to discuss how robots could be the key to curbing the spread of the disease			1
during a series of events in november , these experts will share the results of current research and debate what kind of robots are needed to help manage the crisis			1
during a series of events in november , roboticists will share the results of current research and debate what kind of robots are needed to help manage the crisis			2
for example , germ - killing robot ' @entity22 ' ( pictured ) is designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes , and is being used to keep hospitals @entity1 - free the first talk will be co-hosted by the @entity29 ’s @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , on 7 november , led by professor of computer science and engineering @entity33			1
simultaneous events will be also be held by the @entity36 , @entity37 and the @entity38			0
in a blog post , professor @entity33 outlined nine ways robots could play a role in stopping the @entity1 outbreak			1
these included mortuary robots , to transport the deceased , robots that can detect and disinfect rooms , ambulances and houses that have held infected people , as well as ‘ rolling interpreters ’ to help translate between aid workers , doctors and patients			1
simultaneous events will be also be held by the @entity36 of @entity54 , @entity29 , @entity37 and the @entity38			1
other robots that will be discussed including drones that can deliver food and medicine ( @entity60 's @entity59 is pictured ) automated trucks could also deliver aid			2
in february , the @entity63 tested a convoy of autonomous military trucks in @entity66 ( pictured )			0
the demonstration was a joint project between the @entity69 ( @entity70 ) and @entity71 in @entity72 for example , a germ - killing robot designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes is being used to keep hospitals @entity1 - free			1
called ' @entity22 ' , the robot works by damaging viral dna using pulses of ultraviolet light			0
it is currently being used in 250 hospitals and health facilities across the @entity3 , including a @entity86 hospital where a patient with the first case of @entity1 diagnosed in @entity3 was being treated			1
similarly , researchers from the @entity90 have created ‘ @entity91 ’ – a robot that emits ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria , including @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , methicillin - resistant @entity96 ( @entity97 ) and potentially @entity1			1
professor @entity33 proposes nine possible technologies that could help tackle the disease			0
these include : mortuary robots : these would respectfully transport the deceased , because @entity1 is most virulent at the time of death , and immediately following death robot replacements for health professionals : robots that could be used in biosafety labs and field hospitals , for tasks such as automated materials handling and remote patient care			1
detection of contamination : robots that scour vehicles , rooms , buildings and even public spaces for signs of the disease ambulance or house have @entity1 disinfection : robots that open the drawers and doors for the commercially available @entity22 disinfectant robot professor @entity33 proposes nine possible technologies that could help tackle the disease			1
these include mortuary robots that would transport the deceased , and reconnaisance drones and bots that scour for signs of illness and people fleeing infected regions ( @entity141 510 @entity140 is pictured ) telepresence robots : experts could use such robots to consult and advise on medical issues , train and supervise worker decontamination , and serve as ' rolling interpreters ' for the different languages and dialects			1
physical security : robotic guards to protect workers during riots , as those seen in @entity155			0
waste handling : robots that transport biowaste from infected sites			1
humanitarian relief : this includes autonomous food trucks and drones that deliver food and medicine			2
reconnaissance : drones and other types of robots that scour for signs of illness and people fleeing infected regions all of which are commonly referred to as ' superbugs ' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments			2
other ideas include autonomous food trucks and delivery drones , as well as reconnaissance and telepresence robots			2
logistics firm @entity60 , owned by @entity184 's @entity183 , is planning to send ' parcelcopters ' flying at up to 40mph ( 65km/h ) to the car - free island of @entity189 , off @entity184 's northern coast			0
text messages are currently helping in the fight against @entity1 in @entity155 , with people receiving public health text alerts and sending messages about food security to aid agencies ( pictured )			2
experts could use similar services to consult and advise on medical issues and train and supervise worker decontamination the global @entity1 death toll has risen to almost 5,000			1
@entity1 ( pictured ) emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in @entity204 and near the @entity205 in the @entity206 of @entity207 are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent the drone is designed to deliver medication and other urgently needed goods to the island at times when other modes of transport are not operating			1
@entity1 emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in @entity204 and near the @entity205 in the @entity218			2
there are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent			2
in the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent			0
it is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats , which are eaten as a delicacy			0
the virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people			0
symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			0
people are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days			0
although the disease has no cure , modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down			1
if the trial is successful , the craft could be used to deliver packages to other remote areas , or in emergencies such as during the @entity1 crisis			2
in february , the @entity63 tested a convoy of autonomous military trucks in @entity66			0
the demonstration was a joint project between the @entity69 ( @entity70 ) and @entity71 in @entity72			0
each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections , oncoming traffic , stalled and passing vehicles , pedestrians and traffic circles in both urban and rural test areas			0
the autonomous vehicles were part of the @entity63 and @entity283 ’ @entity284 ( @entity286 ) program			0
the successful convoy was the final stage of the program ’s @entity289			0
‘ in order to be successful at any one of the tasks , robots have to meet a lot of hidden requirements and sometimes the least exciting or glamorous job can be of the most help to the workers , ’ explained professor @entity33			0
‘ can an isolated field hospital handle a heavy robot in the muddy rainy season ? how will the robots be transported there ? ' is it easy enough for the locals to use so that they can be engaged and earn a living wage ? what kind of network communication is available ? what if it needs repairs ? ‘ that ’s what i am working on , applying the lessons learned in robotics for meteorological and geological disasters			0
’ @entity29 students will also be creating prototype aid robots as part of the @entity322 invent ‘ what would you build for a @entity326 ’ event this weekend , while graduate students will be students designing and simulating intelligent robots			1
@entity31 is additionally planning to host another workshop to share the results of their current research into specific use cases with the robotics community in january			0
this year has seen the worst outbreak in history of the @entity1 ( @entity1 )			2
this scene shows bodies being taken away in @entity155			0
professor @entity33 from @entity29 claims that this high death toll requires so - called mortuary robots to transport the deceased			1

summit will be hosted by @entity30 for @entity345
experts will discuss how robots can help halt the spread of deadly diseases
this includes mortuary robots , disinfection machines and waste handlers
students at @entity29 will additionally create prototype models
the global @entity1 death toll has risen to almost 5,000
