the future of the @entity2 licence fee has been thrown into doubt as it emerged that less than half of @entity5 think that it is good value for money			1
new figures reveal that just 44 per cent of viewers think that the £ 145.50 annual charge is the best way to fund the public broadcaster , with others supporting advertising or voluntary subscriptions			1
the findings come after it was found that a dwindling number of television sets in @entity5 and a growing number of online - tv viewers could also threatening the future of the licence fee			1
dwindling support : new figures reveal that just 44 per cent of viewers think that the £ 145.50 annual charge is the best way to fund offerings such as @entity28 , above , from the public broadcaster the latest poll , conducted by @entity31 for the @entity32 , found that there had been a 4 per cent drop in the number of viewers who thought the licence fee was good value for money			1
though the licence fee is the favoured single method as a means to support @entity43 , 45 per cent would prefer an alternative means of funding			1
of those , 25 per cent would support the introduction of advertising as a form of revenue , while 13 per cent thought voluntary subscriptions would be effective			0
a combination of the two alternative methods garnered just 7 per cent of the votes			0
and 11 per cent of respondents said that they did not know how the @entity43 should be funded			2
it comes after it emerged last month that children watch half the amount of tv as their parents			0
youngsters between the age of 11 and 15 spend six times longer watching internet video clips as older viewers , but spend much less time in front of traditional sets , an @entity62 survey found			0
threat to the future : children spend less time watching tv than older viewers			0
( file image ) because the licence fee only applies to those who watch or record tv and not to those who watch up catch - up shows or other internet content , many future adults may be exempt			1
the problem is compounded by the fact that there are also fewer television sets in the @entity5 for the first time ever			1
in the report published this month , @entity62 highlighted @entity2 figures revealing that in july this year , 47 per cent of people accessing @entity88 were doing so through tablets or mobiles , an increase from just 25 per cent in october 2012			2
the report said there are now approximately 900,000 households with access to the internet but no television set and so rely on internet services to watch programmes			0
on average , people in the @entity5 watch four hours of television a day , with ‘ linear viewing ’ – meaning watching show at the time when it is broadcast – still being the most popular way of consuming television			2
although the level of television viewing dropped by 4 per cent in 2013 , @entity62 has said it is ‘ not yet clear whether this was the beginning of a longer - term trend or merely a temporary variation			0
’ the @entity2 told @entity113 : ' at just £ 2.80 a week per household the @entity2 provides excellent value for money			2
it means that programmes like @entity125 , @entity28 , @entity126 , @entity116 and @entity117 can be watched by everyone , not a select few , along with our radio stations , news , iplayer and our website			0
' public support for the licence fee has risen since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the @entity2 - indeed , another @entity31 poll for @entity32 earlier in december showed 51 % support for the licence fee			1

just 44 per cent of poll respondents agreed licence fee was good value
while 45 per cent would rather @entity2 be supported by alternate funding
comes after it emerged that @entity5 has fewer tvs and more online viewers
