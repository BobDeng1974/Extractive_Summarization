by @entity0 he 's probably just as famous for his luscious flowing hair as he is for his football but now @entity3 has chopped off his ponytail in favour of a smooth , short back and sides style			1
the footballer , 40 , claims he decided on the change after arriving at the airport ahead of the @entity10 with his wife 's passport - because they both shared the same hairstyle in their pictures			2
the @entity16 star also admits he wants to ' grow old gracefully ' with his new modern haircut - and his hairdresser reveals how the pair decided to change his hair			2
many women deicde to go for the chop around 46 in favour of ' a more mature style ' according to new research , and it seems @entity3 's decided to do the same now he 's approaching his 40s			1
he bravely posted an image on his @entity42 account showing off the results			0
speaking to @entity44 , @entity3 said : ' i turn 40 in october , and although age is only a number , there comes a time when you have to grow old gracefully			1
' i ’ve left the 1980s and 1990s behind , and finally i ’ve caught up with the modern world - and i feel liberated			0
it ’s literally a big weight off my shoulders ! ' @entity3 looks nervous as he sits in the barber 's chair at friend @entity57 's salon @entity58 caught up with @entity3 's hairdresser @entity57 , who has a salon in @entity60 , and discussed the hair change			1
' i 've been cutting @entity3 's hair for a little while now and we 'd been talking for some time in regards to changing it , ' he said			1
' i do a lot of @entity69 players [ hair ] , cyclists , cricket celebrities and other sporting people because of the area that the salon is in ... ' the day @entity3 got the chop was a big day for him			1
he 's so well known for his hair and that particular style , being so long and so blonde - it 's not something that he took lightly			1
' it was more @entity3 's decision to go for it			1
we had a few consultations of which way to go and how short to go			0
@entity87 posted this long forgotten picture of @entity3 before he grew his famous long hair ' my job is to make people look good so the challenge was to come up with something that would suit his face shape			2
he has a love of fashion as well as hair			0
the quiff and the 1950s pompadour styles now are really big these days , so we used that influence but kept his hair sharp as well as it being able to mess about ... with that style you can dress it up and scruff it up as well			2
' he was nervous but a good client to have in the chair			0
i think he 's getting to that age now where he 's looking for a change , but at the same time you do n't want to lose your identity			0
i 'm 47 and the one thing i 've realised is as you get older you should do what you feel			0
' @entity3 's hair had been the same for a while ... no - one 's really wearing that shape any more , almost a bob style			1
i was telling him at the end of the day that hair was passé - i was reinfocring what he wanted to do			0
' we are going to be tweaking it and changing it ... we did n't want to do too much at once because he was attached to it for so long			0
' @entity3 's hair had been the same for a while , pictured mid- 00s			1
he 's now gone for a modern change celebrity and runway stylist , @entity131 , whose clients include @entity135 and @entity136 : ' in some cases , getting the chop on long hair can help men look younger because generally , going for a tighter style on the sides slims down the face and accentuates the jaw line , giving a more handsome look			2
' i do n't necessarily think there 's a definitive age men should go for a chop ; it 's all down to suitability taking into consideration factors such as face shape , weight and quality of hair			0
for example if the hair is ageing , thinning and generally in bad condition then it makes sense to go for a style that gives the impression of thicker hair			0
a great way to make the hair appear denser is to go for a shorter style just as @entity3 has			1
' ten years ago @entity167 loved experimenting with highlights and length ( l ) but now looks much better ( r ) @entity171 's musician husband @entity170 in 2005 ( l ) and recently looking much more suave ( r ) @entity172 looking a little ' explorer in the wilderness ' in 2006 ( l ) and at the @entity175 , march 14 ( r )			0
