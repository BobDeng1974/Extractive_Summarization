changes were also made to pages on the deaths of @entity34 and schoolboy @entity35 from government computers which downplayed their deaths , the investigation found			1
the updates were made from computers using the government 's secure intranet service , which is used by the civil service and police officers			1
the uncovering of the edits comes just weeks after a civil servant was sacked for posting offensive @entity3 comments on the @entity50 disaster from government computers			1
today mr @entity15 's family said there must be an investigation into who made the edits , and action taken			2
' we have someone sitting in a government office spending time to undermine and smear an innocent man 's memory , ' family spokesman @entity58 told @entity21			1
' it 's low and it 's callous and we have to find out did this person act on orders , and if so whose orders ? ' the investigation found that in 2006 government computers were used to add suspicions that mr @entity15 had a ' high level ' of @entity74 drugs in his blood at the time of his death			1
there was also an attempted request that @entity3 editors change the reason for the police decision to shoot - to - kill			2
on the second day of the 2008 inquest into the @entity87 electrician 's death , information about mr @entity15 's immigration status was deleted - making the page wrongly infer he might have been an illegal immigrant			1

officers from the @entity133 collected information on 18 justice campaigns – including those concerning mr @entity15 and the @entity140 case – which resulted in ‘ collateral intrusion ’ on family members			0
the @entity21 probe also found that anonymous edits were made to the pages of schoolboy @entity35 , saying the 10 - year - old , killed in november 2000 had ' died ' , rather than ' was murdered '			2
and the death of fusilier @entity34 - who was killed by @entity149 and @entity150 near the @entity151 , @entity152 , in may last year - was deemed to be ' not notable enough ' for an article on terrorism , so the entire section on his death was deleted			2

' government takes these matters very seriously , ' the @entity158 statement said			0
