opinion has swung to the @entity2 since the last election – but @entity4 lacks the credentials to take advantage of it , a major report revealed yesterday			1
five years of austerity have pushed the mood further from the @entity11 on issues such as public spending , @entity14 , welfare and business , it showed			1
political attitudes have now returned to the same point as 2005 when @entity19 secured the last of his three election wins for @entity21			0
but the party still ' struggles to attract support ' despite the shift in the public mood , according to detailed analysis of the latest @entity27			1
the report shows @entity21 's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the @entity35 's ability to portray itself as moderate it shows that @entity21 's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the @entity35 's ability to portray itself as moderate , said the report			0
the shift to the @entity2 could also help explain the rise of the @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 , it added			2
veteran pollster @entity45 said : ' @entity4 loses more from a perception that he is not up to the job than he gains from being seen as closer to the centre ground			1
' the report 's author , dr @entity49 , said the change in attitudes presented a potential danger for the @entity35 if it campaigns hard on issues like benefits and spending cuts			1

they feed into a wider study which has tracked political attitudes since the mid- 1960s			2
dr @entity49 said the trend since 2010 was typical of that seen in the past – with public opinion moving in the opposite direction to the government of the day			0
he said : ' beginning in 1964 , the average left - right position generally tracked rightwards until 1980 , the year after @entity91 came to power			0
' the public then gradually moved left during the 1980s and remained there for the duration of the [ @entity49 ] @entity97 premiership			0
' the mood shifted rightwards from 1997 under @entity21 and then left under the @entity99			2
consequently , governing parties that achieve their party 's preferred policies cut the electoral ground from beneath their own feet – a @entity35 government that reduces spending and taxes reduces concerns about waste and regulation , while a @entity21 government that increases resources to the @entity114 and education reduces concerns about public services			0
' six weeks ago @entity21 vowed not to carry out a negative election campaign			0
yesterday it unveiled its first poster accusing the @entity120 of stripping the @entity114 to the bone			1
a @entity35 spokesman described it as ‘ fear and smear ’ tactics			0
