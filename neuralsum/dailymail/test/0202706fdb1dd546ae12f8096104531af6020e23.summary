the worry for @entity1 is obvious			1
@entity3 ’s national team have already conceded more goals in five @entity6 qualifiers than they lost in the entire qualifying campaign for the last @entity8			1
and still @entity9 never calls or writes			2
the @entity11 defender made it into two squads last year			1
but one step forward is usually followed by two steps back			2
when the @entity16 were drawing 1 - 1 with @entity17 the other night he was sunning himself in the @entity18 and bumping into club - mates instead			1
@entity1 has been in fine form for @entity11 but was n't rewarded with a call - up to the @entity3 national team @entity24 's last call - up to the @entity16 side came last year though he has never been capped by his country ‘ i saw @entity28 and @entity29 , ’ he says in deadpan fashion			1
‘ the better players were with their national teams			2
’ a holiday in @entity32 is rarely a cause of self - pity			1
yet van @entity1 ’s gripe is obvious			1
his breakthrough to the national squad was short - lived and he ca n’t shake the nagging belief that he might have a better chance of playing for his country if he performed in a more respected league than the @entity43			1
@entity11 boss @entity44 denies this , using @entity48 ’s @entity47 debut against @entity49 by way of a counter argument			1
‘ i do n’t think the @entity53 national team is any worse than the @entity16 , ’ he insists			2
‘ right now , it is better			2
so i do n’t think that is the answer			2
‘ i do n’t know the level of the other central defenders in @entity3 , but they must be very , very good to be better than @entity1 , in my opinion			1
’ @entity24 ’s rivals for @entity9 ’s attentions are @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
but they play in @entity69 , @entity70 or @entity3			1
all three leagues have a better reputation than the @entity43 and the worry for @entity11 is that @entity1 knows it			1
@entity24 says he was happy for team - mate @entity48 , who made his debut for @entity47 against @entity49 ‘ yes , i think that ’s maybe one of the big reasons , ’ says the defender			1
‘ they do n’t take the ( @entity82 ) league too serious			1
i do n’t know what the reason is , but until then i just need to keep working and hopefully get a call - up			2
‘ nobody asks the manager ( @entity9 ) or his staff either why i ’m not getting a call - up			2
for me , the only thing i can do is play well for @entity11 , work hard and prove myself day in and day out			1
‘ i ’ve watched most of the games , including the highlights from the @entity17 game last week			2
sometimes you hope you get a chance			0
but until that day will come , it ’s just for me to work hard and win games for @entity11 and prove myself			1
‘ if i ’m in the national team it would be a big bonus because it ’s only like last season that i ’ve been playing okay and i ’ve tried to continue that this season			2
if i get a call - up then great			2
’ through any disappointment he could find a silver lining in being overlooked once more			0
‘ it was a little bit disappointing when the squad was announced , ’ he concedes			0
‘ but the day i knew i was getting a week off was a better day , i think			0
‘ my feeling is i needed this break a lot			0
i ’ve never played so many games in a season as i have this year so far and the travelling is also quite hard at time , mentally			1
‘ i needed a nice break with the family away to get some rest and to be ready for friday			0
i ’ve been to @entity32 and got some nice sun and relaxation			1
’ @entity44 believes the standard of @entity82 football makes no difference to @entity3 's decision - making there is no envy of his friend and defensive partner @entity48			1
the 20 - year - old was called into the fray for @entity47 after @entity131 was sent off in midweek , playing half an hour for his homeland			1
‘ i ’m very happy for him , ’ insists @entity1			1
‘ he is a good friend of mine now and i ’m very happy he made his debut			1
it was a good day for him			0
’ whether either player will still be at @entity11 next season is impossible to say			1
@entity24 plays questions with a straight bat			0
as all footballers must , he insists he thinks little of transfer matters so long as there are trophies to play for			0
‘ i speak to my agent almost daily , ’ he reveals			0
‘ but he ’s more than an agent to me , he ’s also become a very good friend			0
‘ he knows exactly what i want and what i do n’t want to hear			0
so , we have a very good relationship and that remains that way			0
‘ i do n’t think about all that at the moment , not at all			0
i think about the @entity156			0
‘ we have one cup now and the other two are close , so i want to win both of them and write some history			0
that ’s all i ’m thinking about			0
i ’m not thinking about this is going to be my last season at the club or anything else			0
’ @entity24 leaves the field after being sent off against @entity166 in the @entity167 in february like @entity1 , his coach @entity44 also took a holiday ahead of friday night ’s clash with @entity170 in @entity171 and the final stretch of the domestic season			1
‘ i was in @entity175 for a week , 25 degrees in the sun , ’ says the @entity174			0
‘ so that was good			0
it was a good week			0
of course you are always thinking a little bit and watching the international teams , what ’s happening there , but it was a very , very good week			0
‘ i ’m ready now and looking forward to friday			0
‘ it ’s our possibility to take some days off - because during the season you play three times a week so there ’s never a chance to do anything			2
when we have international team breaks , we have 70 per cent of the squad away on duty			2
it ’s good to use those periods			0

@entity44 says it is n't *due* to standard of @entity82 football
