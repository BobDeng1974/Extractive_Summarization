by @entity0 published : 04:31 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 09:21 est , 5 october 2012 @entity2 , @entity1 designed a fairy - tale holiday home			1
but as the cross-dressing artist ’s creation resembles a gingerbread cottage clad in bottle - green tiles with a gold roof , the neighbours are not too keen			1
several bitterly objected to the proposed building on the banks of the @entity12 on the edge of @entity14 , near @entity15 , @entity16			1
the village with a sweet tooth : the proposed gingerbread house has been attacked by residents who claim it looks like something out of @entity23 ‘ i think it is completely out of keeping with our beautiful estuary – rather like @entity23 , ’ said one disgruntled local in a letter to the local authority			0
another complained : ‘ why have we got this ugly looking house or whatever you would like to call it ? ’ a third objector called it ‘ pseudo-subversive neo-kitsch ’			2
the parish council , meanwhile , was worried it ‘ does not fit in with the landscape , which is in a proposed @entity39 ’			0
but with the protesters outnumbered four to one by supporters , the story ended happily ever after for 52 - year - old @entity1 , with planning permission granted by @entity44 for his first foray into architecture			1
big ideas : @entity1 says his new project will improve the cultural standing of the area residents living in the quiet village have been left fuming after the @entity55 - winning artist was given the go - ahead to demolish the old farmhouse @entity58 and present danger : the proposal by @entity1 , seen here as his alter - ego @entity58 , has angered people in the village @entity1 , himself born in @entity65 , said the two - bedroom house , which holidaymakers will be able to rent , will tell the story of an imaginary @entity16 woman called @entity70 and ‘ relates to buildings put up as memories to loved ones , to follies , to eccentric homebuilt structures , to shrines , lighthouses and fairy tales ’			1
it will be topped with a statue of @entity70 and the walls will be clad with tiles bearing her image , a weather vane will be ‘ a celebration of her mothering skills ’ and over the front door will be a sculpture of her cat			0
a semi-derelict farmhouse currently occupies the overgrown quarter - acre plot , at the end of a single - track lane			0
it will be demolished to make way for @entity1 ’s house , which will be more than 500 yards from the nearest property			1
better known for his ceramic works , @entity1 , who won the @entity55 in 2003 and has since been a panellist on @entity103 , admitted his initial design for the house was carried out while ‘ doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television ’			2
the project was commissioned by @entity109 , a body set up by the philosopher and lateral thinker @entity113 which aims to ‘ revolutionise ’ architecture and @entity117 holiday rentals			0
the @entity1 - designed house is expected to be open for paying guests in 2014			2
how much it will cost to rent is not yet known			0
other , larger properties are advertised on @entity109 ’s website at a cost of around £ 25 per person per night .			0

@entity1 will build a green and white house with gold roof in @entity14 , @entity16
home will tell the story of *mythical* woman called @entity70
