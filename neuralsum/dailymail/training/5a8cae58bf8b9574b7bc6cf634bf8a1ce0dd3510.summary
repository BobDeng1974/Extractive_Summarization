summer bank holidays could be moved to winter to give people a day off in the run up to @entity4 , in plans touted by a government think tank in a blog on ' wellbeing and why it matters ' @entity26 , from the government 's wellbeing unit , said that a break could be good for the country , and added : ' after a few more years of data we might even consider moving a bank holiday into early winter when the nights are drawing in and we 're feeling low			1
' the paper also looked at who was happiest in their careers - with publicans , care escorts and construction workers scoring the lowest levels of satsifaction			2
it said : ' while highly - paid @entity43 and senior officials do well , take - home pay does n’t seem to be the only important factor			2
