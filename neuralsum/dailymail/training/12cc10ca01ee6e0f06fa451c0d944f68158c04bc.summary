by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 15 august 2013 rock etchings uncovered in a dried - up @entity3 lake bed dating back at least 10,000 years could be the oldest in @entity5			1
the carvings in the desert were found on boulders that formed the shoreline of @entity10 , and could even be up to 14,800 years old			1
they are believed by scientists in the @entity13 to be older than carvings in @entity15 , @entity16 that date back 7,600 years			1
ancient : these limestone boulders in northern @entity3 are covered in @entity5 's oldest etchings mysterious : because of their location they are thought to be drawn by the @entity23 but scientists are yet to confirm who carved them those carvings were preserved in ash from the @entity29 volcano eruption but have now been overtaken as @entity5 's oldest			1
later drawings usually depict weapons and animals such as spears or antelopes , but these @entity3 carvings are deeply - carved geometric designs			2
because of their location they are thought to be drawn by the @entity23 , who occupied the area 35 miles north of @entity41			0
they could even be as much as 14,800 years old , said @entity43 , the curator of anthropology at the @entity46 @entity45 and geochemist who co-wrote the paper			2
his testing shows that the limestone boulders were exposed to air between 14,800 and 13,200 years ago and then again between 11,300 and 10,500 years ago when they were above the lake 's water line			2
he used radiocarbon testing to date them and explained that even if they turned out to be the conservative estimate of only around 10,000 years old they would still be @entity5 's oldest carvings			0
@entity59 : later drawings usually depict weapons and animals such as spears or antelopes , but these consist of large , deeply carved grooves and dots complex : scientists believe the etchings may represent meteorological symbols such as clouds and lightning , and perhaps the @entity71 @entity72 , an archaeologist at the @entity73 , said that the biggest challenge is now trying to determine who carved them			0
' if you speak with @entity79 they will tell you they were made there and that is obviously their people and their artwork , ' @entity72 explained			0
' but approaching it from a scientific point of view , it is impossible to connect these to any tribal group			0

ancient geometric shapes were found in a dried - up lake in @entity3
the desert carvings could even be as much as 14,800 years old
@entity94 means etchings at @entity15 , @entity16 are no *longer* the oldest
