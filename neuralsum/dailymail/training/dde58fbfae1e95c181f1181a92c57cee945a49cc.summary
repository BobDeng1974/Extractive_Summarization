when it came to choosing the perfect ensemble for a visit to dents glove factory in @entity5 , there was one accessory the @entity7 just had to wear – a pair of dents gloves			1
ever the diplomat , @entity10 arrived at the factory , which is a short journey from @entity14 , with her hands encased in a cosy black leather pair			1
she was there to see the glove - making process in action and if she could n’t resist skating quickly past a display featuring the skins of peccary pigs used to make the gloves , it was a different story when @entity27 the dog appeared			1

@entity27 , who has been coming to the factory each day for more than a decade , joined other long - standing members of staff and , like them , was presented with a special certificate			1
@entity10 , the owner of several pet dogs herself , could n’t resist crouching down to give the dog a pat and exclaimed : ‘ how very well behaved she is ! ’ as she did so			2
thirteen - year - old @entity27 , a black @entity53 , was then given a slice of a specially made doggy cake by the @entity7 , which the pet swiftly wolfed down			0

given the factory ’s long history of producing gloves for royalty and famous names alike , it was far from being an onerous one and , as with the @entity7 herself , the accessories remain popular with the royal family – in particular , the @entity95			1
one of her majesty ’s pairs , the ones she wore to the 1953 @entity99 , were on display , as was another pair once owned by @entity102			0

after the @entity39 visited the factory , she headed over to the offices of @entity114 - a @entity5 based initiative that aims to tackle disadvantage , where she was presented with a bouquet of flowers ( left )			1
shortly before she headed into the building , @entity10 was caught up in a strong gust of wind ( right ) ever the professional , the @entity39 continued to smile as her hair was swept sideways by the blustery weather @entity63 , who was making the first of two visits in @entity5 today , certainly appeared to enjoy it and chatted animatedly as she swept through the museum , resplendent in a navy blue dress			1
inspecting a pair of gloves dating from 1507 , she expressed her amazement over the length of the fingers – a big fashion trend in the early @entity137 period			0
‘ i ca n’t get over how long they are ! ’ she said			2
another pair of gloves picked up by the @entity7 belonged to @entity105 , although in a grisly twist , they still had blood on them			0
but with another engagement to attend , @entity10 soon had to depart – this time bound for @entity147 where a visit to @entity114 ’s new offices awaited			0
