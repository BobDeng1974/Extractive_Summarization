when detectives raided @entity1 ’s home and found 450lb of cannabis resin hidden in bags , she told them : ‘ it ’s not mine – i ’m minding it for a couple days for £ 500			1
’ the 39 - year - old added that she had hidden the vast haul – which made her home in @entity18 ‘ positively hum ’ with the odour – because it would be ‘ easy money ’			1
but in an extraordinary decision , a judge allowed her to walk free from court with a suspended prison sentence			1
after hearing her 13 - year - old son would be taken into care if @entity26 went to prison – the boy ’s father is already behind bars – judge @entity31 took pity on her			1
‘ we know compassion is a dirty word , but there is still room for it , ’ he said			0
the case comes after police chiefs were criticised for quietly introducing a softer policy on illegal drug taking			0
yesterday anti-drugs campaigners criticised the sentence			0
they said it sent out the wrong message at a time of mounting fears about the health effects of super-strong ‘ skunk ’ cannabis			1
@entity26 ’s terraced house in a run - down estate in @entity54 , @entity55 , was raided in november and 2,000 blocks of cannabis were found in packages and bags			1
the total weight was 204kg ( 450lb ) with a potential street value of £ 2million , @entity4 was told			2
@entity61 , prosecuting , said the house ‘ positively hummed ’ with the odour of the cannabis			0
‘ she must have been aware of the quantity , ’ he added			0
@entity26 , who is believed to be unemployed , initially told police she was ‘ minding ’ the drugs for a man she barely knew called ‘ @entity71 ’ and for only a couple of days			0
the court heard that @entity26 was the sole carer for her 13 - year - old son , who faced being taken into care if she went to prison however the court was told that she had since admitted she was aware of the identity of the person who asked her to hide them , and a separate prosecution is understood to be in progress			1
mr @entity61 said she blamed being behind on loan repayments and financial difficulties from her son ’s father being in prison			1
‘ she said she fell to the temptation of easy money , ’ he added			0
@entity94 , defending , said @entity26 was worried about both her son and her father , who requires kidney dialysis			2
‘ she did not appreciate the scale of the offence , ’ she added			0
‘ her main concern was to provide for her son and she is greatly concerned about him having to go into care			1
’ @entity26 's suspended sentence comes after judge @entity106 let a convicted paedophile and a burglar walk free from court with suspended jail terms @entity26 , who sobbed in the dock , pleaded guilty to possessing cannabis with intent to supply			2
judge @entity31 told her : ‘ i do n’t know what you were thinking to get yourself involved			2
i presume you were under pressure and felt some loyalty			0
’ but he said he was n’t going to send her to prison , describing her as a hard - working woman who played a big part in helping her family and pointing out she had no previous convictions			1
‘ your concerns throughout have been for your son , ’ he said			2
‘ you realise now how appallingly you let him down			0
i do n’t think you will be back before the courts again			1
’ he imposed a 20 - month suspended sentence along with 120 hours ’ unpaid work			2
yesterday anti-drug campaigner @entity132 , of @entity133 , said : ‘ this sentence sends out completely the wrong message – dealers will feel nothing ’s going to happen to them			0
‘ today ’s strong varieties of cannabis lead to psychosis and violence , and i would have thought that at the very least a short , sharp shock of a jail sentence would be appropriate for possessing such a shocking amount			0
’ new drugs sentencing guidelines published last year were branded ‘ soft justice ’ after it emerged that dealers could be spared jail even if they are arrested with as much as 6kg ( 13lb ) of cannabis .			0

@entity1 , 39 , was a first - time offender who was in financial trouble
she was looking after the stash for a friend in return for £ 500
@entity18 @entity160 heard her son , 13 , faced being taken into care
judge describe her as hard - working and a big help to her family
he tells her : ' i do *n't* think you will be back before the courts again '
