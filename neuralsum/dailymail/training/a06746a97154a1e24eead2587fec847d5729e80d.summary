@entity0 will be hoping to better a record of just two wins in 14 against @entity3 in all competitions when they welcome the @entity5 to @entity6 for sunday 's vital @entity8 clash			1
neither side has enjoyed the first few months of this campaign , with both @entity11 and @entity12 under increasing pressure to get things right			0
after challenging for the title last season , a @entity0 have suffered without their talismanic @entity17 and @entity19 striker @entity18 , who has been out since the end of august with a combination of thigh and calf problems			0
@entity25 despairs after yet another home defeat by @entity3 - a 2 - 0 loss to the @entity5 in 2012 @entity28 and @entity29 look dejected after a 5 - 1 thrashing at the hands of @entity0 last season @entity32 can only look on following another fruitless trip to the @entity34 in 2012 @entity35 celebrates scoring his fourth goal in the extraordinary 4 - 4 draw at @entity6 in 2009 @entity32 celebrates after coming off the bench to help @entity0 secure a rare win in north @entity40 february 14 : @entity3 2 - 1 @entity0 ( @entity41 ) february 08 : @entity0 5 - 1 @entity0 november 13 : @entity3 2 - 0 @entity0 january 13 : @entity3 2 - 2 @entity0 september 12 : @entity0 0 - 2 @entity3 march 2012 : @entity0 1 - 2 @entity3 august 2011 : @entity3 0 - 2 @entity0 april 2011 : @entity3 1 - 1 @entity0 august 2010 : @entity0 1 - 1 @entity3 february 2010 : @entity3 1 - 0 @entity0 december 2009 : @entity0 1 - 2 @entity3 october 2009 : @entity3 2 - 1 @entity0 ( @entity42 ) april 2009 : @entity0 4 - 4 @entity3 december 2008 : @entity3 1 - 1 @entity0 the @entity5 have also stuttered so far , with fan frustration reaching boiling point			1
however , @entity6 has represented a happy hunting ground for @entity12 and his side in recent years - getting the better of some thrilling encounters			2
aside from last season 's first - half capitulation at @entity6 , @entity12 has masterminded three wins from his last four visits to @entity0 , with just one solitary defeat at the @entity34 the only blot on the copybook for the @entity55			1
that victory in august 2011 was @entity0 's first win at @entity3 in 11 years			1
helped by the dismissal of @entity60 , the @entity58 took full advantage with an @entity63 own goal and substitute @entity32 helping @entity65 's men earn a crucial three points			0
certainly the most famous clash in those 14 games was the memorable 4 - 4 draw at @entity6 , with forgotten man @entity35 grabbing all four goals as the @entity5 left it very late to snatch a dramatic point			2
the scene of one of the most dramatic moments in footballing history - @entity77 ' last minute winner which snatched the @entity79 title in 1989 will always live long in the memory			0
but determined to further avenge that encounter and numerous other more recent defeats to the @entity5 , coupled with the need for a vital three points to get their season up and running , @entity0 have plenty to spur them on when @entity3 come to town this weekend			2
sport analysts @entity89 believe a @entity0 win over @entity3 is the most likely outcome			0

@entity0 's thrashed a *hapless* @entity3 5 - 1 at @entity6 last season
but their previous home win over the @entity5 was back in 2007 - 08
@entity12 has *tasted* success seven times in those 14 matches
*improvement* against @entity101 will give @entity0 *confidence*
