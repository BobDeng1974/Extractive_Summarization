by @entity1 reporter third hand smoke , a sticky substance which stays on items in the home such as furniture and children 's toys , may be more harmful to young people - research shows third hand smoke that clings to walls and furniture could pose a more serious health threat to young children than passive smoking , a new study warns			1
researchers have found many of the 4,000 compounds in second hand smoke , which wafts through the air as a cigarette is smoked , can linger indoors long after a cigarette is stubbed out			0
these substances can react with indoor pollutants such as ozone and nitrous acid , creating brand new compounds - some of which may be carcinogenic			2
one residue - known as ' noxious residue ' - remains on virtually all surfaces , including toys and other items toddlers may put in their mouths			1
the substance - called nna - sticks to human dna and can cause uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of cancerous tumours			0
dr @entity45 , of the @entity46 , found the residue nna locks onto dna to form what is known as a ' bulky adduct ' - which is a piece of dna bound to a cancer - causing chemical			2
other large compounds that attach to @entity41 tend to cause genetic mutations			0
dr @entity45 told an @entity55 meeting in @entity56 : ' the best argument for instituting a ban on smoking indoors is actually third hand smoke			0
' the biggest potential health risk is for babies and toddlers			0
as they crawl and put their hands or toys in their mouths , they could touch , swallow or inhale compounds from third hand smoke			2
their small size and early developmental stage make them more vulnerable than adults to the effects of environmental hazards			1
although many public places prohibit smoking , dr @entity45 said people can still smoke in most rental apartments and private residences , and smoking remains a huge public health issue			0
children are at most risk from third hand smoke - which sticks to dna and can cause cancerous tumours - as , due to their small size , are more vulnerable to effects of the substance so far , the best way to get rid of third hand smoke is by removing affected items , such as sofas and carpeting , as well as sealing and repainting walls , and sometimes even replacing contaminated wallboard			1
replacing furniture can be pricey , but dr @entity45 said vacuuming and washing clothes , curtains and bedding can also help			0
however , just as it took years to establish the cancer causing effects of first hand smoke , making the connection between third hand smoke or @entity109 and cancer could take a long time			2
but early research into its nature , exposure and health effects is compelling enough a research consortium dedicated to investigating third - hand smoke was formed in @entity117 in 2010			1
that helped fund dr @entity45 's work on @entity109 induced @entity41 damage - which he said could eventually be used as biomarkers to identify people who have been exposed to third hand smoke .			1

second - hand smoke reacts with indoor pollutants to create substance
' noxious residue ' sticks to items in the home , including children 's toys
when ingested substance sticks to @entity41 in a way which can lead to cancer
particularly dangerous for children - who are more vulnerable to its effects as they are small and at a developmental stage
