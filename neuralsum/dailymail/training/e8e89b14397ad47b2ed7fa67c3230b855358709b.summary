carnage : only two of @entity4 's 50 nuclear reactors have been online since the country was struck by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake , causing a devastating tsunami , in march 2011 the quake - which claimed the lives of about 19,000 people - triggered multiple meltdowns and massive radiation leaks at the @entity9 site , which is situated about 160 miles north - east of @entity12			1
in the days and weeks following the tremor , reactors flung radioactive substances into the air , soil and sea as part of a clean - up operation			0
since then , the power station has been beset with power outages and other problems			0
this had led outside experts to question whether @entity23 is qualified to handle the cleanup , which is unprecedented due to the amount of radioactive material on the site and its coastal location			0
earlier this year , the company lost power to cool spent uranium fuel rods at the plant after a rat tripped an electrical wire			0
and just last month , @entity23 employees found that 430 litres of highly radioactive water had leaked from one of the hastily built storage tanks .			0
