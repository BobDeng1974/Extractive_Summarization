by @entity0 former @entity2 @entity1 has denied speculation he was forced to stand down in a letter , calling the claims ' absurd ' retired pope @entity1 has denied speculation that he was pressured to resign , saying the decision was made by him and him alone			1
in a letter to @entity11 newspaper @entity1 called speculation he had been forced from his post ' absurd ' ahead of the first anniversary of the resignation on friday			1
the @entity17 @entity16 has also fended off allegations that he is still active within the church , leading a faction of the @entity21 who are unhappy with pope @entity24 's sweeping new reforms			2
@entity1 announced his decision to resign on feb. 11 , 2013 and formally stepped down on feb. 28 , becoming the first pope in 600 years to do so			2
two weeks later , @entity24 was elected the first @entity28 pope in 1,300 years			2
@entity1 said at the time that he was stepping down because he no longer had the physical and spiritual strength to run the 1.2 billion member @entity31 and that his decision had been taken in full freedom			0
at the time he promised to live a cloistered life ‘ hidden from the world ’ and has not spoken in public since			0
however , some @entity38 watchers claim that his resignation was not ' valid ' a situation and that @entity1 continues to lead as a ‘ shadow ’ @entity2			1
@entity1 has kept his papal name , lives in the @entity38 and continues to wear pontifical white , though he says this is because there were ' no other clothes available ' when he stood down			1
earlier this month @entity47 newspaper @entity46 ran a long story reviving speculation that @entity1 may have been forced to resign because of scandals in the @entity38			1
in 2012 , @entity1 's butler was arrested for leaking sensitive documents alleging corruption among @entity38 prelates and irregularities in @entity38 finances			1
the @entity17 @entity16 has also denied speculation he is still governing as a ' shadow ' leader despite still living in the @entity38 , using his papal name and wearing white @entity47 media at the time reported that a faction of prelates who wanted to discredit @entity1 and pressure him to resign was behind the leaks			1
the @entity38 has always denied this			0
@entity67 also suggested that @entity1 chose to continue to wear white because he still felt like he was a pope			2
@entity1 , who lives in near - total isolation inside a former convent on the @entity38 grounds , was also asked about this and responded : in an interview earlier this month , @entity1 's personal secretary , archbishop @entity73 , said the former pope saw his main function now as helping the @entity31 and his successor through prayer			1
@entity1 has responded to a few letters in the past year and has appeared in public only a handful of times			0
the latest was last saturday when he attended a ceremony in @entity84 when @entity24 created new cardinals			0
in his letter he wrote : ' there is absolutely no doubt regarding the validity of my resignation from the @entity93 ministry			0
' the only condition for the validity of my resignation is the complete freedom of my decision			0
speculations regarding its validity are simply absurd			0
' pope @entity24 was elected as the first @entity2 in 1,300 years following @entity1 's resignation on saturday there were visibly shocked faces when @entity1 left his monastic home to attend a ceremony creating nineteen new cardinals			1
' as the anniversary of his resignation approaches , some have suggested that @entity1 ’s resignation may have lacked validity and that he is therefore still playing an active and institutional role beside the reigning @entity2 , ' veteran @entity38 journalist @entity108 explained			1
the @entity24 @entity16 also sought to justify his continued use of his papal name and clothing , writing in the letter to newspaper @entity11 : ' i continue to wear the white cassock and kept the name @entity1 for purely practical reasons			1
' at the moment of my resignation there were no other clothes available			0
in any case , i wear the white cassock in a visibly different way to how the @entity2 wears it			2
this is another case of completely unfounded speculations being made			0
' @entity1 caused shockwaves around the globe when he announced his plan to step down on 11 february 2013 , telling cardinals : ' i have come to the certainty that my strengths , due to an advanced age , are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the @entity93 ministry			0
' it took effect on 28 february when the cardinals met to begin the process of electing his successor , @entity24 .			0

friday marks the first anniversary of former @entity24 @entity1 's resignation
@entity47 newspapers have speculated he was forced to stand down
they also *accuse* him of governing as a ' shadow ' leader because he still lives in the @entity38 , uses his papal name and wears a white cassock
he has called the allegations ' absurd ' and *defended* his use of the cassock , saying there were ' no other clothes available ' when he resigned
