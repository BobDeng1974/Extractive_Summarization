click here to read @entity2 's full match report from @entity3 @entity4 should consider dropping @entity5 and continue using @entity6 and @entity7 as their midfield ' template ' for playing in @entity10 , according to @entity11			1
the @entity13 champions progressed to the last 16 of the @entity14 with an organised and disciplined 2 - 0 defeat of @entity16 at the @entity17 - with @entity18 and @entity19 netting the decisive goals			1
as @entity22 's @entity21 noted ' it was n't pretty ' , but it was effective and fellow @entity24 pundit @entity11 believes that fielding a more defensive - minded partnership in midfield should be how @entity27 sets his side up in the future			1
@entity7 ( front ) and @entity6 ( back ) gave @entity4 stability in their 2 - 0 defeat of @entity16 @entity6 helped provide a shield in front of defence to give @entity4 their first @entity38 clean sheet this season @entity7 congratulates @entity18 ( right ) after the @entity39 opened the scoring suspended midfielder @entity5 can leave the midfield exposed , says @entity24 pundit @entity11 click here to read the @entity43 for both teams ' the two central midfield players ( @entity6 and @entity7 ) played as a pair			1
' when @entity5 plays he 's a game changer and a goal scorer , but his defensive play can be easily played around - we 've seen that in the @entity13 and in @entity38 games			1
' tonight for the first time we 've seen @entity4 play as a pair in midfield			2
in terms of moving forward that might be a template of how to play in @entity10 - it 's a question for @entity27			2
' ' if @entity4 play their best @entity13 team - that 's @entity60 and @entity61 up front , @entity62 and @entity18 out wide , and @entity5 as part of the midfield - you can not play that way in @entity10 because @entity18 and @entity62 do not play defensively			1
' what @entity67 and @entity68 have given them tonight in wide positions is legs to attach themselves to the two in midfield ( @entity7 and @entity6 )			2

' if you play your best players , you do n't necessarily play your best team			0
this should be the template for them moving forward			0
' you do n't necessarily leave them all out , but you cant fit them all in			0
if you go away to @entity98 you cant play with @entity62 , @entity18 , @entity61 , @entity60 and @entity5 in the same side			0
' @entity21 also praised the stability brought to the side by playing the two @entity102 in midfield together			2
' it was an excellent @entity38 performance and it comes on the back of a lot of big players missing , ' he said			0
' @entity6 and @entity7 , those two did a proper job shielding the defence and that is part of the reason @entity4 got their first clean sheet from the group stages			1
' @entity27 should consider playing more cautiously in @entity10 , especially against the leading teams city stars celebrate after securing their passage into the last 16 of the @entity14 former @entity119 midfielder @entity118 agreed that @entity4 need to approach @entity38 games with more caution			1
' it was a really solid euro performance and there 's no magic to it			0
city have been a wee bit too adventurous in the past			0
show teams more respect in the early part of games - if it pans out the way you want then leave it , if it does n't then make changes , ' he said			0
' most football people would have seen that and thought that 's the way they should have gone in big @entity38 games			0
