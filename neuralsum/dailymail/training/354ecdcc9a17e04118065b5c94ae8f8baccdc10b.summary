by @entity0 the boss of the @entity2 has said he will be ‘ disappointed ’ if nursing homes still exist in 50 years ’ time			1
@entity4 , chief executive of @entity5 , said that he believes better community care and advances in dementia research can be used to help people stay in their homes			1
it follows public concern about the treatment of the elderly in some care homes in recent years			1
care homes will come to be seen as a quirk of the health service at the end of the last century , @entity4 argued mr @entity0 likened the concept of care homes to @entity23 beds , where patients were consigned on wards to be treated with the deadly disease			1
a combination of technology , more social support and family help means care homes will become seen as a ' particular feature ' of the end of the last century			1
speaking at @entity34 ’s for later life conference he said : ‘ we need to do a better job of keeping out of care homes			1
each year about 90,000 people who live at home are admitted to hospital and then are discharged to a care home			1
‘ some of those folks clearly will need to be supported in a care home , but probably many could be supported at home			0
‘ it would be a disappointment if in 30 , 40 or 50 years ’ time nursing homes still exist			2
i think we may find that nursing homes are a bit like @entity23 beds were , they were particularly feature of the way care was provided in the latter part of the 20th century			1
‘ the combination of team - working , technology , and better social support , i hope means that they go the same way over time			0
‘ when you think about where we are trying to get to with the treating and preventing of @entity63 ’s , it is perfectly imaginable that in 50 years ’ time we have a world where there is very little in the way of @entity63 ’s			0
there is a huge research effort internationally			0
’ mr @entity0 ( right ) , who took up his role as chief executive of @entity5 earlier this year , called for new ways of looking after people at home mr @entity0 , who took up his role earlier this year , added : ‘ we need to think about new ways of supporting people at home			1
' we know that the vast majority of people would prefer to be supported in their own homes for as long as possible and continue to be an active part of their communities			2
' but often the trend has been pushing in the opposite direction			0
‘ something is not working right about how we are providing community nursing and primary care for people at home and the consequence of that is people finding themselves admitted to hospital when we could otherwise avoid that			1
’ mr @entity0 added that he wanted the term ‘ bed blocker ’ to be banned in the @entity2			2
he said : ‘ we ’ve got to tackle ageism			0
we need to think about the labels that used			0
the idea that somebody that is stuck in a hospital bed waiting to get home is described as a bed - blocker is offensive and should end			0
’ in future patients will be treated closer to where they live , he argued			0
‘ the @entity2 of the future will be one where more support for frail older patients is provided locally , but where for really major conditions , patients get quick access to centres of excellence			2
we need both , not either / or			0
‘ this reminds us that healthcare is constantly changing and the @entity2 needs to adapt with it			2
sometimes we need to centralise in order to save lives , at other times we need to make services more local to meet the needs of patients			0

@entity4 says he would be ' disappointed ' if they still exist by 2060
@entity5 chief executive wants people looked after in the community
@entity132 care homes to @entity23 beds , a quirk of the @entity2 in the late 20th century
