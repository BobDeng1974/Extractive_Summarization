by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 04:24 est , 9 october 2012 one of @entity4 ’s largest energy providers is preparing to raise prices during the depths of winter , it was feared last night			1
@entity8 - owned @entity7 , which provides power to 5million households across the @entity4 , has pledged not to increase tariffs before december 31			1
but consumer groups yesterday said they suspected the company was planning to introduce inflation - busting increases immediately after the deadline expires on january 1			1
feeling the chill : gas price rises could hit the most vulnerable , including the elderly and poor this would lock families into paying higher rates to heat their homes just as the coldest months of the year start to bite			0
industry insiders warn that it is inevitable that all of the major providers – @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity7 , @entity30 and @entity31 – will increase prices either before or during winter			1
this would leave almost every family in @entity4 facing higher tariffs at a time when household incomes are being squeezed by soaring food prices and savings are being eaten away by inflation			1
a sharp and sudden rise in bills could push millions more into fuel poverty – where they face the nightmare choice between heating and eating – while more cash pours into the coffers of the energy companies			1
the @entity51 all faced criticism from consumer groups last autumn for raising tariffs and then dropping them again in the spring			1
it now appears the same pattern could be repeated this year – further increasing suspicions that @entity4 energy providers act as a cartel			1
next week @entity60 owner @entity29 will increase rates by 9 per cent – the first company to raise tariffs as winter approaches			1
@entity27 has also warned it may have to increase bills by an average of £ 130 before winter – which would take the average family ’s dual fuel bill to a record high of around £ 1,400			1
soaring prices : consumer groups suspect @entity8 - owned @entity7 is preparing to hike gas bills during the depths of winter only last week a report from energy regulator @entity74 laid bare the @entity4 ’s desperate energy needs and said the country could face 1970s - style blackouts in three years			1
experts said household bills will double by 2015 because of the energy shortages which are being heaped on the @entity4 because of green laws passed by the @entity82			2
@entity7 is currently the only firm which has promised not to increase rates during 2012 – a pledge it made in may to try and win over new customers			2
but the group , which last year bumped up its prices by 11 per cent for electricity and 18 per cent for gas , has so far refused to extend the guarantee into 2013			0
consumer champion @entity91 , from @entity92 , said he expected a rise early in january			2
‘ what usually happens , a very short time after the pledge ends , is the prices jump , ’ he said			0
he said he was willing to bet that the group would raise bills or announce an increase in january			0
he said that price guarantees , such as the one offered by @entity7 , ‘ give customers a false sense of security , even more so if they encourage people to switch to a provider offering one ’			2
mr @entity91 added : ‘ the promise is “ no price hikes this year ”			0
so technically , it could announce a hike in november to start on 1 january			2
january and february are the coldest months of the year , but the price promise does not extend to then			0
‘ most people who switch stay with that provider for years , so the few months of price holds is of limited impact			0
’ warning : other energy giants , including @entity27 , could follow any rivals ' price increases with its own hike under industry regulations , energy companies need to give 30 days ’ notice of price rises			1
this means the earliest another rise could come into force is november			0
mr @entity91 called for every energy company to promise not to increase prices in the first six months of a customer contract			0
@entity7 boasts on the front page of its website : ‘ we stand by our promise not to increase home energy prices in 2012 ’			2
but a spokesman for the energy giant yesterday said : ‘ our price promise runs until the end of the year			0
‘ while we do everything we can to help our customers , we ca n’t guarantee that we will extend this			0
‘ we are not ruling anything in or out at the moment			0

@entity8 - owned @entity7 could be planning an inflation - busting hike during winter for its five million @entity4 customers
fears mount other energy providers could follow suit - confronting nearly every family with sharp rise
@entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity7 , @entity30 and @entity31 have all faced criticism for raising tariffs and then dropping them again in the spring
