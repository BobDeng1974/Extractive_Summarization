by @entity0 published : 13:14 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 10 november 2013 demands : @entity2 called for a ban on payday loans companies targeting children @entity2 wants to ban payday loan firms from screening cartoon - like commercials during children 's television programmes			1
the @entity11 leader has threatened to outlaw the ads during the shows if negotiations with the advertising watchdog fail			1
he also wants the firms stopped from plugging their expensive loans with cartoon characters such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
mr @entity2 said young viewers were being used as a tool by the payday loan industry and added : ' kids should n't be given the impression payday lending offers easy money without consequences			1
' his comments came after consumer champion @entity30 of @entity32 warned that payday lenders were ' grooming ' youngsters by exposing them to adverts on short - term loans			1
mr @entity2 said he worried when ' pay day lenders target our kids and young people '			1
' how else do we explain hundreds of thousands of pounds being spent by payday lenders for adverts during children 's tv programmes			1
and why else are they using cartoon characters , trendy puppets or cute plasticine figures in some of their ads ? ' he said			1
advertising was rubbing off on youngsters : a survey found one in seven parents were told to take out a payday loan by their children when they refused to buy them something			0
mr @entity2 called for payday loan firms to be treated the same as junk food or gambling ventures - which are banned by the @entity62 from running ads during children 's programmes			0
the next @entity11 government will ask the watchdog to ban irresponsible advertising of the loans - which charge rates of up to 6,000 per cent a year - that targets youngsters			1
' if this can not be done through the advertising watchdog , we will do it through legislation , ' he said			0
mr @entity2 also criticised the payday lender @entity76 for launching a glossy film last week which painted the firm as ' a cross between an essential public service and a fairy godmother '			0
seven out of ten people who took out the supposedly short term loans regretted it , mr @entity2 said			2
@entity11 has said it would cap the total cost of credit of payday loans - going further than the coalition government which has ruled out a limit on the interest rates charged			1
mr @entity30 welcomed the move			0
' we 've been calling for a ban on payday loans on children 's tv			1
the risk is they effectively groom a new generation of children , normalising , legitimising and mainstreaming this dangerous type of niche borrowing , ' he told the @entity124 on sunday			0
' marketing is at the core of these loans , which cause many people pain and misery			2
' they 're slick , fast , efficient technological plays , the crack cocaine of lending that have created a market that did n't really exist five years ago - and sadly our lack of regulation means they thrive here while other countries have far more effective controls			2
' a survey of parents conducted by @entity32 found that 30 per cent of children under 10 were repeating advertising slogans from payday loan ads. a spokeswoman for the @entity148 said the government was already cracking down on irresponsible payday lenders to protect consumers			0
she said : ' two misleading payday loan adverts have been banned over the past six months as part of our work with the @entity62			2
' new rules will also force payday loan adverts to include risk warnings and information about where the public can access free and confidential debt advice			2
' new powers have been introduced to ban products , impose unlimited fines and order firms to refund consumers			2
' these new restrictions build on the action taken by the @entity169 which has seen 25 payday lenders leave the market since march			0
' the @entity172 , which represents the payday industry , denied children were being targeted			0
its chief executive , @entity175 said : ' @entity30 's suggestion that responsible , legal businesses are advertising to children is absurd			0
@entity172 members do not target any specific group of people - certainly not children			0
' the industry is under investigation by the @entity183 .			0

@entity11 leader said he would ban the cutesy adverts if he wins next *election*
he said kids should n't be *taught* loans offer ' money without consequences '
comes after consumer groups *attacked* the adverts , which use characters such as @entity19 and @entity198
