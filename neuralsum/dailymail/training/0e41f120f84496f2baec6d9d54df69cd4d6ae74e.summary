police tried to call him down but he fell from the property in @entity18 , @entity19 , an hour later , the hearing was told			1
@entity21 heard dr @entity1 - who was also a qualified engineer and was described as a ' high academic achiever ' - had suffered a number of career knock - backs in the weeks leading to his death			1
his landlord of seven years @entity27 said the most recent he knew of was in december last year			2
in a statement read to the inquest mr @entity27 said : ' i was aware @entity1 had started a job with @entity32 - i think in a call centre - which was n't what he aspired to			1
' he mentioned being frustrated at work and unhappy about being there and had started looking for other jobs and going for interviews			0
' the last one was the week before @entity40 in 2012			0
' i saw him ironing his shirt getting ready for the interview			0
' while i was there he checked his emails and he had one which said the interview had been cancelled			0
' he was a bit low about that , but he was n't angry			0
he said that he would plod on and keep going			0
' the landlord said he received a text message from dr @entity52 on january 24 , three days before his death , apologising for not doing some tidying up			2
it read : ' sorry			0
i 've had a terrible time the last three weeks			2
i ca n't explain how stressful it 's been , but i appreciate it 's not your fault			0
' mr @entity27 said him and his wife @entity62 were ' utterly shocked ' to hear @entity1 had taken his life days later			2
low : the coroner could not say for certain if dr @entity1 meant to take his own life and said his actions could have been a ' cry for help ' det con @entity69 , of the @entity70 , said a resident in the block where dr @entity1 died reported hearing footsteps on the roof at 9.30am that morning , but thought nothing of it and went back to bed			1
an hour - and - a - half later a motorist driving past the building called police expressing concern a man might be preparing to jump			2
officers arrived within five minutes but were advised not to talk him down as it was too dangerous to get out onto the scaffolding			0
paramedics who were already on the scene tried to revive him but the science mad graduate was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at 12.10pm			0
@entity92 coroner @entity91 said he could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that dr @entity1 meant to take his own life as it could have been a ' cry for help			1
' recording a narrative verdict , he explained : ' it is clear he was a high academic achiever in science , having achieved a phd from the @entity12 , but he had not been able to get a job for some time			2
dr @entity1 was seen on the sixth floor of this apartment block in west @entity15 on january 27 before he fell , @entity21 heard ( pictured ) ' he took work which was perhaps not entirely suited to his skill sets in that he was working in a call centre			1
' however , it shows dr @entity106 was committed to gaining employment and to progressing in his life			2
' what is clear from the evidence is that he received a number of blows to his confidence in terms of jobs he aspired to which were either unsuccessful or withdrawn			0
' it is clear that this had an impact on his general morale , and on the 27th of january 2013 dr @entity1 climbed up on to some scaffolding in @entity121 , @entity19			1
' officers decided not to try and talk dr @entity1 down as it would have been dangerous to them and to him			1
' sadly , shortly thereafter , dr @entity1 made a gesture with his arms and appeared to dive towards the ground striking the pavement			1
' he added : ' police enquiries revealed no indication dr @entity1 's actions were planned or that he had intended to take his life , nor is there any evidence to suggest dr @entity1 was subject to any mental health care			1
' whilst perhaps disappointed and suffering from a degree of depression due to his lack of work opportunities he was otherwise a fit , intelligent young man who had achieved well at university			0
' it makes the outcome of what occurred on january 27 2013 all the sadder due to that			0
' i am not satisfied on what has been presented before me as to be certain dr @entity1 intended to take his own			1
it is entirely possible this could have been a cry for help			0
' none of dr @entity1 's family attended the inquest in central @entity15 , but they have since set up a remembrance page in his memory .			1
