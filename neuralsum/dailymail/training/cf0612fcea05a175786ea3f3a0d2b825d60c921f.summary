when @entity1 made it to the finish line of the triathlon at @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , it was the the final victory in a a fight for life that began in that very town three years earlier			1
for in the same chilly @entity12 waters that the 26 - year - old raced rival athletes , he had in 2011 broken his neck after diving from a 15ft pier into water just 3 feet deep			1
but that was just the start of a journey that saw him cheat death eight times and fight his way back from what doctors told him would be a lifetime of paralysis			2
you saved my life : @entity1 meets @entity31 for the first time since she resuscitated him eight times after he leapt from a 15ft pier into just three feet of water and broke his neck in @entity5 , @entity6 ' i am incredibly proud that i got back here ' : mr @entity1 and ms @entity31 were introduced as they prepared for the swimming leg of a triathlon in the very same waters where he nearly lost his life three years ago mr @entity1 spent five weeks in a coma after the accident , only to contract @entity44 in the hospital then develop pneumonia			1
doctors told him he would never walk again			2
then , after being sent home he was struck down by testicular cancer and only got the all clear after his right testicle was removed			2
incredibly , not only did he fight his way back from paralysis , and overcome his cancer , he has regained a level of fitness that most people who have never felt the sharp end of a surgeon 's scalpel would envy			2
mr @entity1 participating in the @entity60 at the @entity5 triathlon : mr @entity62 completed his 350m swim and 5km run in one hour and 25 minutes but dropped out of the cycle leg after his bike did n't arrive in time lifesavers : @entity69 and her husband @entity70 , who were just 10m away when mr @entity1 had his accident			1
their calls for help drew the attention of ms @entity31 who gave him cpr to keep his heart beating the triumphant return to @entity5 brought mr @entity1 face to face with the lifesavers who helped bring him back from the brink four times within 30 minutes when his heart failed and water filled his lungs			1
he met @entity69 and her husband @entity70 , who were only 10 metres away when he took his life - changing dive			2
their calls for help drew the attention of @entity31 , 41 , who gave mr @entity90 after rushing to the scene			1
mr @entity1 and ms @entity31 had not met until they were introduced as they stood side - by - side on the beach preparing for the gruelling swim			1
mr @entity1 in hospital after he broke his neck : he contracted @entity44 , then pneumonia while being treated			1
after his discharge , he was then struck down by cancer and only got the all - clear after his testicle was removed mr @entity1 during his rehabilitation : doctors said he might never walk again , let alone complete a triathlon invincible : mr @entity1 , from @entity109 in @entity110 , during his recovery after he survived a broken neck , a heart attack , near drowning , paralysis , @entity44 , pneumonia and testicular cancer ms @entity31 , a nurse in @entity118 's @entity117 who was visiting her boyfriend on the day of the accident , told mr @entity1 : ' your heart stopped down on the beach and we worked on you			1
' we got you back to a faint heart rate , and it stopped again and we got you back again			0
we were determined we were going to hold on to you			0
i am delighted you do n't remember any of it			0
' you did cause a bit of trouble along the way			0
your heart was very unstable			0
your blood - sugar was down			0
' i am so glad you do n't remember any of it			0
but you ruined a week of my life i was so upset with what happened to you			0
' where it all began : mr @entity1 stands at the spot where he broke his neck in june 2011 mr @entity1 completed his 350m swim and 5km run in one hour and 25 minutes			1
he was forced to drop out of the bike ride after his mountain bike did not arrive from his home in @entity109 , @entity110 , in time			0
after the event on saturday , mr @entity1 also walked down to the spot where he fell			1
the low tide revealed that instead of falling on rocks , as he originally thought , he had in fact smashed into sand			0
mr @entity1 said : ' i feel quite emotional in a really good way			1
i have shed a tear or two			0
i am incredibly proud that i got back here to take part in the triathlon within three years			2
' for @entity31 , who was resuscitating me the last time she saw me , to see me doing as well as i am makes me intensely proud of what i have done			0
