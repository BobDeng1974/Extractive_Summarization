scientists have discovered that throat singers such as the late @entity2 , have differently shaped vocal cords that allow them to make the deep hum if you try to emulate the strange low songs of throat singers from @entity8 , you will probably be disappointed			1
scientists have discovered that the uniquely shaped vocal cords of people living in the @entity12 mountain region in southern @entity8 means that only they can perform the eerie melodies composed centuries ago , which have been passed down generations			1
the distinctive noise comprising a low hum with several higher notes sounded simultaneously , has featured in a song by @entity19 , but has n't popularly spread beyond the regions because only the people of southern @entity8 and @entity22 can make it			1
scientists from the @entity26 of the @entity27 have discovered that native @entity28 have different vocal cords so only they can master the melodies , @entity24 reported			2
their cords are slightly wider , with a shorter voice box , allowing natives to make the unique noise , which comes deep within the throat			1
throat singers have been likened to ‘ human bagpipes ’ and can sing a long , low note , while making higher whistling notes and rhythm			2
the study suggests that people in @entity43 , for example , are unable to make the noises because of their differently shaped throats			1
it 's believed that @entity48 men used songs to communicate across the vast , rugged landscape			1
they used natural features like mountains to ensure their voices carried long distances			0
now experts think that the way the notes were sung gradually altered the structure of people ’s throats in the region			0
the researchers also studied the speech of two residents in @entity66 who speak @entity67 , which is spoken by around 2,800 people in south central @entity8 and borrows many of its roots from @entity48			2
they used digital radiography and mri scans to study the vocal apparatus and the brain			0
the research took place in the laboratory of experimental phonetic studies , which , since its creation in the 1960s , has been used to describe the sound and features of more than 40 languages and dialects			0
@entity48 throat singing is a particular variant of overtone singing practiced by people in @entity48 and @entity22			2
it was added to the list of @entity93 of @entity94 in 2009			0
throat singers make one or more pitches sounded simultaneously over a base note - producing a unique sound			1
it is not known when the practice originated , but it thought to have passed down generations of male herders for hundreds of years			0
now women are using the technique too			0
the open landscape of @entity48 and southern @entity8 allows the sounds to carry a great distance			1
it 's thought human mimicry of nature 's sounds is also at the root of throat singing .			0

people living in the @entity12 mountain region in southern @entity8 have differently shaped vocal cords and voice boxes , a study has revealed
unique *physiology* means they can be throat singers , and make a low hum
singing technique passed down generations has featured in a @entity19 song
it was used by @entity48 men to communicate across vast spaces
