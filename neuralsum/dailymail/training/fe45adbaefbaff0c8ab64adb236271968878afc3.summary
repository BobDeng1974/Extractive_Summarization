by @entity0 one of the most captivating sights on @entity2 is the night sky , with its dazzling stars , meteor showers and glowing galaxies			0

if you look up at the sky tonight , chances are you wo n’t see much			0
the reality is the stars are disappearing			0
around 90 per cent of the country resembles a blank orange canvas dotted with a few hazy stars and planets			0
these detailed night time aerial photographs show how much light is wasted in a @entity21 city			1
the incredible snaps were taken by @entity23 over @entity24 during the last two weeks the culprit is bad lighting , dumped upwards into the sky by our cities ’ shops , gardens , homes and streets			2
these incredible images reveal , in unprecedented detail , exactly how much light is being wasting in a @entity21 city			1
the snaps were taken over two weeks in @entity24 , which is home to @entity40			0
captured by @entity23 using a camera with thermal imaging sensors , the pictures show how bright the city looks from the night sky			2

captured using a camera with thermal imaging sensors , the image shows the impact of light pollution on our skies pictured is an aerial view of @entity24 by day			1
the city in home to the @entity40 with scientists carry out research into stars and planets in our night sky inefficient lighting wastes over £ 1 billion a year in the @entity21 alone , according to the @entity64 's @entity63			1
today light pollutions means that around 90 per cent of the country resembles a blank orange canvas dotted with a few hazy stars and planets			2
as well as masking the view of the night sky , light pollution has also been blamed for disrupting the migration of birds , the breeding patterns of nocturnal animals and insect populations			2
one picture shows the whole of the city centre surrounded by the ring - road which appears as a glowing yellow circle			1
other images show the lit - up @entity85 shopping centre as well as the railway station and a giant oval car park near to where the remains of @entity89 were discovered			1
the photos illustrate the difference between modern and old - fashioned lighting - with the new led lamps showing up as a brighter white light whereas the older gas - based ones are visible as an orange glow			1

research has shown it disrupts people 's sleep patterns , while one study light at night can disrupt the body 's production of the brain hormone melatonin , which in turn increases the risk of developing breast cancer			2

as well as masking the view of the night sky , inefficient lighting wastes over £ 1 billion a year in the @entity21 alone @entity23 , who captured the images , have digitally matched them to street maps and branded their project ‘ the world 's first integrated night mapping system ’			1
the company , which provides @entity133 with their aerial images , now plan to role the night - time images out to other @entity21 cities			2
they also hope to work with @entity137 and use the pictures to produce data to help combat light pollution , energy wastage and managed urban habitats			1

¿ by integrating a camera , specially adapted to cope with the challenges of night time surveying , within our @entity150 aerial mapping system we can ensure high levels of positional accuracy for the night time images , ' said @entity154 , technical director at @entity23 @entity156 car park in @entity24 is pictured here at night , shining as bright beacon @entity23 have digitally matched the images to street maps , such as this one showing @entity156 car park			1
the department store , which shines brightly at night , opened in september 2008 as part of the @entity85 redevelopment with a population of 280000 , @entity24 is the largest city in the @entity166 and the tenth largest in the country ‘ light pollution impacts all of us in many ways from a loss of view of the night sky to health problems caused by lack of sleep , ’ said @entity154 , technical director at @entity23			1
‘ intrusion of light into a bird or animals habitat can affect breeding or feeding patterns causing a threat to our urban wildlife , while inefficient or ineffective street lighting can impact crime patterns and costs money through wasted electricity			2

‘ we are looking at how much light has been wasted			0
‘ if the street lights can be seen from as high up as the plan then they are obviously too bright and wasting energy			0
‘ the plan is to do more cities ; we 've had a lot of interest from other local authorities already			0
