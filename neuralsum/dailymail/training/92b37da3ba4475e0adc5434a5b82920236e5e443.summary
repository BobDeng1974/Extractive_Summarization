by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 07:48 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 21:43 est , 13 november 2012 unnecessary signs which clutter up the roads are to be scrapped			1
they are an ugly , confusing and potentially dangerous blot on the landscape , transport secretary @entity5 said yesterday			1
his promise to sweep them away was welcomed by the @entity11 and motoring groups including the @entity13			0
the @entity11 said the focus until now had been on the forest of road signs in urban areas , but the countryside was also being blighted			1
motoring groups have welcomed plans to rid @entity21 roadsides of unnecessary signs transport secretary @entity5 will warn that some signs are actually making driving more dangerous			1
here are several contradictory and confusing signs on a road in @entity26 ridiculous examples spotted include signs declaring @entity29 and @entity30 closed to ease congestion			1
mr @entity5 , who was speaking at a conference in @entity33 organised by the @entity11 , said : ‘ too many country roads carry a reminder of how insensitive planners can be to aesthetics			1
‘ ugly and unnecessary signs clutter up the network			2
new signs seem to sprout like weeds , without any apparent consideration of what ’s already there			1
often what we ’re left with is not just a blot on the landscape			0
it ’s confusing and potentially dangerous too			0
‘ there are those ‘ ‘ temporary ’ ’ yellow signs saying @entity52 that are left to rot for years			2
near me in @entity54 there ’s an ugly big sign by a beautiful medieval church that just says : no footpath			0
it ’s on a small country lane			0
of course there is n’t a path			0
we do n’t need a huge sign to tell us that			0
so i ’m determined to do more to sort this out			0
’ ministers want an end to duplicate , unnecessary signs and those which give drivers conflicting or confusing information mr @entity5 said a @entity72 review last year had relaxed rules that used to insist on two signs by the road when one would do			1
now it was working on revised traffic signs regulations			2
he insisted : ‘ the combined effect of these changes will be to give authorities and designers much greater freedom to simplify and use fewer signs at country junctions			1
‘ and i want to make sure that they use it			2
so my message to highways engineers is : if in doubt , do n’t do it			0
save your money for something that really matters			0
’ the campaign to @entity95 says there is no need for two signs pointing towards @entity99 when the historic site is clearly visible from the @entity101 examples of confusing signs include this one , when the sign appears to contradict the road ahead a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ signage clutter builds up over time without anyone taking responsibility for removing unnecessary signs			1
not only does it disfigure the countryside , it also distracts drivers and entails long - term maintenance costs			2
’ @entity13 spokesman @entity116 said : ‘ this is long overdue			0
there ’s far too much clutter and it needs tackling			0
’ mr @entity5 also said the government was committed to pressing on with the controversial £ 32billion @entity123 high - speed rail plan from @entity33 to the @entity124 and onwards to the @entity125 despite widespread opposition			1
but to mitigate any disruption to rural dwellers on the route he said an independent design panel of experts in architecture , engineering , town planning and transport will look at areas of concern such as stations , bridges and viaducts .			2

transport secretary @entity5 claims new signs ' spring up like weeds '
too much information - which is often contradictory - could make *accidents* more likely
campaign to @entity95 wants new rules to make it easier to have fewer , smaller signs
