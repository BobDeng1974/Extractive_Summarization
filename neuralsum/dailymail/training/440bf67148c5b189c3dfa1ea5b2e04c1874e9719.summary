the cold - blooded outrage in @entity1 is not a story about one magazine or one country – and it is not just about @entity6			1
it is about the right of every single one of us to be free to express ourselves			2
and it is high time the nations of @entity13 woke up to how gravely that right is under threat			2
because what happened yesterday – though the most appalling incident of its kind yet – is in many ways far from unprecedented			2
it is just the latest chapter in a long , concerted campaign to shut down criticism and discussion of one religion , its founder and its teachings			1
above , the gunmen kill a police officer challenge : the aim of the campaign is to place that religion – @entity37 – above the level of all other religions or ideas and make it immune from criticism			1
above , two armed men flee the scene after the attack this morning the aim of the campaign is to place that religion – @entity37 – above the level of all other religions or ideas and make it immune from criticism			1
and the tactic is working			2
this campaign has been gathering pace for at least 25 years			1
it really started in the @entity55 in 1989 after the publication of @entity58 ’s novel @entity59 , which contained passages considered deeply offensive by some @entity61			1
the novel resulted in @entity63 of @entity64 issuing a fatwa – a religious judgment , in this case a death sentence – on @entity58 that forced the author into hiding			1
though @entity58 survived , the fatwa was followed by the murder of a translator of his works and knife attacks on two others			1
then , as now , some people claimed that @entity58 had been deliberately provocative			1
then , as now , even if that were the case it would matter not a jot			2
no society can be considered truly free if its members are terrorised into silence and hiding by fatwas and mortal threats			2
even so , ever since the @entity58 affair , most authors , artists and publishers have avoided producing anything that might stoke the ire of fundamentalist @entity61			1
of course it is important to state that the great majority of @entity61 are peaceful , law - abiding citizens , who abhor violence			2
indeed yesterday @entity61 leaders in @entity98 were among the first to condemn the @entity1 atrocity			1
threats : the campaign began after the publication of @entity58 ’s novel @entity59 , which contained passages considered deeply offensive by some @entity61			1
the author , above , was forced into hiding nevertheless , there have been a very troubling number of attacks carried out in the name of @entity37 on those in the @entity55 considered to have criticised or shown a lack of respect to the religion			1
in 2004 , the @entity116 film - maker @entity115 was shot , stabbed and partially decapitated in broad daylight on a @entity116 street			0
his killer , @entity119 , objected to a film @entity115 had made which criticised some of the @entity124 ’s teachings about women			0
it breeds self - censorship			0
in 2005 the @entity130 newspaper @entity129 discovered that no illustrator in @entity130 would depict @entity37 ’s founder for a series of children ’s books on world religions			1
the paper commissioned a dozen cartoonists to break this apparent taboo and published the results			0
the subsequent furore saw burnings and lootings of @entity130 embassies across the @entity145 and threats against @entity130 worldwide			0
confronted : film - maker @entity115 was shot , stabbed and partially decapitated in daylight on a street over a film he had made that critisised some of the @entity124 ’s teachings about women having investigated and written about the growth of @entity37 fundamentalism and its effects on our society for some 15 years , i came to know some of those involved in that @entity130 newspaper , as well as those at @entity165 , the @entity155 magazine attacked yesterday			1
i began to realise how they had to endure constant threats to their safety , yet they continued to publish because they believed supremely in the right to freedom of expression , the right to make jokes about anyone and any subject , however powerful or revered they may be			1
@entity165 is a satirical , secular , punchy magazine which has picked up themes most people wanted to ignore			0
in the wake of the 2005 @entity130 cartoons furore , it was about the only magazine that , sticking to its principles , chose to print any depiction of @entity37 ’s founding prophet			1
the magazine , which laughs at all religions , politics and beliefs , argued that if you are to be free you can not allow any ideology to hold such a privileged position as to be above criticism			2
and so they lampooned @entity119 , and @entity197 – as well as other targets like critics of @entity37 and the @entity201 politician @entity200			1
after an issue that played on the magazine ’s name and sharia law with the title ‘ @entity208 ’ , and mercilessly mocked @entity37 fundamentalists , a firebomb was thrown into its offices			1
its editor – who died yesterday , along with his police protection officer – received constant death threats			2
but @entity165 magazine was not alone in being targeted for daring to poke fun			0
in 2010 one of the @entity130 cartoonists was confronted in his home by an axe - wielding @entity220 trained by the @entity222 terrorist group @entity221			0
a different cartoonist from @entity224 , @entity225 , was targeted for death in a separate attack			1
across @entity13 i have encountered countless people – muslim , ex-muslim and @entity233 – who have faced death threats			2
two years ago a 70 - year - old friend of mine in @entity130 – the historian and journalist @entity237 , who founded a @entity238 in the wake of the cartoons affair – woke to a ring from the postman			0
daring : @entity165 lampooned @entity119 , and @entity197 – as well as other targets like critics of @entity37 and the @entity201 politician @entity200			1
above , the paper 's editor and cartoonist , @entity249 but the man at the door was not the postman			0
he was a young man with a gun who fired at @entity225 ’s head at almost point - blank range			0
as @entity225 struggled with his would - be assassin on his own doorstep , the man fired again			0
the gun jammed and the culprit ran off			0
if you have seen and studied these cases of assassination and attempted assassination as many times as i have you notice certain patterns emerging			0
one of the most common is for @entity270 apologists for these terrorists to suggest that the victims have provoked the rage of fundamentalists – and they have therefore brought it upon themselves			0
nothing could have been further from the truth			0
the only people responsible for the carnage in this insidious and evil campaign to stamp out our freedoms are the thugs and murderers who carry it out			2
in galleries , newspapers and magazines every day and week of the year there are works of art and articles that offend mainstream @entity291			0
cartoons abound at @entity293 depicting the @entity294 or the @entity295 with a humorous twist ; there are revolting and puerile cards whose @entity293 messages contain foul language			0
imagine that a @entity291 – any @entity291 – were to have responded to those cartoons or images by decapitating or gunning down the editor or staff of the magazine , newspaper or art gallery in question			0
would we blame his victims , saying they had provoked the outrage ? i think it highly unlikely			0
politicians in @entity155 have in the past dismissed @entity165 as @entity318 and ‘ provocateurs ’ – although one would hope yesterday ’s events will shock them out of complacency			0
the fact is this challenge to our freedoms from radical @entity37 is real and happening now			1
if mainstream politicians ignore or shy away from it , tragedy beckons for all of us .			0

@entity1 attack is latest in long campaign to shut down criticism of @entity37
aim is to place religion above all others and make it immune from criticism
campaign started in @entity55 with fatwa calling for death of @entity58
