by @entity0 only ghostly reminders now remain where once there would have been rows upon rows of sick patients			2
new photographs have emerged of the long - abandoned @entity8 in @entity9 which for decades treated thousands of children struck down with potentially deadly @entity11			1
the site was closed in 1988 and has remained an eerie time warp to a period when the lethal bacterial infection that was spread by coughs and sneezes was endemic in @entity19			1
bloodstained syringes , old bathtubs , discarded photographs and keepsakes from former patients now gather dust			2
a catholic priest helped establish what eventually became @entity8 at the beginning of the 19th century to treat local orphans and destitute children			1
the facility soon became one of the centres treating @entity11 - playing a part in helping to cut the number of cases from 50,000 a year in @entity19 in the 1950s , to 5,000 in the 1980s			1
abandoned : an old wheelchair , left , and a bath tub , right , gather dust in the once bustling @entity8 in @entity24 which once used to treat the local children and disadvantaged people for a host of ailments including the bacteria infection tb which was endemic in @entity19 for much of the previous century frozen in time : syringes and an old photograph lie discarded on one of the old hospital beds left inside the abandoned @entity23 in @entity24 treatment : a patient 's x-ray left inside the abandoned hospital hints at a past when this facility would have been a hive of activity caring for hundreds of patients @entity11 used to be known as consumption because the bacterium ate holes in the lungs			1
from 50,000 cases a year in @entity19 in the 1950s , the rate fell to 5,000 in the 1980s			1
it is a bacterial infection which is spread by inhaling drops of saliva when an infected person coughs , speaks or sneezes			0
the disease mainly affects the lungs , but can travel to other parts of the body including the brain , kidneys , bones and joints			0
the disease is curable with a six - month course of antibiotics , but a drug - resistant form can develop if the course is not completed			0
left untreated it can prove fatal			0
symptoms include a persistent cough that lasts for more than three weeks that gets progressively worse , unexplained weight loss , fever , night sweats , chest pain , fatigue and loss of appetite			0
however , many people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the bacteria remain in the body , they are not infectious			0
during the 1940s , when tuberculosis was widespread it was common to see ' @entity117 ' signs on the buses			0
by 1990 the by - law was phased out , but a new sure in cases of @entity11 has prompted some local authorities to again prohibit spitting in public places			1
these eerie photographs were captured by an urban explorer known as @entity125 , who took up photography after becoming intrigued by the abandoned contents of the derelict houses close to his childhood home			0
' these photographs show the hospital as it was when it was abandoned back in 1988 , ' says @entity134			1
' medicine bottles , syringes , wheelchairs and hospital beds have all been left behind - all that 's missing are the patients			2
' you always see old mental asylums pop up in the media , but nobody really pays much attention to these small old hospitals that treated life threatening illnesses			0
' it was a place that i could n't resist visiting			0
' the most interesting thing i saw inside was the old fashioned wheelchair , as it 's not something you see every day			0
' hospital beds are pretty much the same , but you could tell straight away that the wheelchairs dated back a fair few years			2
' st. @entity159 's @entity158 was built during the 1900s , and was used for the treatment of tuberculosis and more specifically for practice in the field of orthopedics			0
the building still features its original barn like doors , which could be fully opened to allow air into the building or even wheel the hospital beds out into the open			2
' with locations like this , most people are shocked to see hospital equipment dating back to the 1900s just left behind rotting away			2
' there were loads of hospital beds , drawings by previous patients and a few post cards			2
' there were also old x-ray images , cameras and even medicine bottles , just left behind for the foreseeable future			0
' @entity188 â€™s @entity158 was part of father @entity190 which was set up to offer services for orphaned children and pupils at local boys ' school in the early to mid 1900 's			1
father @entity196 was the @entity197 for the protection of homeless and friendless catholic children first secretary and administrator			1
under his stewardship the organisation set out to build hospitals and care facilities for children from all catholic homes in the diocese and the catholic children from the workhouse hospitals			1
hopes that the disease could be completely eliminated were dashed in the 1980s with the rise of drug - resistant strains			0
tuberculosis cases in @entity19 , numbering around 117,000 in 1913 , had fallen to around 5,000 in 1987 , but cases rose again , reaching 6,300 in 2000 and 7,600 cases in 2005			1
past : what appears to be a blood - stained syringe list left discarded next to a photograph of an injury on a hospital bed inside the abandoned @entity8 in @entity24 @entity223 : outside the @entity225 building was part of father @entity190 buildings across the @entity19 which provided services for locals and the neighbouring boys school , along with care for orphaned children of early to mid 1900 's memories : old photographs from a foreign holiday , left , and callipers and walking aids are left on a camping - style bed , right , in the abandoned @entity8			1
