there are fears that e-cigarettes still carry the risks of passive smoking , a new report warns electronic cigarettes should be banned from indoors and face a raft of new curbs over safety fears , the @entity6 insisted yesterday			1
it claims they pose a risk to bystanders of ‘ toxicant ’ emissions and warns there is limited evidence they help smokers quit			1
a report by the organisation , which is the public health arm of the @entity25 , says legal steps need to be taken to end the use of e-cigarettes in public indoor spaces and workplaces – and to ban sales to children			1
it recommends stopping manufacturers advertising the devices as ‘ smoking cessation aids ’ until they provide scientific evidence , and calls for rules against fruit , sweet or alcoholic - drink style flavours which may encourage younger smokers			1
vending machines offering the products should be removed ‘ in almost all locations ’ , the report says			1
it warns that e-cigarette vapour could raise background air levels of toxicants and nicotine which may not be acceptable to ‘ involuntarily exposed bystanders ’			1
who adds that few studies have examined whether the devices , invented in @entity55 in 2003 , are effective in helping tobacco smokers to quit , though one trial found they work as well as nicotine patches			1
around 2.1million @entity59 use battery - powered e-cigarettes , which allow users to inhale nicotine but avoid the harm caused by tobacco smoke			2
the @entity59 ’s @entity65 decided they must be regulated as medicines to make them ‘ safer and more effective ’ , but this is not due until 2016			1
some experts have expressed concerns about chemicals in the liquid			0
the new report also recommends preventing manufacturers from marketing e-cigarettes as ' smoking cessation aids ' until they provide scientific evidence to back the claim electronic cigarettes may be more tempting to non-smoking youths than conventional cigarettes , @entity79 researchers warned yesterday			1
and once young people have tried e-cigarettes they are more inclined to give regular cigarettes a try			0
the report , released by the @entity88 , backs up the argument that electronic cigarettes encourage youth smoking			1
the study , based on youth surveys , found that more than a quarter of a million youngsters who had never smoked used an electronic cigarette in 2013			2
this was a threefold increase from 2011			0
those who had tried e-cigarettes were nearly twice as likely to say they would try a conventional cigarette in the next year compared with those who had never tried an e-cigarette , according to the study in the journal @entity107 and @entity108			0
but a major scientific review last month , which looked at 81 studies of e-cigarettes , found they caused less harm than smoking			0
who appears to have ignored appeals from experts to ‘ resist the urge to control and suppress e-cigarettes ’			0
in an open letter in may , 53 researchers and public health specialists warned against over-regulation , saying the devices could be a ‘ significant health innovation ’ and that classifying them as tobacco ‘ will do more harm than good ’			1
professor @entity127 , of @entity128 and public health campaign group @entity129 , accused @entity6 of ‘ cherry - picking ’ the science			2
he said it was ‘ exaggerating the risks of e-cigarettes , while downplaying the huge potential of these non-combustible low - risk nicotine products to end the epidemic of tobacco - related disease ’			2
‘ who claims e-cigarettes are a threat to public health , but this statement has no evidence to support it , and ignores the large number of people who are using them to cut down or quit smoking completely , ’ he added			2
@entity147 said it could not back any plans to add e-cigarettes to smoke - free laws			0
the charity ’s @entity150 said there was ‘ no evidence of any harm to bystanders ’ , adding : ‘ smokers who switch to using e-cigarettes … are likely to substantially reduce their health risks … and research suggests that they are already helping smokers to quit			1
’ a @entity161 spokesman said : ‘ we have already set out our intention to change the law to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children under 18			0
’ professor @entity167 , professor of @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity171 ’s @entity170 , said : e-cigarette use results in much lower exposure to toxins for users than regular cigarettes , says professor @entity167 ( file picture ) ' the e-cigarette market is rapidly evolving and research on the huge variety of products on the market , what they emit and what their health impacts are , lags behind			1
' what we do know is that e-cigarettes do not emit the thousands of constituents delivered in tobacco smoke , 70 of which are known carcinogens			0
instead e-cigarettes emit a vapourised solution principally of propylene glycol or glycerine , water and flavours , usually with nicotine			0
' while the @entity6 report concludes that e-cigarettes use ’ produces lower exposures to toxicants than combustible products ’ i believe that this is an understatement			2
we can be confident that e-cigarette use results in much lower exposure to toxins for users			0
' although e-cigarette vapour may be an irritant to people in close proximity to the e-cigarette user , there is no evidence of harm from other people inhaling e-cigarette vapour unlike the known risks of second hand cigarette smoke			2
there is also as yet no evidence that e-cigarettes are renormalisng smoking			0
based on their analysis , the @entity6 proposes a range of regulations for e-cigarettes and my concern is that these will deter smokers from trying to use them			0
cigarette smoking is so uniquely dangerous that anything we can do to encourage smokers to stop should be welcomed			0

new report by @entity25 agency raises fears over safety of electronic devices
says their use should be regulated and sales to minors banned
still *unclear* whether *exhaled* vapour poses health risk to bystanders
who fears *competition* for market share may be *compromising* safety
