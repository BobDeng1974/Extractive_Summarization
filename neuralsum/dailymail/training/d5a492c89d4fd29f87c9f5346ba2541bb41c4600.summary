by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 30 june 2013 updated : 02:20 est , 1 july 2013 leading companies have been summoned for talks in @entity3 with consumer affairs minister @entity4 today controversial payday loan firms will not be banned from charging sky - high interest rates , despite a promised government crackdown today on sharp practices in the industry			1
leading companies have been summoned for talks in @entity3 with consumer affairs minister @entity4 today amid mounting concern that they are driving desperate families to financial ruin			1
in a toughly - worded intervention yesterday , miss @entity4 said she was determined to curb ‘ irresponsible behaviour which exploits vulnerable consumers in financial strife ’			1
but , to the dismay of campaigners , miss @entity4 confirmed payday loan firms such as @entity23 will not be ordered to cut their interest rates			1
she cited concerns that people could be forced into borrowing from even shadier loan @entity10 ’s many critics insist that the exorbitant interest rates , which can top 5,000 per cent a year , are the root cause of the misery suffered by hundreds of thousands of people taking out payday loans			1
last month the archbishop of @entity36 , @entity35 , called for a legal cap on payday lenders and the level of interest they are allowed to charge			2
and the consumer organisation which ? published a study showing that 1million families a month are forced to take out payday loans in order to get by			2
it found that almost 400,000 people take out the high interest loans to pay for essentials such as food and fuel			0
a further 240,000 need the cash to pay existing loans			0
almost half said they could not cover their repayments , forcing them deeper into debt as their ‘ short - term ’ loans are ‘ rolled over ’ , with fresh interest attached			2
today ’s summit comes just days after the £ 2billion industry was referred by the @entity64 to the @entity65			0
it will have the power to ban or limit products			0
but it will take up to 18 months to report			0
archbishop of @entity36 , @entity35 , called for a legal cap on payday lenders and the level of interest they are allowed to charge			2
the summit will be updated by the @entity64 , which said some firms ’ business models appeared to be based around customers taking out loans which they are forced to roll over because they can not meet the repayments			0
this then leaves the customer trapped with that firm because they would struggle to switch to anyone else			0
up to half of lenders ’ revenues were found by the @entity64 to come from the extra charges and interest coming from loans being rolled over			0
the @entity64 has given the 50 lenders until the end of july to respond to calls for them to clean up their act or face closure			0
five have since surrendered their licence , but only 20 have responded to date			0
@entity99 mp @entity98 said that it is essential to discuss capping interest rates last night @entity99 mp @entity98 accused ministers of being too cosy with the industry , and warned it was futile to try and tackle the problem without addressing interest rates			1
she said : ‘ having a summit about payday lending without talking about capping interest rates is like discussing arson without mentioning matches			1
’ mr @entity35 warned last month : ‘ once you have taken out the loan it is difficult to get out of the cycle			2
with the rates offered , simply paying off the interest becomes a struggle			2
’ miss @entity4 said the firms would be challenged today over why they had failed to clean up their act and how they planned to put it @entity123 minister claimed that capping the crippling interest rates charged by payday lenders might limit the market and drive people to seek even more desperate solutions to their financial problems			1
she said : ‘ some people say we should just cap the interest @entity132 that could shut down short - term loans and force people towards illegal loan sharks or other extreme measures			1
’ miss @entity4 suggested she would focus on limiting the ease with which loans are ‘ rolled over ’ – a practice widely blamed for driving people deeper into debt			1
and she raised concerns about automatic payment systems that allow lenders to raid the bank accounts of clients in order to claw back money they are owed .			0
