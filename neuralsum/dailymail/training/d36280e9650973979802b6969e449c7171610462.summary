not all diamonds last forever and some can fade away in just a few seconds , according to new research			1
the finding contradicts @entity5 ’s 1971 @entity4 theme song and the popular belief that diamonds last forever - the word ‘ diamond ’ even means ' unbreakable ' in ancient @entity10			2
scientists used an electron beam to prove that microscopic diamonds in treated coal only survive for seconds before they revert to a form of less exciting carbon			1
diamond in the rough : the creation of nanodiamonds in treated coal show that some microscopic diamonds only last seconds before fading back into less - structured forms of carbon under the impact of an electron beam			1
the dark spots in these images taken using an electron microscope , are nanodiamonds among coal researchers at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , discovered the effect of the nanodiamonds while they were working on ways to chemically reduce carbon from coal and make it soluble			1
nanodiamonds are used in a variety of industrial processes and are increasingly being used in medical research to deliver chemotherapy and improve bone growth , for example			0
chemists @entity44 and @entity46 first noticed nanodiamonds forming among the shapeless , hydrogen - infused layers of graphite			2
they took close - up images of the coal with an electron microscope - which fires an electron beam at the point of interest - and found that the energy from the beam congealed clusters of hydrogenated carbon atoms , some of which took on the lattice - like structure of nanodiamonds			1
energy from the electron beam congealed clusters of hydrogenated carbon atoms , turning them temporarily to nanodiamonds			1
this image shows a nanodiamond ( the dark spot ) reverting to coal dr @entity44 said : ‘ the beam is very powerful			1
to knock hydrogen atoms off of something takes a tremendous amount of energy			0
’ even without the kind of pressure needed to make diamonds that can be seen with the naked eye , the energy knocked loose hydrogen atoms to prompt a chain reaction between layers of graphite in the coal			2
this resulted in diamonds between two and 10 nanometers wide ( up to 0.00001mm ) , according to the study published in the @entity90 ’s @entity89			1
the duo discovered that most of the diamonds faded away under the power of the electron beam and documented the changes in photos taken over 30 seconds			1
‘ the small diamonds are not stable and they revert to the starting material - the anthracite [ coal ] , ’ dr @entity44 said			1
scientists have previously discovered that nanodiamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants			0
the miniscule gems , which are invisible to the human eye , could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis in the future humans could have diamond - encrusted teeth to improve oral health and fight disease			2
scientists discovered in september 2013 that nanodiamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants			0
the miniscule gems , which are invisible to the human eye , could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis , which is a potentially debilitating disease in which bones break down due to reduced blood flow			0
scientists from the @entity126 and the @entity127 in @entity128 discovered that nanodiamonds - by - products of conventional mining that are four to five nanometers in diameter - could be used as a delivery system for proteins in the mouth as an improved treatment for osteonecrosis			2
the disease affects the jaw and can prevent people from eating and speaking			0
@entity140 , professor of oral biology and medicine at the @entity143 explained that doctors performing bone repair operations , which are typically costly and time consuming , surgically inset a sponge to administer proteins that promote bone growth such as bone morphogenic protein			0
his team discovered that using nanodiamonds to deliver these proteins could be more effective in administering the proteins as they quickly bind to the bone			0
the unique surface of the diamonds allows the proteins to be delivered more slowly , which may allow the affected area to be treated for a longer period of time			0
furthermore , the nanodiamonds can be administered non-invasively , such as by an injection or even an oral rinse .			0

researchers at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , created the nanodiamonds in treated coal using a powerful electron beam
the diamonds *measured* between two and 10 nanometers wide
some of the microscopic diamonds lasted seconds before returning to less - structured forms of carbon
