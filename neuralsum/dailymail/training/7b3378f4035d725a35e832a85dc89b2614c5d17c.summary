it was business as usual for @entity2 as he scored a double on the first day of the season for the fourth consecutive campaign			0
@entity6 won their first game 3 - 0 against @entity8 despite @entity10 ’s red card just before the break			1
@entity2 ’s characteristic brace was achieved without the suspended @entity13 and the injured @entity14 but he had more than enough help from @entity17 born youngster @entity16			2
the young striker will not be 19 until september 1 but already has @entity6 fans predicting a big future – if he can stay in the side when @entity14 and @entity13 return			0
@entity6 have now scored 26 goals in their last six opening matches and not since 2008 have they been beaten on the opening day			0
that front three of @entity16 , @entity27 and @entity2 was a clean sweep for the club ’s @entity30 youth academy as @entity6 kicked - off the season with the entire bench and six of the starters products of its youth system			1
@entity16 hit the post on 22 minutes as @entity8 began to creak at the back with @entity2 carrying on from his @entity73 trophy performance against @entity75 side @entity74 in @entity6 ’s last pre-season friendly			1
@entity77 crashed a shot on to the crossbar on the half hour and @entity2 was then put through by @entity80 and lobbed @entity81 but the flag had been raised			0
@entity16 ’s decision making is what makes him stand out but on 40 minutes he made the wrong choice when put through by @entity2			2
he should have shot but tried to find @entity27 and gave the ball away			0
lucky for some ? a lost looking black cat delayed play at the start of the game after running on to the pitch feline frenzy : the black cat was eventually removed from the @entity42 pitch after being chased down by stewards taking the puss ! @entity6 superstar @entity2 ( @entity96 ) watches on as the errant cat is chased around the pitch minutes after the first whistle early shower : @entity101 is sent off within minutes of @entity6 taking the lead in the first - half teenage kicks : 18 - year - old @entity16 celebrates after scoring @entity6 's second goal with a delightful flick remember the name ! youngster @entity16 was given a standing ovation after being substituted in the second - half @entity6 finally got themselves in front four minutes before the break when @entity112 ’s poor clearance went straight to @entity113 and his excellent first time pass to the edge of the area played in @entity2 who spun and drilled his shot past @entity81 for his first goal of the new season			1
he also scored the first goal of the campaign in 2008 and 2010 and @entity6 won the @entity122 in both seasons			0
@entity8 were given some hope just before half time when @entity126 broke away for the visitors and cut across @entity10 who was scampering back to clear the danger			1
@entity126 tumbled as the @entity57 clipped him and referee @entity129 pulled out the red card			0
@entity6 brought central defender @entity131 on at the start of the second half for @entity27 switching to a 4 - 3 - 2 formation but any sense that @entity8 would come back into the game evaporated when with his first shot on target in the second half @entity16 found the back of the net			1
@entity142 midfielder @entity80 who must fill @entity144 ’s boots this season in midfield for @entity6 played a pass that the former @entity149 captain would have been proud of and with the outside of his left boot @entity16 made it 2 - 0			1
@entity2 made it three on 63 minutes when @entity154 rolled the ball across the line of the penalty area and he jigged around three white - shirted @entity8 defenders to make enough space for himself to shoot into the far corner			1
take a bow : @entity162 was taking charge of a competitive game for the first time as @entity6 manager catch me if you can : @entity2 look refreshed after being given an extended break following his @entity171 exertions next generation : @entity162 chose to start with youngster @entity173 ( r ) as part of @entity6 's attacking threesome is it a bird , is it a plane ? @entity6 defender @entity179 leaps over @entity8 goalkeeper @entity81 ( r ) @entity180 replaced @entity16 on 66 minutes as @entity8 failed to test @entity6 ’s @entity181 on his home debut			1
rodrgiuez wayward cross shot was typical of the visitors no - show in attack			0
at the other @entity180 broke away and when fed by @entity2 drew a save from @entity81 but @entity6 could not add to their lead			2
it was a more than satisfactory start for @entity162			0
debutants @entity16 and @entity80 had both impressed and @entity2 had shown that with the weight of @entity171 expectation lifted from his shoulders this season he seems well on the way to getting back to his very best			2
