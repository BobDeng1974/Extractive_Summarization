it is a powerful connection between two mothers , captured on camera			0
@entity5 , travelling in @entity3 with @entity4 , breaks down after a young @entity3 mum , @entity6 , recounts the story of the tragic death of her baby son @entity9			1
the emotionally - charged moment comes when the television presenter learns that @entity9 could n't be saved because the cost of hospital care for the seriously ill infant was too expensive			2
after his death , her father burned his body in the mountains when @entity6 , 20 , asks @entity5 if she has a family of her own , her thoughts clearly turn to daughters @entity32 , seven , and @entity34 , three and the star begins to weep			1
many mothers in the country are forced to take expensive loans out to pay for hospital care , or like @entity6 , face trying to care for desperately ill infants alone , often with tragic consequences			2
@entity5 explains : ' @entity6 gave birth at home but realised @entity44 was very unwell so she walked for hours to reach the nearest hospital			1
' he had pneumonia , but in @entity3 a day in hospital costs a month ’s salary so after eight days @entity6 had no choice but to take @entity44 home			1
' a few days later , as she was breastfeeding , she looked down and realised he had gone			0
' @entity6 's father then burned the body of the young baby in the hills , leaving @entity6 to grieve			1
@entity5 continues : ' @entity6 was clearly still in shock and said this was the first time she ’d really talked about it			1
television star @entity5 , an ambassador for @entity4 , travelled to maternity units in @entity3 to raise awareness of the country 's ongoing healthcare crisis @entity5 met health workers in the mountainous country ; save the children say there is currently only one health professional to every 1,493 people in @entity3 ' her friends and family told her to delete her photos of the baby or she would n’t be able to move on			1
but she had one tiny photo saved as the contact image next to her mum ’s number			2
so now , every time her mum rings , rhythm ’s picture flashes up			0
' as a mum myself that just broke my heart			1
i have so many pictures of my girls on my phone but i could n’t bring them out and show her			0
i could n’t do it			0
” the ambassador for the charity said of her experience travelling to the mountainous country , where there is only one health worker to every 1,493 people : ' as a mum , i know how terrifying it is to give birth , even with a trained midwife available to help			0
but in @entity3 i heard some harrowing stories			2
' @entity5 shot a video diary of her time at @entity100 in @entity3 and is clearly shocked by the conditions that await pregnant women in the maternity ward			1
she describes ' blood on the floor and blood on the walls ' inside the labour rooms and compares it to her own experience of giving birth in @entity111 : ' when i think of where i gave birth , in a sterile hospital			0
sometimes you can have a water birth , you can have your baby at home ... we have all of these options			0
' she adds : ' i met mums who had to walk on foot or were carried for up to seven hours in a wicker basket to get to a clinic because there are n't any ambulances ; women who had to give birth by the side of the road without a health worker present ; mothers who could n't afford basic medical care for their children – the result was horrifying , and always the same : children dying needlessly			0
' @entity5 is pictured with @entity136 , 23 , ( left ) who has taken out loans to pay for hospital care for her sick son @entity140 , aged 6 months			1
@entity5 ( right ) cradles a baby as she meets mothers in the maternity ward in the @entity100 in @entity3 @entity5 with six - month - old baby @entity144 at the infant 's home in @entity3 's @entity100 district			1
@entity144 's mother had lost her first two babies to childbirth complications ' as a mum , i know how terrifying it is to give birth , even with a trained midwife available to help			2
but in @entity3 i heard some harrowing stories			2
' @entity5 visits a delivery room in a hospital in @entity159 district looking at the facilities on the maternity ward ... pregnant women can travel for up to a day to reach their nearest hospital with its ' no child born to @entity167 ' campaign , @entity4 are highlighting the plight of children dying from preventable causes and asking for the same awareness that eventually halted the spread of the ebola virus to be applied to @entity3 's healthcare tragedy			1
it is urging the government , via a petition , to ' lead the world towards the goal of ending preventable child deaths by 2030 '			0
the charity is working to provide vital equipment to health centres across the country as well as equipping health visitors with training and offering life - saving advice to new mothers			0
