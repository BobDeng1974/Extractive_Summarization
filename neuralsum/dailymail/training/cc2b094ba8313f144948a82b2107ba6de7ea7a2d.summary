by @entity1 reporter published : 14:17 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 15:15 est , 13 august 2012 a bankrupt @entity4 man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £ 50,000 despite being in the @entity8 illegally , a court heard			2
@entity9 , 58 , and his son @entity10 , 25 , ran a corner shop and operated a @entity13 money transfer service offering ‘ excellent rates ’ on transactions			1
but more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity4 , were left thousands of pounds out of pocket			1
father and son partnership : bankrupt @entity25 , left , and his son @entity10 , right , together stole nearly £ 50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to @entity19 jailing father and son for two years each , judge @entity29 described their offences against their own @entity35 community in @entity38 ’s @entity37 area as ‘ despicable			1
’ judge @entity39 said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ that the men had been able to run a shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal overstayers and @entity25 was bankrupt			1
@entity25 came to the @entity8 on a visitor ’s permit eight years ago and never left			2
his son was in the @entity8 on a student permit which would not allow him to work or run a business			2
@entity38 crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £ 48,206			1
one of their customers , retired @entity55 , lost £ 1,000 he requested to be transferred to @entity19 to pay for his operation there			2
prosecutor @entity57 said : ' he was told it would take 8 weeks , which would take him close to the date of his operation			0
' when he got to @entity19 he still had not received the promised pin number to access his money			2
' he contacted a friend in @entity38 to ask him to complain and the message he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back			0
jailed : @entity9 and @entity10 were sentenced to two years in prison at @entity68 ' he has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays			1
' mrs @entity57 said another victim of the con , @entity73 , paid the men £ 1,500 to be transferred to @entity19 to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father ’s memory			0
mrs @entity57 continued : ' the money never arrived			2
' she detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - @entity85 and her husband lost almost £ 5,500 which was supposed to be going to @entity20 ; @entity88 lost £ 1,000 destined for @entity19 ; @entity89 transferred £ 7,000 to @entity19 in two transactions but it never arrived			1
there were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds , she added			2
mrs @entity57 said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after @entity10 applied in october 2010 to become an agent for @entity8 , a @entity13 money transfer company			1
the application was granted and he was approved after ‘ various checks had been carried out ’			0
mrs @entity57 told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants did n't appear to ' have come up on the checks '			0
she added that they also failed to notice that @entity25 had been made bankrupt in 2008			0
fraud : the pair set up a @entity13 money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to @entity19 @entity10 admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between january and march 2011			1
@entity9 admitted 12 similar charges			0
mrs @entity57 said @entity10 was responsible for £ 33,688 of the total fraud and @entity25 £ 14,518			1
@entity121 , defending , said @entity10 had come to @entity122 legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at @entity124 to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father			1
@entity9 had trusted his son ’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit , she said			1
ms @entity121 said that @entity13 had checked only @entity10 ’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service			1
she added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and @entity25 was fearful of going back to @entity4 because he has health problems which are better treated here			0
despite his status he has been getting free medication , she said			0
jailing the men , judge @entity39 said : ' over a period of three months you stole just under £ 50,000 from many members of your local community			2
' that money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks			1
' people trusted you , especially you , father , because of the seniority that you held			0
i accept that when you started this business in november you ran it legitimately for a short period of time			0
' but by the middle of january you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters			0
you have done considerable damage to your community and you know it			0
' these were despicable offences			0
' he told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the @entity178 .			0

@entity181 , 58 , and his son @entity10 , 25 , both stole money from customers using their @entity13 money transfer service
both were jailed for two years each at @entity68
