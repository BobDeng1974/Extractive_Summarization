the going got so tough for @entity3 ’ rugby sevens side yesterday that they were prompted to call on the son of soul star @entity6			1
but when @entity9 ran on to the field as a second - half substitute , the tannoy announcer at @entity8 was not quick enough to put together a melody of @entity6 ’s greatest hits , which included , ‘ when the going gets tough , the tough get going ’ in 1990 and ‘ @entity16 ’ in 1977			1
despite the defeats , he still enjoyed the experience of playing in front of the biggest crowd of his rugby career			0
‘ my dad is on tour at the moment so he could n’t come to @entity8 but it was great for me to run out in front of more than 40,000 rugby fans at the @entity20 , ’ said @entity9 , who is eligible to play for @entity3 because his mother , @entity41 , was born there			2
‘ at times like this you have to just take your chance and do your best			0
‘ i am musical and studied music at university but rugby is my passion ; i have been playing since i was seven			0
thumbs up : soul singer @entity6 will not be pleased when he sees @entity3 ' scoreline performer : @entity6 , pictured performing at @entity59 , has a large fanbase ‘ i am musical like my dad and when i retire i might do more of it but i am playing rugby at the moment and loving it			2
’ @entity64 beat @entity65 40 - 0 to register a second victory without conceding a point following their 57 - 0 thrashing of @entity70			0
@entity71 thumped @entity72 52 - 0 , while @entity33 , after losing 17 - 14 to @entity73 , hit back by thrashing @entity3 and @entity74 said : ‘ we ’re playing well and if we keep doing what we ’re doing then we can be confident of coming through			1
