nobody was more relieved than @entity1 as @entity2 staged a remarkable second - half comeback to keep alive their hopes of an @entity6 fourth round meeting with @entity7			1
the @entity2 midfielder presented @entity9 with a goal in the 44th minute - and looked to have sent @entity11 towards the next round			1
@entity9 latched on to a weak header by @entity1 to advance and drill the ball past goalkeeper @entity15			2
@entity11 players look on with dejection after @entity19 late equaliser earned @entity2 a replay @entity21 fires the ball home from close range to give @entity11 a 2 - 0 lead against @entity2 it was a key moment in the tie because @entity2 were threatening to hit back after going behind to a 19th minute strike from @entity29			1
@entity29 , whose loan from @entity31 has been extended until the end of the season , finished in style when he collected a clearance just outside the area			2
it was a massive setback for @entity2 , who won their third round tie against @entity40 only four days earlier after being ordered to replay it because they used an ineligible player in the first meeting			1
they responded to @entity29 's goal by creating a string of chances for @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , but failed to take any of them			1

and @entity2 got their deserved equaliser when @entity63 pulled the ball back and @entity19 drilled the ball beyond @entity15 in the 85th minute			1
@entity11 also went close to a stoppage time goal when @entity70 's shot was well saved by @entity15			0
@entity29 looks to get hold of the ball ahead of @entity63 as @entity11 searched for another goal @entity2 manager @entity74 said : ' it was a fantastic comeback , but it was the least we deserved			1
' we conceded goals against the run of play in the first - half and it is always hard to come back from 2 - 0			1
we were very disappointed with their second goal because that is always important in any games			0
' but we know our lads are fit and it 's a credit to everyone at the club that we came back so well			0
' @entity11 are a very good side and we showed how both of us want to play @entity7			2
now whoever goes through will deserve to go through			0
' @entity93 is tacked by @entity59 during the first half of the cup encounter @entity2 boss @entity96 said : ' it was certainly an entertaining tie			2
@entity2 are a good sde with a depth of squad that is better than ours			0
we have to put some square pegs in round holes and it makes a difference			0
' the second goal gave us a good cushion , but we knew they would put us under pressure			0
we knew it was coming and we talked about it and tried to organise			0
' it 's up to the players to cut out the danger and we did it until later in the game when we looked a little bit tired and they made changes that made a difference			0

@entity11 and @entity2 face a replay after 2 - 2 draw at @entity123
first - half goals from @entity29 and @entity9 gave hosts the lead
*visitors* hit back in second half through @entity50 and @entity19
