we 've all been tightening our belts for a few years and judging by the chancellor ’s trousers , so has he			1
but now things are looking up , perhaps mr @entity5 could afford to pop out and buy a pair of suit trousers that actually reach his shoes			2
while he undoubtedly hoped the country would be listening to what he had to say , many seemed more interested in what he was wearing			0
we 've all been tightening our belts for a few years and judging by the chancellor ’s trousers , so has he in fact , his half - mast turn - ups attracted almost as many comments among @entity18 users as some of his @entity21 measures			1
some accused him of looking like a schoolboy while others pointed to the fact that his navy blue suit , unusually , had three buttons rather than the standard two and curiously high lapels			1
the budget suit – accessorised with a sombre , pale grey tie - provoked the strongest reaction on @entity18 yesterday			1
while some users complimented him on the cut , many more questioned his ‘ strange ’ choice			2
it is not known from where mr @entity5 bought his unorthodox suit			2
his father , sir @entity5 , is said to favour @entity40 tailors @entity41 where a navy ‘ 160s ’ suit costs £ 1,150 and @entity45 and @entity46 shirts £ 145			0
@entity48 's half - mast turn - ups attracted almost as many comments on @entity18 as his @entity21 measures some even accused mr @entity5 , 43 , of wearing make - up , pointing to what appeared to be a tell - tale foundation line along his jaw , while his hair was compared to that of @entity57 star @entity56			1
it is not the first time his appearance has attracted comments			1
by 2014 his rather full figure of the year before had been replaced by his current slim look thanks to him adopting the fashionable 5:2 diet			0
in an interview last year , he said he had lost two stone on the diet , popular with celebrities , after seeking advice from his doctor			0
it involved him limiting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week but eating normally on the other five			0
he was also seen jogging around @entity72 , across the road from the @entity74 and changed his haircut , favouring a shorter crop , part of an apparent bid to appear more youthful			0
his new look is said to be down to one of his senior government aides , @entity80			0
she used to work as a producer for @entity85 political editor @entity84 before mr @entity5 hired her to overhaul his image			0
his look yesterday was a far cry from his appearance back in 2010 , when he first took up the government post and favoured a slightly more old fashioned hair - cut and suit .			1
