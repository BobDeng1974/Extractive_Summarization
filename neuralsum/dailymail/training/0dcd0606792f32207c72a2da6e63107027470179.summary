laboratory work may not seem glamorous , but scientists in these isolated hubs have access to some of the most spectacular sights in nature			2
these images , compiled by @entity8 as part of an annual competition , reveal the beautiful views scientists see as they peer into the microscope			1
they highlight intricate patterns in tiny creatures such as mice and fruit fly that are also seen in various parts of the human body			1
@entity19 from @entity20 took first place with this image of @entity24 neuromuscular system in the microscopy category			0
@entity24 is a group of small flies , belonging to the family @entity28 , whose members are often called fruit flies as well as being visually stunning , these images have helped cellular biologists from around the world uncover new treatments for diseases			1
the global imaging company has announced the winners of the competition as @entity19 from @entity20 , @entity39 from @entity40 and @entity41 from @entity42			1
with over 23,000 votes cast by the public , their images will be used to light up @entity46 in @entity47 between 25 - 27 april			1
pictured here are lung cancer cells with the blue stained areas showing @entity51			0
lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer			0
there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages a microscopic close up of fruit fly larvae			2
when fully grown , fruit flies are typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black , with red eyes			1
many species have distinct black patterns on the wings and are about 2 - 4 millimetres long highlights include an image of a ‘ spine ganglion ’			2
this is a nodule on a dorsal root of the spine that contains nerve cells that carry signals from the body 's organs to the brain			2
another image shows a microscopic close up of fruit fly larvae			0
when fully grown , fruit flies are typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black , with red eyes			1
as well as showing the larvae , @entity19 from @entity20 took first place with a stunning image of the neuromuscular system of a fruit fly			0
this year 's competition attracted over 100 entries from scientists who are using either high - content analysis or high - and super resolution microscopy			1
pictured here are human bronchial epithelial cells stained showing dna in blue beautiful yet beastly : @entity99 ( pictured right ) is a species of salivary parasite which causes @entity103 trypanosomiasis , also known as sleeping sickness			0
lung adenocarcinoma ( pictured left ) which is a form of lung cancer pictured here are neurons in the brain of a mouse			0
images such as this could help researchers understand how conditions develop in illnesses such as @entity118 's mouse spermatocyte are pictured here			0
these will give rise to rise to sperm cells			0
this image by @entity41 , @entity124 , was a regional winner in the microscopy category this year ’s competition attracted over 100 entries from scientists who are using either high - content analysis or high - and super resolution microscopy			1
their images investigate at the cellular level a wide variety of diseases such as cancer , muscle disease and the effects of parasitic infections			2
‘ this year ’s three winning images are once again incredibly beautiful and compelling , reminding us of the cellular complexity behind disease and why the study of cells is so important , ’ said @entity140 , general manager of @entity141 and @entity142 , @entity8			1
‘ we were delighted to receive so many outstanding entries to the competition , which highlights how cell imaging is helping scientists explore the universe of the cell and is advancing our understanding of so many life - threatening and life - limiting diseases			1
’ the optic stalk of a fruit fly is seen here			0
the stalk is one of a pair of slender embryonic structures that becomes the optic nerve in the eye pictured is a spine ganglion			0
this is a nodule on a dorsal root of the spine that contains cell bodies of nerve cells ( neurons ) that carry signals from the body 's organs			0

the images taken by lab scientists have helped biologists uncover new treatments for a range of diseases
they reveal complex patterns in creatures such as mice and fruit flies that are also seen in parts off the human body
they were compiled by @entity8 as part of an annual competition and the winners will have their images *showcased* in @entity46 , @entity47 between 25 - 27 april
