@entity0 could prove @entity3 boss @entity2 's surprise choice to succeed @entity4 at outside centre			1
@entity3 's @entity7 coach must quickly solve the conundrum of how best to handle life after record caps - holder @entity4 's summer retirement			1
@entity14 's @entity13 has been widely tipped to fill the void , with @entity4 himself joining that clamour			2
@entity0 ( left ) could replace the retired @entity4 ( right ) as @entity3 's outside centre this season @entity0 is an inside centre by trade and played with @entity4 for years but he could make he switch outside head coach schmidt may well consider sliding @entity4 's long - term centre partner from 12 to 13 however , according to former @entity3 flanker @entity22			1
' it will be interesting to see how that pans out as there are a lot of guys sticking their hands up for the job , ' @entity22 said			2
' there are also serious thoughts of @entity0 moving out there to 13 as well though			2
' you look at him and @entity4 : they are actually very similar players , and @entity0 's probably more suited to outside centre naturally anyway			1
' it 's just that @entity4 's been there so long that no one was going to move him			2
' maybe you could bring a bigger centre in there , and perhaps @entity0 could move across			1
' @entity3 claimed just their second win in @entity44 in 42 years to claim the @entity46 crown in @entity4 's international farewell last term			1
the 35 - year - old 's exit leaves a vast chasm for @entity51 to fill , especially with just 12 fixtures left before @entity53 2015			0
@entity0 has refused to speculate on his own future beyond the end of the current campaign , but the 34 - year - old is expected to plough on to the @entity53 barring injury			0
former @entity3 flanker @entity22 ( pictured ) believes that @entity0 could make the move to outside centre @entity0 ( second left ) and @entity4 ( right ) played together in the centre for both @entity3 and @entity62 former @entity64 , @entity3 and @entity65 flanker @entity22 believes @entity0 could be the man to slot in at 13 , especially to boost the side 's defensive shape			1
' a lot of guys are putting up their hands : there 's @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 up in @entity77 alone , ' said @entity22			0
' then you 've got @entity13 down at @entity14 of course			0
' so it will be interesting to see how it pans out , because there 's a wave of opportunity there			0
' defence is a 15 - man game obviously , but @entity4 was pretty much a coach in defensive regards , he would always keep you honest and keep the line strong			1
' from a defensive position it 's the most difficult on the pitch , where you 're probably most exposed and you 've got a huge number of decisions to make			0
' so it is a difficult position in that respect , but i think @entity0 would certainly be up to the task			0
' the biggest challenge for anyone going in there of course , is taking up that mantle			0
' obviously in attack @entity111 was amazing but not only from game day , seeing his level of precision in training , the demands he made in terms of where he would want you , i learned so much from him			0
' he certainly had it all down to a fine art , so that 's going to be tough for guys to fill into , but @entity2 will certainly take over that area too			0
' @entity3 legend @entity4 retired from rugby at the end of last season following a glittering career			1
