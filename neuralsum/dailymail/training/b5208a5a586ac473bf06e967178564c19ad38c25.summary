by mail online reporter @entity1 has accused one of the world 's leading publishers of taking too big a cut from ebooks at the expense of authors			1
the online bookseller said @entity11 firm @entity10 , which acts for @entity12 and @entity13 , is handing ' too small a portion ' of the revenue to authors			2
it is the latest blow in a long - running war of words between @entity1 and @entity10 , the fourth - biggest publisher in the @entity20 @entity21 author @entity12 ( pictured ) is one of the clients of @entity11 publisher @entity10			1
she currently receives 25 per cent of revenue from ebooks sold on @entity1 online bookseller @entity1 has been involved in a long - running dispute with @entity11 publisher @entity10 @entity1 's comments follow reports that it had been demanding 50 per cent of the ebook price as its cut from any sale as part of a shake - up of its policies			1
but writing on its @entity37 forum website the company said it was happy with its 30 per cent cut but believed @entity10 should take less			1
currently , @entity10 takes 45 per cent			2
that leaves only 25 per cent for the authors			0
under @entity1 's new proposals it will no longer carry the whole cost of discounting allowing the price of ebooks to go down , the company claimed			1
however authors have dismissed @entity1 's claims saying slashing the price of ebooks could devalue their work and accusing the company of ' thuggish behaviour ' , @entity47 reported			1
the dispute has seen @entity1 remove pre-orders and slow deliveries for some of @entity10 's best - selling authors			1
@entity10 's biggest names include @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity12 's crime alter ego @entity61			2
@entity10 's biggest names include crime writer @entity13 ( left ) and bestselling @entity20 novelist @entity59 ( right ) a post signed by the @entity1 books team said : ' ebooks can and should be less expensive			1
keep in mind that books do n't just compete against books			0
' books compete against mobile games , television , movies , @entity73 , blogs , free news sites and more			0
if we want a healthy reading culture , we have to work hard to be sure books actually are competitive against these other media types , and a big part of that is working hard to make books less expensive			0
' while we believe 35 per cent should go to the author and 35 per cent to @entity10 , the way this would actually work is that we would send 70 per cent of the total revenue to @entity10 , and they would decide how much to share with the author			2
' we believe @entity10 is sharing too small a portion with the author today , but ultimately that is not our call			2
' ebooks sell for around $ 15 in the @entity20 , which @entity1 says is too high			0
the online retailer is able to reduce that price but only by paying for the discount itself			0
by allowing bigger discounts and lower prices , it claims it could sell 1.74 times as many copies of the average book			0
quoted in @entity47 , writer @entity103 , the president of @entity20 's @entity105 , said : ' @entity1 is using pr to try to sway public opinion			0
' i do n't feel it is to writers ' benefit in the long term to start devaluing the product			0
not every book is going to sell that much more if you drop the ebook price			1
there is not an infinite demand for books			0

@entity124 reports that @entity1 demanded 50 **%** of the ebook price
