the missing @entity1 was hijacked on the orders of @entity3 and secretly landed in @entity4 , an expert has claimed in a wild new theory			1
@entity6 , a @entity7 science writer who spearheaded @entity9 's coverage of the @entity10 , has based his outlandish theory on pings that the plane gave off for seven hours after it went missing , that were recorded by @entity16 telecommunications company @entity15			1
@entity6 believes that hijackers ' spoofed ' the plane 's navigation data to make it seem like it went in another direction , but flew it to the @entity24 , which is leased from @entity4 by @entity25			1
however @entity6 admits in @entity26 that he does not know why @entity3 would want to steal a plane full of people and that his idea is somewhat ' crazy '			1
@entity6 contends a @entity10 could easily fit at the base possibility : @entity6 said that the plane would have landed in the dark , and had 90 minutes to either refuel and fly somewhere else or cover up before sunrise broke satellite : images taken from the sky show the disused airport , which is part of the @entity24 complex , where @entity6 believes @entity1 landed ' if @entity25 has the savvy to plan an insanely complex special operation , they also have a track record of implementing such schemes , ' @entity6 wrote on his website			1
' @entity4 lacks the means and technical savvy to carry out a sophisticated hijack , the same is not true of @entity25			1
' @entity25 is ( arguably ) the only country that stands apart from the @entity68 and yet is as technically advanced in the aerospace industry as the @entity7			2
' @entity6 admits he does not know why @entity3 would want to steal a plane full of people and that his idea is somewhat ' crazy '			1
' maybe he wanted to demonstrate to the @entity7 , which had imposed the first punitive sanctions on @entity25 the day before , that he could hurt the @entity68 and its allies anywhere in the world , ' @entity6 wrote in @entity26			1
' maybe what he was really after were the secrets of one of the plane ’s passengers			2
' maybe there was something strategically crucial in the hold			0
' or maybe he wanted the plane to show up unexpectedly somewhere someday , packed with explosives			2
' there ’s no way to know			0
' @entity6 also noted there were three @entity25 men onboard the flight , two of them @entity92 passport holders			1
@entity94 plot ? : @entity25 president @entity3 orchestrated the disappearance of flight mh370 as part of an attack against the @entity68 , an aviation expert has claimed space port : @entity1 registered its last satellite ' ping ' near @entity24 in @entity4 , @entity6 claims heading south : satellite data from @entity1 showed that the plane made several turns after the last radio call , before finally heading towards @entity107 the theory follows a new documentary that claims @entity1 was deliberately flown off course by someone in the cockpit			1
aviation disaster experts analyzed satellite data and discovered - like the data recorded by @entity15 - that the plane flew on for hours after losing contact			1
careful examination of the evidence has revealed that @entity1 made three turns after the last radio call , first a turn to the left , then two more , taking the plane west , then south towards @entity107			2
according to @entity123 , a world 's leading expert in the causes of aviation disasters , those turns ' strongly suggest ' someone in the cockpit deliberately flew @entity1 off course			1
' this accident has caught the attention of the world in a way i have not seen in a forty - year career in aviation , ' mr @entity123 says			0
the claims are being made in a new @entity137 documentary out next month where mr @entity123 and a team of experts try to solve the mystery of @entity1			2
this follows confident claims by the @entity144 co-ordinator of the search that the doomed jetliner will be found within the next few months			0
evidence : according to @entity123 , a world 's leading expert in the causes of aviation disasters , those turns ' strongly suggest ' someone in the cockpit deliberately flew @entity1 off course as the current search for the @entity158 plane is set to wrap up by the end of may , @entity155 commissioner @entity154 said he was hopeful his team would unearth the wreckage by then , @entity153 reported			1
but the @entity162 is remaining tight lipped about the issue , saying the @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity144 governments would be assessing what to do next			0
@entity1 vanished on march 8 , 2014 while travelling from @entity33 to @entity169 with 239 people on board			1
no trace of the jet has been recovered since then but mr @entity154 believes his team are close to discovering the wreckage			0
' i do n't wake up every day thinking ' this will be the day ' but i do wake up every day hoping this will be it , and expecting that sometime between now and may that will be the day , ' commissioner @entity154 told @entity180 ' it 's been both baffling and from our point of view unprecedented - not only the mystery of it , but also on the scale of what we 're doing to find the aircraft			0
' as we keep on pointing out , we do n't have a certainty only a confidence that we 'll find the missing aircraft			0
' the search for @entity1 has so far been fruitless , with the crash site initially thought to be in the @entity195 or @entity196 of @entity197			2
accident : relatives of passengers of @entity1 held placards during a protest demanding to know why the @entity167 government had announced recently that the fate of @entity1 was an accident but search efforts were then redirected to the southern part of the @entity208			2
this late start meant any trace of the wreckage on the surface of the ocean floor would have sunk and it is thought some of the debris would have appeared on the shores of @entity217 in @entity218			0
so far , they have been unsuccessful in tracking down any piece of the aircraft but experts were trying to predict its floating patterns to locate the wreckage site by considering ' how the aircraft would 've collided with the water '			0
the @entity162 , which , headed by @entity144 , is conducting the search says that so far the underwater operations have scoured 22,000 square kilometres of the ocean bed , equalling around 36 per cent of the priority search area			0
it is estimated that if there are no delays with vessels , equipment or from the weather , the underwater search will be mostly finished some time in may			0
the ' go @entity240 ' supply ship has remained in the area , 2,500km to the south west of @entity243 , western @entity144 , but three vessels involved in the underwater search have this week suspended operations to return to port in @entity144 for scheduled visits			0
despite months of searching in the area , there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far .			0
