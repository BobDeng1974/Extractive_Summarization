a former soldier who claimed to have fought off a @entity2 gang , like karate super-hero @entity3 , has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder after a judge ruled that his tales were ' totally incredulous '			1
the @entity8 were told of the night @entity9 had been at a bar in @entity11 , when he became involved in a fight with a gang of 12 armed with weapons in the 1970s			1
the @entity15 said he was able to take on each of the ' crazed lunatics ... screaming and yelling ' at him as they came with batons that had spiked two - inch balls attached to the ends			0
he detailed how he was able to escape with an injury to his elbow			0
mr @entity9 argued that such events left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and took the matter to the @entity8 for an appeal after it was initially rejected			1
@entity9 , a former soldier , who claimed to have fought off a dozen attackers like karate super-hero @entity3 ( pictured ) has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder , after a judge ruled that his tales were ' totally incredulous ' ' in relation to the @entity36 incident , the account mr @entity9 gave conjured up images of a scene out of a @entity39 or @entity3 ( pictured ) movie , mr @entity9 playing the role of the super hero , ' tribunal member @entity32 said on march 4 tribunal member @entity32 was not reasonably satisfied and consequently knocked back with mr @entity9 's claims on march 4			1
' in relation to the @entity36 incident , the account mr @entity9 gave conjured up images of a scene out of a @entity39 or @entity3 movie , mr @entity9 playing the role of the super hero , ' dr @entity32 said			0
' it is totally incredulous			0
' a number of psychiatrists gave evidence , as dr @entity32 concluded dr @entity52 's to be the most reliable			0
dr @entity52 questioned the legitimacy of the accounts of events provided by mr @entity9 , saying that the former soldier talks quite boastfully about punching and assaulting people while claiming to have been in fear in @entity2			1
dr @entity52 further opined that there is a high chance that mr @entity9 has an antisocial personality disorder , saying he ' fails to conform to social norms at times , and has gross impulsivity and marked irritability and aggressiveness '			2
the psychiatrist then stated that ' people with antisocial personality disorder tend to deceive and distort accounts '			0
dr @entity32 said there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in mr @entity9 's claims , which the digger acknowledged and attributed his earlier accounts of the incidents to his illness			1
but dr @entity32 handed down the decision that mr @entity9 was ' an unreliable witness '			0
' i have concluded that mr @entity9 has a sincere belief that his psychiatric illness / s are due to his experiences in @entity2 , however he is an unreliable witness , and he was not exposed to the events the diagnosis of @entity88 relies upon , ' dr @entity32 said			2
' i therefore find that on balance , mr @entity9 suffers from generalised anxiety disorder , antisocial personality disorder , and alcohol misuse			2
