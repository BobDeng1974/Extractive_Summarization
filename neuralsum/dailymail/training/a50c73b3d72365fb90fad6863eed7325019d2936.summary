by @entity0 published : 23:35 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 04:26 est , 23 may 2013 women experience more mental health problems than men due to the stress of juggling many roles , according to a new book			2
professor @entity7 , of the @entity8 , said the first systematic investigation of national mental health surveys showed psychological disorders are 20 to 40 per cent more common in women than men in any given year			1
stress related to pressure on women to fill many different roles is likely to be a major factor for higher rates of everything from depression to phobias , according to professor @entity7 , a clinical psychologist			1
the investigation found that psychological disorders are 20 to 40 per cent more common in women than men ' the biggest discrepancies occur in conditions for which we know the environment , rather than genes , makes the greatest causal contribution , ' he said			1
' it 's certainly plausible that women experience higher levels of stress because of the demands of their social role			2
' increasingly , women are expected to function as carer , homemaker , and breadwinner - all while being perfectly shaped and impeccably dressed			1
' given that domestic work is undervalued , and considering that women tend to be paid less , find it harder to advance in a career , have to juggle multiple roles , and are bombarded with images of apparent female ' perfection ' , it would be surprising if there were n't some emotional and psychological cost			2
' these are the kind of pressures that can leave women feeling as if they 've somehow failed ; as if they do n't have what it takes to be successful ; as if they 've been left behind			0
and those kinds of feelings can lead to psychological problems like anxiety and depression			0
' men have higher rates of alcohol , drug and anger problems , according to professor @entity7 ' the @entity73 : uncovering the @entity74 ' , published today discloses that women have higher rates of depression , panic disorder , phobias , insomnia , post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders			1
men have higher rates of alcohol , drug and anger problems , according to professor @entity7 and co-author @entity86 , a writer and editor			1
professor @entity7 is a professor of clinical psychology , a @entity91 ( @entity90 ) senior clinical fellow , in the @entity8 's @entity92 and an honorary consultant clinical psychologist at @entity94			1
he said traditionally it has been said that overall rates of mental health problems in men and women are the same ' but the evidence shows that this is simply not the case '			2
' overall , in the current environment women are bearing the brunt of mental health problems , ' he said			0
' but let 's be clear , even for problems that are more common in women - such as anxiety and depression - they also afflict very significant numbers of men			2
' so it would be wrong to categorise mental health troubles as essentially a female problem			0
rates of mental health problems are too high in both genders			0
' according to @entity121 , the mental health charity , around 300 people out of 1,000 will experience a mental health problem in @entity124 every year			0
around 230 of these will visit a gp , 102 will be diagnosed with a mental health problem , 24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service and six will become inpatients in psychiatric hospitals			0
while women are more likely to report psychological problems than men , professor @entity7 said this does not explain the overall gender differences			1
he acknowledged that the findings are bound to be controversial but said the issue can not be ignored because psychological disorders account for almost half of all ill - health in under 65s and affect up to nine million adults in the @entity124			2
in fact , professor @entity7 argues that the taboo around gender differences in mental health must be broken in order to tackle disorders more successfully in future			1
' given the extent of the burden on society and individuals alike , understanding what causes mental health problems , and thus being better placed to prevent and treat it , is vitally important , ' he added			0
' but our ability to do that is going to be hampered if we assume that gender is n't significant			0
in fact , it may often be a crucial contributory factor			0
' men and women are very much from the same planet but they may be breathing air of different qualities			0
if we ignore the potentially higher rates of psychological problems in women , we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to change the situation for the better			1

psychological disorders are 20 **%** to 40 **%** more common in women than men
investigation found women are increasingly expected to function as carer , homemaker and breadwinner
