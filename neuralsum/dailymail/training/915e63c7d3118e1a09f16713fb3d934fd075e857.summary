by @entity0 for @entity1 for 10 years , a siamese cat living in @entity3 has been leading a double life with two different families			1
now the two @entity7 families caught up in the cat 's deception are in talks to who gets custody of the pet			2
known as @entity15 to the @entity17 family and @entity18 to the @entity16 , the pedigree cat was bought by @entity19 and named @entity15 in 2000			1
he was named for his tendency to mingle and ms @entity19 said the family often got calls from neighbours telling them @entity15 was at their house			2
but soon he started disappearing more often and then the cat vanished all together in 2010 for four years , according to stuff.co.nz			1
@entity43 , @entity15 re-appeared on the roof of @entity46 ' glasshouse in may earlier this year after they had canvassed the neighbourhood with missing cat posters when he decamped			1
' i picked it up and realised it was @entity15			0
i was running scenarios through my head , wondering where he had been , ' ms @entity19 said			0
to make sure he would not disappear again , she had @entity15 microchipped and bought him another collar			0
but he went missing again , this time turning up a month later with the hair shaved off his leg and it was obvious he had recently been to see a veterinarian			0
it was revealed @entity15 / @entity18 was living with two separate families who live close to each other in the @entity7 suburb of @entity32 ms @entity19 concluded that someone else had been looking after him so the family put up more missing cat posters			1
a week later , another family contacted the @entity46 and soon it emerged their beloved cat had been living a separate life with the @entity75 who lived nearby			1
the reason why @entity15 went missing for four years was because the @entity75 had taken him with them when they moved away from @entity32 and the family had just recently moved back to the area			1
@entity80 had no idea the cat was owned by someone else until she came across one of the @entity86 ' missing cat posters			0
@entity18 - as he was known to the @entity75 - was owned by ms @entity80 's husband before they were married and he had taken the cat in after he thought he was a stray because it spent so much time at his place			1
' @entity18 is part of the family and been with us for nine years , we ca n't just push him away now			2
it 's emotional for us too , he loves us and always come back , ' ms @entity80 told stuff.co.nz			0
the siamese cat 's future is still unclear as both families figure out who will get custody of the cat , with both saying they want him to be happy			0
' it 's so difficult , we love him so much and want him to be happy but worried the family will move			0
@entity15 is 15 years old now and deserves to retire			2
he should n't have to try and reclaim territory , ' ms @entity19 said .			0

the cat was known as @entity15 to the @entity46 and @entity18 to the @entity75
he vanished from the @entity46 ' home in @entity7 , @entity3 in 2010
four years later , the @entity114 cat re-appeared on their glasshouse roof
it was then discovered he had been living at a nearby home with the @entity75
