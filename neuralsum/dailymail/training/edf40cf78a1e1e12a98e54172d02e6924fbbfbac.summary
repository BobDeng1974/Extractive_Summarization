two thirds of @entity3 's 2.7 million smokers are likely to die ten years earlier due to their habit , a new study has revealed			1
however smokers who quit by the age of 45 wipe away most of their increased death risk , the first large - scale , direct evidence on smoking and mortality in @entity3 has shown			1
researchers from @entity14 's @entity13 followed 200,000 @entity3 aged 45 and over for four years , finding death rates among smokers were about three times higher than in non-smokers			1

' the 45 and @entity31 , published in the journal @entity33 on tuesday , is the best large - scale evidence on smoking and death in @entity3 and confirms recent findings from studies in both the @entity39 and the @entity40 , prof @entity25 says			1
those who smoked 10 - a - day were about twice as likely to die early , while a habit of 25 - a - day raised the risk by up to fivefold ' it is a huge wake - up call for @entity3			1
we know smoking is the cause of a wide range of diseases but we now have direct evidence from @entity3 that shows just how hazardous it is			2
even ten cigarettes a day will double your risk of dying prematurely			0
