it will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind for 16 years and wo n’t happen again for a decade			1
but those hoping to witness friday ’s solar eclipse could be disappointed – as clouds may block their view			1
the dramatic partial eclipse begins at 8.30am and will reach its maximum point around an hour later			1
the phenomenon – in which the moon moves in front of the sun – will be most visible in more remote parts of the country , which are said to offer the perfect viewing environment			0
and the proportion of the sun covered will increase towards the north of the country , ranging from 84 per cent in @entity30 to 89 per cent in @entity31 and 93 per cent in @entity32			2
@entity33 is expected to have the best view , with the @entity35 seeing around 98 per cent of the sun hidden and @entity37 around 97 per cent			1
however , forecasters warn early predictions show there may be cloudier skies in the north of the @entity43 – which could ruin the view for astronomy enthusiasts			1
@entity46 , forecaster at @entity47 , said : ‘ the @entity48 will get the best of the breaks between clouds and it will get cloudier the further north you go			2
it ’s not the greatest situation			0
the @entity48 will see about 60 to 70 per cent cloud cover – which is enough to be able to see the sun. ‘ in the north the sky will be almost completely covered by cloud			2
however , it is still early and the situation could quite easily change by friday			2
it ’s luck of the draw at the moment			0
’ get out your glasses : special shades like this are a good bet for watching @entity43 's first great eclipse this century , with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not set to take place until 2026 the timeline for the eclipse in @entity31			1
first sight will come at 8.20am and maximum eclipse at 9.32am cloudy skies also meant spectators struggled to see the @entity43 ’s last eclipse on august 11 , 1999 , but the effect was still dramatic as the country was pitched into darkness			2
the next eclipse of similar magnitude will take place on august 12 , 2026 , with 95 per cent of the sun obscured			0
@entity43 will not see a total solar eclipse until september 23 , 2090			1
anticipating friday ’s event , @entity87 from the @entity88 said : ‘ we wo n’t experience totality [ of darkness ] in the @entity43 but it will still be memorable			1
‘ depending on where you are , up to 90 per cent of the sun will be covered over			0
‘ you ’d think everything would go virtually black , but it does n’t , it ’s about equal to a fair bit of high cloud in front of the sun. but it has this eerie quality , especially on a clear day			0
you think , hang on , it ’s getting darker , but there are no clouds			0
’ experts have issued a reminder that people must be aware of possible damage to their vision if they fail to take the necessary precautions while watching the phenomenon			0
as with normal daylight , people should avoid looking directly at the sun – even if it is partly hidden or they are wearing sunglasses .			0
