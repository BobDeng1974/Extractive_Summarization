by @entity0 last updated at 1:18 pm on 17th february 2012 @entity2 's top models have been banned from using sunbeds ahead of appearing on the catwalks at @entity5			1
leading model agencies have signed up to support a @entity7 for all their models as the four - day event opens today			1
the initiative comes in support of @entity14 's @entity13 campaign , which is warning @entity2 about the health risks of using sunbeds			1
bronzed : @entity18 model @entity17 tops up her tan ahead of a photo shoot - but while real sun tanning is safer than sunbeds , experts insist sunless tanning is the only safe method directors from 11 @entity28 model agencies including @entity29 , premier @entity30 and @entity32 have signed up for the zero tolerance policy on sunbed use to protect new and established models from the health and cosmetic impact of using the ultra-violet tanning beds			1
@entity14 based the proposed ban on findings that reveal the first time use of a sunbed before the age of 35 increases the risk of malignant melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer , by 75 per cent			1
models on the @entity51 catwalk this week sported light tans - difficult to achieve in winter without artificial methods			1
but @entity14 and model agencies are urging girls to use spray tans , not sunbeds using a sunbed once a month or more - something that many women consider to be minimal use - can increase the risk of melanoma by 50 per cent			1
@entity63 , managing director of @entity64 , commented : ' @entity64 is pleased to support the @entity65			0
' supporting this campaign makes perfect sense as the wellbeing of our models is of paramount importance and we take a serious approach to their health			1
dying for a tan : first use of a sunbed before the age of 35 increases risk of melanoma - the most dangerous form of skin cancer - by 75 per cent ' we do not advocate the use of sunbeds for any of our models , and recommend that they choose safer options if they require a tan - spray tans are easy to apply and can last a week			1
' it is well documented that uv from sunbeds can cause serious skin damage , especially in the under 35s			2
' @entity94 , the ceo of @entity95 commented : ' the welfare of our models is of the utmost importance to @entity95			2
using a sunbed once a month or more - something that many women consider to be minimal use - can increase the risk of melanoma by 50 per cent			1
' we hope that this will help to send out a strong message to young girls and guys that sunbeds will have a negative impact on their appearance			2
' we strive to support the health of our models and will never condone the use of sunbeds for any job ; instead we will always try to arrange for a spray tan should it be necessary			1
' @entity117 , co-founder of @entity118 , echoed this view : ' @entity118 pride ourselves on taking care of our models ’ welfare and strongly support the view that models should never use a sunbed			2
' @entity125 , @entity126 campaign manager at @entity14 , said : ' we ’re delighted that leading model agencies are backing our @entity13 ? campaign			1
' using sunbeds can make your skin coarse , leathery and wrinkly			2
the uv rays from a sunbed can also damage the dna in your skin			0
' over time , this damage can build up and may lead to melanoma , the most serious type of skin cancer			2
so , if you feel you must have a tan , it is safer to fake it			0
' after peaking in the eighties , sunbed use was thought to be heading towards a decline in the @entity28 , but prevalence of the artificial tanning beds on television shows such as @entity150 and @entity151 , the latter of which shows underage girls tanning on beds , and thanks to promotion by stars such as @entity158 , who frequently talks of using them , their popularity has had something of a resurgence			0
a current resurgence of the trend for tanned skin has only provided more pressure upon young girls			0
it is widely believed that @entity171 fashion designer @entity170 first popularised the suntan			0
in 1923 , she stepped off the @entity174 's yacht after having been on a @entity176 cruise sporting a deep bronze tan			0
previously , tanned skin had been the mark of the outdoor labourer , and therefore one from the lower classes			0
suddenly , when @entity170 dared to suntan , it became the mark of luxury , a status symbol for the wealthy upper - classes who could afford to tan out of season			0
a dangerous invention ? a @entity191 pr poses in one of the firm 's sunbeds at the ideal home exhibition in 1985			2
at the time , their solarium - one of the earlier models for use within the home , cost £ 799 then , most tans were achieved the natural way			1
but with the invention of mass produced ultraviolet sunbeds in 1978 , women could tan all year long ( an early version was invented 86 years earlier in 1891 by @entity207 , who created an @entity208 , said to have been installed by @entity209 in @entity210 and @entity211 to relieve his gout )			2
in the @entity214 , when affordable personal tanning beds entered the mass market , consumers could even tan from the comfort of their own homes			0
as more research was carried out , the medical industry realised that tans , and sunbed tans in particular , were a leading cause of melanoma , and a trend for using self - tanning creams and bronzing gels took over			1
as with all things fashion - related , the trend for a tan is cyclical , ebbing and flowing with the times			0
the so - called heroin chic look popularised by models and designers in the @entity236 that demanded skin be pale to the point of translucence has given way to the new brand of beauty for the noughties - one that puts high value hair , nails and tan being entirely artificial			0
what never changes , however , is just how dangerous a sunbed tan can be			0
the @entity250 campaign is urging all @entity2 to face the invisible damage , lurking beneath the skin , that is caused by sunbeds caused , by offering exclusive skin scans at skin clinics nationwide until march			0
