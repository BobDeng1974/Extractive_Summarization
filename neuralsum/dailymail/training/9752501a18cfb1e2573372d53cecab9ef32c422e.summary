our most ancient ancestors were battling climate change to survive droughts , freezing and flooding			2
and now a growing number of scientists believe that shifts in the @entity9 ’s climate are responsible for creating some of our most distinctive characteristics			2
their research suggests that large evolutionary leaps , such as the development of our bigger brains and ability to create and use complex tools , coincided with periods of volatile climate change			1

this conceptual image shows four stages of human evolution : @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 @entity35 , of @entity36 , admitted to @entity37 that the scientific theory is currently based on ‘ coincidence ’ but experts are examining ancient teeth and seafloor sediments to support the idea			2
the data could help scientists unravel just how climate may have sparked dramatic advances in our evolution and seems to support the idea that big leaps were not driven by our adaptation to one environmental change , but to a series of changes as the environment alternated between wet and dry			1
@entity57 , of the @entity37 's @entity58 , said that at least two major evolutionary ‘ leaps ’ can be linked to climate change			1
they happened around three million years ago when @entity62 - known as @entity63 - became extinct and @entity64 appeared , with fossils revealing the evolution of a larger brain and the very first tools			1

a drought is pictured dr @entity78 of @entity79 said there are many theories as to why climate change correlates with bursts of human evolution – and any one of them could be correct until more evidence is found			2
he suggested that humans may have developed larger brains to work out how to feed themselves in times of drought			2
he also said that conversely , in wet periods when lots of resources were available , females may have been more careful to select the most successful men as partners			0
@entity97 of @entity98 , thinks people moved around the land responding to environmental changes so that populations became isolated and evolved quickly in groups			0
the other example cited is between two and 1.5 million years ago , when @entity33 used sophisticated bladed axes , leading to early humans leaving @entity107			1
dr @entity57 says that both these events coincide with dramatic shifts in climate when wooded areas turned to grassland as the temperature warmed			0
he suggests that the change in environment three million years ago led to humans walking upright instead of climbing			1
dr @entity35 said samples taken from the sea floor along the coast of @entity107 show different layers of sediment that are darker in times of drought and light in wet periods			0
the cores show that every 20,000 years the climate swapped from wet to dry and the effect was very pronounced during the two important periods of early human evolution			2
@entity128 of @entity79 ( @entity79 ) said further evidence can be found in the @entity130 , which runs through @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
by studying the rock record , he found that lake basins were very sensitive to changes in climate approximately 2.7 million and 1.5 million years ago			1
three million years ago @entity62 , known as @entity63 ( a skeleton is pictured left and copy of the skull , right ) became extinct and @entity64 appeared , with fossils revealing the evolution of a larger brain and the very first tools			1
one expert says the evolutionary leap coincides with ' pulses ' in climate change dr @entity128 said : ‘ we found that these particular periods , or “ pulses ” when the lakes come and go correlate directly with major changes in human evolution			1
the two records are absolutely compatible			0
’ scientists have also looked at our ancestors ’ fossilised teeth to understand how their diet changed according with the climate			0
they found that early humans ate a varied diet , indicating they became flexible to cope with a changing environment			0
however , the research does not explain why a shifting climate may have triggered evolutionary leaps			2
dr @entity128 acknowledged any one of many theories could be correct , including the idea that humans had to develop larger brains to work out how to feed themselves in times of drought when nutrients were scarce			0
he also said that in wet periods when lots of resources were available , females may have been more careful to select the most successful men as partners , leading to smarter and stronger children			0
@entity97 of @entity98 , thinks people moved around the land responding to environmental changes so that populations became isolated and evolved quickly in pockets of the land			0
dr @entity128 said that rock samples from the @entity130 , which runs through @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 indicate that lake basins were very sensitive to changes in climate approximately 2.7 million and 1.5 million years ago , when a burst of human evolution took place			1
the lakes still disappear in times of drought and fill up with heavy rainfall today			0

research suggests evolutionary leaps such as the the development of human 's big brains , coincided with periods of volatile climate change
many scientists think the changes shaped our development and are *collecting* proof from bone and rock records to support their theory
data could help experts unravel how climate change sparked swift evolutionary development , for example , the use of complex tools by humans
an expert from the @entity37 claims the change in environment three million years ago led to humans walking upright instead of climbing
