@entity0 is hoping his @entity3 @entity2 victory has provided him with a launchpad to again reel in @entity5 - but is wary of @entity7 ’ technical gremlins returning to haunt him			1
@entity0 put behind him the furore of his feud with @entity5 two weeks previously in @entity12 to take a much - needed chequered flag at @entity14 on sunday			1
with six races remaining and 175 points up for grabs , @entity0 now trails @entity5 by 22 points , which may appear a slender margin but he knows there can be no room for error or further issues			1
already this season @entity0 has suffered from a cylinder failure in the opening race in @entity26 , brake failures in @entity28 and @entity29 and a fuel leak that caused a fire in @entity32			1
' i ’d like to think this win is a platform , but i have no idea what ’s going to happen forwards from here , ' said @entity0			1
' over the weekend i had quite a few problems , missed almost a whole session in @entity58 , then in qualifying in @entity60 the car would n’t start again , but fortunately it did			2
' as for the start sequence ( at the beginning of the race ) , it could have been a lot worse			0
that was the best it could ever be considering i did n’t have the launch			0
' dark side : but @entity0 has had a number of technical problems this season and fears they will continue rare smile : after his feud with @entity77 would have been delighted to see of his team - mate at @entity14 @entity79 returns to winning ways asked as to whether the power balance had again shifted in the wake of his win , @entity0 replied : ' potentially , maybe			1
' but these problems just keep popping up			2
@entity87 ( @entity86 , executive technical director ) said " it ’s just so unlucky , with all the engines it just keeps happening to yours "			2
' hopefully we ’ll rectify them			0
right now , i ’m just looking forward , head down , and i see no reason why i ca n’t be as fast moving forwards			0
' @entity5 ’s double mistake into the first chicane , the second of which came when he was being pressured by @entity0 and cost him the win , seemed to suggest he could be starting to crack under the strain of the title fight			1
unlucky : @entity86 told @entity0 that his engine is picking up more problems than any other moving forwards : @entity0 sees no reason why he can not keep up the speed that brought victory in @entity3 it has offered up further hope to @entity0 , although @entity5 is still in pole position given he has a lead to defend			1
' you can be relaxed when you ’ve a cushion like that , ' added @entity0			2
' he ’s still got 20 - odd points has n’t he ? jeez , if i had that and even if things did n’t go well , that ’s all right			2
that ’s probably where he is ( in his head )			0
' of course , it ’s not easy for anyone to be under pressure , and especially when i ’m pressuring someone			0
speedster : @entity0 wants to put pressure on @entity5 - and did his words constitute mind games ? big team behind him : @entity0 will rely on the @entity7 to sort out his engine if he wants to be champion ' even for me , it ’s hard when you have @entity139 ( @entity140 ) pressuring you , or ( @entity142 ) @entity141			1
that ’s just the way it is			0
' i ’m sure if it was the other way around it would have been very hard for me to have kept him behind			0
it ’s just the way it goes			0
' of course it ( the win ) is just a general positive , a big positive , and a step up the massive staircase i have to face			0
' sidelined : @entity5 veers off the track at @entity14 as @entity0 overtakes him before winning the race			1
