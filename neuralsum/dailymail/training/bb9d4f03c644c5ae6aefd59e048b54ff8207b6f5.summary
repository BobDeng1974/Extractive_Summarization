@entity0 has attempted to create better ties with the @entity2 and @entity3 by signing a new visa agreement for each other 's citizens			1
visitors to both countries will be able to stay for up to 10 years rather than one under a negotiation by the president , announced at the @entity11 in @entity12 today			1
but there are fears @entity0 's powers are beginning to wane on the global stage as well as at home after the @entity18 lost the power of the @entity20 during last week 's mid-term elections			1
he put on a bright face as he addressed business leaders at today 's summit where he set out to dispel the notion that @entity2 's interest in @entity37 should be a cause of concern for @entity3 's leaders			0
@entity12 has viewed @entity0 's engagement with trepidation out of concern the @entity2 wants to limit @entity3 's rise , but @entity0 insisted that ' one country 's prosperity does n't have to come at the expense of the other			2
' ' we want @entity3 to do well , ' @entity0 said			2
' we compete for business , but we also seek to cooperate on a broad range of challenges and shared opportunities			0
' under the visa agreement , due to be issued on wednesday , @entity2 and @entity3 citizens will be able to obtain business and short - term tourist visas valid for 10 years , up from one year currently			1
student and cultural exchange visas will be made valid for five years rather than just one year , @entity0 said			0
@entity0 walks to the stage where he attempted to make better ties with @entity3 and the @entity2 with announcement @entity0 has faced fresh criticism over his waning power after the @entity18 lost the power of the @entity20 during last week 's mid-term elections the negotiation will allow citizens to @entity2 and @entity3 to keep the same visa for 10 years rather than just one with the @entity70 hoping it will bring extra extra money in for the economy coming just hours after the president 's arrival in @entity12 - the first stop on his week - long trip to @entity3 , @entity79 and @entity80 , the announcement offered him an opportunity to portray the @entity2 and @entity3 as working in good faith			1
however the new visa plans may have only modest implications as it does not increase how long an @entity2 can remain in @entity3 or vice-versa			0
rather , it increases the length of time during which a visitor is permitted to enter the country - so a @entity3 citizen who visits the @entity2 every few years would be able to use the same visa for a decade , rather than having to reapply for a new visa every year			2
@entity0 puts on a cheery front as he addresses business leaders at the event , which is part of a week - long tour he set out to dispel the notion that @entity2 's interest in @entity37 should be a cause of concern for @entity3 's leaders @entity0 meets with @entity80 prime minister @entity102 today			1
he will also travel to @entity79 and @entity80 during his week - long trip to the region the @entity2 hopes the deal will lure more @entity3 travellers to the @entity2 - and with it , billions of dollars into the economy			1
the @entity70 said it could drive up demand that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the @entity2 , without sacrificing national security			0
about 100 million @entity3 travelled last year , but less than 2 percent of those visited the @entity2 but the announcement was set against a backdrop of doubt as critics say his support at home is diminishing			0
the @entity3 @entity119 says that ' @entity2 society has grown tired of his banality ' and claims @entity0 ' has done an insipid job , offering nearly nothing to his supporters '			0
at the same time , other signs pointed to a heightened sense of competition that have rankled relations between the world 's two largest economies			0
@entity0 stepped off @entity132 and onto a red carpet , where the honor guard lined his path to a limousine the @entity3 guardsmen form perfect lines waiting for @entity0 to step off the plane when he arrived today @entity3 is the opening stop of @entity0 's three - country tour that will test the president 's ability to play a commanding role on the world stage during his final two years in office only hours earlier , @entity0 was at the @entity2 embassy hosting heads of state from the 11 other countries — excluding @entity3 — that are pursuing a long - delayed trade pact			1
finalising the @entity152 is a cornerstone of @entity0 's much - touted effort to expand @entity2 influence and economic presence in @entity37 , but @entity3 has responded by pushing its own regional trade deal with many of the same nations			2
@entity2 officials said @entity0 would have further agreements with @entity3 to announce later during his three - day visit when he meets with president @entity163 , and the two leaders have common cause when it comes to combating climate change			2
but thornier issues were also on the agenda for @entity0 's meetings in @entity3 , including cybersecurity and @entity3 's aggressive posture toward its neighbors .			0

@entity0 is on a week - long visit of region and arrived in @entity3 today
he was speaking at the @entity11 in @entity12
there he declared new visa agreement allowing visitors to stay for 10 years
but it comes as president faces more criticism over his waning powers
