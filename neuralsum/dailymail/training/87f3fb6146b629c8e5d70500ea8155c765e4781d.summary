by @entity0 published : 19:32 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 31 december 2013 the @entity1 , facing a repeat of the demoralising @entity3 whitewash down under seven years ago , at least demonstrated more team unity on @entity5 than the dysfunctional 2006 - 07 side			1
all the squad and their partners attended the @entity10 function last night at the @entity12 waterfront restaurant that offered a prime view of the @entity15 fireworks			2
this contrasts with the splits in the camp under @entity20 ’s leadership when the captain went out on a boat with his testimonial committee chairman @entity24 and took with him three other members of the squad in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 plus agent @entity29			0
sticking together : the @entity1 team celebrated @entity31 together in @entity15 @entity20 wrote in his autobiography : ‘ the media made a big issue about us not celebrating the new year together as a team			1
why would we want to do that ? we ’d hardly spent an evening together during the rest of the tour so why would @entity5 be any different ? i told the lads to do what they wanted			0
‘ i ’d flown out everyone who had worked on my benefit committee the previous year and we had a great night on a boat in @entity15 harbour			0
we watched the fireworks and just for a few hours it felt like i was n’t on this tour from hell			0
’ the @entity10 claimed all the tour squad had been invited on to the @entity20 boat			0
attendance at last night ’s function at the same venue was optional but every player chose to go at some stage during the evening			0
the @entity57 saw in the new year as a unit watching the fireworks from their hotel in the @entity61			0
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- -- one of the many boats in @entity63 on @entity5 three years ago during the last @entity3 tour contained a number of cricket - loving tycoons and captains of industry , including @entity69 , sir @entity70 and sir @entity71			1
the chat concerned who , among them or their friends , could mount a much - needed challenge to @entity77 for the chairmanship of the @entity10			0
none emerged and @entity77 was re-elected unopposed for three more years in 2012			0
the sports honours committee meet in october to determine the new year gongs , which helps explain why retiring @entity1 chief selector @entity82 was rewarded with an obe for the three @entity3 victories on his watch			1
certainly @entity82 would not have been recognised for how the selections in his last @entity3 touring party have fared - especially with three giant fast bowlers having played one test between them			1
gong : @entity82 has been awarded an obe on the @entity92 list @entity1 look like they have already missed the big - money t20 boat despite inventing the format			1
there is likely to be room in the year for just two t20 competitions that will attract the world ’s best players and @entity57 ’s @entity100 has seemingly grabbed that second spot after the @entity102			2
big sucess : @entity1 batsman @entity104 is playing for the @entity105 in the @entity100 and it is proving a sucess the weather , the presentation , free - to - air tv coverage , the use of large stadiums for big crowds and slick entertainment around the cricket — such as motorbike stunts and the chance for a viewer to win a six - figure sum if a celebrity on a platform in the crowd catches a big hit — have all helped the @entity100 establish itself in the cricket calendar while the @entity10 are still working on their t20 revamp			1
strauss in school shift @entity126 , former @entity3 - winning @entity1 captain turned @entity128 pundit , is temporarily taking his eight - year - old son @entity129 out of @entity130 , whose former headmaster @entity131 has been found guilty of indecent assaults on pupils between 1959 and 1970			1
@entity126 ’s decision has nothing to do with his former school ’s past , which emerged during @entity131 ’s trial			2
@entity129 is being educated in @entity57 for one term as @entity126 is staying @entity140 until april having bought a house in @entity142 , @entity143 where his wife @entity144 comes from			2
staying @entity140 : former @entity1 captain @entity126 is staying in @entity57 after the ashes the senior @entity1 players received up to £ 60,000 each in bonuses for their ashes win last summer and the @entity57 are on course to collect extra payments of around that figure also if they complete a 5 - 0 whitewash			1
bonus : @entity156 , @entity157 and the rest of the @entity57 team will all receive bonuses for winning			0

@entity1 players celebrate @entity5 together on @entity15 *'s* waterfront
@entity1 selector @entity82 awarded obe after three @entity3 wins
@entity100 proves to be a hit with @entity168 fans
@entity126 to stay @entity140 once ashes are finished and takes son out of school
