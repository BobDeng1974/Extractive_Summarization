@entity2 ’s refusal to say @entity3 started the @entity4 makes them unfit for office , @entity0 said today			2
the @entity8 mayor condemned the party ’s education spokesman @entity9 for claiming it was ‘ crass ’ and ‘ ugly ’ to pin the blame for the @entity4 on @entity3			1
it marks an escalation in the political row over how @entity16 should mark this year ’s centenary of the outbreak of the conflict in 1914			1
@entity8 mayor @entity0 ( left ) accused @entity2 's @entity9 ( right ) of ' talking total twaddle ' by playing down the part played by @entity3 in the outbreak of the @entity4 @entity24 education secretary @entity23 last week attacked the left - wing academics for fuelling myths about the @entity4 , accusing shows like @entity28 of belittling @entity16 and clearing @entity3 of blame			1
mr @entity9 yesterday accused mr @entity23 of trying to use the @entity4 centenary to ‘ sow political division ’ , condemning ‘ ugly ’ and ‘ crass ’ attacks by the conservatives			1
he wrote in @entity36 : ‘ whether you agree or disagree , given the deaths of 15 million people during the war , attempting to position 1918 as a simplistic , nationalistic triumph seems equally foolhardy , not least because the very same tensions re-emerged to such deadly effect in 1939			0
’ mr @entity9 , an historian who was elected to the @entity42 in 2010 , said that the case put forward by mr @entity23 , @entity44 and @entity45 that the conflict ‘ was a necessary act of resistance against a militaristic @entity3 bent on warmongering and imperial aggression ’ overlooked internal opposition to @entity53 education secretary @entity23 said shows like @entity28 and @entity55 painted an incorrect picture of the conflict but mr @entity0 hit back today , accusing mr @entity9 of ‘ talking total twaddle ’ , adding : ‘ if @entity9 seriously denies that @entity3 militarism was at the root of the @entity4 , then he is not fit to do his job , either in opposition or in government , and should resign			1
if he does not deny that fact , he should issue a clarification now			0
’ writing in the @entity65 , mr @entity0 added : ‘ it is a sad but undeniable fact that the @entity4 – in all its murderous horror – was overwhelmingly the result of @entity3 expansionism and aggression			2
‘ that fact is , alas , not one that the modern @entity2 believes it is polite to mention			0
’ @entity70 appeared to back mr @entity0 today , insisting @entity16 ' should not be afraid ' to make clear why it needed to stand up to @entity3 aggression			1
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister ’s view is that the centenary of the @entity4 is an opportunity to do three things , one obviously to commemorate the fallen , second , there ’s an opportunity of course to learn about the impact the conflict had on our country and the world because of course there were very significant impacts on us as a society and as an economy as a result			2
‘ and thirdly of course to reflect on the achievement of peace for the most part , with some tragic exceptions obviously such as the @entity101 conflict in the 1990s , but for the most part on peace in @entity104 following the two conflicts which scarred the first half			0
‘ so there ’s an opportunity for us to do that , and i think we can do that without being afraid of saying it was right for @entity16 to respond to aggression and to enter the war on that basis			2
' so those are the things we can do , and we can do those without being afraid that it was right for @entity16 to respond in the way that it did			2
’ captain @entity120 : @entity121 as @entity122 , left , and @entity123 as @entity28 in the titular sit - com , which education secretary @entity23 blames for distorting attitudes about the @entity4 the political battle over how the @entity128 should be remembered has focussed in particular on whether the @entity130 sitcom blackadder should be shown in schools			1
mr @entity23 argued : ‘ the conflict has , for many , been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity28 , as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out - of - touch elite			0
even to this day there are left - wing academics all too happy to feed those myths			0
’ blackadder star sir @entity121 , who played @entity122 in the series , branded mr @entity23 ‘ very silly ’			1
sir @entity121 , a prominent member of the @entity2 who once sat on its national executive , said : ‘ i think mr @entity23 has just made a very silly mistake			1
it is not that @entity28 teaches children about @entity4			0
‘ when imaginative teachers bring it in , it ’s simply another teaching tool , ’ he told @entity150			0
‘ they probably take them over to @entity155 to have a look at the sights out there , have them marching around the playground , read the poems of @entity162 to them			0
and one of the things that they ’ll do is show them @entity28			0
