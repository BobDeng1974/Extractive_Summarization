it was the @entity1 project that captured the hearts of space enthusiasts the world over - could a team of scientists really re-gain control of a long - thought dead spacecraft ? in late may they wowed us all by making first contact , and now they ’ve proven their ambitions yet again by firing the thrusters on the 36 - year - old spacecraft			1
the team made first contact with the probe in late may and has now fired the thrusters on the vehicle , with a view to flying past the moon on 10 august the initial burn , which took place a few days ago , involved 11 ‘ pulses ’ of the spacecraft ’s hydrazine thrusters			1
@entity18 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity22 from a stable orbit point between our planet and the sun known as the lagrangian 1 , or @entity49			1
monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the interconnected sun - @entity22 system , which at its most turbulent can affect satellites around @entity22			1
in 1984 , it was given a new mission and called the @entity18			2
in september 1985 , it passed through the tail of @entity58 , making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a comet			0
it also went on to fly by @entity64 in march 1986			0
from 1991 until 1997 , when it was too far away for reliable communications , this satellite continued to investigate the sun. now it 's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to @entity22 in august			2
this had the goal of increasing the ‘ spin ’ of the spacecraft from 19.16 revolutions per minute to about 19.75 , almost exactly what the original mission specifications called for			0
‘ in other words : bullseye , ’ one of the lead scientists , @entity80 , writes at @entity82			0
the team of scientists were given the go - ahead by @entity86 to crowd - fund the revival of the seemingly ' dead ' spacecraft earlier this year			1
contact was last made with the spacecraft , called @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , in the late 90s			2
as it approached our planet , scientists had a brief chance to communicate with the 36 - year - old probe in an attempt to bring it back to life - which they managed to do in late may			2
‘ the @entity100 is pleased to announce that our team has established two - way communication with the @entity18 spacecraft and has begun commanding it to perform specific functions , ’ said @entity80 at the time			1
first contact with @entity18 was achieved at the @entity107 in @entity108 , which is continuing to be used as a means to communicate with the probe			2
the achievement was a collaboration with a number of other organisations and people including the staff at @entity116 and a team at the @entity118 in @entity119			0
in april the @entity117 - made up of the groups @entity82 , @entity121 , and @entity122 - undertook a successful crowd funding project to raise £ 74,000 ( $ 125,000 ) to rescue the probe			0
@entity86 also officially endorsed the @entity126 - based project and signed a space act agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s - era craft			1
this is the first time @entity86 has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again			1
' we contacted the spacecraft after recreating hardware that was discarded by @entity86 decades ago using command language that was recreated from old documents that were sitting in former employees ' basements , ' @entity137 told @entity145			0
he also revealed how they intended to use the spacecraft for science again , and to involve citizens in it in a way not attempted before			0
‘ the intrepid @entity18 spacecraft was sent away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind extending its mission of discovery to study two comets , ’ said former @entity86 astronaut @entity153			1
‘ we have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through this creative effort to recapture the @entity18 spacecraft as it zips by the @entity22 this summer			1
’ in march , amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and find out its route , raising hopes that the mission could be revived			0
the mission 's original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			1
once proving this was possible , the project is now using the @entity107 ( pictured ) in @entity108 to send commands to @entity18 launched in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity22 , @entity18 - 3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981			1
with remaining fuel and functioning instruments , it then was redirected to observe two comets			0
following the end of that mission , the spacecraft continued in orbit around the sun. it is now making its closest approach to @entity22 in more than 30 years			2
the goal of the @entity100 is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a gravitationally stable point between @entity22 and the sun known as @entity197 1 ( @entity49 )			2
once safely back in orbit , the next step will be to return the spacecraft to operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed			0
@entity100 's close approach provided optimal conditions to attempt communication			0
@entity86 said it had shared technical data with the amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from @entity18			1
the mission ’s original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			1
having done this , the project is using the @entity107 in @entity108 to send commands to @entity18			0
new data resulting from the project will be shared with the science community and the public , providing a unique tool for teaching students and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering			0
the data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36 - year old spacecraft .			0

@entity126 - based amateur group successfully fired thrusters on ' dead ' probe
the spacecraft will now be moved to fly past the moon on 10 august
in may the crowd - funded @entity100 ' talked ' with the spacecraft
but it has now also proved the thrusters work so it can be used for science
this is the first time @entity86 has given control of one of its craft to the public
@entity18 - 3 first launched in 1978 but has not been heard from since 1999
reviving the mission could help scientists better understand solar winds which can affect satellites and the *climate* on @entity22
