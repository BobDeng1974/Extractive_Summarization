drug possession is being decriminalised ‘ by the back door ’ , it has been claimed – with fewer than 1 per cent of those caught with narcotics going to prison			1
of the 148,000 people found with drugs last year , including heroin and cocaine , only 1,141 were sent to jail			1
the figures were even lower for those caught with @entity14 drugs - with only 541 in @entity15 and @entity16 imprisoned			1
some 64,000 cannabis users received nothing more than a ticking off			0
drug possession is being decriminalised ‘ by the back door ’ , it has been claimed – with fewer than 1 per cent of those caught with narcotics going to prison ( file picture ) critics said the figures showed drug possession was being decriminalised by stealth – despite the prime minister ’s insistence that drug use was ‘ never acceptable ’			1
the revelations come in the wake of a @entity37 report which demanded a radical shake - up of the @entity40 ’s drug laws			1
the @entity41 claimed the study , which compared drugs policies in different countries around the world , showed that relaxing the rules on banned narcotics did not increase the number of addicts			2
hailing the report as a ‘ dramatic blow ’ to hardliners , deputy prime minister @entity50 strengthened his support for decriminalisation of drugs for personal use – including deadly @entity59 substances			1
@entity61 dem home office minister @entity60 blasted strict punishments for possession in the @entity40 and criticised the authorities for ‘ banging up ’ those caught with small amounts of drugs			1
but an analysis of police arrests for possessing drugs revealed only a tiny proportion – just 0.8 per cent – received a custodial sentence , even though there is the threat of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for possessing @entity59 substances			2
of the 148,000 people found with drugs last year , including heroin and cocaine , only 1,141 were sent to jail			1
the figures were even lower for those caught with @entity14 drugs - with only 541 in @entity15 and @entity16 imprisoned			1
some 64,000 cannabis users received nothing more than a ticking off in 2013 - 14 , police issued penalties for drug possession to around 148,189 people , according to @entity37 and @entity94 figures			1
some 63,967 were let off with a cannabis warning – where a culprit is given a stern talking to by a police officer in the street			0
a further 14,768 received penalty notices – on - the - spot fines – ordering them to pay a minimum £ 60			2
and another 31,368 were given a caution – effectively a slap on the wrist			0
of those hauled before a court 38,120 were sentenced , of which 1,141 were sent to prison			0
@entity108 , chief executive of think - tank @entity109 , said : ‘ when people like the @entity41 say that our regime is too severe and needs relaxing , they are wrong			2
' we have been trying a drugs policy of ultra-relaxation			0
i find it very puzzling			0
we have already got as close to decriminalising possession of drugs as is possible without actually taking the final step			0
‘ i do n’t want to see people in prison for possessing a small bit of cannabis			0
they need educating and treating			0
but the @entity41 are going even further with their calls for decriminalisation			0
‘ the point of the law is to protect the weak , the vulnerable and the easily addicted and decriminalisation would see them exploited by drug dealers			0
’ @entity133 , director of the @entity135 think - tank , said : ‘ it is completely false to pretend that we have so far been fighting a tough war on drugs			1
‘ this decriminalisation by the back door means people see very little risk associated with trying drugs – and then potentially becoming hooked			2
’ @entity145 crime minister @entity144 said : ‘ @entity50 ’s proposal is nonsense			2
’ a @entity37 source said : ‘ banning prison sentences for these individuals will make it harder to get them into treatment programmes and lead to higher crime rates			0

figures include those found with heroin and cocaine
numbers were even lower for those caught with @entity14 drugs - with only 541 in @entity15 and @entity16 imprisoned
critics said figures showed drug possession was being decriminalised by stealth – despite @entity170 ’s insistence that drug use was ‘ never acceptable ’
