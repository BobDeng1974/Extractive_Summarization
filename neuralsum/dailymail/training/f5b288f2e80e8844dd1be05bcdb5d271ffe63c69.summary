red captain @entity30 also features , sitting proudly in front of his ' 688 ' appearance shirt between @entity50 columnist @entity29 and @entity51 winger @entity31			2
@entity30 , who will be out of contract in the summer , has been linked with a move away from @entity3 after a slow start to the 2014 - 15 @entity56 season , but @entity34 insists the club want @entity30 to stay			1
' we have a fantastic dialogue with @entity30 and his representatives , ' said the @entity44 managing director , speaking at an event to announce the £ 100million redevelopment of @entity3 's @entity8 will begin on monday			1
' we have made an offer to @entity30 and we have to be respectful to him and where he is in his career			1
there is no pressure from our side			2
' the one thing i can say is he will always be a part of this football club whatever his decision			2
' he is an iconic part of this football club and we want to see him here for many years - and that is not just about his playing career			2
' he has been a fantastic servant to this football club and we do n't expect that to change			2
' if you ask @entity30 he will say he wants to be here as long as he can			2
' @entity1 is soon to add more seats to its famous and iconic home @entity3 - to look like this @entity3 could look like this should its potential 13,000 seats be added to bring its capacity to about 58,800 the cost of the redevelopment has been funded internally by owners @entity93 in the form of a loan which will be paid back over five years			1
@entity34 also expects new sponsorship opportunities to be generated by the stand with the possibility of naming rights for all or parts of the stand likely			0
and while crippling debt under the previous regime of @entity105 and @entity106 took the club to the brink of administration , there will be no impact on squad strengthening			0
' the funding has been put in place by the owners , we have n't gone outside , and it will come in as a loan and that is great news because it minimises the cost and allows us to move very quickly , ' he added			0
' it is an effective way rather than going to a bank and paying escalating interest prices			0
' it should n't affect squad development as we built this economic model on the basis it was important to find a solution where we could maintain our level of investment throughout the build			0
@entity3 is soon to be altered after @entity1 won permission from the city council in september @entity35 looks on as @entity137 passes the ball during a @entity1 training session on thursday 45,522 - @entity3 's current capacity 58,800 - @entity3 's potential new capacity 8,500 - phase one to extend the @entity8 4,500 - phase two to extend @entity3 end £ 75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season £ 260m - cost of overall regeneration in @entity3 ' it can only improve once the construction is finished and the money is paid ( off ) then it is additional revenue so it is additional revenues to invest in the team			1
' it should n't have any negative effect on investment in the football team			0
' that is why we do this			0
we obviously want more of our fans to come through the door each week but we want to compete at the highest level with our biggest competitors			0
' they have a bigger capacity and therefore bigger revenue so can invest bigger amounts so this is one of the final pieces in the jigsaw for us			0
' there have been protests at @entity3 over ticket prices in recent weeks but @entity34 insisted the new development would allow for a greater spread of prices			1
' we have said all along we recognise there needs to be some affordable pricing and tickets in the stadium - that is the case today and maybe there can be more of that , ' he added			0
' it is about finding the right balance as transfer fees and wages are going up			0
' @entity34 also confirmed the @entity189 would be placed into storage and a temporary feature installed at the stadium until construction is completed			1
@entity196 ( right ) , @entity194 ( centre ) and @entity31 go through their warm - up during the session			0
