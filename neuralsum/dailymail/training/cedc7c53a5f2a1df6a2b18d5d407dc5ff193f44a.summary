by @entity0 , @entity1 a senior citizens ' center told @entity4 today that it has tried to lure a group of troublesome pensioners away from a branch of @entity8 's where they have spending sunrise to sunset hogging booths - but that they refuse to leave			1
president of the @entity14 said on wednesday that he provides coffee and snacks for the senior citizens from 8.30am to 5pm every day but that ' they do n't come '			1
staff at the @entity8 's franchise in @entity1 are becoming increasingly frustrated with the @entity21 pensioners who pass hours gossiping at the window - seat tables amid piles of newspapers but buying very little			1
some of the gang eat meals at the seniors ' center - then head for the golden arches			0
a @entity8 's branch in @entity32 , @entity30 is battling a group of elderly @entity34 whom they say hog the tables for hours on end but buy very little the @entity39 in @entity32 where the elderly patrons have frustrated the restaurant chain by taking up all the seats , often for hours at a time many customers bypass the @entity39 because they know there will be no seats mr @entity14 even undercuts @entity8 's budget prices by asking just a 25c donation for the refreshments			1
he said : ' i think they like it [ @entity8 's ] because it allows them to have their own chats away from the senior center			1
it gives them independence and freedom			0
' management have been forced to call police to move on the ever - evolving group as they are driving away business			2
some customers have asked for refunds because there is nowhere to sit			0
@entity67 , 64 , who was enjoying a coffee , fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in @entity8 's , told @entity4 that she understood it was bad for business but that they needed a place to go			1
she said : ' it is open so early and stays open until after dark when it 's late			0
it 's warm and the old people like to have a place to meet and talk together			0
' the elderly @entity34 ' allegiance to the neon - lit branch is especially peculiar because of the other options available to the chatty seniors			0
the elderly patrons return to the @entity39 because they enjoy the long opening hours and find it convenient , patrons said today @entity91 offers the @entity21 community breakfast and lunch daily			1
they have even started offering coffee for 25c to ease the @entity39 's battle the @entity97 in @entity32 also offers breakfast and lunch for the elderly every day along with language and exercise classes			1
mr @entity14 said that although he understands that @entity8 's must have trade , some seniors told him that the fast - food joint wants them to drink their coffee in 20 minutes which he thinks is too short a time period for elderly people			1
the president also offered to provide buses for groups of elderly people to join them at the seniors ' center which has locations in @entity32 and @entity117			1
however @entity67 told @entity4 that the senior center was not open for long enough to suit her and her friends ' needs			1
the battle between the pensioners and @entity39 has escalated over the past few months with the police receiving four 911 calls since november about the group			2
a police source said that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems			0
the @entity39 's in @entity32 is the popular hang - out spot for some of the elderly @entity21 community in the area an elderly customer leaves the branch where employees are becoming frustrated with how many hours the pensioners spend hogging the tables however the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again			1
police could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and the restaurant requested , but hope the matter could be worked out before that stage			2
it appears that the group of men , and some women , are drawn to the @entity39 on the corner of @entity154 and @entity155 , because it offers a convenient meeting spot from their homes			0
however beyond these reasons , many can not explain why they love to meet at @entity39 so much			0
local people admit they bypass the location - which only has around ten booths and a few counter places - because there are never any seats			0
@entity166 , who was pushing an elderly woman in wheelchair whom she cares for , said they head to a @entity39 's further away because it is always so busy			0
she says : ' some people sit there all day long and and there 's no room for the wheelchair			0
' @entity32 resident @entity177 said : ' i think that place must do no business			2
people go there to read the newspaper			0
i go shopping for two , three hours and it 's always the same people sitting in the same places when i return			2
' the elderly people sometimes alternate with a @entity189 nearby on @entity190 which has more space and community boards inside for customers in @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity21			2
@entity196 , who owns the @entity8 's franchise , said in a statement : ' i 'm sure you can imagine any business would find this situation to be difficult when customers prevent other customers from enjoying the restaurant			1
' we continue to work to resolve this situation and create an environment so customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so			0
