by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 07:40 est , 19 july 2013 campaign : @entity2 , 48 , has been jailed for 14 weeks after being convicted of racially aggravated harassment a neighbour from hell has been jailed after waging a five - year racist hate campaign against a @entity8 man living next door			1
@entity2 , 48 , repeatedly called @entity10 a ' kraut b * * * * * d ' during @entity13 - like rants , as well as planting poppies in his back garden and draping a @entity16 over the neighbours ' shared shed in @entity18			1
the campaign of abuse from @entity21 , which dates back to august 2008 , led to him being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison at @entity23 after he was convicted of breaching a restraining order and ignoring an earlier suspended jail term			1
the former @entity27 candidate was also given a new , two - year restraining order			1
on one occasion @entity21 built a display of poppies and flags then placed it so only mr @entity10 , 51 , and his @entity35 born - partner @entity34 , 57 , could see it			1
another time when mr @entity10 protested at his neighbour ’s conduct , @entity2 retorted : ' f * * * * * g kraut , get back to f * * * * * g kraut land - remember @entity43 ? ' @entity44 was eventually given a restraining order banning him from contacting mr @entity10 and miss @entity34 after he was convicted of racially aggravated harassment			1
but he was arrested again after posting a rambling clip of himself on @entity48 in which he holds up a dvd claiming it was ' evidence ' that his neighbours had been ' spying on him ' with a @entity53 camera			0
police were initially called to deal with @entity2 in 2008 after he flew into an expletive - ridden rage when mr @entity10 objected to his @entity16 being draped over their joint garden shed			1
mr @entity10 , a personal assistant who has lived in the @entity35 for 23 years , and miss @entity34 were preparing to go away for a week when they saw @entity2 trying to hang the flag over the shared building			1
mr @entity10 went out to tell @entity2 he did n’t want it hanging over his property and threatened to take the @entity16 down himself if his neighbour left it up			1
but furious @entity2 vowed to re-hang the flag on the side of his house in @entity67			1
during a 20 minute rant @entity2 yelled : ' if you come into this f * * * * * g garden you wo n’t get out alive because i ’ll kill you			1
' you are a ‘ f * * * * * g kraut , get back to f * * * * * g kraut land			1
' the victim later told a court hearing : ' he tried to attach the flag to the side of the house but it would n’t stay up and he lost his cool			0
it was the worst abuse that i have ever heard			2
he said " go back to kraut land you kraut bastard " , and " remember @entity43 "			2
' it carried on for about 20 minutes			0
he then took a @entity16 down and put a @entity88 flag up and put the @entity16 out of his window outside			2
' it made me feel terrible and no - one should get away with someone talking like that			0
it made me feel upset			0
' @entity34 went round to his house to see how we could resolve matters			0
he then came round apologising and crying and brought a box of @entity101 for us			0
i have lived here for a number of years and people have said funny comments and what he said about @entity43 was fine - it was just the other words that he said			0
' i would n’t have called the police if he had just said " remember @entity43 "			2
i called the police because the other things that he said			2
' in 2009 @entity2 was fined £ 125 and ordered to pay £ 50 pounds compensation to mr @entity10 for harassing the couple			2
but last year he was back in court after putting poppies and flags outside the victim ’s property on @entity129 - then adding to the display over the next four months			2
when miss @entity34 asked @entity2 to remove part of it from the shared wall last month , he replied : ‘ @entity134 '			1
@entity135 : @entity21 's @entity8 neighbour and his @entity35 - born partner said the 48 - year - old 's behaviour had had a ' devastating ' impact on their lives expletives : @entity2 's racist rants at his neighbour call to mind the tv character @entity13 , whose deranged goose - stepping in front of @entity8 guests is one of the most famous scenes in @entity151 she told another court hearing : ' the reason the flags and poppies are facing into our garden is because @entity10 is @entity8			1
' @entity2 wants to change this to make it look like we ’re against the poppies and flags , which is n’t true			1
' that display originally appeared on the front wall facing to the road to mark @entity129 , which is right and proper			2
' but some weeks after that it was placed on the dividing wall facing our garden			1
' if you look at it from @entity21 ’s garden you could n’t see anything , it was solely for us to look at			2
we are private people who never wanted any of this			0
' it ’s had a devastating impact on our lives and we just want to get back to being private individuals			0
i just want the harassment to stop			0
' in may 2012 @entity44 was given a 12 - month restraining order preventing him from making direct or indirect contact with mr @entity10 or miss @entity34 and forbidding him mentioning or referring to them on the internet via social networking , blogging and discussion forums			1
he also received a 12 month suspended sentence with a 12 - week curfew			0
but the following november he posted a video on @entity48 in which he was seen holding up a copy of a dvd which contained footage of a cctv camera installed on mr @entity10 ’s house			0
defence lawyer @entity197 said : ' mr @entity2 has his rant on the video because he was not able to play the dvd at his earlier trial			2
he had fallen out with his neighbours and is not the most popular person in the area			0
' he held a genuine belief that he could have his rant without specifically referring to them			0
' but passing sentence district judge @entity206 told @entity44 : ' it ’s clear to me this was a deliberate breach of an order imposed to try and deal with the problem your neighbours suffered from your behaviour			0
' the restraining order was entirely appropriate			1
it ’s blatantly obvious that your behaviour amounted to a breach of that order - you caused the action so you have to take the consequences			0
' while you co-operated in regard to the community aspect of the sentence , the aggravating factor is is that your behaviour was identical to the behaviour that made you the subject of the order in the first place			0
' it ’s clear to me that immediate custody is appropriate in the circumstances			0
