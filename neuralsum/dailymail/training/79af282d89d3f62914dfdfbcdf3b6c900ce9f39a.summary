by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 9 september 2013 mayor @entity1 has tried to clarify his remarks in an interview where he alleged that one of the democrats trying to replace him is running a ' racist ' campaign			1
@entity1 said that former public advocate @entity7 was running a campaign that was based around ' class warfare and racist '			1
' well no , no , i mean , he ’s making an appeal using his family to gain support			0
i think it ’s pretty obvious to anyone watching what he ’s been doing , ' @entity1 said in an interview with @entity18			2
modern family : @entity1 blasted @entity7 's decision to regularly feature his wife @entity21 ( left ) and their daughter @entity22 ( center ) during the campaign @entity26 , who is leading in the polls going into tuesday 's @entity29 primary , is white and his wife @entity21 is @entity30			1
they have two children and their son @entity33 - who has a very prominent afro - has been featured in a number of his father 's ads. altering the words : outgoing mayor @entity1 had an injection added to the quote so that it is clear he said ' well , no , no , i mean ' before saying that he thought @entity7 's campaign was racist ' i do not think he himself is racist , ' @entity1 said			1
' it ’s comparable to me pointing out i ’m @entity48 in attracting the @entity48 vote			0
you tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about			0
' @entity1 's aides contacted @entity18 shortly after the article was first published on friday saying that the quote was missing an interjection			2
originally the quote did not have ' well , no , no , i mean ' and the @entity18 editors said that it was ' inaudible in our audiotape of the interview , which was conducted over speakerphone '			0
@entity26 's daughter @entity22 came to his defense at a rally on saturday , saying : ' i would say that 20 years ago , my dad did not know he was running for mayor , and he did not seek to marry a black woman to put her on display '			1
according to @entity72 , @entity26 responded at the same campaign event : ' all i can say is , i hope the mayor will reconsider what he said			1
i hope he ’ll realize that it was inappropriate , and i think the people of this city are ready for us to move forward together			0
' that togetherness is a point of contention - at least for @entity1 - as he said that @entity7 based much of his platform around the idea that @entity86 is a ' tale of two cities ' , turning the famous title into a slogan			1
' i ’ve never liked that kind of division , ' @entity1 said during the interview			2
' tearing people apart with this “ two cities ” thing does n’t make any sense to me			0
it ’s a destructive strategy for those you want to help the most			0
he ’s a very populist , very left - wing guy , but this city is not two groups , and if to some extent it is , it ’s one group paying for services for the other			0
making a statement : @entity26 's son @entity33 has been featured prominently in the campaign and has spoken in a number of his father 's commercials ' it ’s a shame , because i ’ve always thought he was a very smart guy			1
' his criticism of @entity7 did not stop there			2
' and he does n’t have any ideas			0
“ i ’m gon na raise the taxes			0
” you know that @entity123 , under no circumstances , nor the governor , under any circumstances , is going to allow that ! so come up with some real ideas , @entity126 ! ' @entity1 said			2
@entity1 has been careful not to give an official endorsement to any of the candidates running to replace him , though he has worked very closely with city council speaker @entity130 for the past seven years			2
down to the wire : @entity26 ( right ) is leading the @entity29 race , and @entity130 ( left ) is now in third place after leading for much of the beginning months the closest he came to giving her an endorsement came earlier in the @entity18 interview when he said he supported the @entity138 ' decision to endorse @entity139 as the @entity29 candidate			1
it could not be considered a full show of support , however , as he also said they were right to choose @entity145 as their pick for the @entity149 candidate			0
at the beginning of this year 's long mayoral campaign , @entity139 was very much seen as the person to beat , leading the five - person @entity29 race the longest			1
now , @entity7 has 39 per cent of the @entity29 vote heading into tomorrow 's primary			1
former comptroller @entity157 follows him with 25 per cent of the vote , and @entity139 is in third place with 18 per cent .			0
