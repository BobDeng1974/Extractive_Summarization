relief : @entity13 and @entity18 heard that their son @entity20 's murder conviction had been vacated this morning overwhelmed : @entity7 , pictured in prison , was told over the phone that his 40 - year sentence had been vacated according to the ruling today , the state now has 15 days to decide whether he will face a retrial			1
if no decision is made in that time frame he will be unconditionally discharged			2
' it 's amazing , ' mrs @entity18 told @entity29 , which featured the case on @entity31			0

@entity46 , who had no recollection of his movements on the night mr @entity9 died , told police he believed he and @entity7 , who had been out together in the area that night , may have been responsible			1
@entity7 has consistently denied he was involved but , despite no motive or evidence linking him or @entity46 to the crime scene , he was sentenced to 40 years in prison			1
in 2010 @entity46 , who still has no memory of the night in question and is serving a 25 - year sentence , said @entity7 was not involved			1
no evidence links the men to footprints , hair and finger prints at the scene , but police have not named any other suspects in the case			1
@entity7 , who is now 29 , heard of the decision over the phone in prison			1
' i kind of felt like i was n't awake - been dreaming of it so long , ' he said			2
' my reaction - it 's not - would n't be like " yay bouncing off the walls " , cause in reality i know it 's the beginning of another battle			2
even though we crossed a huge hurdle , i do n't feel like i have my life back			0
' the cautious optimism of the young man is understandable for someone who was 21 when he was sentenced to 40 years for a murder his friend @entity46 had implicated him in , despite @entity46 not remembering any details of the night in question			0
despite his consistent denials and no physical evidence linking him to the murder scene , @entity7 had his hopes raised and dashed by several appeal hearings			1
' under the facts and circumstances of this case , we conclude that @entity7 did not receive a fair trial , ' judge @entity93 wrote in a summary of today 's ruling			1
' his verdict is not worthy of judicial or public confidence			0
' the decision was celebrated on the @entity104 , with a post that read : ' looks like we 'll need to change the name of this page to " @entity109 " @entity7			1
' the post ' liked ' by more than 14,000 of the young man 's supporters in just a few hours			0
celebration : details of the successful appeal were posted on the @entity104 page appeal : @entity7 has always denied that he was involved in the murder of @entity9 the details of his case have concerned legal experts for years			1

september 2013 @entity7 's case goes back to the @entity150			1
november 5 , 2013 the appeals court vacates @entity7 's sentence , paving the way for him to be freed within 15 days			1
@entity7 's conviction was based on the testimony from witnesses @entity139 , a janitor , and @entity46 , who feared he may have been involved after seeing a photofit of the suspects			1
with his freedom finally in sight , @entity7 's attention is now focused on @entity46 who implicated him and is serving 25 years for second - degree murder			1
' i believe he is totally innocent [ too ] , ' @entity7 told @entity29			2
' i do n't see how he could have been at the crime scene			2
i just do n't think it 's possible			0

@entity46 told police the pair , who had been 17 at the time , had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question			0
after reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved , saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him			2
in his police interviews @entity46 , who was a drug user , was unable to give details of the crime , wrongly stating that mr @entity9 had been strangled by a shirt , or a bungee cord , before the detective questioning him tells @entity46 it was a belt			0
he claimed however , that he struck the editor once , before @entity7 strangled him			2
' the police threatened me to implicate @entity7 or else i would be solely responsible for @entity9 â€™s death and be charged with first - degree murder and possibly sentenced to death , ' @entity207 said in an affidavit			1
confess : a mug shot of @entity46 , right , who said he was involved after seeing a photofit , right , in a paper memory loss : @entity46 , who says he can not remember the night of the murder , recently retracted his statement that @entity7 was involved despite fingerprints , a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching @entity46 or @entity7 , police arrested them			1
' everything is wrong about this case , everything 's wrong about it			0
it makes absolutely no sense , ' @entity230 , who worked on @entity7 's appeal , told the court			1

this is after reading the newspaper article in october and this is kinda what i put together with what could 've happened			0
