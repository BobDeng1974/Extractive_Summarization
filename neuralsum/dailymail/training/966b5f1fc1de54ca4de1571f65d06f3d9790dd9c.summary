by @entity0 frequent use of ' text speak ' - such as gr8 and m8 - is eroding school pupils ' ability in written @entity6 , a leading head has said today protecting standards of @entity6 from the influence of text message and social media slang is one of the biggest challenges facing teachers , a leading headmistress has suggested			1
@entity16 , head of a top private girls ' school in @entity18 , warned a generation of children are leaving school without a proper grasp of spelling and grammar because of the impact of so - called textspeak			2
youngsters are also in danger of growing up with limited vocabularies because they spend so much of their free time on sites such as @entity32 and @entity33 instead of reading			2
mrs @entity16 , of @entity34 where fees are up to Â£ 30,000 - a - year , said government plans to introduce a maths qualification for sixth - formers who choose not to take an a-level in the subject were poorly thought through , and suggested an @entity6 assessment would be more useful			0
her remarks follow complaints from teachers that pupils increasingly use abbreviations and colloquialisms in school work and tests			1
examples highlighted by @entity6 staff include ' ur ' for ' your ' , ' m8 ' for ' mate ' and ' i donno huu u r ' for ' i do n't know who you are '			0
in her latest blog , mrs @entity16 wrote : ' if we are going to make all students carry on with one subject at sixth form , why not @entity6 ? ' our @entity6 skills are constantly on display , often making the difference between landing a job and having a misspelled application filed in the bin			1
' with the continuing reliance on technology , " textspeak " is eroding hard - learned skills in such basic areas as spelling and grammar			2
research from @entity78 showed pupils who made fewer punctuation mistakes when texting tended to be better at spelling ( library image ) common phrases written by @entity83 innit - is n't it @entity85 @entity86 phat - good sentences written by @entity83 ' i noe u dnt noee mii , i donno huu u r ' - i know you do n't know me , i do n't know who you are @entity94 was ' majorly bad ' @entity95 was ' pure mental ' ' perhaps this is the area we should be seeking to protect above all else			1
a command of our own language in today 's competitive world is essential			2
' she added : ' we should teach @entity6 in a traditional way			0
the correct use of grammar and spelling is important but there is going to be a whole generation which is not necessarily able to do that			0
' @entity109 is having an inevitable impact on this generation and they need to realise when it 's appropriate to write the correct response to a question			0
' if youngsters are not reading in the same way , and if they are spending a lot of time using social media , i wonder how much new vocabulary they are exposed to			0
' a poll of 500 teachers found that many youngsters used colloquialisms in formal written work , with phrases such as ' @entity95 was pure mental ' and ' @entity129 was a numpty was n't he ? '			1
@entity131 and a-level examiners have also warned that text message slang is appearing in students ' answers , revealing how youngsters are becoming careless in their use of it			1
meanwhile studies have shown a tentative link between frequent text messaging and poor written @entity6			1
an @entity145 study , by @entity143 , detected a decline in scores in grammar tests if text messages contained lots of shortened words			1
mrs @entity16 also suggested the syllabus for the planned sixth - form maths exam should be more practical			0
' i would like to see more attention paid to essential practical aspects such as financial and household management and a clear understanding of the sometimes bewildering world of interest rates and mortgages , ' she added .			0
