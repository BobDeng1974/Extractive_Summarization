sentiment is a limited currency in horse racing as @entity3 has found out this summer			1
the goodwill which carried her @entity5 stable through the second half of last season after the death of her much - loved husband sir @entity9 has largely been replaced by a more pragmatic mood			1
winners are the only commodity which count in a sport where you can go out of fashion faster than last summer ’s @entity19 frock			0
@entity20 , here in may 's @entity22 in @entity23 , is third favourite in the @entity25 but an ally entwined in the final magnificent chapter of sir @entity9 ’s career has quite literally kept the @entity31 flag flying			1
@entity3 ensured tradition was maintained after @entity34 ’s not - so - little brother @entity20 won the @entity35 at the @entity36 in may by flying the @entity9 family standard above her @entity31 stable			1
the colt subsequently secured a second success at the highest level in the @entity42 de @entity41			0
but on saturday at @entity19 , @entity20 could secure a win of infinitely more significance in the @entity46 - the race @entity34 won in 2012 , 12 months after he had landed the two - furlong shorter @entity48 on the same stage of @entity51 champions day			1
the five - year - old , owned by @entity53 , is 9 - 2 third favourite behind @entity56 - trained 11 - 8 favourite @entity57 , the @entity56 gelding beaten under two lengths by the slow - starting @entity34 on an emotionally - charged afternoon when @entity9 admits her heart nearly stopped from nervous excitement			1
lady @entity62 , carrying on the work of her late and great husband sir @entity9 , with @entity20 @entity3 , who runs @entity34 ’s half sister @entity65 in the @entity66 at @entity5 on friday , said : ‘ i hardly dare dream			1
@entity20 is in great form and has done well for his break			2
the race ca n’t come quick enough			0
‘ we know he likes soft ground – it is just a shame @entity76 does too but it is going to make it hard for some of the others			0
‘ to even think we are having a runner in with a chance on such a huge day is a huge privilege			0
‘ he has been a real flag bearer since we have decided to use more forcing tactics			0
‘ i ca n’t tell you what it was like that day in @entity89 , it was very special , especially him being @entity34 ’s brother			2
that was one of things i really wanted to achieve and how likely did it seem last year ? ’ @entity3 , with @entity20 after the @entity93 in may , says the horse is in ' great form ' eighteen wins this season , but only six since the start of june , have been landed by @entity3 from a much - reduced string of around 50 horses			1
but she insists she has had no reason to regret the decision to keep her late husband ’s stable going			1
‘ at the beginning , i know it is not a reason to do it , but it was a way of staying close to @entity9 , ’ @entity3 said			1
‘ if it had all had to finish , that would have been more difficult			0
‘ i have n’t got the numbers of some @entity5 trainers but i think we have done well with what we have got – two @entity35 wins , two @entity112 and a @entity114 race			2
‘ i am quite a determined person			0
i think it has gone well			0
you always want more and we all want winners but you ca n’t expect to have them continually			0
i have a lot to look forward to next year			2
’ trainer sir @entity119 has confirmed that a @entity121 meeting at @entity19 on saturday stripped of many of its biggest names will at least have the @entity124 lining up in the @entity125			2
it had been feared soft ground might prevent the 2013 @entity129 winner running but @entity119 said : ‘ we ’ll give it a shot			0
’ @entity129 winner @entity124 , pictured being ridden by @entity132 , will race in the @entity125 @entity134 , the @entity136 - trained 2012 @entity135 winner who became embroiled in the @entity137 involving trainer @entity138 , sustained a fatal hind limb injury while working on tuesday			1
@entity141 jockey @entity140 has died from injuries sustained when the horse she was riding broke its front legs during a training run , throwing her head - first into the track .			0

@entity20 is third favourite for saturday 's @entity46
the @entity3 - trained five - year - old 's big brother @entity34 won it in 2012
@entity3 has no regrets after keeping her late husband sir @entity9 's stables open after his passing with 18 wins this season but six since june
