@entity1 boss @entity0 is not prepared to speculate on when @entity2 might be ready to make his @entity4 debut for the club			1
the striker , one of the stars of the @entity1 ' promotion campaign last season , has been sidelined for eight months by a serious knee injury			1
but he is closing in on full fitness and made a goalscoring return to action this week with @entity1 's under - 21 side			1
@entity0 does not want to speculate on when @entity2 will make his first @entity4 start @entity2 scored 22 goals in the @entity1 ' promotion season last term before suffering a serious knee injury asked if he was hoping @entity2 would be available before @entity20 , @entity0 said : ' no. i 'd be hopeful he 'll be available when he 's ready			1
' he 's been going well , his injury timelines are good			2
and to get him on the grass in a game , albeit a reserve game , is fantastic			2
' he looked nice and healthy and sharp and now it 's about progressing from that , building his physical power and stamina in order to play for longer , and also his mental alignment , to make sure he 's feeling good and he 's feeling right about himself , because that 's a massively important thing			2
' @entity0 admitted the 25 - year - old , who scored 22 goals last season , is desperate to test himself again at top - flight level after making a handful of @entity4 appearances for @entity39 earlier in his career			1
' absolutely , it 's taken him long enough , ' said @entity0			2
@entity0 's side have earned themselves back - to - back wins in the @entity4 after a struggling start ' he 's been out on the grass with us training and each step gives you a boost			1
he slowly edged into training , now he 's been in full training for a couple of weeks so that 's another step forward , and he gets half a reserve game and another step forward			0
' but we 'll build that up slowly			0
there 'll certainly be no rush from our point of view			0
we want to make sure he 's almost over fit			2
' he 's a big character , he 's an important character around the group , let alone his playing ability , so i think the squad are delighted for him as well			0
' the goals of @entity2 and @entity71 were crucial to @entity1 's promotion , and the latter now appears to have found his feet in the @entity4 with three goals in his last four games			1
the 22 - year - old 's brace at @entity78 last weekend helped @entity1 to a second successive win while he also netted twice for @entity80 in their victory over @entity82 at @entity83 earlier this month			1
@entity71 has been impressive for @entity1 so far this season - scoring three goals in his last four appearances @entity71 ' form has led to him being linked with a senior @entity80 call - up , but @entity0 is not expecting that to come any time soon			1
he said : ' it quickly accelerates			0
i suppose the thinking behind that is , with the numbers of @entity95 and world players playing in the @entity4 and not so many home - grown players , then it would be fair to say he is looked at probably more seriously than 20 years ago as a young player			1
' they do get accelerated to certain levels very quickly			0
i know ( @entity80 assistant manager ) @entity102 very well having worked with him at @entity103 and i would think if there was anything in it he 'd probably drop me a line			0
' all players are ambitious , all players want to play at the best level they can , and these players have earned the right to play at this level and beyond possibly			0
' we 'll have to wait and see			0
the main thing for @entity71 is to keep enjoying his football			0
i 've said it all along , he 's at his best when he 's enjoying what he 's doing and he 's certainly enjoying it at the moment			0

@entity1 have secured back - to - back wins in the @entity4
