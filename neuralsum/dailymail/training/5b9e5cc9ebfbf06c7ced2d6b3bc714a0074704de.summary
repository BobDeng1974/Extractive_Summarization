by @entity1 reporter published : 19:49 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 19:49 est , 1 april 2013 new priority : @entity4 councillor @entity3 wants to focus on @entity6 drugs cannabis use in parts of @entity4 is so rife that police should turn a blind eye to it , a local councillor has suggested			1
@entity3 said the drug is ‘ omnipresent ’ in some areas of the historic university city			1
and she wants police to stop targeting cannabis use and focus on more serious drugs			2
she told a meeting of @entity20 last week : ‘ it ’s pretty much impossible to walk more than 100 metres in @entity22 and @entity23 [ areas popular with academics and students ] without smelling it			0
‘ the wards are more or less awash with it			0
' i wonder if it ’s a good use of resources to go after this			1
' it ’s more or less omnipresent			2
’ after the meeting she wrote on @entity36 : ‘ it seems obvious that public opinion on cannabis , at least in my ward , is at odds with the law			0
' resolving the disconnect is a national issue			0
’ she added : ‘ if you want a councillor who thinks the police should ruthlessly target recreational cannabis users , do n’t vote for me			1
’ sgt @entity50 , from @entity51 , told the meeting his officers would challenge anyone spotted with the drug , but said his priority was @entity6 drugs			0
‘ if we get reports in , particularly of dealing , we will deal with that , ’ he added			0
cannabis is a class b drug , but thousands are given a written warning each year for possession			2
wasting time : councillor @entity3 said some parts of @entity4 is so awash with cannabis , going after users may not be the best way to utilise police resources			1

councillor @entity3 says cannabis is ' omnipresent ' in @entity4
@entity78 questioned if *battling* the drug is a ' good use of resources '
