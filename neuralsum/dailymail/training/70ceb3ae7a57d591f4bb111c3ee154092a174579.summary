prince @entity0 showed he is following in the family footsteps as he revealed a bald patch on his royal crown at a tea ceremony in @entity5			1
the 32 - year - old showed an increasing resemblance to his @entity8 while enjoying the lavish refreshments at a renovated tea house in the @entity11 in central @entity5			2
the second - in - line to the throne has been gradually losing his hair for many years , just like his uncle , who began going bald at the age of 21			2
the elder members of the @entity42 deal with their follicular challenges in different ways			0
@entity0 's paternal grandfather , the @entity46 - who began losing his hair at 28 - makes little attempt to disguise his shining pate and @entity49 also favours the honest approach			1
prince @entity51 , however , who began losing his hair at 28 , goes for the ' combover '			2
in contrast , prince @entity54 's bushy ginger mop as yet shows no sign of following the same trend			0
most experts agree that male pattern baldness is passed on by the mother 's side of the family			0
@entity0 's late grandfather @entity63 had a bald patch			1
prince @entity51 , who began losing his hair at 28 , goes for the ' combover ' but scientists have found evidence that in some cases it can also come down from the father 's side			2
the future king has himself previously joked about his receding hairline , telling photographers and reporters after @entity75 was born : ' he 's got more hair than me , thank @entity78			0
' @entity0 was given a rapturous welcome as he was met by flag - waving fans in @entity5 as he marked the start of week - long tour of @entity31 and @entity83 on behalf of the government			1
after a twelve - hour flight and a whirlwind tour of @entity5 in the driving rain , he was treated to full - blown traditional tea ceremony , complete with a delicate plate of cakes			1
joined by @entity5 governor , @entity91 , @entity0 watched as servers prepared the bitter green tea powder before adding water and frothing the mixture using a small wooden whisk			1
the ceremony , which took place in the same tea house used to welcome @entity100 during his visit to the country in 1869 , is a sign of respect			0
@entity0 is at the start of a four - day visit to @entity31 , during which he will travel to @entity108 , the centre of a nuclear meltdown triggered by the 2011 tsunami			1
the first two days , however , are to be spent in the @entity31 capital @entity5 and it was there he landed , arriving at @entity112 in the early hours of the morning			1
@entity113 by mr @entity91 and hundreds of excited fans , @entity0 was ushered into a boat limousine before being whisked across the water to the site of the 2020 @entity118			2
royal visit : @entity100 had his tea ceremony at the same tea house , recently restored , as @entity0 fascinated : @entity0 looked on intently as the history of @entity31 's tea ceremony was explained ritual : the moment was overseen by @entity126 ( left ) , a former grand master of the @entity129 ( ceremony ) beautiful : @entity0 got a brief tour of the spectacular @entity11 gardens historic : the classical gardens once belonged to a shogun , one of the hereditary military governors of @entity31 long day : it was dark by the time the @entity139 left the tea ceremony but still very wet big group : the @entity46 and the governor were trailed by a large group of flunkies piling in : the group did manage to squeeze into the park 's beautifully restored tea house @entity148 : @entity0 was met by a crowd of smartphone - waving fans at @entity5 's haneda airport pleased : the @entity139 looked thrilled with his warm welcome and beamed at the crowd of well - wishers all smiles : before leaving the airport , he treated fans to a smile and a wave the prince , who appeared none the worse for his long flight , smiled and waved at the pursuing press , among them photographers crammed onto a boat travelling close behind			1
after completing the tea ceremony at the @entity11 , he was then shown around the @entity169 style plot , which is filled with sculpted pine trees and blossoming plum trees and once belonged to a shogun [ @entity31 aristocrat ]			1
wooden bridges run over several lakes , where water birds float			0
gardeners have been hard at work for days , clipping the trees and setting up lights , preparing for the visit			0
it was a rare peaceful moment in what looks set to be a busy schedule , with meetings with @entity31 's much - loved @entity186 and @entity187 all on the agenda			0
but the visit is n't without controversy , much of it due to prime minister @entity193 , who , say critics , is ' using ' the royal visit to @entity108 to further his own aims			0
one , @entity198 , a @entity199 priest from the town of @entity201 , two miles from the @entity108 plant , told @entity202 : ' i think @entity193 is using him [ @entity0 ]			1
' it 's true that you can find children playing outside , and you can eat some @entity108 food			0
but to take that as the overall reality here is totally wrong			0
and again ! when the @entity139 arrived at @entity5 's @entity11 , yet more fans were waiting drizzly : despite a torrential downpour , @entity0 spent several minutes meeting well - wishers colourful : with many clutching @entity216 flags and @entity31 @entity217 , the crowd was a colourful sight excited : a pleased - looking @entity0 found himself surrounded by smiling female fans child - friendly : also waiting to welcome the @entity139 was a group of local students still in their school uniform all smiles : prince @entity0 spent several minutes chatting to the youngsters grey day : @entity0 arrived at the @entity5 park on a boat limousine , watched by a cheering crowd thrilled : excited @entity31 fans wait in the rain to see the prince arrive at the @entity11 ' if i could , i would take him to these abandoned ghost towns , and to the temporary houses where people still live , so he could see the reality that we are facing			1
' less controversial is @entity0 's visit to a tv broadcaster , where he will meet actors dressed as samurai and geishas , and his visit to a bookshop where @entity247 cars will be on display			0
along with @entity108 , the 32 - year - old @entity139 will visit other areas devastated by the march 2011 tsunami to show support for the survivors and pay his respects to those who died			1
the tsunami and the earthquake that set it off killed 9,000 people , and displaced tens of thousands , among them those caught in the @entity108 meltdown			2
@entity31 and the @entity261 have enjoyed friendly relations for decades , and , as a result , the @entity31 public is almost as enthusiastic about @entity261 royals as they are about their own			0
@entity0 , who has had a @entity31 following since childhood , is particularly popular thanks to the influence of his mother			2
indeed , so loved was the @entity271 , her visits to @entity31 in 1986 and 1995 sparked what local commentators described as ' @entity274 '			0
crowd control : even the local police could n't resist queuing up for a chat with the prince no stopping : happily , not even heavy downpours could dampen the spirits of royal fans still going : despite having just stepped off the plane , @entity0 was happy to wave at pursuing photographers quick tour : @entity0 's first stop was at the site of the @entity288 , currently under construction pleased : a cheerful @entity0 was accompanied by @entity5 governor , @entity91 ( left ) royal welcome : boats from @entity5 's fire brigade sprayed plumes of coloured water to welcome the prince chilly : at a chilly six degrees @entity297 and with driving rain lashing down , @entity5 proved similar to @entity299 toughing it out : with the help of a pair of umbrella - wielding flunkies , @entity0 and the governor toughed it out =			1
