forget school dinners of lumpy mashed potato , grey mince and mushy carrots			0
the pupils of @entity5 certainly have			1
these days , thanks to a @entity7 in the school kitchen , they enjoy fresh - caught mackerel with beetroot and kale salad , or @entity13 - style fishcakes with pak choi			1
and although meals are five - star quality , they cost a mere £ 2.35			0
that includes pudding , which instead of soggy apple crumble , is more likely to be lemon and rosemary chocolate truffle			0
the school called in @entity7 semi-finalist @entity24 and @entity25 , both formerly of acclaimed @entity28 restaurant @entity26 , after students complained about boring dinners			1
and the pair impressed so much that @entity46 instantly hired them , and now the children are tucking into the likes of smoked mackerel , kale and ciabatta - for just £ 2.35 a day			1
' the kids do n't trust some of the things we put on the plates , but most of the time they end up loving it , ' said mr @entity24 , who is now cooking up to 500 school meals a day			1
amuse bouche : the chefs offer taster sessions of the food before serving the meals to the whole school ' i 've got plans to deliver some ambitious dishes in the future - we want to start them on macaroons soon			2
' a typical school lunch is now something most of us would be very happy to find on our plates while out at a fancy restaurant			0
an example of what the children might find on their plates on an average day is smoked mackerel , which is caught on the day , with beetroot and kale salad , and a lemon and rosemary chocolate truffle for dessert			2
new fad : kale chips have become a huge hit at @entity91 after the chefs introduced them to the menu fine fish : smoked makerel is among the dishes the children can eat for just £ 2.35 a day for a full meal all the rave : a beetroot and kale salad which the @entity5 pupils say they love time for pudding : @entity106 and rosemary chocolate truffles and chocolate mousses - topped with cream or if that does n't pique their interest , the chefs are happy to whip up a chocolate mousse with caramelised biscuits and cream as a treat			1
the only problem now is that parents are having to contend with the chefs ' high standards when cooking for their children at home			1
one mother said : ' my son used to complain that the food was boring			0
now he comes home talking saying he will only he eat his salad with extra virgin olive oil			0
gone are the days of sausage and mash			0
' these are the best school meals in @entity35			0
the only problem is my son comes home and now he turns his nose up at beans on toast			0
' used to the best : the pupils are now going home expecting top food from their parents too @entity141 salad ( or as they call it , ' that grass stuff ' ) and ciabatta ( ' posh bread ' ) , are the latest culinary crazes at @entity5			1
mr @entity25 said : ' it 's a bit hit and miss. but most of the dishes they love			2
some of the culinary delights available to @entity5 pupils include : ' every week we do small little testers to see their reaction			2
so last week we let them try some kale , and now they ca n't get enough of it			0
' the chefs ' decision to leave their restaurant jobs and move into cooking at school is largely down to the hours - and the opportunity to get their lives back			2
this is especially important for mr @entity24 , whose first child is due in november			0
mr @entity46 says he now has plans to ditch the plastic chairs and trays and transform the canteen into a restaurant - complete with ' special of the day ' hoardings at the entrance			1
he added that the canteen 's takings have soared since mr @entity24 and mr @entity25 got into the kitchen , and staff are now vying for seats at the dining room tables alongside their pupils			1
turnover has increased by 21 per cent , while 72 per cent of pupils are now having school lunches - up from 60 per cent last year			0
' it 's just given the whole school a lift , and it 's been fantastic for our pupils from deprived backgrounds , ' mr @entity46 said .			1
