by @entity0 in the days and weeks since early may when his elderly parents were killed , @entity1 has been as puzzled as anyone else			1
@entity4 and @entity5 had been married 62 years			1
both in their late 80s , they fell prey to unspeakable violence in georgia - savagery as the @entity10 sheriff has called it -- and whoever inflicted it seems to have left nary a trace			2
' it just eats at you that somebody could do this and possibly get away with it			0
... we do n't even know the motive at this point , ' their son @entity1 said by phone on wednesday			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , both in their late 80s , were found brutally murdered in their @entity27 lake side home in may			1
mr @entity1 had been decapitated			1
their killer has not been found ' it 's very hard to catch somebody when you do n't even know their motive , and you do n't know whether they would do it again			1
' @entity1 , 55 , who lives in north @entity38 , said his family is still sorting through his parents ' belongings			1
' it 's really tough , ' he said			2
as the investigation into the couple 's death reached its three - month mark , sheriff @entity43 said the case still weighs on him			1
@entity43 said he rose at 4am the other day to make note of an investigative angle that came to him in the night			0
' myself and one detective continue to work on this every day , ' the sheriff said			0
investigators this week polygraphed someone who came forward with information that could prove fruitful , ' to see if they were truthful , ' @entity43 said			0
on the sheriff 's desk on wednesday were 4,000 - plus pages of documents related to the @entity65 couple 's finances			1
@entity66 , 88 , had retired from corporate life -- much of it with clockmaking companies -- in the late 1980s to run a chain of @entity73 - area @entity72 's restaurants			1
about 15 years ago , he and his wife , @entity74 , 87 , moved to @entity75 to live out their years in a golf - course community in a waterfront home			1
sometime during the first weekend in may , they were killed			0
neighbors concerned they had n't seen him found his body on may 6 in the garage of the @entity1 's @entity85 residence			1
the 3,200 - square - foot , $ 1 million home sits in a tree - shrouded @entity87 in the @entity90 subdivision , a dozen or so miles northeast of @entity91			1
@entity5 's body did n't turn up until may 16			1
@entity93 found it in the lake , about five miles away by water			1
autopsies showed that she and her husband died of head wounds , but exactly how they were killed is anyone 's guess			1
@entity66 's decapitated body was found at the couple 's $ 1million lake - front home on may 6 one theory investigators are working on is that the killers reached the @entity109 ' @entity27 home via the 19,000 - acre lake the @entity111 and some @entity27 sheriff 's investigators have helped in the probe , poring over the case file			1
@entity43 recently called on the expertise of two detectives from the @entity118 , @entity38 , sheriff 's office 's cold - case squad			2
@entity43 roomed with @entity118 sheriff @entity121 when the two attended the @entity123			0
the @entity38 detectives spent a day and a half in @entity91 examining crime - scene photographs and other materials , @entity43 said			2
from the beginning of the investigation , authorities acknowledged that cracking the case might prove difficult			2
no one reported hearing any commotion			0
the @entity134 likely were dead three days before @entity66 's body was found			1
video cameras at the guard house at the entrance to the subdivision were n't working			1
and it is possible the killer came by boat			2
the 19,000 - acre lake offered countless entry and escape routes			2
while investigators for days scoured the @entity65 house and areas around it for evidence , whatever they collected has yet to render a linchpin clue			2
and in the months since the killings , despite $ 55,000 in reward money , the flow of tips has all but dried up			0
friends went to check on the elderly couple 's home in may because they had failed to turn up for a @entity159 party even the kooks have quit calling			1
' reluctantly , or regretfully i guess is the better word , ' @entity43 said , ' i have to admit that things have slowed considerably			0
we are not getting any new calls			0
the reward is not seeming to initiate any information			0
... we 're not even getting the psychics			0
' @entity1 said he and his family -- the elder @entity109 had two other children , a younger son and daughter -- appreciate the locals who contributed to the reward fund			2
' it shows how much they were loved around the community , ' he said			0
' we 're just hoping that maybe that 'll trigger something ... that somebody will come forward and spill the beans			0
' on wednesday , he was unaware of any imminent developments in the case			0
' not that we 're losing hope , but it gets tougher and tougher to believe that something 's gon na happen here , ' he said			0
' i would n't say it 's a cold case , but it 's not looking too optimistic at this point			0
i 'm sure the police and whatnot ... it 's just driving them crazy			0
' @entity1 said he is confident @entity43 and other investigators are up to the task			2
' we 've heard from people around in the area that he certainly is somebody that is tenacious and wo n't give up			0
we 're hoping that 's true , ' he said			0
' it 's a very infamous case at this point so , yeah , i 'm sure as far as his own reputation and everything else , they 're doing everything they can to get it done			0
' he added that crime shows on television , the ' csi ' types , make the unsolved killing of his mother and father all the more frustrating			0
' the techniques they have of uncovering evidence and stuff like that , ' @entity1 said , ' it 's almost hard to believe that somebody could be that good a criminal that they did n't leave behind anything			1
