businessman @entity12 , now 65 , used the £ 8,500 from the sale of his treasured sports car to launch his business , which is now worth millions			1

reunited : @entity17 ( left ) flew to the @entity21 to track down the @entity4 that his friend @entity12 ( centre ) sold 25 years ago to fund their new business			2
after finding the car in @entity27 , with the help of mr @entity12 's nephew @entity29 , he was able to return the beloved motor vehicle mr @entity17 flew from his home in @entity32 to @entity21 , putting his amateur sleuthing skills to the test and within a week found the car in @entity27 , where it had been sold by mr @entity12 in the 1980s			1
after buying the car , mr @entity17 then had the car driven to @entity39 , west @entity40 , where mr @entity12 was celebrating his 65th birthday at home with his family			1
during the party mr @entity17 took him outside where the gleaming @entity4 was sitting in the drive			2
' it was just one of those amazing moments - i could see a @entity4 and thought one of my family had arrived in it , ' said mr @entity12			2
' then i thought : " it looks a bit like my old one " - but even then i did n't realise what was going on			0
pride and joy : @entity12 washing the @entity4 back in 1986 , before he sold it for £ 8,500 to launch his business ' but i saw the registration number and realised it was my old car			1
' i could n't believe it when @entity17 handed me the keys - the last time i saw it was over 25 years ago			2
' @entity17 had bought the car in @entity27 and my nephew @entity29 drove it down to @entity40 for my 65th birthday			2
i was completely bowled over			0
' engineer mr @entity12 met mr @entity17 when they worked together in @entity67 , using poorly designed scanning equipment to test for cracks in gas storage tanks			1
in mr @entity17 's native @entity32 the two friends designed a better machine to carry out the work but did n't have the cash to put it into production			2
father - of - one mr @entity12 , who moved back to the @entity21 on his retirement , said : ' @entity17 had four young children so it was a struggle for him and i did n't have any capital			1
' but i did have the @entity4 back home in @entity40 so i reluctantly decided to sell it			0
' we used the cash from the car to build our first scanning machine and we never looked back from there			0
' the successful @entity88 - based company , @entity87 , is now one of the world ’s leading manufacturers of magnetic flux leakage tank floor scanners and is worth millions of pounds , selling inspection tools for storage tanks and pipelines across the world			1
wrench : mr @entity12 reluctantly decided to sell his car , despite it being his pride and joy capital : the pair used the money from the sale of the car to build their first scanning machine			1
their company , @entity108 , is now worth millions of pounds the three - litre @entity18 , first made in 1978 , is a design classic and mr @entity12 's was in the colours of the @entity111			1
mr @entity12 said : ' it was my pride and joy , i 'd always wanted one but i had to do the sensible thing and sell it			2
' it got our business off the ground and we were very successful			0
' i was lucky enough to have a couple of porsches while i was living in the @entity123			0
' but i often wondered what happened to my first one - it was a bit special			0
' gift : mr @entity12 is thrilled to have been reunited with his car working order : the @entity4 's engine on the road : mr @entity12 with his precious @entity4 mr @entity12 sold his half of @entity87 last year to mr @entity17 , whose four children now work in the family firm based in @entity135 , @entity32			1
when mr @entity12 turned 65 , mr @entity17 flew over , and with a little help from mr @entity12 's wife @entity137 , managed to track the car down			1
mr @entity12 said : ' apparently the owner did n't want to sell - he 'd spent a lot of money on the car bringing it up to tip top condition			1
' but @entity17 made him an offer he could n't refuse			0
' i think he felt he owed me for the sacrifice i had made 30 years ago and the @entity4 was payback			0
' but i never saw it that way - he 's like a brother to me			0
' good as new : inside the sports car , which was found in @entity27 and then driven to mr @entity12 's home in @entity39 branding : the last owner had spent hundreds of pounds bringing the car back up to tip top condition mr @entity17 , who was back in @entity32 today , said : ' it took a while but with the help of @entity12 's wife @entity137 and his nephew @entity29 we found the @entity4 after all those years			1
' the problem was that the owner was in love with it , he had spent a lot of money on the car and did n't want to sell			0
' but i sent him an email explaining the history of the car and what it meant to @entity12			2
' i must have touched a nerve because he emailed me back saying he was really moved by the story and he did n't feel as if the car was his any more			0
so we did a deal			0
' giving it back to @entity12 was one of the best feelings in my life - and he was gobsmacked as you say over there			0
' in fact he actually sobbed and he 's not an emotional guy			0
' but it was my way of saying thank you for everything he did for me and my family - he is the nicest guy i 've ever met			0
