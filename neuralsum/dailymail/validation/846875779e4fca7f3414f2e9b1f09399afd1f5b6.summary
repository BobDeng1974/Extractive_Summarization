@entity0 is so determined to maintain his positive start to the tennis season that he is shelving any plans for a honeymoon until the end of the year in november			1
and the world no 4 , who is marrying @entity8 on april 11 in @entity9 , has not entirely ruled out playing in the @entity10 in the week immediately afterwards			1
he thinks that unlikely , but as one of the most momentous days in his eventful life looms he is adamant that he can compartmentalise such questions and focus on the @entity14 , his last tournament as a single man			1
@entity0 practices in @entity16 ahead of his opening match at the @entity14 this week @entity0 takes time out to sign autographs for supporters in @entity16 on the second day of the @entity14 the world no 4 poses with fans at the @entity22 @entity0 happily signed autographs ahead of his opening match against either @entity24 or @entity25 after reaching the semi-final in @entity27 last week @entity0 is now the second highest points scorer on the @entity29 this year , albeit some way behind the dominant @entity31			1
he now arrives at the event hosted by the city he considers a second home – where plays either @entity24 or @entity25 – and is not finding it hard to separate the two biggest things in his life , happy to discuss the forthcoming nuptials with @entity8 when relaxing at his downtown apartment			2
' @entity41 is important but we also have lives to live as well , ' he said on tuesday			0
' when i 'm on the court i 'm not thinking " i 'm getting married in a few weeks " but back at the apartment there 's time to do that			2
i can concentrate on both			0
' as long as it 's not in the forefront of my mind when i 'm training then it 's fine			2
it has n't been a problem for me yet and i do n't see it as an issue			2
' whatever happens at this tournament the 27 year - old @entity56 will not rush back across the @entity58 : ' hopefully it wo n't finish for me here until a week on sunday and then i 'll go home after that , ' said @entity0 , who is having not just one but three best men : brother @entity63 , former @entity65 player @entity64 and an old friend from @entity67 , @entity68			1
@entity0 said he is shelving plans for a honeymoon after marrying @entity8 in april until later this year the 27 - year - old , who has started the year in good form , waits to speak to members of the media on tuesday @entity0 says he is coping fine juggling his tennis and planning a wedding @entity0 is marrying long - term partner @entity78 in his hometown @entity9 on april 11 ' if i do n't do well i 'm going to stay here anyway and train on the clay and get used to playing in hot conditions			1
regardless of how i do i 'll be here for the next ten days			0
' with his 28th birthday looming time is short and @entity0 's first few weeks as a married man will involve getting stuck into the clay with little luxuriating in his new status			1
he will play in @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 before the @entity93 , and might even take his new bride straight to the @entity95			0
' depending on how i feel after the wedding there 's potential to play @entity10 , but i 'd say that 's unlikely			1
the honeymoon wo n't be until the end of the year			1
' it was this time last year that he split from @entity104 in a tumultuous week when he cut a distraught figure , and he now feels far more settled with the @entity108 's replacement @entity106			2
' my mind is a lot clearer and i think that 's shown , ' he said			0
' last year i came here and had struggled for the first three months and physically i was still not feeling great after surgery			0
i had n't seen @entity104 much , probably for only three to four weeks since my surgery ( in late september ) and there was n't much direction			0
that carried on for a bit after i finished here			0
' i was disappointed with how i played against @entity31 on saturday but otherwise i felt i played well at @entity27			1
i had n't played well there for about five years and this was by far the best in that time			0
' @entity122 no 1 @entity0 crashed out of the @entity124 semi-final at @entity27 after losing to @entity31 @entity0 will be hoping to go one step further in @entity126 , a tournament he has won twice before in 2009 and 2013 @entity0 's caoch @entity106 watches on from the stands in @entity27 a look at the ' @entity131 ' confirms this has been a decent start to the year for @entity0 , with him ahead of @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , in that order			1
the perception that he has stuttered might have been inflated by the loss to the imperious @entity31			2
the world no 4 took one of his near three million followers on @entity143 to task on monday for questioning his methods in a curiously long exchange – you never know what you are going to get from @entity0 on social media , but at least he does not leave his account to others for mere @entity153 puffs			1
in the hot mid-day sun on tuesday he went well beyond the call of duty doing pictures and autographs , having also discussed his hiring of @entity159 as assistant coach			0
the @entity161 can not join him until he is knocked out of his country 's version of @entity164			0
' we spoke on the phone for two and a half hours , ' @entity0 revealed			2
' the time went very quickly			0
he has also spoken to @entity106 on the phone and apparently they also got along very well			0
