by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 06:00 est , 27 december 2012 mystery : codebreaker @entity2 was found dead in his @entity4 flat in august 2010 the @entity6 codebreaker who was found dead inside a holdall probably locked himself inside the bag , according to police			1
an inquest into the death of @entity2 found that he could have been the victim of foul play , as the coroner expressed doubts that he could have locked the bag himself			1
however , @entity17 detectives investigating the case discovered that it is possible to lock the type of holdall he was found in from the inside , and now say it is likely that no one else was involved in mr @entity2 ' death			1
the body of the codebreaker , who was on secondment to @entity6 from @entity31 , was discovered in a bathtub in his flat in @entity34 , central @entity4 , in august 2010			1
coroner @entity35 ruled earlier this year that it was unlikely mr @entity2 could have locked himself into the red @entity38 holdall which contained his body and whose keys were also locked inside the bag			1
experts testified that they had tried to lock themselves inside the bag more than 400 times , and said even famed escapologist @entity45 would have had difficulty doing so			0
but just a few days after dr @entity35 delivered her verdict , a retired sergeant revealed that the feat was in fact possible , casting doubt on the assertion that someone else must have been involved in mr @entity2 ' death			1
police refined the experiment to mirror the exact way the bag had been locked - and agreed that mr @entity2 could have secured the holdall himself , according to the @entity59			2
in addition , detectives do not believe there is any evidence of forced entry which could suggest that the codebreaker was murdered			0
locked : mr @entity2 ' body was found inside a red @entity38 holdall similar to this one ' they have been unable to find any trace of anyone who should not have been in the flat and every reason to believe that @entity2 may have climbed into the bag himself and been unable to get out , ' an inquiry source told the @entity59			1
police are now apparently planning to inform the coroner of their belief that mr @entity2 died alone			2
dr @entity35 initially dismissed the idea that the spy could have been the victim of ' auto - erotic activity ' - but detectives say there is no other plausible explanation for his death			0
the mysterious circumstances surrounding mr @entity2 ' death sparked speculation that he could have been assassinated by the security services			0
his @entity6 colleagues did not report him missing for a week , and failed to hand over key evidence from their office , which raised the possibility that they could have been involved in a cover - up			0
investigation : police have denied that foul play was responsible for the codebreaker 's death however , others pointed to an apparent interest in bondage and cross-dressing as a more likely explanation for his death			0
mr @entity2 was once found by his landlord tied to his own bed wearing only underwear , while he apparently kept Â£ 20,000 worth of women 's clothes in his flat			2
a spokesman for the @entity111 declined to confirm the detectives ' latest findings , saying : ' this remains an active investigation and officers continue to explore a number of lines of inquiry			0
' officers retain an open mind in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death of mr @entity2			0
