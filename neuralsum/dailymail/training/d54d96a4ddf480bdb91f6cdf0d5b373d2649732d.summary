@entity1 manager @entity0 has no concerns about @entity4 's ability to handle the physical and mental pressure of being the team 's attacking focal point			1
with striker @entity9 still at least a fortnight away from returning from a thigh injury , @entity4 has occupied the centre - forward role in the last five matches			1
on monday he became embroiled in a spat with @entity15 's @entity14 , which resulted in both players slapping each other around the head			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity4 ( left ) clashed with @entity15 's @entity14 on monday night @entity1 boss @entity0 , at training on tuesday , has been impressed with @entity4 's temperament the pair escaped punishment on the night and also any retrospective action , and @entity0 is confident the 20 - year - old can handle the unwanted attention which comes with being the side 's main striker			1
' i 've been so impressed with his ability to deal with pressure , ' said the @entity33 boss			1
' it was an unfortunate incident and the referee called it right			0
they had been niggling at each other all game but it was nothing			0
' @entity14 is a good player and he gave him ( @entity4 ) a hard time - i do n't think he 's had that in his time			1
' i have no qualms about him dealing with those moments			0
he has dealt with pressure since he broke into the team aged 17			2
@entity4 ( right ) has been deployed as a central striker in @entity9 's absence for the @entity33 ' there will be moments in the game when the red mist may come across and of course every player has to handle that			1
' he is so strong physically , he surprises a lot of people with his body strength , so he can make defenders look silly not just with his pace			0
' he accepts it ( physical confrontation ) is part of the game and teams may want to do that , but it is important you retain that self - control and concentrate on your performance			2
' since missing a number of chances at @entity76 in his first match in the position , the youngster has begun to get to grips with what the role entails			0
he got two against @entity82 in the @entity83 and scored the only goal of the match at @entity86 on @entity87 with a carbon copy of a chance he missed at @entity91 , and his stint as a centre - forward is not attracting as nearly as much criticism as it did a fortnight ago			2
@entity4 will not face any action after pushing @entity14 in the face ' the thing that impressed me with @entity4 is his tactical idea of the game , ' added @entity0			1
' we set the team up to press and that was one of the key things for putting him in the team			0
' he can play anywhere along that front line and that is the type of player i like			0
' there is no doubt you need to have a player in there who scores goals but you can see that in him that he has the ability to do that			0
' captain @entity120 will return to the starting line - up to face struggling @entity122 at @entity123 on @entity124			1
@entity0 talks to his backroom staff during the training session at @entity127 in @entity1 on tuesday the midfielder is in the final six months of his contract and effectively could open negotiations with a foreign club now , but @entity0 remains relaxed about the situation			2
' i think he has earned that respect if he does , ' the @entity133 said			0
' i have a great relationship and communication with @entity120 so we understand exactly the position			0
' @entity0 does not expect to do much business in the transfer window , preferring to try to improve the many players he signed in the summer , but has not ruled out recalling 19 - year - old @entity143 from an impressive loan spell at high - flying @entity146 side @entity145			1
' i have seen a lot of @entity143 's games and he has been outstanding but that is the reason why we sent him out - to get game experience , ' said @entity0			2
' we need just to decide whether it is the right thing to bring him back or continue his great development at @entity145			0
' @entity0 looks on during the cold training session at @entity127 as he gets his @entity1 side ready			2
