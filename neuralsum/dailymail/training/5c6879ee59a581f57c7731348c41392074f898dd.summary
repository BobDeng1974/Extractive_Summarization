by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:06 est , 5 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:37 est , 5 december 2013 saving : chancellor @entity4 said he was taking action to curb rises in the cost of motoring and catching the train fuel duty will not rise before the general election and an inflation - busting rail fare rise has been scrapped in a bid to cut the cost of getting to work			1
@entity4 found £ 750million to cancel a 2p - a - litre rise in fuel due next september			1
and rail fares will rise at 3.1 per cent in the @entity19 in line with inflation , instead of the 4.1 per cenr commuters were told to prepare for			2
mr @entity4 said he wanted to help struggling families in a meaningful way by reducing scrapping all of the rises which the last government had planned over several years			1
mr @entity4 told @entity29 : ‘ next year ’s fuel duty rise will be cancelled			1
instead of petrol taxes going up by 2 pence a litre , they will stay frozen			1
‘ that means compared to the previous government ’s plans , petrol will be 20 pence a litre less			2
that ’s £ 11 less every time you fill up			0
a saving for drivers over this @entity42 of £ 680			0
’ he went on : ‘ we ’re helping those who drive a car and we ’re helping those who get the train too			0
‘ for fares next january were due to go up by 1 per cent above inflation			0
‘ we are going to keep average fares flat in real terms			0
’ the fuel duty freeze is one of the key measures mr @entity4 unveiled to counter @entity56 ’s challenge that the coalition is failing to act on the cost of living crisis			1
in addition to scrapping the rise planned for september 2014 , the chancellor also ruled out any further rises before may 2015			1
mr @entity4 will then have frozen duty for four years in total , at a cost to the @entity66 of £ 22billion			1
in the last decade the cost of petrol at the pump has risen from 74.6p to 130.25p			2
under @entity56 fuel duty rose from 45.82p per litre in june 2003 to 57.19p by the time of the 2010 election			1
two thirds of the cost of petrol is made up of tax , either fuel duty or vat			1
tax accounts for more of the cost of petrol than in any other @entity90 country			2
mr @entity4 signalled his plan to freeze fuel duty at the @entity93 party conference in october , but at the time had not found the money to pay for it			1
three in five drivers have cut back on car use because of rising costs , according to the @entity99			2
a @entity101 survey for the @entity99 showed 45 per cent of people are using their car less and 28 per cent are slashing family or personal budgets to compensate			0
in @entity107 , 67 per cent of people are spending less or driving less because of fuel costs			2
almost half of motorists have cut back on spending or driving as a result of high fuel costs , according to an @entity99 survey the @entity99 argued that the economic recovery was not being felt by struggling motorists , even at a time when supermarkets are embroiled in a petrol price war			1
ahead of the @entity121 , @entity99 president @entity120 said : ‘ the government has committed to a fuel duty freeze and is trying to extend the 5p rural fuel duty rebate , which is helpful			1
‘ however , if the @entity66 is going to make concessions to the fuel retail industry , it needs to tie them to fairer pricing			0
‘ that can be achieved via wholesale price transparency			0
despite falls in the average price , inflated prices on some forecourts mean lower sales hence fewer customers			0
’ costs : rail fares will rise by 3.1 per cent in line with inflation , instead of 4.1 per cent , saving passengers £ 25 a year on average the january 2014 fare rise for regulated rail fares , which include season tickets , was to have averaged 4.1 per cent			0
but mr @entity4 said today that the rise would be limited to an average of 3.1 per cent			0
mr @entity4 announced that his decision would benefit more than 250,000 annual season ticket holders who will , on average in 2014 , save £ 25			0
for instance , an annual season ticket from @entity153 to @entity154 should be around £ 35 less in 2014 than it would have been without the change in the price formula , while an annual season ticket from @entity159 to @entity154 should be around £ 45 less			0
however , as announced earlier , train companies will still be allowed to put some regulated fares up by a limit of 2 per cent above the @entity164 cap ( in other words by as much as 5.1 per cent ) as long as the average rise is no more than 3.1 per cent .			0

coalition has scrapped or frozen every *scheduled* fuel duty rise since 2010
motoring *groups* say only a price cut would satisfy hard - pressed @entity173
petrol will be *20p* *cheaper* than if @entity56 *'s* planned rises had gone ahead
