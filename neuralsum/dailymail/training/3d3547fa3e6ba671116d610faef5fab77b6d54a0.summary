by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 03:57 est , 4 may 2012 it was a gloomy day at @entity2 today when @entity3 accompanied @entity4 to the polling stations where they were to vote in the @entity8 election			1
but the prime minister 's wife made sure to cut a swathe through the grey as she stepped out in a pair of bright orange trousers			2
she paired the tapered style , a pair of £ 39.99 cigarette pants from @entity18 , with an ivory blouse , grey round - necked jumper from high street store @entity22 and a pair of grey suede @entity25 heels			1
@entity3 debuted the vibrant cigarette pants back in october , when she paired them with a grey v - neck sweater from @entity18 , and the same grey @entity25 pumps she wore today			1
the look is a tried - and - tested one for the @entity10 's wife , and one that skilfully treads that delicate line between adventurous and sensible			0
the sobering effect of the schoolgirl grey sweater acts as the perfect foil for the tropical tone of her bottom half , and the grey shoes pull the look together neatly			0
slim silhouette : cigarette pants are a flattering cut , elongating and slimming the legs , though they are unforgiving on the bottom , so best suit someone with a slender figure like @entity3 's it is an outfit that says ' i 'm fashionable , quirky , contemporary - but dependable and approachable '			1
the juicy tangerine toned trousers are a welcome break from the norm , given that @entity3 , while frequently fashion - forward , more often than not favours her trusty black @entity79 cigarette pants for public events			1
but where her tailoring is sober , elsewhere , @entity3 is no stranger to colour in her wardrobe			2
she may favour simplicity on so many occasions , but she is equally at home in bright pink @entity87 , for example , or jade green @entity89			0
a confident dresser , she is never afraid to experiment with her style , and manages to mix high fashion , high - end pieces into her more sober ' political wife ' wardrobe with aplomb			0
playing it safe : accompanying her @entity100 to the polling station , @entity99 wore an unadventurous look of jeans , navy blazer and brown boots indeed , one political wife who could take a leaf out of @entity3 's book is @entity99 , who accompanied her @entity100 husband @entity100 to the polling station today			1
wearing baggy jeans and an uninspiring navy blazer , she failed to set @entity2 alight			0
as for @entity115 's wife @entity114 , whose style leans towards the flamboyant , she was nowhere to be seen			0
a clear win for @entity3 , whatever the outcome at the polling booths .			2

@entity3 also wore the £ 39.99 trousers last year at the @entity40
