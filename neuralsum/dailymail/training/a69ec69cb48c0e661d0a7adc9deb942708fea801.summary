by @entity0 a hospital has sparked outrage after banning overweight patients from using beds on an emergency ward			1
those weighing over 15 stone are not permitted to use the beds at @entity8 in @entity9 , north east @entity10 , after fire experts insisted the evacuation system was a danger for overweight patients			1
campaigners have slammed the restriction as ' completely unacceptable ' and denying patients their rights - but the hospital has insisted it must remain			1
the ban has been imposed by @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , after fire experts insisted the evacuation system was a danger for overweight patients hospital bosses imposed the order after meeting with @entity25			1
@entity26 , chairperson of @entity10 @entity27 said : ' i 've never heard anything like this before and it is totally unacceptable			1
' the ban is actually against the patients ' human rights and civil liberties and they can quite easily launch legal action if it means their treatment is hampered			1
' the section affected is the former ward 10 , which was closed last year for refurbishment but has re-opened as an @entity40			1
ms @entity26 added : ' i understand the fire brigade 's danger assessment , but i feel the hospital should have had a plan that catered for patients of all shapes and sizes before doing this work			1
' we 've known for a long time that many people are overweight , that 's not happened overnight , so the hospital should be clever enough to cater for everyone in all areas			1
' i would n't even say 15 stone is a particularly obese weight , and therefore i would worry for the safety of all patients , regardless of their size			2
' surely a 15 stone person would n't be a hazard ? i 'd like to hear how they came up with the weight ban			0
' campaigners have slammed the restriction as ' completely unacceptable ' and denying overweight patients their rights the news comes just a week after a senior nurse at dr @entity71 's spoke out about suspected stroke victims and patients with heart problems passing out in chairs because of a severe shortage of beds			1
the affected ward , which had 15 beds , closed in august last year after it was deemed unsuitable for modern health care needs			2
but the area has been reopened after @entity82 admitted it has been tough to find beds for everyone since			0
an @entity82 spokeswoman defended the restrictions on people weighing over 15 stone			0
she said : ' the former ward 10 at dr @entity71 's is currently the temporary home of the @entity40 and the @entity90			2
" when the reconfiguration work at the hospital is complete , these services will move out of this area and into refurbished accommodation			0
' the reconfiguration project is aimed at moving - once and for all - all in - patient accommodation out of the oldest parts of the building , which are no longer in line with modern health care needs			0
' however , to allow this project to go ahead , we need to use the former ward 10 , on a temporary basis , as a turning space			2
' there is no other suitable accommodation available at dr @entity71 's			0
we worked very closely with @entity25 prior to this move , staging a worst case scenario simulated evacuation			2
' this was observed throughout by @entity25			0
they asked us to introduce a 15 stone limit on patients and we agreed			2
' once the reconfiguration work is complete , the former ward 10 and associated areas will be used for a range of day case work , including chemotherapy			0
' this work represents a Â£ 3million investment in dr @entity71 's by @entity82 and will result in a vastly improved environment for patients and staff			0
' as has been acknowledged , the hospital is very busy at the moment			0
we are incredibly grateful for the hard work of our staff and the understanding of our patients			0
