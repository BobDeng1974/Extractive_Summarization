by @entity1 reporter published : 14:10 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 17:54 est , 12 may 2013 astronauts making a rare , hastily planned spacewalk replaced a pump outside the @entity5 this weekend in the hopes of plugging a serious ammonia leak			1
the prospects of success grew as the minutes , then hours passed and no frozen flecks of ammonia appeared			1
@entity12 said it appeared as though the leak may have been plugged , although additional monitoring over the coming weeks will be needed before declaring a victory			1
' i will tell you that we 're happy			1
we 're very happy , ' said @entity19 , @entity20 's deputy space station program manager			1
the spacewalk outside the @entity5 was captured on film by the tweeting , @entity24 , social media maven and space station commander @entity26			1
' amazing day , ' he said			0
' @entity28 ( extra-vehicular activity ) went off without a hitch			0
great crew , phenomenal ground support and a supportive audience			0
who could ask for anything more ? ' space : @entity37 and @entity38 work outside the @entity5 in the ' approaching orbital sunset , the harshest of light , a blackness like endless velvet , ' said @entity26 illuminating : @entity37 and @entity38 turn on their helmet lights ' doing their best to light the universe on the dark side of the @entity47 , ' said @entity26 one small step : ' climbing out of the airlock , quite the commute to work ! ' said @entity26 via @entity51 @entity37 , @entity52 and lead spacewalker on saturday say cheese : @entity37 and @entity38 take a minute with visors open to have their picture taken by @entity26 , inside the @entity5 dr. @entity38 , well - dressed for a day 's work outdoors ' we did n't see any obvious signs of a leak , but it 's going to take some time ... for us to look at the system , evaluate the system and make sure we did , indeed , stop the leak			1
' @entity19 expects it will take ' a good four weeks , five weeks , maybe even a few weeks longer			1
' ' obviously , the longer you go , the more confidence you get , ' he told reporters			0
@entity37 and @entity38 installed the new pump after removing the old one suspected of spewing flakes of frozen ammonia coolant two days earlier			1
they uncovered ' no smoking guns ' responsible for the leak and consequently kept a sharp lookout for any icy flecks that might appear from the massive frame that holds the solar panels on the left side			2
spacewalk : astronaut @entity37 took photos as he worked on repairs to the @entity5 on may 11 , 2013			2
@entity37 and crewmate @entity38 are believed to have repaired the dangerous ammonia leak concern : @entity20 emphasized that the lives of the multinational crew were not in danger but both @entity89 and @entity91 space experts were scrambling to swiftly fix the problem emergency : this picture shows the astronauts being prepared for their spacewalk at the @entity5 ammonia : astronauts discovered a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system ' let us know if you see anything , ' @entity12 urged as the fresh pump was cranked up			1
thirty minutes later , all was still well			0
' no snow , ' the astronauts radioed			2
' we have our eyes on it and have n't seen a thing , ' @entity38 said			0
@entity20 said the leak , while significant , never jeopardized crew safety			1
the space agency never before staged such a fast , impromptu spacewalk for a station crew			2
even during the shuttle program , unplanned spacewalks were uncommon			0
the ammonia pump was the chief suspect going into saturday 's spacewalk			1
so it was disheartening for @entity20 , at first , as @entity37 and @entity38 reported nothing amiss on or around the old pump			1
' all the pipes look shiny clean , no crud , ' @entity37 said as he used a long , dentist - like mirror to peer into tight , deep openings			0
' i ca n't give you any good data other than nominal , unfortunately			0
' engineers determined there was nothing to lose by installing a new pump , despite the lack of visible damage to the old one			0
the entire team - weary and stressed by the frantic pace of the past two days - gained more and more confidence as the 5 1/2 - hour spacewalk drew to a close with no flecks of ammonia popping up			1
' @entity148 fingers crossed , ' space station commander @entity26 said in a tweet from inside			0
' no leaks ! ' he wrote a half - hour later			0
space station commander @entity26 of @entity153 has tweeted that the problem , while serious , has been stabilized crew noticed white flakes of ammonia leaking out of the station on thursday flight controllers in @entity160 worked furiously to get ready for saturday 's operation , completing all the required preparation in under 48 hours			1
the astronauts trained for just such an emergency scenario before they rocketed into orbit			2
this area on the space station is prone to leaks			0
the ammonia coursing through the plumbing is used to cool the space station 's electronic equipment			2
there are eight of these power channels , and all seven others were operating normally			2
' we may not have found exactly the smoking gun , ' @entity37 said , ' but to pull off what this team did yesterday and today , working practically 48 straight hours , it was a remarkable effort on everybody 's behalf			1
' @entity20 officials remain mystified as to why the leak erupted			1
@entity186 already had been seeping ever so slightly from the location , but the flow increased dramatically thursday			0
@entity19 did not know , as of saturday evening , how much ammonia was lost			2
another spacewalk will be needed to replenish the supply			2
with the repair work behind them , the astronauts and ground controllers turned their attention to the impending departure of three of the six crewmen			1
@entity38 has been on the space station since december and is set to return to @entity47 late monday , along with @entity26 , a @entity153 , and @entity89 @entity200			0
@entity37 is a new arrival , on board for just 1 1/2 months			0
by coincidence , the two @entity91 performed a spacewalk at this troublesome spot before , during a shuttle visit in 2009			0
' this type of event is what the years of training were for , ' @entity26 said in a tweet friday			0
' a happy , busy crew , working hard , loving life in space			0

astronauts made the spacewalk to fix a coolant leak today
ammonia coolant was leaking from the power system on board the @entity223
@entity20 will monitor the situation in the coming weeks but the team said they were ' happy ' with the repair work
