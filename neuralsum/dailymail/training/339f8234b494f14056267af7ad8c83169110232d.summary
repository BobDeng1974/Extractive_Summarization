@entity6 and @entity7 , 45 , from @entity8 who describe themselves as the ' twinniest twins ever ' and admit that they 're addicted to being identical			1
but their obsession with staying the same has come at a price : neither has ever had a relationship , partly because of their insistence on doing everything from sleeping to dating as a pair			1
' we have matching everything - we have matching jeans , matching pants , matching dresses , matching shoes ... we even have matching underwear			0
' our fingernails are always painted the same , ' chimes in @entity7			1
' we wear the exact same make - up always , exactly the same sort of pink - beige blush			0
' it is nerve wracking at the salon because whatever you 're doing to me , you have to do to her next			0
' @entity6 adds : ' @entity38 forbid one of us should break a nail , or trip and fall ... i did about a month ago and i had a scrape ... ' i was almost tempted to do it myself so i had the exact same scrape , ' confesses @entity7			1
' we 've got to keep it all alike			1
' the twins ' obsession with looking exactly the same began 20 years ago when @entity6 gained weight and was left 6kg heavier than her sister			1
@entity51 : the pair are so addicted to looking the same , they even eat exactly the same thing work : along with living together and sleeping in the same room , the sisters also share a job ' for some reason , @entity6 had gained a teeny bit more weight than me and people were like " oh , you 're the big twin and you 're the small twin " , ' remembers @entity7			1
' literally from then on out , we eat exactly the same bites of food and the same amount of drink to stay the same weight , no matter what			1
' their rule even applies to the drinks they choose when they go out and the pair carry a set of scales to measure food on the go			1
' whenever we have situations where we ca n't tell whether portions are even or not , we 'll pull out the scales and weigh it , ' explains @entity6			1
they also synchronise their workout sessions to ensure their fitness levels remain exactly the same			0
' we have to work out the exact same amount , ' says @entity7			1
' if i 'm on the treadmill for 20 minutes , she 's on the treadmill for 20 minutes because she has to do the same			0
' worried : the twin 's friend @entity92 worries about what might happen should one twin leave the other dating : the pair are so addicted to being alike , they even go on each other 's dates @entity102 she 's not a model like her @entity105 sister , but @entity102 's twin , @entity106 , is just as beautiful			1
the twins are part of a family of six girls , that also includes sisters @entity112 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
@entity117 the 45 - year - old 24 star has a twin sister who arrived seven minutes after he did			1
@entity120 also works in @entity121 but behind the camera as a production supervisor			0
@entity124 calm down ladies ! not only does the @entity127 's @entity124 have a twin , brother @entity126 is identical and as a result , just as handsome			2
@entity130 the @entity132 actor , 43 , has a twin brother named @entity134 , who unlike the rest of his thespian - heavy family , chose to become a conservationist instead			0
@entity138 although the 33 - year - old actress and her twin sister @entity139 share similar features , @entity139 is no fan of the limelight , instead choosing a quiet country life and a career as a horse breeder			2
although the twins say they 're happy with their unorthodox lifestyle , their friend @entity92 says she is concerned and worries about what might happen should they be forced apart			2
' i know other twins but they take it really over the top - they have to do every single thing together , ' she explains			2
' one day , they might have to be apart for some reason			0
and i do n't want them to be in the position where they ca n't function fully because they 're apart			0
' my main concern is that one would die before the other and the other would be lost , completely , without the other twin			0
' in a bid to help the twins , who appear on @entity170 show @entity171 , @entity92 challenges the pair to spend 24 hours apart			1
' it 's driving me crazy right now because i feel as if half of my body has been cut off , ' reveals @entity7 , who spends the challenge at home alone without her sister			1
' i will never agree to do this again			0
i miss my sister so much - i 'm literally counting the minutes until we 're together again			0
' she adds : knowing i 'm not going to be identical with my sister today is making me sick in my stomach			2
' we 're not used to it - we have n't been apart for 20 years			0
i hate being apart from my sister			0
i miss her like i miss half myself - i ca n't wait to see her			0
' reunited , the pair vow never to repeat the experiment			2
' we were so excited to see each other , ' they chime as one			0
' i just do n't want to be separated from her ever again			2
' my @entity171 , tonight at 8pm on @entity170			0
