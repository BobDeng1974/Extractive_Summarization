these quirky wooden cottages allow you to up sticks and move at a moment 's notice - as they are set on four wheels			1
the hand - crafted mobile homes are far more inviting than your bog - standard caravan and are incredibly eco-friendly			1
but motorists are unlikely to end up stuck behind one of the 22ft by 8ft homes on a west country - bound motorway as they are remaining at a farm where they provide holiday accommodation			1
the @entity19 's cottage : guests have likened this to a fairytale home because it has the appearance of a gingerbread house the 22ft by 8ft cottage is made of about a dozen different types of wood - some from the farm and some that was reclaimed @entity33 and @entity34 decided to make the two cottages movable structures to make it easier to get planning permission for them as they looked to diversify their farm business			1
guests have likened them to fairytale homes , with @entity19 's cottage looking like a gingerbread house and @entity47 like something straight out of @entity49			1
the holiday homes are completely off the grid , with no electricity or running water inside			1
each has a composting toilet nearby and a wood - fired shower just outside			2
but the cosy cottages are comfortably kitted out with a double bed , two singles that can also be used as benches , a log burner and a gas ring for cooking			1
the @entity64 , who own @entity66 in @entity67 , decided to build the cottages and run glamping breaks to help cover the costs of running their conservation farm			1
after coming up with an idea of what they wanted , they recruited local carpenters , woodsmen and other artisans to help them create @entity79			0
the project took about six months to build and sits between two wildflower meadows and next to a pond the cottage is made from about a dozen different types of wood - some from the @entity64 ' farm and reclaimed wood such as hop poles that are used to grow hops on farms			0
it sits between two wildflower meadows and next to a pond			0
the project took about six months to build and was so successful that a year later they decided to build @entity47 , which took another six months			2
with similar proportions , it sits in its own secluded dell by a chestnut and oak coppiced woodland			0
the @entity101 is on wheels and is far more inviting than your standard caravan , eco-friendly and skilfully made taking six months to erect , @entity107 's cottage has been described as something straight out of @entity49 @entity33 , 42 , said : ' we wanted something unique to us			1
there are lots of places with shepherd huts , yurts and tents , so we wanted something different			0
' my husband @entity118 sketched some ideas and then we worked with some local craftsmen to create what we wanted			0
' when we got planning consent it was easier to have them as movable structures			1
' as the farm is run for conservation , it means technically if we wanted to clear everything away tomorrow we could and leave little footprint , but we plan on keeping them where they are			0
' we 're quite unusual in that we are a working farm run purely for conservation , but conservation does n't earn a living so we had to come up with something that would cover our costs			0
@entity47 sits in its own secluded dell by a chestnut and oak coppiced woodland @entity19 's cottage is based at a farm in @entity67 , providing holiday accommodation for those looking to get back to nature ' it had to be something that fitted in with what we are all about , shared what we do with the public and worked in our surroundings			1
' we came up with the idea for accommodation and we 've been going as a glamping operation for five years now			2
' people love the cottages and our repeat business is growing			2
the cottages are entirely off the grid , which is in keeping with our eco credentials			2
' they have a little two - ring gas hob , their own firepits outside , composting loos and outdoor wood - fired showers			0
' it 's all part of the experience and we increasingly have families that want the chance to spend some quality time together and get the kids off the games consoles and mobile phones			2
' prices vary depending on the season but start from Â£ 100 a night			0
@entity180 also has two stationary wooden cabins			0
