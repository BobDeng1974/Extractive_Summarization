so , once again , it will all come down to the actions of a man from @entity3			0
on this occasion , though , the focus will not be on @entity3 ’s most famous son			0
@entity7 will be at the @entity8 tonight , forming one part of football ’s most famous three - man attack , looking to fire @entity12 into the @entity14 semi-finals			1
usually when they reach this stage , @entity12 do not make any mistakes			2
standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who @entity7 knows inside out , a player who hails from his home city in @entity22 and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country			1
@entity27 prepares for @entity29 's quarter - final clash with @entity12 @entity29 train at @entity31 in @entity29 - en - @entity32 , west of @entity33 @entity27 celebrates scoring for the @entity33 side in the @entity36 final last weekend @entity27 knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening			1
if @entity29 are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the @entity14 ’s last eight , @entity27 – a player known as @entity38 – must torment the stars from @entity42			1
the onus falls on @entity27 for a number of reasons			2
first , @entity29 have been stripped by suspension of two key players , @entity48 and @entity49 , the product of that ugly last 16 success against @entity52 ; @entity53 is injured , while @entity54 is also a major doubt			1
yet there is more to it than that			0
@entity27 has a towering reputation in the game , stemming from three prolific seasons in @entity62 which led to his record - breaking move to @entity33 , but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over ? to suggest that may seem a little harsh			1
he came within the width of a goal post at @entity70 of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in february that gave @entity76 ’s side the opportunity to travel to @entity78 with parity			0
since then , however , @entity27 has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent			2
between february 17 and april 5 , @entity27 went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the @entity90 final on saturday			2
@entity29 won that game 4 - 0 but had matters sewn up before @entity27 came on and helped himself to a double late on ( @entity48 had scored twice to give them breathing space ) ; it was his first action since an angry altercation with @entity76 a week earlier during a 3 - 2 win in @entity98			1
@entity48 slides in on @entity99 during @entity29 's second round clash at @entity52 last month @entity48 is shown the red card for his challenge on @entity99 to leave @entity29 up against it @entity48 trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter - final against @entity12 it has led to speculation about his future in @entity33 and he has been linked with a number of sides in the @entity112 ; @entity113 , for one , would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant ( he earns more per week than @entity115 )			1
@entity116 and @entity117 have also been mentioned with him , while @entity118 tested the water in june 2013 when it was clear that @entity27 ’s time in @entity122 was over ; the intensity of his play , you suspect , would enhance his prospects of thriving in the @entity128 game			1
@entity129 , @entity29 ’s president , maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises @entity27 has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in @entity136			1
‘ i came to play as a centre - forward with @entity48 and after , things changed for a variety of reasons , ’ said @entity27			1
‘ everything else is perfect in @entity33			0
the club has behaved very well towards me			0
i have had some difficult moments personally , and they protected me , supported me			0
‘ the fans have also always supported me			0
i think i 'm in one of the best places in the world			0
i 'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team , to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me			0
you never know in football			0
i 'm not thinking about it			0
’ tonight his focus will be on @entity12			2
with six goals in eight @entity14 appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team - mates – it would be risible to suggest @entity27 has something to prove on this stage			1
that said , it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment			0
@entity48 ’s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question , while @entity49 is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in @entity173 but , without them , @entity29 need their man from @entity3 to sparkle			2
their prospects depend on him			0
@entity176 is considering a move for @entity27 after seeing @entity115 struggle this season @entity27 is one of the highest - paid players in the world after moving to @entity33 from @entity181 @entity182 will come up against @entity7 , who was born in the same town , in the first leg in @entity33			1

@entity29 host @entity12 in the first leg of their @entity14 quarter - final
@entity29 are without the suspended @entity48
in his *absence* , @entity27 must raise his game as the main attacker
the @entity22 is being *courted* by @entity176 at @entity117
@entity182 will come up against @entity7 who was born in the same town
