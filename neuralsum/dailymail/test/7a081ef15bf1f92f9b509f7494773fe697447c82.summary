after five customers reported having ' thermal incidents ' , @entity0 issued a stop delivery notice to car dealers and urged owners of the @entity18 or ute - to have their cars checked out immediately this latest safety issue makes @entity0 the most recalled car brand in 2015			1
last year , @entity0 shared the title of most recalls with @entity24 after issuing 14 notices to recall around nine vehicles - including the @entity27 , the @entity28 and the @entity0 @entity29 - amid safety concerns			2
a website run by the federal government confirmed there is a risk ' cable insulation ' in the @entity36 ' may melt of catch fire			0
' @entity0 said the issue is caused by an alternator cable making unnecessary contact with a steel bracket on the battery tray			0
they said under certain driving conditions the movement of the engine could cause the cable to rub through the insulation , potentially causing a short circuit			0
this latest safety issue makes @entity0 the most recalled car brand in 2015 , with five recalls in only four months ' if the short circuit creates sufficient heat , there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire , ' @entity0 told @entity58 in a statement			1
@entity0 said drivers should look out for warning signs that their car may be affected , like a battery warning light on the dash board , or in more serious cases a ' small amount of smoke ' seen coming from the engine bay			2
earlier this month , @entity0 recalled the @entity70 - made @entity69 after concerns that the suv may lurch forward if the key was left in the ignition for too long			1
this brings @entity0 to a total of five recalls in the first four months of this year			2
@entity0 revealed that if the short circuit creates sufficient heat , there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire ( stock photo ) this comes as the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) announced figures that show the number of safety recalls in @entity89 are steadily on the rise			1
the @entity85 monitored 307 recalls in 2014 , a 14 per cent increase from 2013 where they only monitored 268 recalls			0
the figures show there has been a consistent increase in recalls dating back to 2010			0
recalls the @entity85 have monitored in @entity89 included a punching bag that contained nails and needles , a vacuum that put users at risk of electric shock and burns , an ' egg free ' ice cream that contained egg whites and a spear gun that fired without warning			2
senator @entity112 , a former @entity113 representative told @entity114 he blamed the rise in recalls on a ' systemic regulatory failure ' to protect @entity89 from substandard imported products			0
' there is definitely more faulty stuff around , but i do think that people are becoming a little bit more aware , and sick of it			0
there 's a lot of these cheap places where you can go and buy cheap stuff , but it 's not cheap if it does n't last , ' he warned .			0
