by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity2 told his son about having had a passion for ice hockey prior to 1825 @entity7 's national pride has been dealt a serious blow after @entity9 laid to inventing ice hockey - claiming @entity2 was one of the sport 's first ever participants			1
a recently - discovered letter sent by the famous naturalist in 1853 asks his young son if he has a good pond at school , adding : ' i used to be very fond of playing at @entity19 [ sic ] on the ice in skates '			1
the letter casts serious doubt on generally accepted @entity7 claims that ice hockey was invented in the country in the 1870s and that the first proper match was played in @entity29 in 1875			1
@entity2 's letter was sent to his then 13 - year - old son @entity31 , who was boarding at @entity32 at the time , on march 1 , 1853			1
' @entity33 … have you got a pretty good pond to skate on ? i used to be very fond of playing at @entity19 [ sic ] on the ice in skates , ' he wrote			2
the evolutionary theorist had himself attended the school as a boarder between 1818 and 1825 himself , and it is thought his reference to enjoying ' hockey on the ice ' relates to this time			2
if that is the case , ice hockey would have been played in @entity9 at least 50 years earlier than the first officially recognised match in @entity7 , where is it now a national sport and general obsession			1
the claim will come as something of a blow to @entity7 , who are taught to play the game almost as soon as they learn to walk			0
@entity56 - @entity55 , a member of the @entity57 , poured fuel of the fire by claiming the early 1820s was around the time that a game recognisable as ice hockey started			0
' we expect a lot of people wo n’t believe it and some will have much difficulty in believing it , ' he told @entity69			0
' it ’s something you have been told since you were the youngest age , that you ’ve been told by your parents , ' he added			0
despite potentially breaking @entity7 hearts with his claims , @entity55 gave them at least something to hold on to by suggesting the ice hockey played in @entity9 in the early 1800s would have been a slow , primitive sport compared to the high - energy , high - impact game we know and love today			1
on the @entity81 : the sport may have been played in @entity9 at least 50 years earlier than the first officially recognised match in @entity7 , where is it now a national sport and general obsession ( pictured ) ' we would n’t want to say @entity7 has no claim at all [ to the game ] – that ’s not true ... @entity7 took the game , sped it up and made it better			2
@entity7 really made the game its own and hockey is truly a @entity7 game now '			0
the @entity2 letter appears in a new book @entity95 wrote alongside two @entity97 colleagues , medical doctor @entity98 and sports writer @entity99			2
titled ' on the @entity101 ' in a deliberate nod to @entity2 's seminal work ' on the @entity104 ' , the trio also found an entry in the @entity106 dated february 16 , 1838 that backs up claims the ice hockey was being played in @entity9 in the first half of the 19th century			1
the entry reads : ' on saturday last , an amusing scene took place on a splendid sheet of ice which covered @entity114			0
' a large party from the neighbouring residence of @entity117			0
@entity118 , @entity119 , of @entity120 , drove up in sledges to the pond			0
' the ladies were drawn upon the ice in traineau , while the gentlemen performed various feats upon their skates : after going through several quadrilles , reels and playing a warmly contested game at hockey , the party partook of a cold collation , and again stepping into their sledges , glided swiftly away			0
' reacting to the claims made in the book , @entity137 newspaper @entity136 called the idea of ice hockey being invented in @entity9 a ' puck - shattering thought ' , adding it is ' sure to rankle @entity7 hockey patriots ' .			1

letter suggests @entity2 played hockey in @entity9 before 1825
he wrote to son in 1853 *reminiscing* about his time at @entity32
said he ' used to be very fond ' of playing hockey ' on the ice in skates '
contradicts @entity7 claims that the sport was invented in the country
players are taught that the sport was first played in @entity29 in 1870s
