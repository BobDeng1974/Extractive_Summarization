by @entity0 a 13 - year - old girl who turned her back on an acting career today followed in her hero @entity5 's footsteps to become one of the youngest @entity8 athletes to compete at the @entity9			1
@entity10 , nicknamed @entity11 , is the youngest member of @entity12 who today competed in the women 's 10m platform final tonight and etched her name into the history books			1
a podium finish was beyond her grasp despite an impressive performance , made all the more so considering some of the athletes she was competing against have more than a decade of experience over her			2
she finished 10th out of 12 but this competition certainly wo n't be the last that is heard from this burgeoning talent			1
earlier today she qualified for the finals after finishing eighth in the preliminaries with a total score of 297.30			0
she and her mother now live in @entity45 , the home of @entity61 diving , after her talent was spotted by @entity5 's dive coach @entity63 in 2012			1
the opportunity was too good to pass up - he offered to tutor her through @entity45 's elite diving programme			1
her father @entity40 , 53 , remains in @entity44 where he works as a @entity69 train driver and visits his wife and daughter every few weeks			1
he told @entity72 : ' the great thing is that @entity63 recognises that there is life after diving , so he knows she has to apply herself at school as well			2
' fortunately , she ’s very bright , pretty much straight @entity79 in everything , which probably comes from that competitiveness as well			0
' @entity29 pictured in 2009 during her brief acting career - which she has now dropped to focus on her diving she recently told @entity84 of her promising prospects as an actor , which she has now put aside to focus on her diving			2
' i did n’t really take an interest in it after i found sport , ' she said			0
' it did n’t seem as fun as it used to be			0
@entity94 has a bit more of a zing and zang , if that ’s how you say it			0
' unlike most other 13 - year - olds , the teenager 's @entity102 page is littered with selfies , pictures and tweets of her with @entity12 athletes and established superstars such as sir @entity110			1
but her most prized possession remains ' my teddy bear and my reading books ' , according to her swimming biography			1
and following a career path forged by @entity5 , who rose to stardom after competing at the @entity117 at the age of 14 , @entity29 has carved out a reputation with a series of promising results despite taking up the sport only a few years ago			2
however , her road to the @entity124 has not been an easy one			0
after winning the 10m title at the @entity128 in june , games organisers initially said she was too young to compete			0
rules set by @entity131 , the sport 's international governing organisation , state athletes must be in the year of their 14th birthday to compete at the @entity134 or other international competitions			1
but an appeal lodged by @entity12 , on the basis other 13 - year - olds have competed - was successful			0
@entity5 , pictured when he was just 14 at a press conference during the @entity117 a 19 - year - old @entity5 competing in the finals of the @entity141 in @entity44 earlier this year the appeal victory led to excitement for both @entity12 and @entity29			2
she tweeted : ' i am glad to say that after the long appeal i 've been told i can go to @entity9 ! ! i 'm over the moon ! ' @entity148 said : ' i am delighted that @entity30 has been included in our diving squad and i 'd like to thank the @entity151 for their support in this matter			0
' @entity30 will be our youngest member of @entity12 and a welcome addition to our diving team			0
