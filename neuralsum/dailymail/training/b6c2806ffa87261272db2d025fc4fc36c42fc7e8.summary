@entity1 's desire to land @entity2 was handed a timely boost after @entity4 agreed to join @entity5 on sunday night			2
the @entity7 champions have been offered the @entity8 forward and want to add him to their midst before the transfer window shuts on monday , with @entity12 also keen but unlikely to win the race			1
a meeting at @entity1 is underway , expected to ratify the transfer which is £ 25million plus add - ons of £ 2m - and @entity1 believe that is good business			2
@entity1 's pursuit was always dependent on whether they were able to recoup money for @entity4 , who is set to join the @entity39 side on loan with a view to a £ 20million move back to @entity23			1
the clubs are yet to finalise a deal , but @entity4 has agreed to the move after @entity5 president , @entity46 , director of football @entity47 and @entity50 's right - hand man at the club , @entity49 , travelled to @entity52 to meet face - to - face with the player 's agents			0
their aim was to offer personal terms to the @entity59 international and figure out how to get a deal done with @entity1 , with @entity4 taking a pay cut to push through a transfer			0
@entity63 watched his @entity1 side uncharacteristically struggle going forward in the defeat against @entity66 over the weekend and he would not rule out a move for @entity2 afterwards			1
complications : @entity63 spoke of the difficulties @entity1 have been enduring in the transfer market splurge : @entity28 are n't thought to be keen on @entity2 after spending £ 60million on @entity71 the manager spoke about having time to do business and added ' we will see what happens ' after laying bare the problems they were finding in financing any potential deals			1
' we have a restriction about the amount of money we can spend and the amount of players we can use , ' @entity63 said			0
@entity84 provides a huge stumbling block for @entity1 - who were fined £ 49million by @entity87 in june for breaking monetary rules - and they always had to get the injured @entity4 off the wage bill in order to finance a move ; they also need to free up space in the squad for another foreign import			2
that looked a tall order on sunday morning , made worse by @entity2 seemingly confirming he was leaving for @entity52 on @entity97			0
but @entity98 instead moved to sign @entity28 's @entity99 on loan on a fast - paced day before the deadline in which @entity2 appeared to be offered to a plethora of clubs across @entity104			1
@entity4 will remain at the @entity105 should they fail to sort a deal out for the @entity108			0
heading for the exit : @entity99 is close to sealing a loan move to @entity52			0

@entity23 striker is moving on loan with a view to a £ 20million move
@entity63 wants to add @entity2 to his squad
@entity1 lost 1 - 0 against @entity66 on *saturday*
