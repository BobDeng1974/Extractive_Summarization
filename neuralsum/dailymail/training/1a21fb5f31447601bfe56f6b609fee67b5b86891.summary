there ’s not a car in sight , the birds are singing in the nearby trees … and the tube station is just around the corner			2
granted , it ’s not exactly your archetypal stately pile , not least because the grounds stretch out for no more than half an acre , but with a price tag of £ 105million , and tucked out of sight in an upmarket area of central @entity21 , @entity17 is set to become @entity23 ’s most expensive home to be sold on the open market			1
it is currently owned by professor @entity26 , the @entity27 heir to the @entity29 auto fortune who is worth an estimated £ 350million			2
despite being a vast property , there would be no way of knowing it exists with entry via a discreet , unsuspecting drive mr @entity26 's father , @entity37 , established the family 's industrial empire by founding a conglomerate during the @entity41 between 1919 and 1933			0
he was found guilty of war crimes at the @entity43 in 1947 after using an estimated 48,000 labourers from @entity46 concentration camps within his many enterprises , of whom an estimated 80 per cent died from work - related causes			1
though originally a member of the liberal @entity51 , he donated over seven million marks to the @entity53 from 1933 onwards , before being sentenced to seven years imprisonment following the tribunal which has become known as @entity56			0
he was subsequently pardoned and went on to become the richest man in @entity58 before dying in 1972			0
@entity59 has two children from different marriages , and lived in the property with his third wife , dr @entity63			0
the property is on the market with @entity66 for £ 105 million			0
@entity59 is selling the home he shares with his third wife , @entity68 , for £ 105million @entity37 is pictured facing sentencing for war crimes at his 1947 tribunal which formed part of the @entity43 brought against @entity53 members and cooperatives this makes the nine - figure home the most expensive on the open market and 640 times the £ 164,000 typically paid for a house in @entity80 and @entity81			1
it is 275 times the price of the average home in @entity21 and is one of only nine homes that fetch nine figures in the capital			1
but despite the price - tag , which would incur a stamp duty charge of £ 7.35 million , the beautiful property is not expected to be on the market for long			1
there is also planning permission to enlarge the home by approximately 8,000sq/ft with a subterranean extension to include a 50ft swimming pool along with gym and cinema as well as three further bedrooms above the drawing room			0
professor @entity26 has a phd in @entity103 from the @entity104 and is a scholar of @entity107 art history covering the period from the 16th - 19th centuries			1
@entity26 is a prolific buyer of artwork and antiques with @entity17 playing home to one of the world 's finest silver collections			1
he said : ' i was attracted to it because it is almost a country house in the middle of @entity21			2
from no window can you see a car passing by			0
' i am not really leaving @entity21 but might relocate for a year to @entity124 , where i have a home			0

@entity17 in @entity127 is set in just half an acre of land and is 640 times the average house price in the @entity23
it is just one of nine homes across the @entity23 that are in the nine - figure price *bracket*
