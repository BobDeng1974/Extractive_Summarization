the nine skydivers who stared death in the face after two planes they were on collided 12,000 feet in the air said today it has n't put them off the extreme sport because it is a ' part of who they are '			1
what was supposed to be a moment of perfectly - timed air acrobatics and exhilarating free - falls turned into a terrifying jump - for - your - life situation when one @entity13 suddenly sandwiched on top of the other - and it was all captured on camera			2
the experienced skydivers , from @entity18 , appeared on the today show as the incredible footage from their helmet cams was played			1
' that 's probably the worst , was hearing him scream , ' she said through tears			2
' it 's pretty raw			1
' brave : this skydiver describes how me made his way over to the plane that was on fire ( while free falling ) to see if the pilot was ok calm under pressure : blake the pilot describes flying his plane after the collision and landing it safely which , they joked , was one of his better landings in one shot , tiny black figures can be made out free - falling through the sky as one of the planes fireballs in the distance , with large chunks of it breaking off			1
when asked by @entity25 if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape , all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders that jumping			1
' it 's what we do			2
it 's just part of who we are , ' they explained			2
@entity78 revealed he tried to chase the plane that was on fire as he was free - falling to see if the pilot was ok and when he saw him jump from the plane , he chased him to make sure he could open his chute			1
' @entity85 had parachutes on , so they were kind of on their own , so i chased the plane			1
i think @entity89 did too , he came down with me , ' he said			0
' we chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out			0
once i saw the pilot bail out , i made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a student			1
' @entity96 said : ' i thought it was a joke at first			0
obviously not a very funny or appropriate one			0
but it was all so surreal			0
' i thought oh my @entity100 they 're getting closer			0
i expected the other plane to move away			2
' incredible : five of the skydivers involved in the @entity18 plane crash on saturday fall from the sky after the aircraft accidentally collided , causing one to erupt in flames impact : the skydivers were perched on the edge of the plane ready to jump as the other one hit , causing a massive fire bomb exact : this is the moment the two planes hit , sending two divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft @entity120 , who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said : ' it was unpleasant			1
i had no time to react ...			0
the sound behind me , i 'll never forget			0
' and that 's all i could do was try and stay forward and try not to move because i knew i was going to live where i was , or thought i could			0
' @entity127 could not contain her emotions while recounting the collision			2
through tears she said she remembers the pilot screaming at them ' @entity36 ' , ordering them to jump			0
' that 's probably the worst , was hearing him scream			0
' @entity137 , who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at @entity142 in @entity143 , joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred			1
' everything was as it should have been , ' he said			0
' we were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane , ' said 64 - year - old flight instructor @entity152 , who was in the lead plane			1
' if we 'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different			0
' both wings came off the lead plane in the collision and the pilot had to abandon the plane using a parachute on board			1
he was the only one with reported injuries , suffering from cuts as he exited the burning plane			2
watch video here ... falling : one of the divers tumbles out of the plane just after impact once out of the plane , the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris			1
' we 're in free fall , so we 're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically down , ' mr @entity152 said			0
' but then we open our parachutes , and now all of a sudden they 're falling faster than we are ... fortunately , everybody kept it together so they just avoided ( the debris )			0
' all 11 on board the two planes survived the collision			1
the only person injured was the pilot of the lead plane , who was taken to the hospital for minor injuries			1
' he may need some stitches , but he 's not seriously hurt , ' mr @entity152 said			0
split apart : both wings of the lead plane became detached and @entity152 said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces falling pieces : several people in the superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris miraculously , no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground			1
@entity212 lives in the area and often hears and sees the skydivers , but he noticed something was off about yesterday 's jump			2
' i went outside and looked and could see parachuters and a drop plane , and then there was something spiraling down			2
i could n't identify what it was			0
. it had a trail of smoke and i had never seen that before , ' he said			0
happy to be alive : two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely quick thinking : the pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely , but the lead plane was not so lucky			1
it crashed to the ground in several piece			0
the pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well while mr @entity152 still does n't know why exactly the two planes collided , he believes the lead plane may have created unstable air for the tracking plane			1
the @entity244 will investigate the crash today			1
it 's still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company , since they only owned the two planes			2
but it is the end of their season anyway			0
mr @entity152 says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of his day , and that he 's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime			1
' i 'll remember this one more than most , ' he said .			0

footage *emerged* from the @entity18 plane crash on the *weekend* that saw nine skydivers make *emergency* jumps from their planes after a collision
*majority* of the video taken from the helmet of one of the divers , @entity269 , who inside the lead plane when it made contact with the second , causing an eruption of flames
she cried on the today show as she recalled the ' still raw ' accident
