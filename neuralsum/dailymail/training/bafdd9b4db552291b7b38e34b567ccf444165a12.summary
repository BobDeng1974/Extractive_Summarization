by @entity0 a black bear invited himself to a one - year - old 's birthday party in @entity4 at the weekend and promptly tucked into the cupcakes			1
the birthday boy 's parents , @entity8 and @entity9 , were stunned when the 180 pound male bear crashed through a skylight at their @entity13 home on saturday , just minutes before the party was to start			1
' i heard my husband yelling , so i poked my head around the corner and there was this crash , ' @entity8 told @entity21			1
' and a bear landed on the ottoman			2
' she saw her husband just three feet from the bear - and for a moment , he and the animal just stared at each other in disbelief			1
birthday snack : @entity8 holds cupcakes that a bear licked after falling into her @entity4 home on saturday just moments before the start of her boyfriend 's one - year birthday party @entity38 ushered his parents and son , @entity41 , upstairs and went into another room and shut the door , while his wife stood watching from behind a glass door as he helped himself to the birthday treats			1
' the bear walks over to the table and starts eating the cupcakes , ' @entity8 said			1
' i was like , " of course ! " i thought he might be a bit shaken up after falling through the ceiling but all he could think about was the cupcakes			2
' he tested out both the lemon blueberry and peanut butter cupcakes			0
she added : ' all i could think was , " i just spent hours setting up and guests are about to arrive ! " ' but as he tucked in , she tiptoed into the room and opened a door to the outside			0
the couple were able to shoo him out - but he was n't done with those cakes			2
' he walked around the house and want back over to the window where the food was , ' she said			2
' like " i want more cupcakes "			0
' still smiling : @entity9 holds his son @entity41 , whose birthday party was rudely interrupted by the uninvited guest on saturday			1
the bear had fallen through a skylight , which can be seen broken the bear eventually left the home when @entity78 , 45 , went next door and grabbed some bear spray from neighbors			1
the couple said that the animal seemed used to people and was not aggressive			0
the party still went ahead - with the couple quickly attempting to patch up the broken skylight before moving the celebrations into a different room			1
@entity8 told @entity21 she thinks the bear was able to get on the skylight by climbing onto a gas tank outside their home and jumping up on to the low roof			1
she added that it was lucky that the bear arrived early for the party			2
' how he landed from the sky light , he landed on our ottoman , ' she said			0
' our son is often in that room and always around the ottoman - so we were really lucky he was n't there			2
' we 're definitely used to seeing bears but having one crash through your ceiling is a huge surprise			0
we were all in shock			0
' police received a call from the couple and about 30 minutes later , received another saying there was a similar bear inside a nearby home			1
when officers arrived , they shot the animal when it appeared in the doorway			0
the bear ran behind the house , where it was later found dead			2
tragic end : the black bear was shot dead after it broke into another nearby home ( file picture ) wildlife officials suspect it was the same bear that went to the birthday party			1
it was described in both incidents as a young male , weighing about 180 pounds			0
@entity8 said she is not completely sure that the bears were the same as they often see the animals in the area , and a reporter on the way to their house noticed a similar one crossing the road outside			1
authorities told @entity145 that seeing the bears was a regular occurrence			0
' there probably is n't a neighborhood or place where we have homes where the potential is n't there for you to run into a bear or observe a bear , ' @entity148 of the @entity149 said			0
' there is really no place where the potential is n't there			0
' he added that the officers were forced to kill the animal found in the nearby house because it was a threat to the family			1
' we do nâ€™t take killing or destroying bears lightly , ' he said			0
' people were inside that building			0
i think it was appropriate for that given the situation			0

@entity8 and @entity9 were setting up for their son 's party at their @entity4 home when the 180 pound bear crashed through their skylight
after running into other rooms , they watched in disbelief as the bear licked the cupcakes
they eventually forced him out - but he *continued* to look at the cakes through the window until they used bear spray
but 30 minutes later , police got a call that a bear was in a nearby house and they *fatally* shot him ; authorities believe it was the same bear
