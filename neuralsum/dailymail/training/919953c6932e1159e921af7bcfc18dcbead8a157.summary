@entity0 appears as an insignificant - looking pale blue dot below @entity3 's majestic rings in a breathtaking new image from the @entity6 spacecraft			1
the picture was captured on july 19 by the probe 's wide - angle camera from a distance of 900 million miles			1
magnifying the image five times reveals not only the @entity0 but also the moon , a fainter smudge to the right of the planet			0
the images were taken by the @entity6 spacecraft , which has been orbiting the ringed giant since its arrival in the @entity3 system in 2004 , and astronomer @entity23 , who oversees the @entity6 imaging team at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity17 said : ' the whole event underscores for me our ' coming of age ' as planetary explorers			1
' a tiny spot : @entity0 can been seen as just a miniscule star from this enhanced shot of @entity3 taken by the @entity37 spacecraft @entity6 nearly 900million miles away magnified : an @entity39 physicist blew up the images of the @entity0 to show our planet and the moon as they might look from a telescope from @entity3 this shows the first image of @entity0 captured from the outer solar system taken by @entity37 's @entity48 in 1990 , titled ' @entity49 ' after the event , she tweeted : ' was n't it fabulous ? ! i thought of all of you and all the people around the globe thinking the same thoughts i was			1
felt so connected to everyone			0
the @entity0 has only been pictured in images from outer space on two other occasions			0
the first was in 1990 , when @entity48 captured an image from 3.7 billion miles away			0
the second occasion was when @entity6 took a photo in 2006 from 926 million miles away			2
@entity37 took the image on july 19 because @entity3 was backlit by the @entity67 and @entity0 was included in the picture			2
@entity70 , @entity6 lead scientist at the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity69 said : ' we ca n't see individual continents or people in this portrait of @entity0 , but this pale blue dot is a succinct summary of who we were on july 19			1
' @entity6 snapped the picture on friday , the same day @entity37 's @entity81 - orbiting messenger probe imaged @entity0 as well			1
in that picture , @entity0 and the moon take up less than a pixel , but appear large because they are overexposed			0
' that images of our planet have been acquired on a single day from two distant solar system outposts reminds us of this nation 's stunning technical accomplishments in planetary exploration , ' said @entity95 lead scientist @entity94 , with @entity96 in @entity97			1
the raw images of @entity0 that arrived back home from @entity3 on saturday were raw and not easy for the average layman to decipher			2
the images showed both wide and narrow - angle views and different shots were taken with different color filters , additionally , @entity6 moved slightly in between shots			0
usually , spacecraft in the far reaches of the solar system do n't look back toward @entity0 to avoid damaging their instruments by direct sunlight			2
last week , the sun was temporarily blocked relative to @entity6 's line of sight , allowing the @entity117 space agency to take the picture			0
say cheese ! thousands of people posed for @entity6 's pictures - though the gesture was obviously just symbolic the blue dot of @entity0 as seen from @entity3 appearing as a bright smudge with the fainter moon to its right			1
the picture was captured from a distance of 898 million miles by @entity37 's @entity6 spacecraft @entity130 , an image processor and social - media leader for the ' in @entity134 ' film project , produced an unofficial color image composite of the raw data that was sent back			1
@entity137 , a physicist at @entity39 's @entity138 , tweeted a zoomed - in shot of @entity0 - as seen from nearly 900million miles away			0
thousands of @entity140 looked up at @entity3 and waved at 2.30pm @entity141 on friday to participate in the symbolic # @entity142 and # @entity144 campaigns at the time @entity6 was shooting the pictures			0
photo bomb : @entity0 will appear in the image @entity37 is trying to capture of @entity3 star gazing : @entity3 could be seen from @entity150 's night sky at the time the images were taken from @entity6 photos show staffers at @entity37 's @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity69 , participating			1
costumed sci - fi fans at @entity158 in @entity154 - including a few @entity155 from @entity156 - also posed for the pictures			0
the main purpose of the photograph is to study any changes in @entity3 's rings , after an 2006 image showed possible changes			2
' a previous mosaic of the @entity3 system @entity6 made in 2006 revealed that the dusty e ring , which is fed by the water - ice plume of the @entity170 , had unexpectedly large variations in brightness and color around its orbit , ' @entity6 scientist @entity70 said			2
' we 'll want to see how that looks seven @entity0 years and a @entity3 season later , giving us clues to the forces at work in the @entity3 system , ' she said .			0

photos taken from @entity3 by @entity37 's @entity183 as a tiny pale blue dot
the images have been *transmitted* from 898 million miles away on the outer edge of our solar system
