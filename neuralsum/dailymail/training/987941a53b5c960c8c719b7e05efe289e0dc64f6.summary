@entity0 went to dinner at @entity2 not knowing much about wine			1
he left having learned a harsh lesson			0
@entity0 and his companions were taking a business dinner at the @entity8 restaurant in the @entity9 , and while ordering the wine he asked the server for a recommendation			1

i asked how much and she said , " thirty - seven fifty			1
" ' in the words of @entity0 , he thought he meant $ 37.50 , the table approved and the wine was ordered			1
when the bill came , the host who had agreed to cover the dinner was shocked to find it totaled over $ 4,000			0
at the top of the list of items ordered was the @entity27 , but with the staggeringly high price tag of $ 3,750			2
in the words of another dining companion @entity48 , when the bill came , ' we all had a heart attack			0
' the party complained that the waitress had been misleading when she informed @entity0 and the other guests about the price of the wine			1
misled : @entity0 claims he heard the waitress say ' thirty - seven fifty ' and only assumed that the bottle only cost $ 37.50 high life : the diners in the party had expected an expensive dinner of steak and seafood , but the $ 3,750 was a shock , especially for @entity0 , who did not often drink wine 100 point : @entity27 is considered one of the best bottles of wine in the world - and is priced as such , fetching over $ 1000 a bottle at auction the restaurant offered to drop the price of the wine to $ 2,200 , which the party begrudgingly accepted			1
' as the leading culinary destination in this region , we consistently serve as many , if not more high - end wine and spirits without incident , ' executive vice president @entity78 said			0
' in this isolated case , both the server and sommelier verified the bottle requested with the patron , ' said @entity78 , who claimed the host did not ' say anything to management			0
' the unidentified host of the dinner reportedly confirmed to @entity18 that he did learn the price before the bill was handed out , but that the bottle was open and likely empty so he kept quiet			2
according to the restaurant 's menu , the bottle recommended was the second most expensive for its size			0
so how was the wine ? self - declared wine amateur @entity0 says , ' it was okay			2
' for those looking for the experience of enjoying shockingly expensive wine in the comfort of their own home , bottles of @entity27 's 2011 vintage sell at auction beginning around $ 1000 .			0
