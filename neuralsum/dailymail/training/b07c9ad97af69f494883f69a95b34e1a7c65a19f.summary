a road safety row has erupted as the government prepares to turn the @entity3 hard shoulder into the country ’s first controversial permanent traffic lane from next week			1
the @entity6 says the big switch - on will ease congestion on @entity10 ’s busiest motorway – the @entity3			1
but motoring groups say it will put motorists at ‘ added risk ’			1
they say the distances between new safety ‘ refuges ’ are too far apart and there are too few overhead gantries for variable signs			0
the new lane system is an attempt to push the roads into a more hi - tech world , with changeable signs and ' refuge points ' instead of hard shoulders lanes will be controlled by cameras , variable signs and sensors in a bid to ease the gridlock – and the idea is to be rolled out to other motorways across the @entity10			1
inevitably , a new generation of hi - tech speed cameras – understood to be capable of capturing speeding cars across multiple lanes - will police the variable speed limits			0
but the @entity41 voiced ‘ significant road safety reservations ’ and caution fearing that permanent removal of the hard shoulder could increase road safety risks because breakdowns and other emergencies will have to take place in a live traffic lane			1
it said the space between refuges – every 1.5 miles – was too great and should be around every 800 yards			0
and @entity55 technical director @entity54 said : ‘ we have raised concerns with the @entity6 about the added risk arising from increased distance between emergency refuge areas , and we are disappointed so far at the absence of action to address them			2
" the sombre caution is in sharp contrast to the upbeat message from the government ’s @entity6 crowing that the switch means the @entity3 will become ‘ the smartest ’ motorway in the country			1
around 20 miles ( 32km ) of the @entity3 will feature this hard - shoulder running , which has been trialled , but only at certain times , on various motorways , starting with a section of the @entity75 in the @entity76 in 2006			1
until now the lanes have had a hard shoulder to allow for traffic to flow even if there is an accident , or for people to take refuge when their car breaks down , but now they are being abolished from monday , the hard shoulder between junctions 23 and 25 on the @entity3 in @entity87 will be available for use by vehicles			1
then next month the hard shoulder will be available for traffic between junctions 5 and 6/7 of the motorway on the @entity95 / @entity94 border			2
@entity6 senior project manager @entity96 said : ‘ around £ 1.7billion is being invested into roads in south east @entity98 by 2021 with 145 new lane miles ( 233km ) of capacity added			2
‘ soon the smart motorway will be complete and we are now asking drivers to get smart and find out more about how to use it , the types of signs and signals they will see and what to do in the event of a breakdown			2
’ he added : ’ this really is the start of a new age on @entity98 ’s motorways			0
’ but aa roads policy head @entity116 said : ‘ @entity98 ’s first ‘ all - lane running ’ motorway with no hard shoulder should be treated with caution by drivers			1
this is the first time the hard - shoulder has been ditched completely			0
‘ it marks a significant shift in @entity10 motorway policy : rather than conventional widening , ‘ making best use ’ now uses existing carriageway with technology controlling traffic			2
the @entity41 has said the new road rules should be treated with caution by drivers , as they could pose unseen risks ' it is much cheaper but can hopefully safely provide the desperately needed extra capacity to reduce chronic congestion			1
’ mr @entity116 noted : ‘ whilst we welcome the congestion - busting aspects of the scheme the @entity41 has significant reservations			2
' permanent hard shoulder removal means that breakdowns and other emergencies could take place in a live traffic lane rather than the hard shoulder			1
’ mr @entity116 said : ‘ new ' smart ' motorways depend on drivers complying with the rules of the road and safety advice			0
safety also depends on a rapid response to incidents on the part of the road operator and technology			0
’ speed limits on the new ‘ smart ’ section of the @entity3 will be policed by new ‘ stealth ’ motorway cameras which can photograph cars across four separate lanes			1
the new @entity164 3 cameras – which are almost indistinguishable from conventional cctv cameras			0
they will be mounted on gantries and on poles by the side of the road			0
but unlike most speed cameras , they will be painted a dull grey rather than bright yellow – a move forced on ministers who insisted such cameras were ‘ safety ’ not revenue - raising , following an angry backlash from drivers			2
and there will be no tell - tale calibration road - markings			0
there will however be signs warning of cameras in operation			0
the cameras are also to be used on other of @entity10 ’s busiest motorways including stretches of the @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity3			2
the @entity6 insisted they will be ‘ visible ’ but confirmed : ‘ they will not be painted yellow			0
’ he accepted that the @entity6 has ‘ gone to great lengths to minimise risk and build - in safety ’ but said it had also ‘ cut back too hard ’ on the technology used in the @entity75 pilot @entity196 said : ‘ for example , on @entity3 there will be far fewer gantries and the emergency refuge area spacing is too great at 1.5 miles ( 2.5 kilometres )			1
mr @entity116 said : ‘ a third more road space on one of the @entity10 ’s busiest sections of motorway will ease the daily stress of hundreds of thousands of drivers			1
however , they will have to come to terms with there being no hard shoulder and a need to follow strictly speed and lane instructions			0
’ in an aa - @entity218 poll some 63per cent of the 21,510 respondents agreed they would be more nervous driving on a motorway with no hard shoulder			0
and nearly 9 out of ten ( 87per cent ) also agreed that having hard shoulders are what make motorways safe			0
by contrast nearly eight out of ten ( 77per cent ) disagreed that because modern cars are more reliable hard shoulders are not @entity228 jams and gridlock on the @entity3 have caused it to be nicknamed ‘ @entity232 ’s biggest car - park ’ , mr @entity116 said : ‘ at least the drivers trapped by regular chronic congestion on the @entity3 may breathe a sigh of relief but those unfortunate enough to be stopped in lane one may take a sharp intake of breath on occasions			1
’ ‘ motorways are our safest roads and that is how we want it to stay			0

*highways* agency preparing to turn @entity3 into first ' permanent traffic lane '
they say the big switch - on will ease congestion on the busy motorway
motoring groups say it will put motorists at ' added risks '
drivers must stop on ' refuge points ' , but many say they *'re* too far apart
