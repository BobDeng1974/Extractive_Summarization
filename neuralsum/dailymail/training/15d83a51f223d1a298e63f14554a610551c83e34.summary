the @entity1 have stopped the government from ‘ really delivering ’ on immigration reform , @entity0 claimed today			1
the prime minister said he needed a @entity6 majority after the next election because he had not been able to ‘ go ahead with all the things we wanted to do ’			1
mr @entity0 ’s remarks come after he pledged to make reform of @entity13 freedom of movement rules the centrepiece of his @entity17 renegotiation if he wins the next election			1
@entity0 ( centre ) with the @entity6 candidate for @entity20 and @entity21 ( left ) were shown around the @entity23 site in @entity24 , @entity25 , by site manager @entity26 yesterday the pm claimed he had already restricted the benefits migrants could claim – but admitted further reform would be ‘ tough ’			1
speaking to @entity25 this morning , ahead of the crunch november 20 @entity20 and @entity21 by - election , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i believe at the next election i ’ve got a very strong case to say you ’ve seen what we ’ve done in @entity36 , having to make some compromises , not being able to go ahead with all the things we wanted to do – now give us the chance to really deliver for the country , including on issues like immigration			1
’ mr @entity0 said freedom of movement within the @entity46 was not ‘ an unqualified right ’			1
he said : ‘ you ca n’t come here and immediately claim benefits			2
we ’ve said that if you come here and claim benefits , that after six months you should go home			2
we ’ve said that if you come here and you ca n’t support yourself and you ’re begging on the streets you should return to the country you came from			0
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ we ’ve already made qualifications , but my view is that there is a lot more we can do to make sure that we properly control immigration into our country , both from outside the @entity46 , where we ’ve cut migration quite substantially under this government , but we also need to take steps with @entity13 as well			1
‘ as far as i ’m concerned the @entity66 public are the boss , they ’ve made it very clear they want this issue sorted out , and that ’s exactly what i want to do			0
’ @entity72 has allegedly vetoed a proposal to cap the number of migrants allowed @entity66 every year the prime minister insisted the @entity77 chancellor @entity72 shared some of his concerns about immigration – amid claims she had vetoed plans to put a cap on the number of migrants allowed into @entity66 each year			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve had good conversations with @entity72 about this , and she ’s talked about the issues they ’ve had in @entity77 with the problems of migration and particularly this issue of people being able to claim benefits			1
‘ so look , of course we ’re not all instantly going to agree , and of course this will be a tough negotiation , but the point i ’d make is look , you ’ve got one leader , @entity0 , the conservative party … who have a very clear view that we need to have a renegotiation and then a referendum on @entity13			1
‘ we have a plan to bring our immigration under control , and i do n’t hear that plan either from @entity111 or the @entity1 or indeed @entity112			0
because of course if you vote @entity112 you probably end up with a @entity111 government and no immigration control at all			0
' far right leader @entity116 used mr @entity0 's struggle to control immigration as an ' example ' of why @entity120 should leave the @entity46 miss @entity121 wrote : ' we are not free to decide our immigration policy and the example of mr @entity0 recently proved ' mr @entity0 said he wanted to change @entity66 's relationship with @entity13			1
he said : ' i do n’t want a referendum today because i ’m not satisfied with the way @entity13 is working today			0
‘ but i believe that if you put forward a strong case for renegotiation , hold that renegotiation , get a better deal , we can address issues like immigration			2
‘ in the end , it ’s not going to be my decision whether @entity66 stays or leaves the @entity46			2
‘ i ’m a positive person , i want to put a positive approach to this which is to get the changes we need , but in the end it will be for the people of @entity66 , the people of @entity20 and @entity21 to decide to stay in on these new terms or leave			0
’ he dismissed a suggestion that the @entity149 should make an election pact with @entity112 to shore up support in marginal consituencies			0
‘ i do n’t believe in deals and pacts			0
the next election is absolutely wide open , and it could easily result , if people vote the right way , in a @entity6 - only government			2
‘ that ’s what i ’m campaigning for and nothing ’s going to distract me between now and then			0
‘ people know with me that i will always try and do the right thing for @entity66			0

@entity165 said a @entity6 majority was needed to *overhaul* @entity17 migration rules
mr @entity0 has vowed to make immigration centrepiece of @entity46 renegotiation
he claimed migrant benefits already cut but admitted further reform ' tough '
