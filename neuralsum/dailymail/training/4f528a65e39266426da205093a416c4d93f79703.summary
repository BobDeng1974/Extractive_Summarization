a study has found women who have close relationships with their mother will bond better with their babies if you had a dysfunctional relationship with your mother it could mean you are more likely to have problems bonding with your own babies			1
lower levels of the ' love hormone ' oxytocin have been found in women who are not close with their own mother , a report suggests			1
women with lower oxytocin levels were more likely to experience negative feelings towards their babies , which include resentment , depression and separation anxiety			1
the findings could be useful in identifying at - risk mothers and helping them break the cycle so mums can develop these crucial bonds , says first author of the paper , @entity31 professor @entity30 , chair of infant , child and adolescent psychiatry			1
professor @entity30 and colleagues are now focusing on the application of the theory of attachment to assist women with troubled maternal relationships bond with their babies			2
' what we are now developing is attachment - based cognitive behavioural therapy for mums to reframe their own perspectives and attitudes to fix problems that have been pre-programmed , ' he said			0
he anticipates this type of therapy could be used on its own or in combination with a synthetic version of oxytocin , in the form of a puffer or nasal spray			0
for the study published in @entity59 , professor @entity30 and colleagues followed 680 pregnant women at @entity63 's @entity62			2
from this group they selected 100 women - half of whom reported troubled relationships with their mothers , while the others reported close childhood ties with their mother			1
blood samples were taken before and three months after birth to measure oxytocin levels			0
the women also completed a range of questionnaires to assess their early relationship with their parents , with others and with their newborn			2
the group with troubled maternal relationships showed a clear deficit in oxytocin , @entity30 said			0
oxytocin triggers a dopamine reward response in the brain that promotes newborn bonding as a pleasurable activity			0
in the baby , this bonding sets lifelong oxytocin release pathways that , if compromised , will influence the child 's own future attachment relationships , he said			0

women with lower levels of ' love hormone ' are more likely to have had a dysfunctional relationship with their mother
those women tend to experience negative feelings towards their own babies
a new study by the @entity31 hopes the findings can help identify mothers at risk and help break the cycle
