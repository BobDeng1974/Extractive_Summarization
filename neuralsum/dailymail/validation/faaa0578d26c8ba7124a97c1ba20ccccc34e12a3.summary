the police in @entity1 tweeted this week that they would be investigating the ‘ crime ’ of @entity3 not having picked enough @entity1 players in his 23 - man squad			1
they later tweeted that the @entity8 winning coach was ‘ beyond reproach ’ and ‘ thanks to everyone for their sense of humour ’			1
some had not seen the funny side of the forces of law and order spending time tweeting about the national team but others were too busy agreeing to criticize the tweet			0
@entity1 could easily have had striker @entity20 , midfielder @entity21 and defender @entity22 in the squad			0
likewise @entity26 ’s @entity25 contingent could point to @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 goalkeeper @entity30 as unlucky absentees			1
@entity26 's squad trains at the @entity33 in @entity34 ahead of their game against @entity36 @entity3 will be hoping to build a new golden generation after @entity26 's @entity8 nightmare @entity3 takes training on thursday ahead of their clash with @entity36 in @entity42 of @entity44 qualifying @entity46 midfielder @entity45 in action on the pitch in @entity34 ahead of the match the strength of a squad can always be judged by the quality of players that do n’t make it and the controversy about this squad selection shows just how @entity26 ’s options should make them optimistic ahead of @entity58 2016			1
the hangover from their dismal group exit at the last @entity8 still hangs over the team but @entity3 has been at pains to remind everyone this week that they remain @entity67 champions and go to @entity58 next year to defend their title			1
against @entity36 @entity69 looks set to keep his place but @entity72 ’s time will come sooner rather than later			1
in front of the goalkeeper , @entity26 ’s defence tonight against @entity36 brings together @entity76 – enjoying his best season for several years – and @entity78			1
at full - back @entity81 right - back @entity79 will play on one side and @entity46 ’s @entity84 on the other side			0
all four are in the final stages of the @entity88 – something that is true of the entire expected xi. @entity3 has players playing regularly at the highest level for their clubs			2
@entity26 's players stand to attention during their training session in @entity98 @entity99 is set to retain his place in goal despite a string of mixed displays for club and country but @entity99 is coming under increased pressure at international level from @entity72 ( right ) ( left - right ) @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 in training for @entity26 in the centre of midfield he will pick two from the trio @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			2
the @entity81 pair could play together if @entity115 is still considered not to be 100 per cent having only returned from an ankle injury at the weekend			0
the three behind the striker are expected to be @entity45 , @entity121 and @entity122 , and in - form @entity123 striker @entity111 should lead the line			0
in the expected xi only @entity117 , @entity116 and @entity79 have not already won the @entity88			0
and the strength in depth is evident with @entity128 , @entity108 and @entity110 all pushing for a starting berth too			0
add to these names , those of the injured @entity132 , and long term absentees @entity133 , @entity135 and @entity136 , who will return as soon as they start playing for their clubs again and the squad still looks stronger than any other in @entity67 with the possible exception of the @entity143 – no wonder @entity3 is calling for optimism			1
if there is a problem it may be the lack of a prolific scorer in @entity132 ’s absence – with 13 goals @entity153 ’s @entity108 is this group ’s top scorer but the goals can come from anywhere including the back four , and there is even talk of @entity3 eventually recalling @entity158 so he can win the three remaining caps to take him to 100			2
@entity108 is currently @entity26 's top goal scorer at club level this season in the absence of @entity132 @entity26 forward @entity111 could lead the line on friday after his good form with @entity123 @entity78 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) in training at @entity167 's stadium @entity78 is set to feature in the game just over 10 years after he made his debut for @entity26 as an 18 - year - old @entity170 is to move to the top of the group currently led by @entity173 and to reignite the fire in the supporters who are still having nightmares about the defeat to @entity178 in @entity179			1
@entity26 have never lost at @entity167 ’s @entity33 in 24 games played there but on friday morning were still trying to sell the last 12,000 tickets of the 45,000 on sale for the game			1
the match will be especially important for defender @entity78 who goes back to his home city one day after he clocked up ten years since his first appearance for @entity26 in a friendly against @entity187 aged 18			2
in that decade , @entity26 have never lost a competitive home game			2
he was part of one golden generation – and wants to be part of another			1
steady evolution is @entity3 ’s watchword			0
‘ we kept a solid group of the players that brought us success in the past , ’ he said on thursday			0
‘ and we have new blood too			0
if we bring a player in , it ’s because we believe in him			0
it ’s not because we are experimenting ’ .			0

@entity26 face @entity36 in @entity44 qualifier on friday night in @entity34
@entity3 hoping to build a new golden generation
squad options *suggest* that @entity26 will be *contenders* in @entity58 next year
