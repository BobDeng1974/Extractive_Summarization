the @entity1 will review its rules about ivory imports after two @entity5 teenagers had their bagpipes seized at the @entity8 border , a spokesman said friday			1
the spokesman , @entity9 , said customs agents at the @entity11 , @entity12 , border crossing were following established laws designed to prevent the import and export of illegally harvested ivory when they seized the pipes			2
@entity18 and @entity19 , a pair of 17 - year - olds who compete on an international level , had their pipes taken			1
@entity18 's pipes date to 1936 and were played by his father ( @entity18 pictured ) @entity26 harvested since 1976 is banned in the @entity27 ' our headquarters is examining this and looking at the policy and the regulations understanding that musicians do have a unique situation , ' @entity9 said			1
' and we try to be reasonable , but for right now the rules are the rules			0
any instrument these days could be made from elephant parts that might not be an antique			0
' the discord started sunday when @entity18 and @entity19 were driving back from @entity8 after a competition that served as a tuneup for next weekend 's @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
@entity18 's pipes date to 1936 and were played by his father , @entity46 , who was the 9th @entity47 to queen elizabeth ii of england			1
@entity19 ( pictured ) also had his bagpipes confiscated at the @entity12 / @entity8 border because @entity11 is a ' nondesignated ' crossing , they needed extra permits and inspection fees totaling $ 576 to carry the pipes , with their ivory projecting mounts , across the border			1
they did n't have the paperwork and the pipes were confiscated for a day			2
the boys eventually got their pipes back and are in @entity43 , where their adventure has been the talk of the competition , @entity18 's mother , @entity62 , said friday			2
' it 's about time they think about ( amending the rules ) , ' she said			0
' we are not exporters			0
we are just carrying it on our person and playing music			0
' @entity9 said the added fees at nondesignated crossings are needed to recoup the expense of inspections at the border			0
he maintains that the musicians knew the rules beforehand , though @entity84 disputes that			0
there are no ' designated ' land crossings in the @entity88 ; the nearest designated crossing is @entity91 's @entity90 , meaning to avoid the extra fees and paperwork , they 'd have to fly to @entity8 .			2
