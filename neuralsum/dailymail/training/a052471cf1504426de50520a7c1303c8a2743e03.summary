by @entity0 for @entity1 dr @entity2 , who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient , has been cleared to work again without supervision a doctor who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient - leaving the woman unable to conceive naturally - is now free to return to work			1
the patient lost both her fallopian tubes within three days after dr @entity2 mistook a benign tumour for the ectopic pregnancy she was supposed to remove			1
the gynaecologist failed to see the patient before her operation , read her medical records or properly examine her during the procedure on september 21 , 2010			0
she then insisted she had removed the correct fallopian tube and sent the patient home despite the woman knowing something was desperately wrong			2
dr @entity23 was allowed to continue to work under conditions despite being found guilty of serious misconduct by a @entity26 ( @entity27 ) panel two years ago			1
the panel said the medic put her patient 's ' life at risk ' by discharging her with an untreated ectopic pregnancy , which later ruptured			1
an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg begins to develop outside of the womb , usually in the fallopian tubes			2
the pregnancy can cause life - threatening bleeding if left untreated			0
the patient - called patient a during the disciplinary proceedings - had to return to the @entity40 three days after the botched operation to have her other fallopian tube removed			2
a standards hearing in 2012 found the doctor had been ' hasty , careless , and dismissive ' before , during and after the procedure and her actions had ' undermined public confidence in the medical profession '			2
dr @entity23 was made subject to a string of conditions , which restricted her practise and kept her closely monitored by the @entity54			1
but those conditions have now been revoked , after the @entity27 found she is now fit to practise again			0
panel chair dr @entity57 said : ' it [ the panel ] considers that you have now accepted responsibility for your misconduct , both in relation to @entity64 and your relationships with colleagues , ' the panel has read the supportive testimonials from colleagues , who have noted marked improvements in your communication and collaboration , for example in taking advice when appropriate and that you have demonstrated insight into your behaviour and practice			0
dr @entity23 appeared before another standards panel earlier this month , which found she is now fit to practise he added : ' the panel now considers that the behavioural concerns arising from your misconduct have been remedied ; that you have demonstrated full insight into that misconduct and that you fully appreciate the impact of your behaviour on colleagues and the impact on @entity64 of your actions			1
' it considers that there is no risk of recurrence of similar misconduct			0
' furthermore , public confidence in the profession has been maintained and proper standards upheld in consequence of the restrictions on your practice that have applied for the last four years			0
' taking into account all the evidence , the @entity102 has determined that your fitness to practise is not currently impaired			0
' accordingly , the conditions imposed on your registration are revoked with immediate effect			0
' dr @entity23 is now free to return to work without restrictions .			1

dr @entity2 found to have been ' hasty and careless ' during operation
mistake at @entity40 left patient unable to conceive naturally
dr @entity23 even sent patient home with untreated ectopic pregnancy
she was ordered to work under strict conditions after hearing in 2012
