@entity1 ’s set - piece speech outlining @entity3 ’s pledge to tackle immigration lasted just 7 minutes and 43 seconds today – sparking fresh criticism that he was not taking the issue seriously			1
the @entity3 leader arrived in the key marginal seat of @entity9 this morning to unveil his election pledge to jail company bosses who exploit cheap foreign workers to undercut @entity14 wages			1
he also pledged to introduce ‘ proper ’ entry and exit checks , limit on in - work benefits for @entity19 migrants , and extend the period before which immigrants can claim out - of - work benefits to two years			0
labour leader @entity1 's set piece address on immigration lasted just 463 seconds today but his 463 - second address was overshadowed by a leaked party document telling party activists to ‘ move the conversation on ’ from immigration if voters bring it up on the doorstep			1
the paper , setting out plans to counter the challenge from @entity35 , was sent to dozens of mps in constituencies where @entity35 threatens to rob the opposition of the votes needed to return to power at next may 's general election			0
at the end of his speech on immigration mr @entity1 described the document as ‘ not very well drafted ’ but said there could be no suggestion he was seeking to dodge the issue			1
he said : ‘ i think what matters about our party is what i 'm saying on this stage - the pledge we 're making rather than some not very well drafted language in a briefing document			2
i do n't think anybody 's in any doubt where @entity3 stands on this			2
’ mr @entity1 added : ‘ we 're very clear about this , that 's why i 'm standing on this stage with our pledge on immigration			1
the @entity3 not only takes this seriously , but i 've changed @entity3 's approach			2
’ during his speech , mr @entity1 insisted : ‘ when people worry about the real impact immigration has , this @entity3 will always respond to those concerns , not dismiss them			1
‘ it is n't prejudiced to worry about immigration , it is understandable			0
’ during his speech , mr @entity1 insisted that @entity3 would respond to concerns about the ' real impact immigration ' mr @entity1 has a demonstration on how to mix paint by customer advisor @entity77 , as he meets staff at a @entity81 superstore in @entity9 mr @entity1 said he wants to end an ‘ epidemic of exploitation ’ which has led to ‘ truly shocking ’ examples of migrant workers having their wages withheld and being forced to live in appalling conditions			1
‘ when people can be exploited for low wages or endangered at work , it drags the whole system down , undercutting the pay and conditions of local workers , ’ said the @entity3 leader			1
‘ we must end the epidemic of exploitation			0
we must stop people 's living standards being undermined by scandalous undercutting			0
’ setting out his new proposals , he said : ‘ we are serving notice on employers who bring workers here under duress or on false terms and pay them significantly lower wages , with worse terms and conditions			0
‘ we will make it a criminal offence to undercut pay or conditions by exploiting migrant workers			1
’ aides said that bringing in foreign labour to undercut the pay and conditions of existing workers will not be sufficient , under @entity3 's plans , to secure a prosecution on its own , but it could be used as a piece of evidence of exploitation			1
mr @entity1 's speech was overshadowed by a leaked party document to secure a conviction , evidence will be needed that an abuse of power has occurred and that migrants were employed on significantly different terms to local workers			1
mr @entity1 said that , rather than the ‘ false promises ’ to bring down net immigration offered by the @entity133 or @entity35 's ‘ false solution ’ of quitting the @entity19 , @entity3 will seek to offer ‘ clear , credible and concrete solutions which help build a country that works for you ’			1
shadow home secretary @entity138 said she did not sign off the leaked document			2
ms @entity138 told @entity141 's @entity140 : ‘ i 'm afraid the document was wrong on this and it does n't reflect what we are actually doing			0
‘ what @entity1 is talking about today is making a pledge on immigration the second pledge that we are setting out for our manifesto for the campaign for the general election , because we know that the three things that people have most concerns about are around the economy , around immigration and around our @entity159			1
‘ i 'm not taking it too seriously and i do n't think you should take this document too seriously because it does n't reflect what we are actually doing			0
’ @entity3 mp @entity165 said he was ‘ concerned ’ about the document , telling @entity140 : ‘ i meet people on the doorstep and they talk about the @entity159 being under strain from immigration , they talk about housing and the pressure from immigration			1
in this part of the world , when people talk about crime , they sometimes mention trafficking , grooming gangs , sham marriages			0
this is the reality of it			0
‘ so you ca n't really shine a lot on your other policies without talking about immigration as well			0
’ last night a poll revealed strong public support for dramatic curbs on @entity19 migrant numbers			0
six out of ten people said they wanted a cap on the number of @entity194 nationals able to enter the @entity14			0
the poll also found opinion on the @entity19 appears to have become significantly more hostile , with 42 per cent wanting to leave compared to 31 per cent in favour of staying in			0
@entity133 mp @entity198 criticised mr @entity1 's seven minute address			2
he said : ' while it ’s true to say that @entity1 is all talk and no action – on some of the most important issues facing this country , clearly he prefers not to talk at all			2
' last week @entity1 gave us a speech on the deficit when he refused to be drawn on spending cuts			2
today he ’s offered a paltry 7mins 47 seconds on immigration			0
' yet again this reinforces that @entity1 is a weak leader with no grip over immigration and no long - term economic plan , putting the security of @entity14 people and their families at risk			2

@entity1 attacked company bosses who exploit migrant workers
if he wins election , he will propose making it a criminal offence
but his major immigration address before election lasted just 463 seconds
the speech also overshadowed by *row* over leaked @entity3 document
it tells *candidates* to ' move the conversation on ' if voters raise immigration
