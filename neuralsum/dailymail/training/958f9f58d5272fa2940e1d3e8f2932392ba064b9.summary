@entity1 manager @entity0 is considering bringing defender per mertesacker back from his @entity3 lay - off early as injury cover for tuesday 's @entity6 first leg play - off against @entity7			1
@entity8 and his @entity10 team - mates @entity11 and @entity12 were given the extended break by @entity0 after the @entity15 triumph in @entity16 last month with the trio scheduled to miss the first few weeks of the campaign			1
however , defenders @entity19 and @entity21 suffered knocks in saturday 's last - gasp 2 - 1 win over @entity24 meaning @entity8 , who last week announced his international retirement , could be drafted in to play in @entity26			1
' if he 's fit and capable to play , we play him			0
it was our plan to bring the @entity32 back for @entity33 ( on saturday )			0
but in case of emergency i will take @entity8			2
' ideally he would need one more week preparation but he 's willing to play , no problem			0
we are a bit short			0
' @entity40 @entity19 drew the @entity42 level on the stroke of half - time on saturday after @entity46 's glancing header gave @entity24 the lead at the @entity48			1
storming summer : @entity8 got his hands on the @entity15 as @entity10 triumphed in @entity16 @entity19 played the full 90 minutes but suffered from pain in his foot , while @entity21 lasted little over an hour before succumbing to a hamstring injury			1
@entity1 are aiming to reach the @entity6 group stage for the 17th consecutive season			2
after an impressive 3 - 0 @entity55 win over champions @entity56 and the victory over @entity24 , courtesy of @entity60 's late winner , @entity0 was confident of progressing past the @entity26 side			2
@entity62 lauds late @entity60 goal concern : @entity19 ( left ) was suffering from pain in his foot when @entity1 beat @entity24 this is how we do it : @entity0 takes training on monday before @entity1 head for @entity26 ' we are desperate to do it because we want to play in the @entity6 and we know how big these games are , ' he added			1
' we had to give a lot , hopefully we will recover and be ready for tuesday night			0
