by @entity0 from coffee to camomile : @entity4 concept watch releases smells to suit different times of day the idea of a watch constantly buzzing with reminders for appointments and workouts as well as texts and emails might prove stressful and unwelcome for some people			1
but now a concept for a different type of smartwatch promises to measure the passing of time in a number of scents , rather than beeps and buzzes			0
one computer expert has created a prototype watch that includes four dinky perfume bottles , which release fragrances associated with different times of the day			1
@entity26 , a physical computing lecturer at at the @entity28 , @entity29 , created the less - stressful smartwatch , which is designed to gently intensify the sense of time			1
the @entity4 watch is bulky as it features four perfume bottles as well as the mechanics to release the scents			1
it is intended to feature fragrances associated with waking up , relaxing , times of activity and sleeping			2
each of the four glass vials holds a millilitre of scent and every six hours the smartwatch releases a whiff of the perfume selected for the specific time of day , @entity41 reported			1
for example , a wearer could be woken up by the smell of freshly brewed coffee or a whiff of camomile to relax before falling asleep			2
the unconventional timepiece ( pictured ) does not show a clock face , but is is intended to feature fragrances associated with waking up , relaxing , times of activity and sleeping a wearer of the smartwatch could be woken up by the smell of freshly brewed coffee ( pictured ) or a whiff of camomile to relax before falling asleep the watch does not have a conventional clock face but instead emits suitable scents every six hours to draw the wearer 's attention to the passing of time			1
the design includes four vials of perfume associated with waking up , relaxing , activity and sleeping			2
it wafts scents periodically using piexoelectric atomisers that sit above each vial of perfume and emit a smell when they are triggered by the watch 's electronics			0
the atomisers vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies inaudible to the vast majority of humans , to convert a tiny amount of the scented liquid into vapour			0
the smartwatch ’s electronics are powered by a lithium - ion battery that can be charged using a @entity94 port and typically last 24 hours on a single charge			2
the watch is a concept and is not expected to go on sale in the near future			0

‘ @entity117 and chronoception are both chemical senses , so i thought it would be interesting to map them onto one another , ’ ms @entity26 said			0

it can be recharged using a @entity94 adapter ( also pictured ) each of the watch 's four glass vials holds a millilitre of scent and every six hours , it releases a whiff of the perfume selected for the specific time of day , which could be the smell of freshly brewed coffee ( pictured left ) in the morning or a whiff of camomile to relax before falling asleep ( right ) ‘ this device attempts to keep a chemical watch on the circadian rhythm [ the body ’s daily 24 hour cycle ] by administering fragrance and supplement concoctions associated with the daily activity of the moment to promote the production of certain neurotransmitters , such as chamomile and melatonin during sleep , espresso and caffeine during the awaken state , ’ she wrote on her website			1

different scents are designed to stimulate certain hormones at different times of day - for example , camomile perfume is designed to get a person ready for sleep the watch wafts the scent using piezoelectric atomisers ( pictured centre of the ' clock face ' ) which sit above each vial and emit a smell when they are triggered by the watch 's electronics			1
the smartwatch packs in plenty of technology but is designed to be less stressful than many smart wearable offerings			0

the prototype includes four dinky perfume bottles that release fragrances associated with different times of the day from coffee to camomile
