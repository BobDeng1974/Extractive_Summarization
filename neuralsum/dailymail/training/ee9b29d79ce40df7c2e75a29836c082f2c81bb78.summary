by @entity0 published : 19:12 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 06:31 est , 5 january 2014 from the end of @entity5 through the 1960s , @entity3 's @entity2 was the epicenter of celebrity society			1
the night club in @entity10 was founded by ex-bootlegger @entity11 , who kept his famous customers happy with good service - communicating to his wait staff through a secret language of hand signals that ranged from ' no need to pay attention to these folks ' to ' bring a bottle of champagne '			1
@entity11 revealed his secret code in 1944 , and life recently republished the set of the pictures			1
perhaps the most surprising hand signal is a simple thumbs up , which meant ' get them out and do n't let them in again '			2
secret language : life recently republished @entity2 owner @entity11 's secret hand signal codes that he used in the legendary @entity3 club			1
a thumbs up was not a good signal for a customer receive			0
it meant ' get them out and do n't let them in again ' that 's a hand signal @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 probably all saw when they visited the legendary club , as all four were eventually banned			2
but most of the secret signals were good signs , and usually meant a treat for whatever customer @entity11 was chatting up that night			2
if he adjusted his tie , it meant the table would n't be seeing a check - @entity11 was footing the bill			0
when he grabbed his pocket square , a server somewhere was sent to fetch a $ 200 bottle of perfume as a gift			0
' the music in the main dining room is too loud ' : some of @entity11 's hand signals were purely for the servers and not comments about the people he was talking to spoiler : @entity66 often showered his customers with gifts from free rounds of drinks ( hand signal left ) to $ 200 bottles of perfume ( hand signal right ) and more gifts : when he adjusted his tie , it meant he was paying the tables check			1
and a laid out hand on the table it meant to bring a complimentary bottle of champagne @entity11 was notorious for his generosity , and customers often left with anything from a gold compact to cigar clippers			0
other than getting the boot , the only bad hand signals were the ones labeling customers as bores			0
when he scratched his nose it meant the table he was talking to had no important people at it			0
and if he made a cuffing hand over his ear , he wanted a server to pretend he had a call so he could leave			0
@entity103 : scratching his nose meant the table he was talking to was n't important ( left ) and cuffing his hand to his ear meant someone needed to pretend he had a call so he could politely excuse himself from the table ( right ) but with clientele like @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113 , it 's hard to imagine @entity11 used those hand signals very often			1
the @entity2 was torn down in 1965 , and today a park sits in its place			0
but @entity11 's secret language of hand signals lived on even after his club 's death and continues to be used in fine - dining restaurants across the nation .			1

the @entity2 was an *upscale* @entity124 club located in @entity10 from the end of @entity5 to 1965
in its heydey , the club owned by ex-bootlegger @entity11 *attracted* clients like @entity111 , @entity130 and @entity113
@entity11 created a secret hand signal to communicate with wait staff at his club without *attracting* the attention of his guests
he *shared* these signals with life in 1944 , and they are now being republished
