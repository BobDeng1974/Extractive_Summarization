by @entity0 published : 17:17 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 17 october 2013 paedophiles could find it easier to prey on teenagers online after @entity4 changed its rules to allow under - 18s to share pictures with anyone on the internet			1
until now , all @entity4 users aged between 13 and 17 have been barred from making their posts visible to all users			1
they have been restricted to those they had already decided to link with on the social networking site and were allowed to share posts only with ‘ friends of friends ’			0
but , following what it claims are demands from teenagers themselves , that protection has been removed and @entity4 will allow children to share their images and videos with the entire public			1
' disaster ' : campaigners have condemned the move by @entity4			1
they say it will lead to pictures of teens ending up in the wrong hands			0
picture posed by a model the move has been condemned as a ‘ disaster ’ by campaigners , who warn that explicit self - portraits taken by youngsters could fall into the wrong hands			1
the change brings @entity4 in line with other social networks such as @entity46 , which allows all users to post publicly			1
another change means teenage users will be given a default setting of ‘ friends only ’ – meaning that to post publicly they will have to change the setting themselves			1
technically , @entity4 is open only to those aged 13 and above , but in fact thousands of children younger than that have become members of the site by lying about their age			1
@entity4 does not carry out an age verification check			2
it means that thousands of children under 13 could also be at risk of seeing their photos fall into the hands of paedophiles			0
@entity67 , @entity68 ’s media spokesman , said @entity4 ’s change of policy would be a ‘ disaster ’ for teenagers			1
‘ this is a very foolish development , ’ she said			0
‘ many young people do not understand that photographs which can be put into the public domain can be taken and used by paedophiles			0
‘ and we know from experience that young people are groomed and bullied on social media , sometimes with tragic consequences			0
i ’m just appalled about this and i really do urge @entity4 to think again before we have any more tragic episodes			2
’ @entity85 , of the @entity86 , said the charity was pleased that @entity4 has made ‘ friends only ’ the default setting for 13 - to 17 - year - olds , but she attacked the decision to allow them to share posts publicly			1
no age check : @entity4 does n't carry out an age verification check ‘ it ’s simply not acceptable for @entity4 to expect children to take 100 per cent responsibility for managing not just their settings but their levels of risk too ; teenagers are n’t always going to be careful about what they post , ’ she said			2
earlier this week , the @entity105 revealed that tens of thousands of explicit pictures shared by teenagers are stolen and end up on websites viewed by paedophiles			0
a search of only 40 hours by analysts at the @entity111 , which takes down child abuse images , found more than 12,200 self - generated pictures and videos of teens on paedophile websites			2
a survey by the charity @entity118 has found that more than half of teens have been pressurised into sharing intimate photos , either via their mobiles or on sites such as @entity4 , @entity123 or @entity124			2
@entity125 , director of policy for @entity4 in the @entity127 , said : ‘ one of the requests we hear direct from teenagers most often is the ability to share things in a public way , just as they can on other services			2
‘ teens are among the savviest people using social media , and they want to be heard			0
’ he said the changes were designed to ‘ improve the experience ’ for teenagers			0
‘ they ’re expert at controlling who can see what they say and do on @entity4 , ’ he said			0
as a protective measure , @entity4 will warn minors opting to be more open that they are exposing themselves to a wider audience			0
this will repeat before every post , while the settings remain on ‘ public ’			0
@entity155 , professor of communications at the @entity156 in @entity157 , criticised what she described as a money - making move by @entity4			1
she said that allowing teenagers to share more about themselves will enable advertisers to collect more personal data about them			0
@entity4 denied the move would enable it to make more money .			1

until now 13 to 17 - year olds barred from making posts visible to all users
but @entity4 removed that protection and images can be shared publicly
move condemned as a ' disaster ' by campaigners
