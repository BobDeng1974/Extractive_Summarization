@entity1 's flagship energy price freeze was in further chaos last night as @entity3 was forced to re-launch it as a drive to cut fuel costs			1
his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months was left in turmoil earlier this year by tumbling wholesale prices			2
today , the @entity1 leader will announce that he would pass a law to force the regulator @entity13 to push prices down by up to £ 100 this winter			1
his officials are now drafting legislation to allow @entity13 to ‘ put an immediate end to the overcharging by the @entity31 energy firms ’ which costs families and business around £ 2.5billion a year			1
@entity1 was forced to ‘ rebrand ’ the proposed freeze as a price cap when power companies started reducing household fuel bills earlier this year in response to falling wholesale costs			1
the party had to issue a ‘ clarification ’ that they would also allow household energy bills to fall and they would not be frozen at a higher level than necessary			2
mr @entity3 had been criticised for intervening in the market and the industry warned it would put investment in jeopardy			0
the @entity48 have pointed out that if energy prices had been frozen when mr @entity3 announced the policy , it would have meant families paying bills £ 100 higher than necessary today			1
if @entity3 had frozen gas prices when he announced his policy back in 2013 , households would now be paying £ 100 more than necessary after falling wholesale prices drove down bills opponents of mr @entity3 say this mistake reveals the danger of meddling in a free market , and warn that any further intervention could risk investment and jobs last night energy minister @entity65 said : ‘ this is now the sixth version of a chaotic @entity1 energy policy that would have put up families ’ bills by £ 100 and could do the same again – their record at setting prices has been a disaster			1
‘ and only @entity3 could propose giving a new power to a regulator he plans to scrap			1
this incompetence is exactly why @entity3 is n’t up to the job			0
hardworking taxpayers would pay the price with higher bills			0
’ mr @entity3 will say today that in one of his first bills of the next @entity83 , he would give @entity13 ‘ a legal duty to review prices by the autumn – and the power to order price reductions in time for the winter ’			1
he will accuse the conservatives of failing to stand up to ‘ vested interests ’			0
‘ we live in a country where you ca n’t fulfil one of the foundations of family life – keeping your home warm – without being overcharged by one of the big energy firms ’ , he will say			0
‘ it ’s been 18 months since i announced the next @entity1 government would freeze energy bills – so they can only go down and not up – until 2017 while we reset this broken market			2
’ @entity1 says prices are tumbling ‘ not because of anything the government or the @entity31 energy firms have done , but because of global changes in oil and gas supply ’			2
@entity1 is set to hand the key marginal seat of @entity112 to @entity113 , who was at the centre of the @entity116 vote - rigging row			0
the party suspended her in 2013 over allegations the @entity121 union tried to manipulate the selection process in her favour			0
she was later cleared .			0

@entity3 had promised to freeze gas and electricity bills back in 2013
falling prices mean freeze would have made households £ 100 worse off
now says he will get @entity13 to force energy companies to drop prices
however opponents point out that he promised to scrap the regulator
