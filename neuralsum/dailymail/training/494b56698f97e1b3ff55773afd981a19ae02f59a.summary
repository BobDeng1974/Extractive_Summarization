by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 they say @entity4 ’s defeat by @entity5 was the best thing that could have happened , exposing their shortcomings before it is too late to act			0
perhaps the same theory can be applied to @entity9			0
for while their 2 - 0 loss to champions @entity13 was rich in spirit , skill , endeavour and enthusiasm , it was nonetheless lacking one key ingredient — a shot on target			1
indeed , they were the only top - flight team not to trouble an opposition goalkeeper during the opening weekend			2
@entity23 : £ 6million signing @entity24 failed to get his name on the scoresheet at @entity27 under pressure : @entity29 , left , found his way blocked by the formidable figure of @entity32 the @entity33 failed to score in 13 of their final 21 matches last season and the suspicion is that an impotent offence could undermine their progress this time around			1
final balls were wayward — shooting likewise — and , for all their attacking intent , they lacked the penalty - box instinct of a @entity43 or @entity44 , the players who ultimately settled this affair			2
‘ i did n’t feel @entity9 had clear chances to score except in the last two minutes of the game , ’ said the @entity48 , referencing @entity29 ’s goal - bound shot deflected wide by a sliding @entity51			2
@entity56 ’s @entity55 tenure has been defined by goalscorers : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and , last season , @entity62			1
@entity24 — a £ 6m signing from @entity63 — is the man charged with filling his boots — and the net — this season			1
comeback trail : @entity69 playmaker @entity68 should help @entity9 get firing on all cylinders but @entity56 feels goals reside in other areas of the squad , even if some of those players remain in the treatment room			1
‘ we ’re still missing @entity60 ( @entity79 ) and @entity68 , two massive players for us that we ’ve paid a financial outlay on , ’ he said , when asked if he would be re-entering the transfer market			1
‘ they ’re big players			0
so no , i feel once they ’re in and around the squad we ’ll score goals			0
impressive : @entity85 in possession during a promising display against the @entity89 champions ‘ we were playing the champions today and sometimes you do n’t get any shots against the champions			0
but i thought we had a really good go			0
’ playmaker @entity85 was the pick of @entity56 ’s five debutants and the manager likened him to @entity13 ’s @entity43			1
but every @entity85 needs a goalscorer to exploit his cunning			2
and to that end @entity9 remain short			0
@entity56 has until september 1 to do something about it .			0

@entity24 and @entity29 failed to trouble @entity13
@entity68 and @entity60 are short of match *fitness* at start of season
new signing @entity85 performed well for the @entity33 and @entity56 likened him to @entity13 goalscorer @entity43
@entity13 won 2 - 0 at @entity27 to start their title defence *strongly*
