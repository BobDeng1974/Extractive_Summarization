the game at the very top level is fast approaching an age whereby prudence pays			1
although there is a deal of scepticism as to whether @entity8 can fully enforce their stringent @entity9 rules , there is a definite sea change afoot			1
with that in mind , the rise in pre-contract agreements could be a steep one in the coming years			2
free transfers are nothing new - and do cost clubs hefty amounts in inflated sign - on fees - with some managers hoping to get business done early			2
and in truth , those in the @entity23 are planning for next august now			2
there are a raft of players from across the world who are available to sign ahead of the 2015 - 16 season ; scouts up and down the country try to remain two steps ahead - forever looking two transfer windows in front of themselves			2
if they ’re not looking , others certainly are			2
@entity39 's @entity38 winner @entity37 is one of a raft of players potentially available on a pre-contract @entity43 will already be on the hunt for new faces to help strengthen his @entity47 squad simply put , a club can talk to any player who plies his trade in another country out of contract in june 2015 from @entity53 about signing at the end of this season			1
they can put pen to paper on a deal , with a target committing to a contract before his current one expires			2
@entity65 , for example , is available should @entity66 feel the need for another right back , but @entity69 - also a free agent in seven months - is off limits to domestic rivals for now			1
so , who could they be scouting as we count down to january ? @entity76 takes a look at the available stars on pre-contract agreements in two months ’ time - firstly in an xi format , and then with a collection of notable others			2
@entity83 ( @entity84 ) interest : @entity85 , @entity47 the man who saved two @entity88 penalties in the @entity38 semi-final could well be leaving @entity90 at the end of this season			2
@entity94 's stopper - who was shortlisted for the @entity95 in @entity96 - would be very handy for most sides			1
one wonders whether @entity43 fancies deploying someone down at @entity99			2
@entity83 was @entity94 's goalkeeper during the @entity100 and plays for @entity90 's @entity84 the 28 - year - old dives to his right as he thwarts @entity88 's @entity103 in the @entity38 semi-fina shootout @entity65 ( @entity105 ) has already made it clear that he wo n’t be staying at the @entity107 beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in @entity8			1
a veteran of the @entity113 but still with the vibrancy a full back in @entity116 requires , the @entity111 will have many suitors			0
@entity118 ( @entity119 ) interest : @entity85 , @entity120 whether the @entity119 ’s skipper pens new terms in @entity123 remains to be seen - it certainly is n’t beyond the realm of possibility - but the central defender will have a few in his ear			0
with @entity119 having won the last three titles - a fourth appears to be on its way - @entity118 may fancy a change , particularly given he ’s only played in @entity90 @entity65 has already made it clear that he wo n't be staying at @entity105 beyond his current deal right back @entity65 has 79 caps for @entity96 and formed part of the back four at the @entity107 for the last six years @entity137 central defender @entity136 was partly responsible for @entity138 's dismal night in @entity139 @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity69 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 @entity136 ( @entity159 ) interest : @entity160 one of the emerging central defenders in @entity8 and with designs of bigger things			1
excellent against @entity47 in the continent ’s premier competition only a matter of weeks ago and has plenty of admirers			0
only 22 so would require a compensation fee to be paid , but that would come out at less than @entity137 ’s asking price otherwise			0
@entity172 ( @entity173 ) interest : @entity174 @entity175 ’s chosen left back during the summer @entity38 , @entity172 was the man to continue playing despite a heavy clash with @entity178 in @entity116 ’s group stage defeat			0
@entity175 's @entity172 played on despite suffering after a heavy clash with @entity178 in @entity96 the full back ( pictured playing for @entity173 in october ) loves to gallop forward from his defensive station @entity37 ( @entity183 ) interest : @entity160 , @entity66 , @entity120 the real standout player available to clubs who want to get their business done swiftly			1
it ’s no secret as to @entity37 ’s obvious ability - with @entity160 interested in the central midfielder - and , although his wages will undoubtedly be high , not many would pass up the opportunity to add the @entity193			0
@entity194 ( @entity195 ) interest : @entity160 , @entity85 perhaps someone who will peak the interest of those beneath the top six in the @entity23 , @entity194 is a classy midfielder on the ball but also has a height advantage over most			0
those attributes - plus possessing an excellent engine - make the @entity204 desirable			0
@entity37 is out of contract at @entity183 this summer and is wanted by a host of clubs , including @entity160 the central midfielder ( battling with @entity209 in october ) has been linked with a move away @entity194 ( pictured celebrating while playing for @entity211 against @entity39 ) has all the attributes @entity213 ( @entity214 ) interest : @entity47 , @entity174 @entity47 failed to sign the winger last january because @entity214 dug their heels in , but the @entity218 side must be regretting that now			0
interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free			1
it ’s a matter of who gets there first			0
@entity224 ( @entity225 ) interest : @entity47 , @entity226 always one who is talked about when a window comes around , and january will be no different			1
@entity225 wo n’t see any value in taking the money and running , so it ’ll be interesting to see who courts the @entity234 livewire			0
@entity213 ( left , against @entity116 's @entity235 in 2013 ) almost joined @entity47 last january @entity225 's @entity234 @entity224 ( right ) is consistently linked with moves to @entity23 teams @entity238 is on loan at @entity240 from @entity242 's @entity241 in @entity90 the @entity243 has impressed for @entity245 's side this season , notably against @entity47 at @entity247 @entity238 ( @entity241 , on loan at @entity240 ) interest : @entity240 , @entity160 is @entity240 merely a shop window for the @entity243 ? perhaps , perhaps not			1
@entity245 will be well aware @entity238 is out of contract and - should @entity240 have designs of consolidating in the @entity23 , they could do a lot worse than to get this one sorted			1
the one thing that may work against them is question marks over which division they ’ll be in next year			0
@entity259 ( @entity260 ) interest : @entity160 , @entity174 , @entity47 simply put , the striker can not stop scoring			1
it ’s nine ( yes , nine ) goals in the @entity113 already , including five away at @entity264			0
he is a late developer and an unknown commodity but had a hand in two on his @entity96 debut against @entity269 on wednesday night			1
@entity259 had a hand in two @entity96 goals against @entity269 during an impressive debut on wednesday night the @entity274 striker ca n't stop scoring in the @entity113 - he has nine already this term @entity276 ( @entity277 ) at 35 , the goalkeeper - with 114 caps for @entity280 before retiring from international football - may be looking for one last move before he calls it a day for good			1
would surely only act as a no 2 , but definitely someone who could act as reliable cover			0
@entity287 ( @entity288 ) looking for that little bit of added steel in midfield ? @entity287 may well be your man			0
a fierce competitor and someone who @entity120 have missed a touch this season			0
@entity297 ( @entity298 ) bombs forward from right back and one of the more exuberant fliers to watch in @entity8			0
@entity297 ( in action for @entity298 against @entity302 ) is lightning and exciting to watch on the right @entity305 ( @entity288 ) played in @entity307 's back four during the @entity38 and did so impressively			1
a good age at 28			0
@entity309 ( @entity310 ) has never scored enough goals given his position and the quality he has , but would still provide @entity314 to a range of sides			0
@entity317 ( @entity225 ) not keen on signing a new deal , with the striker - linked with @entity160 and @entity320 - seemingly on his way			1
@entity317 ( pictured training with @entity323 on tuesday ) is unlikely to stay at @entity225 like @entity325 's facebook page .			1

@entity105 's @entity65 has said he is ready to leave the @entity107
striker @entity259 made his @entity96 debut on wednesday
@entity224 and @entity238 also potentially available
