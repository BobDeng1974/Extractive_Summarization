if @entity1 is to be believed , @entity0 will be a household name in the near future — yet what is publicly known about the @entity5 would n’t fill the back of a score card			1
‘ @entity15 ’ does n’t come close to describing the 24 - year - old , who is originally from @entity10 but is such a man of mystery that nobody apart from himself knows for sure where he now resides			1
reportedly , over the past year , he has based himself in @entity16 ( to avoid punitive @entity5 taxes ) , @entity18 , @entity19 and elsewhere			0
the @entity20 says he is a resident on @entity21 in south - east @entity5			0
the man himself will not say			0

one thing is certain : the @entity34 rookie is some player , underlined by the skills he displayed in two wins from the two fourballs matches he has played alongside @entity1 here			2

@entity0 ’s father was reportedly a banker			0
one of @entity5 ’s most famous basketball players , @entity58 , is supposedly his uncle			0

the late @entity90 ’s son @entity89 tweeted earlier this year : ‘ @entity0 is my new hero			1
’ @entity91 says he is a friendly guy but ‘ it is very difficult to know what to make of @entity0 ’			2
