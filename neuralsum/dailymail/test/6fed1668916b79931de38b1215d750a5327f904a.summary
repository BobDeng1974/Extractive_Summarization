eight years ago , after his @entity2 team had beaten @entity3 to win the @entity5 final in @entity6 , @entity0 knelt in the centre circle , spread his arms out wide , tilted his head back and turned his eyes to the skies in a gesture of worship and supplication			1
the @entity16 superstar was wearing a vest on which he had printed the proud statement ' i belong to @entity20 '			1
it was a striking , bold image of a man not afraid to display his faith			2
please correct me if i 'm wrong but i ca n't remember anybody screaming that what @entity0 had done was a ' disgrace '			1
i ca n't remember him being mocked or ridiculed			2
i ca n't remember anyone saying his gesture was an affront to public decency			2
@entity0 showed off an ' i belong to @entity20 ' vest after @entity2 's @entity5 win against @entity3 in 2007 the @entity16 midfielder , who is deeply religious , was not mocked or ridiculed for the message on his clothes i ca n't remember public anger being mobilised against him or him being held up as a symbol of a creeping , sinister malaise in our society			1
i ca n't remember @entity0 being criticised for his faith			1
i ca n't remember anyone saying that such shows of religious devotion were out of place at a football match			2
last monday night , i went to an @entity51 game at @entity52			2
as always before a sporting event of any size in the @entity56 , professional or high school , the crowd sang the national anthem lustily			2
i might not have been paying attention but i do n't recall anybody objecting when the spectators sang @entity62			2
i do n't recall anybody saying they were inflicting their religion on the @entity66 among the crowd			1
the idea that anybody might do that is absurd , right ? i mean , amid all the other things we have to worry and fret about , who could object to something as harmless as that ? and what about the high profile @entity78 that exists on golf 's @entity79 and boasts major winners such as @entity82 and @entity83 among its members ? some members pause midway through their rounds to read from the @entity87 , meditate on holy scriptures and pray			1
' we do something before every round , ' @entity90 golfer @entity89 said recently			2
two - time masters champion @entity82 is part of a @entity78 on the @entity79 @entity83 , pictured in action at the @entity97 heritage , is another well known @entity98 golfer nobody sees fit to complain about that , surely			1
imagine the outrage if they did			2
whether you follow the same beliefs or not , why would anybody object to sportsmen finding some common ground in religion ? it 's the same in the @entity110			1
players routinely congregate on the pitch before and after a match to pray			2
not even something to remark upon			2
just part of players ' rituals			1
members of the @entity120 , who won the @entity122 two years ago , even made a proselytising video extolling the virtues of @entity125 and urging supporters to ' find out how you can get plugged in with local believers '			0
and let 's not forget our own @entity131			1
some might see it as a refuge of the godless but many of its players do n't agree			0
@entity137 , the @entity3 forward , talks openly about giving the glory for his deeds to @entity140			1
his beliefs are widely seen as a positive element in his life			0
@entity144 always dropped to his knees to pray before kick off when he played for @entity146			0
@entity147 , the former @entity148 defender , used to drive to training with a ' @entity150 is life ' sticker on his van when he was at @entity154			0
@entity137 ( left ) and @entity144 ( right ) both express their beliefs on the football pitch so forgive me for being naive but why is it that when two men pray quietly in a small corner of an @entity165 football ground that their actions should be labelled a ' disgrace '			0
the only disgrace , of course , was the blinkered , bigoted reaction of the petty - minded oaf who took the picture of the men and was appalled by what he saw			0
what exactly is noteworthy about two men praying on the concourse at @entity178 during @entity3 's @entity179 tie with @entity180 last month ? why is it that when another group of supporters did the same thing at a @entity187 match recently , their actions were met with similar consternation ? you probably remember the video footage of that incident at @entity192			1
a breathless man shouting ' what is this ' as he filmed the men praying as if they were engaged in an act of desecration			1
then the supporters around him started yelling ' @entity199 , @entity199 ' as if they had located a rival hooligan faction			0
@entity201 took this photograph of @entity203 and @entity204 praying at @entity178 last month let 's be honest about this because there 's a simple answer to the question of what unites these reactions : if you 're @entity98 , it 's ok to pray at a football ground			1
if you 're @entity216 , it 's not			1
that 's the truth , is n't it ? that 's what we 're avoiding			1
expressions of @entity98 devotion at sporting events go unremarked			0
expressions of @entity216 devotion are described as ' extraordinary scenes '			1
they prompt suggestions that this will be the thin end of the wedge and that soon , horror of horrors , there will be prayer rooms at football stadia			0
@entity237 , well , what 's wrong with that ? some clubs already have prayer rooms , actually			1
it is bizarre that anyone should even consider it an issue			0
but they do , apparently			0
religion at a sporting event becomes a topic only when it is someone else 's religion			1
@entity252 sang about that once			0
the verse went like this : ' you do n't count the dead when @entity140 's on your side			1
' failure to end @entity261 debate is hurting @entity262 it 's a sorry state of affairs when @entity262 's inability to close out the @entity265 against the @entity266 is seen through the prism of another failure to quell speculation about the return of @entity261			1
@entity271 would have quietened some of the voices that have been urging his restoration to the side			0
defeat would have hastened his recall			0
the draw in @entity279 was the worst of all worlds			0
@entity282 leads the way as @entity262 's players trudge off after their draw against the @entity266 there is an unavoidable sense that @entity165 cricket will not be able to move on until the @entity261 issue is resolved and an inconclusive series in the @entity291 will mean only that our game is more likely to be left in a state of limbo until the @entity297 series this summer and possibly beyond			2
it almost feels as if it would be better to throw @entity261 into the fray and step back and watch the fisticuffs			0
there is a storm coming and until it breaks , we fret about the dark clouds			0
talk of an @entity262 return for batsman @entity261 is continuing to gather pace former @entity309 tight end @entity308 was convicted of first degree murder last week for shooting a man six times			0
he was sentenced to life in prison without parole			0
the jury heard that @entity144 , one of the best players in the @entity110 , thought that wealth and fame made him immune from the rule of law			0
his demise is a grim warning of the worst that can happen when the inflated wages modern sportsmen earn warp their minds			0
former @entity327 star @entity308 ( second from right ) has been sentenced to life in prison without parole favourite food at a sporting venue ? the @entity335 cakes they used to serve at @entity178 take some beating but the garlic fries they serve at @entity52 in @entity340 went to the top of my list this week			1
the game — the @entity51 beat the @entity345 in extra innings — was n't bad , either			0
@entity51 duo @entity347 ( left ) and @entity348 celebrate after beating the @entity345			0

@entity3 are taking action against *fan* @entity201 who photographed @entity203 and @entity204 praying at @entity178 last month
@entity201 *captioned* the photo : ' @entity216 praying at half time @entity353 '
@entity0 famously displayed a ' i belong to @entity20 ' vest after @entity2 's @entity5 win against @entity3 in 2007
@entity82 and @entity83 are part of a @entity361
