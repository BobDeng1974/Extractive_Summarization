the event will be held at the @entity34 for the @entity35 at @entity34 in @entity36 , the same location where @entity38 introduced the original @entity39 30 years ago			1

' @entity0 plans to unveil a new wearable alongside the two next - generation @entity56 we told you the company will debut on september 9 , ' @entity40 said			1
@entity0 has already built a mysterious large structure at the site of the unveiling - believed to be where the press will get their first chance to try the firm 's new @entity9 and @entity10 @entity0 has already hinted at the wearable in the latest update to its @entity69 software , which includes health tracking capabilities			1

' it will also — predictably — make good use of @entity79 , the company ’s new framework for controlling connected devices — though it ’s not clear how broadly or in what way			2
' earlier this month one analyst claimed @entity0 's @entity10 had been delayed and will not go on sale until 2015			1
@entity87 securities analyst @entity86 says difficulties with manufacturing the new device will likely be the cause of the delay , according to 9to5mac			2
reports have previously claimed @entity0 's @entity10 could double up as an activity tracker			1
this concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look			1
dubbed the @entity97 , it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate			2
it could launch at an event in october , alongside @entity0 's next @entity104 range ' we reiterate our view that @entity10 , as compared to existing products , and as @entity0 ’s ( @entity19 ) first attempt at a wearable device , represents a much higher level of difficulty for the company as regards component and system design , manufacturing and integration between hardware and software , he said			1
' while we are positive on @entity10 and believe that the advantages of the design and business model behind it are difficult to copy , we think , given the aforementioned challenges , that the launch could be postponed to 2015			1
' a leading @entity127 blog says the @entity9 will be announced on tues 9 sept. the information comes from supposedly leaked box art of the device ( left )			2

the @entity10 will be the closest the @entity19 company has come to selling a fashion accessory and marks its first foray into the personal luxury goods @entity153 is in a race against @entity155 and @entity156 to turn computers into wearable fashion and must - have items as smartphones , increasingly becoming commoditized items , start losing their appeal			1
@entity0 has plucked several executives from the luxury sector in recent months			0
@entity165 executive @entity165 started as its new head of retail and online sales in may , and former head of @entity127 fashion brand @entity171 @entity170 was hired last year to work on special projects			0

' i do n’t believe that an @entity10 will be a threat to luxury @entity141 watches , ' said @entity224 , analyst at @entity225 in @entity226			0
' but where i do see some potential impact is at lower , for example below $ 1,000 , price points where there could be a temporary dislocation if there is super high demand for @entity235			0
' @entity236 , head of watch brands at @entity144 and chairman of watch brand @entity239 , said he believed the threat of smart watches had to be taken seriously by the @entity141 watch industry			0
' the @entity10 will have the same status symbol power as many other @entity0 products , especially at the beginning , ' he said			0
