by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 could never have imagined what was ahead of him when he lifted the @entity6 urn at @entity7 this time last year , but the @entity10 captain now has the opportunity to consign 12 months of near total misery to history			1
a win for @entity3 ’s ‘ new ’ side in the final @entity16 would not only complete a series victory over @entity18 but would draw a line under the recriminations which accompanied the unravelling of one of the most successful of all @entity10 teams			1
the famous old south @entity25 ground is a worthy venue for @entity3 , the highest profile survivor of the @entity29 whitewash fall - out , to attempt to silence any remaining doubts that he truly is the best man to take @entity10 forward			1
@entity18 ( probable ) : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( capt / wkt ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58			1
umpires : @entity60 ( @entity61 ) and @entity62 ( @entity63 )			2
tv umpire : @entity65 ( @entity66 )			2
match referee : @entity68 ( @entity61 )			2
pitch : looked a bit greener than usual yesterday and @entity10 hope it has more pace and carry than last year			2
@entity72 : live on @entity73 from 10am and on @entity74 from 10.25am			2
weather : @entity25 looks set to be dry , but possibly cloudy , for the bulk of the @entity77			0
not only has @entity3 twice been part of an @entity6 - clinching side at @entity7 but it was here that he saved his @entity10 skin with a century against @entity83 four years ago during what was , before now , the toughest time of his career			1
‘ we were running around the ground this morning and @entity46 said to me , “ it does n’t seem a year ago we were lifting the @entity6 here ” , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i said , “ it might not to you but it does to me ! ” ‘ a lot has happened over the past year and i guess the beauty of sport is that you never know what ’s going to happen next			2
‘ we ’ve made a big stride forward over the last couple of weeks and this is another little challenge now			0
how do we cope when we ’re up in the series ? can we finish the job ? i hope the next year is a lot more successful and less eventful ! ’ there are certainly real signs of progress for @entity10 , through the form of the likes of @entity41 , @entity39 and @entity108 , but it is one of the senior core of players who have finally come to the fore in the last two thumping victories who is poised to hog the limelight over the next five days			1
@entity47 stands seven short of sir @entity118 ’s record as @entity10 ’s leading @entity16 wicket - taker and @entity3 paid tribute to the leader of his attack while remembering the uncertain start of their relationship			0
‘ if he breaks the record here it will probably mean @entity10 are in a very strong position , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ it ’s an amazing achievement for the most skilful bowler in the world			0
all smiles : @entity3 has been questioned but is re-finding form in both his batting and captaincy video captain cook focused on series win mean machine : @entity47 is on the cusp of becoming @entity10 's all - time leading @entity141 taker long time ago : @entity10 do n't appear to be missing the sacked @entity142 this summer ‘ you saw his guts and determination last week when he was bowling so well at @entity146 despite being ill. that tells me what sort of bloke he is and to back that up with talent and skill makes him a very fine bowler			1
’ the pair are firm friends but it was not that way when they first met			0
‘ i played against @entity159 against @entity160 and he called me all the names under the sun , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ then we went on an a tour of @entity166 together and we never spoke			0
we both got called up by @entity10 to go to @entity18 and i thought , “ this is going to be an interesting 48 hours ”			1
but we talked on the plane and now we ’re good friends			0
what amazes me is how he keeps trying to improve			0
’ if all eyes will be on @entity47 and @entity46 — who will play with either a splint or a mask protecting his broken nose — then there will be three other @entity10 players with much to prove against what looks a deflated @entity18			1
this is a huge game for @entity38 who , since hitting a century against @entity179 in his second test , has struggled outside off stump and it is conceivably his last chance to prove he should open against his native @entity29 next year			1
‘ it is vitally important we get a settled partnership at the top of the order , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ @entity187 has had a tough couple of games but that can happen when you open			0
‘ this is a hurdle he has to get over and i ’ve no doubt he can do it			0
he has to back his ability to score runs and prove himself as an international performer			0
’ the stakes are almost as high for @entity44 and @entity199 , who both seem certain to keep their places ahead of @entity203 and @entity204 despite failing to convince in this series that they are the right back - up to the big two			2
yet @entity10 ’s problems suddenly seem so much smaller than those of @entity18 , who have fallen apart and lost focus so spectacularly over the last two tests in @entity213 and @entity214 after winning so impressively at @entity215			1
man on a mission : @entity47 has been @entity10 's key man in recent tests as they recorded two wins @entity57 , who destroyed @entity10 with seven wickets on that last , turbulent day at @entity215 , is fit to return , which should give @entity18 a boost , but whether captain @entity53 is in the mood to capitalise on it remains in doubt			1
@entity53 ’s captaincy and performance on the last day at @entity146 were little short of bizarre and , incredibly , he decided to have a day off on wednesday , apparently to indulge his hobby of shooting , rather than practise with the rest of his side			1
it is the sort of behaviour that would lead to castigation if he were @entity10 captain			0
‘ i felt like having a day off and took one , ’ said a dismissive @entity53			1
i was with the team for the three days after @entity146 and we had enough team - building activities			0
one more day wo n’t make any difference			0
’ it is an arrogant attitude which should help @entity10 ’s attempt to seal a series win here that would mean the world to them and vindicate their own captain			1
not bothered ? @entity53 did n't even bother to train with the @entity252 team on wednesday and went shooting			1

@entity256 ' side face @entity18 in the fifth test at the @entity7
a draw would seal a series win a year after they beat @entity29
@entity53 did n't even train with the tourists on wednesday
