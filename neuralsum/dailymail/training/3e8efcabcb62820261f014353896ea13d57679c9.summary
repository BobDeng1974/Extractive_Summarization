by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 25 july 2013 increasing numbers of ' wild swimmers ' are suffering stomach upsets and ear complaints after bathing in rivers , lakes and gravel pits during the recent hot weather , according to new research			1
double the number of enthusiastic open water swimmers have contacted pharmacies compared to last year for health advice after swimming in open water			1
complaints include abrasions to hands and feet caused by stony riverbeds and rock pools and ' swimmers itch ' - an itchy rash caused by certain parasites that normally live in freshwater snails			1
wild swimming - swimming in open water such as the sea , a river or gravel pits - is becoming increasingly popular			1
experts say that the trend , combined with the hot weather is responsible for an increase in people developing infections @entity36 pharmacist @entity35 said : ' many stomach upsets are caused by swallowing dirty water , so we advise swimmers to avoid this and to always wash their hands and shower afterwards			1
' it is also important not to eat anything until you are sure your hands are clean			2
this advice is backed up by a report published by @entity50 in may this year , following an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness amongst participants in a sponsored swim in the @entity55 last year			1
over 1,000 people took part in the @entity59 swim and 338 reported symptoms of nausea , diarrhoea , stomach cramps and vomiting			2
the report revealed that this is likely to have been a result of swallowing river water and inadequate hygiene precautions when handling wetsuits			1
experts have advised people to keep the amount of water consumed during a swim to be kept to a minimum waterborne diseases are far from uncommon in @entity77 – in 2010 @entity79 - winning rower @entity80 last year of water - borne @entity82 ’s disease			1
whether due to sewage or infections spread by wildlife , open water can easily become contaminated			2
@entity88 usually provides fewer problems because water can not stagnate and its saltiness prevents bacteria proliferation			2
@entity94 swimming is more risky			2
dr @entity95 , regional director for @entity96 , said : ' open water swimming is growing in popularity in the @entity77			1
' many people may already be aware that swimming in natural rivers and lakes , which may not be designated bathing waters , carries a risk of picking up infections			1
' sponsored open water swims and triathlons have seen a surge in popularity			0
the @entity110 started in 2008 with 3,000 participants and now has more than 10,000 are taking the plunge every year			0
the boom in wild swimming has also seen greater numbers of people getting blocked ears and temporary hearing problems , according to dr @entity119 of the @entity120 , which specialises in earwax removal			1
this is due to earwax absorbing water , which causes it to expand , blocking the ear canal			0
experts say there are many health benefits to wild swimming which include boosting cardiovascular health , improving the immune system and giving swimmers a natural high thanks to endorphins triggered by the cold water			1
@entity135 studies have also shown that over a 12 - week period , repeated cold swimming leads to substantial bodily changes known as ‘ cold adaptation ’			1
this results in reducing blood pressure , cholesterol and fat disposition , inhibiting blood clotting and increasing fertility and libido in both men and women			0
this is echoed by advice from pharmacists , who say wild swimming can be great fun , but sensible precautions should be taken			1
@entity35 added : ' swimmers with cuts are advised not to swim outdoors to avoid the risk of infection			0
they should also ensure that they do n’t get too cold , and always have warm clothes to put on afterwards			0
' wild swimmers are also advised to consult the @entity161 ’s website to check the water quality of their local bathing spot before taking the plunge			1
@entity165 swimmer ’s itch is a short - term , uncomfortable but harmless immune reaction to a flatworm parasite called schistosomatidae			1
symptoms , which include itchy , raised papules , which commonly occur within hours of infection and do not generally last more than a week			0
these parasites use both freshwater snails and vertebrates as hosts in their parasitic life cycles			1
@entity82 ’s @entity179 @entity180 or @entity82 's disease is a bacterial infection spread by animal urine			0
symptoms include vomiting , diarrhoea , severe headaches , muscle pain , fatigue and , without treatment , fatal organ failure			0
according to the @entity192 , 58 @entity77 contracted it in 2009 , and eight people have died from @entity82 's in the past 13 years			2
fishermen , canoeists and jet - skiers are the usual victims because they often cut themselves in the water			2
experts advise wearing sandals to avoid cuts and scratches and , if you already have a wound , keeping out of the water			2
never swim in an urban area unless you know it is monitored for safety and never swim in flood water			0
@entity211 @entity212 ( parasite pictured ) can cause vomitting and stomach rashes @entity211 is caused by a parasite called @entity217 ( @entity217 ) , which targets the small intestine			0
it is most common in children aged from one to five , but can affect anyone - about 5,500 @entity77 are infected with the parasite each year			0
symptoms include diarrhoea , vomiting , dehydration , severe headache and sometimes a rash around the stomach			2
untreated , @entity211 can be fatal in the very young or old but those with a healthy immune system normally recover within a month			0
it is common in streams where cows or sheep may have urinated			0
e.colinormally associated with food poisoning , @entity236 bacteria can also be picked up from streams and rivers containing sewage			0
symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea and can be fatal in the very young and old but is easily treated with antibiotics and healthy adults will usually recover quickly			0
@entity246 otitis externa is a common infection that affects the ear canal and is known as swimmer 's ear because regular swimmers are five times more likely to develop the infection			1
small scratches , cuts or blemishes leave the ear vulnerable to bacteria that are plentiful in water , which causes the ear to become inflamed and itchy			0
in severe cases the ear will excrete discharge , causing temporary deafness			0
@entity266 in warm weather blue - green bacteria called cyanobacteria can cover the surface of slow - moving water			2
@entity266 rarely kills but can trigger itchy rashes , stomach upsets and , in severe cases , allergic reactions that cause difficulty breathing .			0

research by @entity36 has revealed that number of people seeking medical advice for swimming - related illness has *rocketed* over three weeks
complaints include hand and *leg* abrasions and ' swimmer 's itch ' , a rash caused by certain parasites that live in freshwater snails
experts have advised to keep the water away from the mouth and to clean yourself thoroughly after taking a dip - especially if in freshwater
