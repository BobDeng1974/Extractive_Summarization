in the last prime minister ’s questions before the @entity4 referendum , @entity0 was given a stark warning			2
@entity7 grandee sir @entity6 told the pm he had been ' complacent ' about the risk of @entity4 leaving the @entity9 which would trigger a ' national humiliation of catastrophic proportions '			2
four days later , the @entity13 party leaders – and much of the @entity15 - based media – were jolted out of the assumption that the @entity17 was safe , when a @entity19 poll put the @entity21 campaign ahead			1
it triggered extraordinary panic , saw mr @entity0 , @entity24 and @entity26 rush north to campaign , and led to the offer of increased tax and spending powers to @entity4 which will reshape the whole of the @entity9			1
in the year to august , @entity45 had enjoyed a lead on average of 22 points			2
but as referendum day approached , and @entity51 triumphed in the second live tv debate with @entity53 , the polls narrowed dramatically			2
late on saturday september 6 , details of a @entity19 poll for the @entity56 emerged , putting @entity21 on 51 per cent and @entity57 on 49 per cent			1
it was a huge boost for mr @entity51 , and a wake - up call for complacent politicians in @entity13			1
while there had been a trend of the polls narrowing , as more and more ‘ undecided ’ voters fell to one side or the other , it came as a huge shock			1
mr @entity0 cancelled prime minister ’s questions to fly to @entity4 , where he urged voters not to use the referendum to give ‘ the effing @entity7 a kicking ’			2
@entity73 ’s @entity24 and @entity74 @entity26 also took to the campaign trail			1
but it was the dramatic revival of former prime minister @entity77 which proved to be the most significant consequence of the @entity19 survey			1
building up a head of steam during a series of public meetings and rallies , mr @entity77 appeared to bounce the @entity13 parties into a new timetable for increased powers for devolution			0
he announced his cross-party package of measures giving @entity4 greater control over spending , welfare and taxation could be in place by the end of next month and in operation by the end of january			0
now there are growing doubts about whether the package was necessary , and offered in a rush to reverse one opinion poll			1
eminent elections expert professor @entity104 said : ' i doubt the @entity21 campaign were ever ahead			1
' and @entity107 , from polling firm @entity108 , said : ' the move to afford @entity4 greater powers looks like a knee - jerk reaction - opening a @entity111 in @entity13 that creates problems for both mr @entity0 and mr @entity24 in the run - up to the @entity115			1
' an overnight survey carried out by @entity33 reveals more details about how @entity4 actually voted			0
the poll of 2,000 people shows that the no campaign won among men ( by a six - point margin ) as well as women ( by twelve points )			1
it contradicts earlier surveys suggesting men were split 50:50 , with women overwhelmingly against independence			0
almost three quarters ( 73 per cent ) of those aged 65 or over voted no , while 51 per cent of 16 - 24 - year - olds back yes , along with 59 per cent of 25 - 34 - year - olds			1
lord @entity33 said : ‘ as the recent tightening in the polls suggested , those who made up their minds late in the campaign were more likely to choose independence			1
@entity51 claimed the @entity4 people were moving in their droves to the ' yes ' campaign and confidently predicted that they would back independence but only his party 's supporters backed separation the under 55s in @entity4 backed independence but were out - voted by the older generation of @entity4 @entity51 's campaign against the @entity17 dramatically increased support for independence - but was not quite enough ‘ two thirds of those who decided in the last few days voted yes ; no voters were much more likely than @entity21 supporters to say they decided more than a year ago or always knew how they would vote			1
’ mr @entity77 ’s offer of more powers to @entity4 now risks overhauling th whole of the @entity9			0
in a statement in @entity160 this morning , mr @entity0 said he would use the opportunity to pursue ‘ @entity163 votes for @entity163 matters ’			0
mr @entity77 said new powers could be voted on in the @entity166 next year			0
@entity51 said @entity4 expected the new deal to be agreed by this date			0
however , @entity170 and @entity73 mps are at odds over how the new settlement will work , throwing the future of @entity4 devolution into doubt			2
mr @entity0 said it was ' crucial ' to give @entity163 the same powers over tax , spending and welfare as @entity4			0
he pledged to make this happen at the same time as devolving powers to @entity4 , following his last minute pledge for further devolution during the referendum campaign			2
mr @entity0 said : ' the people of @entity4 have spoken			0
it is a clear result			0
they have kept our country of four nations together			0
like millions of other people , i am delighted			0
' he said it was now time for the @entity9 ' to come together and to move forward ' .			0

party leaders ' panicked ' after shock @entity19 poll put ' yes ' campaign on 51 *%*
but experts claim the game - *changing* poll was probably *wrong* all along
