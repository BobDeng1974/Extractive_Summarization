by @entity0 for @entity2 , a former garment worker from the @entity4 capital @entity5 , the nightmares continue a year after she and more than 3,000 others were trapped in the rubble of @entity8			1
although she survived , 1,129 people were killed , among them her younger sister , whose body was so badly damaged , it had to be identified using dna testing			1
a year on from the disaster , ms @entity2 , who lost an arm in the collapse , says not enough is being done to help survivors with many , herself among them , left to fend for themselves			1
' we did not get her dead body			1
we found her grave later , from a dna sample			1
' @entity8 , an eight - storey building that housed five factories making clothes for @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 among others , collapsed on the morning of the 24th april 2013			1
despite having planning permission for just five floors , owner @entity38 managed to persuade authorities to turn a blind eye to a further three , which like the rest of the building , had been put up as cheaply and quickly as possible			1
although a crack in a pillar had been spotted the day before , owner @entity38 insisted that the building was safe and instructed workers to return on the 24th			1
by the time the building collapsed at 8.45am , the huge tower block was crammed with workers , among them ms @entity2 and her sister			1
' i woke up that day and cooked , ' remembers ms @entity2			1
' then i had breakfast			2
i fed my daughter , then sent her to school			2
i thought i ’d have it after work			2
' disaster : a rescue worker stands in front of the remains of @entity8 in @entity66 , 30km from capital @entity5 rescue : the last survivor was pulled out of the rubble 17 days after the building collapsed when she arrived at @entity8 , it was to find the building surrounded by worried workers , spooked by the previous night 's tv reports of a crack in the infrastructure			1
under the threat of wage cuts , ms @entity2 and fellow workers were convinced to go inside and begin the day 's work as normal			1
' after i went inside i saw the rumour was true , ' says ms @entity2 who had worked as a seamstress in a second floor factory			1
' there was a crack in the pillar and the rods had come out			2
there were cracks in the ceiling too			2
it could collapse any time			2
i told my sister , " we made a mistake coming , let ’s leave "			1
' but it was too late			2
as the factories of @entity8 whirred into life , intense vibrations from the eighth floor generators and heavy looms elsewhere proved more than the weakened infrastructure could cope with			1
' suddenly we heard a loud noise , at around 8:45am , ' says @entity108 , a production manager who worked on the fifth floor of @entity8			1
' it was like the sound of a bomb going off			2
it sounded exactly the same			2
when i heard the noise , i looked up and saw everything collapsing			2
' the building took just 90 seconds to collapse , leaving thousands of workers trapped inside the rubble , among them mr @entity120 and ms @entity2			1
' i regained consciousness 20 minutes later , ' said mr @entity120			2
' there was a wall on both my legs			2
a rod had gone through my right leg			2
i was lying on my back			2
when i looked up i saw the ceiling was six inches above me			2
i had my phone in my hand and checked it			2
there was no reception , so i could not call anyone			2
' ' all i could think was where is my sister ? ' , remembers ms @entity2			1
' i was worried about her and i was panicking			0
i stood there and screamed and as soon as i screamed i fell into darkness			0
i was calling my sister ’s name			0
' pain : @entity108 was badly hurt in the disaster but hopes to one day open his own leather workshop @entity144 : one of the 2.515 wounded survivors is carried away from the remains of @entity8 like mr @entity120 , when ms @entity2 awoke minutes later , it was to find herself trapped beneath the rubble and in agony from her wounds			1
' i was lying in a cramped space in darkness , ' she says			0
' my arm was trapped under rods , beams , machines , and tables			1
' my head hurt and i was bleeding from my ear			0
many of the people around me had died			1
their blood rolled down my body			0
i was thinking , where is my sister ? ' unbeknown to ms @entity2 , her sister was already dead and it would be another 48 hours before rescuers appeared			1
mr @entity120 , lying trapped in the rubble with a broken leg , was also in for a long wait			1
' sometimes we were screaming , " save us , save us , save us " , ' he remembers			0
' we could hear sounds outside but we did not know if anyone could hear us			0
then we realised they were rescuing people			1
i told everyone we are alive so we will survive			0
they will rescue us , either today or tomorrow			0
under arrest : four days after the disaster , owner @entity38 was arrested as he tried to flee @entity4 horrific : many of the victims of the disaster were women , among them @entity2 's younger sister ' @entity187 was passing			1
we did not feel hungry			0
we did not feel anything			0
then we heard someone from outside call , " is there someone in there ? " ' we screamed , " save us , save us "			0
one of the people said " ok , we are coming "			1
then one guy came , a rescuer			0
' he put some trousers under me , denim ones from the label sewing section			0
they dragged me out , using those trousers			0
' two people held me from the back and two people folded my knees from the front			1
i was in a lot of pain			0
i think of that moment sometimes			0
that 's what i think of most			0
for ms @entity2 , her arm pinned down with a chunk of concrete for more than 48 hours , getting out of @entity8 meant being forced to hack off her own limb with a saw			1
' i never thought that i ’d have to amputate my own arm , ' she says			1
' but i was forced to by the situation			1
the doctor tried to amputate it but could n’t reach			0
' i said , " no matter how hard it is , amputate my arm "			1
he said , " i ’m giving you a saw and you can do it yourself "			0
' at first i said , " i ca n’t			0
" it was the start of the third day			0
he said , " give it a try "			0
i said , " ok , give it to me " and i cut it			1
i had only one thing on my mind , to look for my sister			0
that ’s why i could do it			0
' for both mr @entity120 and ms @entity2 , life since the disaster has been tough			1
both are still receiving treatment and neither have had much help			0
' i ’m having treatment in the hospital , ' says mr @entity120			0
; i do n’t know for how long			0
it will be a long process			0
' but i am hoping to start a leather goods business very soon			0
i tell everyone this - i ask you to pray i can do it			0
' ms @entity2 says her future looks bleak			1
' i never imagined in my entire life that i ’d have to see my younger sister ’s grave , ' she says , tears rolling down her cheeks			0
' i ’d hoped to do a lot of things			0
what will i hope for now ? i have only one hand			0
i ca n't do anything			0
' @entity2 and @entity108 appear on this world : clothes to die for , tonight at 9pm on @entity273			1
