as a physics graduate from @entity2 , @entity0 is partial to a scientific experiment			2
the @entity6 and @entity7 lock ’s latest trial is to see whether blood - sucking leeches can cure his cauliflower ears			1
after beginning to suffer hearing difficulties because of the condition — caused by excessive pressure on the ear in the scrum and the tackle — the 27 - year - old decided to try a different approach to fix the problem			0
‘ a couple of the @entity6 and @entity7 physios jokingly mentioned it half - heartedly , ’ @entity0 told @entity19			1
leeches suck the blood out			0
they do n’t suck masses out but they do inject an anticoagulant into the ear that should help break down some of the blood clots and reduce swelling			2
‘ it ’s a bit of a lost cause at the moment so i have n’t really got much to lose			0
‘ the classic method is syringing where you just stick a needle in and suck out a load of blood			0
once the skin tears away from the cartilage , that pocket fills up with blood and it ca n’t escape anywhere , then it hardens			1
‘ hopefully these leeches will give me another lifeline — i would quite like to be able to start using earbuds again ! ’ @entity0 of @entity7 holds onto @entity62 of @entity63 in an @entity65 match @entity0 issues instructions during an @entity6 training session at @entity68 in november			1

@entity6 lock @entity0 has been sticking leeches on his ears
the @entity7 *forward* hopes the *creatures* will help cure the blood clots
cauliflower ears are caused when the skin tears away from the cartilage
the pocket in between then fills with blood that begins to harden
syringes are *traditionally* used to fix the problem
