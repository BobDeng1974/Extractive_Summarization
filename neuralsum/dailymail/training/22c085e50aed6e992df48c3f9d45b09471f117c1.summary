across the country , in the first election since both parties fully embraced the new world of campaign finance created by @entity6 decisions , including @entity7 , the television ads during the campaign 's final hours were practically nothing but politics			1
total federal spending was expected to reach the $ 4 billion mark , pushing these midterm elections to record levels			0
deep - pocketed donors funneled millions to outside groups , which in many races accounted for more than two - thirds of the spending in competitive races			1
in the 10 most expensive @entity24 races , nine have more than a dozen outside groups paying for ads. in eight of the 12 most expensive races , outside groups spent more than the actual people on the ballots did			1
of that , $ 76 million was coming from outside groups trying to shape the outcome of @entity40 sen. @entity39 's re-election bid in @entity41 against @entity43 state house speaker @entity42			1
midterm elections in 2014 have shaped up to be the most expensive ever as the new campaign finance landscape -- with the help of @entity47 and ' dark money ' non-profits -- has become the norm for both parties			1
super pacs these groups can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to independently advocate the election or defeat of candidates			1
thanks to @entity7 , as of 2010 their revenue streams can come from corporations			1
they are not tied to specific parties or candidates			1
the @entity40 ' biggest super pac , @entity64 , has spent at least $ 5.5 million on the @entity66 race			0
in all , the group , which has ties to senate majority leader @entity69 , has unleashed $ 47.1 million to keep democrats in control of the chamber			0
the @entity74 - backed network of @entity75 and @entity76 has spent at least $ 4.6 million in @entity66 , part of the $ 46.7 million in spending it reported to the @entity79 through monday afternoon			1
' dark money ' these groups , unlike @entity47 , are not required to disclose the names of their top donors			1
a network of conservative groups backed by the billionaires @entity88 and @entity89 , for instance , spent at least $ 400 million in the 2012 elections			1
those ' dark money ' groups , organized under section 501 ( c ) of the tax code , differ from so - called ' @entity47 , ' which can advocate directly for candidates , but must disclose the identity of their donors			1
for instance , the most expensive race for @entity24 in the nation had topped the $ 108 million mark by monday			0
of that , $ 76 million was coming from outside groups trying to shape the outcome of @entity40 sen. @entity39 's re-election bid in @entity41 against @entity43 state house speaker @entity42			1
as here in @entity66 , much of that cash came in the form of television ads that left voters overloaded			0
' i 've seen enough of them to last me a lifetime , ' said 74 - year - old retiree @entity114 , who cast his ballot early in @entity116			1
' i just hit the mute button and let them do their talking			0
' the pricey race in @entity66 between @entity40 sen. @entity121 and @entity122 rep. @entity122 , as well as two competitive @entity124 contests and one for a soon - to - be - open governor 's office , filled the air between @entity129 's television programs with enough ads this past weekend so that , theoretically , every targeted voter would see 34 political commercials a day			1
@entity134 's seat is crucial to @entity40 ' hopes of keeping their majority in the @entity24			1
should @entity43 win here and pick up five seats elsewhere , they 'll have control of the chamber for the first time since @entity40 prevailed in the 2006 election			2
in all , more than 500 outside groups had reported federal spending from @entity146 to @entity147			2
that 's why escaping politics on tv was next to impossible just about anywhere with a competitive race on tuesday 's ballot			2
in @entity41 , candidates and their allies have spent $ 62 million to run almost 102,000 ads this campaign season			2
@entity157 has seen almost $ 43 million in ads , running some 65,000 times			0
and @entity160 has seen at least 79,000 ads at a cost of $ 34 million , according to an analysis from the @entity164 , using the widely accepted estimates from media tracking firm @entity168 / @entity167			0
pricey : comparatively small @entity66 is spending @entity170 times as much on television advertising than populous @entity172 this year as rep. @entity173 tries to take the @entity24 seat of @entity40 incumbent @entity121			2
in all , @entity121 , @entity122 and their supporters in @entity66 have spent more than $ 26 million to bombard viewers with roughly 60,000 messages			0
more than $ 56 million has been spent overall on the race in all , @entity121 , @entity122 and their supporters in @entity66 have spent more than $ 26 million to bombard viewers with roughly 60,000 messages			0
more than $ 56 million has been spent overall on the race			0
@entity184 ' last - minute efforts to find airtime guaranteed the total costs would spike at the end			2
last week , @entity121 spotted an available 30 - second spot during ' @entity189 ' and shelled out the $ 4,400 station @entity191 demanded			2
days later , @entity122 bought a $ 15,000 ad during saturday 's 5 p.m. broadcast at the same station			2
and @entity195 's @entity129 affiliate @entity194 charged @entity64 $ 11,000 for one spot during sunday 's @entity198 game			2
as the election gets closer , airtime becomes scarcer and prices go up			0
many of the political groups planned ahead , but those that did not find themselves paying a premium			0
the @entity124 @entity40 ' campaign committee in the spring asked stations to set aside $ 1.5 million in ad time in the @entity129 area to saturate the market for five weeks			0
months later , the @entity74 - backed @entity75 spent the same amount but got just one - third the airtime			0
the @entity213 came in even later and paid $ 1 million			0
that sum was worth just one week of ads. it 's all too much for @entity218 resident @entity217 , who says that when a campaign ad comes on his tv , ' i flip			1
' the ads , which he describes as ' sad , ' are even pestering the 55 - year - old when he sits down at his computer			1
' you ca n't even click on a website without getting it , ' @entity217 said			0
' you have to wait through 15 seconds before you can even watch something on @entity231			0

this year 's election is the first in which both parties have fully embraced the new campaign finance landscape
the @entity240 @entity6 decision has helped pave the way as corporations may now spend on campaigns *freely*
so - called ' dark money ' groups offer *anonymity* for donors through 501 ( c ) non-profits
