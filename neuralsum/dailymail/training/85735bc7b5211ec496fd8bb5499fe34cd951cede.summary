@entity8 said @entity3 died after a long illness			1
she did not say where he died			0
@entity3 swept heroically across the international stage in the final years of the @entity4 empire , helping topple the @entity12 and end the @entity13 , but as the leader of @entity6 his career in the public eye ended in humiliation and he was chased out of his parliament and forced into retirement			1
influential : @entity3 , pictured during an interview at his home in @entity22 , @entity6 , in 2010 , swept across the international stage in the final years of the @entity4 empire , helping topple the @entity12 and end the @entity13 as @entity4 foreign minister , the white - haired man with a gravelly voice was the diplomatic face of @entity28 's liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika			1
following the wooden @entity31 , @entity3 impressed @entity33 leaders with his charisma , his quick wit and his commitment to @entity28 's reform course			1
@entity3 helped push through the withdrawal of @entity4 troops from @entity40 in 1989 , signed landmark arms control agreements , and helped negotiate @entity43 reunification in 1990 — a development that @entity4 leaders had long feared and staunchly opposed			1
@entity33 leaders , especially @entity43 , would remain grateful for @entity3 's work as foreign minister			1
but in the @entity51 , those nostalgic for a return to superpower status lumped @entity3 with @entity28 in the ranks of the unpardonable			2
@entity3 resigned in december 1990 , warning that reform was collapsing and dictatorship was imminent			2
a year later , the @entity51 collapsed in the wake of an attempted hardline coup against @entity28			0
positive contribution : @entity33 leaders , especially @entity43 , would remain grateful for @entity3 's work as foreign minister @entity3 returned to @entity6 after its first elected president , @entity59 , was ousted in a coup in 1992 ; @entity3 was elected speaker of parliament and became the country 's leader			1
@entity59 died under mysterious circumstances in 1993 , and @entity3 was elected president for a five - year term in 1995 after the country adopted a new constitution			1
he survived two assassination attempts , including an assault on his motorcade with anti-tank weapons			0
many observers suggested the attacks blunted @entity3 's reformist impulses and left him interested only in holding onto power			1
although he had pursued a @entity33 policy , @entity6 under @entity79 became plagued by corruption and a deterioration of democracy			2
in november 2003 , massive demonstrations that became known as the @entity84 erupted after allegations of widespread fraud in a parliamentary election			0
police maintained a low profile — @entity3 later said he feared any police action against the demonstrators would lead to terrible bloodshed			2
after three weeks , protesters led by future president @entity94 broke into a parliament session where @entity3 was speaking and drove him out of the building			2
@entity3 was born on jan. 25 , 1928 in the village of @entity98 near @entity6 's @entity100 coast , the fifth and final child in a rural family that hoped he would become a doctor			1
instead , he launched a political career at age 20 by joining the @entity107 , and received a university degree only 31 years later from a teachers ' institute			0
he steadily rose through the ranks of the party , its @entity114 youth organization and @entity6 's police force until being named the republic 's interior minister , the top law enforcement official			2
he gained a reputation for purging corrupt @entity120 officials and forcing them to give up ill - gotten cars , mansions and other property			0
@entity124 ( right ) with president @entity125 and secretary of state @entity126 ( left ) at the @entity127 in 1988 @entity3 's anti-corruption campaign caught the attention of @entity4 officials in @entity131 , and he was named @entity107 chief of @entity6 in 1972			1
he eased censorship and permitted his republic to become one of the most progressive in the cultural sphere , producing a stream of taboo - breaking films and theatrical productions			0
@entity3 was appointed @entity4 foreign minister in 1985			1
he resigned five years later to protest plans to use force to quell unrest in the @entity51			0
he joined @entity146 leader @entity145 in resisting an attempted coup against @entity28 in august 1991 , and returned to the foreign minister 's job for a brief stint later that year , as the @entity51 sped toward extinction			1
when he returned to @entity6 , he inherited a country wracked by chaos			0
@entity154 broke out in 1990 in the northern province of @entity156 , bordering on @entity146 , after the nationalist @entity120 government voted to deprive the province of its autonomy			0
a more serious secessionist uprising followed in the province of @entity163			0
the small region , bordered by the @entity100 and @entity146 , has been effectively independent since separatists drove out government forces during a 1992 - 93 war			0
the two sides reached a cease - fire in 1994 , but peace talks on a political solution have stalled			0
even the capital @entity22 was run by politically connected gangs and gang - related politicians , and legislators had to be reminded to check their guns before entering parliament			0
@entity3 managed to disarm the most notorious gang , the @entity179 or @entity180 , in 1995 , after the first attempt to kill him			2
the political chaos was accompanied by economic hardship			0
@entity6 lost @entity4 - era orders for its factories			2
every winter , @entity120 suffered gas and electricity outages			0
in spite of @entity3 's communist - era record as a " clean - hands " politician , corruption gripped the country at every level			1
@entity3 shepherded @entity6 into the @entity196 , and said on occasion — to @entity131 's considerable irritation — that @entity22 would one day " knock on @entity200 's door			1
" @entity202 officials forged close ties with @entity3 , and the @entity202 government gave his nation millions of dollars in aid in hopes of keeping @entity6 in the western orbit			0
