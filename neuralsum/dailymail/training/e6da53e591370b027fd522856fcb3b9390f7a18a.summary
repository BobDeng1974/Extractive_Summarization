by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 08:26 est , 25 may 2012 @entity3 fixer @entity1 launched a relentless campaign of schmoozing to win influence with @entity7 ’s most senior advisers			1
during the @entity3 empire ’s bid for @entity10 mr @entity1 sent and received 799 text messages to individuals in the @entity13 , as well as 191 telephone calls and 158 emails			1
relations were so warm between @entity17 and the @entity3 empire that the prime minister ’s director of communications @entity20 enjoyed a social dinner with mr @entity1 just two days after it emerged that the @entity23 hacked the phone messages of murdered schoolgirl @entity25			1
contacts : @entity29 aide @entity28 , left , and @entity31 lobbyist @entity30 , right , told the inquiry they had exchanged more than 1,400 texts , emails and calls details : @entity28 arrives at the @entity38 to give evidence to @entity40 today as questions are asked about his dealings with @entity31 mr @entity1 also revealed that mr @entity7 ’s press secretary @entity43 sent text messages to @entity46 boss @entity45 on the same day			1
evidence submitted by mr @entity1 , the former @entity31 director of public affairs , shows he bombarded special advisers in @entity49 , the @entity50 and the @entity51 with more than 1,000 text messages			1
mr @entity1 revealed that he was also in touch with mr @entity7 ’s former communications director @entity54 , his policy gurus @entity55 and @entity57 and he also admitted lobbying chancellor @entity59 ’s special adviser @entity58 for favours			1
@entity61 , counsel for the inquiry , revealed that mr @entity1 had sought a meeting at a ‘ discreet location ’ with mr @entity20 and @entity46 troubleshooter @entity65			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ the dinner was going to be with the wives			2
there were two locations floated and we ended up in a location which was not discreet at all			0
’ @entity49 was forced to step in last night amid claims that mr @entity20 should have declared the meeting under the civil service code of conduct			0
mr @entity7 ’s official spokesman revealed that ‘ the meeting was on july 6 last year ’ but did not have to be declared since mr @entity20 and mr @entity1 split the bill and civil servants only have to declare hospitality , not meetings , with media figures			1
‘ @entity20 ’s contact with @entity1 was entirely appropriate			2
it was a social occasion and originally had been for @entity20 to meet @entity65 , @entity1 and their wives but @entity65 dropped out because his wife had given birth			2
they paid for their own meals			0
’ but the timing of the meeting raises questions about the wisdom of a senior no 10 figure meeting with a @entity3 envoy as the @entity25 hacking scandal had erupted			2
the @entity40 heard that mr @entity1 sent a text to @entity43 on 6 july 2011 saying : ‘ thank you for your messages to @entity45 last night			1
’ scandal : culture secretary @entity29 ( right ) with @entity28 , his former special adviser , who will appear later today inquiry : @entity98 called @entity1 and @entity28 to shed light on the government 's handling of @entity31 's £ 8 billion bid mr @entity1 told the inquiry : ‘ i do n’t know what the message contained			1
i only knew that @entity45 told me she had got messages from @entity43			0
’ mr @entity61 said the messages might be ‘ the indirect communication ’ from mr @entity7 that mrs @entity45 revealed when she gave evidence			2
but miss @entity43 said last night that she was not passing on messages from the prime minister			0
‘ they were personal texts to @entity45			0
i was not an emissary			0
i did n’t send anything on behalf of the prime minister			0
’ friends said she told mrs @entity117 that she had fought hard for the families of murdered children when she was editor of the @entity23 , including another murdered schoolgirl @entity120			0
the @entity40 also heard that mr @entity1 unsuccessfully sought two favours from @entity59 ’s most senior aide @entity58			1
in november 2010 , mr @entity1 texted him to get the chancellor to lobby business secretary @entity125 , who was then in charge of the @entity10 bid , to push it through			1
‘ it would be helpful if @entity59 were to send a letter to @entity125 on our @entity10 merger and its economic importance separate from the @entity135 process			0
do you think it ’s a possibility ? i can of course help with the content			0
’ in july the following year , when the @entity140 scandal was raging , he asked for a senior politician to condemn hacking but insist on a police investigation – an apparent attempt to prevent a public inquiry into the hacking			0
neither request led to results			0
mr @entity1 confessed that he was a ‘ text obsessive ’ and was also in touch with @entity152 ’s senior aides @entity150 and @entity153			1
mr @entity1 often exchanged messages in cod @entity156 and provoked the same response in others			2
when he praised one performance at the despatch box , the @entity160 responded : ‘ @entity163			0

@entity3 's lobbyist @entity30 tells @entity40 he was ' never told ' to halt contact
' my view is that @entity29 was probably *supportive* of some of the *arguments* we were putting *forward* , ' he added
@entity1 and @entity29 have several friendly text *conversations*
' you were great at @entity178 today . ' @entity29 replied : ' merci , large drink tonight ' .
@entity1 says *infamous* ' *absolutely* *illegal* ' comment about @entity183 *briefing* *ahead* of a @entity29 *announcement* in @entity185 was ' a very *bad* joke '
@entity29 sends memo to @entity7 a month before he was put in charge of bid saying the *takeover* should go through
' if we block it our media sector will suffer for years , ' mr @entity29 told the *pm*
