and if you pride yourself on your friendliness and ability to stay calm in a crisis , you 're most likely to be @entity7			1
this is according to experts at @entity10 , who have marked out a personality map of the whole of @entity13			1
revealed : the moody map of @entity13 details the country 's most and least friendly inhabitants the profile revealed that inhabitants of the capital are the least welcoming of all			1
the @entity21 also fare badly , with the researchers declaring them to be exceptionally shy and neurotic			2
the @entity7 , however , can hold their heads high , as they are the friendliest and most emotionally stable people in @entity13			1
to find out what where we live says about us , psychologists asked almost 400,000 @entity13 a series of questions designed to assess five key personality traits			1
they then looked to see how common each of the five characteristics – agreeableness , extraversion , openness , conscientiousness and neuroticism – was in each of the 380 council areas in @entity40 , @entity7 and @entity21			1
characteristics : people in the @entity3 were among the most conscientious ( left ) , suggesting that like residents of the @entity44 , they are dependable , reliable types			0
meanwhile those who lived in the capital scored highly on extraversion ( right ) , as did the people of @entity49 mapped out : the @entity7 scored highest in agreeableness ( left ) , which covers friendliness , trust , co-operation and concern about others			1
the @entity7 also emerged as the least neurotic ( right ) and the most calm and contented			1
the colour red means a greater level of an attribute , while blue is for the opposite new experiences : inhabitants of the @entity63 and the east of @entity40 were the least open – leading to them being labelled ' conventional , down to earth and traditional ' the result is a fascinating , and at times controversial , snapshot of the psychology of @entity13			1
the @entity7 scored highest in agreeableness			1
the first of the five traits polled , it covers friendliness , trust , co-operation and concern about others			2
people in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 are also highly agreeable sorts			0
and at the other end of the scale are the residents of @entity87 , who were found to be the least friendly of all			1
rather than being warm and welcoming , they are likely to be uncooperative , quarrelsome and irritable , the journal @entity92 reports			0
those who lived in the capital , however , scored highly on extraversion , as did the people of @entity49			0
in contrast , those living in the @entity44 and parts of @entity98 were among the most quiet and reserved			0
@entity100 fared badly in the study - they were found to be among some of @entity13 's least friendly residents city - dwellers also did well on another trait , openness			1
this is a measure of curiosity , imagination and intellect , and was particularly high in @entity87 , @entity111 , @entity10 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity49 and @entity114			1

however , people in the @entity3 were among the most conscientious , suggesting that like residents of the @entity44 , they are dependable , reliable types			0
londoners and the @entity21 fared badly once more , with the survey finding them to be among the most slapdash and unreliable			0

pictured is the charming seaside town of @entity133 , @entity79 researcher @entity134 said some of the results can be explained by people moving to areas that better suit their personality			2

but with personality traits linked to various illnesses , as well as rates of crime and even the way people vote , the results are more than just a bit of fun			2
