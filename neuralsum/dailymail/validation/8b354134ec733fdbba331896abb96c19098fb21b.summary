you may have experienced the eye - watering pain of an ingrown toenails , but imagine if you weighed 15,000 lbs ( 7,000 kg )			2
scientists are working to prevent painful and potentially deadly foot diseases in captive elephants by finding the best way to trim their feet			1
wild elephants benefit from walking long distances on different surfaces and rubbing their feet in abrasive dirt , but their captive peers can experience problems without these ‘ natural pedicures ’			1
dr @entity27 , from the @entity29 ’s @entity28 , is working with collaborators around the world to understand how captivity influences elephant foot form and function , as well as identifying the best method of preventative foot trimming			1
‘ elephants are the largest terrestrial mammals alive today and can weigh up to eight tonnes , with their whole body mass supported by their tiny feet , ’ dr @entity27 said			2
wild elephants ( a stock image is shown ) benefit from walking long distances on various surfaces and rubbing their feet in dirt , but their captive peers can experience problems without these ‘ natural pedicures ’ pressure plates were transported to the adventures with @entity53 in @entity54 ( pictured ) to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains ‘ we know that when these large animals walk , a huge amount of pressure is applied to their feet			1
earlier this month , researchers found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives			2
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones			0
three elephants passed smell tests conducted on a game reserve in @entity54			0
sniffing at buckets , they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of @entity88 by raising a front leg			0
the elephants detected @entity88 samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets , according to @entity96 , a zoology student at the @entity97 in @entity98			0
they only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive , which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper			0
in a second set of tests , the elephants scored 100 percent , detecting @entity88 in 23 out of 23 buckets when ‘ distractor odours ’ such as tea , bleach , soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets , she said			0
it 's been suggested that unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant , which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives			0
‘ preliminary data has indicated that foot pressure is more evenly distributed across the sole of the foot when the animals walk on natural grounds , but when they are walking on surfaces such as concrete the pressure is concentrated around parts of the foot that are more prone to disease , such as the lateral toes			1
’ she said that while a range of foot - trimming procedures are followed and typically involve filing the nails and rough skin , none have been tested			0
elephants ' toenails typically grow between five and seven millimetetres a month			2
‘ our research involves testing different techniques to see which one will be most beneficial for the animal , ’ dr @entity27 said			0
working with @entity151 in @entity152 , she has developed pressure platforms to measure the pressure and forces applied to elephants ’ feet while they are walking			1
‘ the plates were recently transported to the adventures with @entity53 in @entity54 to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains , ’ she said			1
‘ the elephants were trained to walk over the pressure platforms and the individual footsteps were processed using a state - of - the - art neuroimaging technique called statistical parametric mapping , which , in simple words , gives us a high - resolution image of foot pressure changes over the foot			1
‘ we hope to develop smaller versions of these pressure platforms for zoo keepers and managers to use as diagnostic tools			0
‘ if a captive elephant walks over a pad and a different digital pressure pattern from normal is seen , this can be investigated further			1
’ dr @entity27 said that early diagnosis is important because elephant foot diseases such as osteoarthritis and osteomyelitis are often diagnosed too late for treatment , meaning elephants have to be euthanized			2
dr @entity27 , from the @entity29 ’s @entity28 , is working with collaborators around the world to understand how captivity influences elephant foot form and function , as well as identifying the best method of preventative foot trimming ( a stock image of a man cutting toenails is shown )			1

wild elephants get a ' natural pedicure ' by rubbing their feet in the dirt
but captive animals can get foot problems if their toenails are *n't* trimmed
researcher from the @entity29 , @entity210 , has developed a pressure pad to measure the pressure *exerted* on elephants ' feet
data could inform the best way to trim toenails and allow *zookeepers* to spot potential foot problems , which can lead to elephants being put down
