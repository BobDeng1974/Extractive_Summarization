@entity0 has issued another recall - this time for vehicles that could possibly catch fire without their engines even running			1
this latest recall is for a group of @entity8 to fix power window switches that can catch fire			1
@entity0 has already issued dozens of recalls for defects this year alone to set a company record			1
the problem is so serious that @entity0 is telling customers to park the @entity8 outdoors until they are repaired because they could catch fire when left unattended , according to a recent court filing			1
recalled : a trio of unsold 2006 @entity21 sports utility vehicles sits in front of a @entity24 dealership , the vehilces have been recalled for a third time to fix power window switches that can catch fire the very same suvs were originally part of recall a june 30 announcement that covered 7.6 million vehicles			1
it covers about 189,000 vehicles in @entity35 , mainly from the 2006 and 2007 model years			1
models affected include the @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity21 , @entity40 and @entity41 97 - @entity42 @entity0 is advising people to leave them outside until parts are ready in october , at the earliest			1
the automaker also has ordered its dealers to stop selling the suvs as used cars until they are fixed			0
the beleagured automaker is in the midst of the biggest safety crisis in its history , touched off by the delayed recall of 2.6 million older small cars to fix faulty ignition switches			2
it has issued a record 60 recalls this year covering nearly 29 million vehicles			1
before this year , @entity0 had been reluctant to issue recalls , at times opting for lower - cost fixes for safety problems			1
it 's been fined $ 35 million by the @entity63 for lapses in reporting the ignition switch problems , which it blames for at least 13 deaths			0
after the ignition switch debacle , @entity0 did a companywide safety review , appointed a new global safety chief and pledged to recall cars quickly			1
the suv problem first appeared early in 2012 when @entity63 began investigating consumer complaints of fires in the driver 's - door switches that control power windows			2
also prone to risk : the 2006 @entity80 sport utility vehicle could also spontaneously burst into flames at first , @entity0 tried to address the issue with a ' service campaign , ' where it sent letters to owners telling them that water can find its way into the switches , causing rust that can result in short circuits , overheating and possibly fires			1
the campaign , which was n't a recall , extended the warranty and offered service only to vehicles that exhibited the problems			0
it was limited to 20 states and @entity100 , where salt is used to clear roads in the winter			0
but in august of 2012 , under government pressure , @entity0 recalled 278,000 of the @entity8 in the cold - weather states and offered extended warranties to the rest of the country			1
@entity63 kept investigating , and 10 months later , @entity0 expanded the recall nationwide			2
by then , @entity63 and @entity0 had received 242 complaints , including 28 about fires			2
in one complaint filed with @entity63 from october of 2008 , a woman reported that the alarm sounded while her 2006 @entity38 was parked in her driveway			1
when she looked outside , it was in flames			0
firefighters put out the blaze and told her it started in the driver 's door			0
' the fire burned the entire driver 's side of the vehicle , a portion of the front passenger seat and the roof , ' she wrote			0
people filing complaints are not identified by the agency			0
the fix used by @entity0 last year was to put a protective coating around the window switch circuit boards , which is less costly than replacing the switches			1
but starting this april , @entity0 received complaints that the switches malfunctioned in suvs that had been repaired			2
so in june , it decided to do the third recall and replace all of the switches			0
' we are recalling them because the fix that we put in did not work , ' spokesman @entity142 said thursday			0
' we 're taking care of it			0
we 're doing the right thing			0
' initially @entity0 tried the service campaign because number of incidents was low , he said			2
it was limited to the cold - weather states because salty water made the switches corrode quickly and incidents were few in warmer states , @entity142 said			2
letters notifying owners about the @entity8 recall should be mailed soon			0
owners will get a second letter sometime from october to december telling them when parts are available to fix the vehicles .			0

the automaker has recalled @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity21 , @entity40 and @entity41 97 - @entity169 models made in 2006 and 2007
a faulty power window switch and road salt are blamed
@entity0 has issued a total of 60 recalls affecting almost *29million* vehicles this year - a new record - high for the company
