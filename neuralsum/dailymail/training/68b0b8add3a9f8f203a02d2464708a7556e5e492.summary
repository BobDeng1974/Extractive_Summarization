incredible ‘ magical ’ trees that bear 40 different varieties of fruit have been popping up all over @entity3			1
these trees - which can simultaneously produce different varieties of peaches , plums , apricots , nectarines and cherries – look ordinary throughout most of the year			2
but in spring , they bloom into a stunning patchwork of colours , with each tree featuring its own unique selection of stone fruit			2
here a cgi shows what the trees will look like in spring as they become more mature they are the work of @entity31 sculptor and artist @entity30 who created the trees in an attempt to make people reconsider how food can be produced			1
the project began in 2008 when mr @entity30 discovered that a @entity39 state orchard , which held varieties of stone fruit 200 - years - old , was to be abandoned			1
in hopes of saving it , the artist bought the orchard , and soon after started experimenting with something known as ‘ chip grafting			1

the foreign tree part is then taped and left to heal over the winter			0
mr @entity30 explained that most stone - fruits are easily compatible			0
the ' @entity74 ' project was created using something known as chip grafting			1

mr @entity30 explained that most stone - fruits are easily compatible			0
grafting is usually done in winter or early spring with dormant scion wood			0
what he came up with is ‘ @entity88 ’ , which is in fact , not one tree , but a series of hybridised fruit plants			0
so far , mr @entity30 has created and placed 16 trees in museums , community centres and private art collections around the @entity3			2
in spring , the trees blossom in shades of pink , crimson and white , and in summer , they bear a range of stone fruit , as shown in mr @entity30 's @entity25 image			0
‘ i 've been told by people that have [ a tree ] at their home that it provides the perfect amount and perfect variety of fruit , ’ mr @entity30 told @entity104 at @entity105			0
‘ so rather than having one variety that produces more than you know what to do with , it provides good amounts of each of the 40 varieties			2
‘ since all of these fruit ripen at different times , from july through october , you also are n't inundated , ’ he said			0
mr @entity30 's trees can be seen in cities across the @entity3 , including @entity126 , @entity127 ; @entity128 , @entity129 ; @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , @entity39			1

project is the work of @entity39 - based sculptor and artist @entity58
he created plants to make people reconsider how food can be produced
they can be seen in cities across the @entity3 , including @entity126 , @entity127 ; @entity128 , @entity129 ; @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , @entity39
so far 16 ' magical ' trees have been produced using chip grafting *technique*
each one produces a *small* selection of fruits from 40 different varieties
the process involves taking a sliver off a tree , including the bud , and inserting that into a cut in the working tree
