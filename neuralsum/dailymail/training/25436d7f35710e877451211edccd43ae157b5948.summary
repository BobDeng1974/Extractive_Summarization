by @entity0 @entity1 is to try growing vegetables and herbs on the moon to see if humans could one day live there			1
the @entity8 space agency plans to send seeds to the moon in 2015 in sealed canisters containing everything that is needed for the seedlings to thrive			1
as well as ten seeds each of basil and turnips , there will also be around 100 seeds of @entity18 , a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard			2
the @entity22 are to send a batch of seedlings to the moon in sealed canisters and will monitor their growth which could indicate whether human beings would survive in space on landing , a trigger will release a small reservoir of water inside the canister and a team on @entity35 will monitor how the seeds germinate when exposed to lunar gravity and radiation			1
a group of scientists , students and volunteers - known as the @entity44 team - are behind the project which will see the seedlings photographed at intervals to compare with those planted on earth			1
the air in the sealed containers should be adequate for more than 5 days of growth			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ they can test the lunar environment for us , acting as a canary in a coal mine			0
' if we send plants and they thrive , then humans probably can			1
' thriving plants need the same ingredients for life as humans – food , water and air – and also provide psychological comfort for people , demonstrated by the popular greenhouses in @entity70 and the @entity71			2
the seeds will be sent to the moon in the @entity74 ( illustrated here by computer generation ) in 2015 @entity1 plans on sending the seedlings to the moon by hitching a lift on a commercial spacecraft called the @entity74 lander , which is competing to win @entity82 ’s @entity81 in 2015			1
scientists are currently constructing a unit to study the germination of the plants , which will have a mass of just one kilogram and will be deposited on the moon			2
water will be added to the seeds in the module after landing and their growth will be monitored for five to 10 days and compared to @entity35 - based control seedlings			0
@entity18 ( pictured ) , basil and turnip seeds will be sent to the moon in containers containing all the elements needed for the plants to grow on earth seeds will include @entity18 , basil , and turnips and @entity1 says the experiment will be the first of its kind on another world and ‘ an important first step in the utilisation of plants for human life support ’			1
follow - up experiments will improve the technology in the growth module and allow for more extensive plant experiments , the organisation said			0
survival for 14 days demonstrates plants can sprout in the moon ’s radiation environment but survival to 60 days demonstrates that sexual reproduction ( meiosis ) can occur in a lunar environment			0
survival to 180 days shows effects of radiation on dominant and recessive genetic traits and afterwards , the experiment may run for months through multiple generations , increasing science return			0
there has been a lot of research on plant growth in microgravity , on space shuttles and in the @entity71			0
but the surface of the moon is the only location in which the effects of both lunar gravity and lunar radiation on plant growth can be studied .			0

@entity8 space agency to send basil and turnip seeds among others to the moon
seedlings will be photographed at intervals to compare to those on earth
experts believe if plants thrive in space then humans ' probably can ' too
