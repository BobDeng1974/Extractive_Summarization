kicking off his dangerous high - speed journey at @entity6 at @entity7 , just outside of @entity8 , the unidentified driver cut cars off , dodged traffic and weaved across lanes to smash the 2010 record of 26 minutes , three seconds			1
the illict speed racer , who posted a @entity16 video of his august 26 race under the pseudonym @entity19 , has dismissed claims he is a reckless driver , saying he was in control the whole time			1
while some car enthusiasts on motoring blogs have praised the unknown driver , others say he sets a bad example for young drivers			2
however the driver has dismissed claims he was reckless while averaging speeds of 66 miles an hour			2
' whether you 're a good driver or not , when you 're on the road , you have a high chance of getting hit by a drunk driver , being cut off , especially in @entity51 , ' he told @entity52			0
' being a good driver , you 're more aware of what is around you			0
' being a fast driver does n't mean that you 're inherently a bad or reckless driver			0
' like i said before , i 'm in control			0
that said , understand traffic patterns , understand what 's around you and understand how others control or do n't control their cars			0
' record - breaker : the driver raced around the eastern edge of @entity1 and looped around the island Â¿ s southern tip dare - devil : the motorist weaved through traffic in the city 's tunnel but miraculously avoided a collision starting his lap just outside @entity8 , the mystery man drove his manual 2006 @entity79 down under the @entity80 , @entity1 , and @entity81 , then tore through the @entity82 around the downtown tip of the island			1
footage of the journey , compressed into a six - minute clip , shows the driver zip through west street / @entity89 , which finally opens up in @entity90 by all of @entity93 's buildings			0
heading north , he turns right by the @entity95 in @entity96 and gets across @entity1 at one of its narrowest points			2
he turns back onto @entity6 and races to the finish line , where he started the trip			2
sight - seeing : the driver was probably driving too fast to take in views of the @entity106 on the west side or the @entity108 on the east side new record ? the driver claims to have completed his journey in 24 minutes and seven seconds - the fastest time ever the driver said he prepared for the run by working out the traffic flows			1

i can do it consistently under 24 minutes and most likely beat my own record again			1

just watch out for the speeding tickets , ' he said			0
