by @entity0 published : 17:43 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 17:43 est , 19 may 2012 safety fears : a @entity2 with @entity3 have been taken off the shelves flea collars for pets are being withdrawn from sale after @entity8 revealed fears that they could poison children			1
leading manufacturer @entity2 is taking the action voluntarily after dog and cat owners began calling the company demanding to know the risks			1
it follows our report last week about a @entity21 decision to ban pet collars containing diazinon , which was originally developed as a second world war nerve gas			1
@entity21 scientists are studying three cases in which children may have absorbed diazinon , also known as @entity3 , through their skin after repeatedly cuddling or sleeping with pets			1
@entity3 poisoning symptoms include headaches , dizziness , blurred vision , nausea , vomiting , diarrhoea , muscle - twitching , personality changes and loss of co-ordination			1
in extreme cases , it can lead to convulsions , coma and even death – although there is no evidence that flea collars could provide sufficient exposure to cause this			0
last night , @entity52 veterinary director @entity51 said : ‘ we very much welcome @entity2 ’s move to withdraw these collars from the market as a precautionary measure			2
‘ many dog owners will not have been aware of the possible health hazards of using a product containing diazinon and we commend @entity8 for raising awareness of this issue			0
‘ there are safer , equally effective treatments and we see no reason why other manufacturers should n’t follow @entity2 ’s example			0
’ despite the concerns about the collars in @entity21 , @entity73 ’s regulator , the @entity74 , has refused to impose a similar ban			2
it is awaiting a full report from the @entity21 and the results of a separate inquiry by @entity81 vets and medical experts			0
however , @entity73 veterinary sources believe the move by @entity2 will increase pressure on other manufacturers			0
concern : @entity21 experts say children are particularly at risk from collars that contain @entity3 a spokeswoman for the company said it had ‘ received calls from consumers wanting clarification on the potential risk ’			1
she added : ‘ @entity2 is unaware of any adverse reactions in people and all product packaging clearly states that owners should not sleep with pets that are wearing a flea collar			2
‘ however , the concern of pet owners is paramount and we have therefore decided to voluntarily remove these products from our range			1
‘ there are a wide range of safe and effective flea treatments available and we will be working with retailers in the coming weeks to provide alternative products			0
’ a spokeswoman for rival manufacturer @entity116 ’s , which uses diazinon in dog and cat collars , said : ‘ we are not planning to take any action until we have received advice from the regulatory authorities			1
’ industry sources say several hundred thousand of the controversial collars are sold in the @entity73 each year			0
@entity21 ’s veterinary medicines watchdog has published a blacklist of 51 collars that contain diazinon			2
others containing similar toxic chemicals such as propoxur and tetrachlorvinphos have also been withdrawn			0
the decision is being examined by the @entity134			0
the @entity81 said it would consider more detailed information from @entity21 before reviewing the sale of flea collars in other countries .			2

collars contain diazinon which can cause headaches , dizziness , blurred vision and personality changes
