by @entity0 last updated at 10:10 am on 15th february 2012 unlike so many in @entity3 , the @entity1 and @entity2 were finally able to find some way to agree on a compromise for the payroll tax cut that gives about $ 20 a week to average workers			1
lawmakers plan to detail their compromise on wednesday and send it to president @entity10 later this week			1
under the outlines of the emerging agreement , a 2 per cent cut in the @entity12 payroll tax would be extended through the end of the year , with the nearly $ 100billion cost added to the deficit			1
declaring it a potential win : the payroll tax cut and renewing jobless benefits were key planks in president @entity10 's jobs program , which was announced in september jobless benefits for the long - term unemployed would be renewed as well , though they have solved at least a portion of where that $ 30billion total would come from : auctioning broadcast spectrum to wireless companies and requiring federal workers to contribute more toward their pensions			1
@entity33 lawmakers said they were told a tentative pact had been reached but said some details could change before the compromise was finalized			0
they described the session as largely positive , and several predicted the @entity1 would approve the deal			0
the payroll tax cut and renewing jobless benefits were key planks in president @entity10 's jobs program , which was announced in september			1
the payroll tax cut benefits 160 million @entity41 and delivers a tax cut of about $ 20 a week for a typical worker making $ 50,000 a year			1
people making a $ 100,000 salary would get a $ 2,000 tax cut			2
the deal would not only be a win for mr @entity10 but would take the payroll tax fight - which put @entity33 on the defensive - off the table for the fall election campaign			1
on the defensive : ¿ the mood is to get it off the table , ¿ freshman @entity57 representative @entity57 , shown with his trademark taxidermy in the background ‘ the mood is to get it off the table , ’ freshman @entity57 representative @entity57			0
‘ we 've got to move on to another issue			0
’ ‘ it 's a compromise , ’ said fellow @entity33 representative @entity65 , a tea party - backed freshman and one of the bargainers			2
‘ we knew we 'd be making a compromise			0
’ the agreement also would avert a huge cut in @entity76 payments to doctors , financed by cuts elsewhere in the federal health care budget , @entity33 and @entity72 aides said			0
the cuts include a hitting a ‘ prevention fund ’ established under mr @entity10 's health care law aimed at fighting smoking and obesity			2
aides in both parties said @entity87 were rebuffed in an effort to renew a package of expired tax breaks for individuals and businesses , including clean energy tax credits cherished by @entity87 and a tax break sought by businesses that purchase new equipment			0
negotiators agreed to reduce the number of weeks of benefits that workers would be eligible to receive if they lose their jobs			2
¿ it 's a compromise , @entity102 said @entity33 representative @entity65 , a tea party - backed freshman and one of the bargainers the maximum number of weeks of benefits in states with the highest jobless rates would be cut from 99 weeks to 73 weeks by the end of the year			1
and in a win for the @entity114 community , @entity33 would drop a proposal to require that low - income workers who claim a refundable child tax credit be required to have a social security number			0
the proposal was aimed at blocking illegal immigrants from claiming the credit , but the idea created a firestorm among @entity123 who pointed out that many of the children affected by the cut - off are @entity41 citizens			0
republicans also were expected to drop a proposal requiring unemployed people to enrol in @entity132 classes to obtain benefits , and a @entity33 proposal allowing states to employ drug tests as a condition of receiving unemployment benefits would be scrapped as well			0
compromise : the @entity1 and @entity2 have agreed to a deal that allows an extension of the payroll tax cut that said , @entity33 won a provision requiring jobless people to be more diligent in job searches as a condition of receiving benefits			1
tuesday 's developments came just a day after @entity33 leaders announced that they would relent on a demand that the cost of renewing the payroll tax cut be defrayed by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget			1
that made it significantly easier for negotiators to come up with savings to pay for the remaining items			0
president @entity10 weighed in tuesday , urging @entity160 to act immediately to renew both the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits for millions of workers who have been out of work for more than six months			1
‘ just pass this middle - class tax cut			2
pass the extension of unemployment insurance , ’ mr @entity10 said at a @entity166 appearance			2
‘ do it before it 's too late and i will sign it right away			0

the compromise will entail a 2 *%* cut in the @entity12 payroll tax would be extended through the end of the year , with the nearly $ 100billion cost added to the deficit
