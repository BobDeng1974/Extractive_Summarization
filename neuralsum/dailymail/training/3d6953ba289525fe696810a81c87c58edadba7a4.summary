the @entity1 fan club used to seem a little short of members			1
there was sir @entity5 , @entity6 , a handful of @entity9 fans , me … and that was pretty much it			2
but now @entity13 is prepared to let @entity1 leave @entity14 , that little club has grown somewhat			1
it now includes @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , the @entity24 manager			0
all of those well - respected bosses now want the 23 - year - old forward at their clubs , and i have yet to meet a fan of any of these teams who thinks otherwise			0
the @entity1 fan club is swelling fast , and with good reason			1
he is a supreme athlete – extremely fast thanks to his long strides , and strong enough to hold off the toughest defenders in world football			0
anyone who saw him shirtless on @entity50 before the @entity51 will know that his body is the ideal shape for a modern footballer , a physique as impressive even as @entity56 ’s			0
he is also blessed with quick feet , technical agility and ability rarely seen in @entity43 strikers , and the ambition to attempt the audacious – witness his sublime chipped finish on the opening day of last season against @entity64			0
he is a fine link player , plays with his head up , is always looking to bring others into the game and for quick one - twos on the edge of the box			0
bags packed ? @entity1 wants regular starts and could be ready to quit @entity9 to find it @entity74 : @entity1 played a big part in a bright @entity77 performance against @entity78 at the @entity51 strikes : positions from which @entity1 scored his goals in the @entity37 last season he was thrust into the limelight when @entity5 shunted @entity34 aside for the @entity86 quarter - final against @entity87 in february last year , and then dropped his big name star for the second leg			1
@entity9 lost the tie after @entity92 ’s red card but @entity1 scored in the @entity93 and bullied the likes of @entity95 and @entity96			1
a star was born or , at least , it should have been			0
despite that sparkling introduction to the game ’s biggest stage , @entity1 has not established himself at @entity9 and is on the verge of leaving the club			1
he is loved by some @entity9 fans for being a @entity9 born - and - bred product of the youth system , a supporter of the club who never fails to give it all to the cause , even if that means a defensive - minded shift on the left wing			1
other @entity9 fans simply see him as not progressing as a player and another symbol of the @entity117 mess @entity118 finds himself in			1
to many other fans he is a laughing stock , a striker with a woeful goalscoring record who should never be near the @entity77 team			1
the next @entity126 , even ( although this opinion seems to dissipate when @entity1 is linked with their club )			2
bully : @entity1 rises highest to head a goal for @entity9 against @entity87 in february last year blast : @entity1 scored a stunning debut goal for @entity9 from long range against @entity133 in 2008 reach for the sky : the young striker celebrates a strike against @entity137 in the @entity138 in 2009 withdrawn : @entity1 's average position on the pitch last season was behind the main striker it ca n’t be denied that @entity1 ’s goalscoring record is extremely disappointing for an international forward			1
in 117 appearances in the @entity37 over his career to date , he has scored just 26 goals - a strike - rate of 0.2 goals per game with 262 minutes played per goal			2
he can look lost when he sees the whites of goalkeepers ’ eyes – just ask @entity156 after last season ’s @entity86 quarter - final first leg when @entity1 fluffed a glorious one - one - one chance			2
he has also been criticised – most notably by @entity161 on the @entity162 during the @entity51 - for taking the easy options , playing safe passes instead of using his pace , power and vision to punch holes in the opposition			0
all are valid criticisms and @entity1 must improve these areas of the game			0
but how is a striker supposed to become more clinical in front of goal when he is shunted on the wing , seeing even fewer sights of goal , and asked to graft in a role almost more defensive than attacking , as @entity181 asked of him last season ? when @entity181 did play him further as a striker , @entity1 's goals per games ratio dramatically improved , and he scored six goals in six @entity37 matches in a run between december 2013 and january 2014			1
the only way @entity1 will truly realise his potential is to start games , up front or as a no 10 , on a regular basis			2
and he need look no further than @entity193 for proof			0
@entity193 , now 24 , is becoming a superstar at @entity196 following four years in the doldrums at @entity198			0
he too was shunted wide to play in a role that blunted his talents , or as a substitute , cast in the shadow of @entity203 and @entity204 just as @entity1 is with @entity34 and @entity205			0
going nowhere : @entity193 was a lost talent at @entity198 until he moved to @entity196 hotshot : @entity193 is now one of the most feared strikers in the @entity37 and @entity77 's @entity209 at @entity198 , @entity193 scored just 13 times in 63 @entity37 appearances - a strike rate of 0.2 goals per game ( just like @entity1 now ) and averaging a goal every 220 minutes			1
last season he netted 21 goals - behind only @entity217 in the goalscorers ’ charts - and is @entity77 ’s undisputed no 9			2
@entity1 can similarly flourish if given the opportunity elsewhere and that is why his fan club now includes the likes of @entity17			2
@entity225 and their embarrassment of riches apart , @entity1 would improve the strikeforce of every single @entity37 club			1
buy him while you can			0

@entity1 is attracting interest from @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity42 and @entity24
@entity13 is considering letting @entity1 quit @entity9
@entity77 striker has poor goalscoring record but has *enormous* potential
@entity1 could follow in footsteps of @entity193 and develop into top - class @entity37 player after leaving a big club
