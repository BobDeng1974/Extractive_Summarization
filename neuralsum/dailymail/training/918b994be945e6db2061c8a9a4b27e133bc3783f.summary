by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 13:45 est , 16 october 2013 in many families , music can be a calming force which brings people together			0
but at home with @entity8 , the proud owner of more than 100 sets of bagpipes , his hobby has a less harmonious effect			1
the @entity13 police officer has 40 years of piping experience under his belt , and , unluckily for his wife and nine - year - old son , is as enthusiastic as ever			1
enthusiast : @entity8 , 50 , has amassed 105 sets of bagpipes , believed to be the world 's largest collection at home : mr @entity8 's wife , @entity24 , has admitted that she would rather her husband were less of a bagpipe fanatic mr @entity8 , originally of @entity27 on the eastern coast of @entity13 , took up the bagpipes aged ten and racked up plenty of experience by serving in the @entity32 for 24 years			1
the police officer now plays in @entity35 's pipe band , and has established himself as a bagpipe connoisseur with his 105 - strong collection			2
although the @entity39 currently has no entry for the world 's biggest bagpipe collection , it is not believed that mr @entity8 's collection has been outdone , and there are plans for him to be recognised in a future edition			1
his vast , £ 130,000 collection features models which date from as long ago as 1918 , and includes a set of pipes set in gold , silver and ivory worth more than £ 12,000			1
all of his pipes also get a good hearing , as mr @entity8 makes sure to swap his current set every few weeks , and undertakes the mammoth task of cleaning his entire collection every three months			1
long - suffering : the couple said they have ' understanding neighbours ' proud tradition : mr @entity8 's son @entity63 , nine , has yet to take up the passion of his father , who was only ten years old when he started playing resigned : mrs @entity67 said she ' knew what she was getting into ' when she married her husband mr @entity8 's wife @entity70 , 41 , and nine - year - old son , @entity63 , are not great fans of bagpipe music , but have learned to live with his eccentricity			1
mrs @entity67 said : ' it is absolutely ridiculous the amount of bagpipes @entity8 has			2
he can only play one set at once			0
' but i knew when i married him that he came with the bagpipes - i knew what i was getting into			2
' we ’re lucky we ’ve got very understanding neighbours			1
' military man : police officer mr @entity8 used to be a member of the @entity32 , and even visited the pyramids of @entity86 in full regalia , right local character : mr @entity8 says he is known as a bagpipe enthusiast in the local community dedicated : mr @entity8 has dedicated 40 years of his life to bagpiping the keen piper , who uses his talent to raise money for @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 by playing in charity events , also brought relief to his family by finding a more permanent outlet for his enthusiasm by joining @entity106 's pipe band			1
he said : ' since joining the police band i play at home a lot less , which i think my wife appreciates			0
' @entity24 would relish the thought of me selling them all , but there ’s no chance of that happening			2
i ’m too attached to them			0
' life 's work : mr @entity8 says there is ' no chance ' of him ditching the collection , and that whenevr he sells a set of bagpipes he regrets it mr @entity8 said he became inspired by broadcasts of military processions her watched as a child			1
he said : ' i saw @entity131 on the television when i was a kid and thought the bagpipes were amazing			0
' i started playing for the local band and after six months my dad bought me my first set			0
' i have loved and collected bagpipes ever since			0
' as a collector and a musician i am always searching for that very special instrument which has an even better sound			0
expensive kit : mr @entity8 has spent around £ 130,000 on his collection , including a single set of pipes , right , which is worth £ 12,000 ' some of my bagpipes i bought new and some are very old , my oldest set are from 1918 and therefore very rare			1
' i swap pipes every few weeks , so i get to enjoy playing all of my collection			0
' although they ’re all the same size they all vary in ornamentation and quality of sound , i even have a set made from plastic rather than wood			0
' my most valuable set of bagpipes is worth over £ 12,000 , it is set in gold and silver with ancient ivory			2
it has regimental battle honours engraved and the clan crest			0
' i have sold some bagpipes in the past , and i always regret it			0
' @entity8 said : ' in the local community people get to hear about things like this , i have become the bagpipe guy and if somebody is selling some , i ’m usually the first to hear about it			2

@entity8 , 50 , owns 105 different sets of bagpipes , worth £ 130,000
the former @entity32 has played since he was ten years old
mr @entity8 , born in @entity27 , @entity13 , now lives in @entity181 , @entity182
his wife @entity24 and son @entity63 are not the biggest fans of his hobby
but the family are said to have ' understanding neighbours '
