by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is still getting used to the sight of his old team - mate @entity4 in the @entity6 dugout			1
when the @entity8 defender lines up against @entity6 on sunday , @entity4 will be the only familiar face still remaining from his 12 years at the club			1
but @entity11 is just glad he no longer has to try to stop the flying @entity12			0
‘ you would try anything , ’ he said with a laugh			2
' it will be strange , especially seeing him in that coaching role			1
strange : @entity2 says he is still getting used to seeing @entity4 in the @entity6 dugout we meet again : the @entity8 defender lines up against @entity6 on sunday with @entity4 a familiar face ‘ it was weird going down to @entity24 last season and seeing him as the manager			1
it was incredible , you know , but i ’m sure it ’s given him a taste of what ’s to come			0
’ the @entity35 defender was not about to do @entity4 any favours when the latter took temporary charge at @entity6 for four games at the end of last season			1
his first match was a 4 - 0 win against @entity43 but in the second they were up against a @entity8 side scrapping desperately for @entity48 survival , captained by @entity11			1
@entity8 recorded a shock 1 - 0 win that helped keep them up and piled more misery on @entity6 ’s dismal season			1
‘ when we won there it was n’t nice for @entity4 in that sense when he was the manager , but for us it was so crucial for @entity48 survival last season			1
that was a special day , ’ he said			0
@entity11 ’s suggestion that @entity4 will one day become @entity6 manager is perhaps indicative of the new @entity6			1
more than a quarter of a century of stability under sir @entity65 was ripped apart by @entity67 ’s disastrous reign			0
@entity68 has only been at the helm for three months but there is already supporter unrest after their opening day defeat by @entity74 , and that will grow considerably if they do not beat @entity8 on sunday			1
play : @entity2 admits ‘ it was weird going down to @entity24 last season and seeing ( @entity4 ) as the manager ' battle : @entity2 and @entity4 will go head - to - head again on sunday as @entity6 visit the @entity82 it 's not too late to play @entity84			1
there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest - scoring manager but the club are virtually unrecognisable to the one where @entity11 won five league titles , a @entity91 trophy , an @entity92 and three @entity93			2
there is no @entity95 , no @entity96 , no @entity97 or @entity98 , players @entity11 spent almost every day with — in training , on the pitch and travelling the world pillaging silverware			0
‘ they ’ve lost a lot of experience along the way , ’ @entity11 explained			0
‘ it ’s going to be an interesting season , everyone is waiting to see how they ’re doing i ’m sure they ’ll be looking to definitely get back to the top side of the table			2
‘ expectation levels are always sky high and that wo n’t change			2
obviously , after last season , people are saying , “ oh , they need to get to the top four , they need to get this			0
” expectation is always very high , they always expect to be challenging for every trophy and that wo n’t change with last season and with the new rivals along the way			2
‘ they ’ve got a very experienced manager who has been successful wherever he ’s been			2
he looks a great character when he ’s being interviewed			0
he came across very well with the @entity133 team during the @entity134			0
i ’m sure they ’ll be excited they ’ve made one or two additions to their squad			0
’ @entity11 , 33 , has his own new addition this summer with the birth of his daughter , @entity141 , on may 1 , to add to his son @entity142			0
he has n’t let it affect his pre-season preparation , though			0
‘ that is where there is an advantage of being able to shift the family back to @entity150 for a couple of weeks , ’ he added			0
‘ back to see the family and the grandparents			0
’ even without @entity4 in @entity156 ’s the starting @entity155 , or any of the players @entity11 spent those golden years with , he will need to be at his freshest on sunday afternoon			1
once upon a time : @entity6 have somewhat changed since @entity2 's time at the club with players departing eager : @entity2 knows it will be tough because ' expectation levels are always sky high and that wo n’t change '			1

@entity2 and @entity8 face @entity6 on sunday afternoon
the former @entity6 defender says ' it will be strange ' seeing *ex-teammate* @entity4 in a coaching role under new manager @entity68
@entity8 beat @entity6 1 - 0 at @entity24 last season and want to cause an upset again at the @entity82
@entity2 : ‘ when we won there it was n’t nice for @entity4 in that sense when he was the manager , but for us it was so crucial for @entity48 survival '
