by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 20:03 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 03:34 est , 10 may 2013 ambitious plans for a ‘ @entity4 ’ airport were dealt a bitter blow today as a powerful all - party group of mps urged ministers to reject the idea and instead expand @entity10 to three or even four runways			1
as @entity14 ’s busiest airport and the ‘ jewel in the crown ’ of international aviation , expansion at @entity10 is ‘ long overdue ’ and by far the best option after decades of dither by governments of all complexions , they said			1
the prospect of expanding @entity10 by creating two additional runways two miles to the @entity25 – instead of one extra ‘ third ’ runway to the @entity27 - was put forward by @entity28 and @entity29 and has captured the interest and imagination of senior ministers , as well as mps on the committee			1
grounded ? an influential commons select committee has voted against plans for a ' @entity4 ' airport in the @entity39 backers say it they would cost between £ 8billion and £ 12billion and be ready by 2030			1
the @entity33 ’ report notes : ’ relocating the runways in this way might result in less noise annoyance for residents under the current flight path , thus addressing the most politically significant objection to the expansion of @entity10			2
’ but they also encouraged @entity51 to press ahead with plans for a second runway			1
today ’s verdict by the influential @entity55 is uncompromisingly clear noting : ‘ we conclude that a third runway at @entity10 is necessary , but also suggest that a four - runway proposal may have merit			2
’ a brand new airport in the @entity39 to the @entity61 would be too expensive , impractical , harmful to wildlife and ‘ not commercially viable ’ without huge public subsidies , said the @entity33			1
the report was agreed by a majority of the @entity55 with six voting in favour and just one ( @entity70 @entity69 @entity68 mp ) voting against , with no abstentions			2
the findings in the 124 - page report will infuriate residents and campaigners around the @entity77 airport as well as @entity77 mayor @entity78 who supports a brand new airport in the @entity39 already dubbed ‘ @entity4			1
’ but it will delight airlines including the @entity83 ’s flagship carrier @entity82 and the boss of its parent company @entity86 , as well business leaders in the capital			2
the findings will infuriate @entity77 mayor @entity78 who supports the idea of a @entity39 estuary airport the report comes as former @entity95 and @entity94 chief sir @entity93 and his team on the @entity98 - appointed @entity97 continue their investigation into airport capacity			1
the commission is due to present an initial report by the end of this year and a final report in summer 2015 – after the next general election			0
the report says mps on the @entity55 ‘ have today rejected calls for a new hub airport east of @entity77 and urge the government to permit the expansion of @entity10 where a third runway is long overdue			1
’ the verdict was announced by @entity115 , chairman of the @entity116 ’ @entity55 and @entity117 mp for @entity118			0
launching the report of an inquiry that examined the @entity83 @entity110 ’s @entity122 , mrs @entity115 said : ’ @entity10 – the @entity83 ’s only hub airport – has been short of capacity for a decade and is currently operating at full capacity			1
‘ we conclude that a third runway at @entity10 is necessary , but also suggest that a four - runway proposal may have merit , especially if expanding to locate two new runways westwards from the current site could curb the noise experienced by people affected under the flight path			0
’ rejecting the ‘ @entity4 ’ plan for a brand new airport in the @entity39 , mrs @entity115 said : ’ ‘ research we commissioned made plain that building an entirely new hub airport east of @entity77 could not be done without huge public investment in new ground transport infrastructure			1
' evidence to our inquiry also showed a substantial potential impact on wildlife habitat in the @entity39			1
‘ she added : ’ the viability of an estuary hub airport would also require the closure of @entity10 – a course of action that would have unacceptable consequences for individuals , businesses in the vicinity of the existing airport and the local economy			1
’ mps ‘ looked closely ’ at the three main options to increase @entity83 hub airport capacity noting : ’ we conclude that adding new runways to expand a number of other existing airports will not , on its own , provide a long - term solution to the hub capacity problem			2
we do however encourage @entity51 ’s operator to develop a robust business case for their vision of a second runway			0
‘ and the third so - called @entity171 ’ option was rejected as ‘ uncompetetive ’ with mps noting : ’ we reject the notion of linking existing airports by high - speed rail to form a split - hub			0
’ the @entity33 report says @entity110 failures to get a grip of the issue has been ‘ immensely disappointing ’ adding : ’ following decades of policy papers , inquiries , taskforces , and commissions , it is the lack of a long - term cross-party political strategy for aviation that is principally to blame for the very real danger that the @entity83 could lose its status as an international hub for aviation			0
' continuing with a two - runway @entity10 hub ‘ unsustainable ’ because it is not adequate for the needs of the @entity83 concluding ‘ on the basis of the evidence we have heard we recommend that the government allow @entity10 to expand			0
’ it adds : ’ @entity10 is the jewel in the crown of international aviation and we believe that a third runway is long overdue			0
@entity83 businesses are overwhelmingly in favour of this option			0
' jewel in the crown : the committee concluded that a third runway at @entity10 is necessary , but it also suggested that a four - runway proposal may have merit the report said it was ‘ less than ideal ’ that the @entity97 was working to ‘ a protracted timetable , with a final report not to be produced until after the 2015 general election ’			1
to avoid matters being again ‘ kicked into the long grass ’ it challenged the @entity97 to make a decision ‘ once and for all ’			0
in december @entity86 , the feisty boss of @entity82 ' parent company told the @entity33 ’ committee that cowardly politicians have been ‘ too afraid ’ to take tough decisions on airport expansion and that they would live to regret ducking the issue which has already put the @entity83 ‘ out of the game ’ compered to its international rivals			1
today ’s report also calls on the government to establish a national scheme to ensure adequate compensation for people affected by noise from expansion at @entity10			0
it also calls for controversial @entity239 ( @entity239 ) airport departure tax to be reduced or abolished if research suggests it is harmful to the economy or government revenue			1
chancellor @entity243 has admitted it is a revenue raiser not a ‘ green ’ tax as originally billed			0
in the short - term the @entity33 said ministers should introduce an @entity239 ‘ tax holiday ’ for a 12 - month trial period for new services operating from airports outside south east @entity250			0
chancellor @entity243 has admitted the controversial @entity239 airport departure tax is a revenue raiser not a ' green ' tax as originally billed mps also want assurances that the controversial @entity258 high - speed rail line rail network serves @entity10			2
a @entity260 spokesman said the government was ‘ determined to find a lasting solution ’ adding ; ’ the strength and range of opinions expressed on the issue shows precisely why we are right to ask sir @entity93 to conduct a detailed , independent review of all the options , based on the most up - to - date information			0
’ @entity275 transport secretary @entity274 said : ‘ since @entity276 has asked sir @entity93 not to deliver his final report until 2015 , it will be for the next government to decide on the way forward			2
’ @entity10 welcomed @entity33 ’ recognition of the ‘ unique importance ’ of their airport to the @entity83 economy			2
councillor @entity282 , leader of @entity283 in @entity284 , said : ‘ this confirms what we 've always known , and have campaigned loudly about - that the @entity39 airport is a non-starter			1
’ @entity82 said the report ‘ backs up our view that a @entity39 airport is not a credible option ’			1
@entity294 , @entity295 director of external affairs noted the ‘ crippling lack of political consensus around the future of aviation ’ and welcomed the findings as ‘ a breath of fresh air ’			0
@entity303 , chief executive of the @entity304 ( @entity304 ) welcomed ‘ some refreshingly pragmatic and straight forward cross-party thinking ’ which puts the ‘ the national interest first			0
’ @entity307 , senior economic adviser at the @entity308 praised the ‘ hugely positive recommendations on the future of air travel in the @entity83 ’ and said expanding @entity10 ‘ by far the best option ’ adding : ’ we urge the government to accept the committee ’s recommendations			2
’ but @entity317 , chief executive of @entity318 said the focus on a third or even @entity10 runway was ‘ a missed opportunity ’ as he published new research recommending more expansion in the regions : ’ @entity83 ’s great cities need great airports			0
’ @entity328 ’s chief executive @entity327 said any solution will take years but that in the meantime more flights were needed from @entity10 : ‘ we have to make the existing airports work harder			0
