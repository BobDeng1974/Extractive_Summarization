by @entity0 the recent news that animals were abused during wild late night parties at @entity4 is just the most recent example of why animal conservationists may need need to rethink their strategy on keeping animals in captivity			0
zoos across the world vary widely in the standards of welfare they offer creatures , and indeed many people believe that keeping animals in enclosures at all is an outdated concept that should be scrapped			0
but now a group of @entity22 architects has come up with a zoo design that could allow people to safely watch animals , without the creatures ever feeling like they ’re imprisoned			1
the @entity48 design , which is still in its very early stages , has been put forward for the 50 - year - old @entity50 in @entity22 , according to a report by @entity52 in @entity53			1
these continents can be accessed by visitors using ramps , bridges , and tunnels hidden in the ground			1
they would then be able to hide inside shelters , pods and hollowed logs as the animals pass by			1
at the heart of the design is a huge swooping circular plaza that lets people climb up to look down on the parkland			1
this also allows visitors to get access to a trio of the zoo 's three habitats : @entity77 , @entity76 , and the @entity78			1
the entire zoo is ringed by an elevated walkway and a 2.5 mile - long hike connects all three continents			0
particulars of the design are still to be confirmed and its unclear exactly how far the barriers between animals and visitors will be broken down			2
this image suggests the barriers will be minimal , allowing humans to come close to the animals , without the animals feeling like they are being watched in this @entity40 , the humans are hidden from animals in shelters and mirrored pods , while the animals roam around a huge 300 acre complex divided into continents to keep people safe , the architects believe visitors could travel by bike , which would have spherical mirrors attached to keep them hidden on the left is a mock up of what the rock enclosure for penguins would look like , while the right image reveals panda bamboo cottages			1
the entire zoo is ringed by an elevated walkway and a 2.5 mile - long hike connects all three continents it is touted as a wild night out			0
but parties at @entity4 are becoming a little too wild			0
drunken revellers have been taunting and abusing the animals at @entity118 events , which are held on friday nights over the summer			0
incidents include a woman punching a bird , a male pouring beer on a tiger , a reveller stripping off before entering the penguin enclosure and butterflies squashed underfoot			0
there are also claims that a drunken woman tried to get into the lion enclosure.the animals are said to have been disturbed by loud noise and flash photography at the parties			0
to keep people safe , the architects believe visitors could travel by bike , which would have spherical mirrors attached to keep them hidden			2
other ideas include having huge spheres hung from tension cables over bears , lions and or travelling by boat alongside elephants			0
‘ we must make sure that our cities offer a generous framework for different people – from different backgrounds , economy , gender , culture , education and age – so they can live together in harmony while taking into account individual needs as well as the common good , ’ the company writes on its website			0
‘ nowhere is this challenge more acrimonious than in a zoo			0
' it is our dream – with @entity50 – to create the best possible and freest possible environment for the animals ' lives and relationships with each other and visitors			2
’ others particulars of the design are still to be confirmed and its unclear exactly how far the barriers between animals and visitors will be broken down			2
the design is currently early initial master plan for an overhaul of the part that 's scheduled to be completed by 2019			2

the design is currently early initial master plan for an overhaul of the part that 's scheduled to be completed by 2019 @entity50 is a zoo and safari park in @entity239 , 20 kilometres north west of @entity240 in @entity22			1
the park opened in 1969 under the name of ' @entity50 '			0

@entity22 architects , @entity48 , came up with the concept design as part of the overhaul of @entity50
300 acre complex is divided into continents - @entity77 , @entity76 , and the @entity78 - with a huge circular plaza at its centre
each continent can be accessed by visitors using a maze of ramps , bridges , and tunnels hidden in the ground
visitors can travel by bike , foot or boat , and hide inside shelters , pods and hollowed logs as the animals pass by
