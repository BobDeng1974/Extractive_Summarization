pumping his arms , pointing his index finger and gesturing with his hands , president @entity1 's body language at last night 's @entity3 speech was anything but conciliatory			1
although he admitted having flaws and promised to seek @entity10 ideas , he deliberately avoided giving the impression that the balance of power in @entity13 had shifted away from the @entity14 that he will occupy for two more years			1
@entity1 gave his hour - long , annual @entity3 address yesterday to the first fully @entity10 - controlled @entity16 of his presidency , and the mood was anything but conciliatory			1
that did not sit well with the competitive president , who ad - libbed immediately : ' i know ' cause i won both of ' em. ' @entity1 won the @entity31 in 2008 and 2012 , but @entity10 won a majority in both houses of @entity16 in 2014			1
the president acknowledged that with a host of veto threats in his speech			1
he also spiced up his remarks with a wish that the government not ' screw things up ' on the economy			0
the phrase did not appear in his prepared remarks			0
@entity1 's body language and verbal barbs were not the only theatrics on display			1
@entity10 @entity50 @entity49 , who sat behind @entity1 , kept a serious look on his face for much of the night			2
vice president @entity53 , who sat beside @entity49 , looked giddy , blowing a kiss to his wife , @entity56 , who sat in the balcony with first lady @entity58			0
@entity59 played a key role in the speech and its long rollout			0
the @entity31 began announcing the key policy proposals from the address two weeks ago , getting the ' news ' out in the open before the big night			0
then some 15 minutes before @entity1 started speaking , the @entity31 deliberately broke its own embargo , posting a copy of @entity1 's remarks online for all to see			1
the president 's body language revealed he was determined not to give the impression the balance of power had not shifted away from the @entity14 @entity1 's speech was littered with ad - libbed barbs directed at the @entity10 congress members of @entity16 sit stony - faced as the president delivers his @entity3 speech the @entity31 website also featured a movie - like trailer complete with a soundtrack , hashtags and reference to @entity53 's infamous expletive when the president signed healthcare reform into law : ' it 's a bfd			1
' translation , minus the bad word : @entity93 ( freaking ) deal			0
back in the chamber , lawmakers engaged in the obligatory ritual of standing and applauding when they agreed with the president 's words , or sitting grim - faced when they did not			2
some waved pencils in solidarity with the victims of the recent shootings at a satirical newspaper in @entity107			0
@entity108 , recently freed from a @entity110 jail , mouthed : ' thank you , thank you ' to @entity1 when the president addressed him with ' welcome home , @entity114			2
' spots of color jazzed up the chamber , mostly via female lawmakers ' outfits			0
but @entity1 wore a dark suit and signature blue tie , despite an adviser 's joke on @entity125 suggesting that he had donned the tan number that garnered immense attention when he wore it at a @entity31 briefing last year .			2

@entity1 's body language avoided impression balance of power has shifted
he gave his @entity3 address to @entity10 - controlled @entity16
but he *refrained* from being conciliatory with *defiant* gestures and barbs
contained within his speech were a host of threats to use veto powers
