by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 10:37 est , 26 february 2013 a group of young @entity3 inventors are poised to carry flight tests of the world 's first winged jetpack that can take off from the ground			2
@entity8 and his friends from @entity10 have spent more than five years so far developing their one - man , jet - propelled wing			1
once completed , the backpack - mounted aircraft , dubbed @entity15 , will be the smallest twin - engined aeroplane ever built and could herald a new era of personal air travel			1
and unlike the jet packs made famous by @entity33 , the @entity15 will be able to take off from the ground instead of being dropped from an aircraft			1
although mr @entity8 has been a pilot since the age of 14 , he has always dreamed of flying without the encumbrance of a plane or glider , @entity36 reports			2
the @entity15 's design is said to be based on the wings of the condor , large broad - winged soaring birds which are able to alter their wing structure to exploit variable wind conditions in their mountainous habitat			1
accordingly , the wings on the @entity15 are composed of three units that separate for more surface area to provide lift on take off then contract in flight for greater speed and stability			1
similar technology is already used on a much larger scale in modern jet airliners			0
poised : the wings on the @entity15 are composed of three units that separate for more surface area to provide lift on take off then contract in flight for greater speed and stability @entity15 is powered by dual microturbine diesel jet engines built into the so - called ' @entity65 ' backpack section , which also holds the flight computer and control electronics			1
before take - off the pilot puts on the @entity65 like a backpack and fastens it to himself , before presumably enlisting a helper to attach the wings , which also contain the fuel tanks , using a quick release system			2
across his front sits the landing gear , which has four 10in off - road tires the @entity15 team claim is ' able to cope with potholed grass runways '			1
schematic : the team behind @entity15 say that it should be able to hit top speeds of more than 200mph , with a flight ceiling of 26,000ft , easily steered by the movement of the pilot 's body with one eye on the cost , the @entity15 team have built their revolutionary aircraft from aviation plywood , which has also enabled them to keep its empty weight down to 55lbs			1
controlling the @entity15 is achieved via an 8in graphical user interface attached to the flight computer and a throttle in the pilot 's right hand that looks like those which come with cheap remote control cars			1
once in the air , the pilot steers the @entity15 by shifting his body weight			1
the angle of climb is controlled by bending your knees to dip your boots into the exhaust - similar to the control vanes on a @entity111 rocket			2
homebrew : a team of young inventors from @entity10 , @entity3 , have been working on @entity15 for more than five years light : with one eye on the cost , the @entity15 team have built their revolutionary aircraft from aviation plywood , which has also enabled them to keep its empty weight down to 55lbs the @entity15 team say on the project 's website : ' our dream is a totally unlimited flying between the clouds			1
glide with your own body ... let yourself merge with the wings			0
' two microjets let you speed through the sky with more than 200 miles per hour			2
' the @entity15 shall be easily transported to your local airstrip and put together there with just a few strokes of work			1
' you take off lying comfortably on your 10in off - road landing gear			2
after just a few moments you get airborne , harvesting the power of the two turbojet engines working in your back			0
' now everything responds to the actions of your body			0
a slight motion of your finger accelerates			0
outstretching your arm starts a turn			0
finally bend your knees and accelerate skywards			0
' they add : ' landing works the same way you took off			0
but until that moment has come , you share boundless freedom with nothing but the clouds and the limitless sky			0
' in case of an emergency you land safely using your total recovery parachute system			0
' working for this idea is the greatest pleasure of our lives which we work for more than five years now			0
please follow us if you share this aviational dream ! ' find out more about the kit here			0

once completed , @entity15 will be the smallest twin - engined plane ever built
it will have a top speed of more than 200mph and ceiling of 26,000ft
