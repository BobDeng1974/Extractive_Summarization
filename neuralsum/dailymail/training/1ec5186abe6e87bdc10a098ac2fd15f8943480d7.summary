by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor , in @entity2 , @entity3 @entity1 senators told @entity5 during a weekend presidential candidate cattle - call that attorney general @entity9 's credibility is on its last legs , that he owes one @entity12 lawmaker an apology , and that it 's time for his exit if he wo n't indict a corrupt @entity17 administration official @entity9 has frayed the @entity12 's collective nerves in the past two years , presiding over what they see as a wall of silence that impedes congressional oversight and gives a middle finger to legislators ' lawful subpoenas for tens of thousands of documents			1
last week the @entity28 passed a resolution calling on the whole @entity28 to vote @entity30 , a former @entity31 official , in contempt of @entity33 for her refusal to answer questions about her role in a scheme to play political favorites with her agency			1
if @entity9 refuses @entity33 ' demand to indict her , @entity41 sen. @entity40 told @entity5 , it 's time for him to resign			1
' yes , ' he said			0
' @entity45 : attorney general @entity9 delivered a ' disrespectful ' verbal slap to a @entity12 congressman last week , said sen. @entity48 , and he should apologize ' absolutely ' : sen. @entity40 said without hesitation that @entity9 should resign his office if he refuses to indict former @entity31 official @entity30 following a contempt of @entity33 resolution in the @entity28 @entity55 sen. @entity48 told @entity5 that @entity9 deserves a ' mulligan ' for his outburst last week , but he first owes congressman @entity58 of @entity41 a sincere apology @entity30 allegedly orchestrated a plan to prevent the approvals of tax - exempt statuses for conservative tea party groups in the run - up to the 2010 congressional elections			1
that move hampered their ability to raise funds and participate in the election season with ad - buys and other independent expenditures			0
if @entity9 is the proverbial cat with nine political lives , he 's used up eight of them with the @entity12			1
and his appearance last week before the @entity79 has @entity40 's colleague , @entity55 sen. @entity48 , demanding an apology			2
the attorney general snapped at rep. @entity58 during the april 8 hearing when the former @entity41 chief justice claimed @entity9 did n't take seriously a 2012 @entity28 vote holding him in criminal contempt for clinging to documents related to the @entity89 gunrunning scandal			1
' you do n't want to go there , buddy , ' @entity9 told him			1
on saturday at the site of the first @entity3 @entity94 in the city of @entity2 , @entity48 told @entity5 that @entity9 's outburst ' was disrespectful			1
' ' now look – everybody makes mistakes			0
everyone 's entitled to a mulligan now and then , ' he said			0
' i hope that it was just a mistake			0
and if it was , then i 'm sure @entity9 should issue an apology			2
' but ' it would be much better , ' he added , ' if @entity9 and the @entity106 just complied with the @entity28 's requests			1
they should n't go there			2
' contempt : @entity41 @entity12 rep. @entity58 slammed @entity9 in a @entity28 hearing , saying a congressional vote of contempt was apparently ' not a big deal to our attorney general ' friendly terrtory : the 2014 @entity3 @entity94 was a gathering of tea party - affiliated conservative lawmakers and other potential future candidates , making swag like an anti-hillary @entity124 ' stress ball ' popular items sen. @entity126 said @entity9 should be -- but is n't -- an ' independent ' investigator , even though he 's an @entity17 political appointee with loyalty to the @entity28 @entity131 sen. @entity126 , who along with @entity40 is seen as a @entity12 presidential front - runner for 2016 , said he understands the tightrope @entity9 has to walk , even if he does n't like the result			1
body slam : @entity41 @entity136 rep. @entity136 said during the same @entity138 hearing that @entity9 should be ' in jail ' for contempt of @entity33 ' it is a pretty big question ' whether congressional subpoenas still have any teeth , ' he said			1
a @entity1 attorney general ' should be an independent agent			0
that 's what they 're supposed to be , ' @entity126 told @entity5			0
' but it 's hard because he 's also a political appointee			0
' should @entity9 go if he does n't indict @entity30 following a contempt citation from the @entity28 ? ' i do n't know the answer to that , ' @entity126 conceded			1
' i really do n't know exactly what will happen			0
' @entity48 seconded that note of caution			0
' it 's going to be a very interesting thing , ' the @entity55 said			0
' i 'm watching that one very closely			0
' @entity126 gave @entity30 no such leeway , however			2
' @entity30 was a government employee and is still receiving a government pension			2
she should cooperate in a government investigation , ' he said of her refusal – twice – to answer the @entity28 's questions			2
' everything should be done to find justice			0
i think it upsets a lot of people , @entity12 or @entity169 , if government is being used to punish political enemies			2

@entity9 exploded last week at a @entity12 congressman during an open hearing when a 2012 criminal contempt vote against him was raised
' you do n't want to go there , buddy , ' he snapped at rep. @entity58 , bringing one senator to demand an apology on saturday
a former @entity31 official now faces her own @entity28 contempt vote , setting up a *showdown* between the @entity12 and @entity9 , who has the power to indict her
@entity12 lawmakers are losing *patience* with him and another senator said he should quit if he wo n't charge @entity30 with a crime
