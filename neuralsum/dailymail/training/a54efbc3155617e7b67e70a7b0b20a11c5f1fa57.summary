by @entity0 there are some bizarre friendships in the animal world and probably none more bizarre than that between a green tree frog and a snail			0
the unlikely pair living in @entity9 , @entity10 and the frog is a pet belonging to photographer @entity13 , 50			1
mr @entity13 went into his outdoor studio to take some pics of his pet frog when he saw the snail approaching the amphibian as it sat on a tree branch			1
@entity20 and easy does it : the snail approaches the green tree frog the snail reaches out as the frog seems happy to give the mollusc a helping head he was shocked when the frog lowered its body so the snail could slither up and onto its head where it perched happily , and the new friends even posed for photographs			0
' this green tree frog is my own frog and on this occasion i went outside to try and snap some nice photographs of him enjoying the sun , â€™ said mr @entity13			2
