she said : ‘ i 've been aware that i 've been different since i was a teenager because my legs were larger			1
i developed anorexia and bulimia and exercised obsessively because i thought i could shrink my legs			1

since the pregnancy , the pain has continued ms @entity5 says that when she was at school she was bullied because of the size of her legs			1

the only treatment known to work is called tumescent liposuction but this is not available on the @entity101			2
it involves numbing the legs before removing the excess fat			2
this treatment has been shown to be highly effective and has good long - term results			2

sometimes i was left looking like a leopard , because i was covered in patches of bruises			0
’ after several months of gp appointments , ms @entity5 was finally diagnosed with lipoedema in april 2011			1
she said : ‘ it was a bitter - sweet experience , being diagnosed			2
up to that point , the only advice i 'd ever been given was “ eat less , exercise more ” , which had made absolutely no difference			0
‘ i was relieved to know what it was , but it was a blow to be told that it was incurable			2
’ today , ms @entity5 is registered disabled and manages her pain with a pneumatic compression pump and practices simple lymphatic drainage massage at home			1
she regularly attends a pain clinic near her home in @entity152 , @entity153			1

although millions of women have lipoedema , it 's not often talked about			0
‘ it 's passed on genetically			0
my mother has it , although fortunately she does n't suffer with pain			0
‘ i feel sad not to be able to play with @entity44 as much			1
sometimes i have to cut playtime short and sit him in front of the tv and wait for the pain to subside			0

she said : ‘ i hope the surgery will make a big difference			0
after i had @entity44 i decided that enough was enough			2
ms @entity5 knows her condition is incurable so she now wants to encourage other sufferers to talk about the condition rather than to suffer in silence			1
pictures show the swelling in her legs ‘ i am an administrator on a private @entity205 page for sufferers which has 400 members and i helped to launch an organisation , @entity208 which runs a busy forum , which is a good resource for people looking for answers and support			1
