swingers : @entity20 , left , and @entity8 , right , ( both pictured outside court ) are jointly accused of assault by spraying bear mace at @entity10 when their consensual sex session turned nasty the pair , of @entity27 , @entity28 , had picked mr @entity10 up and taken him back to their secluded cottage on the friday evening and he was supposed to spend the weekend with the couple			1
however in the early hours of sunday morning the romp turned ugly when mr @entity10 refused to let @entity7 take a picture of him on his mobile phone			1
@entity35 handed her partner a can of @entity40 deterrent spray and he released the chemical into mr @entity10 's face			1
he fled the house in agony and was found running down a road by a lorry driver and the police were called			1

bear repellant is similar to the pepper spray sold as ' mace ' in the @entity74 , used for fending off attackers			0
@entity40 – one of the most popular @entity78 brands – uses hot pepper plants as an ingredient and is extremely powerful			2
the manufacturers warn that it is not for use on humans , as it can cause intense pain if sprayed into the eyes			0
a normal canister is designed to spray a heavy fog up to 40 yards away – so if it is fired too close to a human eyeball , the force of the discharge can cause pressure injuries			0
the spray itself also works by irritating the mucous membranes of the eyes , causing pain and the production of tears			0
it also causes coughing and sneezing			0
the only treatment is to seek fresh air immediately and blink repeatedly to cleanse the eye			0

' mr @entity7 had been up with very little sleep from friday to sunday			2
