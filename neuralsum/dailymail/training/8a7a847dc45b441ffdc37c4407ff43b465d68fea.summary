by @entity0 with a @entity3 cruise with friends booked for november and a job she loves , @entity1 , 31 , considers herself lucky			1
but the @entity7 - born naturalised @entity6 has struggled all her life with a condition that is slowly turning her muscles into solid bone - and has already cost her her right arm			1
now , the 31 - year - old is hoping to experience as much of life as she can before her muscles seize up for good			1
brave : @entity1 ( right ) is slowly losing her ability to move thanks to a disease turning her muscles into bone lucky : @entity1 , who has already lost an arm to the condition , says she is happy her jaw has n't locked @entity1 is one of an estimated 700 people worldwide with @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , an incurable disease sometimes known as ' stone man syndrome ' because its devastating effects can leave sufferers completely immobilised , like living statues			1
' my condition has made me who i am - an optimistic person with an inner strength and determination to succeed , ' said @entity1			1
' if i want to do something , then i normally find a way to do it			0
i do n't know how much longer i will have movement in my body , so i want to experience as much as i can now			2
' in other cases of @entity24 people have frozen solid , their jaws locking shut			1
they ca n't move and have to talk through their teeth long before they get to my age			0
so i actually feel extremely lucky			2
' the condition arises from a mutation of the body 's repair mechanism which causes muscles , tendons and ligaments to convert to bone material when damaged			2
@entity1 , whose mother @entity55 emigrated to @entity56 from @entity57 in @entity7 before she was born , was diagnosed with the condition when she was three years old - six months after her right arm was amputated by surgeons who wrongly suspected she had cancer			1
childhood : @entity1 , pictured with her mother @entity55 , was initially diagnosed with cancer at the age of three ambassador : @entity1 now hopes to raise awareness of her condition and met the @entity69 in 2007 ' during my childhood my mobility was fine , because i was still young , ' she added			1
' but i was quite unhappy			0
i felt very different from the other children at school , and i did n't have many friends			0
i was quite shy and kept myself to myself			0
it was n't much of a life			2
' her symptoms first began to show when she was a teenager , with gradual muscle stiffening accelerating as she grew older			0
' i began to feel my body stiffen gradually			0
i knew i was finally facing the onset of the condition , ' she remembers			0
' i 'd been told what was going to happen , and feeling the first symptoms made me want to experience everything life had to offer - before it was too late			0
' she married @entity91 , 31 , a man she met online , but the pair divorced in 2005 after three years of marriage			0
' i 'm still on good terms with @entity91 and i look back on our time together with nothing but fondness , ' says @entity1			2
video source @entity98 achievement : @entity1 was able to complete a five kilometre surfing course using a specially adapted board proud : @entity1 wants to do as much as she possibly can before her ability to move is completely lost ' walking down the aisle , with full use of my limbs , was one of the happiest days of my life , and no one can take that memory away from me			1
' despite her happy memories , in may 2006 , @entity1 's life took a turn for the worse after she was involved in a serious car crash			1
she escaped without any broken bones but her right leg took a heavy impact			0
' my doctor warned me that just the slightest bump could trigger the @entity24 to take hold			2
after the smash i fully expected my leg to freeze up permanently , ' said @entity1			1
' one of my worst fears was that my body would fuse upright , meaning i 'd never be able to sit again			0
' when my leg locked in a standing position i was sure i was facing a worst - case scenario			0
luckily when the swelling went down i was able to bend the leg slightly			0
' i spent a lot of time sitting in the hope it would fuse in that position			0
at least then i could sit in a wheelchair and be wheeled around			0
' her leg locked into a bent position permanently in may 2007 , and @entity1 was fitted with a special platform shoe to help her maintain as much mobility as possible			1
since the setback , @entity1 has been determined to do more with her life and so far , has learned to surf and completed a five kilometre course in a specially - adapted wheelchair in august last year			1
she has also become a full - time ambassador for amputees and families affected by the @entity24 and in december she is going on a @entity3 cruise with 100 friends who are amputees			1
' i 've been blessed to meet so many truly amazing people , especially the @entity69 - that was a real honour , ' said @entity1 of the religious leader , whom she met in 2007			1
' i feel so humbled that so many people have taken an interest , and hopefully found some inspiration , in my life			2

@entity1 , 31 , suffers from @entity24
just 700 people worldwide have the illness which turns muscle to bone
she has already lost an arm and the movement in one leg to the condition
nevertheless , she says she is lucky and is trying to live life to the full
