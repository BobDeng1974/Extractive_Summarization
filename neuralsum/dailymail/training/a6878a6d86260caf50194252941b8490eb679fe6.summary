controversial : the 85 mph speed limit has been approved for a 41 - mile - long toll road near the increasingly crowded @entity10 corridor between @entity11 and @entity12 ' the research is clear that when speed limits go up , fatalities go up , ' said @entity29 , a spokesman for the nonprofit @entity30			1
higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster , @entity29 said , ' but the trade - off is more crashes and more highway deaths			1
' a 2009 report in the @entity38 studied traffic fatalities in the @entity40 from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads			1
the study also said that rural highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where speed limits were raised , but did not cite specific numbers in those instances			1
most highways in the @entity40 top out at 75 mph , and there are no longer any roads in the @entity40 with no speed limit like @entity60 's autobahn			1
some highways in rural @entity62 and @entity63 have 80 mph speed limits			1
the @entity65 last year approved 85 mph limits for some new stretches of road			2

a transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment on their decision			0
@entity80 speeds : @entity81 shows top speed limits across the @entity40 agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road 's topography , the speeds that most drivers were reaching , and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit			1
' safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one , ' agency spokeswoman @entity91 said			2
@entity98 , who lives in @entity11 and regularly drives to @entity71 to visit family , said he 'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast			0
' i would love it , ' @entity98 said			0
' sometimes it 's fun to just open it up			0
' @entity107 sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from @entity111 , north of @entity11 , to his job in @entity12			0
the section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit			1
@entity115 said he 'd be comfortable driving 85 , but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition			0
' a tire blowout ( at 85 mph ) could be a big hazard , ' @entity115 said			0
@entity122 , spokesman for @entity123 that is building the road , said the company is committed to operating a safe highway			0
' on any road , drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic , travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles , ' @entity122 said			0
toll prices have not yet been set for the new section			0
