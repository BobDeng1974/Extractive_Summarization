@entity0 shot to fame as the glamorous girlfriend of @entity3 on hit reality show made in @entity6			1
since leaving the @entity8 show that propelled her to fame , @entity0 has been quietly building up her brand and she 's got big plans for the future			1
the latest string to the model and presenter 's bow ? a range of stylish bangles inspired by her hometown of @entity6			1
@entity0 , who models the range herself in a set of smouldering campaign shots , opened up to @entity40 about her brainchild , turbulent time on made in @entity6 and her battle with depression			1
speaking about @entity30 , she said : ' we came up with the concept after realising how passionate people are about their own pockets of @entity48			0
we decided on postcodes because because they ’re quintessentially @entity51 , are so unique to see on jewellery , and they evoke a thousand memories			0
' each person has their own memories built into different areas and we wanted to allow people to celebrate their own stories and wear their heart on their wrist			0
' at the same time as celebrating our communities we also want to support them and so we donate £ 1 of every bangle sale to @entity66 , a charity that helps homeless and vulnerable people			2
' get the @entity6 look : speaking about @entity30 , a range of postcode bangles , she said : ' we came up with the concept after realising how passionate people are about their own pockets of @entity48 ' business brains : @entity0 established @entity30 with her friends @entity33 and @entity35 @entity0 's bangles are loved by @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , and even @entity80 - but the star would love to see @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 donning her designs			1
@entity0 , who also works in presenting and would love to design her own footwear range , is a huge fan of fashion , which is clear from her latest campaign			1
speaking about her personal style , she said : ' i 've been told my style is " hobo chic " - very low effort , a little bit bohemian			0
i would say i just wear what i like , and my style changes according to my mood			0
' her mood , in particular her battle with depression , is something @entity0 has spoken publicly about			1
' it 's been something i 've struggled with to some degree since i was about fifteen , ' she said candidly			2
' but being on the show definitely accentuated it			1
' celebrity favourite : the bangles are loved by @entity77 , @entity78 and even @entity80 - but the star would love to see @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 donning her designs she continued : ' i 'm so grateful to the show but i found it very difficult to have a relationship breakdown on television			1
' the show was great to be a part of , and was full of highs and lows			2
the highs were incredible , and the lows were awful			0
i have very chilled out friends so i was n't quite prepared for the drama			2
'' i 'm in a really good place now though , the best i 've ever been ; i think i 've finally learnt to cope with it			0
' i 'm really busy at the moment and am still in touch with the people i care about on the show so i do n't miss it			2
i doubt i 'd ever go back to it but @entity133 taught me to @entity134 say never			0
opening up : @entity0 has previously spoken about her battle with depression but says she 's in a really good place now @entity0 is most certainly seizing all the opportunities that come her way , promising that 2015 is going to be a ' huge ' year for her			1
' there 's lots of exciting things in the pipeline with our bangle company , as well as a few big modelling campaigns , and i 'll be back on tv screens ! i ca n't say too much at the moment , ' she said			1
despite her hectic work schedule , her @entity150 's resolution is ' learn to take time off '			2
' i 'm a bit of a workaholic , i 've been known to work 18 hour days - that 's the trouble with being self employed there 's no one to send you home , ' she said			0
' i also want to be a bit more selfish			0
i sometimes try so hard to make others happy that i forget about myself			0
' sharing her plans for the future , ambitious @entity0 said : ' in five years time i hope that i 'm happy and successful			1
i 'd like to be a regular face for presenting work , my dream job is to do this morning but whether it takes five years or 15 years , i know it 's just a case of working hard			2
' my friend @entity168 and i always joke we are the next @entity170 and @entity83 so maybe we 'll have our own panel show , too			0
' i 'm really passionate about women 's health , both in terms of mental health and healthy body image , so i 'd quite like to explore that passion too			0
who knows , as long as i 'm happy i do n't mind			0
' wear your postcode on your sleeve : the bangles , which can be personalised , are priced at around £ 69 , with a portion going to charity stylish star : @entity0 describes her personal style as ' hobo chic ' - very low effort and a little bit bohemian - and would love to develop her own footwear range			1
