a study has found that those who had sipped alcohol by the age of 11 were five times more likely to have had a full drink within a couple of years , and four times more likely to have binged or been drunk than peers who had not tasted alcohol at an early age			1
the study was carried out in the @entity23 where , say researchers , some parents try to lessen the taboo appeal of drinking by following the ‘ @entity27 model ’ of introducing young children to alcohol under supervision at home			1
lead researcher @entity32 , of @entity33 in @entity34 , said : ‘ our study provides evidence to the contrary			2
’ previous research suggests parental attitudes are one of the most important factors involved in when teens start drinking			0
a survey of @entity46 schoolchildren found witnessing drinking at home and seeing their parents get drunk raises the risk of children having an alcoholic drink by the age of 13			1
in the @entity23 study , 561 @entity34 middle - school students were surveyed periodically over three years			1
at the beginning of sixth grade – around the age of 11 – almost 30 per cent of pupils said they had sipped alcohol			2
in most cases , their parents provided it – often at a party or other special occasion			2
by the time the students reached the ages of 14 and 15 , one in four early ‘ sippers ’ said they had had a full alcoholic drink , compared with 6 per cent of those who had not			1
almost one in ten of early sippers had got drunk or binged – compared with just under 2 per cent of ‘ non-sippers ’ , says a report in the @entity74			2
researchers accounted for several factors which influence under - age drinking , including parents ’ drinking habits and any history of alcoholism , as well as tendencies among the children to be impulsive and take risks			1
even then there was still a connection between early sipping and risky drinking by high school , said dr @entity90			2
she said it was possible little tastes of alcohol sent young children a mixed message because some may have difficulty understanding the difference between a sip of wine and having a full drink			1
she stressed parents should not be alarmed if they had already let their child have a taste of wine , adding : ‘ we ’re not saying your child is doomed			0
