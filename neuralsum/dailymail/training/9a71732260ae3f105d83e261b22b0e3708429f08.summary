@entity1 striker @entity0 is refusing to hide as he attempts to end his goal drought			1
the 29 - year - old frontman is yet to open his account in 20 appearances for the club , but has forced his way back into contention in recent weeks and is desperate to address that situation			1
@entity0 told the @entity10 : ' it would be massive [ to get that first goal ]			2
obviously , as a striker you want to be scoring goals and doing well for your football club , but that 's not been the case so far for me			2
@entity0 is desperate to end his goal drought at @entity1 now he is back in the first - team picture @entity0 ( left ) was part of the @entity1 side that lost 2 - 0 to @entity25 @entity24 in the @entity26 ' i know that , i 'm not going to hide			1
it 's up to me to work hard and make sure i get in the positions and not shy away from an opportunity when it comes my way			2
' once one goes in , i 'm sure a lot more will follow			0
the first goal would be nice , but the most important thing is the team - we need to pick up points and make sure we 're not going to struggle come the end of the season			0
' former @entity40 trainee @entity0 arrived at the @entity41 in a £ 5million switch from @entity43 in january 2013 under then - manager @entity44 , but having failed to find the back of the net in 13 appearances at the end of that campaign , during which the @entity51 boss was relieved of his duties , he became surplus to requirements			1
the former @entity43 striker 's £ 5million move has n't worked out so far , with no goals to show indeed , he spent the whole of last season on loan , initially at @entity61 and then @entity40 , and joined @entity62 on a similar basis for two months earlier in the current campaign			1
however , his return in january and the subsequent arrival of @entity67 have given him a new lease of life on @entity70 , and he is relishing the prospect of competing with @entity72 and @entity73 to partner the @entity76 international once the newcomer shakes of a calf injury			0
@entity72 is in direct competition with @entity0 for a place in @entity81 's starting line - up @entity73 is another @entity1 striker that stands in the way of @entity0 's first - team hopes @entity0 said : ' we 're all starting from the same place			1
all four strikers will be playing at different times and we all bring different things to the team			0
' but @entity67 has given everyone around the place a lift			0
you can see that if he gets one chance , he will more than likely put it away and that 's what we 've been missing			0
' to have a player of his calibre at the football club is massive and it 's going to help us			0
everyone wants to play up front with him and help him and the team do well			0
' @entity0 feels that january signing @entity67 has given @entity1 a lift - and he wants to play with him			1

@entity0 has not scored since his £ 5million move two years *ago*
loans at @entity61 , @entity40 and @entity62 have not led to him leaving
but now the *forward* is back in contention under @entity81 at @entity1
