@entity4 deputy leader @entity7 , her husband , home affairs spokesman @entity9 and former health secretary @entity10 were key figures in the @entity12 when it forged extraordinary links with the notorious @entity15			1
the trio refuse to comment on the @entity12 ’s activities or apologise for the organisation ’s support for @entity15 , which openly campaigned to legalise child sex			1
power couple : mps @entity9 and @entity7 , who married in 1982 , rose from the @entity12 to the highest echelons of the @entity23 commenting on this paper ’s investigation into the @entity4 trio ’s links with @entity15 , media expert @entity24 , a former editor of the @entity25 , said yesterday : ‘ i ’m with the @entity30 on this			1
' on the basis of the paper ’s evidence , i think @entity35 , @entity9 and @entity10 do need to address this matter seriously			1
’ @entity24 wrote in his blog for the left - leaning @entity39 newspaper : ‘ it is n’t good enough to say the world was different then ( as some have been suggesting in relation to the recent crop of historic sex abuse court cases ) , because there has never been a time when it has been all right to advocate sex with a child			0
’ high profile : former health minister @entity10 now enjoys a lucrative £ 160,000 a year part - time job working for @entity53 after she retired from @entity54 and @entity55 , chief executive of the @entity56 in @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , said : ‘ an apology is the very least they could do			1
' many , many children were abused by @entity15 members and staff			1
‘ and many other abusers were encouraged in their crimes by the propaganda put about by that thoroughly disgusting organisation			0
' despite this fact , @entity35 , @entity10 and @entity68 ’s @entity12 legitimised the pie , and acted as apologists for it during the 1970s and 1980s			1
' and that really is inexcusable , whatever social norms or values were current at the time			0
’ the @entity30 investigation has revealed shocking links between the @entity4 figures and @entity15 , a group of predatory paedophiles calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four			2
politicians last night put more pressure on @entity35 , mr @entity9 and miss @entity10 to come clean about their links with @entity15			1
@entity83 mp @entity82 , a member of the panel of senior mps advising @entity86 on policy , said : ‘ it ’s hard to understand why there has been no response			0
‘ these are very serious allegations , and a full and frank statement is now needed , otherwise this worrying situation could drag on , which is in the interests of no one			0
’ former @entity83 mp @entity96 added : ‘ they should apologise			0
i am in no doubt that what they did at the time was because there may have been a different mindset , but they should at least acknowledge that			0
‘ these views are utterly appalling , and that is what most of us thought in the 1970s			0
‘ i remember the controversy at the time when the @entity15 affiliated to the @entity12			2
it ’s not as if people thought it was ok in the 1970s			0
big players : @entity7 once legal officer of the @entity12 , now @entity4 deputy leader and husband @entity9 , right , a left - wing firebrand , now a shadow minister ‘ the @entity23 have been critical of the @entity119 and the @entity120 , so why are they not being critical of their own ? ’ @entity83 mp sir @entity121 , who has campaigned to tighten the law on child pornography , said : ‘ i just find it absolutely extraordinary			1
@entity10 : general secretary of the @entity12 , later @entity4 minister under @entity126 and mp for @entity128 either they did n’t know or did n’t find out , but if they did know it is appalling			2
i think an explanation is due			0
’ police are investigating the paedophile group as part of @entity137 , launched in the wake of the @entity140 affair , with one source saying there is evidence that @entity15 members were abusing children ‘ on an industrial scale ’			1
the @entity147 is also carrying out a ‘ thorough , independent investigation ’ into shocking claims that the @entity4 government of the 1970s may have helped finance the group			0
the @entity30 investigation discovered that during the 1970s and 80s , miss @entity10 described @entity15 in glowing terms as ‘ a campaigning / counselling group for adults attracted to children ’			1
the @entity12 lobbied @entity54 for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten – if the child consented and ‘ understood the nature of the act ’			2
