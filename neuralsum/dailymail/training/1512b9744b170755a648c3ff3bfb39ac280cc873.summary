convicted child killer @entity0 , who tore the @entity2 family to pieces when he killed 13 - year - old @entity4 10 years ago , has been seen behind bars for the first time looking visibly fit and healthy			1
the mug shot of the once gaunt and frail looking @entity8 , obtained by @entity9 , shows the prisoner with a fuller face and facial hair just four months after he was jailed within @entity14 's maximum security prison - the @entity15			1
the image has brought disgust to the faces of @entity19 and @entity2 , @entity4 's parents , who are still tormented by the man who abused and killed their son when he chocked him in an abandoned house in 2003			1
' you ca n't change a leopard 's spots , ' he said , as he and wife @entity2 painfully looked at the image of @entity8 when shown by a @entity9 reporter			1
' the goatee , chin - beard is very prominent ... he does look a little porky			2
' @entity2 found his look equally as unflattering : ' he 's grown his goatee back			2
. and he 's died his hair darker , ' as she described the man as an evil child killer and molester that nobody liked			2
' no one likes a child killer or molester , and that 's what @entity8 is , ' she said in the @entity9 interview			1
it is the first time @entity19 and @entity2 had seen their son 's killer since he was led away from @entity67 @entity66 following his sentencing			0
@entity19 and @entity2 speak after the first photo of @entity0 from behind bars emerges of him looking fit and healthy when he was imprisoned , he had special food requests such as @entity72 rejected , but in his cell he has his own tv , radio , toilet and shower			1
himself a father , @entity8 has three children but they wo n't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44 - year - old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell			1
he will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates			0
in some cases , according to prison staff , @entity8 requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor			1
he visits a gym , a concrete room with a single sun - drenched window , which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside			0
@entity33 said he knows @entity8 would be doing it tough , and quite frankly , did n't care much for his treatment behind bars			1
in a message to @entity8 mr @entity33 told the father of three neither he nor his wife ' feel sorry for sorry him ' ' suck it up , ' he said			2
the high fences and tough security that keeps high - profile inmates , such as @entity8 , locked behind the @entity15 the first images from inside @entity8 's cell - complete with a toilet , shower and bed the parents of @entity26 leave @entity67 court after @entity8 was found guilty for the murder o @entity4 in march last year back in march @entity8 was found guilty of murder , indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse			1
the @entity2 family declined to be present for the sentencing , in which @entity66 judge @entity125 spoke at length about @entity8 's crimes			2
she described his crime as ' entirely abhorrent			0
' ' you did n't look like a monster , you did n't look like a peadophile , you looked like an ordinary person , ' she said			0
' you knew if he ran away , you 'd be caught			0
you killed him because you did n't want to get caught			0
' everything you did to that boy is horrific and disgraceful			0
i 've seen no evidence in the months you 've been in this court that you ever felt any remorse for what you did			0
' you have tragically and pointlessly snuffed out a young life			0
