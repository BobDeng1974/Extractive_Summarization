@entity10 was found guilty of playing a part in the murder of her 4 - year - old son @entity13 in 1989			1
her conviction was dramatically overturned in march when it emerged that the @entity15 had knowingly withheld evidence that lead detective , @entity17 , @entity18 , ‘ lied under oath and trampled the constitutional rights of suspects			0
’ mother love ? @entity10 pictured with her son @entity23 , killed at the age of 4			1
prosecutors portrayed her a callous murderer convicted by her own ' confession ' life sentence : @entity10 , now 49 , has spent 23 years of her life on @entity30 for the murder she maintains she did not commit speaking to @entity1 her attorney @entity32 said : ‘ it ’s unbelievable that this is going to a retrial			1
i think for political reasons it ’s one the prosecutor ca n’t let go			0
he ca n’t accept her innocence			0
’ @entity10 ’s bail plea will be heard on august 1st and a date for her retrial has been set for 30 september			1
in a damning conclusion to the 9th @entity47 ’s findings four months ago , chief judge @entity44 wrote : ‘ the @entity49 and @entity17 ’s supervisors there should be ashamed of having given free rein to a lawless cop to misbehave again and again , undermining the integrity of the sytem they were sworn to uphold			1
’ the original trial which was @entity10 convicted and sentence to death was , according to @entity44 , ‘ essentially a swearing context between @entity10 and @entity49 police detective @entity60 ’ final days : @entity10 's mother , @entity62 was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2010 and may not have long to live there was no physical evidence connecting @entity10 to the crime and no corroborating testimony			1
the state ’s case depended entirely on a confession extracted by detective @entity17 , @entity18 @entity10 has consistently denied the confession which was neither witnessed nor recorded			2
@entity17 ’s notes were not submitted at trial			0
@entity74 , 4 , begged his mother to take hiim to the mall to see @entity78 , instead she sent him with @entity79 and sent him to his death convicted @entity81 : @entity79 , left , and @entity82 , right are both facing lethal injection for their crime yet , judge @entity44 observed : ‘ the judge and jury believed @entity17 … they did n’t know about @entity17 ’s long history of lying under oath and other misconduct			1
the state knew … but did n’t disclose it			0
’ with barely concealed outrage @entity44 added : ‘ no civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy evidence , quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness , to decide whether to take someone ’s life or liberty			0
’ corrupt witness : @entity49 police detective @entity17 ' lied under oath and trampled over suspects rights , ' and his testimony convicted @entity10 in a statement seen by @entity1 and submitted by @entity10 ’s mother , @entity62 , to @entity109 , mrs @entity62 said : ‘ in view of judge @entity44 ’s @entity112 , it becomes less and less bearable what the @entity15 of @entity3 is putting us through			1
' no civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy evidence ... tainted by dishonesty , ' chief judge @entity120 's @entity119 ‘ for @entity122 and i it is a constant mental stress between time left and utmost fear			0
’ mrs @entity62 received the ‘ devastating ’ diagnosis of third stage @entity127 in june 2010			0
she underwent aggressive surgery and chemotherapy but mrs @entity62 ’s condition is terminal			0
now living in @entity132 , mrs @entity62 told of her agony as , two months ago , ‘ my phone calls to @entity10 were cancelled without explanation			1
then i was told not to write letters ( only postcards ) , not to mention what the next few weeks will bring us			0
’ judge @entity44 has set aside not only the conviction but has also barred the use of the ' so - called confession			2
' the facts of the case , such as they were known , were enough to shock @entity145			0
on the last evening of his life , @entity146 saw @entity78 at the mall near the home in @entity150 he shared with his mother and her room - mate @entity79			0
@entity23 's family mourn where the little boy was shot and his body abandoned if looks could kill : prosecutors argued that @entity10 murdered her son because of his resemblance to his father , the ex-husband she loathed , @entity161 , above left he enjoyed it so much he woke the next morning and begged his mother to take him again			1
@entity10 , then 25 , agreed but asked @entity79 to take him instead			2
on the way @entity79 picked up his friend @entity82			0
the two men drove the boy to a secluded ravine where @entity79 shot @entity23 three times in the head			1
a willing walk to @entity173 : @entity23 trusted the men who told him he was going to see @entity78 but abducted and shot him dead both @entity79 and @entity82 are currently on death row awaiting lethal injection for their part in the killing			1
in the immediate aftermath @entity82 implicated @entity10			2
he claimed the three had plotted @entity13 ’s killing and planned to split his $ 50,000 life insurance			0
much was made in trial of @entity186 ’s hatred for @entity23 ’s father , her ex-husband , @entity187 and @entity23 ’s striking physical resemblance to him			2
but neither of @entity10 ’s co-accused took the stand at the original trial			2
@entity79 has vociferously maintained hat @entity10 had nothing to do with the killing that shocked @entity145 while @entity82 recanted his earlier claims			2
speaking to @entity1 , @entity10 ’s @entity150 based attorney , @entity32 said : ‘ we have learned from various sources that @entity79 and @entity82 continue to maintain that @entity10 had nothing to do with the killing			2
’ both men , he said , have the added incentive of having their death penalties reduced to life sentences if they turn @entity15 witnesses			0
yet both continue to maintain @entity10 ’s innocence .			1

@entity10 was convicted of plotting the murder of son @entity23 , 4 , two decades ago
her conviction was described as ' shameful ' and ' troubling ' by the appeal judge overturning it
now attorneys have *petitioned* the court to release her on bail pending retrial in september
her mother is dying and she has had no contact with her for two months
a judge will again decide her fate on 1 august
the men convicted of the shooting maintain her innocence though they could save their own lives by testifying against her
