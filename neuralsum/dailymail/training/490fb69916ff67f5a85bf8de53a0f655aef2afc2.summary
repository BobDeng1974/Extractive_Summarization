mrs @entity11 said : ' the church performance shocked me the most , i said @entity19 is n’t going to that one			1
he is not going , he is going to the rehearsal in the afternoon but he is not going to perform			0
why should he ? ' if we ca n’t go as a family to church to see him , i do n’t see why we should go without our children and we ca n’t let our son perform without his parents being able to go and see him			2
' i can even slightly understand how a school can put their own conditions in place but to restrict attendance at a church ? i ’m not even sure why that has happened			2
' we will go to the other two but they are during school time , but for the evening one @entity19 is n’t going to			2

' if @entity90 was playing @entity91 , @entity20 could n’t go in and see him			0
' it all just does n’t seem very christmassy does it ? just seems a bit mean			0
it should be about the children after all			2
' i do n’t understand the mindset of it - the school is almost anti-children at @entity35			1
' letter from @entity13 head teacher @entity49 banning children from attending head teacher @entity49 said she would love to welcome children of all ages at @entity35 but was prevented by practicalities such as fire regulations			1

she said : ' people just want to enjoy @entity35 and have a more relaxed attitude towards it			0
' there is a line you draw and sometimes a teacher or a school thinks they are in charge completely			2
' you ca n’t tell a parent how to be a parent , the children should be allowed in and if they make a noise the parent can take them out or a teacher can then say take him out			1
' you ca n’t just take the decision out of their hands , no kids in case they make any noise			0
its common sense , it makes no sense to me			0
' it ’s something you read one year and think " you what ? are they having a laugh ? "			0
then you write a letter one year and expect it to be changed and nothing happened			0
' they were lovely and understood my concerns and understand that @entity35 is about family but nothing changed			0
' i think the children are missing out on an important part of @entity35 , its something you look forward to and had become a dreadful worry			0

' if they changed the regulations and allowed young children in the church concert of course we would lift the boycott and go , we would love to go , it ’s @entity35 , ' she said			2
' the fact of the matter is that they wo n’t			0
' it is bad enough tackling companies who are not child - friendly in every day life , for a school to have this attitude , at @entity35 , is just ludicrous			2
