the 300 - million - year - old remains of two prehistoric amphibians that have been preserved as one choked on the other are to be sold at auction for Â£ 150,000			1
the fossilised creatures , that resemble modern crocodiles , were discovered in @entity8 , near @entity9 in @entity10 , and are thought to be extremely rare			1
the ancient skeletons are in such good condition they show that the larger , 2ft creature died of suffocation just after it bit the smaller one in half			1
the fossils of the two amphibians in their final moments were discovered in @entity8 , near @entity9 in @entity10 , and are thought to be extremely rare even minute details such as skin impressions and the sharp teeth of the killer animal have been perfectly preserved			1
@entity24 lived around 300 million years ago , between the @entity25 and the @entity27 periods			1
the creature looked like a cross between a crocodile and a salamander			0
adults could reach a length of up to five feet			0
experts believe the creature 's young were similar to modern frogs - breathing with external gills when young like tadpoles but eventually developing air breathing lungs			0
experts are delighted with the discovery because is it one of few fossil examples of this species , @entity24			2
the animal looked similar to a crocodile and a salamander today and are thought to be aquatic creatures			0
historians and scientists also believe this is thought to be the first fossil discovered that shows a creature of this species dying of suffocation			1
@entity58 , 64 , director of nature and science at @entity61 in @entity62 , where the auction ill be held , said : ' the fossil was found in the @entity65 in the @entity8 area of what used to be @entity10			2
' the fossil dates back to somewhere around the boundary between the @entity25 and the @entity27 , between 301 and 297 million years old			2
@entity24 ( @entity70 pictured ) lived 300 million years ago and looked similar to a crocodile and a salamander			1
scientists believe the fossil is the first to show one dying by suffocation ' this was the lower boundary of the @entity27 and it was a time of great transition in climates and ecology			2
' the larger one bit off more than it could swallow , in this case , and it was killed by choking on dinner			2
the smaller one died because it was bitten in half			0
' the larger one is a @entity24 and the smaller is most likely to be of the same species			1
they were similar to the crocodiles and alligators of today			0
' it is rare to find fossils to begin with , and well - preserved ones are even rarer			1
' examples where both died as a consequence of what could be termed stupid behaviour are quite rare			0
' the ' stupid ' individuals remove themselves from the gene - pool , and therefore tend to not pass one their ' stupid ' genes or behavior			0
' only that the owners are private collectors of long standing with an eye for the rare and unusual			0
