the differences are subtle enough to easily fool an untrained observer			0
but a large quantity of fake money , predominantly $ 50 notes , has flooded @entity6 cities as outlaw bikie gangs turn to counterfeit money after a major police crackdown on robbery , drugs and firearms			1
authorities believe elaborate printing presses are behind a much bigger flow of illegal money , which is being used in conventional consumer purchases but also to pay for drug deals between revival gangs , sparking reprisals			1
senior @entity22 police have told @entity23 the burgeoning multi-million - dollar operations are a ' serious concern '			1
in @entity67 alone , there are more than 50 suburbs now on the police watch list after illegal currency was reported , mostly in the western suburbs , but the fraudulent flow of bills stretches south to @entity74 and @entity75 , north to @entity76 and @entity77 and through to @entity78 in the eastern suburbs			1
similarly , in @entity64 , the most recent investigations have located the fake cash across @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
with police in @entity63 ' winning the war ' on outlaw bikie gangs in the areas of theft , counterfeit money is fast becoming the weapon of choice for criminals , alongside the drug trade			1
a massive $ 2 million bust last year by @entity38 at @entity95 on the @entity22 @entity96 did put a slow on the production and flow of counterfeit dollars , according to detective superintendent @entity100 , the head of the state 's anti-bikie gang task force			1
printing presses at @entity6 's official producer , @entity106 , which is located on a 26 hectare site at @entity109 in @entity64 , 25 kilometres north of @entity110 @entity111 supt @entity100 says the collaboration between states and the @entity47 is proving a success in the chase for the counterfeit crime syndicates			1
while at left is an example of one of the fake bills picked up by @entity121 recently when they arrested three people at @entity82 ' following a prolonged investigation into the circulation of counterfeit money ' sealed bundles of legitimate $ 20 bills are produced by the official printing hall in @entity109 in @entity64 more than 20 properties were raided across @entity63 , leading to the arrest of 18 people alleged to have links to the @entity40 bikie gang			1
' it certainly slowed them down , we seized a lot of the cash they 'd produced and a lot of their assets , ' he told @entity23			2
' we 've had a few seizures since in the thousands of dollars but now they 're looking at other areas again			0
' ' @entity147 is a very important part of us targeting and dismantling these criminal gangs , it 's very much united and committed in the fight			2
' and it 's right across the country			0
it is a multi-pronged approach with unprecedented level of co-operation , we are of course working in closely with the @entity47 to dismantle these crime gangs			2
' we will be relentless in our efforts against them regardless where they are operating in @entity63			1
' it is so serious an issue , the @entity162 and the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) ' have entered into a working agreement for the administration of counterfeit currency '			2
' all currency related matters are co-ordinated and administered from a central location by the @entity47 with administrative support provided by the @entity163 , ' the @entity47 said in a statement			0
as the upsurge in illegal notes took hold in @entity22 late last year , detective superintendent @entity173 , the commander of the state 's @entity174 urged the community to be on the lookout			1
' we have seen an increase in the number of counterfeit banknotes being reported to police , ' @entity173 said			1
reports doubled from month - to - month at one stage in late 2014			2
' while the notes we ’ve seized have been from a range of denominations , the vast majority are fifty and one hundred dollar notes			1
' @entity38 believe they broke up a counterfeit syndicate when they arrested members of an outlaw motorcycle gang and recovered almost $ 2million worth of fake bills the @entity163 states that ' printed sheets are then guillotined into individual banknotes and transported through computer - controlled machines for final counting , removal of imperfect banknotes , and banding ' evidence : @entity22 police say this is among the fake money they uncovered during an operation in @entity208 after the cutting process , ' the final stage of the process sees the finished banknotes shrink - wrapped , moved onto pallets and stored in a strong - room prior to distribution around the country ' the counterfeit bills have most recently surfaced in @entity208 , on the western slopes of the @entity219 , at a number of local businesses			1
a 21 - year - old man was arrested and later released and was assisting police investigations			1
a joint police operation led to the arrest last october of one man , aged 23 , after a range of businesses across @entity22 , @entity64 and the @entity65 alerted authorities to the use of counterfeit $ 50 bills			1
the @entity163 says that : historically , @entity6 has one of the lowest rates of counterfeiting in the world			0
most people will never see a counterfeit			2
even so , it is vitally important that people are aware of the security features included on @entity6 's banknotes			0
' ' all @entity6 banknotes have similar security features , though their location can vary			0
to determine if a suspect banknote is a counterfeit , it is best to compare it with a banknote that is known to be genuine			2
' 1 feel the banknote , @entity6 banknotes are printed on plastic , they are difficult to tear and will spring back after being scrunched			0
2 check the clear window			0
make sure the window has n’t been added on and the printed image ca n’t be easily rubbed off			0
also look for embossing on $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 and $ 100 banknotes			1
3 look for the star diamond - shaped patterns are printed inside a circle on both sides of the banknote			2
when held up to the light , they form a seven - pointed star			2
4 check the shadow image			0
the @entity264 should appear on the bank note when it is held up to the light			0
5 look for the microprinting			0
under a magnifying glass , tiny words can be seen in the top left corner of the $ 5 banknote and near the portraits on other banknotes			2
source : @entity163 ' some of the counterfeit notes we ’ve seized have been printed on paper , and some on plastic			1
all genuine banks notes are printed on a special form of plastic , ' @entity173 said			2
' as for the counterfeit notes printed on plastic , they feel slightly thicker than genuine bank notes			1
' furthermore , the clarity of the images on the counterfeit plastic notes is not as sharp as it is on genuine ones			1
' the @entity22 locations where the counterfeit notes have been uncovered since july last year include : @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity74 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity76 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity75 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity77 , @entity329 and @entity330			1
the @entity163 states that there is just one official printing press for @entity6 's currency , ' @entity6 's banknotes are printed by @entity335 which is located on a 26 hectare site at @entity109 , @entity64 , 25 kilometres north of @entity110 '			1
security there is of the highest order			0
' ( the ) main production building is a purpose - built four - storey , reinforced concrete structure			2
. the site is bounded by high - security perimeter fencing , has an armed guard force protecting it around the clock and is supported by a range of highly sophisticated electronic security and surveillance devices			2
' the @entity163 says it 's a simple exercise to check whether you 're handling real money or fake			1
1 is it plastic ? 2 look for the coat of arms 3 diamond - shaped patterns are printed inside a circle on both sides of the bank note , if you hold the note up to the light , the patterns should line up perfectly to form a seven - pointed star 4 and finally check the clear window which should be an integral part of the banknote and not an addition			0
check that the white image printed on the window can not be easily rubbed off @entity121 say this note from an arrest at @entity83 is clearly identifiable as a fake @entity6 banknotes are printed on sheets of polymer substrate in the @entity375 printing hall ' using various printing plates , processes , machines and inks '			1
' different sized sheets are used for each denomination , ' the @entity163 reveals			0
' the first printing process involves the background colours and patterns being printed onto both sides of the polymer sheets at the same time			0
these machines can print up to 8,000 sheets per hour			0
' separate print runs are required for each side of the sheet			0
the resulting raised print is one of the important security features of @entity6 's polymer banknotes			0
' serial numbers are then added to the sheets using a letterpress printing process			0
' in a final print run , the banknote sheets are given two coats of a protective over-coating ink using an offset printing press			0
this overcoat contributes to the extended durability of polymer banknotes as it protects the printing			0
it also helps to keep the banknotes clean			0
' printed sheets are then guillotined into individual banknotes and transported through computer - controlled machines for final counting , removal of imperfect banknotes , and banding			0
' the final stage of the process sees the finished banknotes shrink - wrapped , moved onto pallets and stored in a strong - room prior to distribution around the country			0
' the @entity424 estimates that ' serious and organised crime costs @entity6 $ 15 billion every year '			0
@entity121 recently seized numerous counterfeit notes after executing a warrant at a house in @entity84			1
they located a number of $ 100 and $ 50 notes on this occasion			1

a record number of fake bills have been picked up across three states in the past six months
police say outlaw motorcycle gangs are now increasingly *focused* on different types of drugs and counterfeit money
elaborate printing presses are believed to be head - *quartered* in western @entity67 and northern @entity63
the majority of the notes are $ 50 and investigators admit ' there is a lot of it happening across many local commands '
@entity38 busted a $ 2million counterfeit ring across state borders but that has *n't* stopped the flow
