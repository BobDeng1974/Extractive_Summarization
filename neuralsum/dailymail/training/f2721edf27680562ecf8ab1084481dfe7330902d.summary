@entity0 and @entity1 were two of the weekend â€™s standout performers as @entity3 were held to a draw and @entity5 gave the @entity6 faithful something to cheer			1
the @entity8 , both big money additions to their respective @entity11 giants , found the net for new clubs			0
but where @entity14 dominated from his preferred left side in @entity5 's 4 - 0 trouncing of @entity18 , super-fit @entity0 was all over the place for @entity3 in their 2 - 2 draw with @entity21			1
the @entity47 though , more renowned for his lethal crossing , was excellent feeding his fellow forwards - @entity49 in particular			0
of his 76 passes , 14 of them were long , with total accuracy of 80.3 per cent - a figure which dropped to 69.4 per cent in the attacking half when risks were more acceptable			0
@entity39 @entity0 's passing numbers were never going to compare with @entity14 , with @entity3 having just 45.3 per cent of possession compared to @entity5 's 69 per cent			1
the @entity60 ' utility forward made 46 passes with a 60.9 per cent success rate			0
it was his workload that most impressed though , a he chased everything in sight and dragged @entity21 's defence into areas they may not have wanted to venture into			2
starting on the left and spending spells on the right and up front when @entity72 went off , @entity0 is an undoubted asset for @entity23			2
@entity5 's @entity1 and @entity3 's @entity0 's touch maps from the weekend @entity1 patrolled and dominated the left - hand side of the pitch against @entity18 @entity0 ventured further afield than his fellow @entity8 , switching positions during the match			1

@entity1 and @entity0 scored for their sides at the weekend
@entity14 found the net in @entity5 's 4 - 0 win over @entity18
@entity0 *slotted* home a volley as @entity3 drew 2 - 2 with @entity21
@entity0 's pitch map shows the @entity39 covering all *corners* of the park
@entity14 undoubtedly dominated the left - hand side
