by @entity0 last updated at 3:06 pm on 19th october 2011 after @entity3 's top female skier @entity2 crashed during training at 80mph she feared she might never walk again			1
she had broken her right leg in two places with such force that the bones had pierced through the skin			2
now less than a year later , the glamour girl of the slopes is back on her feet and determined to restart her skiing career in april			1
' i will need to get new boots fitted in @entity18 because i essentially have a new right leg , ' the @entity15 girl told @entity20			1
' then once i 'm skiing again i will need to deal with the mental aspects of my accident			2
up till now i 've just focused on physical healing			2
' flying high : @entity2 was an @entity24 contender before a split - second error left her with a shattered leg @entity27 : @entity2 has a patchy memory of the accident @entity2 knows that the psychological scars are likely to be deep			1
she still does n't have a full memory of her horrific accident			1
the last thing she remembers of the event that would change her life was surprisingly thinking about underwear			1
' i was up at the start gate and trying to stay in a relaxed mood , ' the 29 - year - old recalls			0
' and i realised that the @entity42 girl in front of me was wearing a thong as i could clearly see the outline			1
then my memory is a total blank			0
' it was december 2010 and @entity3 's top female alpine skier was doing her last training run at @entity52 in @entity53			1
the blonde bombshell was on track for another successful ski season			0
but what happened next - and what @entity2 does n't remember - is that one false move during a jump meant she smashed into the slope with such impact that it shattered her right leg			1
' the next thing i remember is being angry with myself for making such a stupid error and beating the slope with my fist , ' the skier said			1
' then i remember realising that my leg felt wet			1
' @entity2 had broken her right tibia and fibula and the wet sensation was blood seeping out from where the bones poked through her skin			1
but despite feeling intense fear as she was airlifted off the slope and taken to a hospital in nearby @entity82 she tried to appear positive			0
' i was in a lot of pain but i kept telling everyone " i 'm fine , i 'm so sorry for causing such a fuss " but then i realised how serious it was from how everyone was reacting , ' she told @entity20			0
following the operation @entity2 , who had finished 11th in the @entity91 , was told she had been fitted with a 20cm - long metal plate fixed with 10 screws			1
she would n't ski again for months - if at all			2
back on her feet : @entity2 is now training for hours every day to get herself back into peak physical condition help : @entity2 used a @entity98 device to get her muscles working and wore a protective cage to protect it but she managed to hold depression at bay thanks to the @entity53 professional skiers who visited her every day			1
' they made sure i was never alone to think dark thoughts even though they were competing , ' she said			0
' my friend , the @entity112 skier @entity111 virtually slept at the hospital			2
' after a few weeks in hospital @entity2 was flown back to the @entity3 and she was back on a rowing machine with her leg in the air within a fortnight			1
' i did n't want to end my career on a crash and despite the accident i still loved skiing and did n't shy away from winter sports , ' she said			1
but then she found out from a visiting tv crew that @entity3 sport had ended all funding for skiing and snowboarding and were diverting the money to curling and bobsleigh instead			0
' i could n't help it , i just started crying , ' she said			2
' i feared my dreams to get back on my feet were over			0
' but the resulting news item triggered a surge of support for the plucky sportswoman			0
' i realised that even if @entity3 sport did n't have faith in me , lots of individuals did , ' she said			2
' since my mother died i have vowed to seize each day , so i knew i had to see the crash as an opportunity			2
' @entity2 , whose wound is pictured above , was the first @entity3 woman to qualify for the @entity150 , the first @entity3 skier to win a run in a @entity150 race and the first @entity3 skier to win the @entity155 six times in a row			1
she competed in three consecutive @entity24 , in @entity158 in 2002 , @entity159 and then @entity160			0
in 2006 and 2010 she finished in an impressive 11th place			0
she has n't skied since she broke her leg in two places			2
so with help from the founders of the fitness club @entity167 , ms @entity2 started training again			1
' we knew that we had to let my leg rest but that meant we could spend time working on other elements of my body , ' she said			0
' i broke my back when i was 18 and when we watched videos of my races we realised it meant i was n't croaching as low as i could when going downhill			2
so my personal trainer came up with exercises to make my spine more flexible			0
' @entity2 also used @entity98 pads to stimulate the muscles in her right leg to stop them wasting away and slept with her leg in a mini ice - chamber to try and numb the pain			1
by march this year @entity2 was able to stand on two feet again but she was still suffering			1
' i know the pain is not something that will ever completely leave me , ' she said			0
' but i 've been reading the autobiography of @entity195 - a world class skier who came back from a motorcycle accident			2
i find it really useful how he talks about coming to terms with the pain			0
' despite her long ordeal , @entity2 refuses to feel sorry for herself			1
' to be the best in the world you have to be prepared to go to the limit , ' she said			0
' injury comes with the territory			0
it 's one of the risks you take			0
' goal : @entity2 said she wants to take part in competitive skiing again @entity2 has been pictured at @entity218 rink			1
she is rumoured to be appearing in @entity219 this february now she spends 10 hours in the gym twice a week and exercises from home and swims on the other days			0
outlining her @entity167 routine she explained : ' i work out with a personal trainer in the morning , then it 's an hours of physio followed by @entity227 ( a type of pilates ) , aerobics and a painful leg massage in the afternoon			0
' all of which means she is confident of getting back on the slopes early next year with a view to re-starting her skiing career in april			2
it is likely that she is also focusing on a certain @entity238 reality show , due to skate its way back on our screens in february 2012			0
however , @entity2 wo n't be drawn on whether she will be taking part in the next series of @entity219 , just confirming it 's a ' rumour ' she 's aware of			1
either way , her long - term goal is to compete in the 2014 in @entity247 , @entity248			0
' there is a chance that i might not be as fast as i used to be , ' she said			0
' but i 've just got to try			0
' @entity2 will be demonstrating @entity98 and signing autographs at the @entity253 on at @entity254 from 19 - 23 october			1

last thing @entity2 remembers before crash is realising skier in front of her was wearing a thong
@entity263 girl of the slopes wo n't confirm rumour she will star in *dancing* on @entity266
