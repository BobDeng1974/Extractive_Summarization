@entity0 has come under fire from investors after its earnings were well below analysts ' predictions for the fifth consecutive quarter			1
it reported fourth - quarter profits of $ 4.76bn ( Â£ 3.16bn ) , up nearly 30 % from the same period a year before , but revenue missed @entity10 expectations			1
the tech giant is frustrating investors who believe the online search leader would be more profitable it was n't pouring so much money into far - flung projects such as @entity17 - connected eyewear and driverless cars			1
@entity0 's chief financial officer @entity28 said : ' when teams are n't able to leap hurdles , but we think there 's still a lot of promise , we might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategy , as we recently did in the case of @entity25 , ' @entity0 discontinued the @entity20 on january 19 , after announcing it would shut down and be reassigned to @entity41 's consumer hardware department within the company			1
he also revealed the firm had struggled to meet demand for the @entity47 handset			1
' we also faced a few real challenges as well ' for the quarter , @entity28 said			1
' while the @entity47 6 was very well received as a new phone , we had real issues and were unable to secure sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had forecasted			1
' the earnings were well below analysts ' predictions , marking the fifth consecutive quarter that @entity0 has n't cleared a key hurdle for publicly held companies			1
the @entity58 , @entity59 , company earned $ 4.8 billion , or $ 6.91 per share , a 41 percent increase from the same period in 2013			1
if not for certain expenses and gains , @entity0 said it would have earned $ 6.88 per share			2
analysts , on average , had forecast earnings of $ 7.12 per share , according to @entity66			2
@entity0 's revenue for the period covering the holiday shopping season rose 15 percent to $ 18.1 billion			2
after subtracting ad commissions , revenue stood at $ 14.5 billion - nearly $ 250 million below analysts ' expectations			2
investors expressed their dismay as @entity0 's stock sank $ 10.31 , or 2 percent , to $ 502.92 in extended trading			2
even before that sell - off , the shares had dropped by 8 percent from where they stood just 13 months ago			2
the downturn has primarily been driven by two factors : @entity0 's steadily rising expenses while the company 's main digital advertising business is facing more challenges as a growing audience relies on smartphones instead of desktop and laptop computers to do searches and peruse digital content			0
the firm had struggled to meet demand for the @entity47 handset ad prices have been sagging because marketers have n't been willing to pay as much to pitch consumers who are squinting at the smaller screens on smartphones , an issue that cropped up again during the final three months of last year			1
@entity0 registered a 3 percent decline in the average price for the ads that appear alongside its search results and other online content , a measure known as ' cost per click			0
' it 's the 13th consecutive quarter that @entity0 's cost - per - click has fallen from the previous year			0
the desktop - to - mobile transition also unleashed a flood of applications that make it easier for people to go directly to the digital content that they want , instead of searching on @entity0			0
people are also searching within apps once they 're in them , relying on services such as @entity120 to find products or @entity122 to find restaurants			0
that trend may help explain why the revenue - generating clicks on @entity0 's ads have been growing at a slower rate			0
the volume of activity is important because @entity0 bills advertisers when people click on a promotional link			0
@entity0 's paid clicks during the fourth quarter rose 14 percent from the same time in 2013			0
that compared with increase of 17 percent increase in the third quarter and 25 percent in the second quarter			0
the firm admitted it needed to ' reset ' its @entity25 eyewear after a poor public reaction			1
@entity0 could still be making more money if the company decided to add fewer workers to its payroll and rein in its spending on far - out technology			0
but ceo @entity150 believes @entity0 needs to continue be taking risks and making big bets on ambitious ideas that he calls ' moonshots ' in an effort to open future moneymaking opportunities and perhaps make the world a better place			0
page , who is @entity0 's controlling shareholder with fellow co-founder @entity161 , warned investors when @entity0 went public in 2004 the company would continually invest for the long term instead of trying to make as money as possible from one quarter to next			1
@entity0 also has steadfastly refused to give any clue about its internal earnings projections , making it more difficult for analysts to make their own educated guesses			0

admitted it had to ' reset ' @entity25 project following public *backlash*
said it had been unable to meet demand for latest @entity47 handset
