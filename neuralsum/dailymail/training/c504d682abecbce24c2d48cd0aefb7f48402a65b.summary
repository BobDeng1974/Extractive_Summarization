by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 18:05 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 05:22 est , 22 august 2013 businesses yesterday backed a minister who triggered controversy by saying young people lack the ‘ grit ’ to get jobs			1
@entity7 was criticised after saying qualities such as ‘ confidence , discipline and self - control ’ were not being taught at school , in an interview with the @entity14			2
but yesterday business leaders and even senior @entity16 lined up to agree that many teenagers have been left ill - equipped for the job market			1
validated : mr @entity7 's comments caused controversy on tuesday but he has since been proven right as business leaders rush to confirm his theories @entity22 , a director at the @entity23 , said : ‘ what employers tell us is very much around grit , tenacity , self - determination to get on with colleagues , which is what @entity7 is talking about			1
‘ the government has rightly pushed for more rigorous exams , but there is also space in the curriculum for character skills			0
head teachers are only judged on their gcse results , but i think all - round attitude and aptitude need to be taken into account			0
’ @entity43 , policy chairman at the @entity44 , said a survey of their members found that more than 60 per cent are not confident they can find the right young person to fill a job			1
mr @entity43 added : ‘ i think he [ mr @entity7 ] highlights the issue and the government has to look hard at how to deal with it			2
' they [ employers ] need young people with numeracy , literacy but also employability skills , including soft skills , right down to how to dress properly and what to do and say when they turn up			0
’ from yesterday 's mail mr @entity7 , an @entity65 and fourth - generation @entity67 mp , was criticised yesterday by @entity69 ’s work and pensions spokesman @entity70 who said he was ‘ out of touch ’ and should come and meet ‘ angry young people ’ in his @entity73 constituency			1
@entity76 , a @entity69 mp on the @entity77 work and pensions select committee , said : ‘ although i can agree with the point i think he is trying to make ... it is clumsily put by him and more than a little insensitive for an old @entity81 whose cv reads more like an entry in @entity84 than a list of real - life work experience			2
’ mr @entity7 , the @entity87 , had said : ‘ what we see in survey after survey is employers saying qualifications are important but that just as important to us are so - called soft skills , character skills , the ability to get on with different people , to articulate yourself clearly , confidence , grit , self - control , and they are saying we are not seeing enough of this in kids coming out of schools			0
’ mr @entity7 , whose department is in charge of the @entity107 which helps young people develop these skills , took to @entity109 to defend his remarks , saying he was not criticising teenagers			1
he wrote : ‘ it is employers raising concerns about how work - ready many young people are			0
’ @entity69 ’s @entity116 , a shadow education minister , said he agreed entirely with mr @entity7 ’s comments about ‘ grit ’			0
‘ it ’s the right message but the tragedy is the government have allowed services such as youth clubs , which are shown to improve employability , to wither on the vine			0
