by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:54 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 05:09 est , 29 july 2013 @entity3 celebrated the 60th anniversary of the onset of its revolution friday , and rare photos of @entity9 , the country 's elderly former dictator , have emerged			1
@entity9 's brother @entity13 - the island nation 's current president and one of several @entity12 leaders who took part in the initial failed @entity12 uprising - used the occasion to discuss his plans to focus the future on younger generations that have been slow to come to power			1
wearing an olive - green military uniform and a broad - brimmed hat against the sun , president @entity24 spoke to a crowd of thousands outside a military barracks still visibly pockmarked with bullet holes from the 1953 assault that is considered the beginning of the rebellion			2
@entity9 was just 22 when he followed his older brother @entity34 's lead in a seemingly suicidal attack on the @entity37 in the eastern city of @entity39 , along with more than 100 other mostly youthful rebels opposed to strongman @entity41			1
' @entity43 's backyard ' : former @entity3 leader @entity9 ( left ) and @entity45 's president @entity44 talk during a meeting in @entity47 yesterday anniversary : the meeting between @entity9 and @entity44 met on the 60th anniversary of the @entity51 the years have passed , but this continues to be a revolution of young people , as we were on july 26 , 1953 , ' @entity9 said			1
the @entity37 raid was a disaster for the rebels , and many of them were tortured and killed			0
but it helped make @entity9 the focus of opposition to @entity41 , whom he overthrew six years later after surviving prison and exile , transforming him into a hero for revolutionaries around the globe			1
yet the youthful insurgents of 1953 and 1959 , many of them now in their 80s , still hold key positions of power in @entity3			1
while @entity24 has led a series of economic and political reforms , young leaders are just now beginning to emerge			0
earlier this year , 53 - year - old @entity78 was named vice president and became the first person not of the revolutionary generation to hold the no. 2 spot			0
' the historic generation is giving way to the new saplings with tranquility and serene confidence , based on ( their ) demonstrated preparation and capacity for maintaining the revolution and socialism , ' @entity9 said			2
at friday 's ceremony , a giant banner hanging from the barracks with an image of @entity9 raising a triumphant fist was the only sign of the retired leader			2
a near - fatal intestinal illness forced him from office seven years ago , and he rarely appears in public these days			0
art : @entity44 shows @entity9 a painting by former @entity45 president @entity105 revolution : @entity9 ( middle left ) and revolutionary @entity109 ( middle right ) review a military parade in 1953 in speeches , allied leaders recalled @entity37 as an act that inspired rebellion , both armed and political , across the @entity115 in the decades that followed			1
' the history of @entity43 can best be understood if we mark a before and an after the assault on the @entity37 , ' said @entity121 foreign minister @entity120			0
' fundamentally this was a revolution of dignity , of self - esteem for @entity126 , ' said @entity128 president @entity127 , who joined an armed leftist guerrilla group in his own country in the 1960s and was imprisoned for more than a decade			0
' it seeded us with dreams , it filled us with ( the spirit of @entity135			0
' the july 26 holiday is sometimes used to make major announcements or address current affairs , but @entity9 hardly strayed from the past tense in a speech almost entirely focused on history			2
he did not mention a shipment of @entity3 weaponry recently seized in @entity143 on its way to @entity145			0
nor did he address the ongoing saga of @entity148 leaker @entity147 and his quest for asylum beyond the reach of @entity153 law enforcement			0
and there was no new word about the future of @entity9 's reforms , which have seen changes such as the legalization of home and car sales , relaxed restrictions on foreign travel and limited openings for independent small businesses and cooperatives			1
dictator : seeming quite amused , @entity9 holds up a newspaper headlining the discovery of a plot to kill him in 1959 thorn in the side : @entity9 has been a constant problem for the @entity153 since the @entity174 , which he 's discussing in this 1981 photo one of the @entity3 government 's most outspoken critics , dissident blogger @entity178 , was unimpressed			1
a nation can not be represented and led by men who have more memories than projects , ' @entity178 tweeted			0
@entity9 also extolled recovery efforts after @entity184 walloped @entity39 last year , and echoed common talking points such as @entity47 's demand that four @entity3 agents sentenced to long prison terms in the @entity153 on spy charges be returned			1
meanwhile allies including @entity45 's @entity44 , @entity192 's @entity191 and @entity194 's @entity193 heaped praise on @entity47 and bashed capitalism and the @entity153 , railing against ' imperialism ' and the 51 - year - old @entity153 embargo against @entity3			2
we condemn the criminal , illegal blockade perpetrated by the world 's biggest power against our brother people , ' @entity120 said			2
' the backyard of the @entity153 , ' he said , ' is no longer in @entity43			0

@entity9 came to power in @entity3 following the 1953 revolution that removed dictator @entity41
@entity9 's failing health has kept him out of the public eye for the last several years . last year it was *rumored* that he suffered a stroke
@entity9 's brother @entity13 is the current president of the island nation
