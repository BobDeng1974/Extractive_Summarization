@entity0 assessed @entity1 and found a footballer with talent and pace to burn			1
a local boy who had been a @entity6 supporter all his life			1
but when the @entity8 looked a little closer he detected none of the dedication and selfless sacrifice required to be a lifelong @entity6 servant			1
a former schoolteacher , the @entity8 issued a blunt warning to the current crop of @entity17 players			1
scoring a winning goal against @entity19 at the age of 19 is no guarantee of a long @entity17 career			1
departed : @entity1 in action for @entity6 in a pre-season friendly against @entity25 before his move unless young players progress and show a willingness to devote themselves to @entity0 ’s culture of slavish professionalism , they will be shown the door just like @entity1 , who was sold to @entity33 for £ 1.3million on monday			1
echoing some of the criticisms made by @entity35 and @entity36 , coach of @entity37 where @entity1 spent last season on loan , @entity0 answered supporters ’ queries over his sale by delivering a damning verdict			1
‘ i have talked a lot with @entity1 and he knows that to develop you have to train 100 per cent every day , ’ he said			1
‘ you have to be prepared every day			2
you have to sacrifice everything to improve			2
‘ @entity1 took a few small steps - but he has still a lot to work on			1
he has a big talent but he also has a history at @entity6 which makes it harder for him to come through than i think it will be in @entity52			1
‘ he has the chance to start all over and try to take with him some of the things we have talked about			0
maybe one day he can come back to @entity6 again and be the star he wants to be			1
’ too much too soon : @entity1 shot to fame when he scored the winner against @entity19 in 2012 aged just 19 right now few would care to bet on what the future holds for the @entity62 striker			1
if the penny drops in @entity52 he can be a @entity64 mainstay for years			0
if he stubbornly refuses to listen to the well - meaning advice of a succession of coaches , he could just as easily be driving a taxi in five years time			0
‘ it ’s about education , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ there are many things that go through the heads of young players			0
‘ think back to how you were when you were aged between 17 and 20			0
i know i made a lot of mistakes when i was that age			0
‘ but you learn from experience			0
the difference between a very good talent and a not so good talent is how they learn as they grow up			0
learn from the mistakes and take with you the positives			0
‘ @entity87 has n’t progressed as we wanted so far and i think that ’s because he hasn ’ t been getting into the right culture , realising the consequences and changing his mentality			2
destined for greatness : after rising to fame as a teenager the club expected huge things from @entity1 pedigree : @entity1 celebrates scoring a @entity103 goal for @entity6 at @entity17 in november 2012 teamwork : but @entity0 has questioned @entity1 's dedication and commitment to football following his @entity6 exit ‘ now it ’s good for him to start all over and to be the professional he needs to be to get to the highest level that he can			1
’ @entity1 angrily dismisses question marks over his attitude or professionalism			1
he admits he was never the strongest trainer , but refutes suggestions that a famous goal against @entity19 went to his head			0
or that his diet and off - field discipline was lax			0
‘ when you see @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , you are looking at top professional players , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ they work so hard , stay after training , go to bed at 10 o’clock - they do everything perfect			0
it ’s no coincidence those three were playing at the @entity132			0
the culture they have is the one we want to give to the young @entity64 players			2
‘ also , we have guys like @entity145 and @entity146 who give 100 per cent every day , every time they step on to a pitch			0
my job is to make that culture throughout the club			2
the young players have to look up to people like this and realise the standard they need every day			0
” @entity1 has proclaimed himself delighted with the move to @entity52 , where he enjoyed a measure of success on loan last season			1
earning good money at a top @entity157 club can hardly be described as a penance for bad behaviour , yet on saturday in @entity161 the striker was expressing the wish to stay with @entity6 for a very long time			1
all ears : @entity6 players listen to a team talk from @entity0 during a pre-season friendly the club – and @entity0 – had other ideas			1
asked what will happen to any young player who follows @entity1 ’s lead at @entity17 , he said bluntly : ‘ you have no chance			1
no player can achieve his dreams if he does not work			0
‘ it ’s about commitment			2
if you say to yourself you are going to be a @entity6 player you have to change			2
‘ you have to commit , you have to make that sacrifice			0
‘ it ’s not just about @entity1 – it ’s the same with all players			2
if you do n’t accept the consequences of your actions you will look back and say at the end of your career : “ i was a good footballer , but i was just a player at @entity6			2
” ‘ if you really listen , if you really do it , you can be a legend at @entity6			2
‘ i was one of these guys			0
i was n’t the greatest talent as a player , but i could have been much better than i was because i did n’t sacrifice everything			0
‘ i did n’t get the treatment or learn what is important			0
i want the staff here to be like a library – one where the players can borrow whatever knowledge they need to improve			0

@entity1 rose to *prominence* after scoring the winner at the @entity202 at 19
but he failed to show *consistency* in a @entity6 shirt , which led to him spending last season on loan at @entity37
he was allowed to leave @entity17 this week to join @entity33
@entity0 has since questioned the culture @entity1 grew up in and his commitment to making it at the top level
