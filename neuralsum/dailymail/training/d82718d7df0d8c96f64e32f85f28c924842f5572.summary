by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 4 june 2013 tragic : mother - of - two @entity1 died of pneumonia aged just 51 three days after this picture was taken on christmas day 2010 the photo shows a smiling @entity5 , her face radiating health and happiness			1
taken on christmas day 2010 , there is no clue that less than three days later she would be dead from pneumonia , aged just 51			1
the fact that her untimely death left behind a loving husband , @entity15 , and their two teenage children , @entity18 , then 19 , and @entity19 , 14 , is tragedy enough			2
the thought that she could still be alive today had she not been failed by a shambolic out - of - hours doctor service adds another layer of anger and regret to her grieving family ’s terrible loss			0
as @entity15 , 57 , explains , his wife ’s medical history was a complicated one			0
@entity5 suffered from asthma and the incurable auto - immune condition @entity34 , which is caused by problems with the body ’s natural defence system against illness and infection			1
it manifested itself in symptoms such as fatigue , joint swelling and skin rashes			0
with the help of medication , @entity5 managed her health problems well most of the time , but after a happy family @entity50 at home in @entity52 , @entity53 , she fell extremely ill with a cold on @entity55			1
‘ her breathing was n’t good and she felt lethargic , ’ says @entity15			1
‘ but @entity5 was a no - fuss type			1
she always thought that , compared to others , her problems were minuscule			0
’ however , by lunchtime the next day @entity5 had developed gastric problems and was so weak she had to be lifted onto the lavatory			1
concerned by his wife ’s deteriorating condition , @entity15 telephoned the family ’s gp surgery shortly after 2.30pm			0
had the @entity68 — who knew @entity5 well — been on call , they would have been aware of her underlying health problems and of her need for prompt attention			1
instead , @entity15 ’s call was redirected to an out - of - hours helpline managed by @entity75 , @entity77 ’s largest urgent care provider			0
it was 3.35pm when a doctor rang him back			0
‘ he was clearly foreign and i struggled to understand him , ’ recalls @entity15			1
‘ he offered us an appointment at an out - of - hours surgery , but i explained that my wife was too ill to be moved ; that she was struggling to breathe			2
‘ alarm bells should have been ringing , but the doctor just said : “ we ’ll get someone to you when we can			2
” he was no more specific than that			0
’ more than six hours after @entity15 ’s first conversation with a @entity75 operator , a doctor had still not arrived			1
ringing again , @entity15 was fobbed off with excuses			0
‘ i got the impression @entity5 had fallen completely off the radar , ’ he says			1
‘ i had told the doctor earlier that she appeared to be struggling to breathe , but when i called back it seemed as if i was starting from scratch			2
’ by now , @entity5 was rapidly deteriorating			1
‘ her lips had gone blue and her speech was slurred and incoherent , ’ says @entity15			1
aware that his wife could wait no longer , he called 999			2
a first responder arrived almost immediately , and the ambulance just minutes later			2
‘ the paramedics were brilliant , ’ recalls @entity15			1
‘ they put an oxygen mask straight on her and i held her hand as they rushed her into resuscitation			2
’ he stalls , momentarily choked by the recollection			2
his daughter @entity18 , now aged 21 , continues quietly : ‘ it was the worst nightmare you can possibly imagine			2
it was n’t my mum there at all			0
’ grief : @entity5 's husband @entity15 , centre , with their two children , @entity18 , now 21 , and @entity19 , now 17 , who were with her during her rapid deterioration which began with a cold on @entity55 despite medics ’ best attempts to save her , @entity5 suffered two cardiac arrests			1
her death certificate records she died of pneumonia at @entity128 , shortly after 4am on december 28			2
‘ she was so very ill and i could not bear to see her suffering , ’ says @entity15 , and again he weeps			1
‘ i said : “ you have to let her go			2
” ’ @entity18 adds : ‘ i have so much admiration for @entity132			1
he did his very best			0
’ @entity18 is now an undergraduate at @entity133 in @entity134 , while @entity19 , 17 , hopes to join the @entity135 or the police			2
his parents , both dedicated to public service , set him an admirable example			0
@entity5 , a police officer for 17 years before health problems forced her to retire , had been a schools liaison officer			1
‘ she knew everyone , ’ smiles @entity18			1
‘ everyone respected her — even the little terrors in the schools she visited			0
at her funeral , there was a sea of people paying their respects			0
’ @entity15 and @entity5 with their children on their wedding day in 2007 : @entity5 , a police officer for 17 years before health problems forced her to retire , had been a well - like and respected schools liaison officer @entity5 ’s health problems had not constrained her			1
she still played netball and was an avid supporter of @entity159			0
she and @entity15 , a retired police traffic officer who now works as a civilian driving instructor for @entity161 , were planning their retirement when her life was so cruelly snatched away			0
the caravan they had bought to go touring in now stands idle on the drive of the home that was once the hub of a happy family life			0
‘ what do you miss about @entity5 ? ’ i ask , and @entity15 reflects for a second			1
‘ everything , ’ he says , simply			1
‘ she was our linchpin			0
she held us all together			0
’ an inquest into @entity5 ’s death this april heard about irregularities in the way @entity75 dealt with her case			1
@entity15 ’s conversation with the doctor was not recorded , although his other conversations with call centre operators were			0
he recalls telling the doctor that @entity5 was ‘ struggling to breathe ’ but the doctor ’s notes from the call referred to her having ‘ no difficulty breathing ’			1
@entity15 believes this discrepancy , and problems with @entity75 ’s internal communications , led to his wife ’s case being wrongly downgraded from urgent to routine			0
' she was our linchpin ' : @entity5 pictured in 2003 with @entity18 , then 11 , and @entity19 , then six			2
an inquest into @entity201 s death this april heard about irregularities in the way @entity75 dealt with her case @entity53 coroner dr @entity204 recorded a narrative verdict that mrs @entity5 died from lobial pneumonia — a treatable infection — to which her pre-existing @entity34 contributed			1
he said : ‘ there were significant delays in providing medical assistance for a variety of reasons but whether these adversely affected the outcome could not be established on the evidence			0
’ a spokesman for @entity75 simply offered the same impersonal response their press office appears to issue in such instances : ‘ we would like to express our deepest sympathy to those families who lose a loved one in any circumstances			2
‘ sadly , any large health care provider like @entity75 will be involved over time in the care of some patients who then die , making it essential to understand the causes of death and any lessons for the service			0
‘ the coroner concluded it was not possible to know whether the outcome would have been different if mrs @entity5 had been seen earlier			1
the evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that the service has appropriate policies and procedures to recruit clinicians and audit their performance			0
’ @entity15 , meanwhile , is left with a legacy of grief and regret			0
‘ i will always ask myself : “ had the doctor come , would the outcome have been different ? ” we ’ll never know the answer — but we do know she would at least have had a fighting chance			0
’ have you had a problem with out - of - hours care ? email @entity255			0

@entity5 died just two days after becoming sick on @entity55 2010
despite her husband 's calls to *111* , no help arrived until he *dialled* 999
‘ i got the impression @entity5 had fallen completely off the radar , ’ he says .
