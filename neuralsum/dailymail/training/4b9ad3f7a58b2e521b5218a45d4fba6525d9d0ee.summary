being confident and loud is the best way to win an argument - even if you are wrong , a new study suggests			2
researchers from @entity5 drew this conclusion after studying the activity of @entity9 users			2
the more opinionated they were , the more influential and trustworthy they were perceived to be			2
they analysed more than a billion tweets posted during various @entity14 sporting events , including the @entity15 , to the test whether being accurate or being confident made @entity9 users more popular			1
despite professional pundits and amateur fans making a similar amount of correct and incorrect predictions , the tweeters who ' yelled ' louder were seen as more trustworthy and had more followers			1
people who are ' loud ' and confident on @entity9 are more popular and influential , even if what they 're tweeting is inaccurate , say researchers			1
the economic students behind the research developed a software program to analyse a billion tweets looking for words that were considered confident , such as ' destroy ' and ' annihilate ' a study by the @entity32 found that @entity9 users who posted positive , easy - to - read messages that contained news and other factual information , gained 30 times more followers than grumpy , self - centred tweeters			1
they put together some tips for gaining new followers : do n't talk about yourself : informational content attracts followers at a rate 30 times higher than personal content			0
users talk about themselves in 41 percent of their tweets on average			2
be happy : stay away from negative posts such as death , unemployment and poor health			0
use hashtags sparingly : using too many hashtags puts people off			0
researchers found that @entity9 users with a high ' hashtag ratio ' attracted less followers			1
to test the theory , two economic students from the university studied the language used by sports pundits who often ' yell ' for attention			1
@entity65 and @entity66 compared the tweets of professional pundits - celebrities with verified @entity9 accounts - with amateur tweeters that claimed to have some sports expertise in their bio			1
the pair then developed a software program to sort through more than a billion tweets looking for predictions for major sporting events in the @entity14 , such as the @entity15 in february			1
the program pulled out tweets with team names , nicknames and expressions commonly associated with predictions , such as ' beat ' and ' win '			1
words like ' vanquish , ' ' destroy ' and ' annihilate ' posted in @entity85 were considered to be confident words			2
the researchers used these confident words in place of being able to measure loudness online			1
the researchers developed a software program and formula for analysing how confident tweets were			1
they compared this to how accurate the tweets were , how many tweets a user posted each year , how many people favorited their tweets and the number of followers each one had			1
from this they were able to find a mean average and compare professional and amateur tweeters to each other the research found that the professionals were correct with their predictions 47 per cent of the time			1
whereas the amateurs made accurate predictions in 45 per cent of cases			1
however , the professionals were more confident , scoring a .480 confidence rating compared to the amateurs ' .313			2
if a professional pundit accurately predicted every game of the baseball playoffs and series , the authors estimated his or her @entity9 following would increase 3.4 per centr while an amateur would get 7.3 per cent more followers			0
a confident professional would increase his or her following by nearly 17 per cent , whereas a ' loud ' amateur would get 20 per cent more followers			2
more than a billion tweets were analysed during @entity14 sporting events , including the @entity15 , so researchers could test whether being confident , or being accurate , was the key to @entity9 popularity and influence			1
the study found that the ' louder ' people tweeted , the more followers they gained despite only being able to correctly predict the scores in less than half of cases the authors claim that this shows people are more willing to trust ' loud ' amateurs , despite their supposed lack of authority on the subject , than ' loud ' professionals			1
@entity65 said : ' in a perfect world , you want to be accurate and confident			2
' but if you had to pick , being confident will get you more followers , get you more demand			0
' they 're trading away some of their accuracy			0
'' i might not be right all the time but i can yell louder than this other guy			0
' " @entity66 and @entity65 added that tweeters get a better audience through confidence and the excitement it generates			0
researchers @entity161 , left , and @entity66 from @entity5 claim that this shows people are more willing to trust ' loud ' amateurs , despite their supposed lack of authority on the subject , than ' loud ' professionals a study by market research agency @entity168 found that almost 40 per cent of tweets contain ' pointless babble ' such as ‘ i ’m eating a sandwich ’			1
almost as many tweets were purely ‘ conversational ’ - like a text message			0
and just 8.7 per cent of all tweets were deemed of ‘ value ’ with worthwhile news content			0
the remaining 9.6 per cent of tweets were classed as self promotion and spam			0
@entity66 added : ' there is some psychological literature on the idea that people hate uncertainty			0
' the fact that people do n't like uncertainty would suggest that they do n't like the idea of a person standing up there and saying , ' i 'm only 90 percent sure			0
' " @entity65 concluded : ' i like to think of it like a roulette wheel			0
' if you have somebody just placing bets , that person is kind of boring			0
but if you have someone going , ' oh , yeah ! it 's red ! ' and they are confident , that 's the person that you are interested in			0
' @entity66 originally wanted to test the accuracy of stock market pundits , based on tweets from @entity208 host @entity207 , whom @entity65 called ' the yelling genius that he thinks he is			2
' yet the pair realised that stock predictions do n't have a set date in which a prediction comes true , and they were unable to prove when a pundit had been right or wrong			0
the pair presented their findings earlier this year at the 50th @entity218 .			0

researchers analysed more than a billion tweets from pundits during @entity14 sporting events
found that being confident makes you more popular than being right
the pundits and amateurs studied made a similar number of correct predictions , yet those who were ' louder ' and more confident were seen to be more trustworthy and popular
