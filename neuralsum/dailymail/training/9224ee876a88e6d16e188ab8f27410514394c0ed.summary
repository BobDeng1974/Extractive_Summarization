by @entity0 published : 20:58 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 20:59 est , 6 march 2014 light entertainment had @entity3			1
nineteenth century homicide had @entity5			1
twenty - first century @entity6 has @entity7 and @entity8			1
there they sat at a select committee , these two pillars of political consensus , these two gummer - uppers of the works			0
@entity7 is a cabinet office minister			2
sir @entity8 is the cabinet secretary			2
they were talking to the @entity16 about fixed - term parliaments			1
this committee is a stodgy pudding			0
its chairman , mono - drone @entity20 ( lab , @entity22 ) , is devoted to the notion of responsible – not the same as responsive – government			2
cabinet office minister @entity7 ( left ) and sir @entity8 , the cabinet secretary , talked to the @entity16 about fixed - term parliaments yesterday notices announced that the committee is ‘ piloting paperless working ’ ; yet documents were strewn here and there			1
as with much in @entity6 , paperless working is a work in progress			2
@entity34 ( lab , @entity35 ) let slip that his @entity37 colleague @entity36 had described @entity38 and @entity8 as ‘ a politician who wants to be a civil servant and a civil servant who wants to be a politician ’			1
@entity43 ! mr @entity7 , who may have stepped straight from restoration comedy , responded with an ‘ egad , how droll , sir ’ face			1
sir @entity8 ’s delight was less evident			2
close - mown hairdo , rimless @entity51 spectacles , pale , petite hands : it is a look that manages to be both antiseptic and diseased			0
you might not want sir @entity8 to be your anaesthetist			2
fixed - term parliaments , they thought , were marvellous			1
we heard much of ‘ stability ’ and ‘ good order ’			2
fixed terms allowed for ‘ planning ’			1
the machine of government loves fixed terms			0
mr @entity7 is now so intellectual that he may not even carry his own @entity67 folder			2
he was accompanied by a flunkey who ferried it for him			0
the fellow wore a tie with a motif of white elephants			0
no one on the committee bridled at fixed - term parliaments			1
no one made the point , ‘ hang on , fixed terms are profoundly unparliamentary for they prevent mps voting a government out of office ’			1
@entity36 ( pictured ) had described @entity38 and @entity8 as ' a politician who wants to be a civil servant and a civil servant who wants to be a politician ' mr @entity7 ( whose voice is now indistinguishable from that of the late @entity88 , who played sir @entity89 in ‘ yes minister ’ ) was able to get away with the blithe insistence ‘ i ’m a real believer in democracy ’ quite unmocked			1
a vote of no confidence in the @entity96 was once enough to topple a prime minister			0
how fares that principle in fixed - term parliaments ? @entity101 ( @entity102 ) wondered if @entity103 should be admitted to the arrangement whereby @entity106 parties have access to civil servants just before a general election			1
quite why mr @entity101 , a @entity110 , was pressing this argument , is not clear			0
is he about to defect ? after @entity115 ’s peculiar , @entity114 remarks about feeling like a foreigner on @entity118 trains , one hopes the decent mr @entity101 might be better than that			0
after @entity115 's peculiar , @entity114 remarks about feeling like a foreigner on @entity118 trains , one hopes the decent @entity101 might be better than that at mention of @entity103 and its baleful @entity123 , mr @entity7 whinneyed			0
sir @entity8 , the cold - blooded goldfish , just blanked the suggestion , saying he was ‘ doubtful but no decision has been taken ’			1
from sir @entity8 ’s lean lips , the word ‘ doubtful ’ sounds as chill as capt @entity131 ’s codpiece			1
the prospect of mixing with the @entity106 immediately before an election was more to sir @entity8 ’s liking			0
a ghostly enthusiasm almost broke through the wintry mask			0
the process , he explained , ‘ allows the politicians to inform the civil service of issues they may not want to make public ’			1
@entity141 blasted gods , was there ever a more succinct expression of the anti-democratic nature of this sinister , sovereignty - fleecing flesh - pimpler @entity8 ? what is the point of a general election campaign if politicians do not tell voters their intentions ? yet here was sir @entity8 , oozing satisfaction that his @entity6 lever pullers , the consensus wallahs , the stiffers and fixers , should know things the electorate must not be told			1
in other news , the @entity162 got to have a vote on whether or not to join @entity165			0
oh , and it was @entity168			0
a special debate was held in @entity170			0
mps made references to it			0
the @entity96 went almost entirely mad about it , cutting the men out of question time			0
the politics of patronising gestures .			0
