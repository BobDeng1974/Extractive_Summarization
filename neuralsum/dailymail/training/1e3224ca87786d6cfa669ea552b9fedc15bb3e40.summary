the last time i encountered escargots they were served up by a @entity4 waiter , sizzling in garlic and herb butter			2
now , one is slithering up the bridge of my nose while five others are being stuck onto other parts of my face by a @entity14 beautician , all secreting snail slime to hopefully smooth out some wrinkles and otherwise give me a younger - than - my - age look			1
that this latest addition to the global beauty and wellness craze — snail facials — should surface in the hills of northern @entity14 is only natural			0
this @entity24 country ranks among the world 's top spa destinations , with massage treatments of every description offered around just about every corner			1
other members of the animal kingdom are also enlisted , including fish at some 4,000 pedicure spas			0
merely another marketing ploy or an effective way to plump up skin in need of repair or rejuvenation ? expert opinions differ			0
the two young @entity14 women reclining next to me at @entity45 's @entity44 sang the praises of helix aspera muller glycoconjugates , snail mucus for short			1
appropriately , given the @entity4 passion for these gastropods , the spa was started last year by two @entity4 who had imported 100 of them from home			0
the colony now boasts more than 30,000 , munching on chemically free carrots , cabbage and aloe on a certified organic farm			0
' we take care of the snails as if they were our family , our babies			2
you can see they look very good , ' says @entity85 , one of the partners , gently applying one to his forearm			0
he does confess to eating escargots ( ' but not mine ' ) , plans to breed some for the table and is currently experimenting to produce ' the perfect snail caviar			0
' a chosen few get plucked from the farm for duty at the spa , where i opted for the 45 - minute @entity98			1
for $ 30 , it 's a bargain compared to the $ 200 customers must shell out at @entity102 's @entity101 , a beauty salon where snail massage made its debut in 2013			2
spas have also opened in @entity107 and @entity108 , and the @entity4 duo are expanding to @entity110 next month			0
given its novelty , @entity45 public health inspectors last month descended on the spa to determine whether the treatment was safe and if imported snails — officially classified as ' alien creatures ' — might prove harmful to local species			1
results of the investigation have not yet been released			0
budget beauty : a 45 - minute facial at the @entity44 costs $ 30 - a bargain compared to the $ 200 customers must shell out at @entity102 's @entity101 , a beauty salon where snail massage made its debut in 2013 tried and tested : while the facials are new , the use of snail mucus is said to date back to ancient @entity131 , when @entity132 reportedly crushed snails and sour milk as a cure for skin inflammations while the facials are new , concoctions made from snail mucus are said to date back to ancient @entity131 , when the great physician hippocrates reportedly crushed snails and sour milk as a cure for skin inflammations			1
in recent times , the @entity4 have turned this essence of escargot into assorted creams and lotions			0
the fluid , exuded by snails when under stress , is known to contain beneficial nutrients and antioxidants , but @entity110 - based dr. @entity152 and other dermatologists say that there has been no significant scientific research on how these actually work when applied to the skin			1
@entity85 , a manager in @entity4 's nuclear power sector before falling in love with @entity45 some years ago , says his all - natural line of snail products , @entity162 , acts against burns , acne , stretch marks , scars and aging			1
the two women next to me concurred			0
@entity172 na @entity170 , a 22 - year - old recent university graduate , said she had earlier tried laser and other techno - treatments but after some research decided that ' natural therapy ' was better			2
she said snails helped clear her acne when she was stressed during her studies			2
lettuce help you ... @entity182 , or snail mucus , is believed to contain antioxidants slimy business : @entity85 , co-owner of the @entity44 , pictured on his gastropod farm in @entity45 ' my face is firmer and softer , ' she said			1
' but you do n't get immediate results			0
' like for many , the prospect of having my face crawling with slimy hermaphrodites ( snails are unisex ) did not immediately appeal			1
although from my own research i decided it might be preferable to another natural therapy — ' uguisu no fun , ' or nightingale feces facial , which has been around in @entity203 for centuries			2
so after being slathered with one of @entity85 's creams , the beautician plopped down the first of half a dozen mollusks on my face			1
a balmy coolness i sensed as they proceeded to slide over my cheeks , furrow through my eyebrows and tickle my lips , taking particular liking to my nose since snails are fond of climbing			1
opening my eyes , i got a macro lens view of one critter perched on my nose tip. its twin , antennae - like feelers were weaving about , possibly seeking an escape route with its tiny eyes			1
the snail 's 14,000 microscopic teeth produced a slight , not unpleasant , scratching when it slid toward my nostrils			2
so if truth be told , i sort of missed my harmless , sensuous sextet when they were dislodged , clinging to my skin with a gentle suction			0
maybe i wo n't eat another escargot again .			0

the 45 - minute facial at @entity45 's @entity44 sees six of the mollusks placed on the customer 's face
the treatment is not *painful* , the reviewer describing a ' balmy coolness ' . the snails took a particular liking to his nose as they are fond of climbing
