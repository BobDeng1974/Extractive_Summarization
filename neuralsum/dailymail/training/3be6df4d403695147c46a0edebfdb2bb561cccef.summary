@entity1 midfielder @entity0 was feeling optimistic about the club 's chances of finishing in the @entity5 top 10 this season after the 2 - 0 victory over rock - bottom @entity8			1
the win , secured by a fifth - minute @entity11 own - goal and @entity13 's header just before the hour mark , saw the @entity1 rise to seventh place in the table			1
@entity0 provided the corner from which the ball appeared to strike @entity20 's hand before bouncing in off @entity11			1
i just tried to put it into an area and we have good lads attacking it			0
' we are due a little bit of luck and i think it has come off @entity11 in the end			1
things have gone against us in the past but we got one today			0
' if we consistently perform like we did against @entity46 ( a 3 - 1 victory ) and we did today , then we have a hell of a chance of being inside the top 10 , if not further up			2
' but we have to consistently do that			0
we let ourselves slip against @entity52 ( last weekend 's 2 - 1 defeat ) , but if we put a run together , we have got a good chance			1
@entity1 went ahead after @entity11 ( centre ) scored an own goal early in the first half @entity8 's @entity11 ( no 5 ) scores an own goal after a dangerous cross from @entity0 @entity13 heads in @entity1 's second goal from close range @entity0 and @entity63 celebrate after the latter scored @entity1 's second goal ' the good thing is we have a good squad - we have injuries to come back			1
and i think this international break has probably come at a good time for us			0
' @entity0 , holder of 34 senior @entity27 caps , has been out of the @entity27 picture for some time			2
and asked about the prospect of earning a recall , the 30 - year - old said : ' i 've said in the past i 'd love to play for @entity27			2
' but i 've got to be honest and realistic - i do n't think that will happen at the minute			2
if it does , that will be brilliant			0
i would love to play			0
but we 'll see what happens			0

@entity1 up to seventh in table after 2 - 0 win over @entity8 at @entity87
@entity11 own goal and @entity13 seal win for @entity1
@entity0 urges team - mates to string a run of results together now
