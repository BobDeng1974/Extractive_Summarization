within hours of posting the image of her oiled - up derri√®re , the internet went to town on creating their own versions of @entity8 's behind			1
from centaurs to docking stations , the online world found the most comical ways of parodying the lewd cover			0
and now an artist famous for immortalising public figures as @entity16 has got in on the act			0
the contemporary artist , illustrator and activist has ' simpsonized ' the reality tv star and her ' iconic booty ' on his blog			0
speaking about his creation , he told @entity41 : ' i like @entity8 and the first thing i thought when i saw the cover was " ok , sexy and bold " but i found nothing brilliant and , allow me to say it , her ass is far too big			1
' if you look closely at the picture , there is no balance and the perspective is very wrong and disproportionate			0
' in my work i have reshaped her booty in order to give harmony and balance			0
i wanted to improve and capture the best of @entity8 's back , without overdoing it			1
i like her but i 'm just terrified about what will happen in a few years when her booty will " collapse "			0
' @entity63 popping : @entity28 @entity27 has transformed mrs @entity21 into a dead ringer for a member of @entity66 and @entity68 's family spot the difference : @entity8 has been subject to much mocking and parodying on social media and this yellow makeover is the latest mythical beast : one internet user turned @entity8 into a beautiful centaur in a hilarious meme - after seeing her naked shoot for @entity78 magazine twitter user @ @entity81 was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the @entity78 image , tweeting his own version with the caption : ' @entity8 looks so much like a centaur in @entity87 , i figured i 'd take it one step further			1
' @entity8 's rear becomes the rump of a horse , turning the reality star into a centaur , who certainly would n't have been booted out of the @entity96			1
the wife of @entity98 was then given the capital treatment by @ @entity100 , who joked that the @entity102 have been given a bootylicious makeover			0

@ @entity125 killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping @entity112 's face onto @entity8 's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming ' @entity130 ! ' food items has also been another way to describe @entity8 's glistening rear ; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons			2
' @entity8 ' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star , and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of @entity144			2
she 's had the yellow touch , too ! @entity146 also gave the @entity147 a @entity23 makeover to celebrate her best style moments guess who ? @entity151 and @entity152 were also transformed by the artist following their wedding this summer			1
