by @entity0 what lengths would you go to to watch your team play during the @entity4 ? according to research , a surprising percentage of football fans would bribe their spouse , postpone their wedding , or even miss the birth of their baby			1
the study also revealed the vast array of superstitions football fans have to ‘ ensure ’ their team wins			1
a survey has revealed how far football fans will go to watch their team play in the @entity4			1
some 7 % would postpone their wedding for a match , while 18 % said they would bribe their partner out of the house			1
@entity25 's first game is against @entity26 on saturday 14 june at the @entity28 stadium in @entity29 ( pictured ) in the research , carried out by @entity33 for @entity34 , 2,000 @entity31 football fans were asked a series of questions			1
the fear of bad luck can be reversed by carrying out rituals like touching wood and throwing salt , according to a study by the @entity43			0
touching wood is the most common superstition in western culture used to reverse bad fortune or undo a ‘ jinx ’ , while other cultures maintain similar practices , like spitting or throwing salt , after someone has tempted fate			0
even people who are n't particularly superstitious often participate in these practices			0

and people believe that negative outcomes are especially likely after a jinx			0
this uncovered the tactics some fans will be using to ensure they do n’t miss a match when the tournament kicks off next week			2
for example , almost one fifth ( 18 per cent ) admitted they would bribe their partner with cash to shop or go out with friends , so they can watch the match undisturbed			1

‘ we usually carry out rituals to help us deal with worries about uncertainty and bring about good luck , ’ said @entity116 , professor of the @entity117 at the @entity118			0
‘ but these superstitions can have a real effect , with research showing that sportsmen ’s rituals , such as wearing lucky boots or tying their laces in a certain way , can focus the mind and actually enhance on - pitch performance			0
