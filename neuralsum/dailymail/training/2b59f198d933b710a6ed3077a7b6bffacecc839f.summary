by @entity0 a real life ' @entity1 ' who worked on a shipyard during @entity4 sneaked a kiss on the lips from president @entity8 during an official visit to the @entity10			1
the kiss took place when the original six ' @entity13 ' made a visit to @entity15 in the hopes of fulfilling one of their dreams , which was actually getting a hug from @entity21			1
but the ladies got a bit more than they bargained for , when in addition to the vice president , president @entity8 entered the oval office , before hugging and kissing the ladies in a row			1
but one of the @entity1 's , as shown in the video , decided to set her sights solely on @entity8 , heading in for a kiss on the lips rather than a straightforward peck on the cheek			1
' i had written a letter to the vice president and in it i said my dream would be to have my picture taken with the two of them in the @entity57 , and i got it			2
' the president and vice president came bursting out of a room and grabbed me and then hugged everyone			0
' another riveter said president @entity8 ' kissed all of us ' during his meeting with the women , with another adding ' and @entity21 did too ! ' the woman who planted the kiss on the president 's lips said : ' i hope @entity70 forgives me for it			1
' @entity72 @entity73 @entity8 's entrance to the room they had been meeting in was a surprise to the women , who had been invited to @entity15 for a week to meet vice president @entity21 one of the women sprung up when @entity8 entered and immediately announced ' i want a hug ! ' before planting a kiss on the lips of the president @entity46 had been writing letters to the @entity10 for 12 years in the hopes of meeting the president , because she felt her and her fellow @entity39 were n't being given enough credit for their services during the war , amid fears that they would n't be around for much longer			1
she finally got her letters answered when vice president @entity21 invited them to the @entity10 for a personal meet and greet , and a week trip to @entity15 she told @entity94 : ' all the military had monuments and recognition and we did n’t get any			1
' in the schools they ’re not even teaching about @entity4 , so if anybody ’s going to remember us , i wanted to be a big bang here — and we ’re having it			2
' they were on the battlefield but we were on the home front			0
' the war would n't have been won without us			0
' the @entity39 who visited the @entity10 , made famous by the iconic poster seen throughout the war , were welders , electricians and drafters at the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115 , during @entity4			1

they spoke of their experiences during the war fondly , but also explained that they were just young ladies trying to make the best of it at the time			2
mrs @entity46 said : ' i was 20 years old and i was having fun			0
' i can claim i was patriotic , but that is n’t quite the way i remember it			0
' i was but other things were taking priority such as fancy underwear and @entity142 records			0
when asked if there would be a monument made in their honor , one @entity39 exclaimed , ' we hope so ! ' regarding a possible statue , mrs @entity46 joked : ' that ’s the next thing we ’ll work on			2
