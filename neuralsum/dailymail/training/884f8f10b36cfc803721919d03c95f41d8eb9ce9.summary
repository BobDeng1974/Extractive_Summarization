one of @entity1 's relatives said he often wore a cowboy hat to avoid detection by @entity5 drones			1
pictured - how the terror leader might have looked in a stetson a secret @entity9 report leaked online on monday provides a series of stunning revelations about the life and death of terror mastermind @entity1 , the long - time @entity14 leader responsible for the 9/11 attacks against the @entity5 in 2001			1
the report , placed online by the @entity18 news network , recounts the testimony of more than 200 witnesses including @entity1 's family members			2
on one occasion during 2002 or 2003 , @entity1 was almost caught while headed to a market with his security guard @entity24 and the guard 's wife @entity25			2
the car he was riding in - it 's unclear who was driving - was pulled over for speeding , but @entity1 ' quickly settled the matter , ' according to @entity25 's testimony , and the @entity14 leader was once again off and running			2
one of @entity1 's relatives said ' the @entity33 , ' as he was known , often ' wore a cowboy hat to avoid detection from above ' by overhead @entity5 drones , and that ' a complete collapse of local governance ' allowed him to hide inside the country for six years before @entity5 president @entity40 gave the order to have him killed in a @entity43 raid			1
that ' kill mission , ' @entity9 's official inquiry declared , was ' a criminal act of murder which was condemned by a number of international lawyers and human rights organizations			2
' ' due process was deliberately denied the victims , ' the commissioners wrote - referring to @entity1 as a victim - ' and their killing was explicitly ordered by the president of the @entity5			1
' the @entity43 raid that killed the @entity14 founder in the town of @entity61 outraged @entity9 officials because they were not told about it beforehand			1
@entity5 officials have said they kept @entity9 in the dark because they were worried that @entity1 would be tipped off			1
may 2 , 2011 marked the end of @entity1 's reign of terror as the leader of @entity14			2
president @entity40 announced that the @entity5 had killed the most - wanted terrorist in an operation led by @entity43 the fact that the compound where @entity1 was hiding was located only about half a mile from @entity9 's equivalent of @entity75 led many in the @entity5 to suspect @entity9 officials of aiding him , although @entity78 never found evidence to back that up			1
the report said it also found no evidence that current or former @entity9 officials helped @entity1 hide , although it could not rule it out completely			2
it said very little is known about the network of support that @entity1 enjoyed in @entity9 , other than the group of family and backers that lived with him in @entity61			1
the report attacked all levels of government , including the powerful army and intelligence services , for failing to detect the terror leader as he lived in six different places in @entity9 over nine years			2
' to summarise , negligence and incompetence to a greater or lesser degree at almost all levels of government are clear , ' said the report , which was based on testimony from more than 200 witnesses , official documents and site visits			0
the criticism of the army and intelligence services was noteworthy in a country where officials often steer clear of taking these powerful organisations to task			0
the commission recommended the government make the report public for fear it would be ignored or suppressed , but that never happened , even though it was completed months ago			0
the report said it was shocking that nobody in the @entity9 government discovered @entity1 while he was living in @entity61 for six years			1
he was in a compound described as ' hardly normal , ' because it was isolated from homes around it , had very high walls and was protected by barbed wire			0
did he get the idea from @entity40 ? @entity1 was in the habit of wearing a cowboy hat in his @entity61 , @entity9 compound because he believed it would shield his identiiy from @entity5 drones thunderclaps or chinook helicopters ? @entity1 and his youngest wife reportedly thought at first that the @entity139 raid 's noises were due to a rainstorm ' the extent of incompetence , to put it mildly , was astounding , if not unbelievable , ' the report said			1
among the dozen of new details in the report is the revelation that @entity1 and his supporters waited to build an unauthorized third story on the compound until after a devastating earthquake hit @entity9 in 2005			1
according to an account given to the @entity154 by his wives , with whom he was able to father four children while he was on the run , he often liked to have an apple and a piece of chocolate when he was feeling weak			0
the @entity161 reports that the terror leader actively encouraged his grandchildren to compete over who could grow the best vegetables			0
it also said the children of one of his @entity9 couriers knew him as ' poor uncle '			0
the child had reportedly asked why he never went out shopping , and was told he was too poor to buy anything			0
of the raid itself , the commission wrote that @entity1 and his youngest wife @entity177 were together in the bedroom when the @entity5 helicopters first arrived			1
' after the evening meal and prayer , ' the account reads , ' @entity177 and the @entity33 retired for the night			0
shortly past midnight , they were awakened by the noise of what at first sounded like a storm			0
' it was n't a cloudburst			0
minutes later , @entity1 lay dead on the floor			0
scene of the ' murder ' ? @entity9 's commission decided that killing ' the victim ' @entity1 in his compound , pictured , was a criminal act since he was executed without due process in a court of law in this now - famous photo , @entity200 national security officials and cabinet members watched the @entity204 raid in real - time as then stalked , found and killed @entity1 the report also explores the case of dr. @entity208 , a @entity9 physician who used his position as a public health vaccination volunteer to attempt to be admitted into @entity1 's compound			1
@entity9 doctor @entity208 helped the @entity5 track down @entity1			1
he was sentenced to 33 years in prison for ' conspiring against the state ' although he failed to get in , @entity208 got a good enough look at the complex system of locks on the front door to help the @entity43 design a specialized package of explosives designed to blow the door off			0
he also provided his @entity222 handlers with crucial information about the voices of the people inside the compound			2
@entity228 ' met with the @entity222 operatives [ assigned to him ] on more than 25 occasions , ' the report concludes , ' and received approximately @entity231 [ rupees ] 10 million from them			0
10 million @entity232 is equal to about $ 100,000			0
the @entity9 government arrested @entity208 and he remains in prison , sentenced to more than three decades behind bars			1
despite the doctor 's key role in the mission 's success , the @entity5 has done little to secure his release			0
' [ @entity241 ] he fact is that he was arrested 3 weeks after the raid during which time the @entity222 could have ferreted him out of the country			1
' @entity18 's release of the commission 's report came on the same day the @entity5 government was exposed for going to great lengths to hide its own collection of information related to the 2011 raid			2
the @entity253 gained access to information from the @entity256 under the @entity257 , but only after the @entity256 acknowledged shifting documents to the @entity222 and purging them from their original files , so it would no longer possess anything it would have to turn over to the news agency .			0

the terror chief was almost caught shortly after the 9/11 attack , said the wife of one of his guards , when their car was stopped for speeding
@entity1 was in the habit of wearing a cowboy hat in his @entity61 compound because he thought it would shield him from @entity5 drones
he spent his last night with his youngest wife , and the two *initially* thought the noise from *approaching* @entity279 helicopters was just a rainstorm
a @entity9 government commission decided that killing @entity1 was an act of ' murder ' - and that he was a ' victim '
@entity1 was so secretive about his compound that he and his *followers* waited until after an earthquake to add a third story to the house
dr. @entity208 , now *imprisoned* in @entity9 for helping the @entity5 , was n't arrested for three weeks following the raid , allowing the @entity222 time to help him escape if @entity5 officials had wanted to help him
