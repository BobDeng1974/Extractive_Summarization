by @entity0 there is growing evidence that obese women are putting additional strain on already under pressure maternity wards			1
a new study , conducted by the @entity7 and to be completed by the end of this year , will measure 15,000 births to obese women across seven @entity12 hospitals			1
the ‘ mum size ’ study will examine the effect of a mother ’s @entity16 on caesarian time , pregnancy complications and their newborn child ’s health			1
putting pressure on a stretched system : anaesthetists are warning that obese women are putting increased pressure on maternity wards and hospitals utilising data already collected by maternity units , the research team will use the available data to study the interaction between mother ’s size and birthing times			1
‘ we have an increasing number of larger women coming through maternity services – there ’s a lot of anecdotal evidence that it 's harder to care for larger women , ’ professor @entity37 , chair of @entity39 at the @entity7 , told @entity40			1
the study will not just be looking at the birthing process itself , but also the follow - on impact children born to overweight mother ’s may have on the overall health system			0
with little currently known about the link between overweight mothers and their child ’s overall health , beyond the fact that sometimes their babies are born at a higher weight , the study will be useful in forecasting neonatal care in the future			2
professor @entity37 is hopeful that the study will assist hospitals in planning the services provided for women having babies			2
ultimately , the study ’s goal is to ‘ look at the association with maternal @entity16 and the outcomes for their kids			1
’ not much known : @entity77 is currently known about the long - term risks faced by children born to obese mothers beyond the more well - known conditions faced by overweight women during pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes , professor @entity37 added that there were also complications during the birthing process			2
overweight women also face an ‘ increased risk of wound infection , the duration of the surgery , the amount of tissue involved and potentially also increased bleeding			0
’ the ' @entity98 size ' study comes as anaesthetists re-examine the guidelines for administering surgery drugs to overweight patients			0
‘ we 've known for a long time that a lot of the drugs we use are affected by the patient 's body size and height , ’ professor @entity37 said			0
‘ we need to alter our drugs , depending on how large a patient is			0
’ but luckily , with @entity113 ’s growing obesity epidemic , professor @entity37 says they ’re getting better at it .			0

utilising already existing data collected by maternity units
anecdotal evidence that larger patients are harder to care for
examining *relationship* between maternal @entity16 and their child 's outcomes
will help plan maternity services for increasing number of obese women
