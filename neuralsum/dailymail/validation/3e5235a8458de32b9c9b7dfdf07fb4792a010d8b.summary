frustrated @entity1 team boss @entity0 was left to reflect on ' a s * * * * y sunday ' and the fear fans will turn off @entity5 after @entity7 ' domination of the season - opening @entity9 @entity8			1
after winning the constructors ' and drivers ' titles for four years from 2010 - 2013 , with @entity13 at the helm , @entity7 have taken up the mantle of @entity5 powerhouse			1
after winning 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors ' crown , and with @entity20 clinching his second championship , the start to 2015 was a breeze for @entity7			1
@entity20 ( right ) and @entity24 finished first and second respectively at the @entity9 @entity8 @entity20 races to victory in @entity27 as @entity7 dominance of @entity5 rolls on the two @entity7 team - mates celebrate their winning start to the new season with some champagne re-live every lap of the @entity27 race @entity20 beat team - mate @entity24 by 1.3secs , with @entity13 third on his debut for @entity38 , but 34.5secs off the pace			1
predicting ' a two - horse race at every grand prix this year ' , @entity0 has called on the @entity42 to act to prevent an @entity5 yawn , and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given @entity1 's past success			1
' when we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - i remember double diffusers were banned , exhausts were moved , flexible bodywork was prohibited , engine mapping mid-season was changed , ' said @entity0 of the steps taken to negate his team 's performance			1
' anything was done , and that was n't just unique to @entity1 , but @entity59 in previous years and @entity60 etcetera			2
' is it healthy to have this situation ? the @entity42 , within the rules , have an equalisation mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at			0
@entity1 chief @entity0 is concerned that @entity7 dominance will be unhealthy for the sport @entity0 's @entity1 team won consecutive titles between 2010 - 2013 with @entity13 behind the wheel @entity1 driver @entity73 was forced to retire early in what was called a 's * * * * y weekend ' by @entity0 ' @entity7 , take nothing away from them , they have done a great job and they have a good car , a fantastic engine , and two very good drivers			1
' the problem is the gap is so big you end up with three - tier racing and that 's not healthy for @entity5			0
' the @entity42 have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of equalisation otherwise i fear the interest will wane			0
' i did n't see @entity7 much on the tv , and i can only imagine that 's because it 's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race			0
' referring to the fact @entity100 star @entity99 conducted the podium ceremony , @entity0 added : ' the highlight for me was seeing @entity99 on the podium ! ' @entity0 's comments were borne out of exasperation at the job power - unit supplier @entity107 have done since the system came into force at the start of last season			1
the hope was @entity107 would have closed the gap to @entity7 over the winter , but instead they appear to have fallen further steps back			0
@entity100 actor @entity99 interviewed winner @entity20 after the race in @entity9 the former governor of @entity118 raises a smile from third placed @entity13 now of @entity38 an angry @entity0 , who saw @entity73 retire on the formation lap with a gearbox issue , said : ' it 's been a tough weekend and a very tough weekend for @entity107			1
' the engine is quite undriveable and you can see and hear that from the comments the drivers are making			0
' they need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly because it 's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in @entity133 in both power and driveability			0
' it 's disappointing and been a s * * * y sunday for us			0
we can only get better and get our heads down and work harder at it			0
