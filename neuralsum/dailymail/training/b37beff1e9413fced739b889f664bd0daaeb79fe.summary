by @entity0 asteroids and comets repeatedly smashed into the early @entity4 and covered the planet 's surface with molten rock during its earliest days , researchers have revealed			1
however , they say there may have been a positive effect - oases of water that could have supported the evolution of life			2
@entity4 formed about 4.5 billion years ago - and it is believed its first billion years were far more dramatic than previously thought			1
for much of its early life , @entity4 and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts , the new research shows the first 500 million years of the @entity4 's life are known as the @entity22			2
although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of @entity4 's history , little is known about it , since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old			1

our planet was hit thousands of times by ' small ' space debris , approximately 9 miles wide , researchers say			0
but occasionally , asteroids larger than 300 miles wide struck the @entity4 ’s surface , vaporising the @entity4 ’s oceans , and filling the atmosphere with steam			1
the meteor that exploded over @entity49 , @entity50 in 2013 was 65 feet wide , and the asteroid that may have killed the dinosaurs was believed to be six miles wide , for comparison			0
' here we provide a new bombardment model of the @entity4 that has been calibrated using existing lunar and terrestrial data , ' the team , led by @entity55 , a planetary scientist at the @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , wrote in @entity63			0
' we find that the surface of the @entity4 was widely reprocessed by impacts through mixing and burial by impact - generated melt			0
' the new model indicates that the @entity4 ’s surface would have been mixed up by impacts that caused its rocks to melt , and gives clues about the extreme conditions that existed when the @entity4 was in its infancy			1
the early @entity4 , showing a surface pummeled by large impacts , resulting in extrusion of deep seated magma onto the surface			2
at the same time , distal portion of the surface could have retained liquid water			0
the history of the @entity4 ( approximately 4.0 to 4.5 billion years ago ) is poorly understood because few known rocks are older than around 3.8 billion years old			1
it is thought that roughly 4.5 billion years ago the @entity4 and @entity84 were being pummelled by asteroids , although the exact timing and magnitude of these impacts , and their effects on @entity4 ’s evolution , are less well known			1
@entity55 and co-authors estimate the early @entity4 ’s impact history , calibrated using the existing data for the @entity84 , which with its heavily cratered surface provides a clear record of the event that bombarded the @entity97 – moon system			1
the new model suggests that the large impacts caused @entity4 ’s surface to be widely reprocessed , a finding that may help to explain the absence of early terrestrial rocks and the age distribution of ancient zircons , minerals which have survived from the @entity22 period			1
the researchers believe that , with few areas on @entity4 escaping untouched by impacts , life emerging during the @entity22 was probably resistant to the extreme conditions that existed at that time			0
the researchers created this animation to show the impacts the researchers discovered that ; the surface of the @entity4 during the @entity22 was heavily affected by very large collisions , by impactors larger than 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) or so — really , really big impactors , ' @entity55 said			0
' when @entity4 has a collision with an object that big , that melts a large volume of the @entity4 's crust and mantle , covering a large fraction of the surface , ' the new findings suggest that @entity4 's surface was buried over and over again by large volumes of molten rock — enough to cover the surface of the @entity4 several times			1
any water vaporized near these impacts ' would rain down again , ' @entity55 said , and ' there may have been quiet tranquil times between collisions — there could have been liquid water on the surface			0
' @entity55 and his colleagues detailed their findings in the july 31 issue of the journal @entity63 .			0

oases of water were left that could have supported the evolution of life
