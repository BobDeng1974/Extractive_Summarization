angry : @entity0 with her son @entity1 , nine , who has been banned from using @entity3 dialect at school children at a primary school in the @entity7 have been told to speak proper @entity8 instead of the @entity3 dialect to halt a ‘ decline in standards ’			1
those who say they ‘ cor do that ’ – ‘ ca n’t do that ’ – will not be punished , but they will be corrected every time they utter an outlawed phrase			1
angry parents criticised the ban at @entity18 in @entity19 , claiming it is ‘ snobbish ’ and ‘ insulting ’			1
a letter posted to parents last week said the school wanted pupils to have the ‘ best start possible ’			1
it added : ‘ recently we asked each class teacher to write a list of the top ten most damaging phrases used by children in the classroom			1
we are introducing a “ zero tolerance ” in the classroom to get children out of the habit of using the phrases on the list			1
’ the @entity3 includes @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , and southern parts of @entity43			2
other words and phrases on the prohibited list include ‘ ay ’ , meaning ‘ pardon ’ , and ‘ i day ’ , meaning ‘ i did n’t ’			1
@entity0 , 30 , whose nine - year - old son @entity1 goes to the school , said staff should be teaching pupils about the @entity3 and its dialect			1
‘ some of my friends have gone on to be doctors and lawyers and i ’m an engineer – [ the accent ] does n’t affect you as a person , ’ she said			2
‘ i think it is patronising and insulting to say that people with a @entity3 accent are disadvantaged			0
all the parents are outraged			1
’ @entity64 , 62 , who has two grandchildren at the school , added : ‘ i was raised here and i ’m proud of the way we speak			1
’ @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity7 , where staff have have drawn up a list of offending @entity3 phrases that have been banned in the classroom here are the phrases pupils at @entity18 , in @entity19 , have been banned from using : 1			1
' they was ' instead of ' they were			0
' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that			1
' ya ' instead of ' you			0
' gon na ' instead of ' going to			0
' @entity81 ' instead of ' was			0
' i day ' instead of ' i did n't			1
' i ai n't ' instead of ' i have n't			1
' @entity83 ' instead of ' something			0
' it wor me ' instead of ' it was n't me			1
' @entity88 ? ' instead of ' pardon ? ' but @entity89 , 31 , who moved to the @entity90 eight years ago and whose seven - year - old son is a pupil , supported the ban , saying : ‘ @entity93 is my second language			0
so for me … it is good if my child speaks @entity93 in the house and not slang picked up at school			1
’ the primary school , which has 592 children aged four to 11 and was judged ‘ good ’ at its last @entity103 inspection , defended the move			1
headteacher @entity105 said : ‘ we value the dialect but we want to encourage children to learn when to use it and when not , like for a job interview			1
’ the @entity3 includes the three @entity111 of @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 and the southern parts of the city of @entity43 , but does not include @entity114			2
headteacher @entity105 said : ' i think we are seeing a decline in standards of @entity93 when children come into school			1
' we are seeing that some children coming in are not able to speak very much at all to be honest			2
' i think some of the changes in society - the amount of time people sit around and talk together and the amount of screen time - seem to be having an effect on how confidently children speak when starting school			1
' we want to pick them up on that and improve their standards in @entity93			0
it is important because it is the foundation of everything			0
the letter staff at @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity7 , sent out to parents ' if they ca n't say it , it is likely they ca n't read it , and even less likely they can write it			1
' we value the dialect but we want to encourage children to learn when to use and when not , like for a job interview			2
it is , of course , fine to use in other situations and we would celebrate that			0
' we know it is a topic lots of people will be interested in , but i 'm positive about it			0
if it starts to get people talking about the issue , that can only be a good thing			0
' we will correct children if they get the words wrong			2
' the school was rated as either good or outstanding in a @entity103 inspection report in 2010			2
the distinctive @entity3 dialect of the ' @entity169 ' is spoken in towns like @entity43 , @entity40 , @entity171 and @entity39 , and can be very confusing to outsiders			0
scholars find it fascinating because it has preserved grammar from @entity8 and even @entity93			0
' @entity177 ' , ' thy ' and ' thou ' are still in use , as is the case in parts of @entity182 and @entity183			0
' @entity184 ' , meaning ' how beist thou ? ' is a common greeting , with the typical answer being ' @entity188 too bah ' , meaning ' i bay n't be too bad '			2
' i have n't seen her ' becomes ' i ay sid ' er '			2
@entity3 dialect often substitutes the word ' ar ' for ' yes '			0
several word pronunciations are also different : ' you ' is pronounced ' yow ' ( pronounced yo with a silent w ) , whereas ' go ' , which is often pronounced ' goo ' or ' gooin '' for ' going ' , is more in line with pronunciations in the @entity7			1
it is also quite common for broad @entity3 speakers to say ' agooin ' instead of ' going '			0
inhabitants are proud to be known as @entity3 ' folk ' and resist hints at any relationship to people living in @entity114 , calling @entity114 ' @entity210 - a - jum ' ( @entity114 's colloquial name is ' @entity212 ' , a corruption of its older name of ' @entity215 ' and hence @entity216 ) or ' @entity217 ' ( missing the g and h out and saying it the way it 's spelt )			0
residents of @entity114 ( ' brummies ' ) meanwhile often refer to their @entity3 neighbours as ' @entity169 ' , a reference to the use of ' @entity226 ' ( or yow 'm ) instead of ' you are ' , and not because they say ' i yam ' instead of ' i am '			2
@entity39 residents often refer to the people of @entity114 as ' @entity221 '			2
also , the town of @entity41 can be pronounced either ' @entity233 ' or ' @entity234 ' , with a strong @entity41 accent considered to be typical ' yam - yam '			0
the strong @entity3 dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past			0
however , a stronger variation of the dialect ( than the one frequently used ) appears to be heard quite often in conversations between older @entity3 folk			0
the word endings with ' en ' are still noticeable in conversation as in ' gooen ' ( going ) , ' callen ' ( calling ) and the vowel ' a ' is pronounced as ' o ' as in ' sond ' ( sand ) , ' hond ' ( hand ) and ' mon ' ( man )			0
other pronunciations are ' winder ' for window , ' fer ' for ' far ' , and ' loff ' for ' laugh ' exactly as @entity254 's @entity93 was spoken			0
local dialect was ( and probably still is to a lesser degree ) quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the @entity3			2
although most outsiders to the @entity3 ca n't tell this difference , @entity3 folk can quiet fiercely defend the difference between the accent			1
here is a glossary of @entity3 vocabulary : @entity270 , @entity269 - @entity268 - a pert young @entity267 , @entity272 - @entity271 - a large @entity273 - a small @entity274 - a gossipy old @entity276 's intestines ( a @entity3 delicacy ) @entity281 - @entity280 - a @entity279 - @entity278 outside @entity283 - a lie , @entity285 items , @entity286 - worry			0

staff at the @entity7 primary have drawn up list offending phrases
they include ' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that ' and ' @entity296 ? '
parents and local residents have branded the move as ' snobbish '
but the school says it wants it children to have ' the best start possible '
