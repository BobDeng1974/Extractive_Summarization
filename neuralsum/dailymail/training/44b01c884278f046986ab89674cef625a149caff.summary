mr @entity0 will also press @entity11 to pass ban on nuclear tests , an initiative which has been in the works for years but has stalled recently			1

' @entity171 ' : mr @entity0 being transported by an armoured limousine which has captured the fascination of the @entity28 media security : police guard the entrance to the area near the @entity17 where mr @entity0 is speaking now he is a much more divisive figure - although his re-election last year was welcomed by most @entity124 , recent revelations about his administration 's spying on internet communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many			0
mr @entity0 's speech tomorrow will inevitably be compared with @entity22 's , which took place on june 26 , 1963 at the @entity189 , a few miles away from the @entity190 which had been under construction over the previous two years			0
@entity22 's speech , considered one of his best , held up @entity81 as a symbol of freedom on the front line of the battle against communism			0
