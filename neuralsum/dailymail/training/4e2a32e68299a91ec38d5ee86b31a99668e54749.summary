the incredible sounds of an ice ‘ cracking ’ and crashing down into water as an iceberg have been recorded by scientists			1
in a video , the moment a chunk of ice splits apart from a larger glacier is watched live by a camera and underwater recording equipment			2
by studying the noises , the team say it will be possible to detect the different ways that glaciers lose ice into the oceans			1
scientists have recorded the sounds of icebergs crashing into the sea ( still image from video shown )			1
the recordings were made at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
they used underwater microphones aboard buoys to get the sounds			1
in a video the ' cracking ' of ice is heard before a chunk crashes down the scientists used underwater microphones aboard buoys to record a variety of iceberg births at the @entity41 in @entity26 , @entity27 during three days in august 2013			1
the recordings were then combined with time - lapse photos of the glacier during the same period			0
by synchronising the sound recordings with the photographs , the researchers discovered that different types of ice loss are associated with distinct rumbles , snaps and splashes			2
salt water is much denser than fresh water , causing icebergs to float			0
as they melt in the ocean , their weight distribution can change , causing some icebergs to flip over completely			0
however , this is an extremely rare occurrence as 90 per cent of any iceberg is below the surface , meaning the balance is rarely in favour of a complete flip			0
when a flip does occur , the consequences can be devastating			0
for instance , larger iceberg flips can trigger tsunamis that can damage nearby ships			0
their research is to be published in the journal @entity76			0
the scientists identified acoustic signatures for three different ways that ice breaks away from a glacier , or calves			2
an ice chunk falls off the leading face of the glacier into the water below			2
then an ice fragment cracks away from that face and slides down it into the water			0
or , alternatively , an underwater ice block detaches from the face beneath the water , then pops up to the sea surface			2
the newly reported findings may give scientists a better understanding of how glaciers lose ice , the study ’s authors write , even when icebergs detach underwater - a difficult - to - observe phenomenon			1
if inexpensive acoustic methods could be used to gain insight into various calving events , they add , that could be important as glaciers around the world continue to crumble and contribute to global sea level rise			0
