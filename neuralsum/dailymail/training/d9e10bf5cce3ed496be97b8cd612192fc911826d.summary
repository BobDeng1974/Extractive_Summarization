by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity3 has the most segregated public schools in the nation , with many black and @entity7 students attending schools with virtually no white classmates , according to a report released wednesday			1
the report by the @entity12 at the @entity13 at @entity14 looks at enrollment trends from 1989 to 2010			0
in @entity17 , the largest school system in the @entity19 with 1.1 million pupils , the study notes that many of the charter schools created over the last dozen years are among the least diverse of all , with less than 1 per cent white enrollment at 73 per cent of charter schools			1
there 's also a marked difference at the city 's nine specialized schools , designed to prepare students for college			2
anyone living @entity17 can attend these schools , but they must get a high score on a standardized exam administered in the eighth grade			1
alike : a new report by the @entity12 revealed that @entity3 's public schools are the most segregated in the nation			0
above a chart showing the uniformity in race at public schools at elite @entity45 in lower @entity46 , just seven black students and 21 @entity7 students were admitted this year compared to the 164 white students and 680 @entity49 students			1
it was the same story at @entity51 , which admitted 557 @entity49 students , 252 white students , 50 latinos and 18 black students , according to data reported in @entity57			1
' to create a whole new system that 's even worse than what you 've got really takes some effort , ' said @entity62 , co-director of the @entity12 and an author of the report			0
he and his fellow researchers say segregation has the effect of concentrating black and @entity7 students in schools with high ratios of poor students compared with the statewide average			1
black and @entity7 students who attend schools that are integrated by race and income level perform significantly better than their peers in segregated schools , the authors note			1
the study suggests that @entity3 's segregation is largely due to housing patterns but that it could be mitigated through policies intended to promote diversity			2
separation : @entity46 's @entity45 is one of the most segregated schools in @entity3 , with just 8 black students admitted to the college preparatory this year			1
above , students leave the lower @entity46 campus on march 25 elite : @entity45 is one of @entity17 's nine specialized schools			1
any @entity17 resident can attend the school , but they must secure a high score on an eighth grade placement exam ' in the 30 years i have been researching schools , @entity3 has consistently been one of the most segregated states in the nation — no @entity104 state comes close to @entity3 , ' @entity62 said			1
other states with highly segregated schools include @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , according to the @entity12			0
in @entity3 , about half of the state 's public school students were from low - income families in 2010 , the report says , but the typical black or @entity7 student attended a school where close to 70 per cent of classmates were low - income			1
the typical white student went to a school where just 30 per cent of classmates were low - income			2
' for @entity3 to have a favorable multiracial future both socially and economically , it is absolutely urgent that its leaders and citizens understand both the values of diversity and the harms of inequality , ' the study 's authors say			0
@entity17 @entity133 spokesman @entity132 did not address the findings of the report , but said , ' we believe in diverse classrooms in which students interact and grow through personal relationships with those of different backgrounds			2
' in this dec. 3 , 2013 file photo , @entity142 , center , principal of @entity144 , teaches 10th and 11th graders in his @entity147 in the @entity148 of @entity3 state education commissioner @entity149 called the findings troubling and added , ' the department has supported over the years various initiatives aimed at improving school integration and school socioeconomic integration , but there 's clearly a lot of work that needs to be done — not just in @entity3 but around the country			0
' the report , which used @entity19 @entity133 statistics , also noted increasing segregation in upstate cities including @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
in the @entity165 metropolitan area , the report says , the number of black students increased by 4 per cent between 1989 and 2010 , but black isolation increased dramatically			1
in 1989 the typical black student went to a school that was one - third black , but in 2010 the typical black student went to a school that was nearly half black			0
@entity174 , a @entity175 education professor , said it 's disturbing that policy makers have focused so little on racial integration in recent years			0
desegregation : institutionalized segregation in @entity19 's schools became illegal with the @entity183 decision in @entity184			0
above , @entity184 attends her new , majority - white , school in september 1954 ' we 've been talking about reforming schools in @entity3 and elsewhere			2
this issue was never addressed , ' @entity174 said			0
he added , ' when you concentrate the neediest kids together in under - resourced schools they tend not to do very well			0
' the @entity194 report recommends that state and local education agencies develop policies aimed at reducing racial isolation and promoting diverse schools			0
the report suggests voluntary desegregation programs in upstate cities like @entity164 , where low - income populations are surrounded by more affluent communities			2
in @entity17 , @entity62 said , a system of unscreened ' choice ' schools would foster more diversity than the current @entity17 high school choice system , which sees entrance tests at top schools excluding most black and @entity7 students			1
' if you just offer choice , the people with the best information will get into the best schools , ' he said			0
@entity218 , the mother of two students at @entity220 169 in the @entity221 , which has about 75 per cent black and 19 per cent @entity7 students , said she feels the school is ' excellent ' but she would like to see more diversity			2
' i do feel that it would be great for our children and other children to be exposed to other cultures , ' @entity226 said			0
' you 're more knowledgeable and things are not mysterious to you as you get older			0

the segregation is most prominent in @entity17 charter schools where white students account for just 1 per cent of enrollment
there is also a growing *disparity* in the @entity243 cities of @entity165 , @entity163 and @entity164
the researchers suggest *lawmakers* push policies to allow students to chose which schools they wish to attend , without placement exams
in @entity17 , students can chose which school they go to but must get a certain score on an 8th grade exam to attend college preparatory schools
@entity258 reports that just seven black students were admitted to elite @entity45 this year
