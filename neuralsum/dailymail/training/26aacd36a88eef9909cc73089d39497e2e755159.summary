a man who was one of @entity2 's fattest teenagers lost 17st by working out - but now says the @entity3 wo n't remove his excess skin because his muscles mean he 's still ' too heavy '			1
@entity6 , 20 , weighed an astonishing 28st when he was 16 and he was so fat his ribs began to ache			1

@entity6 ( pictured when he was 17 and weighed 28st ) piled on the pounds on a diet of takeaways and junk food to become one of @entity2 's fattest teenagers mr @entity6 than started dieting and exercising and lost 17st meaning he weighed a healthy 11st determined to turn his life around , mr @entity6 began going to the gym and shed an incredible 17st			1
he dropped to 11st and then put another 2st on by doing weight training and becoming very muscular			1
but mr @entity6 claims he has now been denied surgery to remove his excess skin three times because his muscular frame is so heavy he is classified as overweight			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ because of my fitness regime i still have a @entity27 over 25 - the limit for what 's considered “ healthy ” - because of muscle weight			1
‘ i 'm being penalised now because i 'm too fit , so i 've had to start shedding muscle weight now to get the operation			2
‘ it 's wreaked havoc on my confidence , i should be enjoying my weight loss but instead i feel paranoid about the excess skin i still have			1
’ as a result of his weight loss , mr @entity6 has been left with folds of unsightly excess skin on his stomach the @entity43 ( @entity44 ) said it does not have any clinical data about mr @entity6 to be able to make a decision on his individual case however , mr @entity6 says the @entity3 will not pay for him to have surgery to remove his excess skin because he is so muscular that his @entity27 still classifies him as overweight mr @entity6 , of @entity50 , @entity51 , ballooned after a diet of takeaways and five years sitting in his room playing on the @entity55			1
but after realising it was time to change , he went on a diet and started going to the gym			1
mr @entity6 , who lives at home with his mother @entity60 and is currently looking for work , has lost so much weight that he now carries folds of excess skin which he is desperate to get removed			1

he said : ‘ i was overweight from a baby			2
it got the point where my ribs and bones were beginning to ache and i just thought enough was enough			1
‘ i tried the @entity74 [ a low calorie diet made up of branded shakes , bars , soups and porridge ] for a couple of years but it started to make me ill. since then i 've eaten nothing but brown rice , porridge and chicken for two years			2
mr @entity6 says the excess skin is making him depressed and that it is preventing him enjoying his weight loss mr @entity6 is now trying to lose some of his muscle so that he weighs less and can have the surgery ‘ before that , i was eating typical junk food , lots of crisps and @entity93 takeaways			1
my bones were hurting and it ached just to bend down to tie my laces			0
‘ it took a lot of willpower , but i became driven from day one after seeing results overnight			0
also , i just really wanted to prove others wrong and do something beneficial for myself			0
it 's good to have goals			0
‘ i started going to the gym to lose weight and just loved it			2
now i go five times a week and put everything else second			0
‘ although , i have had to stop going so much to lose muscle weight to get this operation			0
’ his mother @entity60 said : ‘ he has worked so hard at the gym and is so disappointed			0
he 's only 20 so has n’t had a life yet			0
‘ he wanted to lose weight for his own health			0
‘ he ’s so depressed because he has worked so hard , he hardly dare go out			0
it ’s painful and his clothes pinch			0
i think the whole thing is really unfair			0
’ mr @entity6 ( pictured before his weight loss ) has shrunk from a 58ins to 30ins waist and he has gone from needing a 4xl t - shirt to wearing a medium mr @entity6 added : ‘ i 've been staying in a lot since losing my weight			2
the skin has affected my confidence and made it hard for me to get a job			0
‘ there was even an occasion on a rare night out where a girl saw my excess skin and laughed and ran away			1
’ the @entity43 ( @entity44 ) said it does not have any clinical data about mr @entity6 to be able to make a decision on his individual case			2
a spokesman added : ‘ we can commission surgery but it will depend on the individual 's circumstances			0
‘ we would advise that he goes to see his gp as there is funding available to pay for surgery following extreme weight loss but there are criteria to meet			2
‘ he needs to discuss his situation and that would be the best starting point			0
’ a spokesperson explained that the @entity43 does not usually pay for this type of surgery but that it can be considered in exceptional circumstances			2
he said that the extremity of mr @entity6 's weight loss means that he could , potentially , qualify but that he would have to maintain a steady weight for two years before he would be considered for surgery .			1
