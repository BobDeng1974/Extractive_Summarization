by @entity0 @entity1 was forced to wait outside @entity4 's @entity3 surgery because poorly toddler @entity5 was crying ' too loudly ' a young mother was forced to leave a doctor 's waiting room after staff claimed her sickly toddler was crying ' too loudly '			1
@entity1 , 26 , and her poorly 16 - month - old daughter , @entity5 , were ordered to wait by a busy road outside the surgery after booking an emergency appointment			1
miss @entity1 said she burst into tears as she and distressed @entity5 left the practice on a receptionist 's instructions			1
miss @entity1 , a school cleaner and self - employed hairdresser , said : ' i felt so humiliated , it was awful			2
' we were thrown out of the waiting room - the receptionist said ‘ you 're making too much noise '			0
i could n't believe it and asked if she was joking , but she said ‘ no '			0
' the worried mother - of - one had phoned the surgery after spotting blistering on the roof of @entity5 's mouth and was told to bring her ' straight in '			1
but after the mother and daughter were forced to wait more than 20 minutes past their time slot , @entity5 started crying and staff told them to leave the premises because they were making too much noise			1
miss @entity1 , who lives in @entity4 , @entity42 with her partner @entity43 , said she was humiliated by the incident at the city 's @entity45			1
she said : ' @entity5 had been unwell with a temperature for days and , when i noticed blistering on the roof of her mouth , i rang the surgery			1
' they gave me an emergency appointment and i was told to bring her straight in			0
after a good 20 minute wait past the time slot , @entity5 got distressed and started screaming and we were told to wait outside			1
miss @entity1 says her and her daughter 's ' humiliating ' treatment by surgery staff left her in tears ' i could feel myself welling up			1
it was absolutely humiliating , so i just picked @entity5 up and walked outside and burst into tears			1
' when they 'd told me to take her down for an emergency appointment i thought we would be rushed straight in , especially given a child is involved			2
' as they stood outside in rush - hour traffic at 5.30pm , miss @entity1 decided she was too embarrassed to go back in and cancelled her appointment			1
they had originally been booked in to be seen at 5.10pm			0
she later took @entity5 to be seen by @entity70 's out - of - hours team instead , where medics discovered she was suffering from a viral infection			2
miss @entity1 added : ' being told to leave was so utterly humiliating i just could not face going back into the surgery afterwards			2
' if that 's the surgery 's policy , the situation needs to be dealt with			2
waiting outside with a sick child is not an option - it 's not fair on parents or children			2
the manager of @entity45 in @entity4 has since apologised for miss @entity1 's treatment ' if the practice feel that strongly about noise , they need to consider having a child only waiting room			1
' it 's virtually impossible to tell a 16 - month - old to sit down and be quiet , they 're too young to understand			0
another patient , who was shocked as the mother and child were ejected from the @entity96 's practice , branded the move ‘ disgraceful '			1
@entity98 said : ' i could n't believe what was happening and really felt for them			0
there were only two other people in the waiting room who did n't seem bothered by having @entity5 there			2
' anyone with small kids understands they scream when they 're ill - it 's just the way it is			0
it was disgraceful and really out of order			0
' @entity3 practice manager @entity112 today apologised and said improvements would be made following the incident			0
not wanting to stand outside with a sick child , miss @entity1 took @entity5 to @entity116 , where the toddler was diagnosed with a viral infection in a statement today , she said : ' @entity3 practice prides itself on being a family - oriented practice where patients of all ages are welcome			1
' we have to consider the needs of all our patients in our waiting rooms - some of whom may be very ill or frail - and endeavour to maintain a calm and safe environment			0
' we may , rarely , have to intervene when a small child is running around the corridor and waiting room			0
' nevertheless , both the receptionist and the practice are very upset and sorry that this incident has caused distress to one of our patients			0
' i personally apologised by telephone when ms @entity1 rang that evening and , again , to her partner the following day			0
' it is never our intention to upset or cause embarrassment to any of our patients			0
we have discussed , as a practice , the way this incident was handled and agreed improved ways of dealing with similar situations in the future			0

worried mother @entity1 brought in daughter @entity5 after days of illness
she became *concerned* after spotting blisters on the roof of @entity5 's mouth
the pair were then forced to wait well beyond their appointment time
when poorly @entity5 started crying , surgery staff ordered them to wait outside
in tears and not wanting to stand by road , mother took child to *hospital*
their treatment has been *slammed* by fellow patients as ' disgraceful '
surgery apologises but says it was considering ' needs of all patients '
