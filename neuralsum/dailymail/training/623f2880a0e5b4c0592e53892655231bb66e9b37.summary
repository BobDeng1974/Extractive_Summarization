‘ we are never going to be able to replace him but we will fight for justice for @entity17 , ’ mr @entity32 said			2
‘ it could so easily have been a woman carrying a baby			1
’ mrs @entity13 , who was appalled at the attack , said she had since closed her business , @entity41 , and planned to have her dogs , thought to be bull mastiffs , destroyed			1

our son has just left home and @entity17 became our new baby			2

i have hardly slept since because as soon as i fall asleep i relive it all			0
’ mrs @entity1 , who now has her arm in a sling after hurting it as she wrestled with the dogs , phoned her husband , who rushed to the shop			1
