by @entity0 @entity1 has announced plans to build a super-heavy carrier rocket that could propel its cosmonauts to @entity5			1
the rocket will rival @entity8 's @entity7 ( @entity7 ) which is expected to come in two variants capable of lifting 70 and 130 tonnes into orbit			1
construction of the first stage of @entity1 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway , according to @entity14 chief @entity13			1
the @entity20 has announced plans to o build a super-heavy carrier rocket that will propel its cosmonauts to @entity5 the second stage is to build a carrier rocket capable of lifting from 100 to 120 tonnes of payload into low - earth orbit			1
meanwhile , @entity8 has said the first test flight of the smaller sls design is scheduled for 2017			2
last year , @entity1 said that it will develop new huge rockets for manned flights to the moon and @entity5 , by 2030 – the same year that @entity8 is aiming for the red planet			1
@entity33 reports that a working group has looked at proposals for a heavy - lift rocket , including the revival of the @entity38			0
how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity41 rockets than launched man to the @entity43			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity1 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			2
however construction of the first stage of @entity1 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway super-sized plans : @entity13 , right , head of the @entity14 , or @entity14 , said the second stage is to build a carrier rocket capable of lifting from 100 to 120 tonnes of payload into low - earth orbit			1
in this image he is shaking hands with @entity59 astronaut @entity58 , left the @entity20 's space - age boasts come less than three years after the @entity59 was forced to start hitching flights on @entity1 rockets			2
@entity8 ended its space shuttle programme in 2011 and has faced years of funding cuts			2
just two weeks ago a @entity18 rocket carried two @entity1 cosmonauts and a @entity59 astronaut to the @entity19 ( above ) , despite the crisis in @entity69			2
but there could be hope of a new space race - as @entity8 announced earlier this month of hopes to land humans on @entity5 within 20 years			1
energia is the highest payload rocket ever built in @entity1 but the project was scrapped 20 years ago during the country ’s economic crisis			2
it is n't just the red planet that @entity1 is planning to conquer			0
earlier this month , deputy premier @entity82 said : ' we are coming to the moon forever			0
' in an article in the government 's own newspaper headlined ' @entity89 ' , he spoke of targeting @entity5 and other ' space objects ' as future priorities			0
' flights to @entity5 and asteroids in our view do not contradict exploration of the moon , but in many senses imply this process			0
' he wrote of ' colonisation of the moon and near - moon space '			0
in the next 50 years , manned flights are unlikely beyond ' the space between @entity106 and @entity5 ' but ' it is quite possible to speak about exploration of @entity5 , flights to asteroids and flights to @entity5 '			0
currently , @entity1 has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - by the end of the decade			1
the first mission , the long - delayed @entity117 - 25 , is slated for launch in 2016 , to research the moon 's south pole			1
moon mission : @entity122 ( left ) looks at exhibits as he visits the @entity124 in @entity1			0
currently , @entity1 has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - by the end of the decade the next two missions will include an orbiter to monitor the moon in 2018 , and a year later a polar lander with a drill will search for water ice			1
by 2040 , @entity1 plans to create a lunar base for long - term missions to the @entity136 's natural satellite			1
@entity82 said that the moon is the only realistic source to obtain water , minerals and other resources for future space missions			0
a lunar laboratory complex will also be used for testing new space technologies .			0

@entity14 chief said construction of first stage of rocket is underway
second stage is to build a rocket capable of lifting 120 tonnes into space
it will rival @entity8 's @entity7 scheduled to launch in 2017
earlier this month , @entity1 said that by 2040 , it plans to create a lunar base for long - term missions to the moon
