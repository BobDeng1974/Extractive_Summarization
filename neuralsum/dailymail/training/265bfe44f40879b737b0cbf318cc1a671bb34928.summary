@entity0 demonstrated their determination to hang on to their @entity3 crown with a hard - fought 21 - 6 win over @entity5 that lifts them into second place in the table			1
the @entity0 played like champions to establish a 14 - 0 interval lead and withstood a tremendous second - half fightback from the @entity5 to secure only their second win in five games in front of a @entity3 best attendance of 20,265 at the @entity16			1
@entity5 tasted glory with their long - awaited @entity19 success at @entity20 a fortnight ago but a fourth successive league defeat leaves them trailing in sixth place with one round left of the regular season and with much to do if they are to complete the elusive double			1
@entity28 : @entity0 kept up the pressure on @entity30 with a hard - fought win over @entity5 the @entity5 were still without evergreen stalwarts @entity33 and @entity34 and they had centre @entity35 making his first appearance of the season in place of the suspended @entity40			1
@entity0 coach @entity41 welcomed back full - back @entity42 and second rower @entity44 but was forced into a late change when centre @entity47 pulled out through illness , the versatile @entity50 taking his place			2
@entity41 also sprung a surprise by recalling 19 - year - old wing sensation @entity53 after a two - month absence and it was he who opened the scoring on 12 minutes			0
@entity42 was in full flight for the line when @entity5 ' veteran prop @entity59 cut him down with a last - ditch tackle but in the next set @entity53 got on the end of stand - off @entity64 's slide - rule kick to score his 20th try of the season on only his 23rd appearance			2
scrum - half @entity68 added the conversion , the first of four successsful kicks at goal , and picked off a forced pass by @entity5 ' under - fire full - back @entity75 to race 30 metres for @entity0 's second try on 22 minutes			1
@entity68 kicked his second conversion and , despite losing his footing , added a penalty on the stroke of half - time to stretch his side 's lead to a 14 - 0 , which was a fair reflection of the play in the opening 40 minutes			0
dejected : @entity5 players looked dejected after their defeat , the fourth they have suffered in a row @entity75 , under an investigation for alleged homophobic abuse , was roundly booed by the @entity0 fans with every touch but he responded well to his blunder and was at the heart of the @entity5 ' limited attacking opportunities			1
they went closest to scoring when second rower @entity100 weaved his way to within a couple of feet of the line but generally failed to trouble the @entity107 defence up to the break			0
they were the first to score in the second half but it came in fortuitous fashion after @entity0 passing broke down on halfway			0
@entity35 hacked the ball ahead and when @entity116 beat his @entity118 team - mate @entity117 to the loose ball @entity120 was in support to race over at the corner			0
@entity124 's superb conversion made it 14 - 6 and the @entity125 were suddenly full of confidence			1
a run of three successive penalties enabled them to pile the pressure on the home side but , with skipper @entity134 setting a magnificent example , their defence held firm			0
when @entity0 got their second wind , a dash from industrious hooker @entity140 got centre @entity141 charging for the line and , although the home fans were convinced it was a try , video referee @entity137 ruled the player lost control of the ball			2
@entity124 kept his side in the game with a clever drop - out that enabled his side to regain possession but the telling moment came 10 minutes from the end when strong - running prop @entity155 took @entity134 's short pass to power his way over the winning try			0
@entity68 landed his fourth goal and wrapped up the scoring in the last minute with a drop goal .			0

@entity0 beat @entity5 21 - 6
