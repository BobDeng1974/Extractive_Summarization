by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:24 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 25 february 2013 this week 's eastleigh by - election was triggered by the resignation as mp of @entity5 who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice @entity9 today pleaded with voters to not punish the @entity11 for @entity5 's lies , ahead of the crucial @entity2 by - election			1
with polls showing the contest is on course for a photo finish , mr @entity9 made a whistlestop visit to the constituency of his former @entity21 colleague who quit as an mp after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice			2
the @entity11 leader tried to argue mr @entity5 's private life should not overshadow his achievements as a local mp			1
' it ’s really important to say this , by the way , everyone wants to give @entity5 a kicking , ' he told @entity31			2
' but actually people are telling me locally , whatever he might have done in court , whatever might have happened with his marriage , he was a really excellent local mp who worked with an excellent @entity11 team			1
' mr @entity9 's attempts to use interviews with local media in @entity40 to drum up support ahead of thursday 's vote were overshadowed by the growing scandal of his handling of allegations of inappropriate behaviour by former @entity11 chief executive @entity47			1
mr @entity9 insisted today he had ' nothing to hide ' after admitting he knew of non-specific allegations made by women five years ago			0
the @entity11 had been on course to win the @entity2 seat , but as the @entity47 scandal exploded the polls have narrowed with the @entity55 now ahead			1
support for the @entity58 @entity57 is also growing , suggesting the crunch vote on thursday could turn into a three - cornered fight			1
according to a @entity63 poll published yesterday the @entity61 have a narrow lead of four percentage points over the @entity11 , reversing recent findings that gave @entity9 ’s party a similar advantage			2
support for the @entity55 is now 33 per cent with the @entity11 on 29			1
a previous survey by @entity71 , published on saturday , put the @entity11 five points ahead			0
write caption here according to the @entity63 poll , a surge in @entity57 support has seen them rise to 21 per cent , eight points clear of @entity78 , who seem destined for a humiliating fourth place			1
the by - election has been billed as a ‘ must - win ’ for both mr @entity83 and mr @entity9			0
@entity55 activists have privately expressed pessimism about the prospects of their candidate @entity87 after receiving a hostile reception on doorsteps			0
@entity57 ’s performance is bad news for @entity83 since it suggests the @entity55 risk losing seats across @entity58 where the @entity94 party is leeching votes away from the conservatives			2
@entity57 may even be within striking distance of their first by - election win			2
the @entity71 poll put the @entity11 candidate , @entity101 , on 33 per cent , with the @entity55 on 28 per cent and @entity57 on 21 per cent			1
but analysis by @entity58 polling report ’s @entity103 revealed that those numbers included allocating ‘ do n’t know ’ responses based on how participants voted in 2010 - votes that may not be repeated in the by - election			0
the @entity110 ' today unveiled a billboard in @entity2 protesting against the @entity11 ' position on pensions paid to @entity58 pensioners who choose to live abroad mr @entity103 said if those ‘ do n’t knows ’ are discounted , the @entity11 are only on 31 per cent , the @entity55 on 26 per cent and @entity57 close behind on 25 per cent			1
@entity115 , now minister without portfolio , said it would not be a surprise if the @entity55 lost			0
‘ i always prefer to win by - elections but governments do n’t usually win by - elections , ’ he said			0
‘ if we do lose it , it can hardly be said that it ’s too surprising given we are mid-term , facing difficult problems and obviously this is regarded as essentially a @entity61 government			0
’ @entity55 sources say @entity130 , the former @entity131 who defected to the @entity61 , will be wheeled out tomorrow in a bid to win back votes			0
@entity134 and @entity135 will also travel to @entity2 this week			0
but in a sign that @entity55 may regard the seat as lost , @entity83 will not be returning .			0

@entity11 leader insists despite scandal @entity5 was ' excellent local mp '
