by @entity0 @entity1 was at the centre of a rather embarrassing team orders row in sunday 's @entity4 after he ignored a direct instruction from @entity6 to move over for team - mate @entity7 as the two diced for seventh place			1
the message delivered from the @entity6 pit - wall was humiliating in its delivery , too – reminiscent of @entity12 infamously ordering @entity1 to allow @entity13 to take the lead of the @entity15 – an instruction which ultimately lead to the end of the team order ruling			1
' @entity1 , @entity7 is faster than you			0
do not hold him up , ' was the instruction to @entity1 on sunday – eerily similar to the ' @entity1 , @entity13 is faster than you ' team directive from four years ago			0
off track : @entity1 was ordered to allow @entity7 through - a directive he ignored @entity1 subsequently defended his decision to ignore the order from the pit - wall , but @entity7 argued he would have ' 100 per cent ' caught @entity28 who finished sixth			2
either way , an uncomfortable moment for @entity1 , who , after spending almost a decade of playing second fiddle to @entity32 and then @entity13 at @entity12 , would not have expected the same treatment at @entity6 - particularly to a team - mate only in his second full @entity36 campaign			1
@entity37 completed the perfect hat - trick of pole - position , race victory , and fastest lap for the first time since the @entity43			2
@entity37 's 23rd career win also moved him to 11th on the all - time list alongside the @entity47 @entity46 and one better than 1996 world champion @entity48			1
only @entity49 ( 31 ) , sir @entity50 ( 27 ) and @entity51 ( 25 ) can claim to have won more races as a @entity54 driver			0
jumping for joy : @entity37 celebrates the 23rd win of his @entity36 career following a flawless display it also marked the 100th points ' finish of his career although @entity37 did n't wish to be reminded of that statistic afterwards			1
' i do n't want to hear that kind of stuff because it means i am getting old , ' the 29 - year - old quipped			0
@entity69 appears to have inherited the appalling bad luck which plagued the career of the man he replaced			2
after being thrown out of the results in @entity75 , @entity69 , the replacement for @entity77 at @entity78 , saw an almost certain fourth - placed finish snatched from his grasp after a bumbled pit - stop			0
the botched job on the front - left tyre led to comical scenes in the pit - lane with his @entity78 crew then pushing the stricken @entity75 back to the garage			0
@entity69 then suffered a failure with his front wing which led to a puncture before then having to serve a 10 - second grid penalty for @entity78 's unsafe release			1
all in a matter of laps			0
@entity78 's gaffe also means @entity69 will serve a 10 - place grid penalty at next week 's @entity98			1
it never rains … bad day at the office : @entity69 is wheeled back up the pit - lane after his left - front wheel came loose @entity103 made history on sunday with their first 1 - 2 finish since the @entity106			0
the legendary @entity107 finished ahead of @entity108 by just 0.7seconds at that race in @entity110 almost 60 years ago , but @entity37 's winning margin over @entity112 was rather more emphatic on sunday			0
@entity37 finished over 17 seconds ahead of his team - mate , going some way to disproving theories that the @entity54 racer might not have the tactical nous to cement a championship challenge this year			0
team effort : @entity37 and @entity112 lead the @entity103 post-race celebrations after their 1 - 2 finish in @entity122 ' why is @entity123 ' was tending worldwide on @entity124 after the @entity54 actor was the surprise choice to conduct the post-race podium interviews			1
the job is one normally reserved for a @entity36 legend , but @entity123 , known for his leading role in @entity133 drama @entity131 , turned in a credible performance			2
asking the questions : @entity123 was the surprise choice to conduct the post-race interviews			1

@entity1 ignored @entity6 order in closing stages of @entity142 *gp*
@entity37 secures the 23rd win of his @entity36 career
@entity69 will serve 10 - place grid penalty at @entity98
*sherlock* star @entity123 conducted post-race interviews
