police said he pushed her to the ground in her driveway after she ordered him to stop taking pictures of her car			0
solving the mystery : an @entity57 agent walks on @entity11 's property thursday , passing in front of a shipping container where he may have kept @entity4 hidden for nine months ' i remember thinking that was so over the top , ' @entity9 said			1

' they seemed like they were on the mend , ' @entity152 said			0
' they 've been through a lot obviously , but she 's getting better			0
' on friday , it was revealed that police may have missed an opportunity to rescue @entity4 five months after her disappearance , when they showed up at @entity11 's mobile home to collect his vast arsenal of weapons following the assault arrest			1
@entity11 actually called police and invited them to his home to collect the weapons so he would not be in breach of his bail conditions			0
official records show two officers went round to his property at 9:04pm on march 2013 , stayed for fifteen minutes and then left with his guns			0
what did they find ? investigators at @entity11 's property were photographed on thursday storing evidence in boxes marked ' biohazard ' their visit raises serious questions as it is believed @entity4 was held on his tiny property for the entire nine months since her october disappearance			1

but @entity9 said nothing foreshadowed the kidnapping allegations			2
' you 're always hoping it 's some stranger and that evil does n't live in your midst , ' @entity9 said			0
' certainly nothing he 'd ever done would lead you to believe this is what he would do			0
