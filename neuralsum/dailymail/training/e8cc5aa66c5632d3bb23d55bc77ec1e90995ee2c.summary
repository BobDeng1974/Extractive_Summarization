the @entity0 reported tuesday afternoon that @entity1 , who heads up the @entity3 's tax - exempt division , plans to invoke the @entity4 to the @entity5 in a hearing wednesday before the @entity7			1
the @entity4 provides that @entity9 citizens may not be compelled to offer testimony if telling the truth would incriminate them			2
@entity1 's defense lawyer , @entity12 , wrote to the committee on tuesday that his client would refuse to answer questions related to what she knew about the extra levels of scrutiny applied to conservative nonprofit organizations that applied for tax - exempt status beginning in 2010			1
@entity1 heads the @entity3 's @entity21			1
her lawyer says she will plead the @entity4 on wednesday to avoid answering questions about her agency 's @entity25 scandal during a congressional hearing @entity3 headquarters in @entity28 is fast becoming the epicenter of the @entity25 probe , despite an inspector general report that focused on employees in @entity35 , @entity36 she also will decline to say why she did n’t disclose what she knew to @entity39 , according to the @entity0			0
@entity1 ' has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation , ' @entity12 's letter read , ' but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course			1
' he is asking the oversight committee to excuse @entity1 from testifying , claiming that calling her in a congressional hearing would ' have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her ' since members would not expect her to answer questions			1
@entity53 , a committee spokesman , told @entity54 that ' ms. @entity1 remains under subpoena from chairman @entity56 to appear at tomorrow 's hearing - the @entity7 has a @entity59 obligation to conduct oversight			1
' ' chairman [ @entity61 ] @entity56 remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous @entity3 targeting of @entity9 for their political beliefs			0
' the @entity3 applied special criteria to conservative organizations seeking tax - exempt status , putting them on a ' @entity68 ' ( @entity70 ) list , based on the groups ' names and political philosophies			1
president @entity74 has said he was unaware of the program until may 10 , when excerpts of an @entity3 inspector general report on the practice were leaked to reporters			0
@entity80 , the @entity74 administration 's designated flak - catcher , insists that the president did n't know about the @entity3 targeting tea party groups until he learned about it during a tv news broadcast but @entity80 , the president 's chief spokesman , confirmed monday that senior @entity87 staff , including white house counsel @entity88 and chief of staff @entity89 , knew about the @entity3 's habits as early as april 24 , and chose not to tell @entity74			0
the inspector general report found that @entity1 and other @entity3 were notified in or before june 2011 that some staff in the agency 's @entity35 office were using ' tea party , ' ' patriots ' and other key words to add applicants to the bolo list			2
once on that list , the groups were subjected to additional auditing of their financial practices , their membership and their political activities			0
despite knowing about the program , @entity1 and other senior @entity3 staffers withheld the information from @entity39 despite receiving several requests from @entity87 committees whose members heard from constituents that their tea party groups ' tax - exempt approvals were taking as long as two years to be resolved			1
the @entity116 was among those that specifically asked the @entity3 whether it was inspecting tea party groups more closely than other applicants , including those on the political left			0
under mounting pressure , president @entity74 announced may 15 in the @entity124 of the @entity87 that acting @entity3 commissioner @entity125 would be stepping down			0
it emerged hours later , however , that @entity125 's term as acting commissioner was already scheduled to end in early june @entity1 herself launched her agency 's scandal with a planted question - and - answer exchange during a may 10 @entity134 conference			1
asked the pre-arranged question , @entity1 responded by conceding that her employees had acted inappropriately			2
' instead of referring to the cases as advocacy cases , they actually used case names on this list , ' she told the assembled tax lawyers			0
' they used names like " tea party " or " @entity146 , " and they selected cases simply because the applications had those names in the @entity150 was wrong			0
that was absolutely incorrect , insensitive , and inappropriate — that ’s not how we go about selecting cases for further review			0
' she later claimed that the increase in scrutiny of tea party groups was due to an influx of new applications from right - wing organizations , following the @entity165 's ' @entity164 ' ruling , which opened the floodgates to greater political participation by nonprofit advocacy groups			1
the @entity169 called that claim bogus , however , with the newspaper 's fact checker awarding it a ' four @entity173 ' rating for dishonesty			0
@entity176 : ' between 2010 and 2012 , we started seeing a very big uptick in the number of 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) applications we were receiving , ' @entity1 claimed , but the @entity169 determined that was n't true			2
@entity1 's boss , acting @entity3 commissioner @entity125 , was relieved of his post by treasury secretary @entity186 last week , although the term of his appointment to the job was already scheduled to end in early june			2
other higher - ups inside the @entity3 have not been publicly held accountable for the improper targeting of conservative organizations .			2

@entity1 faces @entity7
due to be quizzed about extra levels of scrutiny applied to conservative nonprofit organisations that applied for tax - exempt status
but her lawyer says she will refuse to answer anything that may incriminate her
