having kept his job on the basis that he provides more entertainment , @entity0 can be quite pleased with this start to the season			2
there was no shortage of incident at @entity9			2
unfortunately for @entity0 and @entity11 , they were on the wrong end of the fun supplied by two red cards , a penalty miss and a winner in the second minute of added time			1
@entity19 new - boy @entity18 settled the derby , sprinting forward from right - back to collect a pass from @entity23 , skip around goalkeeper @entity24 and roll the ball into the net			1
cue delirium from @entity19 fans and familiar grumbles from the @entity31 natives			1
subs : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			2
booked : @entity51 , @entity62			1
@entity19 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity73 8 ; @entity45 6 , @entity74 7 , @entity18 7 , @entity75 6 ; @entity76 6 , @entity77 5 ; @entity78 6 , @entity79 6.5 ( @entity80 61 , 5 ) , @entity81 6 ( @entity82 61 , 6 ) ; @entity83 6 ( @entity23 83 )			1
subs : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88			2
sent off : @entity45 manager : @entity90 7			1
man of the match : @entity73 referee : @entity53 5			1
for @entity18 , it is a dream - like debut after his transfer from @entity97 , having started the game at centre - half and finished as a rampaging full - back			1
‘ i would ’ve been happy with a clean sheet , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ i was n’t expecting to get up the other end and score			2
i ’m not sure i got there , i just made a run inside and it [ the ball ] found me			2
i ’d like to score more goals , so i ’m happy			0
’ for @entity90 , this flattering win was a perfect start to life as @entity110 ’s ninth @entity19 boss in 11 years			1
his team were a man down and under pressure for 33 minutes after @entity45 had been dismissed but before @entity51 was also sent off			1
‘ the important thing is to never give up , ’ said @entity90			0
‘ there are times in football that are difficult to manage but the team believed			0
we kept our offensive players on the pitch			0
this was the signal from the dugout			0
’ @entity11 had been the better team and ought to have been ahead when , after half an hour , @entity61 spun over a dropping ball , connected with a half - volley on the turn and the ball crashed into the hands of @entity45			1
the distance between ball and hand was short and the ball had travelled at incredible speed			0
@entity45 had no chance to adjust but the shot was hurtling towards goal			2
assistant referee @entity138 was flagging but wanted to indicate a corner , rather than a penalty			2
@entity53 , however , once his mind was made up , pointed to the spot and sent off @entity45			1
‘ the card was unfair , ’ said @entity90			0
‘ but the most important thing was the team kept calm and carried on			0
’ back in the game : @entity79 , who started for @entity19 , tries to beat @entity11 forward @entity63 tussle : @entity81 ( left ) and @entity148 grapple for the ball in the early exchanges committed : @entity78 puts in a challenge on @entity11 new boy @entity152 at @entity9 making an impression : @entity45 is challenged byanother @entity11 debutant , @entity62 running away with it : @entity78 beats @entity152 and leaves the @entity11 defender on the turf @entity158 miles @entity11 total 108.5 67.4 @entity59 90 12.4 7.7 @entity61 90 11.5 7.2 @entity62 90 11.1 6.9 @entity19 total 109.8 68.2 @entity78 90 12.6 7.9 @entity77 90 11.5 7.1 @entity159 90 10.8 6.7 @entity90 admitted that he was not so calm on the touchline , however , saying : ‘ yes but it ’s difficult on the line because it ’s impossible to run and it ’s impossible to jump , but the team deserved the three points			1
it was always in our mind , even at 10 v 11 , that it was possible to win			0
’ the excitement at @entity9 was quickly punctured when @entity59 sent @entity73 the wrong way from the spot and rolled his penalty wide			1
@entity0 ’s team continued to create and squander chances — no player was more wasteful than @entity63 — and @entity73 was inspired in the @entity19 goal , making two brilliant second - half saves to deny @entity60 , the second shortly before @entity18 ’s winner			1
the numbers were levelled when @entity51 was sent off for a second yellow card for two innocuous fouls			2
his first was for a nudge on @entity79 on half - way , his second for a block on @entity83 , when the @entity19 striker was looking to be fouled , without support , 25 yards from goal			1
‘ there were three big factors , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ one is not being clinical enough after creating chances			0
then poor @entity59 misses a penalty for the first time in my time at the club			1
then allowing ourselves to go to 10 v 10			0
‘ i ca n’t fault the performance but we were very naive			0
we had enough to win and paid the ultimate price			0
this league will punish you			0
’ as for keeping the owners entertained , he added : ‘ we had 20 attempts on goal and the opposition hardly had any			0
we have n’t deserved to lose			0
we played very well and we have a lot of players to come back			0
on that performance our season will be a good one			0
‘ if they were going to sack me after one game they might as well have done it at the end of last season			0
why wait until now ? ’ @entity216 : the ball hits @entity45 on the arm and referee @entity53 pointed to the spot lonely walk : @entity45 trudges off the @entity9 pitch following his harsh red card bad miss : @entity59 surprisingly puts the penalty wide of @entity73 's right - hand post i do n't believe it : @entity59 's head is in his hands ( right ) after his miss as @entity73 ( left ) celebrates hang on a minute ! a pitch invader takes a free - kick as @entity19 midfielder @entity78 looks on bemused going for the corner : the pitch invader shoots for goal as the players watch in surprise get off : stewards finally restrain the invader and manage to get him off the @entity9 pitch @entity18 diary : the young @entity19 defender begins to celebrate his dramatic late winner for his new club mob rule : @entity19 's players pile on to @entity18 ( obstructed ) as @entity80 ( left ) and @entity159 ( stood up , centre ) celebrate @entity18 scored the winner for @entity19 on his debut ... for more go to our brilliant @entity252			1
