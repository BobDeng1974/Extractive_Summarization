@entity0 will not look to solve their defensive crisis by splashing out more money on new signings in january			2
manager @entity4 and his staff remain perplexed by the defensive performances that have returned just one clean sheet in 18 competitive games			1
they have spent more than £ 60million on @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in the past 18 months and recruited @entity14 and @entity15 on a free transfer and loan respectively but the problems are still painfully evident			1
@entity0 conceded three times against @entity20 and have kept one clean sheet in last 18 matches @entity22 forces a save from @entity24 - one of several chances real had to extend their lead @entity27 ( left ) and £ 20million signing @entity10 have been struggling to forge a strong partnership @entity10 - £ 20million ( july 2014 ) @entity11 - £ 18m ( september 2013 ) @entity12 - £ 12m ( august 2014 ) @entity13 - £ 7m ( september 2013 ) @entity29 ( august 2014 ) @entity30 ( july 2013 ) @entity4 has vowed to work his players harder on the training ground with set pieces a particular achilles heel			1
@entity0 's owners have always backed their manager but bringing in more players now would be considered an extra complication			0
@entity4 is convinced @entity10 can prove a key figure but the @entity40 is struggling to form a solid understanding with @entity27 while @entity24 's confidence in goal is fast diminishing			2
@entity0 defenders look on along with @entity22 ( centre ) as @entity47 's header goes into the net @entity12 ( right ) is one of a number of players signed in the last 18 months to strength the defence there will be potential @entity55 signings offered to @entity0 in the winter market and they will be considered for the summer but the present intention is to work through their growing crisis			1
@entity13 is on loan at @entity61 and , while reports continue to be favourable , he is seen as one for the future			0
academy graduate @entity65 has impressed at @entity66 but may struggle to break through at @entity67 and @entity68 is on loan at @entity70 but has failed to convince @entity4 in the past and is still troubled by niggling injuries			2
the one bright spot is the continued development of teenage centre - back @entity75 but @entity0 staff hope it will be their experienced players who can show their mettle in the time of need			0
buying their way out of trouble is , for now , not an option			0
@entity27 ( right ) has been struggling for form so far this season and @entity0 have conceded frequently			0

@entity0 have spent more than £ 60million on defenders in past 18 months
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all signed
@entity4 is convinced @entity10 can end @entity93 ' defensive woes
@entity0 have kept just one clean sheet in last 18 competitive matches
