@entity0 , 29 , was airlifted back to @entity1 after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in @entity4 medics told yesterday of the stressful and desperate conditions in the makeshift ebola wards where the @entity9 victim worked			1
staff were too scared to come to work at @entity12 government hospital where the floors were left splashed with blood			1
the 350 - bed hospital is a cluster of small cinder - block buildings in the centre of @entity12 , the third largest city in @entity4 and a hot - spot for ebola			1
the isolation units where the afflicted are taken are in temporary covered shelters with concrete floors , plastic sheeting for walls and tin roofs			1
the doctors and nurses wear masks , goggles and impermeable @entity32 safety suits			0
nevertheless , 20 nurses and healthcare workers have died of ebola since the outbreak began			1
loss of concentration brought on by the gruelling workload is blamed for them exposing themselves to the deadly virus			0
@entity43 , an @entity45 doctor and ebola expert who was at the hospital last month , said in one ward of 30 patients ' the floor was splashed with blood , vomit , faeces and urine '			1
ebola sufferers often fall out of bed , he said , creating a decontamination nightmare for medics , who would also have to haul the patients back into bed			1
there were also staff shortages because nurses walked out after not receiving their £ 20 a week hazard pay			2
one nurse who continued working , sister @entity64 , 36 , said : ' no one wants to come close to us , the nurses in the general ward wo n't talk to us , even our families are scared they will catch the virus from us			2
' @entity72 is new to @entity4 and there is much suspicion and mistrust about the hospital			2
there was even a rumour that locals wanted to burn down the @entity12 site , which is in @entity4 's @entity80			1
' they are angry with us , they do n't believe we are trying to help , ' said another nurse			0
@entity85 , an @entity45 professor of microbiology and immunology who has visited the hospital many times , said conditions were getting better			2
' some have set aside their own personal wellbeing and paid the ultimate price			0
we only wish the best for this young @entity9 nurse who put it all on the line			0
' professor @entity85 said the hospital was a decent multi-purpose facility by @entity123 standards but ' with not enough doctors , not enough nurses and not a whole lot of modern equipment '			2
he added : ' working in the ebola wards is very stressful			0
you are dealing with patients that are carrying a very dangerous virus – one mistake and you 'll become infected yourself			0
' if you are working long days , up to 18 hours , day after day , as no doubt this young @entity9 nurse did , you are more likely to make a mistake			0
humans can only maintain that kind of intense concentration for so long			0
' colleagues who have returned from @entity12 recently told him conditions were improving with more cleaners to do decontamination work			1
the hospital deals with 90 ebola cases a week			1
a risk assessment published last month by @entity146 said the current outbreak could raise the danger for @entity9 working in humanitarian and healthcare delivery in affected areas			0
however , the threat to tourists , visitors and expatriates was still considered ' very low if elementary precautions are followed ' .			0
