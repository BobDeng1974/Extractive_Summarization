' he said : ' it specifically targeted people looking for jobs			0
' a decision was made someone applying for a job is perhaps more keen to cooperate and comply with any instructions given by someone that seems to be positively responding to their application by inviting them to download an application pack			1
' in august and early september 2010 a number of adverts appeared on @entity21 advertising various jobs at @entity5 , a rather attractive post you may think			2
' those responding were in return then sent an e-mail pretending to be from the respected @entity119 recruitment agency inviting them ' to fill in that application pack for further consideration			0
' mr @entity92 said : ' although a number of persons had doubts about downloading an application pack , many did so			0
almost immediately there started to appear to be problems with their computers			0
' what in fact happened that application pack was no application pack at all			0
' it was a virus that had been specifically programmed to be released onto the computers once you have clicked on that application and downloaded it			2
' once embedded the software waited until the user tried to access their online bank accounts			0
the unsuspecting user would then be redirected to fake sites ' which looked all the world that it was a genuine bank site they were trying to contact ' before the gang ’s software stole log on details			2
however , he added : ' in late summer and early @entity155 2010 a number of individuals complained to @entity5 that they had applied for job adverts and downloaded an application pack and a virus was released onto their computer			1
' the court heard the suspected fraudsters were originally from @entity13 and were close friends all living in south @entity163 and all were studying or had studied it			0
