by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:48 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 02:05 est , 15 august 2012 it should be a time when you cast aside your predictable workday attire and revel in the freedom to dress down			2
but for @entity8 , going on holiday seems to bring out a determined desire to stay within his sartorial comfort zone			2
at the beginning of his summer break yesterday , the prime minister clung resolutely to the identikit crumpled blue shirt , dark cotton trousers and smart black shoes that have accompanied him on family trips to @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and now @entity22			1
family outing : mr @entity8 and his wife @entity24 enjoy a coffee together today in @entity22 , left , but mr @entity8 clearly needs more imagination with his wardrobe as he wore a very similar shirt just a year ago , top right , while having coffee in @entity31 meanwhile the deputy prime minister ventured out in sandals that looked more suited to heavy - duty hiking than a relaxed stroll in @entity36 – though at least he remembered to take his socks off			1
@entity8 and his wife @entity24 are in @entity22 with their children and looked thrilled to have swapped @entity41 for a pretty pavement cafe in a quaint cobbled street area			2
perhaps heading for a coffee at the beginning of their hols is a @entity8 tradition , as last year in @entity31 they were spotted doing the same thing with the prime minister wearing almost exactly the same outfit			1
@entity54 , with his wife @entity53 , put on some rather heavy duty sandals for a gentle stroll in @entity36 but hopefully this time the prime minister left a tip after last year in @entity58 he managed to fall out with a waitress after stopping for a drink with his wife			1
mr @entity8 made headlines across the world when it emerged he had paid for a 3.10 @entity66 bill with a 50 @entity66 banknote and failed to leave any small change , as is customary in @entity58 bars			0
waitress @entity70 , 27 , failed to recognise the @entity72 resident when he walked in with his wife @entity24 , 40 , and ordered two cappuccinos asking for them to be brought to an outside table			0
the next day he returned to the bar and made amends with the waitress , by leaving a tip on that occasion			0
mr @entity8 left @entity81 with his family yesterday , after the @entity83 came to a close on sunday evening			1
their exact location on @entity22 is currently being kept secret			0
he is expected to return to the @entity81 next week and spend a few days in the office before taking a further short holiday in the @entity81			1
questions were raised yesterday over @entity54 ’s role in the government after he flew away on holiday on the same day as the prime minister , rather than taking charge of the country in his absence			1
as both the prime minister and deputy prime minister began summer breaks in @entity36 , @entity97 was instead left to take the reins			1
the holiday arrangements led mps to question why the @entity105 leader would jet off at the same time as mr @entity8 , with one @entity106 saying it was proof he was not really his deputy			0
foreign secretary mr @entity97 – whose full title is first secretary of state – will take charge of the day - to - day business of government in their absence until he goes away on his own foreign holiday next week			1
happy holidays : @entity8 and his wife @entity24 stop for a quick coffee as they start their summer break in @entity22 refreshment : @entity24 tells her husband a story while his sips on his coffee do n't forget to leave a tip ! last year in @entity58 the prime minister failed to leave any spare change and fell out with an angry member of staff action replay : the @entity132 last year in @entity31 having a coffee at the start of their hols , with the prime minister clearly wearing the blue shirt he uses when he goes casual on a break his wife might be an ambassador for the @entity140 , but even @entity142 ’s designer contact book ca n’t save husband @entity8 ’s holiday wardrobe			1
when you spend most of your time power dressing in a suit and tie dressing down in style can be tricky			0
yes , he is a dad on holiday but that does n’t mean he has to dress like man from @entity153 circa 1992			0
holiday dressing is a skill , and unfortunately for @entity8 taking off your tie and swapping a smart shirt for a ‘ relaxed ’ chambray style is not enough when vacationing in one of the world ’s most stylish countries			1
while @entity24 channels her typical chic holiday vibe in a simple denim tunic dress and box fresh @entity168 , @entity8 looks less than comfortable in the @entity36 heat wave in freshly pressed jeans , slip - on shoes and navy denim - look shirt			1
next time he ’s away from @entity174 would recommend some tailored city shorts , a crisp white shirt and an espadrille for summer style points			0
( @entity179 , deputy femail editor ) home secretary @entity180 , who flew back early from holiday last summer when the riots began , will then take the helm for a few days before mr @entity8 returns			0
controversially , it emerged yesterday that this two - week break is not mr @entity54 ’s first summer holiday this year			0
the deputy prime minister quietly slipped away during the @entity83 to spend one week at the villa his family owns in @entity190			1
he has now flown to the small town of @entity192 in @entity36			1
he is due to spend two weeks in the area where his wife @entity194 grew up and her family still live			1
they will be accompanied by their three children @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			0
@entity106 mp @entity202 has repeatedly asked both mr @entity8 and mr @entity54 in @entity203 who would take over if the prime minister were to be unable to lead , but has never received a definitive answer			2
last night he told the @entity207 the holiday plans were proof that mr @entity97 , not mr @entity54 , would actually take charge			1
speaking shortly before himself flying to the @entity211 for a holiday , mr @entity202 said : ‘ what it clearly shows is that the real deputy prime minister is @entity97 and the prime minister has no intention of leaving @entity54 in charge , which is exceptionally good news for the @entity81 people			1
‘ we can sleep safely in our beds and hope that he enjoys himself			0
flashback : @entity8 with @entity31 waitress @entity70 , who he went back to see the next day after paying with a 50 euro note but left no tip all in this together , almost : both @entity8 and @entity54 depart from the @entity81 for their annual holidays in @entity36 today , but the pair are off to different destinations taking it easy : @entity54 on holiday in @entity232 last year left in charge : the departure of @entity8 and @entity54 means the most senior minister remaining in the @entity81 will be foreign secretary @entity97 ‘ i have never got a straight answer about the true pecking order but if @entity54 was a real deputy prime minister there is no way he would go on holiday at the same time as mr @entity8			1
‘ the only reason they do n’t say that @entity244 is number two is because it would offend @entity54 and the @entity105			0
‘ there is a serious point here			0
the country needs to know who is going to be in charge if the prime minister is unable to lead			1
’ an irritated mr @entity8 defended his right to a break on sunday			0
‘ i am a great believer that politicians are human beings and they need to have holidays , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t call it annual leave , i call it a holiday and i am looking forward to having a holiday			0
’ no 10 officials insist that mr @entity8 remains in charge over his summer break			2
he will be accompanied by a fully working office , security official and secure communications on his trip to the @entity269			2
@entity41 said he would be returning to the @entity81 next week and would be ‘ back in the office for a couple of days ’			2
he will then head off for a ‘ short break ’ in @entity19 before returning to @entity273 in time for the start of the @entity275 on august 29			0
allies say mr @entity54 is in need of a break after a strained period in coalition relations following the abandonment of his plans for @entity284 reform			0
a source close to the @entity105 leader said : ‘ it ’s primarily so they can both get back for the @entity275			0
‘ last year there was a phase where @entity54 was minding the shop			0
‘ he agrees with the prime minister that politicians do need holidays and the time available has been limited by events this summer			1
’ he did take charge of the government for a few days last summer but mr @entity8 was forced to come home early from holiday as the conflict in @entity302 escalated			2
a senior @entity105 source added : ‘ perhaps @entity202 should relax and have a holiday himself			2
’ ‘ i ’m sure mrs @entity308 would appreciate the quality time , ’ the source added , in a reference to mr @entity202 ’s regular mentions of his wife ’s views when questioning members of the @entity313 in @entity203 .			0

the @entity132 and the @entity315 have jetted off for family holidays to different parts of @entity36
@entity97 will be left as most senior minister in charge , but the @entity292 says he is taking his office
