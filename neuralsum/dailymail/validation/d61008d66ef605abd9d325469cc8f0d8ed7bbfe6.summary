@entity2 keeps his @entity1 team on their toes , according to captain @entity0 @entity0 says @entity2 can flip tables over when @entity1 are winning but stay calm when they are losing ' sometimes you 're losing a game at half - time , which does n't happen often at this club , and you expect to come in and get a rollicking , ' @entity0 said			1
' but you come in and the manager is calm , collected , the complete opposite			0
he 's like , " listen , we 're going to win the game			2
we 're going to get an early goal " and he talks you through it			0
' while @entity2 's calmer side has been used to get his team through difficult periods , such as when they were drawing 2 - 2 with @entity40 at half - time on sunday after taking an early two - goal lead , he can also operate at the other end of the scale			2
@entity2 sometimes knocks tables over and sends water flying during his half - time speeches the @entity49 boss used his calmer side to help them through a difficult moment against @entity40 but @entity0 feels those little details from @entity2 's behaviour keep his team ready for anything , something that has helped them take the initiative in the title race all season while winning the @entity61 earlier this month			1
' other times you 'll be winning 2 - 0 or 3 - 0 and you 'll come in happy at half - time and he 'll go ballistic , ' @entity0 told @entity65			2
' tables will go over , bottles of water will go flying			0
you think " where 's that come from ? " ' but you go out for the second half and win the game 5 - 0 rather than scraping through 3 - 1 , 3 - 2			2
' he knows when players take their foot off the gas			0
he can sense something before the game			0
he just gets a feel for everyone and every single game			0
and i look at that and think no one else has got that that i â€™ve experienced			0
