@entity0 bemoaned the refereeing blunder which cost ten - man @entity3 side a crack at a rare domestic treble			1
@entity8 's sublime 16th free - kick gave the @entity10 side a dream start to their @entity13 semi-final clash with @entity14			1
but the @entity10 side were denied a clear penalty and the chance to go 2 - 0 ahead before half - time when additional assistant @entity18 failed to spot a goalline handball from @entity20			1
@entity0 was angry at the referee 's decision to now send off @entity20 and award his side a penalty @entity3 's anger was further fuelled when @entity26 - rightly - sent off @entity10 keeper @entity27 for clattering into @entity28 in 53 minutes , @entity30 equalising from the spot			1
a man down for 67 minutes the @entity34 champions wilted in extra-time , succumbing to goals from @entity37 and @entity38 , despite @entity39 making it 2 - 2			1
in measured tones , @entity0 chose his reaction to the penalty furore carefully saying : ' i do n't think i have to say much about that			1
' i think everybody can see what 's happening			1
the @entity14 defender ( 6 ) handled @entity50 goal - bound header but none of the officials saw it ' when they played with 11 v 11 we had good control of the game and produced good chances and enough to win the game			1
' but , of course , with ten it gets more difficult and we have to run more			0
' and , again , we got very tired			0
' pinning the blame for the incident on the unsighted additional assistant @entity18 rather than referee @entity64 the @entity65 added : ' we have five referees , maybe we need seven â€“ i do n't know			1
the @entity3 boss remonstrated with @entity26 at half - time and was angry at the poor decision ' he has one task			1
he has to look at something on the goalline			0
' you ca n't blame the main referee for that			2
' asked if it was a big , critical moment in the game he added : ' i do n't think			0
' the game is finished if we get it			0
' that 's a tough day			2
hard to take of course			0
@entity14 ' players celebrate at the final whistle after reaching the @entity13 final after extra time ' i think we fought very hard			1
when you do n't get the result you want of course it 's a blow for us			2
' the @entity20 incident , the latest in a wretched season for @entity34 referees , will reopen the debate surrounding television replays			1
' this will not help anything today , ' said @entity0 , dismissing the idea			1
' it 's very hard for me to discuss this			2
' it 's a big blow for the boys			2
' we had control , eleven v eleven and should have killed the game before			0
@entity8 ( left ) had given @entity3 the lead and put his side in control before all the incidents kicked off ' we did n't do it and put ourselves in very sad situation			1
' but @entity14 are a good football team			1
i also have to congratulate them			0
they have had a good season and if they get a title it will be even better , so that 's very good			2
' insisting he had no issues over the red card for @entity27 which forced him to remove the dangerous @entity126 and put @entity127 in goals @entity0 vowed to lift his shatteted players for wednesday 's trip to @entity131 on league business			1
currently leading @entity133 by five points with a game in hand he insisted : ' we have to move on			0
we still have a lot to fight for			0
@entity27 ( left ) was rightly sent off by the referee for fouling @entity28 when he went through ' the league title is still the most important thing			1
we have to get back on track			0
' good teams bounce back quickly			0
now on wednesday we have to be back on track , and that 's what we 're aiming for			2
' everybody is very disappointed today			0
but i have had disappointing moments before in football			0
it 's about how you handle it and what you learn from it			2
we 've done a lot of good things so far and if we win the league as well we 'll have had a good season			0
so we have a lot to build on			0
' we just have to move on			0
today i understand we can be a little bit disappointed , and the supporters of course , but we have to come together from tomorrow and really focus on wednesday			0
