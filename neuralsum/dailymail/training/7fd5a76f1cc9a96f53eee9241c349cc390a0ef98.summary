the next 30 minutes are going to be a challenge for @entity1			1
from the moment he walks into a meeting room at @entity6 ’s plush hotel , he knows where the conversation will head			1
as soon as he puts his phone and wash bag on the floor and settles into a chair , he knows it will be necessary to revisit the events of april 27			2
that , of course , was the day @entity6 ’s exhilarating surge to win a first league title since 1990 came asunder ; the day the fates conspired against him			1
thousands of dreams died as @entity30 won 2 - 0			1
with some players , reopening old wounds would be strictly off limits but @entity1 is different			1
he has never shied away from the difficult subjects and , even though this is particularly painful , he is not about to start now			2
so how was it after @entity30 ? ‘ you are a brave man asking this question , ’ comes the reply , his eyes narrowing			1
‘ how do you think it was ? you tell me			2
’ the worst day of your life ? ‘ there ’s your answer			1
’ body on the line : @entity1 moves to block a shot from @entity64 player @entity63 during @entity6 's @entity66 match in @entity67 still the main man : @entity1 salutes the crowd at @entity70 after @entity6 's 1 - 0 win over @entity64 on sunday video @entity6 everything to @entity73 once the issue is broached , @entity1 opens up			1
few people in football speak with such searing honesty and , in some ways , this is cathartic			1
it has been a demanding , draining period in his professional life but speaking about it now can bring closure			2
‘ it was cruel , ’ he says			2
‘ i have n’t lost my man at a set piece			2
i have n’t missed a penalty			0
i have n’t made a bad pass or a mistake			0
every single person on the planet slips at some point in their life , whether it is on a set of stairs , on the floor or whatever			2
‘ for me , it happened on the pitch at a really bad moment			2
but , you know , over the course of 38 games , a lot happens for you and against you and that determines whether you win the league or not			0
but that happened at a really crucial time and i have to face that			0
‘ @entity112 is n’t always going to be celebrations , highs and winning things and stuff like that			0
when you ’re fighting for things at this level there are always going to be heartbreaks and disappointments and the last three months have been a massive disappointment , probably the worst of my life			1
‘ when you ’re captain of this team , you ca n’t afford to feel sorry for yourself or mope around			0
everyone in this group looks to me to see what sort of mood i ’m in ; to see how i am behaving round the place moving forward so i have to shake it off pretty quick			0
‘ and i will do			0
but i have to use it as a positive to drive me on			0
at 34 there is no possible way i am going to let the last three months be the things i remember moving forward			0
it ’s important it finishes on a high			0
’ we go again : @entity6 's preparations for the forthcoming season are well underway , with @entity140 ( second left ) congratulated after scoring the winner against @entity64 close bond : @entity1 will be deployed as a ' quarterback ' by manager @entity144 this season as that moment was so dramatic , it has obscured how much @entity1 actually did to get @entity6 in a position to challenge @entity33			1
his performances after he returned from a hamstring injury in january were exemplary , arguably as good as at any point during his stellar career			0
he contributed 13 of @entity6 ’s 101 @entity24 goals , created another 15 and thrived in the deep - lying role @entity144 created for him			1
@entity73 has been raving on this tour of @entity155 how @entity1 will be his ‘ quarterback ’ and advancing years are no barrier to his importance			1
there is , clearly , a bond between the captain and his manager and @entity73 was responsible for providing the crucial advice when he came to make a decision about his @entity27 career			1
though he still feels he could influence @entity166 ’s team , ending his 114 - cap career after the @entity26 felt right			1
he and @entity6 will now reap the benefits and it will also allow him to spend time with his girls — wife @entity172 and their three daughters : @entity176 - @entity175 , @entity177 and @entity178			1
@entity179 : @entity1 decided to retire from international football after winning 114 caps for @entity27 over the space of 14 years repeat performance ? @entity6 will hope to once again challenge for the title as they did last season			1
here , @entity186 is pictured celebrating his goal in the 3 - 2 win over @entity33 at @entity31 ‘ you sort of feel like you are lying to them all the time , ’ @entity1 explains			1
‘ it ’s difficult to say to them you are going away for four to six weeks			0
so you kind of lie and say you will only be gone a couple of weeks , then they are on the phone and on @entity196 saying they want you home			0
‘ it does become difficult being away			0
i ’ve done it for 14 years			0
i had to be fair to my family but also to @entity6 as well			1
to be fair to @entity144 , when i had the chat with him , he said that if you want to carry on for @entity27 i can tailor your @entity6 games			1
‘ when i had the chat with him i was close to already knowing what i was going to do			0
when he said that my @entity6 games could be tailored then it made me go to 100 per cent with my decision because i do n’t want my @entity6 games to be tailored			1
‘ i still want to be available , i want to be fresh and play at a high level for @entity6 for certainly one more season			1
we will have to wait and see if there are any more after that			0
i do n’t feel like a weight has been lifted because i never saw it as a burden			0
@entity220 recruits : @entity6 moved quickly to sign @entity222 's @entity221 for £ 25m prior to the @entity26 injury blow : @entity224 arrived from @entity225 for a £ 10m fee but suffered an injury in the pre-season friendly at @entity229 reinforcements : @entity231 has also been brought in from @entity232 for £ 20m sign here please : @entity234 became the third player to join from @entity222 for £ 20m ‘ i used to love going down there , knowing i was going to be captain			1
of course i ’m going to feel fresher and benefit from not playing			0
‘ i do n’t feel as if i could go to a tournament at 36 and be who i wanted to be			2
everything was pointing towards calling it a day but i ’m going to miss it			2
’ he will not , however , be dwelling on it as there are big challenges ahead and the words from another emotional moment in april will be in his mind			2
after @entity6 had beaten @entity33 , who they face tonight in a friendly here , @entity1 gathered his squad together			1
‘ we go again , exactly the same , ’ he implored , demanding that focus be retained			0
he will say the same over the coming weeks as he starts to dream about finally getting his hands on the trophy he has coveted all his life			2
his faith in a squad that has lost @entity259 is unshakeable			0
incoming : @entity260 , the @entity261 striker , is the latest to join the @entity31 club but will be loaned back to his former club @entity263 next season gone : @entity6 will have to cope without their talisman @entity259 , who scored 31 goals last season , after the striker moved to @entity268 enduring popularity : @entity1 poses for selfies with @entity6 fans as they train at @entity272 in @entity273 ahead of their next pre-season tour match against @entity33 pukker up : @entity1 is asked for a kiss by a @entity6 fan in @entity272 as the @entity277 continue their @entity155 tour ‘ that was real , it was from my heart , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i was emotional at the time as we had just beaten @entity33			1
it was a reminder to everyone that there was still work to do and as it proved there was			2
but i ’ll keep going and i will go again			0
‘ we are a good team with a good manager , that is getting stronger			0
the confidence is rising in the dressing room and we have got to show that we are the real deal			0
we are not there to just make up the numbers			0

@entity1 describes ' cruel ' slip that allowed @entity29 to score for @entity30 at @entity31 as ' worst day of his life '
