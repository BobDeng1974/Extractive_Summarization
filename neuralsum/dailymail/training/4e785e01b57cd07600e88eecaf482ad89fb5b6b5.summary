by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:10 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 14:56 est , 3 june 2013 the @entity2 has ruled that police can collect dna from anyone they arrest , equating a dna cheek swab to common jailhouse procedures like take fingerprints and mug shots			2
civil liberties groups condemned monday 's decision - saying it amounts to creating a ' gaping new exception to the @entity13 ' by allowing authorities to collect a person 's dna and add it to national criminal databases without a warrant - no matter whether they are convicted or not			2
the split 5 - 4 decision saw conservative justice @entity20 join three liberal colleagues , justices @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity25 , in opposing the ruling			1
collected : the @entity2 ruling paves the way for allowing states to collect dna evidence from anyone arrested by police should police be allowed to keep dna collected from anyone they arrest on national database â€“ even if they are not convicted of a crime ? ' make no mistake about it : because of today 's decision , your dna can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested , rightly or wrongly , and for whatever reason , ' @entity20 said in a sharp dissent , which he read aloud in the courtroom			1
' this will solve some extra crimes , to be sure			0
but so would taking your dna when you fly on an airplane - surely the @entity52 must know the ' identity ' of the flying public			0
for that matter , so would taking your children 's dna when they start public school			2
' the five justices who ruled in favor of allowing routine dna collection said it was similar to practices already allowed under the @entity13 - which protects against unreasonable searches and seizure of property			0
' taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee @entity56 is , like fingerprinting and photographing , a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the @entity13 , ' justice @entity68 wrote for the court 's five - justice majority			1
according to court documents , the @entity76 's @entity75 or @entity75 - a coordinated system of federal , state and local databases of dna profiles - already contains more than 10 million criminal profiles and 1.1 million profiles of those arrested			1
anger : justice @entity20 issued a sharp dissent to the court 's majority opinion - claiming that the benefits of @entity56 collection for arrestees do not outweigh to violations of privacy according to the @entity76 , dna from people who have gotten the charge dismissed , who were acquitted or from whom no charges were brought are supposed to be expunged from the federal system			1
but states and other municipalities that collect dna make their own rules about what happens to their collection			0
the case centers around @entity106 , who was arrested in 2009 in @entity107 , @entity108 , on assault charges			1
when he was booked into jail - before his trial - deputies took a dna sample with a cheek swab			0
' make no mistake about it : because of today 's decision , your dna can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested , rightly or wrongly , and for whatever reason			1
' justice @entity20 , dissenting from the majority ruling the dna matched evidence from a brutal 2003 rape and robbery of a 53 - year - old woman			1
that evidence was then used to convict him of the six - year - old crime			0
he was sentenced to life in prison			0
twenty - eight states and the federal government now take dna swabs after arrests			2
but a @entity108 court was one of the first to say that it was illegal for that state to take @entity140 's dna without approval from a judge , saying @entity140 had ' a sufficiently weighty and reasonable expectation of privacy against warrantless , suspicionless searches ' under the @entity13			1
but the high court 's decision reverses that ruling and reinstates @entity140 's rape conviction , which was overturned by the @entity108 court			1
@entity68 wrote the decision , and was joined by chief justice @entity152 and justices @entity153 , @entity155 and @entity156			1
the @entity157 represented @entity140 at trial and condemned the court 's decision			2
' the @entity13 has long been understood to mean that the police can not search for evidence of a crime - and all nine justices agreed that dna testing is a search - without individualized suspicion , ' said @entity166 , the group 's legal director			1
' today 's decision eliminates that crucial safeguard			0
at the same time , it 's important to recognize that other state laws on dna testing are even broader than @entity108 's and may present issues that were not resolved by today 's ruling			1
' rapist : the @entity2 decision today upheld the conviction of @entity140 , who was convicted of a six - year - old violent rape after @entity56 was collected from him at his arrest on unrelated charges @entity108 's dna collection law only allows police to take dna from those arrested for serious crimes like murder , rape , assault , burglary and other crimes of violence			1
in his ruling , @entity68 did not say whether the court 's decision limits dna only to those crimes , but he did note that other states ' dna collection laws differ from @entity108 's			1
@entity20 saw that as a flaw			0
' if you believe that a @entity56 search will identify someone arrested for bank robbery , you must believe that it will identify someone arrested for running a red light , ' he said			0
the ruling was praised by the @entity207			0
' @entity56 has already aided nearly 200,000 investigations , and thanks to today 's decision it will continue to be a detective 's most valuable tool in solving rape cases , ' said @entity214 , the group 's president and founder			0
' we 're very pleased that the court recognized the importance of dna and decided that , like fingerprints , it can be collected from arrestees without violating any privacy rights			2
' out of every 100 rapes in this country , only three rapists will spend a day behind bars			0
to make matters worse , rapists tend to be serial criminals , so every one left on the streets is likely to commit still more attacks			0
@entity56 is a tool we could not afford to lose			0
' getting dna swabs from criminals is common			2
all 50 states and the federal government take cheek swabs from convicted criminals to check against federal and state databanks , with the court 's blessing			2
the fight at the @entity2 was over whether that dna collection could come before conviction and without a judge issuing a warrant .			0

justice @entity20 joined liberal colleagues , justices @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity25 , in opposing the ruling
@entity76 keeps dna database of *1.1million* arrestees and *10milion* crimes
justice @entity68 likened taking dna swabs to jailers taking fingerprints and booking photos
case centers on @entity108 felon @entity140 , who was convicted of violent *sex* crime after he was arrested for unrelated assault
dna taken at @entity140 's jail booking matched evidence from 2003 rape
