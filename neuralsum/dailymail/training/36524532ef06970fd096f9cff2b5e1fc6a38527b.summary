tragic : @entity2 the chihuahua - pug mix was eaten alive on monday in front of his terrified and shocked owner in @entity8 , @entity9 friends : @entity2 and @entity24 , his pug friend at home with @entity7 - who lost her beloved pet on monday ' i had not seen a bear yet , ' @entity7 said wednesday to the @entity30			1
' i had no idea it would be 5 feet from my house , eating my dog			0
' the shocking run - in occurred on monday evening at 6pm when @entity7 returned home and opened the doors to let @entity2 , who weighs six - pounds and her other pug named @entity24 outside as she took her groceries inside			1
she then heard @entity24 ' scream ' and rushed onto her decking to see @entity2 pinned under a brown bear 's paw just five - feet away			1
the bear , which is estimated to be three or four - years old , ' had just put his huge paw on the little dog and ripped him to pieces			2
' ' i screamed and screamed at the bear , ' said @entity7 , who rushed inside to get a gun , but could n't find it as her mind went blank from the horror of the situation			1
instead she called state troopers and waited for them to arrive as the bear sat in front of her home eating @entity58 for 10 minutes			1
recent move : @entity7 is a healthcare professional and recently moved from @entity61 to @entity9 - and prior to monday told friends she was looking forward to seeing her first bear ' that bear had no fear of me whatsoever			1
he never even acknowledged my presence , ' @entity7 said			0
' it was horrifying , ' @entity7 said			0
' the worst part was how helpless i felt			0
' troopers arrived and scared the bear away and later found the remains of @entity58			0
@entity7 told the @entity30 that she thinks her dog thought the bear was a large dog			2
this was because he had never set eyes one before because she brought him with her from @entity61 in january			2
she thinks that @entity2 approached the bear and lay down to submit to it			2
before : @entity58 ( left ) and @entity24 watch the front of @entity7 ' home - where the attack took place and play on the floor at home ' i really think the whole thing was just accidental , ' she said			1
' but once a bear has found a food source , he comes back			0
' that evening the bear returned and @entity7 and her partner @entity94 fired shots from a pistol in its direction to scare it off			1
they called troopers back and then called out representatives from the @entity102			0
@entity7 denies that she and her partner have been naive in their attitudes towards living in @entity9			1
she told the @entity30 that she knows @entity8 , an island community with 9,000 people , is prone to bears			2
however , the incident shook her so much that she contemplated leaving the state altogether but she says now she has decided to stay , fight and ' put her war paint on			2
' she has bought a shotgun and is ready to ' never , ever let that happen again			0
' fearsome : the bear ( not pictured ) that ate @entity58 has not been found yet , but @entity7 has purchased a shotgun should it return however , since her harrowing account was published on wednesday , @entity7 has been responding vigorously to criticism she has received online			1
thanking the large majority of well - wishers , upset for her loss , @entity7 has choice words for the ' hard asses ' small : the little @entity123 only weighed six - pounds and may have thought the bear was another larger dog to play with ' i knew there were bears here when i chose to live here			1
just because it 's @entity9 does n't mean that me and my tiny dog do not have the right to feel safe in our own home , ' said @entity7 on @entity133 to commenter 's online			1
' a close encounter with a bear is much like labor , no matter how much you read or how many women describe it to you it does not become real until you have experienced it			0
' venting her fury at another commenter , @entity7 said that she is prepared to fight for her property against the encroaching bear and is not afraid to use lethal force			2
' i will burn the entire forest on my 2 acres if that 's what it takes to live here safely , ' said @entity7			0
' i did not disturb this bear , he is a rogue and came into my yard and killed my dog within 5 feet of my porch in broad daylight			0
' if he returns to my house again i have already made the decision and preparation to blow his f * * * * * * head off			0
' currently the bear has not been located , although @entity166 are waiting to see what the bear will do			0
they have said their options are to use a stun gun to scare it off or to drug it and transport it elsewhere on the island .			0
