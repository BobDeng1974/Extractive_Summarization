' the failure to detect a fracture on an x-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in @entity4 , ' says @entity5 , an orthopaedic trauma surgeon @entity6 had mixed feelings when the @entity4 doctor said the x-ray of her elbow showed no sign of a fracture			1
‘ it was a relief there was no serious damage			2
but i was in agony — i could n’t move or straighten my arm , and felt i needed more than just paracetamol and a few days off work , ’ recalls @entity6 , 60 , a chef from @entity13 in @entity14			1
the pain had begun suddenly when she stretched up to adjust a showerhead			2
‘ at first i thought i ’d slept on my arm badly , ’ she says			2
‘ but it was so painful , my partner advised me to get it checked			2
’ six days after she was seen at @entity4 , @entity6 received a phone call from the hospital			1
doctors had reviewed the x-ray and there was a fracture after all , in the olecranon , the protruding bone that forms the tip of the elbow			1
it was a mistake that , four years on , is still affecting @entity6 ’s life			1
for a second x-ray showed that the fractured bone fragments had moved 4mm in the intervening days			2
her arm was put in a cast , then a week later she had surgery to pin the bone in place			2
but a year after the operation she developed a painful infection because fluid had built up around the fracture			1
and three years later she still gets pain in the joint , especially in cold weather			2
‘ i had to have so much time off work , i was demoted and put on a lower wage , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’ve never got back on track			0
’ @entity6 has never had a proper explanation for the delay in spotting the fracture			1
‘ one doctor told me , “ i ’m afraid sometimes these things get missed ” , ’ she says			1
every year one person in 100 in the @entity63 breaks a bone , and about half the 20 million or so visits to @entity4 involve having an x-ray , mostly to check for bone injury			0
but research suggests that thousands of patients walk out of @entity4 with doctors having failed to spot their fracture			1
‘ numerous studies have shown that failure to detect a fracture on an x-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in @entity4 , ’ says @entity5 , consultant orthopaedic trauma surgeon at @entity71			1
and if a broken bone is not stabilised quickly , the impact can be devastating			0
‘ at the very least , people suffer prolonged pain and inconvenience , ’ says mr @entity5 , ‘ but it can also lead to ‘ chronic functional limitation with long - term pain , early symptoms of osteoarthritis or a stiff joint			0
’ the bone may also fail to fuse and need complex surgery later			0
so why does it happen ? ordering the correct x-ray , then detecting an abnormality on the image takes skill and experience			0
yet @entity4 patients are most likely to be seen by junior doctors , with new doctors ‘ fresh from medical school being the most senior staff working at evenings and weekends in one in five @entity4 departments ’ , according to a study by the @entity103			0
‘ you can identify a major fracture of a large long bone across the room , ’ says mr @entity5			1
‘ but more subtle injuries require a systematic approach that comes with experience			0
’ about half the 20 million or so visits to @entity4 involve having an x-ray , mostly to check for bone injury a study published in the @entity115 in 2002 showed that junior doctors in @entity4 miss up to 39 per cent of ‘ clinically significant abnormalities ’ on x-rays			1
this is why many , but not all , hospitals have introduced a safety net : all x-rays should be reviewed by a specialist — either a radiologist ( a clinician specialising in interpreting scan images ) or a specially trained radiographer , whose main job is taking x-rays			1
this can make a big difference			0
a study at @entity132 found that people whose fractures were reviewed only by an @entity4 doctor were ten times more likely to be wrongly given the all - clear			1
and patients whose x-rays were checked by a specialist before they left @entity4 were three times less likely to have a missed fracture , according to a 2013 study by the @entity143			1
however , there is currently no time - based target for specialist reviews , which can be postponed for weeks			1
a recent audit of missed fractures and abnormalities at one @entity151 hospital revealed that , at worst , it took 48 days before x-rays were reviewed			1
meanwhile , a survey of a quarter of @entity156 radiology departments last year revealed it had taken more than 30 days before over 80,000 x-rays were reviewed by a radiologist			1
‘ this suggests that nationally about 300,000 patients are waiting more than a month for their x-rays to be analysed , ’ says dr @entity159 , president of the @entity160			1
this means the @entity156 also picks up a substantial bill for surgery and other treatments that would have been avoided if fractures were detected earlier			0
yet observers have noted an increase in missed fractures			2
@entity172 , a clinical negligence solicitor at @entity174 , says the firm has seen a rise in cases of patients misdiagnosed with sprains and soft - tissue injuries , only to be later diagnosed with fractures that could be clearly seen in the first radiology images			0
‘ as a result , the patients have had a delay in treatment , often resulting in the fractures becoming worse , ’ she says			0
certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed in x-rays certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed			1
‘ hairline fractures , where the bone is broken but not misaligned , appear as a fine line on an x-ray which can be overlooked , ’ says dr @entity192 , emergency medicine consultant at @entity193 , in @entity194			0
‘ or the bone may be hidden — this commonly happens with fractures to the scaphoid bone , one of the smallest in the wrist and the one most likely to break			0
’ guidelines issued by the @entity103 recommend that patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture and tenderness in the wrist area should be offered a @entity211 ( @entity211 ) scan even if the x-ray comes back clear			2
this year , the @entity213 is due to issue wider guidelines on the diagnosis of fractures in emergency departments			0
like @entity6 , @entity218 suffered after a fracture was missed in @entity4			1
the former nurse , now 57 , broke her wrist after tripping on the steps of her @entity151 home in august 2013			0
at @entity4 she was told that the x-ray showed a broken bone in her right wrist , and her arm was put in a cast			0
‘ i went home expecting it to gradually get better but it did n’t , ’ she says			0
‘ i was in such agony i could n’t even brush my hair			0
’ two months later , when the cast was removed , a further x-ray showed a second fracture — she had also broken the ulna bone ( which enables the wrist to rotate ) , but it had been missed			1
she needed specialist surgery and she was put on a waiting list for several months			2
while she was still recovering , @entity241 lost her job			0
people who walk out of surgery with an undiagnosed fracture may not seem obvious victims , but their lives can still be blighted , says @entity248 , chief executive of the @entity249			2
‘ we should be working towards a system where every patient has his or her x-ray reviewed before being discharged from @entity4			2
the evidence shows how powerful this would be			0
‘ if a medication had the kind of impact this simple change in procedure has , every hospital in the country would have to provide it			0

for @entity6 , a fracture of her elbow that was missed is still affecting her life
some hospitals have introduced a safety net in which all x-rays are reviewed by a specialist
