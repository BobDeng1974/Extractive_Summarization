their work found that prescription painkillers , known as opioids , were causing a ' substantial ' strain on the country 's hospitals , the @entity30 reports			1
they concluded : ' further efforts to stem the prescription opioid overdose epidemic are urgently needed			1
' opioid drugs - which include forms of morphine , methadone , oxycodone and hydrocodone , such as @entity45 and @entity46 - are prescribed for patients in need of powerful painkillers			2
but if people take them over an extended period of time , they will often develop a tolerance to the drugs and require a higher dose to feel any affect			0

danger : the danger of opioids - such as oxycontin - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly addictive , say experts he is encouraging police departments to provide officers with naloxone - a fast - working antidote that can reverse overdoses and prevent death			2

' in 2012 , a @entity128 study showed that physicians play a worrying role - their prescriptions contributing to nearly half of all overdose deaths			2
in response to the epidemic , almost every state has now created a prescription drug monitoring program - so physicians can log into a computer to check whether a patient is getting a dangerous narcotic from another doctor			1

' the number of deaths resulting from prescription painkiller overdose also continues to rise , especially among women			1
' the @entity176 - who published the report - describe the effect such prescription drugs have on the human body			2
it 's authors write : ' at the heart of opioid addiction is the powerful rewarding effect [ that triggers ] a cascade of intense pleasurable responses related to the brain dopamine release			0
' users describe an initial rush followed by feelings of warmth , pleasure and sedation			0
' once regular use is established , vulnerable individuals develop an uncontrollable compulsive behaviour that is the main characteristic of opioid dependence , seeking to obtain the substance in spite of any negative consequence			0
