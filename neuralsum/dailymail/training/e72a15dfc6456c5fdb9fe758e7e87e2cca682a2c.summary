being the @entity1 ’s most expensive player can feel like a curse - just ask @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			1
but for @entity7 ’s record £ 60million buy @entity8 , signed from @entity9 in the summer , there have been few teething problems so far in adjusting to life at @entity13 - apart from the language			1
despite already scoring wonderful goals against @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity19 ’s stick - thin frame has led to concerns he wo n’t be able to deal with the rough stuff @entity1 defenders occasionally dish out to skilled opponents			1
@entity8 has made an electric start to his @entity7 career following his summer move the @entity28 international ( centre ) joined in a £ 60million deal from @entity9 the 5ft 11in @entity30 was listed on the @entity9 website as weighing 11st and his former team - mate @entity33 , who made the journey from the @entity36 to @entity37 12 months earlier , struggled with the physicality of @entity40 football during his first season			1
ahead of sunday ’s midday showdown with @entity45 , in which he will be regarded as @entity7 ’s main threat particularly following @entity48 ’s suspension , @entity8 has assured the club ’s fans he wo n’t be cowed by the combative nature of @entity40 football			1
‘ i have already noticed it is a more physical , aggressive style of football here than in @entity56 , ’ said @entity19 , who averaged only 1.3 tackles per game in @entity54			2
@entity33 ( top ) has struggled with the physicality of @entity40 football since his move from @entity9 ‘ players here are more powerful and show their strength a lot more			1
it ’s all about settling in as quickly as possible in another league so i ’ve just got to do that and make things work			0
‘ i think there have been other players of a similar build and stature to me - slim if you like			2
they have come to @entity73 and shown a physical resilience and i hope to do the same as well			2
‘ the main thing is i ’m really , really happy			0
it ’s a league i ’ve always wanted to play in and i ’m overjoyed now i ’ve come here			0
’ @entity77 ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) are two of the @entity1 's most dangerous attacking players @entity19 will take encouragement from the success that lightweights like @entity78 and @entity77 have enjoyed in @entity73			1
a free - kick belted past @entity16 goalkeeper @entity84 on his @entity7 home debut has helped , too			1
‘ i ’m very happy with the start i ’ve made , ’ added the 26 - year - old			1
‘ it ’s not easy settling into a new type of football when you go somewhere for the first time but i ’ve settled in quickly with my team - mates and the club			0
‘ i believe there are special players here			0
even when i was starting out in @entity28 , i was aware of names like @entity99 and @entity48			0
now i have a chance to line up with them and i am pleased with how our understanding has started off			0
it is about converting that understanding into chances and goals			0
i ’ve got used to the style of play and my team - mates but what has got to come now with that is a series of good results			0
’ @entity19 scored on his home debut for @entity7 in their 4 - 0 thrashing vs @entity16 in the @entity1 last month united fans will agree with that last sentiment			1
despite the goal - scoring threat posed by @entity8 , @entity48 , @entity99 , @entity118 and @entity119 , the team have been a defensive shambles , shipping five goals at @entity17 and four at @entity123 @entity124 in the @entity125			2
and manager @entity126 has already made it clear to his attacking superstars that he expects them to help contribute to the defensive organisation			0
there is no doubt that @entity7 fans should see the peak of @entity19			1
at 26 , he has enjoyed a spectacular last 12 months , regarded as the man of the match when @entity9 won their 10th @entity135 in may and then starring for @entity28 in the @entity136			2
the 26 - year - old was denied the opportunity to star for his country in the @entity136 final due to a thigh injury many back home believe if @entity19 had n’t suffered a thigh strain that forced him to miss the final against @entity144 , @entity28 would be world champions			1
his biggest challenge may be learning fluent @entity40			0
@entity147 has ordered a host of his @entity150 - speaking stars - including @entity151 and @entity152 who have played here for a while - to take twice - weekly language lessons			0
@entity19 acknowledges he is doing his best but also lets slip a trade secret , that @entity147 does use the @entity150 he acquired from his time at @entity157 to aid communication			0
the record signing admits : ‘ learning @entity40 is not easy			2
i have a teacher and started taking classes , trying to speak a bit of @entity40 with him			1
@entity7 boss @entity126 ( left ) has ordered @entity19 ( right ) to take @entity40 lessons twice - a - week ‘ it ’s going quite well but it ’s not going to happen overnight , its going to take time			1
but it ’s something i have to do to settle in as quickly as possible			0
‘ it really helps that the manager speaks @entity150 and one or two of the backroom staff speak good @entity150 too			0
‘ there are @entity150 - speaking players as well and it means between all of them , messages get across and at least i have someone to speak to as well ! ’ like our @entity7 facebook page .			2

@entity8 wants to be a @entity1 hit despite his slim frame
@entity19 has been an early *relevation* since joining @entity7 in a club record £ 60million deal from @entity9 this summer
@entity78 and @entity77 have *flourished* in @entity73 's top *flight* despite their slight physiques
@entity19 *revealed* he is happy with his start at @entity7
26 - year - old is taking @entity40 classes twice - a - week to help him settle in
