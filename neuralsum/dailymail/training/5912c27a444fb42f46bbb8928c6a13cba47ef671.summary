' will we ever prove it ? no — how can you ? ' it ’s a completely circumstantial case with the only real science that we can count on after all these years being the forensic analysis , which is really hard to feel is coincidental when you keep seeing water marks on paper that @entity2 and @entity1 had in common			1
' the author acknowledged that even if the artist wrote some of the letters , it does not mean @entity1 was the killer			1
however , she added : ' in court , a jury might struggle with that			0
