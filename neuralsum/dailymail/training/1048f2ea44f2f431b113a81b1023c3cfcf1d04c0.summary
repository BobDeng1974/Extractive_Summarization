forty thousand tickets have been given to @entity10 members and sponsors , among other groups			0
and that means supporters find themselves at the mercy of inflated pricing			0
@entity4 chief executive @entity34 was less than impressed at the number of tickets available for fans - although that is n't a policy that 's recently been changed			2
' we are disappointed many of our supporters and also those of @entity11 will be unable to get tickets to the cup final , ' he said			1
' the balance in the @entity47 's allocation is n't right			0
there will be many disappointed fans - who have supported the club home and away for years - who will be unable to get a ticket to this historic match			0
' travelling away : @entity4 are always well supported away from the @entity54 but many will miss out this is the end : @entity57 is set to play what could be in line to play his final ever game for the @entity8			2
