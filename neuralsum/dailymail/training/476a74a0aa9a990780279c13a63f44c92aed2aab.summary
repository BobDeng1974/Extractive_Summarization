the @entity0 repeatedly declined on tuesday to offer legal justification for president @entity3 's forthcoming executive order calling off deportations for certain classes of illegal immigrants			1
repeating a statement from the president over the weekend , @entity0 press secretary @entity7 told reporters today that the executive branch would offer an explanation for its actions after @entity3 had made his announcement @entity3 himself had suggested multiple times that he could not go around @entity17 to freeze deportations because the president is not a ' king '' or an ' emperor ' - remarks his spokesman was reminded of today by @entity23 ' @entity22			1
the @entity3 administration official would n't say if @entity3 stood by that statement yet indicated in his response that since the president said that , the @entity29 had reviewed the law and come to the conclusion that there are unilateral actions the president can take			1
according to reports , @entity3 's executive order , which could come as early as friday , will cover roughly 5 million illegal immigrants who were either brought to the @entity52 as children or have young children living in the @entity52 the anticipated measures are seemingly outside the legal boundaries that president @entity3 , who is a constitutional lawyer by trade , set for himself in remarks on multiple occasions in the past			1
during a february 2013 @entity63 an immigration activist asked him what authority he had to keep families from being ' broken apart ' until @entity17 passed immigration reforms			0
@entity3 told him : ' this is something that i have struggled with throughout my presidency			2
the problem is , is that i ’m the president of the @entity52 , i ’m not the emperor of the @entity52			0
my job is to execute laws that are passed			0
' in 2010 he explained at a @entity77 town hall , ' i am president , i am not king , ' and therefore he could not personally issue a stay of deportation for 8 million immigrants who would be eligible to stay in the @entity52 if comprehensive immigration reforms were enacted by @entity17			1
' i ca n’t do these things just by myself , ' he said to the chagrin of immigration activists			1
in september of last year , @entity3 told then - @entity77 host @entity86 that he could n't expand his @entity87 to the parents of illegal immigrants because that would fall into a gray area legally			2
' if we start broadening that , then essentially i ’ll be ignoring the law in a way that i think would be very difficult to defend legally , ' @entity3 said			2
' so that ’s not an option			0
' but that 's exactly what the president is gearing up to do now , sources familiar with a 10 - point plan @entity3 is considering told @entity100 last week			1
he may also enlarge @entity87 to include illegal immigrants of any age who were under 16 when they were brought to the @entity52 currently the executive order requires them to have lived in the @entity52 since june 2007 and be under be under the age of 31			0
the aggrandized rule would allegedly bump the cut - off date up to january 2010			0
president @entity3 is pictured here during a meeting with his national security and public health teams today at the @entity0			1
seated to @entity3 's far left is @entity114 , secretary of homeland security , one of @entity3 's top immigration advisers			1
the @entity0 said today that a review conducted by @entity114 and attorney general @entity118 found that @entity3 has the authority to make some changes to the immigration system @entity7 today refused to comment on the rumors and suggested that the president may not have even received @entity125 ' recommendations for action yet			1
the president was so busy during his trip to @entity129 last week , @entity7 said , that he did n't really have time to think about immigration reform			0
grilled by @entity22 about what had changed since @entity3 asserted that the did n't have the authority to shield additional groups of illegal immigrants from mandatory removal proceedings , @entity7 said that not only had the attorney general and secretary of homeland security assured the president of his authority , the political climate had shifted			2
at the time @entity3 made those claims , comprehensive immigration reform was still being debated by @entity17 , @entity7 explained			2
the @entity144 passed that legislation in 2013 but the @entity0 did not , he noted , and now there 's little to no chance that @entity148 in the lower chamber will take up immigration legislation in the near future , creating an opening for @entity3 to issue his own measures			2
confronted with the argument that @entity148 leadership in the @entity0 was refusing to allow a vote on the president 's preferred immigration reform legislation long before @entity3 's comments last fall , @entity7 again pointed to the recent of the law by administration officials whose departments handle immigration			1
the dodge came after the president himself refused over the weekend to share the legal rationale for his actions			2
@entity3 was asked about the perceived flip - flop during a press conference in @entity172 , @entity173 on sunday			1
the president claimed at that time that his ' position has n’t changed ' since his 2010 remarks			2
' when i was talking to the advocates , their interest was in me , through executive action , duplicating the legislation that was stalled in @entity17 , ' he stated , referencing the @entity77 town hall			0
' and getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the @entity144 legislation , for example , does extend beyond my legal authorities			0
there are certain things i can not do			0
there are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws			0
' @entity3 said the @entity0 had been working with the @entity199 to determine what he could in fact do and has been advised that it is within his administration 's authority to take such actions such as ' reallocating resources and reprioritizing since we ca n’t do everything			1
' ' and it ’s on that basis that i ’ll be making a decision about any executive actions that i might take , ' @entity3 stated , before claiming as he has many times before that this entire debate would cease if @entity17 would ' pass a bill i can sign on this issue			1
' that law would should include a solution that ' solves our border problems , improves our legal immigration system , and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here working in our kitchens , working in farms , making beds in hotels			0
' everybody knows they ’re there , we ’re not going to deport all of them , ' he pointed out			0
' we ’d like to see them being able , out in the open , to pay their taxes , pay a penalty , get right with the law			0
' give me a bill that addresses those issues -- i ’ll be the first one to sign it and , metaphorically , i ’ll crumple up whatever executive actions that we take and we ’ll toss them in the wastebasket , because we will now have a law that addresses these issues			0
' in reviewing @entity3 's previous remarks , the @entity249 's fact - checking division ruled that the president had in fact changed his position on executive authority to act on immigration over the years , despite claiming that he had n't			1
the misleading statement earned him a mild slap on the wrist and one of the publication 's upside down @entity262 .			0

@entity3 's spokesman told reporters today the executive branch would offer an explanation after @entity3 's formal announcement
he noted that since @entity3 's previous statements his legal advisers had indicated that there are some actions he can take unilaterally
the president also changed his *calculus* because @entity277 refused to pass comprehensive reforms , he said
at a press conference on sunday @entity3 said he is able to reallocate resources and reprioritize deportation ' since we ca n’t do everything '
