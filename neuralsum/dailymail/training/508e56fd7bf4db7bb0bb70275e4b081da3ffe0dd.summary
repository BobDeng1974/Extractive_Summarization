by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 have been tucking into @entity5 's bowling all the way through this one - day international series and they were pictured gorging on fast food during practice			1
@entity11 and his team - mates seemed confident enough ahead of the final odi to fill their faces with @entity15 's and @entity16 's on the @entity18 outfield			1
the pictures seems like a throwback to the days before dieticians and nutritionists were commonplace in top - class sport and it is rare to see elite stars shovelling down burgers and fries			0
tucking in : @entity3 's marquee batsman @entity11 scoffs down some fast food on the @entity18 outfield during a nets session running on empty : @entity11 looks into his @entity16 's bag to see whether there is any more food left burger kings : @entity34 tucks into some fries ( left ) , while ( right ) @entity37 hero @entity36 is happy with a @entity38 however , @entity3 's ability to score quick runs on this tour has earned them the right to eat a bit of fast food before a dead rubber			1
their nutritional habits seem a long way from @entity5 's approach ahead of the @entity51 , when they were ridiculed for their 82 - page menu , including such delicacies as quinoa			2
@entity5 have barely given the tourists any food for thought in the previous three matches and were hammered at @entity37 on tuesday , losing by nine wickets with 19 - and - a - half overs to go			1
@entity62 thinks the hosts can learn a lot from @entity3 - but he did not mean in their refuelling habits			2
he said : ' me sitting on the sidelines for the first two games , watching the way @entity71 bat , you can learn a lot from the way they approach it , with no fear and just back themselves			0
' if there is a risk , they just take it			0
sometimes it does n't come off but as a team if we can all do that and execute the plan like i say then we will be fine			0
' in the seconds : @entity11 gestures to the dressing room while patting his stomach - perhaps he was asking for more ?			0
