by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 07:41 est , 6 january 2014 is sir @entity1 a distraction to @entity3 at @entity4 ? @entity4 have been going steadily off the rails since @entity3 took over , but defeat to @entity7 on sunday has turned their season into a train wreck			1
it was only the second time since 1984 they have been dumped out in the @entity13 third round – it only happened once under sir @entity1 – and the records keep tumbling for @entity3 like the @entity16 empire crumbling around him			1
@entity1 's shadow looms large over the new @entity4 manager from the directors ' box at every home game – and he will not be impressed with what he is seeing			1
this season at @entity46 has overseen @entity4 's first defeat by @entity48 since 1972 , the first defeat by @entity50 since 1978 and the first defeat by @entity52 since 1992			1
add their first home loss to @entity7 in 82 years and @entity3 has ended a total of 179 years of utter domination on their own turf over four top - flight clubs			1
@entity1 never lost four out of six home games , and that was in 27 years at the helm			0
his replacement has ' achieved ' that within eight months			0
the defeat by @entity7 was their fifth home loss in all competitions this season , already equalling their title - winning campaign last year			0
@entity16 emptied when @entity37 headed @entity7 's last - minute winner			1
under @entity1 most would 've stayed in the belief they could still get something from the game			0
lonely souls : @entity16 emptied quickly after @entity7 's second goal on sunday @entity3 is not helped by having @entity1 sat in the directors ' box , looking down on proceedings like a roman emperor overseeing a gladiatorial battle at the @entity82 and deciding at the end who lives and who dies by sticking his thumb in the air or pointing it to the ground			1
there is a flash of fear in the @entity4 manager 's eyes after every defeat at @entity16 as if he knows @entity1 could give him the thumbs down at any moment and he would be for the chop			1
off : @entity99 's reckless red card compounded problems for the champions against the @entity102 watching brief : sir @entity1 has been at plenty of @entity4 games this season and casts a shadow dejection : @entity108 looks on in disbelief with @entity4 at their lowest ebb for decades rub of the green : @entity3 has lamented refereeing decisions in recent weeks - notably against @entity114 click here to read @entity117 's assessment of @entity4 's 2 - 1 @entity13 defeat against @entity7			1
everyone says @entity3 deserves to be given time like @entity1 , but they are forgetting that @entity1 did n't inherit a title - winning team when he got the job in 1986			1
it took four years for him to win his first major trophy – the 1990 @entity13 – but when he took over they had n't won a top - flight title in 19 years			1
this @entity4 have won it five times in the past 10			1
@entity129 had three more @entity27 points after 20 games in charge at @entity133 than @entity3 's 34 now			2
the @entity134 lost his job shortly afterwards			0
being brutally honest , @entity3 simply does n't know how to compete with the giants of the game when it comes to transfers			2
his first marquee signing , buying @entity141 for £ 27.5million weeks after a £ 23m release clause expired , has so far been a disaster			0
disaster : @entity141 was @entity4 's marquee summer signing but has been a spectacular flop but @entity3 does n't know how to play with this kind of money			1
the average net spending per season during his 11 years at @entity52 was a mere £ 803,000			0
@entity1 would shell out tens of millions every summer like he was handing out sweets			0
@entity3 's admission after the defeat by @entity7 that @entity4 's transfer targets might not be available in january is alarming			1
@entity1 would never have come out with a comment like that			0
if @entity4 wanted a player , @entity4 got a player			2
@entity4 's credentials for finishing in a @entity161 spot are being seriously questioned now , let alone challenging for the title			2
@entity3 has presided over their worst points total from their opening 20 games in 22 years and they have won only two matches – versus @entity167 and @entity168 – against sides in the top half			1
they have been beaten by @entity133 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity114 twice , @entity52 and @entity48			0
thanks for coming ! @entity114 's 2 - 1 win on @entity175 was @entity4 's sixth league defeat of the season happy hunting ground : @entity179 scored the only goal when @entity48 won at @entity4 in early december never rains : the @entity48 defeat followed a 1 - 0 reverse against @entity52 , thanks to @entity185 's goal @entity186 claims that sir @entity1 watching @entity4 matches is n't helping @entity3 - click here for full story			1
@entity190 has managed only 13 appearances this season – a mere seven of those in the @entity27 – and , aged 35 , he is way past his peak			0
for many of his 12 years at @entity16 the former @entity198 defender has been the best centre back in the country but the player has admitted this season could be his last			1
@entity204 is being brought through as first - choice centre back by @entity3 , but the 24 - year - old has been a weak link in their defence			2
they have kept only two clean sheets in 13 league games with him in the side			0
@entity4 are unbeaten when @entity212 and @entity213 have started together			2
the only problem is , @entity3 has been able to field them in his first eleven only six times , winning four of those and drawing the other two			2
both of their futures at the club are in doubt			0
@entity212 wants to wait until after the @entity220 this summer to make a decision on signing a new contract and @entity3 has admitted if they do n't qualify for the @entity161 he may well leave			2
@entity225 's relationship with the @entity226 has also been strained			0
there were reports in @entity229 , denied by @entity3 , of a bust - up between the pair			2
while the @entity232 has been on fire when he 's played , with 16 goals in 20 appearances for club and country this season , he has missed the last month with a troublesome thigh injury			0
better together : @entity4 are unbeaten when @entity212 and @entity213 have started shock : @entity50 turned up at @entity4 in september and won thanks to @entity242 on the floor : the grounded @entity204 watches on as @entity244 scored for @entity173 in october @entity3 fears he will miss out on targets during this transfer window - click here to find out why			1
it is claimed that @entity225 was not happy with the new training methods implemented by @entity3 when he took charge			2
@entity3 is known to prefer short , sharp sessions , described as ' so hard ' by @entity212			2
after years of persistent injury problems @entity225 went on a run of 90 consecutive league matches , at both @entity167 and @entity4			1
that was ended when @entity3 took over			0
@entity3 has come under heavy criticism for his style of training , being branded ' prehistoric ' by one @entity232 football coach			0
down and out ? @entity190 limped off against @entity7 and is considering retirement after many injuries has training been a factor in the injuries that have hampered @entity4 this season ? along with @entity225 they are currently missing @entity141 with a wrist injury , @entity268 out with a knee problem , @entity267 's hamstring has gone and @entity271 has a strained his groin			1
@entity190 limped off the pitch against @entity7 , @entity212 is struggling with a groin injury and @entity275 damaged his shoulder against @entity114			0
@entity4 are one of the biggest brands on the planet , but that does not make them invincible			0
their financial forecasts for investors are all based on reaching the quarter - finals of each cup and finishing third in the @entity27			0
failure to achieve any of those targets – as is becoming increasingly likely – and next summer 's transfer budget could be significantly smaller .			0

@entity4 are struggling to finish in the top four and out of @entity13
only second time in *30* years they 've gone out in round three
@entity3 has presided over a dismal run of form at @entity16
@entity4 need to spend in january as injuries to key players mount
