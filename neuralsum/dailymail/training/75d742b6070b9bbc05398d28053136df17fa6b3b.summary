the prime minister has now revealed his plan to lose weight depends on cutting out carbohydrates			1
quizzed about his weight loss today , he told @entity27 : ' i ’m trying hard , it is a great patriotic struggle			2
' he attempted to blame the day job for his struggle , but admitted it was ' feeble '			1
' it ’s difficult when you ’re own the road a lot , ' he began			1
' this sounds like a feeble excuse			1
' mr @entity6 went on : ' i ’m trying my hardest , i ’m trying to go for a run every other day			1
i ’m trying to cut the intake			1
' pressed on whether his weakness was cake or other sweet treats , mr @entity6 said his ' downfall ' was snacking in the middle of the day			1
' that ’s the thing you ’ve got to cut out is n’t it			1
i ’m giving up the bread , bread ’s off			2
cut the carbs and go for a run			1
' it worked before , maybe it will work again , who knows			2
' but he said the being in the public eye meant he had to try to stay trim			2
' that ’s the trouble ... i ca n’t get away with it because people can judge pretty clearly whether the pounds have come off or gone on			2
' the new regime means the prime minister wo n't be able to enjoy toast in the morning when he catches up on the headlines using his ipad @entity6 pictured leaving @entity70 today and taking part in the @entity72 at @entity21 @entity6 is not the only politician to have struggled with his weight			1

' i have a bad habit of eating the children 's supper for breakfast , ' the @entity85 mayor revealed			2
@entity76 chancellor @entity92 and former @entity94 first minister @entity93 have both used the 5:2 diet to shed the pounds			2
but none have come close to @entity98 peer @entity97 who lost five stone thanks to a regime of @entity101 and apples			2
in 2013 , he revealed the existence of his breadmaker while being grilled about the rising cost of living			2
asked to identify a 47p budget loaf , he instead he ended up promoting artisan bread flour made in the @entity109 , costing five times more than a supermarket brand			2
four years in power has taken its toll on the waistlines of many members of the @entity114			2
a combination of stress , eating on the go and endless receptions with tempting - but high calorie - canapes means it is all too easy to pile on the pounds			0
the prime minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle - age spread			1
in an interview with @entity125 in 2012 he was asked about his @entity1 ’s resolutions and replied : ‘ probably to lose a bit of weight , i think			0

’ but today he insisted he never felt like he could not be ' bothered ' with the hassle of running the country			0
' i ’m passionate about this job , it ’s a huge honour to do it			0

' but it ’s an honour to do it			0
i ’m relatively young – at 48			0

director @entity149 said : ' to @entity6 , and anyone else who is cutting bread from their diet this january in the hope of losing weight , we urge them not to act so fast			1
' cutting bread from the diet could lead to compromising other essential nutrient intakes , such as fibre , calcium , protein and magnesium			0
' for those keeping fit , such as @entity6 who is a keen runner , starchy foods such as bread are crucial for keeping energy levels up			1

' all politicians fear being asked about the price of a pint of milk or a loaf of bread			0
none are struggling to make ends meet and few will notice the price as they - or their spouses - order online or whizz around @entity188			0
in 2013 @entity6 admitted being unsure about how much a supermarket loaf cost , but then compounded the error by revealing he did n't know because he bakes his own using a bread - making machine			1

instead he uses a £ 100 breadmaker and a brand of @entity109 artisan flour which costs around £ 4.40 a bag			0
in comparison a 1.5kg bag of @entity222 ’s own brand flour costs only 65p			0

a little plug for the flour made in my constituency : the @entity198			0
' you get some of that – beautifully milled in the @entity109 – you pop that in your breadmaker			0
