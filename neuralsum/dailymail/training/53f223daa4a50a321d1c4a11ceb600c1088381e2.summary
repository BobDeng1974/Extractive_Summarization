' i 'd heard about her , she 'd been on @entity12 and she 'd just started on @entity13 , but she did n't really have her image - she was a baby ' , @entity9 tells @entity15 , ' she was pretty fresh - faced , but i wanted to give her more of an image			1
i really , really loved @entity17 , that sex kitten with perfect features , but of course , this was of course a retro version , making it my own - and her own look			0

' we have a very , very close friendship , we 're like best friends			2
after all these years of working together and in all kinds of conditions , it 's been a non-stop wonderful ride			0
' at the age of 47 , mom - of - two @entity2 still maintains her tried and tested sex - bomb image - and @entity9 is still doing her make - up			1
' sometimes we go really sexy and sometimes we do nâ€™t , sometimes it 's more dramatic , smoky eyes or cat eyes , ' @entity9 says : ' we just did a gorgeous all black and white @entity70 inspired shoot with her shorter hair			2
we call the main look ' @entity31 ' and we have little names for all the other looks			2
' the pair are so close that @entity9 feels like an aunt to @entity2 's two sons , @entity79 , 18 , and @entity80 , 16 , with ex-husband , @entity81			1
bizarrely , @entity9 reveals that @entity2 is a strict mom - which seems at odds with her public persona , admitting : ' she 's a really good mom , a little bit strict , but she 's had to be			1
' and the boys are as far removed from @entity87 's grip as can be - despite having an actress and a wild rocker for parents			0
@entity9 says : ' they turned out wonderful , independent and little businessmen			2
they are very , very polite and i do n't know which one is more beautiful and they 're very smart , they got the best of both parents			0
stunning : even when she was just starting out , @entity2 was a natural			0

she even introduced the blonde to @entity135 , the @entity136 creator who put the statuesque model in his iconic adverts and made her his ' @entity139 '			0
she says : ' @entity132 was a blast , so sweet and a really genuinely caring person			2
i introduced her to @entity135			0
' i hate to say it , but @entity87 gobbled her up , everything happened so quickly for her , all the fame			0
she was n't highly educated and sometimes when people are more innocent and they come from a small town , @entity87 takes them off and they 're not really prepared with tools and stability			0
' her family was not good , and sadly , she got swept away with all of it			0
i tried for a long time , i did the best i could to keep her here for as long as possible			0
' she adds : ' we had many , many good times , but once she was so messed up i tried to hang in there with her , but she was n't taking any help that i was offering and we kind of drifted apart			0
' recalling the moment she found out that @entity132 had died , @entity9 says : ' we went to shoot in @entity158 with @entity2 and it was raining and raining and we were all stuck in this @entity159 was nothing playing on the tv in @entity162 , @entity156 was the only thing and it came on the news			1
' suddenly my phone was ringing , we were in the middle of nowhere and it was a wide awakening to what can happen in @entity87			0
' while @entity132 is a tragic tale , @entity2 , @entity9 says , ' has stayed true to herself , ' , adding : ' her parents are there for her , her mom always helps with the boys , they 're really good people , and she 's very intelligent			1
' in the genes : @entity132 replaced @entity176 as the face of @entity136 in 1992 having worked with some of the biggest names in @entity87 , @entity9 is now launching her own make - up kit			1
she says : ' most women learn from their mothers to put make - up on , they do n't use professional products , but the wonderful thing about my products is that you get a manual that teaches you step by step and in a couple of months you 're empowered			1
' you can become your own make - up artist , you 're getting my 25 years of secrets and techniques			1
' asked for her secrets on just who can act like a diva , @entity9 remains tight - lipped , and says : ' i 've only really come across a few people who can be a little difficult at times ! ' there must surely be those who turn up a little too much plastic surgery that will make - up hard - but she says : ' not that often , but it does happen			1
if they 've had filler in the lips , there can be a little too much swelling and it throws their face off balance			0
so i put foundation over their lips and then use powder and use my lip stain to go under the lip line			0
celebrity clients : @entity9 counts singer @entity218 , on let , and actress @entity220 , right , as a clients @entity223 's other clients include @entity220 , @entity218 and she counts @entity225 winner @entity224 among her favourites , calling her ' amazing and genuine			2
' @entity2 has three of @entity9 's kits at home , while @entity218 has four			2
