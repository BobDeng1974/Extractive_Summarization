by @entity0 going back to work after a relaxing weekend , you could be forgiven for drifting off at the end of a tiring monday for a quick cat nap			2
and this kitten appears to agree as it contemplates whether to fall asleep or stay awake			2
the animal , named @entity7 , was captured repeatedly dozing off on its owner 's lap at a house in @entity11			1
the adorable moment was filmed and posted on @entity21 by one of @entity7 's owners			1
footage shows the ginger - coloured kitten narrowing its eyes , before closing them completely			1
it then slowly tips its head backwards until it is nearly resting on the arm of its owner , who appears to be sending a message on his phone			0
should i stay or should i go ? @entity7 begins to narrow his eyes as his owner fails to pay attention to him , instead sending a message on his phone i 'll just rest my eyes for a minute : @entity7 seems to have decided that there 's nothing wrong with 40 winks , catching up on his beauty sleep @entity47 - fect : he slowly tips his head backwards until resting on the leg of his owner the cat 's whiskers : seemingly undecided as to whether to fall asleep - he abruptly wakes up , with his eyes shooting open			1
not for long though but seemingly undecided as to whether to fall asleep or not , the kitten then abruptly wakes up - its eyes shooting open and its arm flailing around			2
however , it is not long before the animal starts to drift off once more			0
