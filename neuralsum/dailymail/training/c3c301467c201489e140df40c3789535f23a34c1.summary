a @entity1 judge tuesday spared the life of a pit bull who mauled a 4 - year - old boy last month and touched off a controversial debate on mercy , blame and animal violence			1
@entity11 judge @entity10 ruled that the dog named @entity13 must be neutered , defanged and microchipped			2

an animal advocate in court burst into tears when hearing the dog would live			0
the february 20 attack left toddler @entity27 with a broken eye socket and jaw , and the boy has months , if not years , of reconstructive surgery ahead of him			1
the question of whether the pit bull should live or die attracted a team of top death penalty lawyers , led to candlelight vigils and riled up thousands of animal lovers on social media who placed blame with the dog 's owners and child 's baby sitter			1
meanwhile , donations and gifts from around the world have flowed in for @entity27 since the dog bit the boy in the face			0
witnesses testified that little @entity27 grabbed @entity13 's bone and dropped it when the dog growled			1

public outcry : the @entity88 petition to save @entity13 has almost 65,000 signatures ' it disturbed me at first that they placed more value on an animal than on a child , and that made me feel very bad , ' @entity27 told the @entity97 through a @entity99 interpreter			1
' if they do n't care about [ @entity27 ] , well , i do			0
' neither @entity27 nor the man who owned the dog attended the court hearing			0
@entity104 , whose boyfriend 's mother was looking after @entity27 the day of the attack , filed the vicious - dog court petition that started the case , saying @entity13 has a history of acting without provocation and killed one of her dogs			1
animal advocates struck back , saying both the dog and boy are victims and @entity27 's baby sitter was negligent in letting him play near the animal ' unsupervised			2
' life sentence : the white - and - brown pit bull will live out his days in an animal shelter without the possibility of ever being put up for adoption they also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up			1
on tuesday , @entity15 said several people shared some responsibility for the attack			0
the judge pointed out that there was a ' @entity136 ' sign on the property 's fence but the gate was left open and children were allowed to play near the dog			0
' this whole case has been very , very distressing to me , ' @entity15 said , adding that @entity27 will pay the price for the rest of his life			0
a half dozen animal rights advocates attended the hearing in t - shirts that bore a paw mark and a slogan , ' @entity13			1

' we were not here to put a dog above @entity27 , ' @entity154 said			0
' we were just here to make sure justice was served			0
' nightmare scenario : the dog grabbed @entity27 's face and would not let go , causing severe injuries eyewitness accounts : people who saw the attack testified that @entity27 grabbed a bone from @entity13 and then dropped it when the animal growled , but he did n't run , prompting the dog to attack @entity169 , who said he 's not related to anyone involved in the case , disagreed with the judge 's decision			1
' who is going to see to it five years from now that this dog still has n't been adopted out ? ' @entity169 said			0

on the @entity179 page , the pit bull 's supporters clarified tuesday evening that @entity13 's fangs will not be pulled out , but rather ground down			1
