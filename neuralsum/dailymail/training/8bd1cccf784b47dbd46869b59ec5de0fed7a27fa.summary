human cannonball @entity0 , 24 , as killed when the safety net intended to break his fall after he was fired into the air collapsed the death of a ' human cannonball ' who died after being fired into the air at a stunt show has been ruled an accident , an inquest has ruled			1
@entity0 suffered multiple injuries after a safety net intended to break his fall collapsed as he fell to the ground on april 25 , 2011			1
the 24 - year - old had been fired from a lorry - mounted cannon during @entity19 's @entity18 at the @entity20 in @entity21			1
an inquest , sitting at @entity23 , @entity24 , heard that a mechanism which triggered the release of the safety net was not properly set			1
tests carried out following the tragedy showed the mechanism could be unintentionally falsely closed , leading to the net dropping when the lorry recoiled upon firing of the cannon			2
in her closing remarks to jurors before they retired , @entity33 and @entity35 coroner @entity34 said it was ' undoubtedly a tragic case ' but she urged them to be dispassionate			1
she said : ' this is not a trial			0
it 's an inquest into a death , a fact - finding mission to find out how mr @entity0 died			1
there is no indictment , no criminal charge			0
' in its conclusion , the jury said : ' at some point during the firing of the cannonball , the safety net quick release mechanism activated prematurely as a result of it being incorrectly set			1
' as a result , @entity0 sustained multiple injuries			2
' mr @entity0 , who was living in @entity57 , had performed the showpiece five times before the tragedy and had joined the stunt team just one week before his death			1
@entity62 announced in december 2012 that no criminal prosecution would be brought over mr @entity0 's death			2
mr @entity0 could then be seen being propelled from the cannon amid a cloud of pyrotechnic smoke as the safety net in front of him suddenly collapsed			1
he later died at @entity82			0
mechanical engineer @entity83 , tested the safety net trigger mechanism and found that when the latch was fully closed , the net could not be released			2
but on a third occasion he engineered the mechanism so that it was falsely closed			0
on this occasion , the safety net did release when the vehicle recoiled as the cannon fired			2
pictures taken of the mechanism several months after mr @entity0 's death showed a build - up of dirt and grease on it			2
mr @entity83 said that dirt or grit could have impacted on the mechanism 's performance , but he could not confirm whether this contributed to the failing or not			0
mr @entity0 suffered multiple injuries when he plunged to the ground after being fired from this cannon in footage shown at the inquest , one of mr @entity0 's colleagues was heard giving a ' 3 , 2 , 1 ' countdown on the public address system before he shouted ' fire ' mr @entity0 , who was living in @entity57 , had performed the showpiece five times before the tragedy and had joined the stunt team just a month before his death a second expert , @entity119 , a specialist inspector in mechanical engineering , said it appeared the trigger had not been set ' to the end of its travel '			1

mr @entity133 , who has no formal mechanical qualifications but has years of experience , was asked how he would ensure that the lug engaged with the latch			0
he told the inquest : ' for me , it was the noise , like a car door when you hear it has been engaged			0
' whenever he set the mechanism , mr @entity133 said he would do so using force ' to make sure it was in every time '			0
mr @entity133 said the trigger release mechanism , which was partly in a sealed unit , was routinely pressure washed , lubricated using @entity158 and checked for fatigue			0
he said there were equipment checks before each performance and more in - depth maintenance during breaks between performances			0
as mr @entity0 was fired out of the cannon , the net collapsed , causing him to land on the ground expert @entity119 , a specialist inspector in mechanical engineering , said it appeared the trigger had not been set ' to the end of its travel ' in her closing remarks to jurors before they retired , @entity33 and @entity35 coroner @entity34 said it was ' undoubtedly a tragic case ' but she urged them to be dispassionate at the time of mr @entity0 's death , his friends described him as a ' thrill - seeker ' who opted out of his promising academic career and his conventional middle - class upbringing motorcycle stuntman @entity19 said said the showpiece stunt had been performed about 1,000 times the tragedy happened in front of the assembled crowds who had paid Â£ 12 to see the stunt show mr @entity0 had suffered serious injuries to his heart , head and chest and died in the ambulance after suffering a cardiac arrest two minutes before arriving at hospital , the inquest was told @entity62 announced in december 2012 that no criminal prosecution would be brought over the incident asked whether he had ever encountered problems with the net release trigger mechanism not setting properly , he replied : ' no , never			1
