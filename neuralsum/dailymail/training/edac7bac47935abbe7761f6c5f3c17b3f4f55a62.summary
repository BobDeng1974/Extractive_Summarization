by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:17 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 10:10 est , 26 july 2013 upset : actor @entity2 and his wife @entity3 the wife of actor @entity2 criticised the @entity5 last night for an interview with @entity7 in which he blamed the @entity9 scandal on ‘ dishonest ’ reporting			1
@entity11 said yesterday ’s edition of flagship @entity15 programme @entity14 featuring the comedian was ‘ very , very nasty to hear ’ and an ‘ insult ’ to her husband			1
and she accused the corporation of helping @entity7 promote his new comedy tour by allowing him on a string of recent programmes , including @entity23 and the @entity24			1
brand used his radio appearance to provide his own version of the 2008 scandal , in which he and presenter @entity29 left a series of obscene messages on mr @entity2 ’s answerphone during @entity7 ’s @entity35 programme			1
the incident provoked 42,000 complaints after @entity7 boasted of sleeping with mr @entity2 ’s granddaughter and joked that the 83 - year - old former @entity40 star might hang himself as a result of the phone calls			1
brand later resigned while @entity29 was suspended			2
but interviewed by @entity14 presenter @entity44 , 38 - year - old @entity7 suggested the controversy was manufactured by the @entity46 and media outlets with a ‘ pre-existing agenda ’			1
brand insisted he is now ‘ contrite ’ , but mrs @entity11 said last night : ‘ he did n’t apologise			2
it was a pathetic little rendition of what actually happened			2
‘ and the thing that upset me the most was that he claimed people were n’t upset by what he and @entity29 did to @entity24			2
he said it was the @entity46 which had whipped up public opinion			1
that simply is n’t true			2
people were very upset because of the terrible abuse we endured			2
’ tasteless : @entity7 , left , and @entity29 singing an apology to @entity2 on @entity35 criticising the @entity5 ’s decision to invite @entity7 on @entity14 , the 79 - year - old added : ‘ what we had to listen to was disgusting and unnecessary			1
it was very , very nasty to hear			2
@entity24 has spent a lifetime working at the @entity5			0
’ brand has appeared on a string of @entity5 programmes since announcing his @entity71 world tour last month , including @entity23 , the @entity24 and the radio 1 breakfast show			0
criticising the @entity5 for giving him so much airtime , mrs @entity11 said : ‘ a lot of water has passed under the bridge since that humiliating phone call and , knowing how the @entity5 always look after their own , i am surprised that they consider @entity7 to be one of them			1
‘ my husband and i are rather surprised that he ’s got away with it			0
we try not to think about what happened and remember the hundreds of letters of support we received at the time			0
but he did not apologise [ on @entity14 ]			0
’ further controversy : @entity7 suggested it was a ' dishonest scandal ' that was hijacked by those against the @entity5 during his @entity15 appearance , @entity7 insisted he was sorry for making the notorious phone call , saying : ‘ i am contrite			1
anything that damages something i love , i ’m going to feel sorry for			0
' and i feel sorry also because the story i tell myself , of myself , is not that i ’m a man that is rude to people who are in a position of vulnerability			0
’ but he said the subsequent controversy was the product of ‘ a pre-existing agenda in privately owned media to destabilise , attack and diminish the @entity5 ’			0
despite admitting that those who complained in the wake of the scandal were genuinely offended , he added : ‘ that was a dishonest scandal ... the thing that the 42,000 people were offended by is offensive			1
it is offensive if someone calls up an answerphone , does some swearing , hangs up			0
' but if incrementally that act is led to by a series of innuendos and in - jokes , then it ’s a different thing			0
it ’s still a thing that is wrong , but it ’s not the thing that they ’re offended by			0
’ following the @entity9 scandal the @entity5 was fined £ 150,000 by @entity128 , the controller of @entity35 resigned and the @entity5 issued multiple on - air apologies			1
last night a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ @entity14 features a range of people from scientists to politicians , academics and actors			0
@entity44 asks and challenges the castaways about the defining and at times controversial moments in their lives , as she did on this occasion as well			0

@entity7 , 38 , left obscene messages on @entity2 ' *machine*
the incident *dubbed* ' @entity9 ' provoked 42,000 complaints
now @entity7 says @entity46 had ' whipped up public opinion '
