@entity1 attack : @entity2 , secretary of the @entity3 , says teachers are being driven out of the profession early because of excessive workload and the fear of @entity9 inspections soaring numbers of teachers are taking early retirement amid threats to their pensions , figures revealed yesterday			1
almost 9,000 teachers left before the statutory retirement age last year – the highest figure since 1997			1
teachers ’ leaders blamed the demands of dealing with unruly pupils as well as pressure from targets and @entity9 inspections			1
they also cited pay freezes and changes requiring teachers to pay more into pension funds			1
the figures – from the @entity30 – also show more than 230,000 qualified teachers aged under 60 are no longer working in schools			1
a further 80,700 trained as teachers but never entered the classroom			2
vast numbers of teachers are ‘ out of service ’ even though school rolls will rise after a surge in births			2
the teachers ’ pension age is 65 but those joining prior to 2007 can get their pension at 60			2
some 8,880 state school teachers took early retirement in 2010/11 – 1,570 more than the year before			2
there were only 2,370 early retirements in 1998/99			0
most retiring teachers were aged 55 to 59 but a small number were in their early fifties			0
the average pension for those retiring early was £ 15,000 a year – excluding lump sums			0
@entity2 , general secretary of the @entity3 , said : ‘ excessive workload , a restrictive curriculum and the intense worry and fear regarding @entity9 inspections would certainly lead to many teachers wanting to take early retirement			1
' intense worry : the demands of dealing with unruly pupils , pay freezes and higher pension costs were also cited as reasons for the exodus of teachers she added : ' the teaching profession comes under almost daily attack and criticism from @entity72 and @entity9			1
‘ in too many schools , planning and assessment requirements have become formulaic burdens which have become the bane of teachers ’ lives – add to that pay freezes and threats to pensions			1
’ teaching unions are battling the government over pensions , which are becoming less generous due to the squeeze on public finances			0
the clash has already led to strikes			0
@entity88 , a former head teacher and chairman of the @entity90 , said : ‘ it is a tough job and it ’s not surprising teachers are being ground down by teaching disaffected children and relying on a curriculum that is not relevant			0
’ a @entity30 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s no surprise that teachers who joined the profession in the 1970s might choose to draw their pensions early – as is their right			0
’ he said reforms , including giving teachers more freedom to do their jobs , should help attract and retain staff .			0
