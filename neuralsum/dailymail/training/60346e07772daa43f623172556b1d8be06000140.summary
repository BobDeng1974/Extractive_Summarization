pumped - up education secretary @entity0 this morning angrily rejected claims @entity2 was still meddling in schools policy – insisting : ' i 'm in charge			1
' mrs @entity6 dismissed as ' complete nonsense ' revelations that her predecessor is receiving confidential documents from her department despite being sacked six months ago			1
the cabinet minister , a former high - powered lawyer , added she had previously seen off men trying to tell her what to do – by rejecting her vicar 's attempt to get her to ' obey ' her husband when she got married			1
mrs @entity6 said the vicar had ' lost that battle ' , adding : ' i did n't use those words			1
' the education secretary , speaking on the @entity24 's @entity23 show this morning , also suggested she had won a behind - the - scenes battle with the military against further cuts to the schools budget			1
but the @entity37 minister made clear that the ringfence would apply to education for five to 16 - year - olds but did not commit to similar protections for early years or further education			2
her comments came as prime minister @entity44 was applying the finishing touches to a speech that is expected to further outline the @entity37 ' education plans tomorrow			2
part of the plan will be for all pupils to pass tough new exams before leaving primary school as part of a ' war on illiteracy and innumeracy '			0
as well as demonstrating mathematical skills , pupils will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use ' accurate punctuation , spelling and grammar '			0
by the time they leave primary school all 11 year - olds will know their times tables , be able to read a novel , and be able to write a short story under the plans			0
despite announcing the new policy today , mrs @entity6 was forced to fend off claims that her predecessor as @entity0 was acting as a backseat driver from his position as chief whip			1
ms @entity6 said : ' i think this is a complete load of nonsense			2
@entity2 has been nothing but supportive as have other former education secretaries			2
' i am very much in charge of the @entity81 and we are all as @entity84 colleagues united in what we want to see			0
' the education secretary , speaking on the @entity24 's @entity23 show this morning , also suggested she had won a behind - the - scenes battle with the military against further cuts to the schools budget the @entity92 could be merged with the army ’s elite airborne brigade and taken out of the @entity95 , under plans being considered to cope with a new round of military cuts			1
government officials are looking at a proposal to create a joint airborne and amphibious force , which would see the marines put under the control of the army , according to the @entity105			0
the radical proposal is being drawn up as senior military figures brace themselves for further swingeing defence cuts , amid signs the @entity81 has won the battle for funding with the @entity112			1
@entity44 and @entity113 have refused to ring - fence defence spending – with experts warning this could mean further cuts to the defence budget of up to 26 per cent after 2015/16			1
mrs @entity6 said more needed to be done to promote ' @entity120 values ' in schools			2
she said headteachers needed to promote ' democracy , rule of law , individual liberty , and … respect for people of other faiths and other beliefs '			0
but she admitted that values changed as time went on , adding : ' i remember having a debate with the vicar before i got married about whether i was going to obey my husband			1
' my husband said ' have a go , i think you 're going to lose that battle ' – and he did , and i did n't use those words			1
' that 's why things do change and i think those are the core values and i think it is important that all our schools are promoting them			2
as i say , the best schools are doing this already			0
' but mrs @entity6 said it was an ' outrage ' that under the last government ' one in three people were leaving primary school unable to read or write properly '			0
she said the new reading and writing targets for primary school were ' what parents and families would expect as a minimum from our exam system '			0
mrs @entity6 added : ' as i say , we have to be ambitious for our young people : if we do n't get it right in primary it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they 're in secondary schools			2
' headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the @entity84 are returned to power , she indicated			0
' we have to be ambitious for our young people , if we do n't get it right at primary then it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they are in secondary schools , ' she said			2
ms @entity6 hopes the tests will help @entity178 to the top of the class in @entity182 league tables for @entity178 and maths by 2020 , as well as in the top five internationally - a significant leap from the current ranking of 23rd			0
@entity187 education secretary @entity186 claimed the government 's schools policy was allowing more unqualified teachers into classrooms which was damaging @entity178 's international position in education			1
the @entity195 frontbencher said : ' @entity44 's flawed schools policy is damaging our education system and failing to close the learning gap between disadvantaged children and the rest			1
' many parents will be shocked to learn that @entity44 's government has changed the rules to allow unqualified teachers into the classroom on a permanent basis , leading to a 16 % rise in the last year alone			0
' @entity187 education secretary @entity186 claimed the government 's schools policy was allowing more unqualified teachers into classrooms he added : ' the surest way to raise standards in every lesson , in every school , is to improve the quality of teaching in the classroom			1
' that begins with an end to @entity44 's unqualified teachers policy			2
@entity195 will ensure that all teachers are qualified and continue to train to improve their teaching as a condition to remaining in the classroom			0
' this is how we improve the learning and life chances for all children and raise our international position in reading , writing and maths			0
' a spokesman for @entity2 said the claim , reported in the @entity232 on sunday , that he was meddling in education policy was untrue			1
the spokesman said : ' this is total nonsense , as usual			0
i 'm surprised a paper which employs the brilliant @entity238 would print rubbish like this			0
' a @entity242 spokesman added : ' @entity232 on sunday 's story is totally untrue			0
the chief whip 's office has not received , handled or put into the red box any of the @entity0 's paperwork			1

@entity0 rejects claims @entity2 still meddling in schools policy
claims it 's ' complete nonsense ' he is receiving files from her department
minister also revealed she refused to ' obey ' her husband in wedding vows
she said the vicar had ' lost that battle ' , adding : ' i did n't use those words '
