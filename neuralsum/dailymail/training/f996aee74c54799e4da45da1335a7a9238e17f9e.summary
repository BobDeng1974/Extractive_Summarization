@entity1 and @entity2 leaders in @entity3 will face some resistance in a vote to authorize president @entity7 's war against @entity9 militants despite international outrage over video of militants beheading their captives and burning one alive			1
war authorizations are among the most difficult issues confronting members of @entity3			2
several @entity2 will be reluctant to approve new war powers unless there is a clear deadline or some way to pay for the military operation			0
some republicans , strong foes of the president , will object to giving @entity7 the authority			0
@entity7 is poised in coming days to ask @entity3 for new authority to use @entity28 military force against the @entity30 terror army , the @entity25 said thursday			1
but the top @entity25 @entity1 warned it wo n't be easy to pass the measure			2
speaker @entity32 , an @entity33 @entity1 , said it will be up to the president to rally support from lawmakers and the public			1
president @entity7 is getting his act together and plans to ask @entity3 for a new bombing permission - slip , following months of his relying on war powers resolutions approved 13 and 14 years ago house speaker @entity32 , an @entity33 @entity1 , is not making any guarantees and says @entity7 's request ' is not going to be an easy lift ' after months of acting unilaterally ' his actions are going to be an important part of trying for us to get the votes to actually pass an authorization , ' @entity32 said thursday			1
' this is not going to be an easy lift			1
' in the @entity28 battle against @entity30 , @entity7 has been relying on congressional authorizations that president @entity55 used to justify military action after the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
critics say the @entity25 's use of post- 9/11 congressional authorizations is a legal stretch , at best			0
@entity7 has insisted that he had the legal authority to send @entity28 troops to train and assist @entity65 security forces , and to launch airstrikes since september against targets in @entity65 and @entity68			0
now , the administration wants to get a new so - called authorization for the @entity71 , or @entity72 , with bipartisan support from @entity3			1
' the president believes it sends a very powerful signal to the @entity28 people , to our allies , and even to our enemies , that the @entity28 is united behind this strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy @entity30 , ' @entity25 spokesman @entity74 said , using an alternative acronym for the ' @entity9 ' terror group			1
republicans generally want a broader authorization of military action against the militants than @entity2 have been willing to consider			0
@entity7 has said he does not intend to deploy @entity28 combat troops , though many republicans believe that option ought to be available			0
' i have always believed that when it comes to fighting a war that @entity3 should not tie the president 's hands , ' @entity32 said			1
@entity74 declined to discuss specific provisions being considered , such as how long the authorization will last , what geographical areas it will cover and whether it will allow for ground troops			0
he said details were still being worked out with lawmakers from both parties			0
@entity104 democrat @entity103 of @entity105 said talks with the administration are focusing on an authorization that would last three years , with other issues still being debated			2
@entity103 told journalists it will be a challenge for @entity2 , the @entity25 and @entity1 to forge an agreement , but that she ultimately expects one to be reached			0
' i 'm not saying anybody 's come to an agreement on it , ' @entity103 said			0
' i think it 's going to be a challenge , but we will have it			0
' @entity103 said she hopes @entity3 will repeal the 2002 congressional authorization for the war in @entity65 but retain the 2001 authorization for military action in @entity124			1
@entity74 said the @entity25 also supports repeal of the @entity65 authorization replaced by the new authorization			0
late last year , secretary of state @entity128 said whatever new authorization @entity3 passes should not limit @entity28 military action to @entity65 and @entity68 or prevent the president from deploying ground troops if he later deems them necessary			1
he also said that if the new authorization had a time limit , there should be a provision for it to be renewed			0
barbarians ! : @entity30 posted a video online this week showing the intentional burning death of @entity141 pilot @entity142 @entity143 : @entity144 known for its brutal massacres of ' infidels ' â€“ including @entity148 who do n't back their rigid brand of @entity150 showing its age : @entity7 's authority for airstrikes against @entity30 is a 2002 authorization that president @entity55 got for his war in @entity65 @entity9 militants released a grisly video this week of a @entity141 @entity159 pilot being burned alive inside a cage			1
@entity103 said that the @entity28 should ' move quickly ' to steer military aid to @entity141 , which has stepped up a campaign against the militants , including a series of airstrikes in @entity68			0
@entity105 rep. @entity166 , the top @entity167 on the @entity25 intelligence panel , already introduced authorization legislation rather than wait for @entity7 's version			2
his bill would authorize the use of force against @entity30 in @entity65 and @entity68 for three years , but prohibit the use of ground forces in a combat mission in either nation			2
he has said if the president later decided to deploy ground troops , he could return to @entity3 to ask for new authority			2
' it is my hope that the administration will be willing to accept important limits in a new authorization as well as the sunset or repeal of the old @entity189 , as this will be necessary to ensure strong bipartisan support and meet the goals the president set last summer of refining and repealing the prior authorizations , ' @entity166 said in a statement .			1

the administration wants a new so - called ' authorization for the @entity71 ' and expects bipartisan support from @entity3
but he 's been bombing @entity30 since september without any @entity202 *buy* - in , justifying it with an @entity72 that dates back to 2002
house speaker @entity32 says he does n't want to tie the president 's hands but ' this is not going to be an easy lift '
