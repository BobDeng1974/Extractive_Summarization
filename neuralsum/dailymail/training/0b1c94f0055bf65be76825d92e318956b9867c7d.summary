last weekend , ' @entity0 ' saw a record 700 auctions held across @entity2 , continuing the housing bubble trend of skyrocketing prices offered up for questionable properties			1
the weekend could have been labelled ' @entity6 saturday ' , as several of the residences which drew top dollar were so in shambles that they were uninhabitable			0
this @entity13 residence which was literally crumbling down when it went under the hammer , and yet still managed to fetch $ 2.68 million - a staggering $ 830,000 over the reserve price			1
the property was described as a ' blank canvas ' , offering ' the opportunity of a lifetime for the astute and imaginative buyer ' , despite the property not having a functional kitchen or bathroom			2
' it certainly was n't liveable ' , @entity25 agent told @entity27			0
however , the drawcards of the house were enough to sway many prospective home owners , who saw the panoramic views of @entity32 as enough to take the risk of bidding on the property			0
3 @entity35 was bought by @entity37 ' downsizers ' who were reportedly planning to spend a further $ 600,000 renovating the residence before moving in			0
the trend continued with several other properties , including an ' abandoned warehouse ' at 164 - 166 @entity50 , @entity51			0
the residence sold for $ 1,725,000 on monday , despite the new owners being threatened by the previous tenants - squatters who had made the ' dilapidated shell ' their home			2
the previous owner had paid a mere $ 68,000 for the property in 1981 , and chose not to renovate before selling up last week			1

the second 23 lower @entity86 , sold for $ 2,685,000 – $ 985,000 above the reserved asking price			2
the extraordinary sale prices reflect the continuing ' price bubble ' , which housing analysts have predicted will continue indefinitely			1

@entity91 advises that many agents will start their campaigns after the october long weekend			0
' they 're ready to flick the switch , ' he said , ' they have all the photos taken and are just waiting for the right time			0
' ' at the moment it 's a bit of a @entity110 standoff , where people do n't want to put their property up if they ca n't find somewhere to live			0
it 'll loosen eventually , but just be aware of the trends			0

limited housing stock is driving the sale prices up , which will only continue until more is released onto the *market*
