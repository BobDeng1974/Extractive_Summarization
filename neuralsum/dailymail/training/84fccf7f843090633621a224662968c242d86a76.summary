a statement on her website outlines why she initially quit the conservatives for @entity6			2
it says : ' i left the @entity55 because i no longer believe it is the party of freedom , aspiration , wealth creation and individualism ; because i believe @entity67 is doing to the @entity55 what @entity68 did to the @entity70 ; because @entity6 is the only party that promotes the values that originally led me to the conservatives and because this " @entity14 - led " government submits to every liberal - left piety imaginable			1
