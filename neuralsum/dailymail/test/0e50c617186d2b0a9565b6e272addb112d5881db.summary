flight cancellations soared by 20 per cent and delays by 7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015			1

it 's low - cost carrier monarch that has seen the greatest increase in delays so far , with passengers suffering 64 incidents compared to 47 during the same period of time last year			2
that 's an increase of 30 per cent			0
and @entity25 has n't fared much better , experiencing a 19 per cent increase in delays			1
during last year 's first quarter , there were a reported 206 hold - ups , while this year has already seen 245			0
however , airlines are refuting the figures			0
a spokesperson fro @entity34 said : ' the recent media report in regards to the on time performance during the first quarter of this year is incorrect and misleading			1
' for clarity , during the first quarter of 2015 we experienced winter weather across @entity43 which has been far worse than the same period last year , which particularly affected our operation to and from @entity46 , as well as the recent the @entity46 @entity48 strike which affected many carriers across @entity43			0
it should be noted that during this time frame @entity34 â€™ did not cancel any flights			2
' in the event of strikes or weather disruption , the business model of many other airline carriers is to cancel services ; which will protect their on - time performance , but of course have a negative impact on their customers			0
' @entity34 will only cancel flights if there is absolutely no viable way of operating that flight thus placing the highest value on getting customers to their destination as opposed to protecting our on - time performance by tactically cancelling our flights			2
' low - cost carrier monarch has fared the worst so far in 2015 , experiencing a 30 % increase in delays despite all the hold ups , it 's been a good year for @entity80 , which has reduced its delays by 37 % but it may not be entirely the fault of the airlines			1
monarch - 39 % increase @entity25 - 19 % increase @entity88 - 17 % increase virgin - 7 % increase @entity90 - 6 % increase @entity92 - 6 % increase @entity93 - 11 % decrease @entity80 - 37 % decrease winter weather across @entity43 this year has been far worse than the same period last year and has particularly affected @entity88 , @entity25 and @entity34 's routes to @entity98 and @entity99 in @entity46			1
similarly , delays and cancellations could also be attributed to a number of strikes on the continent			2
the four - day @entity106 strike in march resulted in some 116 cancellations of flights to the @entity4			0
strikes by @entity111 @entity110 and security staff in @entity113 also compounded such a problem			0
still , despite the external factors , it 's been a good year for @entity80 , which has reduced delays by 37 per cent , and @entity93 also saw an 11 per cent reduction in stoppages			2
@entity34 contests the @entity7 figures , however , telling @entity122 that ' their source of information is questionable			1
' they claim that their data comes directly from the aircrafts on board acars and ads - b systems , but @entity34 use neither of these			0
' the reason that our @entity132 figures appear higher than other airlines is due to the fact that we have not cancelled any flights			0
' we put our customers before our otp and would rather operate with a delay than not at all			0

in the first four months of the year , flight cancellations are up 20 % over last
number of delays have also increased 7 % up to 2,427 so far this year
according to @entity7 , the worst *offenders* *include* : @entity34 and @entity25
