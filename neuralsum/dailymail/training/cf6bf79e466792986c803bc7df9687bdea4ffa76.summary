' when i went through my statement i saw that they were charges for @entity2			0
' i did n’t even know that it was storing my information , and even if that thought had entered my head i would have thought there would be something in place so it was n’t so easy to spend money			2
' with sites like @entity90 and @entity91 it always asks you for a password before you make a purchase			0

' i think it ’s a big problem , i ’ve spoken to other parents and parents online who ’ve had the same happen to them			1
' i would have thought they ’d be a bit more helpful with parents but once they ’ve got the money they just say " it ’s not our problem "			2
