by @entity1 reporter published : 05:19 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 09:54 est , 7 september 2012 when @entity3 planted a few cucumber seeds , he was envisaging being able to use the home - grown produce to make a bit of salad for himself and his wife to enjoy			1
but the 86 - year - old , from @entity11 , @entity12 , might have to invite a few more friends and family round to share in the feast after coming up with this bumper crop			1
the grandfather of five 's gardening efforts produced a colossal 21 - inch cucumber weighing more than three times the average			1
@entity3 , 86 , pictured , from @entity11 , @entity12 , has grown cucumber more than triple the average mr @entity3 's wife , @entity24 , 85 , discovered the mammoth crop hiding behind a leaf in greenhouse last week some of the @entity29 's most super-sized vegetables are showcased every year at the @entity30			1
the monster veg can be so gigantic that forklift trucks are used to move them into display			0
a new world - record breaking 18.5ft parsnip was one of more than 200 vegetables unveiled at the competition in the @entity41 town of @entity42 last weekend			2
the root vegetable is an eye - popping 36 times bigger than the standard parsnip and was lovingly grown by @entity46 , 68 , from @entity47 , @entity48			2
the retired chartered surveyor has previously held the world record for a 8lbs 40oz potato			0
he has also been the double @entity53 holder for the heaviest parsnip , at 13lb , and the longest beetroot , at 21ft			0
the veteran grower 's record - busting reputation is rivalled by @entity58 , 56 , from @entity59 , @entity48			2
he snapped up the world record for the longest carrot , which he grew to an enormous 19ft 2inches in 2007			2
he also held the world record for the heaviest leek , at 6.6kg , in 2001			0
his wife stumbled across his monster vegetable - which is twice as long as a normal cucumber - in their greenhouse after the couple had forgot about the seeds mr @entity3 planted last march			1
last week @entity24 , 85 , discovered the three - and - a - half pound vegetable hidden behind a large leaf			1
mr @entity3 said : ' i could n’t believe what she was holding in her hands really - i thought it was a dead animal or something			1
' ' it was so huge but then when we eventually came down we realised it was a cucumber			0
' ' it looks more like a marrow than a cucumber as i did n’t think a cucumber could grow this big			0
' ' i just could n’t believe it			0
it is the biggest one i have grown by some distance			0
' the average cucumber normally weighs in at around 1lbs and measures 10inches in length			1
however , the couple ’s greenhouse giant can not live up to @entity96 farmer @entity95 's world - record - breaking cucumber			1
it measured an enormous 5ft 7inches long and weighed a staggering 154lbs			0
mrs @entity100 admitted their impressive effort was a complete accident , adding : ' it is a fluke as far as we are concerned			0
' but the couple are at odds with what to do with their mammoth vegetable			0
mr @entity3 joked : ' we might eat it , although it would come in handy if you had a few words with your missus or your husband - wallop , take that			1
' for now , the impressive cucumber has become a major talking point in the couple ’s kitchen			0
the @entity3 's granddaughter @entity123 , 29 , said : ' i was impressed when i came in and saw it on the kitchen side and i said ‘ i need a photo of that ’			2
' mr @entity3 's cucumber is still some way off rivalling @entity131 's record - breaking 154lbs whopper , pictured			1

@entity3 , 86 , forgot about the bumper crop he planted in his greenhouse in @entity11 , @entity12 , last march
@entity24 , 85 , found the enormous vegetable hiding behind leaf last week
the three - and - a - half pound cucumber weighs more than triple the average
