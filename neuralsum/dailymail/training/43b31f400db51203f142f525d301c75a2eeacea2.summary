a short entry in the @entity1 describes how in @entity3 ships landed on @entity5 's shores and immediately killed a local official who welcomed them			2
this was just the beginning of what would become a long history of vicious raids and fierce battles between the @entity14 and the @entity15			1
now , archaeologists have uncovered a ring - shaped fortress that historians believe was used to train @entity19 ahead of a large invasion of @entity15 in 1013			1
the newly discovered fortress is large at 475ft ( 145 metres ) from side to side and is the same shape as a typical @entity25 plan , with four ' gates ' like the one pictured above located in @entity29 on the @entity31 island of @entity32 - around 30 miles ( 48km ) south of @entity28 - the fortress is only the fifth of its kind to be discovered – and the first in 60 years			1
‘ @entity19 have a reputation as a berserker and pirates			0
it comes as a surprise to many that they were also capable of building magnificent fortresses , ’ said @entity36 , professor of medieval archaeology at @entity37			0
‘ the discovery of the new @entity3 fortress is a unique opportunity to gain new knowledge about @entity3 war and conflicts , and we get a new chance to examine the @entity19 ' most famous monuments			2
’ @entity54 , curator of @entity55 , said that precise new laser measurements of the landscape led her to the hidden circular fortress , which is large at 475ft ( 145 metres ) from side to side			1
located in @entity29 on the @entity31 island of @entity32 ( both marked ) - around 30 miles ( 48km ) south of @entity28 - the fortress is only the fifth of its kind to be discovered – and the first in 60 years @entity63 ( pictured ) have uncovered a ring - shaped fortress that historians believe was used to train @entity19 ahead of a large invasion of @entity15 in 1013 ‘ we recognise the “ @entity25 ” fortresses by the precise circular shape of the ramparts and by the four massive gates that are directed at the four corners of the compass , ’ dr @entity54 explained			1
trelleborgs are ring - shaped @entity3 fortresses			0
they were all built in a circular shape with a rampart and four gateways			1
a total of five are known to exist - located in modern @entity31 and the south of @entity81			1
the majority of trelleborgs have been dated to the reign of the @entity85 of @entity31 who died in @entity87			2
the newly - discovered @entity29 fortress is thought to date back to the late tenth century , and could have been built at the request of the king			1
but some experts think it was made by his son , @entity93 , who was the first @entity31 king of @entity15			1
they say it could have been used as a military training camp or barracks from which to launch his invasions of @entity15			1
@entity101 took control of @entity103 in 1013 and was soon afterwards declared to be @entity101 of @entity15			2
‘ our investigations show that the new fortress was perfectly circular and had sturdy timber along the front ; we have so far examined two gates , and they agree exactly with the “ @entity25 ” plan			1
it is a marvellous find			0
’ some historians think that the geometric design of the @entity113 - which are named after the location of the first one discovered - was inspired by old @entity116 army camps			2
dr @entity36 said that the find was the result of considerable detective work			0
‘ we suspected that one fortress was ' missing ' in the island @entity32			1
' the location at @entity29 was quite the right setting in the landscape : in a place where the old main roads met and reached out to @entity126 river valley , in the @entity127 was a navigable fjord and one of @entity32 's best natural harbours			1
from there we worked our way forward step by step			0
’ dr @entity54 said that the fortress was an active military camp and probably the scene of considerable fighting			1
‘ we can see that the gates were burned - down			2
in the north gate we found massive , charred oak posts			2
’ a short entry in the @entity1 describes how in @entity3 ships landed on @entity5 's shore and immediately killed a local official who welcomed them – and this was just the beginning with more vicious raids and fierce battles to come , with @entity103 taken by @entity19 ( actors pictured ) in @entity151 dr @entity36 said : ' the location at @entity29 ( pictured ) was quite the right setting in the landscape [ for the fortress ] : in a place where the old main roads met and reached out to @entity126 river valley , in the @entity127 was a navigable fjord and one of @entity32 's best natural harbors			1
from there we worked our way forward step by step			0
’ @entity162 , an expert in archaeological geophysics from the @entity164 , measured small variations in the @entity167 ’s magnetism to find features without damaging the site			0
dr @entity36 explained : ‘ in this way we achieved an amazingly detailed “ ghost image ” of the fortress in a few days			2
then we knew exactly where we had to put in excavation trenches to get as much information as possible about the mysterious fortress			0
’ she is sure the site dates from the @entity127 because of its distinctive design			0
samples of the burned wood are being carbon dated to provide more accurate dating			0
‘ if we can establish exactly when the fortress was built , we may be able to understand the historic events , which the fortress was part of			0
’ dr @entity54 is eager to find out whether the castle will turn out to be from the time of @entity85 , like the previously known fortresses , or perhaps a former king 's work			0
‘ as a military fortification from the @entity127 , the monument may help to unravel the position of @entity32 in relation to the oldest @entity31 kingdom , ’ she said			1
so far , only small parts of the fortress have been excavated			2
dr @entity36 said : ‘ this is really exciting			0
a find like this does not happen many times in his life - time			0
‘ the excavation has confirmed far more than we dared hope , but there is much more to learn			0
‘ the next big question is whether there were large buildings inside the castle , as in the known @entity25 fortresses			1
‘ the find also raises the question as to whether there will be more new @entity3 fortresses to discover			0
the exploration will be a wonderful journey of discovery			0

the fortress was discovered on the @entity31 island of @entity32 around 30 miles ( 48km ) south of @entity28 , but very little has been excavated
it 's the first @entity25 fortress to be found in 60 years . it was identified by the precise circular shape of the ramparts and by its four massive gates
the fortress is large at 475ft ( 145 metres ) from side to side
it could have been used as a military training camp or barracks from which to launch invasions of @entity15 in the tenth century
