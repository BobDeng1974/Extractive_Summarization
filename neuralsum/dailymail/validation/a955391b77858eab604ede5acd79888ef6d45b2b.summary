@entity0 picks his @entity2 squad on thursday for a @entity4 qualifier against @entity5 and a friendly against @entity7			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were named to face @entity12 in november			2
@entity13 is fit again now too , but there are three new boys on the block			2
so what do the likes of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 have to offer ? @entity18 he ’s a very astute and clever player , aware of what ’s going on around him in midfield and around the penalty box			1
his movement and technical ability are good			2
@entity18 looks to go in behind the defender and to face up and receive the ball			1
he has a bit of pace as well			0
here is a player who will really flourish if he ends up at @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35 because of the amount of chances he ’ll the get there			0
he has a big future			0
@entity40 striker @entity18 ( right ) is a a very astute and clever player with a bit of pace as well @entity19 what people do n’t appreciate about @entity19 is that he ’s scored 15 goals this season yet because @entity46 are fighting relegation , he ’s not had that many chances			1
he is a born finisher , instinctive in the way that @entity51 or @entity52 was and perhaps the best of the three in that regard			0
i was with him at @entity46 and @entity19 knows he has to work on his game outside the box , in his positioning and movement			1
but he will do that , because he is committed learner and though he ’s 25 , you can see him improving over the next few years			0
@entity46 forward @entity19 has scored 15 @entity64 goals this season , despite the club 's struggles @entity20 @entity20 ’s probably not quite as good a finisher as @entity19 , but his all - round game is better			1
he can play off the front , he can play the one right up the top			0
his movement is excellent and technically he looks a really good player			0
his finishing is much more clinical now and he has range , from the header he scored against @entity34 , to shots outside and inside the box			0
in general , if a player is good enough for the senior squad , i do n’t see the sense in sending them back to the @entity84			2
it ’s unlikely @entity20 will get much game time against @entity5 and @entity7 so he will probably go back to the @entity87 for the summer tournament			1
but once he has three or four senior games under his belt , there should be no going back			0
@entity20 is the @entity64 's form man - winning the january and february @entity94 award verdict i do n’t think @entity2 have had this amount of players to choose from up front since i was manager			1
@entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 meant the likes of as @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 were n’t first choice			0
@entity0 might have a similar scenario developing now			2
@entity102 ( left ) was one of several attacking options @entity110 had at his disposal as @entity2 boss			1

@entity2 name their squad for matches vs @entity7 and @entity5 on thursday
@entity2 boss @entity0 has a *wealth* of attacking options to pick
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 could all earn a call - up
