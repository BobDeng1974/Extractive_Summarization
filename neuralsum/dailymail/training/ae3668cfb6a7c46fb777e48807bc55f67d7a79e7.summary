@entity3 ' double on his home ground led @entity4 to an impressive 3 - 1 win over @entity6 at @entity7			1
the @entity9 striker scored in the sixth minute and then again in the second half , while @entity11 also got on the scoresheet for @entity4			1
relive all the action as it happened below			0
host commentator a very good night at the office for @entity4 and they head to @entity16 for their next game on monday night			1
that 's all from me ... see you soon ! a job very well done by @entity4			1
they have played some really good football and scored three quality goals			0
it 's a morale boosting win against the team who they will face in their @entity31 opener in @entity32 in june			2
@entity6 played some good football as well , but their defending let them down			2
but also they look to be holding back a bit and not revealing their hand to @entity4 with that game in june to come			1
@entity4 have now won 11 in a row and will head to @entity16 for a friendly in @entity40 on monday after inflicting @entity6 's first defeat in 15			1
three added minutes at @entity7			2
@entity42 is announced as man of the match with two minutes to play plus injury time			0
it was a close call between him and @entity3 , who scored twice			1
i probably would have given it to @entity42 as well			0
not long left now and there 's a party atmosphere in the crowd			0
a standing ovation for @entity3 as he is replaced with 11 minutes to play			2
the night could n't have gone much better for him - two goals on home soil			2
@entity55 is the man to replace him while @entity56 also comes on for @entity57			0
@entity4 almost home here , but need to keep their concentration			1
a good night 's work for @entity42 comes to an end as he is replaced by @entity62 with 18 minutes to play			0
@entity42 has been a problem for @entity6 's defence all night			1
20 minutes to go in @entity9 and @entity6 are the team on the front foot now			2
@entity4 are defending very deep and allowing their visitors to apply pressure			2
so far , though , @entity70 's side are holding firm and still maintaining a threat on the counter attack			0
@entity3 was clean through a minute ago with a chance for his hat - trick ... but he was also yards offside			1
a number of changes for @entity6			2
@entity78 came on for @entity79 for @entity4 as well			2
two - goal cushion restored for @entity4			1
once again @entity6 were opened up very easily			2
@entity42 did very down the left as he beat his defender and cut the ball back low for @entity3 to slot in from close range			1
@entity4 have had to do some defending at the start of the second half , but that goal should settle them			1
@entity6 must have had a message at half - time to start pushing on and having a go at @entity4			1
in the first half they were timid in possession and often just went from side to side			0
in eight minutes of second - half action they have already tested @entity4 more than they did in the entire first half			1
@entity4 need to be a bit more cautious at the back , but there are still plenty of opportunities going forward , especially on the counter attack			1
game on again in @entity9			0
lovely finish from @entity107 through the legs of @entity109 and @entity6 are back in it			1
@entity4 look to have been caught cold there after the restart , and suddenly their lead is not so comfortable now			1
45 minutes to got then and we 're underway in the second half			0
' more of the same please ' would have been the message from @entity70 in the dressing room at half - time			1
half - time in @entity9 and it 's looking good for @entity4 at the moment			1
they have scored two really good goals and looked very dangerous in possession			0
@entity6 , for all their possession , never really threatened @entity4 and have also struggled to contain the likes of @entity3 , @entity124 and @entity125			1
i 'll be back for the second half very shortly , but here 's @entity129 's views on the action so far : ' this is a big night for some of these @entity4 players			1
@entity70 has a rough idea of what his 23 - man party for the @entity32 will be and a few of this group need to stake a claim			0
one man who is doing so is @entity125			2
he has been heavily involved and is taking the chance to impress the head coach			0
will @entity79 , too , has built on his outstanding performance in @entity144			0
so far it is a case of a job being very well done			0
' no 2 for @entity4 ! again it was lovely , intricate build - up play and @entity79 ' cut back from the left channel went all the way through to @entity11 , who arrived into the penalty box late and slotted in @entity4 's second			1
an excellent finish from the young @entity155 right back and @entity4 double their advantage			2
@entity79 has the ball in the back of the net , but was offside from @entity3 ' ball through			2
no arguments there , the @entity162 man was a couple of yards off			0
much better football from @entity4 over the last few minutes			0
they have been the team taking the game to the opposition and looking menacing			0
@entity6 had a lot of possession earlier but never really troubled @entity4 , but on the other hand @entity4 look dangerous whenever they come forward			1
five minutes until half - time			1
@entity6 are dominating possession at the moment and moving the ball around really well , but without testing the @entity4 back line			1
@entity4 's pacy attacking players like @entity125 and @entity42 are being given plenty of space to work with due to the pattern of the game			1
@entity6 's midfield are very narrow when they defend and there are some gaps for @entity4 to exploit			1
33 minutes played - 1 - 0 to @entity4			2
@entity57 has gotten forward from left back a couple of times and put in some dangerous crosses , the latest of which was spilled by @entity6 goalkeeper @entity107			1
pace of the game has slowed down somewhat			0
@entity4 are having to work very hard without possession as @entity6 are becoming more and more comfortable in possession			1
20 minutes gone at @entity7 and signs that @entity6 are starting to settle into the game now			1
they 've had some possession in midfield and come forward well once or twice			0
@entity197 just had a go from 20 yards , but dragged his shot wide of the far post			0
@entity201 's @entity129 is wrapped up warm in position at @entity7			2
here is an update from him ... ' @entity7 felt different in the minutes before kick - off as the usual soundtrack , which features @entity207 , the @entity208 and @entity209 , was replaced by some atmospheric music			2
some things here remain the same and that is @entity3 scoring in front of the @entity215			0
@entity3 has had to play second fiddle to @entity217 and @entity218 in the qualification programme but he is taking this opportunity to show @entity70 why he should go to the @entity32 next summer			0
' @entity4 once again carved right through @entity6 and the visitors were lucky that the offside flag went up against @entity125 after @entity42 played him through			1
@entity4 's wide players having a lot of joy at the moment and @entity6 need to weather this storm			1
@entity4 look full of pace and creativity every time they come forward			2
@entity6 are being pushed back very deep at the moment and ca n't get a foot on the ball			2
impressive opening 10 minutes from @entity70 's side			0
@entity3 ! @entity4 take the lead ! perfect start for @entity70 's side in @entity9 and it 's local boy @entity3 who opens the scoring in just the sixth minute			1
@entity125 did very well in the right channel to stay onside and then pick out @entity3 with a low cross			1
the @entity9 striker did the rest with a clinical finish from six yards to give @entity4 the lead			1
just rewards for a fast start			0
a purposeful run from @entity3 through the centre gets his home @entity9 crowd excited			2
the striker laid the ball out to the right and then just could n't get on the end of the return cross into the box			0
national anthems done and dusted at @entity7			0
@entity9 's own striker @entity3 in particular looks raring to go			2
@entity6 kick us off and we 're underway			0
these two teams will meet in their opening group b fixture at the @entity266 finals in @entity32 next summer			0
alongside these two will be @entity268 and @entity269 while @entity270 is made up of hosts @entity32 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274			0
@entity70 just told @entity275 that ' the hard work starts now '			0
in @entity278 , they certainly will have their work cut out			0
this team won all 10 of their qualification matches , including both legs of the play - off against @entity284 in a 7 - 4 aggregate win			0
