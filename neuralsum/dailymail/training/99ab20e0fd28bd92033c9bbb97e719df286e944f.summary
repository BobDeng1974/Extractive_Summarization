@entity1 's height has caused her tv character no end of trouble – even earning her the nickname @entity4			0
but one disgruntled viewer has complained to the @entity6 that miss @entity1 's sitcom ridicules tall women ... despite the fact that it is written by its 6ft star			1
the bizarre comment was revealed by the @entity12 in a report containing some of the oddest complaints it received last year			2
the @entity6 has been accused of showing bias against tall women - such as six - foot tall @entity1 - and promoting a ' gay agenda ' one complaint to the @entity6 accused the corporation of unfairly ridiculing tall women in its programmes agenda ? three complaints were made against @entity23 show @entity24 , accusing it of ' promoting homosexuality ' three concerned the family favourite @entity24 , accusing it of ' promoting homosexuality '			1
@entity30 's doctor and his assistant , played by @entity32 , are occasionally joined on their adventures by a lesbian lizard - woman , @entity36 , and her human wife @entity37			0
others were concerned by the lack of happy marriages in other @entity6 dramas , while @entity42 , poor grammar and the use of metric instead of imperial measurements also raised the audience 's ire			0
the return of @entity50 to @entity51 , six years after the @entity53 affair , prompted ten complaints – while on @entity56 , @entity55 was deemed too ' unrealistic '			0
even @entity57 was condemned , for an inappropriate use of the @entity59 , while the stars of @entity61 in @entity62 were castigated for taking their eyes off the road while driving			0
some perceived ' religious bias ' in @entity6 sports coverage which showed footballers crossing themselves			0
others took issue with @entity72 's alleged preferential treatment of @entity73 – with the programme also accused of being @entity75			1
a ' lesbian ' encounter between a lizard and a woman in @entity24 was broadcast earlier this year misery : popular soap @entity79 was in the firing line by viewers who complained about it having ' man - eating characters ' @entity86 should not have called an entrepreneur a ' numpty ' on @entity89 , one complainant said a further complaint was lodged against the show by a viewer who thought it should not have aired footage of a supporter falling over			1
concerning strong language , one @entity89 fan was moved to write in after @entity86 mocked an entrepreneur – by calling him a ' numpty '			2
of the 13,688 complaints made to the @entity6 between last february and this september , 12,000 were serious enough to go through a formal internal process – but hundreds were dismissed at an early stage			1
the trust said this occurred when there was a lack of evidence – or the complaint in question was deemed too trivial			0
a @entity6 spokesman said : ' the complaints framework that the @entity12 put in place in 2012 allows the @entity6 to close down , after an initial response , complaints that for example are hypothetical , use abusive language , fail to cite any evidence or breaches of the @entity6 's editorial guidelines			1
' only about 10 per cent of complaints fall into this category and if complainants are unhappy they can appeal to the @entity12			2

*furious* @entity6 viewers complained about @entity24 having a ' gay agenda '
other complaints said the comedy show @entity131 ridiculed tall women
*licence* *fee* *payers* were also frustrated by @entity79 and the @entity57
@entity72 is ' biased towards @entity73 and @entity75 '
the word ' numpty ' should not be used on @entity89 , one viewer says
*details* of complaints were revealed following a @entity12 *investigation*
more than 13,000 complaints were made to the @entity6 in *18* *months*
