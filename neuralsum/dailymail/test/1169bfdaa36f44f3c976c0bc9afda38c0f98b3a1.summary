dame @entity0 , national director of commissioning operations for @entity2 , was accused of gagging a whistleblower who tried to warn about the impact of targets on ordinary patients			1
she was investigated by the @entity23 , which concluded that there was no case to answer			1
however , it is now reviewing part of this decision and is appointing an independent expert to consider if the original investigation went ‘ far enough ’ in respect of patient safety			1
the @entity23 is concerned that there ‘ may have been a material flaw ’ in the previous decision , which could lead to the case being reopened			1
@entity37 , 57 , a former @entity38 who worked alongside sir @entity40 when he was @entity2 chief , was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower @entity42 while she was in charge of @entity44			1
mr @entity42 and other senior executives at the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) claim that they had raised concerns with her that the enforcement of targets – implemented by the last @entity53 government – was endangering lives			2
this , they alleged , contributed to the trust being in the bottom 25 of the @entity59 ’s mortality league tables and being compared to the scandal - hit @entity60			0
they took their allegations to the @entity23 , the regulatory body for doctors , who investigated but concluded that there was no case to answer			2
but following complaints to the watchdog about its review , it is calling for an independent report			0
the @entity23 said the absence of such a report ‘ may amount to a material flaw in the investigation ’ that may have affected the decision			2

dame @entity37 , 57 , a former gp , was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower @entity42 ( above ) , who tried to warn about the impact of targets , while she was in charge of @entity44 it added : ‘ the specific question here is whether dr @entity0 ’s fitness to practise could be called into question on the basis of her insistence that @entity47 met the @entity2 targets no matter what			1
further evidence from an external independent expert would have been useful to consider whether dr @entity0 ’s actions were reasonable in all of the circumstances			0

mr @entity42 said yesterday : ‘ i am delighted the @entity23 is now considering that when dr @entity0 put pressure on me and my colleagues to hit targets it may have put the lives of patients at risk			1
‘ the @entity2 tried to gag me and prevent me from giving evidence to the @entity23 but what really happened is finally being exposed			0
‘ i hope now the @entity23 will do the right thing and seek to remove dr @entity0 ’s licence			0
’ a @entity23 spokesman said it was ‘ reviewing a decision made as part of our original investigation ’ but added that @entity37 was not under investigation			2
@entity53 insisted that it was ‘ always clear that @entity2 targets should not be implemented in a way that jeopardises the quality of patient care ’ .			0
