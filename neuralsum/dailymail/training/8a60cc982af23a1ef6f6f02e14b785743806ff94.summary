by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 12:53 est , 27 december 2012 over-running engineering work , signal failures and packed trains have been heaping misery on rail passengers today as they returned to work after the @entity8 break			2
a train at @entity10 , @entity11 , was so full some passengers were ordered off before it could continue			1
at some other stations trains were so packed that passengers could not board , with some lucky enough to have got on earlier forced to sit in the aisles			0
misery : passengers were left looking at information boards in hope at @entity21 today the late - running engineering work meant that the @entity23 was not able to run until late morning , and when it did start there were delays to the service			1
the @entity23 issue was due to a power supply problem at @entity29 in @entity30 which meant delays to the finish of engineering work and no services - to start with - between @entity21 station in @entity21 and @entity36 in @entity30			1
there were a number of other problems as well			0
a late finish to platform work at @entity42 in south east @entity21 also caused delays to @entity21 - bound commuters this morning			1
in the @entity47 , a freight train derailment at @entity46 meant trains were unable to call at that station , with buses replacing trains between @entity52 and @entity46			1
the derailment also led to delays to services between @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
in @entity61 a broken - down train at @entity60 meant no trains were able to run between @entity60 and @entity63 , while @entity64 reported delays between @entity66 and @entity67 due to signalling problems			1
@entity70 services in the @entity72 area were also delayed today , with the company saying there were limited platforms available at @entity76 after engineering work			2
later , a signalling problem near @entity79 in @entity80 led to delays to @entity70 and @entity83 ' services between @entity21 and @entity79			1
@entity70 passengers also had to put up with a broken - down train at @entity86 which led to a suspension of services between @entity86 and @entity89			1
there were also delays to services between @entity92 and @entity93 due to late - running engineering work			2
welcome back : overcrowded greeted commuters returning to work today ( library image ) more late - running engineering work at @entity99 in @entity100 led to delays of up to 40 minutes			2
elsewhere in @entity61 , buses replaced trains between @entity104 and @entity105 after someone was hit by a train			1
planned engineering work that was due to carry on was affecting services on a number of routes , while the effects of the flooding were still being felt in some areas - particularly the @entity115			0
@entity116 advised passengers not to travel to and from @entity118 and @entity119			0
routes still closed included @entity121 to @entity122 in @entity119 and @entity123 to @entity124 in @entity118			0
the line between @entity123 and @entity126 was also shut and there was only a very limited service running between @entity129 and @entity123			0
in early afternoon , the @entity131 train company said that due to the over-running of engineering work in the @entity135 area of @entity136 that had been expected to finish at 4am tomorrow , it would be running a similar amended timetable tomorrow , as it had today			2
hold - up : the entrance to the platforms at @entity21 was unusually quite because of the delays @entity141 said there had been problems with bridge work being carried out at @entity145			1
before the floods and the late - running engineering work , @entity141 said about half the number of bus replacement services would be needed this year compared with the 2011/12 festive season			0
in recent years , @entity141 's festive season engineering work , and other bank holiday projects , have generally finished on time			0
however , there was severe disruption when work was not completed in time for the big return to work in january 2008			0
this led to @entity141 being fined a record Â£ 14 million by the @entity160			0
the most damaging overrun in the 2007/08 festive season was on the @entity163 - a route where major work is being carried out during this festive period .			0

one train was so full passengers were ordered off before it could continue
@entity23 was not running earlier because of over-running works
power problems also hold up services between @entity36 and @entity21
train derailment in the @entity47 meant services were replaced by buses
works also lead to platform problems at @entity76
a broken - down train brought hold - ups for passengers in @entity61
*railways* in @entity64 suffer delays because of signalling faults
