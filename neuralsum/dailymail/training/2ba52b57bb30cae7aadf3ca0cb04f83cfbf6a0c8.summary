a mother has revealed how 20 doctors dismissed her baby daughter ’s rare cancer as a birthmark - until it grew to the size of a grapefruit			1
@entity7 , 32 , claims she was told there was ' nothing to worry about ' when her baby @entity10 was born with a purple mark on the left - hand side of her face			1
but now the little girl is undergoing chemotherapy after the mark , which was found to be a tumour , trebled in size within a month and covered her left ear			1
@entity10 , who is four months old , is recovering after she lost her ear when medics carried out an operation to remove the growth			1
@entity10 , pictured with parents @entity24 and @entity7 , needed to have her left ear removed but doctors believed the problem was merely a birthmark ms @entity7 , a nurse from @entity29 , @entity30 , said medics told her that the purple mark , which was originally the size of a golf ball , was simply a ' strawberry ' birthmark			1
as the mark began to grow and bleed , she repeatedly took @entity10 back to hospital but she said doctors prescribed only a medication to shrink birthmarks			2
after a series of visits , @entity10 was eventually referred to @entity42 in @entity43 , where tests found she was suffering from an extremely rare sarcoma tumour			1
further results showed the aggressive cancer had spread to her bone marrow , which meant she had to undergo chemotherapy			2
ms @entity7 , a mother of four , said @entity10 faced an uncertain future as the cancer could return			1
' when she was born they ( doctors and nurses ) brought the baby over and said " she has a small lump " , ' ms @entity7 said			2
@entity57 ( left ) said her daughter @entity10 's tumour ( right ) trebled in size within a month , but doctors only prescribed medication for birthmarks ' i thought " that 's not a small lump , it is massive "			1
i was crying , i had never seen anything like it before			0
' it was supposed to be a happy day but it was n’t at all			0
' they tried to reassure us and said it was a strawberry birthmark but it just did not look right			0
' we must have seen 20 doctors and they never questioned the original diagnosis , they just all said " it ’s a birthmark " and told us not to worry			2
' ms @entity7 , who lives with partner @entity24 , 37 , a recruitment consultant , had a 4d scan at 34 weeks into her pregnancy - which showed no abnormalities			1
@entity10 was born by planned @entity84 on march 1 at @entity85 in @entity30 and weighed a healthy 7lb 1oz			1
she was taken for an ultrasound examination an hour after birth , and doctors concluded the mark was only a birthmark			0
@entity10 's mark ruptured when parents @entity24 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) gave her a bath but ms @entity7 insisted on further investigation and @entity10 underwent an @entity95 at @entity96 on march 6			1
she said : ' the doctor was really nonchalant and said " i bet on my life that it is a birthmark , i do n’t want to see you for a year "			0
' we had to chase the results for about two to three weeks			0
luckily , another doctor at the hospital saw them and we were referred to @entity42 for a review			0
' but as the family waited for their april 19 appointment in @entity43 , @entity10 ’s mark began to grow and trebled in size			1
they returned to @entity85 on april 5 and stayed for four days			0
doctors remained insistent that the tumour was a birthmark and prescribed propanolol to shrink it			0
@entity7 is considering legal action over her baby daughter 's care but the mark began to blister and , on april 16 , it ruptured while ms @entity7 and mr @entity24 were giving @entity10 a bath			1
they returned to @entity85 and demanded that @entity10 stay in for observation for the next three days until her appointment			2
on april 19 @entity10 was taken by ambulance to @entity42 , where an ear , nose and throat consultant ordered a biopsy			2
the biopsy was performed a day later			0
on april 24 , @entity10 's parents were given the devastating news that she had cancer and it had spread to her bone marrow			2
the baby underwent a six - hour operation to remove the cancerous cells on april 29 and she began chemotherapy on may 1			1
ms @entity7 , who is considering legal action , said @entity10 had lost an ear and had a large scar on her face			1
doctors have also warned the family that the girl may suffer from speech and language difficulties in the future			0
but ms @entity7 said : ' to consider what she has gone through in such a short space of time , she is amazing , absolutely amazing			0
' she is an absolute pleasure to be around			0
' @entity10 's parents have seen a solicitor and are planning to take legal advice against the hospital			2
a spokesman for @entity85 said : ' we are very concerned to hear the family is unhappy with the care their daughter received , and would urge them to contact us directly so we can discuss these fully and answer any questions they may have			0
' we have a duty to protect our patients ’ confidentiality and it would not be appropriate for us to comment further			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity171 declined to comment .			0
