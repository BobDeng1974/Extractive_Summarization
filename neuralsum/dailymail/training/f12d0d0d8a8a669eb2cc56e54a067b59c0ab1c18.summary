@entity1 would be a ‘ better , stronger country ’ if fewer people moved here from abroad , @entity0 claimed today			1
the prime minister insisted he did not regret his pledge to cut net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ despite latest figures showing it hitting 260,000			1
he vowed to continue to pursue the target , despite admitting there was little he could do to curb numbers from the @entity14 apart from limiting access to benefits			2
@entity0 promised ' no ifs , no buts ' to reduce net migration to the ' tens off thousands ' but latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the @entity1 than left in the year to june , including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the @entity14 mr @entity0 claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue			1
the rise of @entity27 in recent months has been partly fuelled by their warning that @entity1 can not control its borders while in the @entity14			2
before the last election mr @entity0 pledge ' no ifs , no buts ' to reduce net migration to the ' tens off thousands ' during this parliament			1
but latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the @entity1 than left in the year to june , including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the @entity14			1
mr @entity0 admitted his pledge would not be met , but refused to drop it			2
he told @entity39 : ‘ we ’ve made some progress but not as much as i ’d like			0
the prime minister vowed to continue to pursue the ' tens of thousands ' target , despite admitting there was little he could do to curb numbers from the @entity14 apart from limiting access to benefits ‘ in terms of immigration from outside the @entity14 it ’s now down at its lowest level for many years cos we have put a cap on the number of economic migrants that can come from outside the @entity14 to @entity1			1
‘ but inside the @entity14 migration has gone up , partly because we are creating more jobs than the rest of @entity60 put together , and that ’s why i put the toughest possible welfare reforms for foreign migrants coming to @entity1			1
‘ it was a commitment i made which i want to keep			0
’ asked if he regretted making the promise , the prime minister insisted : ‘ no. i believe that we would be a better , stronger country if we had net migration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands			1
‘ the figures are very clear , i have not achieved that			0
i want to keep going until we do achieve that			0
i think it ’s the right thing for our country			0
’ mr @entity0 claimed that by limiting the number of people moving to the @entity1 , public concern about immigration would decline			2
‘ back in the 1980s when we had an open economy , we had migration in the tens of thousands , and do you know what immigration ceased to be for many years a political issue on our country ’ , he said			1
‘ i think the @entity1 public are intensely reasonable about this issue			0
they recognise that immigration is good for the @entity1 , but they feel it has n’t been controlled properly , they want the numbers brought under control			2
‘ and i want to achieve that pledge because it would be good for our country			0
’ senior @entity93 had pushed mr @entity0 to announce a plan to cap the number of people from within the @entity14 able to move to @entity1 , or impose an ‘ emergency break ’ if large numbers moved from countries with economic problems			1

mr @entity0 has promised to renegotiate @entity1 ’s membership of the @entity14 before holding an in - out referendum before the end of 2017			2

mr @entity0 claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue mr @entity0 added : ‘ first of all they wo n’t be able to claim unemployment benefit			1
second of all if they are still here after six months without a job they have to go home			0
‘ third of all if they stay and work they have to contribute to our system for four years before they get work - related welfare benefits			0
‘ and fourth if they keep their families at home in the country from which they come , they can not receive @entity1 child benefit			0
‘ those four changes i think will have a profound and fundamental effect on the numbers coming from the @entity14 countries to @entity1			1
‘ at the same time no immigration policy will work unless we train up @entity1 young people in court schools and apprentice system better than if we also reform			0

prime minister insists he does not regret ' no ifs , no buts , promise in 2010
