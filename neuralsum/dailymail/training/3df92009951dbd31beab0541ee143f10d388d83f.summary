realism has always been paramount in the @entity2 series , and while the inclusion of a user - friendly ' @entity5 ' may not be to everybody 's tastes , the full - fat game has more depth than ever			1
although tempting to write this off as simple update , the glossy menus and cleaner user interface suggest otherwise			0
attention to detail : there are so many variables to manage , however , this is helped through clear and user - friendly menus @entity20 have streamlined the entire experience , making it more efficient than ever before			2
notably , the pop - up menus are a useful addition , and even the loading screens are packed with information regarding fixtures and news			2
there has also been an overhaul in the match - day experience			2
menus are cleaner , while information about players ' conditions and their ratings appears between highlights			2
your assistant manager provides you with match intel through a specific data feed , and in - game commands are now much more simple to execute			1
interestingly , the press conference system now allows you to respond to questions in a variety of tones - however , there are only a limited amount of generic answers , so this may start to grate after a while			0
the training mode has had a complete overhaul , too , offering an extra layer of depth			1
all of these aspects can be assigned to an assistant manager , though , if they become too overwhelming			0
thankfully , if management of countless variables is too daunting a task , then @entity5 offers nearly all of the same thrills at a fraction of the stress			0
wonder strike : the match - day interface has been overhauled - making it more efficient and easier to tell what is going on indeed , the mode captures a sense of fun and accessibility not often associated with the series			1
there 's still enough depth there to please hardcore fans , but with a much - needed hint of arcade , pick - up - and - play gameplay			1
another great addition is the @entity82 , which is essentially crisis management			0
here you are given a team facing a dilemma - for example , on the brink of relegation - and have to steer them through to calmer waters			0
looks can be deceiving : football manager 2013 is not just a simple update again , @entity20 have made the experience as user - friendly as possible			0
success or failure is determined within hours , not weeks , making it a perfect companion on a rainy afternoon			0
to stop things getting stale , there are plenty of achievements to be unlocked and an in - game store			1
online multiplayer is playable through steam , where you can challenge other @entity91 fans from around the world , with leaderboards showing how you compare			1
there is no doubt that this is the most detailed and well - rounded football management game ever created			1
but it 's the brilliant @entity5 that is the star of the show - turning fm into an instantly playable game and less of a relationship - ending hobby			2
follow @entity116 on @entity117 : @ @entity118 and on @entity119 : @entity120 .			0

the most in - depth and thorough @entity91 game yet
*classic* mode is wonderful , adding a much - needed pick - up - and - play element to proceedings
challenge mode allows you to compete with other players online
