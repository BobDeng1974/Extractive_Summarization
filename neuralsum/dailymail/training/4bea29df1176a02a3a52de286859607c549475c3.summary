by @entity1 reporter published : 15:19 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 17 may 2013 the constant distractions that people now face from emails , texts and social media is ruining our ability to complete tasks as efficiently as we used to and is making us dumber claims a new survey			2
the study from @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity12 analyzed the impact that juggling modern communications has on someone 's brain while their working			1
their experiment included 136 subjects , who were asked to read a short passage and then answer questions about it			0
the constant distractions that people now face from emails , texts and social media is ruining our ability to complete tasks as efficiently as we used to and is making us dumber the test subjects were divided into three groups called control , interrupted and @entity33 , reports @entity34			1
for the first test , the control group was allowed to complete it without interruption , while the other two groups were told before they started that they ‘ might be contacted for further instructions ’ at any moment via instant message			2
during the test both groups were interrupted twice			2
then a second test was carried out			0
this time only the second group was interrupted , while the third group waited for an interruption that never came			0
the researchers expected the @entity50 and @entity52 groups to make some mistakes during the first test , but were shocked when both groups answered correctly 20 percent less often than members of the @entity35			0
test results suggest that digital multitasking does have an impact on people 's performance at work , but it may be possible for people to train themselves to cope better with distractions during the second experiment the @entity50 group underperformed the @entity35 , but closed the gap significantly , down to 14 percent			1
according to @entity14 psychologist @entity69 this suggests that people who experience an interruption , and expect another , can learn to improve how they deal with it			1
the surprising finding was that the @entity52 group , those warned of an interruption that never came , improved by a massive 43 percent and even outperformed the control test takers who had been left alone			0
dr. @entity69 believes this shows that the @entity50 group learned from their experience in the first test and their brains adapted			0
the subjects in the @entity65 were able to marshal the extra brain power to prepare themselves to be interrupted and that helped them to focus more on what they were doing			1
so while the results suggest that digital multitasking does have an impact on people 's performance at work , it may be possible for people to train themselves to cope better with distractions , even if they do n’t know when they 're about to hit .			1

tests have shown that people perform worse when interrupted by modern communications such as instant *messenger* at work
the research by @entity14 also found that the brain can adapt if it is prepared for the interruptions
