encased within a plastic isolation chamber , @entity1 missionary @entity0 lands on home soil after being struck down with @entity4 while helping victims in @entity6			1
the priest , a medical director of the @entity8 , was infected with the deadly disease as he tended to victims in the @entity11 city of @entity12			0
and today , dramatic images of the missionary being unloaded from a @entity1 military transport plane at @entity15 in @entity16 were released , laying bare how fearful even the most experienced of medical professionals are of the disease			1
in scenes that would not feel out of place in a science - fiction movie set in space , mr @entity0 was wheeled by doctors dressed from head to toe in protective bio-hazard suits to a @entity16 hospital where they will battle to save his life			1
these dramatic images lay bare quite how fearful even the most experienced of medical professionals are of the disease he is the second @entity1 priest to be diagnosed with @entity4 after @entity40 , also a member of @entity41 , died last month days after being brought back to @entity1 from @entity42			1
meanwhile , @entity6 's controversial @entity4 lockdown has uncovered some 150 new cases of the deadly virus in addition to around 70 bodies previously unaccounted for , according to the authorities , who said they may repeat the campaign			1
most of the west @entity65 country 's six million people were confined to their homes for 72 hours from friday , as 30,000 volunteers went from door to door to educate residents on preventing the spread of the deadly epidemic			1
the crack down came as it emerged many families in the country are conducting secret ' night burials ' of victims - clandestine funeral services held under cover of darkness to conceal the fact that there had been an @entity4 patient in the household			1
precautions : a suspected victim of @entity4 shields his face as @entity42 nurses spray him with disinfectant at the entrance of @entity91 treatment centre in @entity92 the country 's controversial @entity4 lockdown has uncovered some 150 new cases of the deadly virus in addition to around 70 bodies previously unaccounted for not only is that making it increasingly difficult for authorities to record an accurate death toll for the the worst outbreak of the disease on record , but it is also seriously damaging @entity6 's ability to prevent its spread			1
the @entity103 says the virus has already killed more than 562 people in the country			0
' we have an overflow of bodies which we still need to bury but this has been an everyday occurrence since the @entity4 outbreak ... now at least we have about 150 new cases , ' @entity112 , head of the country 's emergency operation centre , said late last night			2
the country 's chief medical officer earlier said up to 70 bodies had been uncovered , but these were in and around the capital , and results for the whole country are likely to push up the figures significantly			2
health minister @entity124 told @entity126 volunteers had managed to reach around 80 percent of homes , deeming the action a success			0
' we have learnt a lot from the campaign			0
although this campaign has ended , there is a possibility we would have a similar one some other time , ' he said			0
' i can not as of now give you statistics about the total corpses collected during the three - day period as we are now awaiting returns from other parts of the country and this will be made known as soon as the full report is compiled			0
' it comes as it was revealed an official team burying @entity4 victims was attacked in @entity6 's capital on saturday			1
the attack on the burial team on saturday occurred in the village of @entity152 , some three miles from @entity153			0
panic : @entity42 's government says it is desperate to cut down on ' night burials ' - funeral services held within families trying to conceal the fact that there had been an @entity4 patient in the household @entity42 nurses carry a suspected @entity4 patient into the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) ebola treatment center in @entity92 , @entity42			1
local mp @entity166 said that armed policemen accompanying the burial team quickly arrived , causing the attackers to flee			0
but the attack represents the huge challenge faced by governments in the region who are desperately trying to stamp out the disease in the face of widespread fears , misinformation and stigma among residents of the affected countries			0
a day earlier , it emerged eight bodies , including those of three journalists , were found after an attack on a team trying to educate locals on the risks of the ebola virus in a remote part of neighbouring @entity192			2
' the eight bodies were found in the village latrine			0
three of them had their throats slit , ' government spokesman @entity195 said			0
@entity192 's prime minister @entity199 , speaking earlier , said six people were arrested following the incident , which took place on tuesday in @entity203 , a village close to the town of @entity206 , in @entity192 's southeast , where @entity4 was first identified in march			2
@entity4 has infected at least 5,357 people in @entity209 this year , mainly in @entity6 , @entity192 and @entity42 , killing 2,630 of those , according to the @entity103 .			2

@entity0 was flown home aboard a @entity1 military plane
he landed in @entity16 this morning where doctors will battle to save his life
@entity6 's *population* confined at home for 72 hours since friday
30,000 volunteers went door to door to educate on preventing spread
meanwhile it emerged families holding secret ' night burials ' at night
the idea is to conceal fact there had been an @entity4 patient in household
