in the dream scenario @entity1 's final action in a @entity3 shirt will be the lifting of the @entity6 at @entity7 on may 30 , his 35th birthday			1
for more than 16 years @entity1 was @entity11 's beating heart			1
the good times were great			0
he gave them @entity14 , a crazy , glorious night forever etched into the club 's history			2
a year later , in 2006 , it was his last - minute long - range strike that gave them life against @entity21 in @entity22			0
@entity1 returned to @entity3 training earlier this week after almost a month out with injury the club captain led @entity3 to @entity27 glory against @entity28 in 2005 in total there was a @entity27 , a @entity31 , two @entity32 and three @entity33			1
even in the bad times ( and there were plenty as a @entity37 title remained elusive ) the local boy was a source of @entity41 inspiration			1
when @entity46 wobbled and @entity47 came back but could only lead them to eighth , punters in pubs from @entity44 to @entity45 could take solace			0
' at least we 've got @entity1 '			1
from next season , however , they will not			2
they appear to be giant boots to fill			0
imagining a @entity3 without @entity1 is like imagining @entity54 without @entity55			1
but the show must go on and , in @entity57 , @entity58 might just have the ideal replacement			1
a year later @entity1 inspired the @entity60 to an @entity6 win against @entity21 a @entity3 team without @entity1 will be like @entity54 without @entity55 ( front left ) his goalkeeper certainly thinks so			1
after wednesday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity67 @entity66 cast an early vote for may 's @entity11 election			2
' @entity70 is a massive player for us , ' he said			0
' he is a very positive character who always works hard and leads by example			0
' he 's vocal both on the pitch and in the dressing room			2
he goes in front of us and everyone follows behind			0
' can @entity57 lead from the front like @entity1 ? can he carry the team on his back ? some would point to the penalty spat with @entity86 as evidence that the 24 - year - old is not cut out for the job			1
@entity57 has led the team in @entity1 's absence as @entity3 have made a charge for the top four @entity57 has been in inspired form for @entity3 and struck sensational goals in his last two games @entity1 , they say , would never have let the @entity97 take the ball			1
he would have shown him who was boss			0
the man himself said as much			0
but they would be wrong to criticise			0
@entity86 , being @entity86 , was always going to try and take the penalty			0
and why not ? have you seen his record ? out of 29 penalties he has scored 27			0
aside from his unpredictability , scoring from the spot is one of few things consistent about madcap @entity86 and @entity57 , who has never taken a penalty in such a high - stakes environment , will have known that			2
for the good of the team he made the right call not to make a fuss			0
surely that is the mark of a good captain ? @entity1 , a fine skipper , was the master of responding to adversity and @entity57 is no stranger to ramming critics ' barbs back from whence they came			1
since sir @entity126 's trial by autobiography he has written promising new chapters in his @entity3 career			1
against @entity67 he hit a netbuster from distance and then slid to his knees in front of the @entity134			2
sound familiar ? @entity57 celebrates after finding the top corner against @entity136 last weekend in the five games @entity138 has played since @entity1 's absence @entity3 have won all five matches his accent may be more @entity142 than @entity143 but @entity57 is now being talked up as a successor and for good reason			1
there is a growing clamour to hand the armband to the @entity149			0
the midfielder - turned - defender has been impressive since his backwards switch and was first to pick up @entity153 following his penalty miss at @entity155			0
the ' # beast ' is only 21 , however , and his time will come			0
time will be up for @entity159 - bound @entity1 at @entity160 or at @entity7			2
whether it 's in @entity161 or at the @entity162 , @entity3 will bid a painful farewell to their talisman and he will be missed			1
but if @entity1 remained the player that so often dragged his side from the turf @entity58 would not have allowed him to leave and that is worth noting when the inevitable tears are shed at his watershed			1
in the six @entity37 games that @entity1 has missed this season @entity3 have won them all it is easy to get sentimental when it comes to such a figure			1
@entity1 deserves to be remembered as a legend because , in this world where the word is bandied about at the drop of the hat , he is one			2
the fact of the matter , however , is that his impact has lessened considerably in recent times			2
in the @entity37 this season @entity3 have played 22 games with @entity1 in the side			1
they have won nine of those , drawn six and lost seven at an average of 1.3 goals for , 1.3 against and 1.5 points per game			0
without @entity1 they have played six games and won them all with an average of 2.3 goals for to 0.3 goals against			1
maybe those boots are not as big as they used to be .			0

@entity1 is leaving @entity3 in the *summer* to join @entity203
@entity3 's *vice-captain* @entity57 has impressed in recent weeks
@entity57 has led the side with @entity1 out injured during recent run
@entity3 have won nine of their last eleven @entity37 games
@entity1 has missed six @entity37 games this season
@entity214 : @entity57 has hit another level
