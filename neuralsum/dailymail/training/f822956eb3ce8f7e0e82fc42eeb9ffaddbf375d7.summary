by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 13:53 est , 31 january 2013 @entity1 has finally treated the internet users to a tour of the @entity4 ... but it does n't look like the barren and dusty land pictured in postcards			1
instead the eagerly awaited expansion of @entity8 showcases one of the seven wonders of the world as a lush and green expanse with extensive woods			2
the internet search company in october sent staff lugging backpack - mounted @entity8 cameras to capture the views around the trails of the geological scar that carves a swathe across @entity22			0
those images have now been processed , stitched together and turned into panoramic , scrollable images available to view on @entity25			2
the view towards @entity27 : the @entity29 people considered the @entity4 ( ' @entity30 ' in the @entity32 language ) a holy site and made pilgrimages to it			0
outstanding natural beauty : @entity4 impact site : @entity1 has also released a range of panoramas of the trails around nearby @entity40 the collection includes more than 9,500 panoramas taken from the most popular hiking trails along the @entity4 's south rim and nearby @entity40			1
with a click of the mouse , @entity46 users are transported virtually for a 360 - degree view of locales they may have read about only in tourist books and seen in flat , 2d images			2
@entity25 product manager @entity53 said : ' whether you ’re planning an upcoming hike , or want to learn more about the @entity57 ’s geological history , @entity25 can help			0
' today , we ’re releasing panoramic imagery of one of the world ’s most spectacular national monuments : the @entity4			0
' these beautiful , interactive images cover more than 75 miles of trails and surrounding roads , making our map of this area even more comprehensive , accurate and easy to use than ever before ' take a walk down the narrow trails and exposed paths of the @entity4 : hike down the famous @entity71 , gaze out at the mighty @entity72 , and explore scenic overlooks in full 360 - degrees			2
' you ’ll be happy you ’re virtually hiking once you get to the steep inclines of the @entity76			0
the @entity76 : for thousands of years , the @entity4 area has been continuously inhabited by native americans who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves			2
@entity1 's unveiling of its @entity83 marks the publication of pictures taken by its novel @entity87 camera system			1
the backpack - mounted device , pictured right , captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each			2
around the @entity4 , gps data is limited , so @entity1 must compensate with sensors that record temperature , vibrations and the orientation of the device as it changes a removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data gathered			1
images will then be stitched together and made available to users in a few months @entity1 has said it nos wants to deploy them at national forests , the narrow streets of @entity106 , @entity107 and ancient ruins and castles			1
' you ’ve seen our cars , trikes , snowmobiles and trolleys — but wheels only get you so far			0
there ’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot , ' @entity1 said last when it unveiled @entity87 last summer			1
' @entity87 solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the @entity4 so anyone can explore them			1
' all the equipment fits in this one backpack , and we ’ve already taken it out on the slopes			0
' ' and rather than drive a couple hours to see the nearby @entity40 , a click of your mouse or tap of your finger will transport you to the rim of this otherworldly site			1
' a steep - sided natural scar on the @entity22 landscape carved by the @entity72 , the @entity4 is 277 miles long , up to 18 miles wide and , in parts , up to a mile deep			0
it exposes nearly two billion years of the @entity57 's geological history as the river and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock			1
for thousands of years , the area has been continuously inhabited by native americans who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves			2
the @entity29 people considered the @entity4 ( ' @entity30 ' in the @entity32 language ) a holy site and made pilgrimages to it			0
the @entity4 virtual tour is the latest evolution in mapping technology for the company , which has used a rosette of cameras to photograph thousands of cities and towns in dozens of countries for its @entity8 feature			0
@entity1 's cameras already have taken users to narrow cobblestone alleys in @entity168 using a tricycle , inside the @entity170 with a push cart and to @entity173 's snow - covered slopes by snowmobile			1
the project began in 2007 , with five @entity177 cities mapped out with @entity179 cameras mounted on @entity1 's now - famous @entity8 cars			1
since then its cars , now equipped with @entity183 cameras , have driven more than 5million unique miles of road across every continent			0
@entity8 now covers more than 3,000 cities across 45 countries - and even a slice of @entity190 complete with the southern continent 's resident penguins			2
another side revealed : @entity1 's latest offering reveals that it does n't look like the barren land pictured in postcards contradiction : previous images of one of the seven wonders of the world show it as a barren and dry habitat but these images of the @entity4 are the first to be taken by the company 's @entity87 platform , which allows workers on foot to collect 360 degree imagery with a back - pack mounted camera system			1
' our team strapped on the @entity214 - operated 40lb backpacks carrying the 15 - lens camera system and wound along the rocky terrain on foot , enduring temperature swings and a few muscle cramps along the way , ' mr @entity53 said			0
@entity1 's @entity87 cameras capture images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are @entity179 each			1
a removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data as it is gathered			0
gps data around the @entity4 is limited , so @entity1 was forced to compensate with sensors to record temperature , vibrations and the orientation of the device as it changes			1
these details were essential to developers given the job of stitching them back together into seamless , scrollable panoramas			0
hikers that were on the @entity4 trails when the data was gathered have had their faces blurred - an attempt by @entity1 to ensure privacy			1
the company came in for fierce criticism in @entity246 and @entity247 after it emerged that it had scooped up and stored information transmitted over unsecured wireless networks while capturing images for @entity8			0
the @entity4 is just the start of @entity1 's plans for the @entity87 backpacks			1
the company has said it wants to deploy them at national forests , to the narrow streets of @entity106 , @entity107 and to ancient ruins and castles .			0

first official publication of images taken by @entity1 's @entity87 backpacks
features 9,500 panoramas taken around the canyon and @entity40
but canyon looks *surprisingly* lush instead of showing barren rock
