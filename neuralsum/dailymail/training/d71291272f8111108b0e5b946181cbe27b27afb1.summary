for decades , airline pilots were the only people lucky enough to catch sight of an incredible natural phenomenon known as red sprites			1
these rare burst of light last for just a few milliseconds and take place more than 50 miles ( 80 km ) above the ground during a thunderstorm			1
now one photographer has managed to capture this elusive light after spending months on the road following storms in @entity13 , @entity14			1

now one photographer has managed to capture this elusive light after spending months on the road following storms in @entity20 , @entity14 the incredible flashes of light are caused by huge electrical discharges of lightning in the sky , and they get their deep red hue from nitrogen molecules in the air			1
@entity29 , 32 , managed to capture the rare pictures whilst standing in a corn field , over 200 miles ( 320km ) away from the phenomenon			1
mr @entity29 , from @entity33 in @entity34 , said : ' i 've been trying to capture them for few months now			1
' i was very happy with the results , the details of the sprites came out pretty impressively			0

i was very happy with the results , the details of the sprites came out pretty impressively ' '' sprites are not easy to capture , and might occur just a few times in hours , but this storm system was very active this time , ' said mr @entity29			2
the late experimental physicist @entity48 accidentally discovered sprites , while helping to test a new low - light video camera in 1989 the incredible flashes of light are caused by huge electrical discharges of lightning in the sky , and they get their deep red hue from nitrogen molecules in the air			0
pictured is the lightning storm where the sprites were seen red sprites are electrical bursts of light that occur above highly active thunderstorms			1
they can be seen in the @entity66 of the ionosphere			0
this is the area of the atmosphere just above the dense lower atmosphere , about 37 to 56 miles ( 60 km to 90 km ) above the @entity71			2
atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century , but their origins were a mystery			0
they only last a few milliseconds and are relatively dim compared with other lightning			0

' sprites are not easy to capture , and might occur just a few times in hours , but this storm system was very active this time			0
' it was very difficult to get these shots as they are so rare and you simply have to be quite lucky that the storm will produce them			2
' you might take hundreds of photos without capturing any of them , ' added mr @entity29 , who works as a system administrator for highways in @entity34			2
' only the strongest and the most bright ones were visible to the naked eyes , acting like very short flash of light above the storm			0
' i was standing on the open corn fields , i found the spot to have good visuals away from city lights and trees			0
' atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century , but researchers have been baffled as to how , and why , they form			0
in may , @entity106 researchers managed to model the elusive phenomenon , which forms above thunderstorms and appears as a ' jellyfish ' shape in the sky			0
they say they believe that sprites form at plasma irregularities and may be useful in remote sensing of the lower ionosphere â€“ an area that facilitates radio communication on @entity71			0
