by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 06:34 est , 3 september 2012 a border collie with a chronic leg condition that could have meant she would never walk again has been given a new leash of life - after getting a pair of miracle boots			1
@entity8 was devastated when her dog , @entity11 , was diagnosed with severe achilles tendon injuries , and was told it was unlikely she would fully recover			1
but 10 - year - old @entity11 has stunned vets by fighting back , and is even winning agility competitions after specialists designed her a revolutionary pair of splint boots			1
what an athlete ! @entity11 show off her recovery with a stunning jump ms @entity23 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ' we ’re all astounded at @entity11 ’s recovery - in true paralympian style , she ’s back out competing with the best of them			1
' she has always been a really active dog , so it was devastating when we were told she had such terrible tendon injuries			2
' she underwent an operation at @entity35 which realigned the tendons - but they said she would re-injure them if she put any stress on them at all			0
' i knew we would n’t be able to keep her still and was terrified she would re-injure herself			0
' her orthopedic boots are brilliant - she is n’t the least bit bothered about having her legs strapped up , and you would n’t know she was different from any other dog			2
' i was a miracle just to have her walking again , let alone being able to run around competing in agility classes			2
' she 's not going to win crufts , but we can still go out and have fun in the veterans classes every weekend			0
' @entity52 pup : after surgery and before her brilliant boots , the collie 's legs had to be encased in plaster casts @entity58 : the high - tech boots helped @entity11 after her operation , and will now stop her injury recurring agility dog @entity11 had been competing at a high level until she developed problems with her legs in 2009 , making it difficult for her to walk			1
she underwent two operations to correct the ligaments at the @entity69 in 2010 , and got her boots soon after			2
the amazing footwear was the work of @entity73 , who make braces and prosthetics for injured pets			0
@entity78 , who created the boots , said : ' in simple terms , @entity11 had injuries to the @entity82 in both hocks , which were fraying			1
' both required surgical repair , during which the damaged sections were effectively cut out and the " good " ends sutured back together			0
' after this type of surgical procedure the hock needs to be immobilised for several weeks to allow the tendon to heal , which is normally achieved by pinning the joint			0
typically , when the pin is removed the joint will be put into a hard cast for a further few weeks			0
stunning recovery : owner @entity8 poses with her border collie , @entity11 , whose life was transformed by her splint boots not bad for a 10 - year - old ! @entity11 's new boots mean she can keep up her agility skills ' the problem is that at some stage the joint will go from a fully immobilised state to a free - moving state and at that point there is nothing to stop the dog over-flexing the joint and re-injuring the newly repaired tendon			1
' dogs do n’t understand bed rest or being careful			0
this problem is compounded if the dog is particularly fit , active and energetic - such as an agility @entity119 ! ' the orthotics that we made for @entity11 have served two functions			1
' during the healing and rehabilitation phase , they allowed the amount of movement at the hocks to be controlled and progressively increased in line with how the tendons were healing , instead of the conventional all - or - nothing approach			0
' then , on an ongoing basis , they prevent over-flexion and the subsequent risk of re-injury to the tendons , especially during periods of high activity - such as agility			2
' we are thrilled that we ’ve been able to help her continue with a healthy and active lifestyle			0
' raring to go : thanks to her orthotics , nothing stands between @entity11 and a happy , active life			1

revolutionary orthotic boots mean agility champ @entity11 will keep her winning form
