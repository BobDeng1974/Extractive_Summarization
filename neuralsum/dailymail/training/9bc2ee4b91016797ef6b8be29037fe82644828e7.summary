@entity0 was accused of ‘ total cynicism ’ last night after he made two sharply contrasting speeches on immigration and race equality in just seven hours			1
during a visit to @entity8 on thursday , where @entity9 is tipped for a by - election victory next month on an anti-immigration platform , the @entity6 leader pledged to crack down on immigration if he wins power next year			1
but at a meeting with ethnic minority activists in @entity15 , @entity16 , a few hours later , he pledged a crackdown on race inequality and consider ‘ all - black shortlists ’ to recruit more ethnic @entity20			1
contrast : extracts from @entity0 's two speeches today portray a very different message from the @entity6 leader in @entity8 he made no mention of race equality ; in @entity15 he made no mention of curbing immigration			1
this comes just weeks after @entity0 was lampooned for forgetting to mention the budget deficit in his speech to the @entity6 conference			2
last night , @entity34 mp @entity33 said : ‘ no one will object to cracking down on racial inequality			0
but it is totally cynical to say one thing to one audience and something else a few hours later to another			0
the message should have been consistent			0
’ mr @entity0 used his trip to @entity8 to unveil a tough new stance on immigration , saying : ‘ if i become prime minister i will bring in clear , credible and concrete measures to count all people going in and out of the @entity49			1
’ he would stop child benefit and tax credits being paid for children who live abroad , curb immigrants ’ benefits , ban bosses using immigrant labour to undercut @entity49 workers and make sure more public sector workers can speak @entity59			0
’ but he did not mention immigration when he addressed the @entity62 meeting in @entity15 which included many @entity6 supporters			1
he said if he became @entity46 , one of his first acts would be to introduce new laws to promote racial equality			0
warning : the @entity6 leader was told he faces a ‘ catastrophic ’ blow to his hopes of power after the resignation of his @entity73 counterpart @entity72 ‘ i ’m committing today , in front of you as my witnesses , to saying that if a @entity6 government is elected to power we will deliver a race equality strategy across every government department within a year			1
' we would tackle police stop and search , which is disproportionately used on black people ... and tackle the under - representation of black people in the judiciary and in public sector board rooms			0
’ he said @entity6 wanted more ethnic minority @entity91 mandarins , judges and company directors and would ‘ guarantee ’ jobs for unemployed black youngsters in @entity16			2
‘ it is shocking that 44 per cent of black young people in @entity16 are without a job			0
we are going to guarantee them a job ... you can hold me to that promise , after the @entity105 , unlike other politicians			0
’ pressed by activists at the meeting to back ‘ all - black shortlists ’ to recruit more ethnic @entity20 modelled on ‘ all - women shortlists ’ , he said @entity6 ‘ should debate the issue ’			2
a @entity6 spokesman last night said it was ‘ ridiculous ’ to suggest mr @entity0 had been inconsistent .			2

leader pledges to crack down immigration in @entity9 *stronghold* of @entity8
but *highlights* problem of ' race inequality ' in @entity15 just hours later
two contrasting speeches *appeared* completely tailored to his audience
the @entity6 leader was warned he faces a ‘ catastrophic ’ blow to his hopes of power after the resignation of his @entity73 counterpart @entity72 . @entity131 , *ex-labour* @entity73 first minister , said : ‘ if there ’s any hiccup in the number of *mps* we send to @entity139 in 2015 , it could be catastrophic for @entity0 ’s *efforts* to become prime minister . ’ ms @entity142 quit *yesterday* , accusing @entity143 of treating the @entity73 party like a ‘ *branch* office ’ . the move *quickly* led to calls for @entity148 to return to *frontline* politics and lead @entity6 .
