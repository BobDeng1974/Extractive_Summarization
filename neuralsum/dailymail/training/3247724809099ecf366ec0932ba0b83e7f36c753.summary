a furious judge @entity15 sent jurors out of the courtroom before grilling prosecutor @entity18 for allowing a witness to mention a bullet and leave the impression that @entity2 left it in the witness ' driveway			1
@entity15 then took a recess to allow defense attorneys to file a motion for mistrial			1
' it ca n't be reckless , it is intentional , ' @entity2 attorney @entity27 told the judge when court reconvened , arguing that prosecutors violated court orders			2
the former cop was charged in the 2004 death of his third wife , @entity5 , after his fourth wife , @entity36 , went missing in 2007			1
@entity2 is suspected in her disappearance but has n't been charged			2
@entity38 said prosecutors did n't deliberately try to get the witness , former @entity2 neighbor @entity40 , to mention that he found the .38 - caliber bullet on his driveway			0
the judge appeared close to declaring a mistrial yesterday after a prosecutor began to discuss an allegation that @entity2 once tried to hire a hit man			1
prosecutors contend @entity2 killed @entity48 and tried to make it look like an accident			0
defense attorney @entity51 told jurors repeatedly during his opening statement that there was no evidence @entity48 's death was anything but a tragic accident			1
it appears the drama surroundnig @entity2 's life and his arrest is due to continue in the courtroom			0

sketch : @entity2 , left , looks on as defense attorney @entity73 cross examines @entity5 's neighbor , @entity74 , as they view a photo of @entity48 's lifeless body in the tub of her home yesterday : attorneys for @entity2 , from left , @entity73 , @entity81 , and @entity51 listen as @entity82 , a friend and spokesperson for the family of @entity36 address the media during a recess in court prosecutors : will @entity90 state 's attorney @entity89 told the court during opening statements that @entity2 killed his wife and made it look like an accident will @entity90 state 's attorney @entity89 told jurors that @entity2 , 58 , killed @entity48 , 40 , and made it look like an accident			1
' just weeks before her death , he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension , ' @entity89 said during opening statements			0
@entity2 's real - life drama inspired a tv movie and a national spotlight was put on the case , as many speculated whether @entity2 used his law - enforcement expertise to get away with @entity48 's murder and make 23 - year - old @entity36 vanish			1
grave charges : @entity2 is accused of murdering @entity5 , left			2
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity5 , the third wife of @entity2 , at the @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 the first witness in the trial - @entity48 's close friend and next - door neighbor @entity74 - was called yesterday			1
she cried as she was shown a picture of @entity48 lying lifeless in her bathtub before describing the moment she found her body in march 2004			0
mrs @entity74 told the court she and her husband @entity136 , their son @entity134 and another neighbor , @entity135 , entered the home late in the evening after @entity2 told her he could not get in touch with his @entity139 recalled : ' i went into the bathroom , seen @entity5 in the tub and i ran out of the bathroom and threw myself on the floor and started screaming			2
' @entity2 checked @entity48 's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied : ' yes @entity74 , she is			0
' she said she noticed dried blood in @entity48 's hair and blood coming from her mouth , and she had bruises on her wrists and buttocks			0
mrs @entity74 said she offered to cover @entity48 with a towel ' because i did n't want people to see her like that			0
but he ( @entity2 ) said we were n't supposed to touch anything and we could n't do that			0
' the prosecution is expected to try and use statements that @entity36 made to her minister before she vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing @entity48			2
while hearsay is usually barred , if the judge admits @entity36 ’s statements , the testimony could be damaging to @entity2 , according to @entity170 , a @entity171 attorney who has been following the case			1
distress : @entity176 and @entity48 , parents of @entity2 's third wife @entity5 , return to court as he stands trial for her murder ‘ what the judge is going to do is he 's going to wait and make individual rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay , not give a blanket ruling , but listen to see if they open the door in some way that makes the hearsay admissible			1
he 'll make this a day by day ruling on these different pieces , ’ @entity170 told @entity180			0
‘ essentially we 've got @entity2 confessing the murder of @entity48 to his fourth wife , but we still have the question of whether that will come in			1
’ prosecutors will also try to admit @entity36 's statements to her minister that she saw @entity2 arrive home with women 's clothing around the time of @entity48 's death			1
@entity48 's sister may take the stand to describe @entity48 's statements that @entity2 threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like an accident			0
missing : @entity2 , right , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity36 , right taken in : police lt. @entity213 , left , and a fellow investigator escort @entity2 , centre , into @entity215 state police headquarters in 2009 ‘ that does n't concern us , ’ @entity2 's attorney , @entity51 told @entity180 this week			1
‘ anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of character , and clearly @entity229 was trying to build a case to try and get as much money as she could			0
’ the outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the seven men and five women on the jury will believe : @entity238 or @entity239			0
@entity238 , who investigated @entity48 ’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall , died earlier this year			2
the defense will likely call expert witnesses to testify that the woman ’s death was accidental			2
@entity239 , who investigated @entity48 's body after it was exhumed in 2007 , will testify for the prosecution at the trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental fall to homicidal drowning			2
‘ first , they are not going to be able to say that ( the death investigation was botched ) because it was n't , ’ @entity2 's attorney said			0
‘ by saying that if they had done a better job in the investigation , then they would have been able to prosecute @entity2 , that lowers the burden of proof			0
where you do n't have evidence , you presume innocence			0
