@entity1 prop @entity0 will miss @entity3 's autumn test series after rupturing a tendon in his upper arm in training with @entity8 's squad			1
the @entity10 - born tighthead faces surgery next week and could now be sidelined for as long as four months			0
the 33 - year - old was lined up for his international debut against @entity14 next weekend			0
his absence further drains @entity3 's already stretched front - row resources			0
@entity1 prop @entity0 will be out of @entity3 's autumn internationals after suffering an arm injury the former @entity20 front - rower had been expected to understudy @entity21 across the autumn series , with @entity23 already out for three months after shoulder surgery			1
now head coach @entity8 and @entity3 will be pinning hopes on @entity20 's experienced front - rower @entity21 recovering from groin trouble as expected to shore up @entity3 's scrum			1
@entity20 's 34 - year - old scrum cornerstone @entity21 is expected to return to full training next week			0
with @entity0 the latest star to lengthen @entity3 's injury glut , his return gains even greater importance			2
the big - scrummaging @entity35 would have looked to take on @entity3 's set - piece even if the @entity38 hosts were at full strength up front next weekend			2
@entity0 's absence , allied to @entity23 's shoulder surgery , leaves @entity3 short of experience at tighthead for the @entity35 clash			1
@entity0 could be out of action for four months as he is due for surgery on a ruptured tendon in his arm @entity8 had admitted he promoted @entity0 into the squad for his potential debut on the strength of his lengthy top - level club career , expecting the 33 - year - old to handle @entity56 intensity better than several promising but young and raw prospects			2
now the former @entity20 coach must draw on @entity1 's versatile front - rower @entity59 and @entity62 's @entity61 as potential understudies to @entity21			0
former schoolteacher @entity8 should at least be able to call on @entity64 at loosehead prop as he aims to step up his return from injury , offsetting somewhat @entity69 's long - term absence			0
@entity3 will still be shorn of at least 15 stars for the visit of @entity72 's @entity35 , however , before entertaining @entity73 and then @entity74 across the three - test @entity76 series .			1

@entity0 was set for @entity3 debut against @entity35 in *november*
prop faces surgery after rupturing a tendon in his upper arm
@entity0 's injury is the latest for coach @entity8 who will be without at least 15 stars across the three - test @entity76 series
