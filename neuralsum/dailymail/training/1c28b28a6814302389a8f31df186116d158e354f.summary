@entity0 accused his team of lacking the killer instinct to win the title after @entity4 dropped their first points in almost two months in their 1 - 1 draw against ten - man @entity7			1
@entity9 started his first game for @entity4 since early october and scored as @entity4 came from behind to earn a point – but could n’t go on to seal the win , despite the 65th minute sending off of @entity13			1
and @entity14 , whose side has previously won six consecutive matches , said dropping points in game such as these could be the difference between mounting a serious title challenge or not			1
‘ that ’s the difference			2
’ asked if his side were capable of making a challenge for the @entity24 title , @entity0 said : ‘ no , because you have seen that you have to win these matches and we did n’t win			1
but there is still a long time to go			0
@entity45 has to at @entity46 , it ’s not so easy			0
‘ we dropped two points			0
we were the better team and that ’s frustrating when you do n’t win these games			2
when you want to be a part of the title race then you have to win these games and i think also that we were not so aggressive in the first half as usual			0
@entity13 was dismissed in the second half for a foul on @entity56 @entity57 ( right ) had earlier fired @entity7 into the lead during the first half at @entity60 ‘ we kept the ball much better but we did n’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards			1
that ’s why i changed @entity64 with @entity65 at half time , because i know he ’s more a of a passer to the forwards			0
‘ but it was not good enough to get the victory here			0
we were not creative enough in the second half ; we did n’t keep the ball as well as in the first half but we had more aggression			2
so that was the plus i think			0
' ok we have a draw and that ’s why i ’m a little bit frustrated because we could have won this game , we did n’t do and we are responsible			1
