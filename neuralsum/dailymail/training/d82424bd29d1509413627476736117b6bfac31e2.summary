by @entity0 an artificial pancreas could allow thousands of diabetes patients to live normal lives without constant injections of insulin , researchers claim			1
there are also hopes that the device could eventually help tackle the diabetes epidemic linked to obesity			2
the artificial pancreas resembles an @entity13 and is strapped to patients ’ clothing with a small monitor and pump fitted to their skin			1
the device monitors blood sugar levels and then injects insulin when needed it works by continually monitoring their blood sugar and then giving them regular doses of insulin to ensure it stays at a normal level			0
in the first trial of its kind , 24 @entity31 patients with type 1 diabetes were given the device to wear for a month at home , instead of injecting themselves with insulin			1
around 300,000 @entity31 suffer from type 1 diabetes – a lifelong condition usually diagnosed in children or young adults – which is when the pancreas stops producing insulin			1
they have to inject themselves with insulin between two and five times a day and constantly monitor their blood sugar levels by pricking their fingers and putting samples on testing strips			2
a further 2.9million have @entity52 – whereby the body does not produce enough insulin or does not use it properly			2
the 14 per cent with the most severe forms of type 2 diabetes also need insulin injections			1
because of rising obesity levels , it is estimated that a total of five million @entity31 will have diabetes within the next ten years – the majority @entity52			1
only last week figures showed that a third of adults have borderline diabetes			0
diabetics have to inject themselves with insulin between two and five times a day and constantly monitor their blood sugar levels by pricking their fingers and putting samples on testing strips ( file photo ) @entity76 researchers leading the latest study say the artificial pancreas was so successful that it could also benefit patients with type 2 diabetes			1
future studies will determine whether the device works just as well for them			0
the scientists , whose study is published today in the @entity87 and @entity88 , plan to carry out a much larger trial involving more patients being given artificial pancreases and monitored for much longer			2
if this is as successful , the devices could eventually be routinely used on the @entity94			0
researchers are not sure exactly how much they would cost but similar devices used in @entity97 are around £ 5,000			0
dr @entity98 , lead author of the @entity76 study , said : ‘ the advantage of a system like this one is the ability to fine tune insulin delivery to account for variations in overnight insulin needs			0
‘ the system was able to safely cope with these variations to achieve more consistent glucose control			0
its benefits apply to a wide range of individuals			0
’ dr @entity112 , @entity113 ’s director of research , said : ‘ these results are hugely exciting			0
the potential health benefits of this technology to people with type 1 diabetes could be enormous			1

a further 2.9million have type 2 , often caused by obesity
