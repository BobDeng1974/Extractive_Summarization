team @entity0 have refuted @entity3 's damning claims that the pair betrayed @entity0 's cancer - stricken first husband @entity5 by starting their relationship while he was still alive			1
however sources close to the tv chef have spoken out saying @entity0 acted all along with @entity5 ’s full support and blessing			1
' when he knew he did n't have long left , he gave his tacit approval to @entity15 , ' @entity5 's close friend tells the @entity16			1
@entity0 pictured with ex-husband @entity5 months before his passing ' @entity5 himself sanctioned the relationship when he knew he was going to die			1
he was very keen on his young children having a father figure so actively encouraged @entity0 to sate @entity15			1
' meanwhile @entity0 's friends reject @entity15 's claim that their relationship was sexual before @entity5 's passing			1
@entity3 said on friday : ' @entity0 and i began our relationship during the last six months of her husband @entity5 's life , rather than after his death as she [ @entity0 ] stated in court , ' in what he described as ' clarification ' in a statement that he volunteered to the @entity36			1
' looking back at that time , i very deeply regret that this betrayal of @entity5 occurred			2
' the timing of this ' confession ' infuriated @entity0 's friends , who described it as a ' wicked attempt to smear her '			1
they married in 2003 , two years after the death from cancer of @entity0 's journalist husband and @entity47 's @entity46 - playing friend , @entity5			1
these new claims from @entity15 are barbed and potentially damaging to @entity0 , and all are rebutted by her team			1
@entity0 on the most recent episode of her new show @entity52 one says : ' @entity15 has been doing his worst for months to damage @entity0 because he ca n't bear it that she walked out on him			1
nobody walks out on @entity15 , do they ? why ca n't he just get on with his life and let her get on with hers ? ' @entity0 testified in court that the relationship began after her husband 's death			1
@entity3 and @entity5 had met over gambling games of @entity46 above a restaurant in @entity64 and eventually the journalist brought @entity15 home to meet his wife			1
at the time @entity15 was still married to his second wife @entity68 , mother of his only child @entity69 , 19			2
one of @entity0 's circle said @entity15 became a frequent visitor when @entity5 was ill for four years - and that @entity0 and @entity15 had got close by the time @entity5 died			1
but they added that it was ' disgraceful ' of @entity15 to say what he has			2
this took the form of allegations involving , among other things , @entity0 ’s drug taking and the ultra-delicate matter of when their relationship started — they married in 2003 , two years after the death from cancer of @entity0 ’s journalist husband and @entity47 ’s @entity46 - playing friend , @entity5			1
such is @entity15 ’s apparent determination to harm his third ex-wife that , astonishingly , he is unconcerned that some of what he says contradicts the evidence he gave in court during the @entity92 sisters ’ trial			2
for example , at @entity94 on november 29 , he testified : ‘ i have never , never seen any evidence of @entity0 taking any drugs whatsoever			2
i want to be helpful , but i genuinely have no real knowledge at all			0
’ in response to one question , he said : ‘ are you asking me whether i think @entity0 truly was off her head ? not for a second			2
over this whole period she was writing books very successfully and appearing on television shows very successfully			0
’ back to business : @entity0 tests some a dish on the @entity109 version of her new reality tv series @entity52 now he says : ‘ the truth is that she was taking illegal drugs secretly throughout the last few years of our marriage , often with her own child when she was far too young to even smoke or drink			1
’ drug - taking , he goes on , ‘ took place at an alarmingly frequent rate			0
that this practice seems to be considered acceptable behaviour in sections of the @entity122 is deeply disturbing , as is the notion that you can teach your children that drugs are a justifiable way to make “ an unbearable situation bearable ”			0
’ this is a reference to @entity0 ’s evidence in which she said there had been a point in her life with @entity15 when she used cannabis ‘ to deal with a summer of abuse ’			1
in court @entity0 admitted smoking cannabis in front of the children			0
asked if she smoked ‘ with or in front of the children she replied : ‘ i ’m afraid i did			0
’ she said she took cocaine on six occasions to help with the stress of coping with her late husband ’s terminal cancer , and when subject to moments of @entity15 ’s ‘ intimate terrorism ’ — a phrase with special resonance for @entity15 , as we shall see			2
allegations : @entity3 has told the @entity157 ' took illegal drugs secretly throughout the last few years of our marriage , often with her own child ' so why is he stirring things up now , when he and @entity0 are divorced , living new , separate lives , and the @entity92 prosecution has been resolved ? after all , most men aged 70 , especially one who is successful and worth around £ 135 million , would be happy to see the back of an unsavoury episode which exposed the seediness at the heart of his opulent lifestyle			1
from a family point of view , it is impossible to exaggerate the pain and unhappiness which this continued state of war between him and @entity0 is generating			0
their children are the most obvious victims of the collateral damage			0
last august , @entity69 was put on the telephone by her father so she could read an emotional statement to the @entity36 , expressing her misery at having no contact with @entity0 who had been her virtual mother since she was seven			1
sources close to the family say that @entity0 and @entity69 did have some contact after the parting , but sadly that has stopped and a present sent for @entity69 ’s birthday was politely returned			0
on both sides , friends agree on one other point : what a sad situation it is for this degrading soap opera to come between three youngsters who grew up happily together from an early age			0
@entity15 seemingly wants vengeance , though he does n’t use the word			0
he claims he has ‘ no alternative ’ to say what he ’s saying because of the ‘ inaccurate allegations ’ which @entity0 ‘ made up about me ’ during last month ’s court hearing and in the media			2
‘ i no longer feel the need to cover up for her any more , ’ he says			0
according to friends , he is furious with @entity0 for linking her drug - taking with that vague but devastating phrase ‘ intimate terrorism ’ , implying that somehow it was his behaviour that drove her to drugs			2
he told a friend : ‘ she ’s saying it was my fault she did drugs			0
’ the friend adds : ‘ he ’s angry that he went into court first and spoke up for her , but when it was her turn to give evidence she gave him a monstering			0
previous marriage : @entity15 claims he and @entity0 started their relationship in the last six months of her previous marriage to late journalist @entity5 - the two pictured together in 1999 ‘ @entity229 also can not forgive @entity0 for not speaking out on his behalf over the choking business			1
’ astonishingly , there are now no fewer than five offered explanations for the lunchtime episode at @entity236 ’s restaurant			0
explanation 1 : when given a police caution for his action , @entity3 described the incident as nothing more than ‘ a playful tiff ’			0
explanation 2 : he told the @entity244 court : ‘ i was not gripping , strangling or throttling her			0
i was holding her head by the neck to make her focus			0
can we be clear ? was it about her drugs use ? no. ’ explanation 3 : @entity0 , who had remained silent about the episode for five months — infuriating @entity15 — until stepping into the witness box at the @entity92 trial , told the court that she had spotted a child in a pram and made a comment about her excitement at the prospect of being a grandmother , at which he grabbed her throat saying : ‘ i ’m the only person you should be concerned with			1
’ explanation 4 : some of the pictures showed @entity15 looking in her nose , ostensibly for cocaine			0
@entity0 told the court : ‘ this was a story he ( @entity15 ) made up afterwards because i would not go back and clear his name			1
’ explanation 5 : the row was over whether @entity0 ’s daughter should go to university — @entity15 believed @entity275 should go to university			2
anger : according to friends , @entity15 - pictured with @entity0 in happier times - is furious with his ex-wife for implying his behaviour drove her to drugs how the two must now wish the @entity92 sisters had never been prosecuted for fraud over their spending of nearly £ 700,000 on a @entity15 private company credit card			1
acquitted by a jury , they promptly sold their story to a red - top newspaper			0
for @entity15 and @entity0 , the trial meant almost endless exposure and embarrassment as their lives were laid bare in excruciating detail			2
so whose idea was it to call in the police ? according to @entity15 it was @entity0 ’s decision , not his , to prosecute the @entity304 sisters who worked for her for more than a decade			2
‘ had it been my choice there would have been no trial , ’ he declares			0
‘ there was no way for me to recoup the money they had spent , or the legal bills and the many weeks required to quantify the damage and build the case			0
’ trial : @entity15 says it was @entity0 's decision to prosecute the @entity92 sisters - pictured on @entity318 's @entity317 - leading to endless speculation about the pair 's private lives @entity0 ’s supporters point out that this claim directly contradicts his statement to the police in january last year — it was read out in court — in which he says that ‘ in light of [ the @entity332 ’ ] behaviour it would be better to instigate proceedings against them ’			1
on july 23 , after talking to his accountant , @entity15 was quoted as saying : ‘ i then decided that matters had reached a point where there was no alternative but to report the matter to the police			0
’ @entity15 decided to release his latest fusillade against @entity0 after she appeared on @entity343 , seen as her first step towards regaining the public ’s affection			2
having declared war on her , @entity3 is clearly refusing to end hostilities			0
most people think it is a war he can not win .			0

@entity0 is back on the nation 's screens for new show the taste
meanwhile , ex-husband @entity15 continues to dwell on *domestic* *goddess*
offered *extraordinary* ' clarification ' to the @entity36
says chef took drugs throughout final years of their marriage
claims relationship began before death of her first husband @entity5
but @entity5 's friend says he ' actively encouraged them to date ' in last days
@entity0 's friends reject claim relationship turned sexual prior to death
