the original calfskin @entity1 has survived for over 900 years , considerably longer than a mirror project by the @entity3 launched in 1986 on laser discs			1
the corporation ’s aim was to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the book with a modern - day version using quotes , maps and videos - but the discs just did n’t take off and within 10 years the equipment that could read it was obsolete			1
now the whole project has been rebooted , with the @entity17 loaded onto a computer with a 52in touch - screen that ’s on display at @entity21 at @entity22			2
slick : the new @entity17 multi-media @entity23 at @entity21 the book was commissioned in december 1085 by @entity26			2
he had taken @entity27 by force in 1066 and wanted to know precisely what his spoils of war were			0
the finished tome contained records of no less than 13,418 @entity27 settlements			0
the @entity3 ’s project in 1986 was welcomed by historians as like the original , it would provide a handy insight into life in 1986 - but market forces consigned it to history			1
living history : @entity44 can be viewed by several people at once and provides a snapshot of life in 1986 and 2011 to view the discs you needed to put an @entity51 computer , an scsi controller and a @entity54 laserdisc player on your shopping list			0
none of this equipment endured the test of time , so the @entity3 set about finding alternative hardware to do the job			1
luckily , a joint @entity64 - @entity63 project called @entity65 ( @entity66 at @entity67 & @entity68 : emulating the @entity69 on the @entity70 ) saved the corporation ’s blushes			2
out with the old : the clunky equipment needed in 1986 to view the @entity17 researchers emulated a @entity75 and the laser disc player and extracted the @entity3 ’s data in a form that could be easily transferred to 2011 technology			1
in april this year @entity80 was launched which saw extra information and observations about life in 2011 added to the original documents and loaded onto the touch - screen device			1
called the @entity44 , it contains @entity87 of information and can be browsed by four different people at the same time			0
test of time : the original @entity1 was written in 1086 @entity91 was the team leader from the original project and contributed to @entity80			0
he told the @entity3 : ‘ i think it 's amazing			1
we 're very very pleased			0
it 's taken us a generation - 25 years later			1
a new generation of programmers made this happen			0
' the exhibition at @entity99 opened yesterday			0
key data from the @entity1 has been available online since 2004 , while the original book is kept under lock and key at the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 .			2

original *domesday* book is over 900 years old - the @entity3 's version lasted 10 years
