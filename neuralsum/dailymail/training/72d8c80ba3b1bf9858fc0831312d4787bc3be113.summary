@entity0 is turning its retail stores into art galleries featuring the work of photographers and other artists who use @entity6 , iphones and @entity9 computers to create			1
they include paintings , photographs and short films by both professional and amateur @entity0 fans			1
the firm is set to install the artworks in all of its stores in an unprecedented move , saying it hopes to inspire others			1
scroll down to see all the artworks and videos artwork from artists @entity25 and @entity27 is on display on the wall of an @entity30 in @entity31			2
the pairs both used @entity33 's to create the piece through apps @entity36 and waterlogue			2
the also used @entity38 to chat about the work			2
' every piece in this gallery was created on an @entity0 product , ' @entity0 said			1
' every brushstroke , every pixel , and every frame of film was brought to life by talented @entity0 users from around the world			1
' as you explore their work , we hope it inspires you to create something new			2
' travel photographer @entity56 told @entity57 he used an @entity58 6 to take otherworldly panoramic photos of an @entity61 glacier			1
he said it was ' surreal ' seeing the artwork blown up in the firm 's @entity65 store in @entity31			2
he originally began taking pictures as a way to help review @entity0 products for a website			1
he said the larger screen was a major change			2
' it 's so nice to shoot with a big screen - it 's almost like the old medium format cameras , ' he said			2
@entity56 , who recalls mowing lawns for a summer as a 7th grader to save up for his first , bright green imac in 1998 , says his use of an @entity58 and high - end cameras is ' split pretty even ' when it comes to professional work			1
' in the photography industry especially , when you are getting started you are always seeking gear , ' if i could only get this $ 1,000 lens , '' he said			2
using just an @entity58 to take great photos encourages people to ' shift away from focusing on gear and equipment			1
' @entity56 told @entity57 he was driving along the @entity61 coast when a bank of fog lifted to reveal the biggest glacier he had ever seen			2
to reach it and get the shot , @entity56 left all his gear in the car , put his @entity100 in his pocket , and climbed down a steep rock face to capture the photo in panorama mode			2
he then used the @entity106 app to edit the image in the car on his way back to a hotel			0
@entity0 commissioned the work of 12 artists at various stages of their career to create works meant to inspire			1
showcasing the people who use its technology - in this case , painters , photographers , filmmakers and other visual artists — is a shift for a company long focused on making its products front and center			2
the artwork , done on @entity130 devices and @entity9 using various apps , is displayed on @entity0 's website as part of an ad campaign called ' start something new			1
' and the @entity137 , @entity138 - based company is replacing all product signage in its retail stores with the artwork			2
just as technology has transformed the way we work and interact with one another , it has also changed the way we create			0
@entity148 used @entity36 on an @entity149 to create the modern interpretation on emoji @entity152 , a professional photographer , used and @entity58 and @entity154 app to capture these stunning mountain scenes for painter @entity157 , that 's meant shifting away from the canvases and acrylic paint he started out using in art school to an @entity58 app called brushes			1
after not painting for many years , @entity157 in 2010 read about a group of artists who started using their iphones and sometimes @entity6 , which had just come out			0
' i had an iphone at home and i downloaded the @entity172 app , ' he says			0
' that was a wonderful , simple application			0
' it was also challenging			0
when he painted on a canvas , he painted life - size works			0
painting on a 3.5 inch - screen was an entirely different thing			0
' what i liked about it was that there was no setup , ' @entity157 says			0
with all the prep work that comes with traditional painting , he says , ' by the time you have everything out the moment has ( often ) passed			0
' @entity157 used the app @entity193 to paint with his fingers on the @entity197 @entity199 artist @entity198 shot handfuls of colorful paper from different angles with an @entity100			1
he slowly moved the camera as a painter might move a brush , while using the @entity206 ! app to lengthen the exposure time @entity157 , whose website lists exhibitions in cities from @entity212 to @entity31 to @entity213 , says he has not painted traditionally for many years			2
and he prefers painting on the @entity197 to using a traditional computer			1
using the app @entity193 to paint with his fingers on the @entity197 , ' you do n't feel like you are fighting a computer to create your art. ' you feel connected to the artwork , ' he says			1
' when i first used an @entity197 , it made me think of cave paintings , or when a child first paints using their finger			1
' while some artists may look at digital painting as ' cheating ' — after all , you can delete mistaken brush strokes — @entity157 , who lives in @entity232 , thinks it actually makes artists more daring			0
' if you spent 50 pounds ( $ 75 ) on canvas and another 50 pounds on paint , at some point you are going to get careful			0
you do n't want to waste what you spent , ' he says			0
for @entity0 's display , @entity157 used @entity193 to paint portraits of people he encountered at the university where he lectures			1
@entity245 took photos of rainy cityscapes from behind a sheet of glasswith the @entity58 6 for @entity0 's project			1
' @entity250 ' uses the phone 's own camera app to bring drops of rain on glass into focus , showing ordinary scenes through a different perspective			0
@entity259 used the burst mode funtion of the @entity197 2 to capture the swimmer they include a bearded , mustached young man with bright yellow glasses and an intense stare , and a woman in a floppy black hat lost in thought			1
@entity245 , whose photography career spans two decades and has shot for fashion icons such as @entity272 and @entity273 and magazines ranging from @entity275 to @entity276 , took photos of rainy cityscapes with the @entity58 6 for @entity0 's project			1
' @entity250 ' uses the phone 's own camera app to bring drops of rain on glass into focus , showing ordinary scenes through a different perspective			0
@entity283 used @entity36 on an @entity149 to create this image of @entity285			0
she also used the @entity287 app to capture her own facial expressions , which were then transposed onto the figures in the artwork			0
@entity245 bought an @entity58 in 2007 , when they first came out			1
having worked with @entity293 cameras early in his career , he found the quality of the original @entity58 's camera very similar			1
' it was quite soft and the colors were muted and distorted , ' he says			0
' the moment i picked up the phone and started taking pictures , it reminded me of photography in its infancy			0
' you could n't focus , change exposure			0
' you just saw something and took a photo			0
' the artist known only as @entity310 used an @entity197 2 and the brushes 3 app , painting with her fingers photographs from photographer @entity316 are on display on the wall of an @entity30 in @entity31 , as seen through a glass staircase			1
the artist used an @entity58 and the @entity322 app to create them the quality of phone cameras has certainly improved in the last several years			1
but more importantly , the ease of use and always - in - hand nature of a smartphone camera has in many ways democratized photography , encouraging anyone to make a photo diary of daily moments , not just special events or trips			0
' @entity337 has n't made any nicer pictures , ' @entity245 says			0
' but they have opened up the world to people who would have not necessarily thought of taking pictures , or sharing them			0
