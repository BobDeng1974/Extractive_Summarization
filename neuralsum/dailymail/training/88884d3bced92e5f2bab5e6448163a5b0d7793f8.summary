' the little ones tend to be a bit frightened , because they do n't know who i am but they soon figure out that i 'm the person who gives presents , ' he said			1
' from my own personal experience , what we 're having is a tradition that parents have taken from their own childhood that they want their kids to have , ' he said			0
' parents get the children to stand next to me or try to put them on my knee			0
sometimes they cry and are quickly taken off			0
' ' the experience does vary , so while they generally sit on my knee , it 's personalised depending on what the parents want and how the children react			1
' @entity82 , 32 , used to work as a photographer for a @entity20 experience company , and has a two - year - old daughter			1

@entity129 , deputy director of the @entity130 , said that parents should have the right to assume that this minimum standard has been met for every person who dons a @entity1 suit			0
' typically , at a minimum a @entity137 or ' @entity138 ' will be required to ensure that people working or volunteering with children do not have prior convictions that would make them a risk to children 's safety , ' she said			2
' child protection do n't need to get involved , it 's up to parents to decide what is best for their child			1
parent 's need to be able to make decisions , and choices are being taken away in a lot of different situations , ' said @entity82			2
' @entity1 ' , from @entity156 , said that children are never forced to sit on his lap ' i actually want my daughter to sit on @entity1 's lap , but she does n't like @entity1 and that does n't bother us			1
if children start crying , the helpers sympathise , they do n't force the issue , ' she said			0

@entity181 @entity180 worked at @entity182 in @entity183 and @entity184 in @entity185 where the prosecution alleges he used his position as ' @entity1 ' to assault the girls			0
mr @entity191 's legal council said that the evidence did not ' make sense ' because several parents did not intervene to stop the alleged abuse while it was happening in front of them , reported @entity198			0
' it just does not make sense that a mother would sit around and watch a person fiddle with their daughter â€™s vagina for five minutes and not do anything , ' said @entity207			0
' the risk would be of inappropriate touching of the child , which would need to occur in the brief time the child was on " @entity1 's " lap for the photo , under the observation of the parent , with the potential to be caught on film , and with the potential for the child to speak out , ' said ms @entity129			1
' we know from the work of researchers like professor @entity223 that child sex offending is often opportunistic and perpetrators will choose circumstances in which the chance of detection is low , ' ' theoretically , the @entity1 photo would seem to me to be a low - risk scenario , largely due to the heightened risk for detection			2
' @entity82 said that parents were observant and looking after their kids while the photo was being taken			2
' we need to stop bubble wrapping kids , we 're not stupid			0
we know what 's right and wrong , ' she said			0

the only people who actually sit on my lap are office workers at @entity20 parties			0

child protection activist @entity21 has called for shopping malls update their protection policies so that children stand next to ' @entity1 ' and not on his lap
a professional @entity1 said that children were never forced to sit on his lap , as many were *confused* , cried , or tired
he said that the experienced was very personalised and differed depending on the child , so that many would be held , or stand next to him
@entity82 , who used to work as a @entity1 photographer and now has a two - year - old daughter , said that kids wo n't do what they do n't want to do
all @entity1 's are checked for criminal *backgrounds* , and laws introduced in 2013 brought in even more thorough regulations for anyone working with minors
