last january , former @entity1 boss @entity0 slammed the @entity2 as a distraction — claiming that most @entity5 managers would prefer to avoid the grand old competition			0
@entity7 of @entity9 @entity8 would probably be inclined to disagree			2
on monday night , the @entity11 side will kick off their 37th cup tie in the last four seasons when they travel to @entity14 for an @entity2 quarter - final replay			1
@entity7 has had terrific success in cup competitions with @entity8 in the last four years since taking over in august 2011 , @entity7 has led his side to an average extra 10 games each campaign as @entity8 have reached the @entity22 final and enjoyed lengthy runs in the @entity24 and @entity2			1
these exploits have seen them play 37 cup ties on top of their four 46 - game league campaigns during @entity7 's tenure — almost an additional @entity5 season 's worth of fixtures			2
@entity8 have vanquished no fewer than five top - flight sides — @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity1 , @entity37 and @entity38 — beaten 14 higher - division teams and won 21 , drawn four and lost just 11 ties in total			0
they also have a 100 - per - cent record in penalty shootouts under @entity7 , winning all seven they have contested			0
@entity8 reached the @entity22 final in 2013 where they were beaten by @entity48 and far from sidelining their progress in the league , this rich experience of knockout football helped @entity8 win promotion to @entity9 via the play - offs in 2013			1
their victory over @entity58 at @entity59 was their second visit to the national stadium that year after @entity22 final defeat to @entity48 , and was their 64th game in all competitions			0
even if they ca n't secure a third trip down @entity68 at the @entity69 , @entity8 are still firmly in the hunt for promotion to the @entity72 — sitting just three points off sixth place with a game in hand			0
perhaps the league and cup can be mutually beneficial after all ... the cup pedigree helped @entity7 will promotion with @entity8 via the playoffs , reaching @entity9 2011 - 12 ( 7 ) - 18th in @entity82 @entity24 round 1 : @entity84 ( @entity9 ) ( h ) d0 - 0 ( won 3 - 1 on penalties ) @entity24 round 2 : @entity86 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity87 ( won 4 - 2 on penalties ) @entity24 area quarter - final : @entity90 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity91 ( won 6 - 5 on penalties ) @entity2 round 1 : @entity94 ( @entity9 ) ( h ) @entity95 - 0 @entity2 round 2 : @entity96 ( @entity82 ) ( h ) @entity95 - 1 @entity24 area semi-final : @entity98 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity99 - 2 @entity2 round 3 : @entity100 ( @entity72 ) ( a ) @entity101 - 4 2012 - 13 ( 18 ) - 7th in @entity82 ( promoted via play - offs ) @entity22 round 1 : @entity104 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity95 - 0 ( aet ) @entity22 round 2 : @entity100 ( @entity72 ) ( a ) @entity95 - 1 @entity22 round 3 : @entity106 ( @entity82 ) ( h ) @entity95 - 2 ( aet ) @entity24 round 2 : @entity108 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) d0 - 0 ( won 3 - 2 on penalties ) * @entity22 round 4 : @entity35 ( @entity5 ) ( a ) @entity110 - 0 ( won 4 - 2 on penalties ) @entity2 round 1 : @entity58 ( @entity82 ) ( a ) @entity91 - 1 @entity2 r1 replay : @entity58 ( @entity82 ) ( h ) @entity114 - 3 ( won 4 - 2 on penalties ) @entity2 round 2 : @entity116 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) d1 - 1 @entity24 area quarter - final : @entity118 ( @entity82 ) ( a ) @entity95 - 0 @entity22 quarter - final : @entity36 ( @entity5 ) ( h ) @entity91 - 1 ( won 3 - 2 on penalties ) @entity2 r2 replay : @entity116 ( @entity9 ) ( h ) @entity101 - 4 @entity22 semi-final first leg : @entity1 ( @entity5 ) ( h ) @entity95 - 1 @entity24 area semi-final : @entity125 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity126 - 4 @entity22 semi-final second leg : @entity1 ( @entity5 ) ( a ) @entity126 - 2 @entity22 final : @entity48 ( @entity5 ) ( n ) @entity99 - 5 @entity82 play - off semi-final first leg : @entity106 ( h ) @entity101 - 3 @entity82 play - off semi-final second leg : @entity106 ( a ) @entity95 - 1 @entity82 play - off final : @entity58 ( n ) @entity95 - 0 * @entity8 had a first - round bye 2013 - 14 ( 3 ) - 11th in @entity9 @entity22 round 1 : @entity86 ( @entity72 ) ( a ) @entity126 - 2 @entity24 round 1 : @entity108 ( @entity82 ) ( a ) @entity99 - 5 @entity2 round 1 : @entity138 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity99 - 3 2014 - 15 ( 12 ) - currently 9th in @entity9 @entity22 round 1 : @entity140 ( @entity82 ) ( a ) @entity95 - 0 @entity22 round 2 : @entity141 ( @entity72 ) ( h ) @entity95 - 1 @entity24 round 1 : @entity98 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity99 - 1 @entity22 round 3 : @entity143 ( @entity9 ) ( a ) @entity99 - 2 @entity2 round 1 : @entity145 ( @entity146 ) ( a ) @entity95 - 1 @entity2 round 2 : @entity147 ( @entity146 ) ( h ) @entity148 - 1 @entity2 round 3 : @entity149 ( @entity72 ) ( a ) @entity114 - 3 @entity2 r3 replay : @entity149 ( @entity72 ) ( h ) @entity148 - 0 @entity2 round 4 : @entity37 ( @entity5 ) ( a ) @entity148 - 2 @entity2 round 5 : @entity38 ( @entity5 ) ( h ) @entity95 - 0 @entity2 round 6 : @entity14 ( @entity72 ) ( h ) d0 - 0 @entity2 r6 replay : @entity14 ( @entity72 ) ( a )			1
