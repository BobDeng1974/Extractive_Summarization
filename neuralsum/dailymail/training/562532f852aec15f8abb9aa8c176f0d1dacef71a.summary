@entity0 has just celebrated her 40th birthday			1
and she has done so not with a silent mope over a mug of gin about getting old , but a whoop and a cheer ... and the confession that she is in better shape now than she ever was in her 20s			1
the ' @entity10 ' , who was married to rock singer @entity12 from 2005 to 2007 , said : ' i have better knowledge of my body and how to treat it			1
between 18 and 20 i was a few pounds heavier , as i used to drink fizzy drinks and eat fast food			2
' fit at 40 : @entity0 , pictured as a fresh - faced young dancer ( left ) and in @entity19 on friday ( right ) , says she feels in better shape now than she did in her 20s shaken , not stirred : @entity0 performs her famous martini glass routine during a photo - call for the @entity22 in @entity23 in 2006 in an interview with closer magazine , @entity26 - who is 5ft 3in and weighs 8st 3lbs - also admitted going through a ' party girl ' phase in the 90s			1
during that time - when she was taking @entity31 and @entity32 - her weight dropped to just 6.5st			1
the odd couple : @entity0 , aged 29 , pictured in @entity34 with beau @entity12 , whom she married in 2005 ' i got skinny , ' said the @entity37 - born dancer whose real name is @entity0			2
' i was worried about the way i looked but also about the impact it was having on my health			2
' i remember seeing a picture of myself and my ribs were sticking out			2
' that was my motivation for not doing drugs anymore			0
' @entity26 , who began performing burlesque in 1992 and whose most famous routine involves her frolicking inside an enormous @entity52 glass , also revealed she did n't expect to find herself where she is now , aged 40 , when she was young			0
' i thought i 'd be married and retired by 28			0
i did n't think i 'd be at the top of my career in striptease			0
' i do n't worry about having kids and it affecting my body			0
' i 'd have to rethink things if that happened , but it would n't make me any less of a woman if it did n't			0
' she confesses that she has n't yet drawn a line through having plastic surgery and will one day ' probably look at lasers '			1
the star explains that she maintains her tiny 22 - inch waist ( which can be squeezed down to 16.5in ) by eating healthily , rarely drinking , avoiding bread , and drinking a vegetable smoothie made from ingredients including parsley , coriander and spinach every morning			0
she also exercises daily and has worn a corset since she was just 18			1
saying she feels best about herself around eight stone , the raven - haired beauty says her strict exercise regime includes @entity81 , ballet , exercise videos , horse - riding and dressage , and she plans to take up fencing soon , too			1
but just like the rest of us , @entity26 has several ' cheat ' foods she ca n't always resist			0
crisps , crunchy sweets and @entity91 food feature high on her naughty - but - nice list			0
unlike the rest of us , the woman 's incredible willpower means these ' naughty ' treats are few and far between , which is why she looks as amazing now as she did when she burst on to the burlesque scene over two decades ago			0
cosmetic enhancement : @entity26 , who has n't had any cosmetic surgery yet , confesses that she has n't ruled it out and will one day ' probably look at lasers ' in love : @entity12 and @entity0 arrive for the @entity105 2006 , at the @entity106 at the @entity107 , east @entity23			1
