today show host @entity0 has accused education minister @entity2 of ‘ apologising ’ for @entity4 president @entity3 about how the @entity7 duo 's journey to their place of execution has been handled			1
a fired - up @entity11 said there had been a ‘ full blown and seemingly over the top operation ’ as @entity18 and @entity19 were transferred from @entity14 prison in @entity15 to the @entity4 ‘ death island ’ of nusakambangan on wednesday			1
she also pointed out to @entity2 and @entity22 frontbencher @entity21 that @entity15 ’s police chief was ‘ all smiles as he took photos with the two men condemned to death ’			1
‘ elite military vehicles , decoy vehicles , fighter jets , riot squad police - you would have to say right now that president @entity3 , rather than listening to the @entity37 government ’s pleas for clemency , he ’s treating these men like prize catches , he ’s thumbing his nose at us right now is n’t he ? , ’ @entity11 asked @entity2			1
‘ to be fair , the @entity4 justice system and president @entity3 is treating the @entity37 prisoners the same as all the other foreign prisoners in @entity4 , ’ @entity2 diplomatically replied			1
@entity2 : ‘ i think that is much more appropriate but i think to try and characterise president @entity3 as thumbing his nose at @entity37 is something a federal cabinet minister is going to endorse			1
’ ‘ but you are apologising for him @entity86 , with the greatest respect , ’ @entity11 said			2
‘ i ’m certainly not doing that @entity0 i am opposed to the death penalty , ’ @entity2 reasoned			2
the pictures in question emerged on thursday of a smiling police commissioner posing with the two condemned @entity37 drug smugglers on the two hour flight to nusakambangan			2
@entity37 will lodge an official complaint with @entity4 's ambassador , @entity95 , at their outrage and ethical displeasure with these images			1
one of the pictures depicts @entity100 , the police chief of the @entity15 capital of @entity59 , placing his hand on @entity19 's shoulder and smiling for the camera			1
another shows his hand on the shoulder of @entity18 who was captured gazing up at the officer			2
although summoned to the @entity109 , ambassador @entity95 is understood to be in @entity110 and can not appear in person			0
shackled and handcuffed , @entity19 cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless @entity4 police officers across the tarmac after being taken from @entity116 prison in @entity15 to their final destination , @entity118 @entity120 despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner , @entity18 , as he arrived at @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity4 , only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside @entity115 on the island of @entity15 an @entity4 armoured police vehicle transporting the death - row @entity37 prisoners @entity19 and @entity18 to @entity132 leaving the @entity115 in @entity59 , @entity15 @entity4 police stand guard to secure the area around @entity115 in @entity59 on @entity15 on march 4 a senior official , likely to be department secretary @entity137 will inform the ambassador of @entity37 's shock at the images through a telephone call whilst also appealing again for clemency			1
@entity100 told @entity143 that he was trying to raise the spirits of the @entity37 by urging them to be tough and brave and had no idea the photo was being taken			0
' it was not a selfie moment , ' he said			0
complaints will also be made about the excessive use of force used in transporting the men from @entity15 's @entity115 to the airport			1
foreign minister @entity154 said on thursday that she could not comprehend the enormous display of force by the @entity4 military			2
@entity154 described her shock at the force used to transport the condemned @entity37 drug smugglers @entity0 said the @entity4 president is ' thumbing his nose at us right now ' the @entity37 drug smugglers have plead to @entity4 's president @entity3 for clemency , to no avail ' they 've never done anything that would suggest they are violent , or that they would risk anybody else 's lives , ' she said			1
when the images were captured on wednesday , the @entity7 duo were being transported on a two hour flight to the port town of @entity177 and transferred to nusakambangan island where they are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as ' @entity182 ' , a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms			0
the spot is called @entity187 , and it 's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of nusakambangan , which is also known as ' @entity118 ' , and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the @entity4 government executed five drug smugglers			2
the family of condemned @entity37 drug smuggler @entity19 , his mother @entity194 ( centre ) and brother @entity197 ( wearing pink shorts ) arrive at @entity200 on thursday to make the five hour drive to @entity177 in @entity124 and take a boat to nusakambangan island where @entity19 is waiting to be executed @entity18 's mother @entity204 ( right ) and sister @entity205 ( centre ) on the tarmac at @entity200 , the closest main airport to the port town of @entity177 to which they will drive on thursday afternoon to visit him in @entity210 prison on nusakambangan island where the @entity7 duo was transferred to under high security this week last place on earth : this is @entity187 , also known as ' @entity182 ' , the place where @entity19 and @entity18 will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells this is the spot to which the @entity4 took five foreign drug smugglers this year , tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12 - member firing squads at around 12.40am local time on sunday , january 18 it is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to @entity230 valley , as it lies down a narrow dirt track ( above ) amid dense vegetation in the middle of @entity235 off southern central @entity124 this weather beaten hut in @entity230 or @entity182 sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in january and where the @entity37 @entity7 duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad final journey : the jungle and rainforest of @entity246 prison island looms over the @entity248 armoured personnel van carrying @entity19 and @entity18 as they arrive off the police boat on wednesday following their final plane flight , from @entity15 to @entity177 in southern @entity124 and this place , up a winding dirt track just 3km from where @entity19 and @entity18 are being held in isolation cells , is likely to soon be their last place on earth			1
situated quite high up amid hills in the island 's centre , @entity187 was also the place where the @entity15 bombers , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 were executed in 2008 , six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people , including 88 @entity37 , 38 @entity4 and 27 @entity269			1
at the top of the hills surrounding @entity187 , it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the @entity273 to the south			0
at around 12.40am on january 18 this year , five drug traffickers were reportedly shot by firing squads in or around this place			0
this is the exterior of @entity210 prison on @entity246 island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold @entity37 @entity19 and @entity18 ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad @entity4 executed a total of six drug traffickers on january 18 , but @entity289 woman @entity287 met her fate on the mainland of central java at a place called @entity294			1
the five executed at @entity230 on @entity296 were @entity298 @entity297 , 53 , who smuggled 13kg of coaine in hangliding equipment to @entity15 in 2004 , @entity301 national @entity303 , who ran an @entity306 factory , @entity307 , 48 , @entity4 woman , @entity308 , 38 , and @entity310 @entity309 , 38 , a @entity311 who elected to be buried on the island			2
the lead up to execution in ' @entity182 ' has been well documented			0
under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in @entity4 's criminal act of 1964 , the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out			2
they are reportedly allowed three ' last requests ' but these may only be in the form of final statements , such as that from ms @entity308 who wrote , ' submission does not mean give up			0
do the best , @entity329 will finish the rest '			0
port of no return : @entity332 ( above ) on @entity235 was the dropping off point on wednesday for the @entity37 @entity7 duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation dressed in simple , white clothing , they are accompanied by a physician , clergy and an ' execution attorney ' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner			0
in the case of @entity187 , the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth			0
at a clearing , three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner			0
when the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready , the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing , sitting or kneeling for their execution			0
a black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to ' calm down ' before the execution takes place			0
although a clergyman of the prisoner 's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites , @entity298 @entity297 was reportedly denied access to @entity177 's catholic priest @entity372 and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner , but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to @entity230 .			0
