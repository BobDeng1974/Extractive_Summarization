by @entity0 last updated at 1:46 am on 24th november 2011 when builders digging up @entity3 and @entity5 ’s patio for an extension came to the back door clutching a human skull , the couple were understandably alarmed			1
but fear turned to fascination after experts said four bodies unearthed by the workmen came from a burial site dating back as much as 1,400 years to the middle @entity16 period			1
archaeologists believe the skeletons may have been there since @entity20 and are part of a much larger burial ground under the home in the @entity25 village of @entity26			1
ancient skeletons of four people were unearthed during extension works at the @entity31 home , @entity32 , of @entity3 ( pictured ) and @entity5			1
the 1,400 - year - old remains are part of an @entity35 burial ground they say the remains of two women , a man and a child aged between ten and 12 provide an insight into an obscure period			1
analysis of the bones shows that the population at the time suffered from periods of malnourishment and would have been in near - constant pain because of infections			2
mr @entity5 , 55 , said : ‘ it was a bit of a shock to find out i ’ve been living above an ancient burial site all these years			1
‘ it ’s a privilege to be so close to such amazing history – and as long as they do n’t wake me up , i ’m quite happy for it to stay that way			2
’ radiocarbon dating has revealed the bones date back to between 650ad and @entity61 the bones were taken away first to @entity63 and then to @entity64 for testing by expert archaeologists life of pain : @entity35 men suffered from long periods of malnourishment and infection he added : ‘ we had builders in as we were extending the back of our house , and i heard one of them knock on the door			1
' i was absolutely amazed when i saw a workman standing holding a skull – he just said “ i think there ’s something you should see ”			2
‘ i was praying that the bodies were really old and we had n’t stumbled across something more grisly			0
‘ but the archaeologists came over within a couple of hours and said it was quite likely there were a lot more bodies under the house			2
’ mr @entity5 said he had joked at the start of the building work that they might find something from the @entity99 because their house is near the site of the battle of @entity103 , where the army of @entity104 clashed with @entity106 in 1642			0
but the remarkable archaeological find pre-dates that by nearly 1,000 years			0
carbon - dating from two of the skeletons showed that they died between 650 and 820 ad			0
@entity111 was then divided into a number of kingdoms and the area may have been a frontier in another war between the @entity35 kingdom of the @entity118 and the eventually dominant @entity120 kingdom of @entity121			0
@entity122 , of @entity25 , said : ‘ the discovery of this previously unsuspected burial ground is an extremely rare and important addition to what has previously been an archaeologically invisible period of @entity25 ’s history			2
’ mr @entity5 , who runs an online bird feed company , said further digs may be limited			0
‘ we ’re interested to know what ’s down there , but to be honest we ’d like to keep the bit of the house we live in standing where it is , so we wo n’t be searching too hard			0
’ the early @entity35 founded much of @entity111 as we know it , including developing systems of justice and currency			0
they ruled @entity111 through the upheavals of the @entity143 right up to the @entity144 of 1066			0
archaeologists have identified the remains of at least four bodies which included two adult females , a young male and a juvenile aged between 10 and 12 mr @entity5 ( pictured outside his home ) says the find is ' spine - tingling ' to think he 's been sleeping on top of such history			1

' the builder knocked and said " @entity3 , i think there 's something you need to see " . he had a skull in his hand and i thought " oh my *goodness* " '
archaeologists identified two adult females , a young male and a juvenile aged between 10 and 12
' you do hear all these stories about ancient burial grounds bringing curses , we just have to hope they *'re* not true i suppose '
