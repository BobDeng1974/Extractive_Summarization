by @entity1 reporter published : 20:34 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 04:57 est , 2 january 2014 men who ca n't function without an early morning coffee kick can now get it as they 're having a shave			2
a new product has added caffeine to normal shaving cream			2
it is absorbed by the skin â€“ and an energy boost can be felt within five minutes , even before you 've put your trousers on			1
the effect of the product is thought to set in when a man uses the matching aftershave			0
men who normally head to the kitchen for a cup of coffee in the morning could now kick start their day in the bathroom , thanks to a new caffeinated shaving cream an 85g bottle of the cream contains around 50mg of caffeine which is about the same level as a fizzy drink such as @entity29			2
it also helps to reduce red patches and blemishes on the skin			1
the bizarre cosmetic , dubbed the @entity35 , was invented by @entity36 , 43 , after he spotted the gap in the market			1
@entity36 , who is from @entity39 , said : ' there is lots of innovation on things like razors but not that much for shaving creams			1
' i saw that there was a gap in the market and i knew that caffeine is a vasoconstrictor and an antioxidant that helps reduce redness and keeps skin feeling healthy			1
' i spoke to a chemist and we infused caffeine into a shaving cream and not only does it help the skin , but it is actually absorbed into the body			1
' it probably would n't be as effective as a cup of coffee and is more like the effect given from a can of fizzy drink , but you can definitely feel it			0
' there is about 50mg of caffeine in a bottle of the shaving cream and between 40 and 80mg in a cup of coffee			0
' although the shaving cream is made from caffeine derived from coffee beans it does n't smell of coffee and instead has a peppermint oil scent			0
' as it is just 85g it is a good size for travellers and can be taken on aeroplanes because it is within the flying restrictions			0
' the shaving cream costs around five pounds from an online shop .			0
