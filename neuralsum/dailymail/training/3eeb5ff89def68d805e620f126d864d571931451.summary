by @entity0 published : 03:23 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 13 june 2013 libraries should pay authors a fair sum each time they lend out an e-book or writers will go bust , a leading novelist claimed today			1
@entity8 , best - selling writer of the @entity11 children 's fantasy trilogy , says authors could lose up to two - thirds of their income and even be forced to give up writing altogether if hard copies of books in libraries are replaced by e-books			1
a new reporty by the @entity20 , of which mr @entity8 is president - elect , warns : ' there is a risk that e-books have the potential to undermine the perceived value of books generally to a point below which [ writing ] ceases to be commercially valuable			1
' the risk is even higher with e-lending			0
' author @entity8 says writers must be paid fairly when e-books of their work are borrowed from libraries as president - elect of the @entity20 , mr @entity8 is leading a campaign to force publishers and the government to make sure writers are paid properly when electronic versions of their work are borrowed from public libraries			1
e-books are a growing trend , with consumer sales up more than 130 per cent last year			0
the @entity20 estimates that more than half a million e-books were lent out through libraries in the first 10 months of last year			1
but , the society says , authors are not seeing income from that stream			0
under the current royalty system , authors are paid about 6p by the government each time a paper version of their book is borrowed from a library , but paid nothing when a e-version is borrowed			2
the society has also discovered that publishers may be unintentionally underpaying writers for e-book loans , meaning they could be losing out twice over			2
mr @entity8 said : ' new media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting , for all kinds of reasons , but one principle remains unchanged : authors must be paid fairly for their work			2
' any arrangement that does n't acknowledge that principle is a bad one , and needs to be changed			0
that is our whole argument			0
' @entity8 's award - winning @entity11 trilogy includes @entity78 and the @entity79 the society , which was founded in 1884 and has more than 9,000 members , says publishers must reimburse writers who have been underpaid , with interest on what they are owed , and ensure that publishing contracts are correctly interpreted so writers are paid what they are due in future			1
it also wants the government to ensure e-books are covered by the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) scheme			0
in a report out today , the society says most authors - for whom the average wage is £ 12,000 - already ' struggle to make ends meet ' , adding : ' advances have fallen while more unpaid work is expected of authors in marketing and publicising their work , including appearances and use of social media			1
' the report adds : ' @entity94 provides a significant and much - valued part of many authors ' incomes ... it amounts to a total of around £ 6m per year			0
' @entity116 , chairman of the society 's management committee , said : ' authors are keen to embrace the opportunities offered by digital publishing and want to support libraries by offering their ebooks for lending			0
' however , we need to ensure that authors are paid sufficient money from digital to enable them to keep writing			2

his @entity140 author says if not , many will be forced to give up writing
