with as many as nine different bins and boxes , it is no wonder some of us find recycling fairly confusing			1
but now councils have found a way of shaming those who sort their waste incorrectly – attaching red tags to the offending containers			0
in a pilot scheme , those who put , for example , a margarine pot in a bin meant for plastic bottles , will find that instead of emptying it , waste collectors will attach a red label saying ‘ wrong stuff , wrong bin ’			0
confusing : residents who do not recycle correctly will not have the offending waste collected ( file photo ) binmen will also be issued with green ‘ right stuff , right bin ’ tags for containers that are correctly filled			0
yoghurt pots , plastic food trays and carrier bags are among the items most often placed in the wrong bin			0
one area adopting the scheme is @entity36			1
councillor @entity37 , the @entity39 authority 's cabinet member for waste , recycling and housing , said : ' a large number of people in the borough already work hard at recycling most of their waste			1
' however , some people still struggle to identify the correct items for each bin and this could be for a number of reasons			0
' it is always good to try new ideas to raise the level of recycling , which in turn saves the town money			1
i hope people will get involved with this new initiative which should make a difference			0
' @entity64 collection : residents in @entity66 already have to sort their waste into four wheelie bins ( file photo ) residents already have to sort their waste into four wheelie bins , and under the pilot scheme - operating in the @entity66 area - if they dispose of an item in the wrong one , it will be left unemptied			2
@entity74 , @entity64 campaign is being introduced into other areas of @entity77 , all chosen for their poor recycling record , and is intended as a short - term measure in conjunction with an information campaign			1
an initial pilot in nearby @entity84 increased recycling by 56 per cent and reduced cross-contamination by 61 per cent			2
the scheme is funded by @entity88 which said the region 's 42 per cent recycling rate cost residents £ 25million a year which would be better spent on schools and community projects			1
last week it emerged that @entity97 council in @entity98 is proposing to cut its rubbish collection to once every three weeks , to the fury of some residents .			2

@entity103 piloted in parts of @entity77 with poor recycling rates
labour council *leaders* in @entity36 said it was ' good to try new ideas '
it is *claimed* poor recycling costs the area £ 25million a year
