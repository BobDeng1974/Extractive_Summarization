defiant : prime minister @entity0 insisted he would continue with plans to reduce the deficit in spite of a huge spike in the number of people unemployed the young , women working part - time and the elderly yesterday emerged as the main victims as the worst unemployment figures for 17 years were announced			1
between june and august the total number of unemployed people rocketed by 114,000 – equal to about 8,800 jobs being lost every week – leaving 2.56million people out of work			1
as the total climbed to its highest level since 1994 , in those few months a record 74,000 over- 65s were pushed out of work – just weeks before new retirement rules came into force on october 1 which ban employers from getting rid of workers because of their age			2
youth unemployment also rose by 74,000 to a record 991,000 , raising fears it could breach the one million mark within months			1
this leaves more than one in five 16 to 24 year olds out of work			1
part - time posts also fell by a record 175,000 in the three months to august , which has pushed unemployment rates for women up to record levels			1
during bitter exchanges in the @entity41 yesterday , prime minister @entity0 admitted that the figures from the @entity43 were ‘ very disappointing ’ , adding that the government has to ‘ do more to get our economy moving ’			1
but he insisted the @entity47 ’s deficit reduction plans must not be abandoned , arguing that a u-turn would send interest rates soaring and the economy ‘ into a tailspin ’			0
@entity52 said the figures were ‘ a day of judgment ’ and called for a new economic plan to kickstart growth			0
concerns at the increasing number of young people unable to get a job led @entity61 , an economist from the investment bank @entity62 , to say there is a ‘ strong need ’ for direct measures to encourage firms to take them on			2
worrying trend : young people queue outside a job centre in a stunt to publicise the record level of youth unemployment these include lowering national insurance rates or cutting the national minimum wage , which was recently increased by 15p to £ 6.08 an hour for those aged 21 and above and raised 6p to £ 4.98 per hour for 18 to 20 year olds			1
@entity77 , of @entity78 , added : ‘ the number of unemployed young people is now almost twice the population of @entity82			2
if we fail to tackle youth unemployment now we risk losing this talent forever , which would be a tragedy			2
’ @entity86 , founder of @entity87 , a job - hunting website , said : ‘ every day i hear from young people who are desperately struggling to find work			1
most are searching high and low and would take anything they were offered			0
more often than not , employers do n’t even bother to write and tell them they have n’t got the job			0
’ experts also raised fears that bosses employed a policy of ‘ clearing the decks ’ ahead of new retirement rules			0
before october 1 , a boss could simply tell a worker to leave when he or she reached retirement age , a practice which has now been banned			0
@entity106 of @entity107 , a group which campaigns for the rights of older workers , said the figures raise ‘ serious questions ’ for the government about the rule change			2
he added : ‘ has the scrapping of the default retirement age prompted employers to clear the decks ahead of the october milestone , denying older people the chance to work and save for longer ? ’ for those who have survived the recession , the figures show that the average private sector worker got a rise of just 1.8 per cent which , with inflation at 4.5 per cent , is the equivalent of a pay cut			1
the @entity128 warned yesterday that unemployment will keep on rising			0
@entity130 , general secretary of the @entity132 union , said : ' the @entity133 and @entity135 ' big gamble that private sector growth would create enough jobs to compensate for their cuts in public sector jobs has not come off , as the rise to 2.57 million without jobs shows			0
' in the middle of the worst international recession for 80 years , the government itself is creating unemployment , with 250,000 public sector posts already gone and still more to come			2
' these posts could have been available to the 2.57 million workers now facing the despair of mass unemployment			0
' government policy is hurting but it 's not working			2
the squandering of human talent through unemployment is a crime that will haunt future generations			0
' employment minister @entity158 said : ' it is clear that we are seeing the effect of the international economic crisis on the @entity164 labour market			0
' that 's why last week we announced the right - to - buy housing scheme to support growth and today we are offering more support for jobseekers as sector - based work academies come on stream , combining real training , work experience and a guaranteed interview			1
' our new @entity175 is now up and running and offers people who have lost their jobs flexible , tailored support to get back into jobs and stay there			0
' the government said it was taking steps to support growth and rebalance the economy , including the creation of 11 new enterprise zones , designed to boost local growth and create more than 30,000 new jobs by 2015 , four annual reductions in corporation tax , cutting the small companies rate , expanding loan guarantees and investing in science and apprenticeships			0
other figures showed that the number of people classed as economically inactive increased by 26,000 to 9.35 million , a rate of 23.3 per cent			1
taking the inactivity rate and the new jobless figures together , half of 16 to 24 - year - olds are now not employed , it was revealed .			1

*8.1* per cent of working population is without a job
991,000 16 to 24 - year - olds out of work
number claiming @entity211 tops 1.6m
*150,000* people made *redundant* in last three months

@entity0 said the unemployment figures were ' very disappointing '
