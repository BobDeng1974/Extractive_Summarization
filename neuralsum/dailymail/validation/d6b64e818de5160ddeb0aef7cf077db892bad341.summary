in 2001 , then - @entity1 mayor @entity0 said @entity2 was like a brother to him , at the police commissioner 's @entity5 retirement ceremony			1
but just five years later , as he was accused of ethics violations and conspiracy charges , @entity2 learned that @entity0 's friendship was anything but as strong as blood			2
in his new memoir from @entity13 to jailed , due out tuesday and excerpted in the @entity14 , @entity2 details his fall from grace and how @entity0 cut ties not only with him , but with his wife and daughters - one of whom is @entity0 's goddaughter			1
from friends to strangers : disgraced for @entity1 police commissioner @entity2 says @entity24 mayor @entity0 abandoned him and his family once he was hit with legal woes in the mid- 2000s			1
the two pictured above on @entity27 following 9/11 ( @entity2 on the left , @entity0 on the right ) abandoning his own goddaughter : @entity2 says @entity0 completely cut ties not only with him but with his family , including his daughter @entity33 who is @entity0 's goddaughter			1
@entity2 pictured above with his family in @entity1 in december 2006			2
in the photo , @entity2 holds daughter @entity36 , with his arm around daughter @entity33 , next to wife @entity38 when the first accusations against @entity2 were lodged in 2006 , his old pal @entity0 was gearing up for the 2008 presidential election and the two appeared to still be close			1
but in june of that year , @entity2 went from being a 9/11 hero to a corrupt city official on the cover of tabloids when the @entity48 's @entity47 hit him with two ethics code violations - one for not disclosing a personal loan on his conflict - of - interest report and the other for accepting renovations on his home from a @entity56 company vying for city work			2
it was in november that @entity2 first started to feel the cold shoulder from the @entity0 camp			2
writer : in his memoir from @entity13 to jailed ( cover , left ) , due out tuesday , @entity2 details how he sent @entity0 a @entity65 statue ( stock image right ) for @entity67 in 2006 and had the gift sent back with no explanation @entity2 says he was sitting in his office one day when his then 6 - year - old daughter @entity33 came in and asked to send her godfather a present - one befitting a possible future president of the @entity74			1
' given that my daughter @entity33 was only six years old at the time , she had no idea of the difference between a @entity80 and a @entity81			2
all she knew was that people were saying that her godfather was going to be the next president of the @entity74			0
disgraced : @entity2 was sent to prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to felony tax and false statement charges			1
pictured above at a press conference in november 2007 ' she was talking about it twenty - four hours a day , as if that were the only thing going on in her little world			0
she had no idea of what this really meant , of course , but she was convinced that @entity0 was going to be president , ' @entity2 writes			0
remembering a previous visit to the @entity99 to meet president @entity100 , @entity33 asked to give her godfather a @entity65 statue - just like the one she saw in @entity102 during her visit			0
the two picked out a statuette and sent it to @entity0 with a handmade card from @entity33 ahead of @entity2 's out - of - town trip to @entity108			1
by the time he returned though , @entity2 was having a hard time getting in contact with @entity0			0
@entity2 had promised his daughter that they could see her godfather during their annual holiday - time stay in @entity1 and when @entity0 did n't return his calls , @entity2 ' did n't have the hard to tell @entity33 '			1
@entity2 fully got the message when soon after he found a box containing the statue returned to his front step			0
' i just did n’t understand it			0
what bothered me more than anything was that whoever sent it back took the girls ’ card and did n’t have the courtesy to send a note back with the box , ' @entity2 recalls			0
what 's more - @entity0 failed to send his daughters birthday or @entity67 cards like he did every year - and they have n't received one since			0
the next year , @entity2 was hit with even more allegations - this time for conspiracy , tax fraud and making false statements during his @entity140 appointment			2
in 2009 , he pleaded guilty to eight felony tax and false statement charges and was sent to the minimum - security prison camp in @entity144 , @entity145 on may 17 , 2010 - where he spent the next nearly three years			1
@entity2 says what bothers him most about his sudden estrangement from @entity0 , is the fact that the former @entity1 mayor abandoned his wife and daughter when they needed his support the most			1
' during my time in @entity144 , @entity0 never once called @entity38 [ @entity2 's wife ] to speak with the girls			2
he never tried calling any mutual friend of ours to check up on them , ask how they were doing			0
there were no @entity67 or birthday cards			0
' my safe guess is that as a former @entity74 attorney @entity0 had a sense of what the separation of incarceration does to families — yet not once did he call to help in any way , ' @entity2 writes			0
before he was jailed , @entity2 held positions as the corrections commissioner of @entity1 , @entity1 police commissioner and interim @entity174 minister of the interior			1
@entity0 ran as a @entity81 in the 2008 presidential primary but lost the party nomination to @entity179 senator @entity178 .			0

@entity2 was imprisoned for three years in 2010 when he pleaded guilty to felony tax and false statement charges
the former @entity1 police commissioner , who served during 9/11 , was once as close as family with *ex-mayor* @entity0
but when he was first hit with accusations in 2006 , he says the then - presidential *hopeful* stopped talking to him
in his new memoir due out tuesday , @entity2 says @entity0 also abandoned his goddaughter , @entity2 's daughter @entity33
