by @entity0 most people would go to great lengths to avoid being bitten by bedbugs			0
not so for one @entity5 insect expert who decided to allow 1,000 of the creatures to give him a temporary ' tattoo '			1
@entity8 allowed the bedbugs to feast on his arm in a bid to see what would happen to his skin			1
he then placed his arm over the mouth of the jar and allowed the creatures to bite him , io9.com reports			1
the colony of bedbugs was being kept to train a bed bug sniffing dog - @entity33 the beagle - to find them in hotel rooms			0
mr @entity8 said while it was not painful he could feel the bugs biting him			1
as they were feeding on his arm he could see them in the jar swelling up and turning red as they filled up with his blood			2
two hours after the experiment , he was left with a neat red rabbit - shaped mark on his arm			1
after 24 hours the whole area had turned an angry red and the rabbit was no longer visible			2
at this point , his arm was also very swollen and itchy			2
about 24 hours after the experiment , the area was red , swollen and itchy and the rabbit was not visible mr @entity8 then developed a series of blisters where he had been bitten by the bedbugs some 72 hours after the experiment , the rabbit - shape mark had returned and the blisters had gone down he then developed a number of blisters which he says are an atypical response to bedbug bites - he says people who are bitten once or twice will not usually develop blisters but that having hundreds attack you can lead to pus - filled lumps			1
by 72 hours after the experiment , the neat rabbit tattoo had returned			0
two weeks later the mark had almost entirely disappeared			2
bedbugs are small blood - sucking insects that can live in the cracks and crevices around a bed			0
they are attracted by body heat and crawl out at night to bite people and feed on their blood			0
some people develop no signs of the bites at all while others develop itchy red bumps			0
they are not dangerous and they do not transmit any human diseases .			0

@entity8 *wanted* to discover what the bugs would do to his skin
insect expert placed a rabbit - shaped stencil over an open jar full of bugs
he then placed his arm over the stencil and allowed the bugs to bite him
this left him with a red , itchy , rabbit - shaped mark for almost two weeks
