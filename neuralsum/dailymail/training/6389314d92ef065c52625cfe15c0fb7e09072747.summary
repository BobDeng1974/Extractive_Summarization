@entity2 , 16 , appeared noticeably nervous around the camera as she made an appearance saturday at a car wash organized in her hometown of @entity15 , @entity16 , by her high school friends to raise money to help her cope with her ordeal			1
her father revealed that ' ever moment ' is a struggle for the girl , who was rescued just last week from 40 - year - old @entity2 , who kidnapped her and took her 1,000 miles from her home to the @entity24 wilderness			2
she said she wanted to thank everyone was who helping her @entity2 's watchful father @entity32 stands by his daughter as she mingles with her high school friends , who are raising money to help support her her appearance was brief and it was clear that she was n't entirely comfortable being followed by the camera from @entity37			1
however , she did offer thanks to her supporters when asked when asked by @entity37 if she had any words for her friends and supporters in the community she responded : ' just , thank you			0
' her father told the tv station that his daughter is still learning to cope with the trauma she endured			0
' right now , she just wanted to come out and thank these people personally , ' @entity46 said			0
' it 's very difficult			0
every moment is difficult for her			0
' police said they consider @entity2 ' a victim of every sense of the word ' after she was rescued last week from an encampment in the remote @entity55 in @entity24 after @entity57 agents shot dead her captor - 40 - year - old @entity2			1
@entity2 was a trusted family friend , who @entity2 and her eight - year - old brother @entity58 referred to as ' @entity59			2
' police say he lured @entity2 's mother @entity62 and her brother @entity58 to his home and then bound , tortured and killed them			1
he then shot the family dog before burning his house down			2
on friday , sheriff 's spokeswoman @entity68 reiterated previous statements made by sheriff @entity71 , who unequivocally said that @entity2 ‘ was not a willing participant			1
' @entity74 = { } ; @entity76 = @entity75 ( @entity77 ( ) * 10000 ) ; @entity78 = @entity79 ( window.location.href ) ; @entity80 = @entity79 ( window.location.host ) ; @entity81 = 652 ; @entity82 = 367 ; @entity83 = " 220059881 " ; @entity84 = " @entity89 " ; @entity85 = " @entity90 " ; @entity86 = " @entity90 " ; @entity87 = @entity88 ( " @entity91 " ) ; @entity92 = " none " ; @entity94 = @entity95 ; @entity96 = @entity82 ; @entity97 = " no " ; @entity98 = " @entity99 ; murdered : @entity2 's mother @entity62 and eight - year - old brother @entity58 were tortured to death and murdered by @entity2 's kidnapper @entity2 @entity2 was spotted sneaking into a fundraiser being held for her dead relatives on thursday make way : the 16 - year - old was ushered into a back door of the @entity15 , @entity16 restaurant where community members had gathered to help raise money for funeral costs suddenly silent : @entity2 did not speak on thursday and she has set all of her social media accounts to private ‘ as sheriff @entity71 said earlier in the week , @entity2 is a victim in every sense of the word , ’ @entity68 said in an email to the @entity116			1
‘ our follow - up investigation has not changed that sentence			0
’ on thursday , @entity46 stepped out in public for the first time since she was rescued by federal agents less than a week ago			1
the 16 - year - old wore sunglasses , a blue top and short jean shorts as she attended a fundraiser with friends and supporters in @entity15 , @entity16 less than a week after her ordeal ended			0
it comes as questions remain over what exactly happened when she was kidnapped by @entity137 , a family friend who killed her mother and 8 - year - old brother before abducting her and taking her to @entity24 where @entity57 officers shot him dead			2
many questions remain about the timeline of events on the day when @entity144 and @entity145 were killed : why did @entity2 exchange 13 calls with @entity2 in the hours leading up to the attack ? how exactly were they killed ? and how was @entity2 able to restrain and kill them without @entity2 knowing before they drove off together ? police have not explained any of these issues publicly , but they have released the search warrants filled out by investigators at @entity2 's house , listing pages of evidence that they took with them to help piece together his relationship to the @entity162 - and @entity2 in particular			1
@entity163 county sheriff @entity71 has been adamant that @entity2 was an unwilling victim from start to finish			2
" i ca n't make it any clearer , " he said at a news conference monday			0
she has spoken to friends and strangers over social media and released a number of pictures of herself via her @entity174 account but the first time she was seen publicly came thursday evening when she went to a fundraiser for her family			0
her mother @entity144 and 6 - year - old brother @entity58 were killed and their bodies were set on fire by their family friend @entity183 , who ' tricked ' them into coming to his home and then killed the mother and brother before running off with @entity2 and being shot dead six days later			1
@entity2 was only briefly seen walking from their car into the back entrance of a @entity163 restaurant where the fundraiser was being held			2
support : her father said that she is happy to be home and among friends @entity2 's appearance at the fundraiser comes the same day as a growing list of evidence recovered at @entity2 's house has been revealed , including firebombs , military assault rifle ammunition , and handwritten ' letters from @entity205 ' to @entity2			1
one of the most puzzling pieces added to the ongoing investigation into this crime is that a dna test kit was found in the burnt out car that once belonged to @entity211			1
@entity212 reports that other items listed in the search warrants released today include ' crow bars and other weapons , instruments and objects capable of inflicting blunt force trauma ' , as well as bomb - making materials like gas cans , various types of duct tape and arson wire			1
a number of personal items that could potentially be used for dna collection were also gathered , including clothing and toothbrushes but also used condoms			0
the meaning behind the items was not listed , as emergency responders appear to have grabbed as many items as possible on august 5 as they tried to get a better idea of @entity2 's relationship with @entity2 as they were missing			1
what remained : firefighters found the bodies of @entity144 and @entity145 covered with tarp , showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down @entity183 's @entity242 ( pictured ) the 13 calls between @entity2 and @entity2 on the day of her abduction remain curious , though @entity246 's spokeswoman @entity68 said that they may have been discussing what time she needed to be picked up from cheerleading practice			1
today , @entity2 did not make a statement to the awaiting press , but her father @entity46 came outside and made a statement , saying that his daughter was happy to be home			2
' she 's with her family and of course with some friends and she 's just happy to be here , ' he said thursday			0
' @entity2 sends her love and she keeps moving day by day			2
' the fundraiser was largely attended by relatives and friends within their neighborhood , and mr @entity46 cited their strong support as helping them through			0
' this is a small community that we 're a part of and they really came together ... this is how @entity15 rolls , ' he said			0
he also said that he has spoken with the four horseback riders who spotted @entity2 in the @entity24 woods with @entity2 and called police			0
' it was a chance encounter but it did save my daughter 's life , ' he said			0
@entity278 turned spokesman : @entity46 stepped outside and said a few words , telling how he was so thankful for the national support that helped lead to his daughter 's rescue spreading the love : @entity32 said he spoke with the four horsemen who spotted @entity2 with @entity2 and called police , leading to her recovery the fundraiser came the day after a search warrant revealed that @entity2 's mother and brother were both killed and tortured before @entity2 's cabin set on fire			1
a police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about @entity2 's cabin being burnt to ashes in @entity242 , @entity16 on august 5th			1
they found the bodies covered with tarp , and a crowbar lying next to @entity144			0
when the responders went to the garage to check for more victims , they found the @entity46 's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head			0
the details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant , but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there - and that there was blood coming from the dog 's head - implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home .			0

abduction victim was seen attending a fundraiser for her family , making it her first public outing since being freed less than a week ago
comes the same day as new search warrants made public that list piles of evidence that the first responders collected at @entity2 's burnt house
' @entity340 ' among the evidence at her kidnapper 's house , along with ' possible blunt force weapons ' and bomb making materials
@entity2 's mother @entity144 had a dna test in her burnt car , raising more questions about their relationship
