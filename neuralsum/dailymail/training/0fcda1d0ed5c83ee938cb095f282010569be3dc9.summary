' he said : ' she feels very happy with her new life			2
she 's remarried and re-located			2
we feel like it 's just a real blessing			1
' he explained that the family 's main focus has been on protecting and shielding @entity34 and @entity35 's daughter , @entity33 , now 8 , from the details of the case as played out in @entity38 across the past two weeks			1
blessing : @entity46 and her husband @entity47 posted this picture on social media from their wedding			2
her father says her family feels that the marriage is ' a real blessing ' remembered : @entity1 , his wife @entity34 and their daughter @entity33 in the picture they used on the program for his funeral neither @entity34 nor her parents , @entity17 and @entity62 , were present at the trial			1
mr @entity17 said he ' did n't see that it would serve any purpose ' for them to be there			0
he said : ' there are two kiddos to think about now			0
we know we ca n't shield her forever			0
the truth will become apparent in time but for now she knows her daddy is gone and he 's in heaven and we just want to protect her as much as possible			0
' @entity34 , now 36 , was just 22 when she married @entity35 , then 23			2
five years later their daughter , @entity33 , was born			0
the day before he died @entity1 told his parents that his life was ' scary good			1
' he had a good job ; @entity34 – then a principal at @entity83 in @entity84 – had a good job			2
life , he said , was ' awesome			0
' then , a few minutes at @entity8 shooting range , where @entity2 and @entity1 had taken former @entity90 to help the @entity92 sufferer assimilate to civilian life , destroyed everything			1
it is testament to her strength of spirit that @entity34 has managed to rebuild and find a new life and a new love in @entity101 whom she married last summer			1
he joined @entity104 and @entity105 in 2010 and is responsible for liaison with other law - enforcement agencies in the counties			0
last march ranger @entity14 was honored by the @entity3 attorney 's office in @entity112			2
he was awarded for his investigative assistance in a multi-agency investigation that began as a kidnapping / barricaded subject			0
a resultant search warrant revealed a street sweeper destructive device , 12 firearms , hundreds of rounds of ammunition , rifle magazines , marijuana , surveillance cameras and $ 150,000 in cash			0
@entity14 is a @entity15 ranger according to mr @entity17 the end of @entity10 's trial and his conviction is another vital step in the healing process and in moving forward with their new lives as a couple and a family			1
he said : ' we feel that the jury was just			0
i mean the guy admitted to doing it and it just came down to what to do with him			0
' you know at one time he seemed to be teetering [ between sanity and insanity ]			0
is that cured ? probably not			0
but we do what the law says and we put him in jail and we keep him there			0
i do n't know if that 's good or bad or indifferent			0
' unlike @entity156 , whose life has been focused on promoting her late husband 's memory through public speaking , book tours and supporting @entity163 's biopic ' @entity3 sniper ' by attending the @entity164 , @entity34 has chosen a different path			1
according to her father : ' @entity34 's the direct opposite of @entity168 in personality and i 'm not kicking @entity170			1
@entity170 's a tough old girl			0
i 'm sure she went through some pretty gut wrenching feelings every time @entity2 was deployed and she 's very very tough			2
friends : @entity1 ( right ) and @entity2 ( left ) had met as soccer dads			1
@entity1 and @entity2 both wanted to help veterans , leading to their fatal meeting with @entity10 proud : @entity34 and @entity14 welcomed their first son , @entity16 , with this message on social media victim : famed @entity184 sniper @entity2 , pictured with his wife @entity170 , was also shot dead by @entity10			1
the two men had taken @entity10 to a shooting range to help him with his ptsd when they were killed guilty : @entity10 , 27 , was convicted of capital murder by a jury in @entity15 after just two hours of deliberations on tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole ' but i hope for her that now this is over she can back off and get her life to calm down some			1
' mr @entity17 expressed a hope that all the families involved might now find a way towards some sort of peace			0
he said : ' i hope everybody can move forward – the @entity205 , the @entity206 and even @entity10 's family because he 's got parents and relatives too			1
i ca n't imagine how they feel			0
' they 've got to live with it for the rest of their lives just like the rest of us have to live with our loss all because of the actions of one guy			0
we 're just so grateful for the blessings that @entity34 has found			2
' the @entity2 and @entity224 families have both given their blessing to the passing of a bill that will see a stretch of highway named after @entity2 , 38 , and @entity1 , 35			1
@entity9 can reveal that the families have been assured by senate representatives that the @entity15 84th @entity231 currently sitting will push through the necessary bill			1
the move comes as an online petition to have the stretch of @entity237 , which runs through the men 's hometown of @entity84 , named in their honor has gained close to its target 7,500 signatures			2
@entity156 gave her blessing to the motion last month with the @entity1 family joining her in support shortly before the trial began			1
a previous attempt to have the highway renamed in march 2013 was unsuccessful			0
but the publicity surrounding @entity10 's trial and the release of @entity163 's @entity164 - winning biopic , ' @entity2 , ' has seen a surge of support for the motion			1
speaking to @entity9 @entity258 revealed : ' there had been talk of naming a school after them but a highway seems more fitting to me			2
schools can come and go but that road will always be there in their honor			0
