by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 2 april 2013 temperatures may be yet to hit double figures this april but @entity4 blogger @entity3 has already left winter behind			1
she optimistically dedicates this week 's ten reasons why to the new season with her latest post , @entity8			1
a tough topic to sell in given the freezing temperatures outside , she enlists the help of handsome @entity16 @entity15 @entity14 presenter @entity13 , 30 , to play her pretend boyfriend			1
in the new offering @entity3 , from @entity18 , outlines such springtime benefits as women starting to wear less clothes ( ' you will enjoy this is you are a man or lesbian ' ) , and the fact that we can eat copious amounts of chocolate at @entity30			1
' for those of you watching that live in the @entity48 you now that we have n't seen spring yet			2
' @entity3 and @entity13 's role play involves the couple , kitted out in bikinis , beach shorts and sunglasses , leaving the house to go to the beach			1
however upon being hit by the reality of the temperatures @entity13 seizes up in shock and @entity3 demands : ' it 's freezing , can we go inside ? ' reason two is the fact that women start wearing less clothes - one to be enjoyed ' if you are a man or lesbian '			1
other reasons include the fact that feet are liberated : you can ' finally get out those sandals out and let your feet breathe '			2
this point is illustrated by @entity13 appearing in the sitting room ready for an outing wearing bright white socks and flip flops together			1
upon being hit by the temperatures @entity13 seizes up in shock and @entity3 demands : ' can we go inside ! ' reason two , the fact that women start wearing less clothes , is one to be enjoyed ' if you are a man or lesbian ' @entity13 , whose feet are free , wears white socks and flip flops together , but think his jeans are n't quite right @entity3 gives him a horrified , confused look , and @entity13 responds : ' it 's the jeans is n't it ? '			1
next , and this is arguably the most convincing of all , is the fact that those of us who celebrate @entity30 spend the entire time ' ramming as much chocolate down our throats as possible '			2
to illustrate the point , @entity13 and @entity3 gorge on chocolate eggs in front of the television , hiding away and even in bed			1
and as many of us return to work after a chilly @entity30 weekend chomping chocolate , that 's one element of spring we can relate to			2
