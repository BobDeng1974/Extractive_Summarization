@entity2 's flying ability was called into question in an official report following his first aviation crash , @entity0 can reveal			1
the @entity7 star , who was rushed to hospital after crashing a vintage plane in @entity10 , @entity11 on thursday , also slammed a helicopter into a riverbed back in 1999			1
it is not believed that @entity15 , 72 , is to blame for his latest - and what is his third - aviation incident at @entity19 near @entity20 , with early reports suggesting engine failure is at fault			1
but an official report into @entity15 's october 1999 accident , obtained by @entity0 , reveals it was caused by ' the pilot 's delay in adding power during a power - on recovery '			1
@entity2 had flown the helicopter from @entity31 in @entity32 45 miles northwest towards @entity33 when he hit trouble			1
@entity42 , an aerial view of the crash rescue : @entity2 is treated at the scene of his crash in @entity10 , @entity11 , yesterday the pilot was practicing autorotations to a power - on recovery			1
when he attempted to recover the power , the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter landed hard , hitting on the rear heels of both skids			2
the flight instructor said that when he saw the pilot was late adding power , he attempted to correct the situation but was unsuccessful			1
the surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand			0
the left skid heel contacted a log that was embedded in the sand and the helicopter pitched forward onto the skid toes and rolled over onto its left side			0
the @entity68 determines the probable cause ( s ) of this accident as follows : the pilot 's delay in adding power during a power - on recovery from an autorotation , which resulted in a hard landing and rollover			1
the flight instructor 's inadequate supervision of the flight was also causal			0
source : @entity68 @entity15 was practicing ' auto rotations ' - an emergency landing technique that simulates engine failure			1
he had completed one ' auto - rotation ' but on his second he was ' late bringing in the power ' , according to the documents			2
as a result , when @entity2 attempted to recover , the helicopter engine did not respond quickly enough and the aircraft began plummeting to the ground			0
the unidentified flying instructor who was aboard with the actor was forced to take over the controls and try to level the helicopter but he was unable to do so and the aircraft came crashing down into the @entity99 riverbed near @entity33 and flipped over			1
luckily @entity15 , and the unnamed instructor , were unharmed in the crash but the helicopter was ' substantially damaged ' , according to the document			2
coincidentally the helicopter was registered to @entity105 â€“ the same firm to which the 1942 vintage plane involved in @entity15 's latest crash is registered to			1
the official report , which does not name @entity15 or his instructor , states : ' on october 23 , 1999 , at 1115 hours @entity114 daylight time , a @entity111 , @entity112 , landed hard and rolled over in the @entity99 riverbed near @entity33 , @entity11			1
' the helicopter , operated by @entity105 , @entity116 , @entity117 , under the provisions of 14 @entity119 91 , was substantially damaged			0
' the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) document goes on to say that the pilot reported that he ' successfully completed one practice autorotation and entered a second approximately 600 feet agl			2
' it adds : ' when he attempted to recover power , the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter settled hard into the soft creek bed			2
' the certified flying instructor ( @entity130 ) flying with the @entity132 legend , reported that , ' the pilot had been late bringing in the power and he had gotten on the controls during the flare to help the pilot and level the helicopter			2
' the pilot reported that when he realized there was a lack of power , he tried to push the nose over			2
' both the pilot and @entity130 applied full collective , and reported that there was not sufficient rotor rpm to effectively cushion the landing , causing the helicopter to land on the heels of both skids			2
' the surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand ; the aft end of the left skid contacted a 12 - inch - diameter log that was embedded within the riverbed			0
experienced : @entity2 at the controls of his helicopter in february last year ' the tip of the left skid nosed into the sand and the helicopter rolled over onto its left side			0
' tests carried out on the helicopter following the crash found ' no abnormalities ' in the cockpit controls , engine or other parts of the aircraft			2
the @entity68 concluded that the accident was caused by , ' the pilot 's delay in adding power during a power - on recovery from an autorotation , which resulted in a hard landing and rollover			1
' it also pointed out that ' the flight instructor 's inadequate supervision of the flight was also causal			0
' @entity15 was not named in the official report but its timing and circumstances were identical to a report at the time by the respected @entity191 that he had been involved in a helicopter crash			1
@entity15 's air mishaps did n't stop there			0
just over a year later @entity15 was involved in a second aviation incident , when he was forced to make an emergency landing at @entity198 in @entity199			0
the six - seater @entity201 aircraft was forced to land due to bad weather conditions and it clipped the runway damaging the wings			0
@entity2 played down the two incidents at the time , telling @entity206 : ' they were more misadventures of a mechanical or weather - induced type			0
' with my first helicopter , i had an issue with fuel control once , which resulted in substantial damage to the helicopter prop but no injuries to the two souls aboard			0
' @entity15 is currently being treated in hospital where he is described as being in a ' fair to moderate ' condition			0
in audio of his conversation with air traffic control moments before thursday 's crash , a calm and collected @entity15 can be heard asking for an emergency landing as his engines had failed			0
he could not make the runway at @entity20 so he chose to land the two - seater world war two - era plane on a green at @entity19			0
seasoned aviator : @entity2 , who has been flying planes since the 1960s , was the only person in the plane at the time of the crash @entity2 crashed into the @entity19 golf course ( left ) after appearing to veer off course from the runway ( right ) in order to avoid homes in between witnesses described how the veteran actor was bleeding profusely from his face and he was rushed to hospital in a ' critical ' condition but this was soon downgraded			1
his son @entity249 tweeted that he was ' battered , but ok '			0
fellow aviators have come out in praise of the star for managing to navigate the vintage plane away from the nearby residential area and on to an empty part of the golf course , with one experienced pilot stating ' everything he did was perfect ' .			1

movie star , 72 , has been hailed a hero in his latest plane crash when his vintage plane came down on a golf course in @entity10 , @entity11
he has crashed before and in 1999 his helicopter flipped and slammed into river bed near @entity33 , north - east of @entity32
@entity68 report at the time found that evidence of ' pilot 's delay in adding power '
