president @entity0 said monday that @entity1 might join @entity2 as a second rogue state to enjoy normalized diplomatic relations with the @entity5 under his administration			1
in a 40 - minute interview with @entity8 conducted on december 18 – but held back for 11 days – the radio network 's senior morning host quizzed @entity0 in the @entity11 about a wide range of policy positions , including his plans for the @entity15			1
' is there any scenario under which you can envision , in your final two years , opening a @entity5 embassy in @entity20 ? ' asked @entity8 's @entity21			2
' i never say never , ' @entity0 replied , while allowing that ' i think these things have to go in steps			2
fifty - two @entity5 , mostly diplomatic personnel , were taken hostage in november of that year and held for 444 days but a group of student revolutionaries			2
in @entity1 the event is still celebrated as the ' @entity46 ' few observers believe @entity1 is interested in proving its stated intentions to abandon its nuclear - weapons ambitions by the time @entity0 leaves office in january 2017			1
but the president believes there 's a chance			0
' we have to get this nuclear issue resolved – and there 's a chance to do it , ' he said , ' and the question 's going to be whether or not @entity1 is willing to seize it			1
' if the country 's anti-america hardliners yield to more moderate voices , he predicted , ' there 's incredible talent and resources and sophistication inside of @entity1 , and it would be a very successful regional power that was also abiding by international norms and international rules , and that would be good for everybody			1
' ' that would be good for the @entity5 , that would be good for the region , and most of all , it would be good for the @entity1 people			0
' @entity0 shocked the world – and angered @entity5 's @entity2 emigres – with a december 17 announcement that he would re-establish formal ties with the @entity81 regime in @entity82			1
but speaking to npr eleven days ago , he painted @entity1 differently – noting that a more recent history of aggression makes @entity5 - @entity1 relations ' different from the history between us and @entity2			1
' ' and the strategic importance of @entity20 is – or @entity1 – is different from what we face with @entity2			1
' the @entity93 republic , he reminded @entity21 , ' has a track record of state - sponsored terrorism , that we know was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon			0
' but in the same breath @entity0 said ' @entity20 is a large , sophisticated country			2
' @entity20 is @entity1 's capital city			1
not the same thing : @entity0 insisted that ' the strategic importance of ... @entity1 is different from what we face with @entity2 ' @entity105 : @entity1 supreme leader @entity106 ( center ) and the @entity109 's political class will gain global clout from @entity0 's pronouncement that lapse aside , @entity0 emphasized monday a theme that he has grappled with since the heady days of his first presidential campaign : the prospect of changing the global diplomatic map by bringing unfriendly nations under @entity5 's wing			1
' i was asked very early in my presidential race back in 2007 – would i meet with these various rogue regimes ? ' he recalled			0
' and what i said then remains true : if i thought it advances @entity5 interests , yes			0
i believe in diplomacy , i believe in dialogue , i believe in engagement			0
' he also claimed credit for what he characterized as a realignment of global attitudes toward @entity1 ' when i came into office , the world was divided and @entity1 was in the driver 's seat , ' @entity0 said			1
but through economic sanctions , ' now the world 's united because of the actions we 've taken , and @entity1 's the one that 's isolated			1
' ' i mean , there 's a reason why we 've been able to get this far in the negotiations , ' he said : ' we mobilized the international community at the start of my presidency – a classic example of @entity5 leadership			0
' but @entity1 's supreme religious authorities , who run the country despite the fig leaf of a constitutional government , has ' a path to break through that isolation , ' @entity0 declared			2
' and they should seize it			0
' @entity0 drew criticism in 2008 for subtly changing his positiion on negotiating with antagonistic countries			0
speaking to an audience of @entity166 advocates in june of that year , he insisted that he had ' no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking			0
' ' but as president of the @entity5 , i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate @entity1 leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interest of the @entity5			0
' but during a debate eight months earlier he was asked whether he would be willing to meet @entity1 's leaders ' without precondition , ' during the first year of his administration			2
' i would , ' then - senator @entity0 replied			0
' and the reason is this : the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them – which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this [ @entity191 ] administration – is ridiculous			0

interview was conducted in the @entity11 the day after @entity0 said he would normalize relations with @entity2 – but held back for 11 days
embassy in @entity20 would be the first since 1979 hostage crisis , which @entity1 still celebrate as the ' @entity199 '
@entity0 said if @entity1 proves it 's not seeking nuclear weapons , it would become a ' very successful regional power '
claimed credit for isolating @entity20 through economic sanctions
