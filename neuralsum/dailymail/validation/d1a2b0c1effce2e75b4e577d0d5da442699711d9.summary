despite their creepy claws and bright yellow eyes , vampire crabs are increasingly popular pets			1
now , experts have discovered two new species of the spooky crustaceans - @entity7 dennerle and @entity9 - have been lurking in home aquariums for years			1
they traced the freshwater crabs ' origins back to their wild source - finding that they live in rivers on the island of @entity17 , @entity18			1
scientists have discovered two new species of the spooky crustaceans - @entity22 ( pictured ) and @entity9 - which are found in many home aquariums ' these crabs are kind of special because they 've been around in the pet trade for ten years , but no one knew where they come from , ' said @entity28 , a professional aquarist in @entity30 , @entity31 , who was speaking to @entity33			1
while scientists have identified a number of vampire crab species before – so called because of their yellow eyes and sometimes purple bodies – the two new species are the most common pets			1
they may appeal because of their diminutive size , measuring just one inch ( 3cm ) across			0
while scientists have identified a number of vampire crab species before – so called because of their yellow eyes and sometimes purple bodies – but the two new species are the most common pets			1
@entity45 is shown @entity47 dennerle is purple in colour with a cream patch on its back , while @entity45 has a bright orange shell and claws which stand out against the rest of its dark body , according to the study published in the @entity58			0
vampire crabs are so - called because of their spooky yellow eyes , which are the same colour as fictional vampires ' who drink the blood of animals / before being identified as new species , the two types of crabs were known to have originally come from somewhere in @entity68			2
a site selling vampire crabs says they thrive in aquariums with rocks to climb on and like to sit on @entity74			2
females dig down into sand to have their offspring and both sexes are more active in warmer water - typically between 21 ° @entity81 ( 70 ° @entity80 )			0
they are apparently easy to care for and are quite sociable , getting along well with one another and seldom fight			0
the crabs grow up to one inch wide ( 3cm ) and live for up to three years			0
@entity85 , co-author of the study from @entity87 , @entity31 , said dealers look for bright specimens in areas which may not have been explored by scientists			1
' suddenly the market is formed with some animals that no one has ever given a name , ' he said			0
@entity28 , who is from @entity96 , the fabled home of @entity97 , used contacts in the aquarium trade to find out where dealers were getting the colourful crabs from and after several false leads , found they come from @entity17			1
he suspects there are more vampire crab species to be uncovered on @entity18 's islands , because the crabs tend to stay put , meaning different species could exist in different places			2
however , while this may be exciting for scientists , there are concerns that wild populations could dwindle if too many crabs are collected for pets			2
they sell for around $ 25 ( £ 17 ) each			0
it 's hoped that commercial breeding could prevent this problem			0
the crabs are amphibious , which @entity28 thinks may explain why they are brightly coloured - because visual cues are important for communicating on land , while chemical cues reign supreme underwater			0

this image shows the bright purple colouring of @entity136 , which has striking yellow eyes like some fictional vampires - hence its nickname			0

@entity22 and @entity9 are popularly sold as pets
@entity31 *researchers* say they are both new species and come from @entity145
traced crustaceans ' origins by talking to dealers of the colourful crabs
experts think more new species of @entity155 crabs are still to be discovered
