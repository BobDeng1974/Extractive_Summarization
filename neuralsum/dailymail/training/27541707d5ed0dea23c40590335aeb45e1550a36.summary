the £ 115,000 - a - week defender said on @entity13 on @entity14 : ’ while u guys around the world are out celebrating @entity4 spare a thought for me please ... i 'll be in the team hotel sleeping ! ! # @entity20 ’			2
@entity2 , 34 , born in @entity23 , south - east @entity24 , was in the hotel ahead of @entity7 ’s 4 - 0 win over @entity27 at the @entity28 on @entity29 , in which he played 68 minutes to help keep his side top of the @entity31			1

' next time i 'll just put # joking on the end of a " joke " tweet for all the fooooooools ! do n't make me switch on u. ... i 'm here all night mugs !
