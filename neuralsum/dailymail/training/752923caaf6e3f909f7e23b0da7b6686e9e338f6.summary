for @entity1 , now 67 , life got off to a bad start			1
the sixth child of a feckless mother , he was handed over to a childless couple in @entity6 ' like a @entity8 parcel '			1
although his adoptive mother was kind to him , his scaffolder father was abusive and inflicted eye - watering violence on the child , even , on one occasion , attempting to stab him			1
but all that paled in comparison with what came next			1
aged nine , mr @entity1 fell victim to a predatory paedophile			1
survivor : @entity1 , now 67 , suffered years of vile sexual abuse at the hands of his scoutmaster in many ways , mr @entity1 's childhood was typical of the @entity6 at the time			1
' if you watch @entity27 , that sums up what it was like , ' he explains			1
' we lived in @entity32 which started in @entity33 and ended in @entity34 - that was my environment			1
handed over : his feckless mother handed him over to his adoptive parents ' like a @entity8 parcel ' ' we had a shared house with outside toilet			1
two families lived in it , one upstairs and one downstairs			1
there was no bath or shower so i was washed down in the kitchen sink			1
' the sixth child of a dozen born to a feckless woman called @entity55 , he was handed over to a couple named @entity57 and @entity58 for adoption as a baby			1
it was not a loving upbringing			1
' my adoptive mother was always working and my father did too , ' he remembers			2
' i can remember a child minder called @entity67 and the house always being very quiet			2
' although @entity57 was kind , his adoptive father , a man with ' an unpredictable and violent temper ' , would often terrify him with his rages			2
' i did n't love him and i do n't think he loved me , ' says mr @entity1			1
but for all that , he says he did at least put food on the table			2
' whatever he was , whatever he did , he always put food on the table , ' he explains			2
' i always had clothes			2
lots of kids in the @entity6 did n't even have that			2
' nevertheless , his childhood was a lonely one and mr @entity1 says he was ' a latchkey kid ' - free to come and go as he pleased			1
but while such freedom was not unusual , it proved to have devastating consequences , when , at the age of nine , mr @entity1 fell prey to a child molester			1
' i remember i liked war films as a kid , ' he says			2
' so one day , i decided i wanted to go and see a film called @entity95			2
difficult : @entity96 with his adoptive parents @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity58 had a ' violent and unpredictable ' temper ' i went in and the film was rolling			2
but the next thing i knew , this guy had come and sat next to me			2
he had his hand on my knee and it went on from there			2
' when he left the cinema , the man followed			2
unsuspecting , the trusting little boy allowed himself to be led into a nearby storeroom - and a horrific sex attack ensued			2
' i was inquisitive and followed him in there like a little sheep , ' he says ruefully			2
' i could have been a headstone by now			2
that 's how it could have ended			2
' luckily , mr @entity1 was allowed to go			1
he ran home and kept what had happened to him secret , never telling anyone what had taken place			1
lonely existence : @entity96 as a toddler			2
he says he spent much of his early years with a child minder ' at the time , i thought : " what was that ? i ca n't tell anyone "			1
i knew it was wrong			2
' heartbreakingly , he was also convinced that should his parents find out , they might blame him instead			1
' what i was most concerned about was that if i told my parents , they might be angry and maybe put me in a home			1
' i thought they might think they 'd adopted a duff one			0
so i just carried on and a year later , i joined the @entity142			0
' his decision to join the @entity142 was to prove a fateful one and what came next left him with mental scars that have lasted all his life			0
' the first thing i thought when i saw him was that he was smart , ' says mr @entity1 of the moment he was introduced to his scoutmaster , a man named @entity154			1
' he was well - presented			0
his trousers had real nice creases on the front			0
he came to the meeting because our scoutmaster was leaving			1
' in the end , it was announced that @entity163 [ former scoutmaster ] was going and @entity154 would be taking over			1
i did n't think he was good looking because he was n't			0
' the meeting , when mr @entity1 was aged 10 , signalled the start of what would turn into almost a decade of sexual abuse			1
showered with attention and affection , the lonely little boy was easily groomed and , when @entity154 offered to take him to the cinema and said he could stay the night afterwards , the relationship became a sexual one			1
unable to tell anyone , in particular his parents , mr @entity1 felt trapped and unable to sound the alarm			1
even today , he is unwilling to condemn his attacker and calls what passed between them ' conditional kindness '			0
' my father had a violent and unpredictable temper and @entity154 's place was a place of tranquillity and safety , ' he explains			0
' i felt that i was being offered something - a trade			1
i called it conditional kindness			0
' heartbreakingly , he still feels disloyal by talking about what transpired between him and @entity154			0
' i sort of feel that i 'm betraying someone who helped me , ' he admits			0
' there 's a sort of mixed feeling			0
i also feel disloyal in some way			0
' @entity198 finally came when he left the scouts aged 18 , although he reveals he had tried to escape @entity154 's attentions many times before			1
scout : james aged 10 , proudly wearing a poppy and his @entity205 's @entity204 ' i kept trying to get away , ' he says			1
' but he [ @entity154 ] would say things like , " how do you feel about going to @entity210 ? " and i 'd think , " wow , me an @entity6 boy in @entity210 ! " and then i 'd be right back in it again			0
' aged 16 , he met his first girlfriend and , determined to make it work , he tried again to make a break with his paedophile scoutmaster			1
' i tried so hard to make that break , ' he says			0
' in the end , i was too old for him			0
we became sort of friends			0
' he went on to marry his girlfriend and together , they had one child			0
but the marriage broke down when his daughter was a few months old			0
mr @entity1 , who has now been with his partner @entity228 for 30 years , says that the break - down was the result , in part , of him coming to terms with his long - suppressed homosexuality			1
' all i knew was that you had a girlfriend , got married and had a family , ' he says			0
' everything else was just with him [ @entity154 ] and not quite right			0
' but while coming to terms with being gay , which was a criminal offence until 1967 , coming to terms with his abusive childhood was even harder			0
happy moment : @entity96 with his adoptive father ( left ) and mother ( right ) at a cousin 's wedding in @entity248 ' i never told anybody			0
not once , ' he says			0
' not until i wrote the manuscript [ for his memoir ]			0
my partner was the first one to read it			1
' he took it calmly			0
he was n't disgusted and he took it all in his stride			0
we 've been together for 30 years so it was good to say what had happened			1
' telling his story : after keeping his experiences secret for more than 30 years , @entity262 is finally telling his story in the hope of helping others and as the litany of historical sex abuse cases relating to @entity268 began to emerge , mr @entity1 grew even more determined to tell his story			1
' i used to read all that and think : " that could have been me "			0
' nevertheless , he says he has no plans to take his own attackers to court and questions the motivation of some of the people who have so far come forward			0
' with @entity278 , i wonder why these people have left it so long , ' he explains			0
' if that was what they wanted , if they were so embittered , why did n't they do it before ? i think the motivation sometimes is wrong			0
now this has gone from not enough has been done to endless court cases and inquiries			0
the powers that be have gone from one extreme to another			0
' for his own part , mr @entity1 says life , his childhood apart , has treated him well			1
' i feel incredibly lucky , ' he says			0
' you 've got to be brave enough to create your own luck			0
if you sit with your bum on a sofa , nothing will happen			0
but if you get out and work , you will get that opportunity			0
i wanted to be somebody			0
i did n't want to be somebody working in a factory			0
i 've now been retired for 20 years and i 've had a great time			1
