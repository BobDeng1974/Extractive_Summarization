by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 10:22 est , 28 february 2013 a family home was left covered in tumbleweeds this week after wind storms swept through west @entity4			1
frustrated homeowner @entity5 was expecting to spend the entire week clearing away the debris , which had piled up to the roof on one side of his house			1
mr @entity5 said it was the ' most ridiculous thing ' he has ever seen , with the giant balls of dry plants also covering a large part of his garden			1
tumbleweeds can be formed by a number of plants that break away from their roots when mature and are carried by the wind			2
the plants curl into a ball when dry and uncurl when moist and are a common sight in steppe and desert areas , such as large parts of @entity4 and @entity47			2
it is because of the abundance of tumbleweeds in the more barren parts of @entity52 that they have become a symbol of isolation			0
one of most common tumbleweeds in the @entity57 is the @entity59 thistle , which is not native to @entity52			0
it was brought over by accident by migrants from the @entity63 , who settled in @entity65 in the @entity66			0
tumbleweed seeds , foliage and stems are eaten by a number of desert dwellers , including quail , ground squirrels , pocket mice , prairie dogs , kangaroo rats and mule deer			0
he also revealed the problem could have been averted , where it not for the fact that he had pulled down a fence , which would have blocked the unwelcome visitors			2
mr @entity5 said : ' you live here , the risks you take i guess			1
we 're definitely in @entity4 , where the wind blows			2
' the bizarre sight in @entity22 came on monday as 60mph winds wreaked havoc across the @entity94 area			1
emergency services were called into action as roofs were ripped off buildings and vehicles flipped onto their sides			0
mr @entity5 was alerted to the tumbleweeds on monday by his wife , who had sent her husband a text message			1
speaking at the house , mr @entity5 told @entity106 9 : ' it 's just completely covered with tumbleweeds , most ridiculous thing i 've ever seen			1
i did n't even know this many tumbleweeds existed mr @entity5 cleared the tumbleweeds by pushing them into a ditch behind his house , having been told he would have to deal with the problem on his own			1
he added : ' i called the fire department and they said that since it was on my yard , it was considered yard waste and that i had to take care of it			1
wind storms : the bizarre sight came as 60mph winds wreaked havoc across western @entity4 this week unexpected : the homeowner had knocked down a fence which would have kept the tumbleweeds out ' they or the city would n't be able to do anything			1
so i figured , i got to do what i got to do			0
' @entity19 is the name given to a number of plants which detach from their roots at maturity , and are carried by the wind			2
they form balls when they are dry and uncurl when moist			0
the plants are mostly associated with isolated desert areas of the @entity57 , largely thanks to their regular appearances in @entity145			0
but @entity52 's most common tumbleweed , the @entity59 thistle , is not native to the continent			0
it was instead brought over by accident by migrants from the @entity63 in the @entity66			0
the strong winds also brought problems in @entity154 , where a grounded helicopter was flipped upside down , while a motorist had to be freed from an overturned truck in @entity159			0
not native : the most common tumbleweeds , @entity59 thistles , were brought over in the @entity66 havoc : the strong winds in west @entity4 also caused a grounded helicopter to flip upside down			2
