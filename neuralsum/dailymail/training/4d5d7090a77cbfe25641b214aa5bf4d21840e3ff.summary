at age 12 , @entity0 suddenly turned from a healthy boy obsessed with electronics into a virtual ' vegetable ' after falling into an inexplicable comatose state			1
he would spend the next dozen years trapped inside his weakened , helpless body , unable to speak or move , with only the children 's character @entity7 to keep him company for hours on end			1
' i can not even express to you how much i hated @entity7 , ' @entity0 recalled on the first episode of @entity15 's new radio show about human behavior , @entity17			1
mystery illness : at age 12 , @entity0 , pictured here with his father , @entity20 , suddenly turned from a healthy boy into a virtual vegetable after falling into an inexplicable comatose state but according to @entity0 , it was his burning desire to get away from the affable purple dinosaur prancing with kids on the television screen in a @entity30 clinic that gave him the impetus to get better			1
in a bid to gain some control of his day , @entity0 figured a way to tell time by tracking the movement of the sun across the room			2
four years into his mystery illness , he started to regain consciousness and mobility , until eventually he learned to operate a computer to type messages and speak through a speech synthesizer			1
in 2011 , @entity0 wrote a book about his extraordinary journey , which fortunately had a happy end : he met a woman in 2008 and the two got married and moved to the @entity51 a year later			1
the same year @entity0 's autobiography , @entity53 , was released , he wrote a poignant first - person account for the @entity55 detailing his illness and remarkable recovery			1
in january 1988 , when @entity0 was 12 years old , he came home from school one day with a sore throat			1
he never returned to class			0
bittersweet memory : @entity0 , front , with his parents and siblings in the last picture before the illness struck			2
doctors were never able to accurately diagnose his condition @entity70 up : @entity0 was stuck in front of a tv set watching reruns of @entity7 ( right ) for days on end , until one day he decided he 's had enough			1
he started following the movement of the sun in the room to tell time buried alive : @entity0 recalled feeling entombed in his weak , out - of - control body , even as his mind continued to churn out thoughts that he could not communicate in the months that followed , his condition deteriorated			1
doctors were never able to conclusively pinpoint the exact cause of his ailment , but cryptococcal meningitis was the most likely culprit			1
his mobility was the first to go , followed by his memory , leaving him an empty shell of his old self			0
‘ my muscles wasted , my limbs became spastic , my hands and feet curled in on themselves like claws , ’ he wrote for @entity55			0
‘ i was completely unresponsive			0
i was in a virtual coma but the doctors could n’t diagnose what had caused it			2
’ after months of tests and doctor visits , @entity0 's parents , @entity20 and @entity101 , were told that nothing can be done for him , and that the only option was to put their son in a home and let his degenerative neurological mystery illness run its course			1
' politely but firmly the medical profession washed its hands of me			0
we were in effect told to wait until my death released us all , ' he wrote			0
in first person : in 2011 , @entity0 published his memoir @entity53 about his illness and recovery speaking to @entity15 's @entity17 from his home in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity0 said his darkest hour came when his mother entered into his room and told him , ' i hope you die			1
' @entity101 said she uttered those pitiless words thinking her vegetable - like son could not hear her			0
against all odds , @entity0 continued living			2
for the next decade , his father 's life consisted of getting up early in the morning , driving his helpless son to a special care center , then picking him up eight hours later and driving him home , where he would be bathed , fed and put to bed			2
his mother initially wanted nothing to do with @entity0 , so great was her anger and resentment brought on by seeing her once - healthy boy turn into a ' potted plant			2
' at one point during those dark days , @entity101 even tried to take her own life by overdosing on pills , but her husband was able to get her to the hospital in time			0
what @entity101 and @entity20 did not know was that about two years into their son ’s ailment , his mind ' switched on			2
' ' i began to wake up , ' @entity0 , now age 39 , told @entity15 , explaining that all of a sudden he was aware of ' everything			1
' no one around @entity0 knew that he had regained his mental faculties because he still could not move his body or express himself verbally			1
he was effectively trapped , and there was no way to escape			0
in his lengthy account from 2011 , @entity0 wrote : ‘ though my body and i were locked in an endless fight , my mind was getting stronger			1
pieces of my consciousness knitted together			0
‘ i gradually became aware of each day and each hour in it			0
most were forgettable but there were times i saw history unfold			0
@entity174 becoming president in 1994 is a hazy memory but @entity177 ’s death in 1997 is clear			0
‘ i knew who i was and where i was , and understood i ’d been robbed of a real life			0
love at first smile : in 2008 , @entity0 met a social worker named @entity182 , who said she was instantly drawn to his sense of humor ‘ i was completely entombed			2
at first i wanted to fight my fate by leaving some tiny sign to guide people back to me , like the crumbs @entity189 left to help find their way out of the woods			0
‘ have you ever seen one of those movies in which someone wakes up as a ghost but they do n’t know that they ’ve died ? that ’s how it was , as i realized people were looking through and around me			0
‘ however much i tried to beg and plead , shout and scream , i could n’t make them notice me			0
’ @entity0 recalled that while most of the staff at the special care clinic he was in were kind to him , some were callous and cruel , calling him an ' obstacle ' and ' rubbish ' to his face , not realizing that he could hear and understand ever hurtful word			2
@entity0 's first impulse was to turn off his thoughts , since he saw no point in having them in the first place			1
‘ you do n't really think about anything , ’ @entity0 said			2
it 's a very dark place to find yourself because , in a sense , you are allowing yourself to vanish			0
’ but then something changed inside him			0
after learning to tell time by the sun just so he could escape the endless @entity7 reruns on tv , @entity0 slowly regained his will to live , in part thanks to a kindly special care worker who took a genuine interest in him			0
at age 26 , @entity0 passed a test by identifying pictures of various items with his eyes			2
@entity101 , his mother , quit her job as a radiographer and spent the next two years helping @entity0 master a computer program that enabled him to communicate			1
@entity236 on @entity237 fresh start : @entity0 and @entity182 have moved to @entity121 , @entity51 , where the wheelchair - bound 39 - year - old works as a web designer sealed with a kiss : in 2009 , the couple got married.te two are shown here on their wedding day ' my feeble hands pressing one of my switches enabled me to choose a word i wanted			1
then i would click on one last symbol – ‘ speak ’ – and my electronic voice would have its say , ' he wrote in 2011			0
still wheelchair - bound and unable to speak normally , @entity0 went on to get a job at a government office			1
but he was not done yet			0
@entity0 then enrolled in a university to study computer science and eventually started his own company			1
he is now learning to drive			0
in 2008 , @entity0 's life took yet another sudden turn , only this time for the better : he met a social worker named @entity182			1
a friend of @entity0 's sister , @entity182 said she was instantly drawn to @entity0 's sense of humor			1
for @entity0 and @entity182 , it was love at first smile			0
' my face would hurt form smiling so much , ' @entity0 told @entity15 through his voice synthesizer .			2
