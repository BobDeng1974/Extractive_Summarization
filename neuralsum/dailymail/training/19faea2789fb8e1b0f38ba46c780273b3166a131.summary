@entity2 cities could be hit by rioting because of an influx of @entity6 migrants , @entity0 has warned			1
the former home secretary said ‘ frictions ’ with local people could lead racial tensions to ‘ explode ’ in a repeat of the riots that rocked @entity14 towns in the summer of 2001			2
mr @entity0 called on @entity6 migrants from @entity16 to ‘ change their culture ’ because their dumping of rubbish and refusal to send their children to school had caused ‘ understandable tensions ’ with residents in his home city of @entity27			1
a @entity29 family who told the @entity30 that they are moving to the @entity2 @entity27 citizens have already set up street patrols to combat anti-social behaviour by the @entity6			2
@entity2 is home to more than 200,000 @entity6 migrants , most of them from @entity35			1
‘ if everything exploded , if things went wrong , the community would obviously be devastated , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ we saw this is @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 all those years ago when i first became home secretary			0
if things implode it ’s not outside here that cops it , it ’s the community			0

we ’ve got to change that			0
’ mr @entity0 said locals were entitled to ‘ grumble ’ about the large influx of migrants from @entity6 communities , but they should not ‘ stir up hate ’			1
