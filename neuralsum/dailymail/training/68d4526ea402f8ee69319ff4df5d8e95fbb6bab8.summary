hundreds of pupils have been banned from class for a raft of ' sexual misconduct ' , including assault , harassment and bullying			1
others have been excluded for inappropriate touching , lewd behaviour and sexual graffiti			0
shockingly , some children were disciplined within their first year at primary school when new learners are just four or five - years - old , although 13 , 14 and 15 years old are the most likely to be punished			1
a new investigation found there were more than 2,000 reported incidents between january 2010 and september 2013 , although the true figure is likely to be much higher , as nearly two - thirds of the 153 authorities contacted said they did not hold the information centrally , or refused to disclose it			1
child welfare charities and politicians described the figures , uncovered by the @entity39 , as ' extremely concerning ' and called on the government to clamp down on the ease with which children can access internet pornography , and to implement a ' robust ' sex education programme			2
@entity45 , head of tackling child sexual abuse at the @entity47 , said : ' the extent of sexual harassment , inappropriate sexual behaviour and in the worst cases violence by children is extremely concerning			2
' exposure to extreme , sometimes sexually violent and degrading material is now only a few clicks away and this can warp young people ’s views of what is normal and acceptable sexual behaviour			0
' sexting ( sending sexual text messages ) is now the norm for many young people who may find once they start sending explicit pictures of themselves the situation spirals out of control			0
' we need good quality , age appropriate education in schools to help young people develop healthy , positive relationships with each other , so that children understand consent , do not feel so pressurised to behave in a sexualised way , and respect themselves and others			2
' six children in reception classes across @entity82 were involved in a sexual act in a school , the figures showed			2
exposed : six children in reception classes , where pupils are just four or five , were involved in a sexual act in a school ( file photo ) there were a further 15 incidents involving six and seven - year - olds , rising to 69 incidents for children in year 6 , when pupils turn 11 , at the time of the sexual misconduct			1
there was a surge in incidents as children reached secondary school - with 175 incidents in year 7			1
the figures show further increases in the next three year groups - with 248 incidents for 13 - year - olds , 256 for those a year older , and 240 for those in year 10 , when most pupils turn 15			2
former children ’s television presenter and @entity113 peer , @entity114 , said she was not surprised by the data , having heard anecdotal evidence and received reports from charities of incidents involving very young children			1
respect : former @entity122 presenter and @entity113 peer @entity114 said too many children are being exposed to pornographic material , and should learn to that sex is about ' mutual respect ' she said : ' i believe one of the main contributory factors is children being exposed to pornographic online material which is easily available on the internet , and they are emulating what they see			1
they want to discover what it feels like to experience the sexual act they have seen and if they do n’t achieve the level of satisfaction they expect they move on to the next girl			0
' we need to have a robust sex and relationship education programme rolled out across all schools in the country for children and young people , which is age appropriate , to help them understand the true meaning of love , respect and unconditional sexual relationships			1
' the former @entity158 presenter said young boys are ' becoming addicted to pornography ' and that teachers needed training to detect changes in children ’s behaviour patterns which might hint at their involvement in abuse			2
she added : ' we have to teach them that sex is about mutual respect			1
' the large majority of incidents concerned boys , with only nine per cent involving girls			0
however , there were some gender spikes in the data			0
a spokesman for the @entity179 of @entity180 said : ' the most concerning issues involve so - called " sexting " with children communicating inappropriately with each other through mobile technology			0
' there are also occasional reports of under age sexual intercourse , which do not reach the threshold for a criminal investigation , though the police are informed about such incidents			0
also sexualised behaviour , such as masturbation is a common theme			0
' in terms of the overall picture including informal consultations as well as formal referrals , the majority are females ( 55per cent )			0
' revealing : data shows the number of children excluded from schools for sexual misconduct many authorities said incidents of sexual misconduct appeared to be decreasing			1
a spokesman for @entity211 , which was among those to see a year - on - year decrease in reported incidents , said : ' we support schools with their work to prevent incidents , and to learn from any that happen so they can safeguard against them			1
' our on - going work to reduce the number of fixed - term exclusions includes measures to prevent and deal effectively with any problems of this nature			0
' we also run our anti-bullying ‘ stop ! ’ campaign with schools , and restorative justice programmes so students understand the consequences of their actions			0
' worry : one education authority said the most concerning issue was ' sexting ' with children communicating inappropriately with each other a @entity239 spokesman said : ' we share headteachers ’ serious concerns over sexual misconduct by pupils			1
that is why we have given teachers the power to search for and delete inappropriate images from phones , while the @entity249 and @entity250 and the @entity251 have produced useful material to help schools deal with ‘ sexting ’			0
' schools should teach pupils about respect for others and how the law applies to sexual relationships			1
and our statutory guidance is crystal clear - if a professional thinks a child is at risk of harm they should report it immediately to social care			0
' it is encouraging that official statistics show exclusions for sexual misconduct are decreasing year on year and represent less than 0.05 per cent of exclusions across the country			1
' the figures come after a damning report last month by the @entity278 , which warned that youngsters across the country are being exploited and that the authorities responsible for their safety are failing to protect them			0
the two - year inquiry found that 2,409 youngsters were known to be victims of child sexual exploitation by gangs and groups , while a further 16,500 were at risk			0
children aged between five and 16 were referred to @entity291 for a range of incidents , including sending indecent images of themselves ( file photo ) although education authorities were careful not to disclose any details of sexual misconduct due to the risk of identifying potential victims , some examples of the nature of some behaviour within @entity82 ’s classrooms has emerged			1
the vague term ' sexual misconduct ' is used to describe incidents from graffiti in the school toilets to serious offending , such as sexual abuse and using pornography in school			1
the figures show children as young as reception class - typically aged four and five - have been reprimanded between january 2010 and september 2013 , while the number of boys involved in sexual misconduct outnumbers girls by a rate of around 10 - 1			1
in the @entity323 borough of @entity324 , a five - year - old boy was excluded for using sexually explicit language , while another five - year - old was given a similar punishment for ' inappropriate touching '			0
children aged between five and 16 were referred to @entity329 ’s @entity291 for a range of incidents , including sending indecent images of themselves , watching pornography and for ' inappropriate sexual thoughts '			2
there were 61 incidents , with parents of children involved being invited to meetings and advice sessions			0
@entity340 reported 159 incidents , including three boys , aged between eight and nine , permanently excluded in 2011 for sexual misconduct			1
the same authority also disclosed one 12 - year - old boy was excluded for 30 days for his sexual offending			0
the @entity347 reported four permanent exclusions in 2010 - three of which were for 14 - year - old girls			2
@entity351 disclosed that an eight - year - old boy was permanently excluded in 2011 for ' behaving in a threatening and intimidating manner towards other students , including offensive sexual comments and requests of girls and the inappropriate touching of one of a group of girls '			0
the @entity360 , which has around 16,035 pupils on school rolls , recorded 15 incidents of pupils being excluded for sexual misconduct during the time frame , including three for offending against staff			1
staff were also at the receiving end of sexual comments from a year 7 pupil in @entity372 , who was suspended for one day			0
a school in @entity376 permanently excluded a 15 - year - old boy for indecent exposure , while a 13 - year - old boy was given the same punishment for “ inappropriate sexual gestures ” , the local authority said			2
while some of the larger councils reported incidents exceeding three figures during the time frame , many stated these numbers were decreasing year on year			2
others also disclosed a handful of incidents where staff were investigated - and in some cases sacked or prosecuted - for ' sexual misconduct ' involving pupils			1
in @entity397 , this included a substantiated allegation that an inappropriate image of a three - year - old girl was taken by a member of staff .			0
