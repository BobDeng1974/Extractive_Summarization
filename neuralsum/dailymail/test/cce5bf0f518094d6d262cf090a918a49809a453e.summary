there is not a @entity2 manager working in the @entity3 who is capable of guiding a team into the latter stages of the @entity7 , according to @entity8			1
there are no @entity2 teams in the quarter finals of the @entity7 and @entity8 does not believe there is a @entity2 manager who can turn those fortunes around			0
@entity8 does however believe that his friend and former team - mate @entity16 could lead @entity17 into the latter stages of @entity20 ’s premier club competition if he is given the chance to succeed @entity22 at @entity23 further down the line			2
@entity8 hopes @entity16 will go on and be one of the best manager 's in the world once he has done his apprenticeship under @entity22 writing in his @entity29 column , @entity8 said : ‘ i do n’t think there is a @entity2 manager who is currently capable of restoring @entity33 clubs to the final stages of the @entity7 , and winning the competition again			1
i hope that it will change in the future and i have high hopes that my friend @entity16 will be handed the reins at @entity17 at some point having served an apprenticeship under @entity22			0
’ @entity8 believes outgoing @entity44 manager @entity43 would be a welcome addition to the @entity3 – but does not believe he will replace @entity46 at @entity47			1
@entity8 believes outgoing @entity44 manager @entity43 could end up in the @entity3 @entity49 's head coach @entity48 could be heading @entity47 when his contract expires the former @entity17 midfielder believes that @entity48 will head to @entity52 once his contract at @entity49 expires at the end of next season			1
he added : ‘ there is no doubt in my mind that he [ @entity43 ] would be a success in @entity33 football , the only question is at which club			0
@entity47 is the destination that has been mentioned more than once but all the information that comes back to me in @entity61 is that @entity48 will take that job when his contract at @entity49 expires in one year ’s time			2
‘ while @entity47 have many good players , they have never gone beyond the second round of the @entity7 , much less won it			0
making them the best side in @entity20 would be a far more difficult task than doing the same at @entity74 or @entity49 , the latter of whom @entity48 took over after they won the @entity77			0

@entity8 hopes @entity16 will become the next top @entity2 manager after working with @entity22
@entity81 would like to see @entity43 manage in the @entity3
former @entity17 man believes @entity48 will manage @entity47 once his contract expires at @entity49
