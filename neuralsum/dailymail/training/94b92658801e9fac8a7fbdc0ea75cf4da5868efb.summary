by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 05:30 est , 5 october 2012 @entity1 has accused her father @entity1 of taking her trust money to fund his lavish lifestyle she grew up in the shadow of greatness			1
but for the daughter of legendary speed icon @entity1 her upbringing was anything but great			1
in an autobiography due to be published next week 63 - year - old @entity1 lays bare a tormented childhood and chronicles three failed marriages and a suicide attempt			1
she reveals how her father mysteriously emptied her trust fund before he tragically died in january 1967 on @entity16 and how the debonair dare - devil sacrificed her and his family in the pursuit of glory			1
yet , she does not blame him			2
nor does she resent @entity21 , the speedboat that cart - wheeled so spectacularly across the water during that ill - fated world speed record attempt 45 years ago			1
‘ to a large degree it was a very hard childhood , ’ she told the @entity25 yesterday			2
‘ i did n’t see it back then			2
i had nothing to compare it to			2
‘ the family life , the love and care of a mother and father just was n’t there			1
‘ my mother did n’t even like me most of the time , let alone love me			2
‘ and my father never displayed any affection towards me , never put his arm around me , never sat me on his knee , never praised me			1
‘ @entity21 was always paramount in his thoughts , feelings and actions			1
it was his tour de force , his raison d’etre			2
i was there and @entity21 was there and he chose @entity21			1
‘ that ’s not to say my father was a bad father			1
‘ i thought he was the best thing since sliced bread and amongst the low lows there were massive highs			2
but yes , some things were strange , different , unorthodox			2
’ her autobiography , @entity56 , documents her struggles growing up and how the lack of affection as an ‘ unwanted child ’ left her craving for love in later life			2
it also details the moment she learnt of her father ’s death at the age of 45 in a phone call with her mother who could only utter the words : ‘ there ’s been a terrible accident ’			2
born in 1949 @entity75 was packed away to boarding school at the age of two			0
@entity1 picturerd with her father 's mascot bear at a race in @entity81 in 1984 her father was already well - known and was travelling all over the world breaking records whilst her mother was far from maternal			1
‘ it must be the most difficult thing for any child to say : that she has no love , respect or true caring for her own mother , ’ she writes			0
‘ but , even worse , that a mother holds no emotion for her own child			0
but sadly , in my case , this was the plain and simple truth			0
‘ when my parents divorced , i think when i was nearly two years old , my mother found a place for me at a boarding school - cum - residential home , where i lived for two to three years , 365 days of the year			0
‘ she could find no place in her life for her only child and this was the convenient alternative			0
‘ apparently she was totally disappointed when her baby was a girl and i ’m sure my father would have preferred a boy , too			2
’ @entity1 's @entity21 hydroplane at speed on @entity16 in 1967 her parents divorced and in 1952 her father married again after a whirlwind romance			1
yet he remained detached from his daughter and very rarely showed any signs of affection towards her – often criticising and belittling her			2
she recalls watching him on this is your life in 1956 and adds : ‘ i was almost detached watching him on television			0
did i look at the programme and think : ‘ that ’s my daddy ? ’ i did n’t really know him			0
‘ in fact i do n’t have a poignant memory of first meeting my father			2
‘ in fact , it seemed all he did was criticise , belittle me			0
‘ he criticised my laugh in particular , said i sounded like a bloody donkey and then he would mimic the ‘ ee - ore , ee - ore ’ sound			0
maybe that ’s why i do n’t laugh out loud a lot now ...			0
’ she continues : ‘ he was very strict about behaviour and manners too and a great believer in spanking			0
he used to exact that punishment quite regularly if i was naughty			0
‘ i was so scared if i knew it was that time again that i used to wee myself and he would tell me to go to the toilet and then to my room to wait for him			0
‘ then he would come and administer the punishment			0
he used to put me across his knee and spank me with his hand on my bottom			0
’ ' my father used my trust money in the early days but what he used it for i do not know - only he knows , ' said @entity1 ( above , seeing her father off to @entity154 and , right , as she is today ) in her teenage years she went to a succession of boarding schools and in the holidays would travel to @entity154 and @entity158 to watch her father ’s speed record attempts			1
she was also packed off to @entity161 to stay with family friends			0
by january 1967 her father , onto his third marriage to a cabaret singer , was at @entity166 attempting to break his own world speed record in @entity21 whilst she was working in @entity168 at a ski resort			1
she was 17 at the time and can remember the telephone call telling her that her father had been killed during the second leg of his latest world record attempt , at more than 300 mph			1
‘ my mother arranged my flight home and the next day the housekeeper took me to @entity179 airport which was about 200 miles away - it ’s still all a bit of a haze , ’ she writes			0
‘ it was strange , surreal			0
i have vivid memories of sitting in the departure hall opposite a news stand where every single @entity188 paper and even the @entity161 ones had the picture of @entity21 going up in to the air			1
‘ i looked at them with a total sense of disbelief			0
’ @entity1 ( above ) describes mr @entity1 , who remains the only person to set both world land and water speed records in the same year , as a strict and ' very distant ' father within a year miss @entity1 was engaged to the first of her three husbands and had already had an abortion			1
then , in 1984 , in an attempt to emulate her father ’s success on water , she too attempted a world speedboat record – and miraculously walked away from a crash that was almost identical to his			2
there was further heartbreak to come			0
with her third marriage crumbling she took an overdose of painkillers in a bid to end her life			0
then , in december 2000 , she received the news she never thought would come			0
almost 34 years after the tragic crash a diver had found @entity21 – and her father – at the bottom of @entity16			1
‘ when my father ’s body was finally recovered , still inside his suit , there had to be dna testing , even though we had established it was his @entity228 and lighter , ’ writes miss @entity1 , who now lives in @entity220			1
‘ a policeman came to my house and took a mouth swab and the result came back that the chances of our not being related were at least two million to one			0
’ @entity1 was eventually laid to rest whilst his daughter and a team of experts set about restoring @entity21 to her former glory			1
they now intend to launch her one more time onto @entity16			0
world speed record breaker @entity1 pictured in 1966 @entity1 strove to set speed records on land and water following the death of his father , sir @entity245 , at the age of 63 from a stroke in 1948			1
he was aided by @entity248 , chief engineer for sir @entity245 - the latter holding 13 world speed records in the 1920s and 30s			0
@entity1 remains the only person to set both world land and water speed records in the same year in 1964			1
he began using his father 's old boat @entity257 , but after a structural failure at 170 mph in 1951 , he developed the @entity21			1
@entity1 set seven world water speed records in @entity21 between 1955 and 1964 but was killed instantly when the craft lifted from the surface in rough water and somersaulted back down into @entity166 in 1967			1
the wreckage was recovered in 2000 and his body found the following year			0
between them , @entity1 and his father set 11 speed records on water and 10 on land			1
