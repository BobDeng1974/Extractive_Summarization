she explained to this year 's @entity9 class that although she had been offered jobs elsewhere , she went to work at @entity4 because ' if you ’re offered a seat on a rocket ship , you do n’t ask what seat			1
' the former head of the @entity39 graduated from @entity9 17 years ago and advised students not to climb the corporate ladder but to ' build their skills '			1
@entity4 's top underwriter said yesterday that it was prepared to pay back investors who were burned when they bought shares			1
the share price sat at $ 32.30 today down around 15 per cent from its initial public offering			1
amid a flurry of lawsuits over @entity4 's ipo , @entity58 announced in a memo on wednesday that it is reviewing @entity4 trades and would adjust prices for some retail customers who overpaid			1
trouble ahead : ms @entity10 and @entity4 founder @entity66 rings the @entity68 's opening bell for the company 's initial public offering the ipo mishaps have sparked numerous lawsuits against @entity58 , the @entity68 stock exchange and @entity4 itself by shareholders who claimed they hid the social networking company 's weakened growth forecasts just before it went public			1
the allegations raised questions about whether top investors profited at the expense of smaller buyers			0
meanwhile , @entity4 is in talks with the @entity84 to move its stock from the @entity68 after the botched ipo on friday , according to a person familiar with the matter			2
the insider spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly			0
@entity4 's much - anticipated ipo was delayed by a half - hour on friday because of technical glitches on the @entity68			2

that 's a far cry from the $ 37.58 that @entity66 fetched for 30.2 million shares he unloaded on friday			1
by the end of trading on tuesday however the price had dropped to $ 31 meaning @entity66 saved himself a cool $ 174 million by getting out early			1
the 28 - year - old still holds a vast amount of @entity4 stock but his decision to sell off so much will leave investors wondering about his confidence in the company			1
the drop is based around the realization that @entity4 might not be growing as quickly as initially thought			2
and the company 's second - quarter growth will likely fall short of expectations as fewer new users join the social networking giant			1

@entity66 ’s plans to sell were revealed in documents filed in advance of the ipo on friday , but the problems that have happened since cast them in a new light			2
venture capitalist @entity177 also announced his plans early too but his return was beyond anything he could have hoped for			0
he wrote @entity66 a cheque for $ 500,000 in 2004 but has offloaded 16.8 million shares for the tidy profit of $ 633 million			1
among the others to cash out was @entity185 , the chief executive of online gaming company @entity186			0
@entity187 returns : @entity177 ( left ) , the co-founder of @entity188 , earned $ 633 million for an initial investment of $ 500,000			0

venture capitalists @entity194 , which handed over $ 12.7million back in 2005 , sold $ 1.9billion of stock but retained $ 5.8billion			0
whilst the big players were making a fortune however , small investors have seen their attempts to get in on the @entity4 bubble fall flat			2
as of close of trading on tuesday shares were a staggering 18 per cent below what they had been at the opening on friday			0
at one point they had slumped 31 per cent from the $ 45 peak hit shortly after they started trading			0
but according to analysts @entity212 this could not be the end of it and the slide could carry on until stocks are just $ 9.59 each			0
it has examined estimates from @entity221 experts and concluded that @entity4 is currently vastly overpriced , though its forecasts do tend to be gloomier than others			0
@entity227 , editor at finance website crossing @entity221 , said : ‘ @entity4 right now is going for far more than what it 's worth , it 's like buying $ 1 for $ 1.98 , it just does n't make sense at this price			2
‘ just from basic modelling the stock should be around $ 17 to $ 20 , and that is with a lot of variables			0
cleaning up : @entity4 's ipo has caused a mess that is currently being investigated by the @entity117 , two regulatory agencies and the state of @entity32 ‘ i would call that an ideal price			2
i would be interested in buying and i think that is a good deal for investors			0
’ among those who did not cash out on friday when @entity4 shares were trading at $ 38 each was the company ’s former president @entity248			1
his stock is still worth over $ 2billion but the price slump meant his fortune decreased by a staggering $ 300million			0
in a sign of how feeling is changing against @entity4 , some commentators have begun comparing its activities to the most reckless behaviour of @entity221 banks			2
they have also coined the word ‘ zucked ’ , which means to get shafted on the sale of @entity4 shares			2
these major sell - offs comes as new allegations are emerging the the over-hyped @entity4 stock sale may have been rigged against small , every - day buyers			2
two separates lawsuits have been filed against the company and the banks that organized the ipo , @entity58 and @entity113 , alleging the executives knew second - quarter revenue would not meet expectations as @entity4 's growth slows			1
@entity159 says this information was shared with the banks by a @entity4 insider			1
as @entity66 went on his pre-ipo roadshow , touting his company , the banks downgraded their revenue projections for @entity4			1
this information could have reduced the value of @entity4 's initial stock offering			0
in turn , this could have decreased the amount of money @entity66 and his early investors made when they dumped tens of millions of @entity4 shares on friday as trading opened			1
however , the banks failed to widely disclose the downgrade , the lawsuits say			0
@entity159 says they told only large , institutional investors so they would know to stay away from @entity4 stock on the first day of trading			0
