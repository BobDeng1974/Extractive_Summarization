@entity2 v @entity0 will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century			1
evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political , social and cultural undertones , the scale of expectation and outside influences			2
where @entity14 v @entity0 comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the @entity19			1
in this , the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , i recall when a hard man could take no more ... the no @entity27 @entity28 , @entity29 november 25 , 1980 @entity32 v @entity30 the first two of the three fights between the @entity35 and @entity36 raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with @entity32 , @entity30 , @entity43 and @entity44 engaging each other in some of the ring ’s epic battles			1
by way of a preview , @entity32 had defeated the previous — and equally great — @entity50 to win the world welterweight title			2
@entity32 celebrates after @entity30 quit in their fight in @entity29 in november 1980 @entity32 decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the @entity56 in the second fight @entity59 @entity58 october 30 , 1974 , @entity60 , @entity61 @entity62 v @entity58 march 8 , 1971 , @entity63 , @entity64 @entity67 v @entity65 july 4 , 1910 , @entity68 , @entity69 @entity71 v @entity70 june 22 , 1938 , @entity72 , @entity64 @entity58 v @entity73 october 1 , 1975 , @entity74 , @entity75 in his first defence , @entity32 had been contentiously outpointed by @entity30 in @entity78 ’s @entity77			1
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision			0
that was changed to unanimous in @entity30 ’s favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148 - 147			1
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of @entity30 and only two for @entity32 — with 10 even			1
that was described as ‘ a monument to indecision ’			0
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the @entity98 in @entity28 on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief			0
@entity32 had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the @entity56 hard man in a mano - a - mano slug - out			1
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement			0
@entity30 became frustrated as @entity32 danced around him before unleashing his punches after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , @entity30 turned his back and said ' no mas ' ‘ the whole fight i was moving			1
then voom , i ’d snap his head back with a jab			0
@entity115 , i ’d snap it back again			0
he ’d try to get me on the ropes			0
i ’d pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch			0
’ so it went for more than seven rounds , with @entity30 becoming increasingly frustrated			2
in the eighth @entity32 cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in @entity30 ’s face			1
there had been a moment earlier when @entity32 appeared to pat him playfully on the backside			2
just before the bell @entity30 turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ‘ no mas			2
’ @entity133 for no more			0
@entity32 celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking @entity30 out the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for @entity30 to rebuild his reputation the watching world was stunned			1
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible			1
sensing the reaction @entity30 claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh - in			1
but his manager @entity148 said : ‘ he always eats like that before a fight			0
he quit because he was embarrassed			0
’ @entity30 had been a national icon in @entity56 and there was anger on the streets at his action			1
television commercials featuring him were taken off			0
it took three years for @entity30 to restore his high place in his country ’s esteem			2
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out @entity163 in @entity164 to win the world light - middleweight title			0
@entity167 returned to the streets			0
@entity32 would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title			2
but @entity32 took most pride from the trilogy from forcing @entity30 to say @entity175			1
he said : ‘ to me , making @entity30 to quit was better than knocking him out			0

@entity2 v @entity0 is now just nine days away
@entity181 *'s* @entity180 has been counting down the greatest fights
in the sixth of a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , we have @entity32 v @entity30
@entity32 humiliated his opponent until he said ' @entity175 ' - no more
it took @entity30 three years to *reclaim* his mantle as a hero in @entity56
