@entity1 did cheat its way to victory at the 1978 @entity4 after its government arranged with @entity6 to rig a key match , it was claimed today			2
host nation @entity1 needed to win its second round game by four clear goals to reach the final at the expense of arch rivals @entity14			2
there have always been suspicions about the game after @entity1 secured a comfortable 6 - 0 win , before going on to beat the @entity19 3 - 1 in the final to win their first @entity4			1
champions : @entity1 captain @entity21 holds the @entity23 trophy after his team won the 1978 @entity4 final 3 - 1 against the @entity19 match winner : striker @entity26 scored twice in the final against the @entity19 , but should @entity1 have even got through ? group b with one game to play @entity32 w d l gf ga @entity30 @entity14 2 1 1 0 3 0 +3 3 @entity1 2 1 1 0 2 0 +2 3 @entity33 2 1 0 1 1 2 − 1 2 @entity6 2 0 0 2 0 4 − 4 0 group b in the second round was a shoot - out between @entity1 and great rivals @entity37			1
after the first round of games , @entity14 beat @entity6 3 - 0 while @entity1 saw off @entity33 2 - 0			1
the two @entity41 giants then played out a tense 0 - 0 draw , leaving them both level going into the final game			1
@entity14 then beat @entity33 3 - 1 , but because @entity1 were not playing until later that day they knew they had to beat @entity6 by four clear goals to qualify for the final			1
trailing 2 - 0 at half time , @entity6 collapsed in the second half and @entity1 went on to win 6 - 0 and made it to the final in the @entity52 , @entity53			1
during the final , star striker @entity26 gave @entity1 the lead , only for @entity55 to equalise for the @entity19			2
with seconds left , @entity56 hit the post and the game went into extra-time , before @entity26 hit his sixth of the competition to win the @entity4 for @entity1 for the first time			0
but now former @entity65 senator @entity64 has confirmed that the shock result was agreed before the match by the dictatorships of the two countries			0
mr @entity64 , 80 , made the accusations to @entity53 judge @entity71 , who last week issued an order of arrest against former @entity65 military president @entity74			1
he is accused of illegally sending 13 @entity65 citizens to @entity1 as part of the so - called @entity79 , through which @entity76 dictatorships in the 1970s cooperated in the repression of political dissidents			2
once inside @entity1 , the prisoners were tortured by the brutal military regime and forced to sign false confessions			0
mr @entity64 , an opposition leader at the time , claims @entity87 dictator @entity86 only accepted the political prisoners on condition that @entity6 deliberately lost the @entity4 match - and by enough goals to ensure @entity1 progressed to the final			1
he said in court : ' @entity86 needed to win the @entity4 to cleanse @entity1 's bad image around the world			0
' so he only accepted the group if @entity6 allowed the @entity98 national team to triumph			2
' group b in the second round of the tournament was made up of @entity1 , @entity14 , @entity33 and @entity6			0
after @entity14 beat @entity6 3 - 0 , then saw off @entity33 3 - 1 , @entity1 knew it had to win its game against @entity6 by at least four goals			1
they did so with a suspicious degree of ease , leading to rumours that @entity6 might have been bribed			0
other rumours claimed @entity6 had been offered a large shipment of grain to throw the match			0
@entity1 caused controversy by delaying their games until the outcome of the other result in @entity99 , so they knew exactly what they needed to do before every match			0
rapturous welcome : @entity1 fans give their team a ticker - tape reception as they run out in the @entity4 final in the @entity52 , @entity53 without their 1978 @entity4 victory , @entity1 would have won the tournament just once - the same as @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
years after the game , @entity98 striker @entity131 said : ' with what i know now , i ca n't say i 'm proud of my victory			0
' but i did n't realise ; most of us did n't			0

@entity139 won 6 - 0 to make it through to final
team went on to lift trophy in @entity53
