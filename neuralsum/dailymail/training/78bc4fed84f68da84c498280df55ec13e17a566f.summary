@entity1 and the @entity2 will soon resume limited inter-country adoptions , both nations said today			1
the announcement comes six years after a ban was imposed because of allegations of widespread baby - selling and children offered without the consent of their birth parents			1
under the new agreement , @entity2 will be able to adopt children with special needs and those over five years of age			1
five - month - old baby girls are cradled by workers at an orphanage in @entity20 province , near @entity21 , @entity1 adoptions will resume ' soon ' once the @entity1 government announces which @entity2 - based adoption service providers are authorized to represent @entity2 parents , the @entity2 @entity22 said in an advisory to journalists announcing a media event to discuss inter-country adoptions			1
@entity31 , director of the adoption agency at the @entity33 , said two @entity2 agencies would be given licenses next week to operate in @entity1			0
prior to the ban in 2008 , @entity1 was a popular destination for @entity2 wanting to adopt children			1
but the popularity led to concerns within the @entity2 embassy that the demand had led to a poorly regulated industry supplying young , healthy babies to prospective parents prepared to pay significant sums of money , raising ethical questions			2
in 2009 , a @entity50 - commissioned report on adoptions in @entity1 confirmed those allegations			0
it said cash payments by adoption agencies to orphanages led them to seek out children for adoption , often without proper checks into their background or their family circumstances			0
some @entity2 senators and international adoption lobby groups have been urging @entity1 to pass stronger laws and better monitor the process so that adoptions could resume			2
the @entity2 @entity22 said the agreement was a ' success in the bilateral relationship between the @entity2 and @entity1			0
' there is limited demand among prospective adoptive parents for older children and those with special needs , meaning monitoring for any violations should be easier			0
a delegation of @entity2 senators which visited @entity1 last year said allowing for special needs adoptions would be seen as a first step to resuming all adoptions			2
demand for inter-country adoptions has risen in recent years			0
for singles wanting a child , or couples unable or unwilling to conceive , the idea of adopting a foreign baby from an orphanage in a poor country is attractive			0
but programs in several developing countries , such as @entity96 and @entity97 , have been beset by scandals and allegations of baby - selling			1
in september 2012 , officials from @entity102 and @entity1 signed an agreement to restart adoptions which were halted in 2009			0
partly as a result of fears over baby - selling scandals , the number of international adoptions has fallen to its lowest point in 15 years , according to annual statistics compiled by @entity112 , an expert on international adoptions at @entity115 's @entity114 .			1
