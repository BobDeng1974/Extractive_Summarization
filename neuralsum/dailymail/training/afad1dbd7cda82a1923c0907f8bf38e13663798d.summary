by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 12:18 est , 25 september 2013 planning : @entity1 and his wife , @entity2 , will update their historic property making it into six storeys with five bedrooms former @entity7 presenter @entity1 has won planning permission to ' substantially demolish ' his £ 17m @entity9 listed home and replace it with a new six - storey , five - bedroom home			1
the 66 - year - old television presenter was at the @entity15 planning meeting himself last night to hear his extensive and controversial plans for the historic building described as being like @entity18 - with people either loving it or hating it			1
but he was given permission to go ahead with his £ 10m building project on the elegant house between @entity24 and @entity25 in west @entity26			1
apart from a few tweaks in the exterior design , the plans were agreed by @entity15 ’s @entity30 last night , with chairman @entity31 praising the design			2
he said the design of the house was ' one of those things , you either like it or you do n't like it , a bit like @entity18			0
' i am afraid that i really like it			0
' the new property , which will keep its @entity44 facade , will boast a garage , a two - storey basement , swimming pool , gym , projection room , staff quarters and a wine cellar , and could be worth up to £ 40m once it is finished			1
proposals also include transforming the exterior by adding a series of pergolas to the garden and a set of balconies to the house itself , giving views over @entity62 in leafy @entity63			1
as it stands : this is what the @entity9 listed @entity67 looks like at the moment planning officers had received 19 objections from local residents , and just four letters of support for the transformation of the property which mr @entity1 and his wife @entity2 paid £ 17m for last november			2
last year it emerged that @entity1 and his wife @entity2 had sold another luxury property for £ 35m - more than 40 times what they paid for it 20 years ago			2
the value of that house , which was bought by @entity86 businessman @entity85 , had been significantly raised by extensive renovations			0
they bought the 1908 town house in @entity24 , west @entity26 in 1993 for £ 950,000			1
they stold it to the financier @entity92 and his wife @entity93 for about £ 35million			0
the tv presenter , who co-founded @entity95 , split the proceeds among his three grown - up sons and a charity			1
@entity99 , secretary of @entity100 , had told planners : ' we do not consider that introducing a modern style of design needs to be out of keeping with the architectural style of the houses in the square , but the scale of the extension is very large and we feel will be obtrusive			0
' mr @entity31 granted approval on the conditions that one of the proposed pergolas be removed , the roof be pulled back slightly to prevent overlooking into neighbours ’ homes , and that the gates be made of railings			0
he said : ' it is also very important to bring this building back into use			0
' the proposal had been opposed by angry local residents who claimed @entity1 and his wife ’s plans for the @entity44 villa , which dates back to 1826 , were ' out of character ' with the area			1
@entity1 , who stepped down from presenting @entity7 five years ago , was co-host for many years to @entity129 , who was shot dead in 1999 speaking after the meeting he said : ' i am sorry we have lost the pergola , it does n’t cause any problems with the adjoining premises			2
' but yes , overall i am glad that we got it			0

tv presenter *'s* controversial £ 10m plans for elegant @entity26 house agreed
he can rip out much behind the @entity44 facade and add pool and cellar
@entity148 had opposed @entity1 ' plans for @entity63 house as ' obtrusive '
