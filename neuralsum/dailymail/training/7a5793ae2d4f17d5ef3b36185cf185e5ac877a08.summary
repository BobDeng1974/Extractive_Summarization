by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:30 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:57 est , 31 december 2013 on an average day , street performers count themselves lucky to wrangle a wry smile out of passers - by - let alone a coin			0
to merit a dancing partner ? simply unfathomable			0
but eccentric entertainer @entity8 was treated to just that when a little toddler leaped out from the crowds in a heart - warming moment of spontaneity			2
but then a shy boy jumping in the corner gets lost in the music , and a spontaneous duet ensues the performance , which has now gone viral , left crowds milling through @entity27 's streets stunned as the pair darted around each other for almost five minutes			1
while @entity17 - born @entity8 beamed at the audience , the unnamed stage crasher could have been in his own living room			1
at first he was hesitant , standing with his family against @entity34 in the city centre during the @entity36 last august			2
but as the spandex - clad dancer scaled round the audience , he turned saw the little boy jumping up and down to the music - we speak no @entity43 by @entity44 - in a corner			1
@entity8 spots the little boy jumping in a corner by @entity34 in the rainy @entity49 capital encouragement : @entity8 bounded over to teach the boy some moves and tried to get him to join in with a high - five it looks like that was the end of it			1
but suddenly , the boy loses his inhibitions @entity8 , who travels the world with his colourful boombox , was elated and bounded over to teach him some moves			1
the boy seems happy but hesitant - he copies , but keeps looking down			0
finally , @entity8 gives him a high - five and gestures him into the square			2
and after feigning reluctance for just a second , the boy drops the act and marches in			0
a couple of ecstatic jumps are all it takes to get him warmed up			0
completely fearless , both bound around as if no one is watching in @entity75 in @entity27 this august @entity8 plays to the audience and looks over at the boy , but his dance partner is consumed by concentration in something of a ' superman ' move , the boy runs forwards , head down and arms ahead @entity8 , who has performed on @entity87 , was in awe of the little boy from that moment on , he is consumed by concentration - eyes on the ground , feet everywhere , arms flailing			1
the crowds - and @entity8 - scream and applaud			2
and it just keeps coming			0
@entity8 was named @entity17 's @entity95 at the @entity96 in @entity97 , where he was awarded $ 10,000			1
he also performed on @entity87 in 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 , and appeared on @entity98 2011			0
but the boy seems unphased as he jumps and twists , flipping his hands upwards and downwards			0
@entity8 stood back as the boy pulled out moves normally often on shows like @entity106 's @entity105 @entity8 applauded the little dancer on @entity108 saying , ' this kid rocks ! ' after more than three minutes , the music slows and @entity8 bows			1
but the boy ploughs on			0
commenting on the @entity108 video , filmed on august 26 , @entity8 wrote : ' let loose			1
this kid rocks ! it 's always a good time for a dance party ! ' somebody else wrote : ' this kid its my hero ! just live the life ! and enjoy the moment ! ï » ¿ and another said : ' this guy is an awesome dancer ! '			0
