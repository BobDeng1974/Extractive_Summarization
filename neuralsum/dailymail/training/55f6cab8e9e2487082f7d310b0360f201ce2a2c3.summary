@entity0 could see the question coming just as clearly as @entity2 was able to watch @entity4 ’s cross onto his boot for his first goal in an @entity8 shirt			1
can similarities be drawn from the way @entity0 re-invigorated the career of @entity12 and that of the player bought from @entity14 for £ 16million on transfer deadline day ? ‘ give me some time , ’ @entity0 smiled as he enjoyed his team ’s 3 - 0 victory at @entity18			1
‘ it is a bit early to say that when you look at the number of goals @entity12 scored			1
@entity2 opens his account for @entity8 in their 3 - 0 victory over @entity27 @entity8 fans will be hoping that @entity2 follows in the footsteps of @entity30 legend @entity12 ‘ i think he has an interesting potential and let ’s see how he develops			1
he has a good mentality , good physical potential , good technical potential			0
‘ he contributes to our team play because he does n’t lose the ball up front and those are important qualities			0
’ @entity12 was a striker , about to turn 22 , struggling on the wing at @entity42 before arriving in north @entity43 and getting the centre forward role he desired			1
@entity2 is 23 and left @entity46 because opportunities up front were so limited			1
‘ yes , he is a good act to follow , you know			0
i have nothing against it , ’ @entity0 agreed			2
@entity2 celebrates with @entity4 after setting the @entity54 up for @entity8 's first goal clearly one sound finish does not an @entity12 make			1
the @entity57 scored 226 goals , won two @entity60 titles and earned numerous individual accolades as the talisman of @entity8 ’s team in the early 2000s			1
but the signs were encouraging as @entity2 started his third game in succession as the sole striker			1
never in his time at @entity14 was he entrusted in such manner			0
against @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity2 missed two excellent chances from similar positions – hitting the post and dragging a shot just wide – but @entity0 made the point that by being given a run his confidence and accuracy would improve			1
besides , he is happy his last - minute purchase is getting scoring opportunities at all			0
it took @entity12 eight games before he found his first @entity8 goal			1
@entity2 has the athleticism and pace that can stretch defences in the way @entity12 did and also possesses the touch you would expect from a player brought up through @entity14 ’s academy			1
his pass for @entity4 ’s opening goal was one the @entity54 would have been proud of himself , slicing the ball between @entity95 and @entity96 with perfect weight			0
( an @entity99 own goal was the third scored in three minutes and 15 seconds			2
) @entity0 converted @entity12 into @entity8 's greatest ever goal scorer the area @entity2 can improve comes with his decision - making when given time to think about a finish , as that chipped shot when through on @entity107 against @entity108 last season illustrated			1
it is why @entity111 said @entity2 ’s scoring statistics were not up to the standard expected at @entity14			2
@entity0 described how he must gain that instinctive knowledge for where to place a finish and challenged his striker to adopt an ‘ animalistic ’ temperament			1
‘ i think it is not a question of potential it is more a nervous problem because in training he scores goals like a real striker , ’ @entity0 explained			1
‘ he rushed a bit his finishing until now maybe because he did n't score			2
‘ he has played at @entity14 in the position wide for the last two or three years , never through the middle			0
you lose a little bit that instinct to score and as well that pressure which is a little animalistic to score			0
' you need to always be in the middle and wait for your chance to kill the opponent			0
on the flank you have less of that responsibility			0
‘ he was not soft			0
he did a different job , he worked up and down and provided for others			0
selfish is a word i do n’t like			0
i like a striker who gives the ball when he has to give the ball and scores when he can score			2
the fact he can provide and can score for me is very important			0
’ @entity0 gets a warm welcome from @entity27 's mascot ahead of their @entity60 clash that link - up play is what makes @entity2 ’s fee seem so reasonable and were he to get 20 goals this season his price would be regarded as a bargain			1
that remains to be seen , of course , and when @entity158 returns from injury @entity0 will have a decision to make			2
this is the time @entity2 needs to make his mark			2
he is predicting better things to come			0
‘ i ’ve not really had much time to get together with the boys and have many training sessions , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ once i carry on training much more and get into the matches i will develop a much better understanding with the players			0

@entity2 scored a goal and provided another in the 3 - 0 win at @entity27
@entity8 striker is 23 , while @entity12 joined aged 22
both struggled out wide before being given a chance by @entity0 in their preferred central role
@entity12 took eight games to score his first goal for the club , but finished with 226 , the club 's *record*
*wenger* believe 's @entity2 's finishing will improve by playing centrally
