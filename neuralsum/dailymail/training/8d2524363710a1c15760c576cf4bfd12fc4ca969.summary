president @entity1 's approval rating among the @entity3 public has reached an all - time low			1
just 41 percent of the country now approves of the job that @entity1 is doing , down five percent from a month ago , according to a new @entity7 poll			1
dissatisfaction with healthcare reform continues to play a large role in @entity3 ' disgruntlement with the president			1
while @entity14 are most unhappy with the president 's implementation of his signature law , they are not alone in their displeasure			1
president @entity1 , who is currently on a week - long trip to @entity20 , will face an all - time low approval rating upon return support for the healthcare law was upside down , with only 44 percent saying they supported the changes @entity26 made to the healthcare system , down from 49 percent a month ago			1
approval of @entity1 's handling of the healthcare law was predictably split down party lines , but among self - identified independents , more than two - thirds strongly disapprove of the way the president has handled the implementation of his signature law			1
among all respondents , only 37 percent approved of the way @entity1 is handling the healthcare law , and nearly twice as many respondents strongly disapproved of the president 's implementation of @entity26 as those who strongly approved - a mere 24 percent			1
worse , just 41 percent of respondents said implementation is going better than expected compared to when it began			2
particularly telling of the level of discontent @entity1 faces over healthcare implementation is the low number of @entity14 polled			0
republicans only made up only two of every 10 people interviewed			0
just 41 percent of the country now approves of the job that @entity1 is doing , down five percent from a month ago implementation of the healthcare law got off to a notoriously bad start last october			1
the @entity26 sign up website healthcare.gov repeatedly crashed during the open enrollment period for the federal health exchanges , making @entity1 and his administration , namely @entity62 secretary @entity61 , look foolish			2
the last day of @entity26 enrollment , march 31 , was plagued with more problems related to the website 's failure to function properly , forcing the @entity1 administration to extend sign - up time for @entity3 who tried to enroll in healthcare by the government mandated deadline but could n't			1
after first saying she would remain at the helm of @entity62 until next fall , @entity61 announced days later that she would soon leave the administration			0
@entity75 had hoped that @entity61 ' departure would decrease @entity3 ' annoyance with @entity26			0
@entity26 numbers have only gotten worse , not better , since @entity61 ' announcement , however , as vexation with the poorly implemented law lingers			0
this image of @entity26 sign up site @entity83 taken on march 31 is indicative of the problems many @entity3 trying to sign up for healthcare ran into throughout the winter at issue for many @entity3 polled was the perceived cost increases that @entity26 has wreaked on their personal finances			2
only eight percent told pollsters they thought their personal health care costs are going down as a result of @entity26			0
nearly six times as many said their health care costs were increasing as because of the president 's signature law			1
likewise , more than five times as many people said the country 's healthcare costs were going up as a result of @entity26 than those who said they thought national health spending was going down			0
it 's unclear how much of an impact @entity3 ' negative feelings about @entity26 will have on @entity75 candidates competing in the nation 's mid-term elections in november			2
respondents in the poll said they trusted @entity75 more to handle nearly every issue , including @entity26 , but pollsters interviewed a significantly higher number of @entity75 than @entity14			0
of note is that double the percentage of respondents in the poll thought @entity3 was on the wrong track			0
of those who felt @entity3 was on the wrong track , they were three times more likely to blame @entity75 in @entity123 than republicans			0
respondents were split on who they 'd personally vote for if the election were held today , the @entity127 or @entity14 , but they were likely to say @entity14 should be in charge in @entity123 to serve as a check president @entity1 than @entity75			2
' this poll shows people want @entity14 to fight back against the @entity1 agenda -- from foreign policy to @entity26 and the economy , @entity134 spokesman @entity133 told @entity140 in an email			2
' those 2014 @entity75 who have overwhelmingly supported the extreme @entity1 agenda are going to suffer at the election booths for putting donors interests above that of their constituents			0

president @entity1 's approval rating is now at 41 percent , according to a new poll
that 's five percent down from where it was just a month ago
dissatisfaction with the president 's signature healthcare law continues to play a large role in @entity3 ' disgruntlement with the president
support for @entity26 is also down five percent from last month
