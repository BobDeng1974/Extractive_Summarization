by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 19:01 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 2 january 2013 a minister yesterday outraged train passengers by insisting that despite overcrowding , disruption and inflationary fare rises they are getting a ‘ premium service ’			2
on the day rail travellers were hit with their tenth above - inflation annual fare price rise in as many years , transport minister @entity8 insisted : ‘ we ’re not doing too bad			1
’ rises have averaged nearly 4 per cent , but mr @entity8 said fares were not overly expensive when off - peak tickets – and not just the most costly rush - hour ones – were taken into account			1
a @entity37 spokesman later admitted the minister had no figures to substantiate his claim – which had come from ‘ an anecdote he heard at a conference last year ’			1
the controversy erupted as the @entity24 return to work got underway with commuters enduring ‘ cattle class ’ conditions and facing higher fares			1
regulated fares , which include season tickets , are increasing by up to 6.4 per cent for 2013 , with an average rise across all tickets of 3.9 per cent			1
on some routes , the price of a season ticket has now risen by more than 70 per cent in a decade			2
the price rises follow the misery experienced by millions of passengers over @entity61 and @entity24			1
the period was dominated by delays , disruption , over-running engineering works and pleas by rail bosses for passengers not to travel ‘ unless absolutely necessary ’			1
last night passengers and critics said mr @entity8 ’s comments were ‘ astonishing ’ and accused the @entity73 minister and the @entity74 of being ‘ out of touch ’			2
@entity76 , of the @entity77 , said : ‘ to suggest passengers are enjoying a premium service is astonishing			2
' many commuters are enduring cattle class conditions on some of these lines and that is anything but a premium product – even for cattle			0
’ @entity87 , of the campaign group @entity88 , said : ‘ enough is enough			0
they ’re out of touch			0
fares have risen with no perceptible improvement in service			1
' our fares are the highest in @entity96			1
but we do n’t have the best rail service in @entity96			0
most people do n’t choose to travel at peak times – they are forced to do so to get to work on time			0
’ mr @entity8 accepted the above - inflation rises were ‘ not ideal ’ and wanted to end them as soon as possible , but did not put a timescale on it			0
he added : ‘ you could argue people who are travelling in the rush hour are using the premium product and ought to pay something which reflects that			0
’ passenger protest : @entity113 transport secretary @entity112 joins @entity115 general secretary , @entity116 and other rail campaigners during a demonstration against fair rises outside @entity120 in @entity121 he also insisted that ‘ given the stresses and strains we ’re not doing too bad ’			0
his praise for the network is all the more extraordinary because his department has recently delivered damning statistics on lateness and overcrowding on trains			0
last month @entity132 ’s 7.44am @entity133 to @entity135 service was named as the most overcrowded in @entity136 and @entity137 , with 80 per cent more passengers than it was built to carry in comfort			0
other figures showed that the worst - performing train companies are running fewer than half their services on time			0
@entity34 passengers pay some of the most expensive fares in @entity96			1
based on rush - hour prices for those who do not pre-book , a @entity34 traveller can go an average of 133 miles for £ 100 , against 188 miles in @entity151 for the same money , 312 in @entity153 and @entity30 , 365 in @entity137 and @entity154 , 558 in @entity155 and 736 in @entity156			1
the policy of annual above - inflation fare rises is intended to switch more of the burden of paying for the railways away from the taxpayer and towards the fare - payer			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ we ’ve inherited a policy from the last government – the only difference between us and them is that we ’ve embarked on the biggest investment programme since the 19th century			0
’ he accepted that ‘ walk - on fares ’ – not booked in advance – can be among the most expensive in @entity96			2
but he argued : ‘ once you take the basket of fares , include early advance and off peaks , we are not nearly as expensive as is being presented			2
’ all rail fares go up by an average of 3.9 per cent today but some will increase by as much as 10 per cent @entity179 ticket fare @entity180 @entity183 - @entity182 off - peak return £ 25 to £ 27.50 up 10 % @entity121 - @entity184 return £ 98.60 to £ 107.70 up 9.2 % @entity121 - @entity186 off - peak return £ 103 to £ 111.50 up 8.3 % * @entity187 ( @entity187 ) says ‘ average ’ fare rise for all fares : up 3.9 %			1

average 3.9 % increase this year but some go up by as much as 10 %
new research reveals ten years of ' appalling and shocking ' hikes
millions have seen fares increase by 50 % or more since 2003
@entity24 commute *blighted* by delays and *cancellations*
