a beach in @entity1 contains five times the safe levels of radiation fueling concerns that @entity7 's @entity6 nuclear plant ’s crisis is impacting areas across the country			1
it comes just days after radiation readings were found to be double the normal amount in @entity14 's recent snowfall			1
according to @entity23 user , @entity16 , who posted a video of him taking the @entity20 readings in @entity21 , the findings mean that ‘ small particles of radioactive material are indeed coming down in the precipitation			0
past tests show around @entity28 in the same spot on a nice day with no precipitation ’			0
in this picture the radiation device is in the foreground with the beach in the background higher near the water : once the man approaches the water itself , the radiation spikes to at least 500 per cent safe levels he said snowstorms in 2012 also showed alert level radiation readings			2
the @entity1 findings prompted federal officials to launch an investigation , according to @entity57			1
health officials in @entity59 confirmed the spike – which was reaching over 150 micro-rem per hour - but said they were ‘ befuddled ’ about what had caused it			1
a video shows a man measuring radiation readings at different spots on the beach south of @entity69			2
background radiation in the areas immediately surrounding the beach are normal , but once the man approaches the water itself , the radiation spikes to at least 500 per cent safe levels and the @entity20 ’s alarm goes off			0
the man behind the video claims that on his previous visit to the same beach , radiation readings were 13 times the safe level			1
double : radiation counts per minute ( @entity28 ) taken in the snow this week in @entity21 , @entity14 , show levels double the normal numbers snowfall : the heavy snowfall in @entity21 , @entity14 , carried with it ' small particles of radioactive material ' which made the numbers jump to double officials have dismissed the possibility that it could be linked to @entity6 radiation reaching the west coast , despite forecasts by experts last summer that radioactive particles from @entity6 would reach @entity35 coastal waters in 2014			2
last week @entity98 reported that new plumes of radioactive steam were emerging from the crippled reactor number 3 at the plant , but @entity104 representatives refused to explain the cause			0
the @entity106 has ordered 14 million doses of potassium iodide , the compound that protects the body from radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of severe nuclear accidents , but a @entity106 official denied that the purchase was connected to the @entity6 crisis			0
lying : in september last year radiation readings around the @entity6 power plant were 18 times higher than previously reported by the plant 's officials preparing for ... ? the @entity106 has ordered 14 million doses of potassium iodide , which protects the body from radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of severe nuclear accidents the @entity35 @entity124 and @entity125 of @entity126 are investigating the cause of the radiation on the @entity1 beach			1
more information is expected to be released this week			0
@entity104 and the @entity7 government have repeatedly been caught lying in their efforts to downplay the scale of the @entity6 disaster			0
in september , a @entity136 report said that radiation readings around the power plant were 18 times higher than previously reported by @entity104			1
and after a tank leaked 300 tonnes of toxic water in august , groundwater radiation readings at the plant soared to 400,000 becquerels per litre , the highest reading since the nuclear accident occurred in march 2011 .			0
