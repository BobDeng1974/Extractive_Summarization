a separate probe was carried out by the @entity109 , an independent federal investigative agency which looks into claims by whistleblowers			0
among the most egregious instances was when the family of one marine asked to see his dead body one more time - and staff at @entity39 had hacked his arm bone off			1
the heat from a bomb attack in @entity12 had caused the soldier ’s arm to fuse at 90 degrees to his body so he was unable to fit into his uniform or his casket			2
but instead of speaking to his family to see what was for the best , staff went ahead and trimmed it anyway			0

the investigation found two body parts went missing entirely , including a piece of an ankle belonging to a soldier killed by a bomb in @entity138 and a small piece of flesh belonging to an airman who died in plane crash in @entity12 the investigation did not discover what happened to them - but raised the possibility they fell out of the plastic bags where they were being stored in the morgue refrigerator and got mixed in with the remains of others			1
the whistleblowers also drew attention to shipping of fetal remains belonging to relatives of military personnel back to the @entity2 instead of being transported in the more dignified aluminium cases they were shipped in re-used cardboard boxes			2
