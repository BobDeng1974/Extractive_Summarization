by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:19 pm on 5th january 2012 @entity2 today called on @entity3 to release all political prisoners and hold fair by - elections - as he became the first @entity7 minister to visit the country in 56 years			1
the foreign secretary met president @entity10 , who unexpectedly embarked on a series of liberalising measures after coming to office last year , and urged him to continue his reforms			1
@entity2 , who was pictured with pro-democracy leader @entity15 this afternoon prior to their formal meeting tomorrow , also spoke with his @entity3 counterpart @entity18			1
at that meeting , which came at the start of the two - day visit , he asked for ' concrete progress ' in two other areas - that aid groups have more access to areas of conflict and steps are made to resolve ethnic violence			2
friendship : @entity2 met with @entity3 pro-democracy leader @entity15 , whose party has been re-admitted back into the political process , at the @entity7 ambassador 's residence in @entity36 today discussions : @entity2 ( left ) spoke with @entity3 president @entity10 during a meeting at the president 's residence in @entity42 today talks : @entity2 ( left ) with his @entity3 counterpart @entity18 during a meeting in @entity42 today and he said that if the pledge for reforms , which began last year with the handing of power to a civilian government , continued then it would lead @entity3 to have deeper economic and political ties with the @entity52			1
@entity2 's visit is the first by a foreign minister from the former colonial power since 1955 , before the military takeover in what was known as @entity3 in 1962			1
it was made possible by the handover of power last year to a civilian government - albeit one stuffed with former military men and backed by the army - and a series of political and economic reforms since then			2
@entity2 said of his meeting with the president : ' i emphasised the importance the @entity7 government attaches to the reforms that the @entity3 government has undertaken in the last six months , and my sincere hope that there will be further progress in the weeks and months ahead			1
' i made clear that the @entity7 government expects to see the release of all political prisoners , credible by - elections in april , and a genuine alleviation of the suffering in ethnic areas , including through humanitarian access and peace talks			1
' i spoke of the long - standing friendship that exists between our two peoples , one that can and should form the foundation of improved relations across the board between our two countries			0
touch down : @entity2 pictured on his arrival at @entity93 at the start of an historic visit to @entity3 greetings : @entity2 is met by @entity3 deputy foreign minister @entity97 after arriving in @entity3 ' i made clear that the @entity7 government stands ready to respond positively to evidence of further progress towards that lasting improvement in human rights and political freedom that the people of @entity3 seek			1
' and of his meeting with @entity18 , he added : ' i have assured him that if they do ( continue the reforms ) , there will be a strongly positive response from the @entity7 and , i believe , the rest of the @entity112			2
' the foreign minister has reaffirmed commitments that have been made to release political prisoners			1
' he said the changes are irreversible and i welcome that way of thinking			0
i stressed that the world will judge the government by its actions			0
' @entity2 later spoke with @entity121 , the influential speaker of parliament and number three in the former junta			0
@entity121 then issued a statement acknowledging that not everyone was happy with the number of people released so far			0
he said : ' our parliament will continue to work so everyone can participate for democracy and development			0
' sustained political reform in @entity3 could pave the way for stiff economic sanctions to end and lead to @entity139 investment in natural resources , including oil and gas and other sectors			2
@entity3 's neighbours in @entity145 , especially @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 , are already rushing to tie up deals			0
@entity2 's trip follows one late last year by @entity152 secretary of state @entity151 , who promised concrete support from @entity154 if @entity3 moved faster on political reforms and the release of political prisoners			1
@entity7 has maintained a tough stand on human rights issues in @entity3 but expressed guarded optimism after the release in october last year of 230 political prisoners			1
just 12 political detainees were thought to have been freed this week among 900 prisoners released as an @entity166 gesture			1
as many as 600 may remain behind bars			0
arrival : @entity7 foreign secretary @entity2 is in @entity3 for two days of talks he hopes will end in all political prisoners being released sanctions : @entity152 secretary of state @entity151 met with president @entity10 in december last year @entity2 is due to hold talks tomorrow with @entity174 - educated pro-democracy leader and @entity175 peace laureate @entity15			1
the visit is a tricky balancing act for @entity2 , who will face criticism at home if he is seen as appeasing members of the former military regime slammed for its human rights record and brutal suppression of dissent			2
rights violations by the army are still reported from areas where it is fighting ethnic groups			0
opposition leader @entity15 today said @entity3 's government has approved her @entity192 to run in upcoming by - elections			1
@entity15 said in an interview at her residence that the party had been accepted			0
@entity192 spokesman @entity197 also said the party will start accepting new members on monday			0
@entity15 declined to say if she herself will stand in the election			2
the @entity192 boycotted general elections in 2010 because of restrictions			0
among other things , it would have prevented @entity15 from running			0
@entity205 , a prominent @entity3 analyst and former @entity7 diplomat , said : ' @entity207 ca n't appear to go soft			2
the @entity3 issue has become a political football at home and if he 's not forthright , he will be criticised			2
' but there 's a feeling that we have been battering away at the @entity3 for 22 years and not got anywhere			2
@entity7 is very much under the influence of the @entity152			0
' he also noted that @entity7 's discouragement of trade , tourism and investment was far heavier than that of the @entity112 in general			0
@entity7 firms in the energy and financial services sectors in particular are believed to be interested in @entity3 , but @entity2 's visit is likely to be little more than a testing of the waters before the @entity112 holds its annual sanctions review in april			1
@entity229 , director of the @entity7 @entity231 , said : ' @entity207 could offer some small concessions but at the moment , he 's there to deliver the message that lifting economic sanctions requires more genuine reforms			0
' @entity7 will be very careful			0
there 's broad support for engagement , but i do n't think they 'll move too fast			0
' analysts said @entity2 could discuss inducements such as development aid or humanitarian assistance , which , if supported by @entity15 , would be more acceptable to activists at home			1
@entity15 has shown a willingness to compromise in recent months , notably by agreeing to run as a candidate in an april 1 by - election after letting her @entity192 ( @entity192 ) party re-enter the political process .			1
