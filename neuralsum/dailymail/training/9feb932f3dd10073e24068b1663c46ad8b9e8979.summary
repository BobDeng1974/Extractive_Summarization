by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 08:37 est , 28 july 2013 with the launch of its first @entity2 boutique just months away , @entity2 fans of @entity4 fashion brand @entity3 will no longer be forced to rely on its website for their fashion fix			2
but while you wo n't have to go far to get your hands on the brand loved by @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 among others , you 'll be paying through the nose for the privilege			0
and it is n't just @entity3 that is charging @entity2 shoppers more than their @entity4 counterparts			0
other @entity4 brands including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are doing it too			2
expensive : getting your @entity3 fashion fix in the @entity2 costs up to 40 per cent more than it does in the @entity4 fans : @entity4 @entity30 editor @entity14 and first lady @entity13 are fans of the over-charging brand according to the @entity34 , which commissioned the study , the result is that buying @entity4 brands in @entity2 costs up to 50 per cent more than it would in the @entity4			1
at @entity3 , for example , a women 's collection cashmere button - back sweater costs $ 259.12 ( £ 169.80 ) if you 're a customer in @entity42			0
@entity2 buyers , however , pay £ 238.25 - a mark - up of a staggering 40 per cent			1
similarly , at @entity25 , you 'll find a leather drawstring backpack on sale for £ 115 in the @entity2 but just £ 89.18 in the @entity4			0
at @entity23 meanwhile , the brand 's practice of charging @entity2 customers the same price in pounds that @entity4 pay in dollars has resulted in mark - ups of 50 per cent or more			1
shocking : @entity23 make @entity2 buyers pay the dollar price but in pounds - a 50 % mark - up high price : @entity56 charge up to a third more for their rubber footwear on this side of the @entity59 the @entity62 dress , for example , costs $ 98 ( £ 64.22 ) at checkout on the brand 's @entity4 website but sells for £ 98 including delivery on the @entity2 equivalent - a huge price hike of 53 per cent			1
@entity3 say the higher costs take into account ' the inescapable fact that costs in the @entity2 are significantly higher than in the @entity4 '			2
but not everyone is convinced by their explanation , including @entity75 , founder of the @entity76 , who said : ' for some reason , @entity4 companies seem to think that the @entity2 public are able to pay a lot more than @entity4 consumers			1
' it certainly seems very unfair			0
in this economic crisis some people are having a bad time but others are still prepared to pay more for designer brands - and the @entity4 is cashing in on that market			0
