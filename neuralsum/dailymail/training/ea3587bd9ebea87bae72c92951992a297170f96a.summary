it 's no surprise that @entity2 heroes the @entity4 brothers have been announced in the @entity6 squad for this summer 's @entity7			1
the @entity9 - born and bred brothers will be going for gold in the triathlon - with their main competition one another			2
but while they are both keen to add @entity7 champion to their list of achievements , they are also hoping their sportsmanship can encourage others to get active			1
fun competition : the @entity4 brothers recommend families hold their own @entity7 in their gardens this summer @entity22 , 24 , told @entity23 : ' i remember getting up early to watch the @entity25 in 2000 and that really inspired me			1
i got up about 1am so i could watch the triathlon live and it made me really want to get out there and train			0
' the @entity7 is a massive opportunity for us to inspire kids in the same way			1
there was a massive take up in sport after the @entity36 and hopefully we 'll see the same thing happen this summer			0
it 's so important that we capitalise on the current climate of excitement ahead of the @entity7 to inspire kids to be more active			1
' @entity42 , 26 , who was originally hoping to compete in the 10k race in the @entity45 games as well as the triathlon ( before injury intervened ) , agreed			2
but he added that it 's not just children they want to encourage to get fit but their parents too			1
they teamed up with @entity53 to suggest fun activities families can do over the summer including creating their own @entity7 in their gardens , by staging relay races and long jump competitions between siblings and their friends			2
do n't just sit on the sofa ! the @entity62 hope they can inspire children to be more active being competitive is important - the brother 's sibling rivalry has certainly never done them any harm - but they point out it really is the taking part that counts			1
@entity42 said : ' we like to do as much as we can to help people to get fit and this is one way to do that and encourage people to be outside			2
' @entity42 added it 's important for parents to get involved , pointing out that along with his sporting heroes growing up like @entity76 , it was the adults in his life - his parents , teachers and coaches - who inspired him to become an @entity82			0
in turn , he inspired younger brother @entity22 to strive to be the best			0
research by @entity53 found that the @entity36 had a positive effect on more than 50 per cent of children in the @entity88 , inspiring them to work harder at school , join a sports club and spend more time outside			0
high profile sporting events this summer , including the @entity92 , which kicked off last week , and july 's @entity7 , are set to continue the trend and inspire a third of children and over a quarter of parents to be more active this summer			1
the @entity98 said they would love it if they could inspire more people to take up triathlon , which has only been an official part of the @entity7 since 2002			1
olympic gold and bronze : @entity42 , left , and @entity22 hope to repeat their success at the @entity7 @entity42 said they have definitely noticed an uptake in the sport , which involves swimming , cycling and running , since the @entity36 in which he took the gold and his brother the bronze			2
he said : ' everyone knows what it is now and many people will know someone who has done one			0
a lot more people follow it more so there has been a massive change			0
' the brothers have responded to the demand by setting up their own triathlon races called @entity128			2
the first race was held in @entity130 yesterday and will be followed by an event in @entity132 in september			0
the races are open to all abilities with ' super-sprint ( 400m open - water swim , 16km cycle , 2.5km run and ' sprint ' ( 750m open - water swim , 29.5km cycle , 5km run ) races on offer			0
the brothers said their own family inspired them to keep fit the brothers are also in the process of setting up their own charity - the @entity149 - which will offer free triathlons to children in partnership with schools to encourage participation in the sport from a young age			1
but while the brothers are keen to inspire others to be triathletes , @entity22 joked that he hoped it does n't lead to a protege stealling their thunder in the near future			0
he said : i would be pleased in a way but hopefully it will be a few years before the people we inspired start beating us ! ' visit www.facebook.com/warburtons for ideas on fun family activities to do this summer			0
