whatever you call them , it 's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic			0
@entity9 and @entity10 attract viewers , but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in @entity15			0
@entity16 are not consistently good enough to make @entity18 a regular spectacle			0
@entity21 football 's closest equivalent , @entity22 taking on @entity23 , is now merely a battle for the top four			0
but , on @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the @entity32 title race , but also easily lived up to it 's billing as @entity34			1
@entity28 players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game , after twice coming from behind to beat rivals @entity27 @entity39 gets up above @entity40 to power home the opening goal for @entity27 after half an hour @entity43 is congratulated by his team - mates after bringing @entity28 level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box @entity39 fires home his second goal past @entity50 after a mistake from @entity52 gave him a clear run on goal , to make it 2 - 1 @entity40 jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2 - 2 after @entity61 's mis - hit free kick @entity61 put pressure on @entity63 to force an own goal just two minutes later , as @entity28 went ahead for the first time in the game @entity27 : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity63 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 63 mins ) , @entity39 ( @entity76 71 ) , @entity77 ( @entity78 72 ) subs not used : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 goals : @entity39 30 , 43 booked : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity77 , @entity39 @entity28 : @entity85 , @entity40 , @entity86 , @entity87 ( @entity89 der @entity88 34 ) , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity43 , @entity93 ( @entity94 82 ) , @entity61 , @entity95 ( @entity96 59 ) , subs not used : @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 goals : @entity103 @entity104 , @entity105 51 booked : @entity52 , @entity93 in the end it was @entity28 who ran out winners , but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion , quality , and goals aplenty			1
the game was decided by a 130 - second burst soon after the half - time break , in which the visitors came from 2 - 1 down to go 3 - 2 ahead , with @entity61 , predictably , involved in both goals , though not perhaps , in the way that would be expected			1
first the @entity121 star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal , only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of @entity126 defender @entity40 , who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range			0
just two minutes later @entity61 might have been on hand to tap home @entity93 's low cross , but in the end his presence was enough to force defender @entity63 to divert it past his own goalkeeper			2
it felt harsh on @entity27 , who were the better side for large periods , but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the @entity28 backline			2
despite the hosts dominance of possession , the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals , such were their chances			0
@entity61 had several excellent opportunities , the last of which saw @entity67 pull off a remarkable save , while @entity93 should have scored at least once , and @entity67 also did well to deny @entity43 late on			0
all of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half , with @entity61 denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by @entity63 , @entity93 firing wide when clean through , and the woefully out of form @entity95 scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass			0
@entity61 ( left ) challenges for the ball against @entity63 in the crucial top of the table clash in @entity32 on @entity26 @entity167 gets a shot away under pressure from @entity52 of @entity28 in the @entity170 as @entity27 looked to take home advantage on the other hand it is difficult to remember @entity50 making too many meaningful saves in the second half , although he did acrobatically tip a @entity39 header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat - trick			1
with @entity182 having briefly gone top of the table by beating @entity185 earlier in the weekend , it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges			0
the result puts @entity190 's men top of @entity32 again , and is a serious dent to @entity27 's hopes			1
it all looked so different at half time , when an @entity39 double had his side 2 - 1 up			1
the local - born hero first rose above @entity40 at the back post to head past @entity50 on the half - hour , before slotting past the @entity198 shortly before half time to restore the lead			1
both goals had an element of fortune , with @entity39 climbing all over his defender to convert @entity167 's cross , and @entity52 gifting him possession through on goal for the second , but nonetheless he took both well			1
in between was the pick of the goals , a stunner from @entity43 , who cut inside beautifully , before curling in from the edge of the box , via the fingertips of @entity67 and the inside of the post			2
@entity28 's win was marred only by an injury to @entity87 , withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull			2
but a win over their fierce rivals , and the return to the table 's summit , will soften that blow			0
@entity87 is brought down , and the @entity126 defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious @entity27 took the lead twice in the first half , but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long @entity39 celebrates his second goal , and the @entity27 striker was only denied his hat - trick by an acrobatic save from @entity85 @entity61 looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the @entity237 champions , but his side kept responding to going behind @entity240 wheels away after scoring his goal , which made the score 2 - 2 early in the second half , and changed the momentum of the game the fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on , as @entity96 was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner the home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the @entity253 as they pursued the @entity237 title against their rivals			1

@entity39 puts @entity27 ahead on half - hour with powerful back - post header from @entity167 cross
@entity43 equalises five minutes later with a stunning strike from the edge of the box
@entity39 *capitalises* on *terrible* @entity28 defending to restore @entity27 's lead before half time
@entity40 brings @entity28 level again , before @entity63 own goal puts champions ahead moments later
