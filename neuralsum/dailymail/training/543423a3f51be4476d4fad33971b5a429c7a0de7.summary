by @entity0 a new ban on cheap alcohol is already failing because high - strength booze is still being sold for less than a bottle of water , experts said today			1
since monday retailers have been unable to sell lager or cider for less than 50p a can after ministers promised a new minimum pricing regime to end the ‘ worst examples of harmful drink ’			1
shops in @entity16 , @entity17 's worst town for alcohol - related illnesses and deaths , are selling cans of 7.5 per cent strength cider for 89p , while bottled water on their shelves is the same price or more			1
row : omega strong cider is being sold for 89p a can at @entity28 bargains in @entity16 , right , although this 89p price is above the new threshold , shocked health officials have said that @entity32 should already re-think his policy to save lives			1
an investigation has found that at least three shops in the seaside resort sold high - strength cans of cider or lager for less or the same price as a bottle of water			1
buy @entity44 , close to the pier , sells @entity46 for 89p			2
its manager @entity47 defended the policy and said : ' they are alcoholics so they do n’t mind if they buy it cheap or whatever , they would buy the cider if it was £ 20 '			1
the seaside resort is @entity17 's poorest and most deprived in terms of income , employment and health problems			0
alcohol is widely blamed and in the past two years 2,914 people were admitted to hospital with alcohol - related illnesses and 140 died - the highest figures by population in @entity17			0
the town 's @entity63 says it has seen an increase in the number of people being rushed there in alcohol - induced comas or liver failure			0
@entity72 @entity16 's alcohol lead @entity73 said : ' minimum prices would have minimal effect on the average person – something like 12p a week – but it would deter young vulnerable people from buying cheap , strong alcohol			1
' high strength , low cost alcohol tends to be drunk by people with an alcohol problem and younger people who want to get as much alcohol as cheaply as possible because they have limited means			0
' minimum prices need to come in through legislation , but in the mean time responsible traders should be looking at stopping selling strong alcohol			1
the industry needs to take some responsibility – a dead customer is no customer at all '			0
admissions : by population more people are taken @entity16 's @entity63 with alcohol - related illnesses than anywhere else in @entity17 @entity16 's public health chief , dr @entity100 , has called on @entity32 to rethink minimum pricing to save lives			1
under his original plans a can of lager would have retailed for £ 1.56 , wine for £ 4.22 and spirits for £ 12.60			2
but the prime minister faced strong opposition from within the @entity110 , as ministers warned it could unfairly hit responsible drinkers on lower incomes			0
so the prime minister ’s proposal – which would have fixed the cost of a unit of alcohol at 45p – was dumped last summer			0
instead cans must be at least 50p each , bottles of wine £ 2.24 and 750ml bottles of vodka or whisky £ 10.16			1
the new system works by banning shops and pubs from selling alcohol at less than the total cost of the duty payable to the @entity132 , plus vat			2
but experts say it will have a minimal effect			0
on average , each adult is expected to drink just 0.04 per cent less over the course of the year			0
so - called ‘ hazardous drinkers ’ – those who consume more than the recommend safe limits – are predicted to consume just 0.1 per cent less			2
but dr @entity142 , mp for @entity143 and campaigner on alcohol pricing , said the effect of the new regime would be ‘ minuscule ’			0
‘ i just do not think the evidence is there to support it when you are comparing it with the effect of minimum unit pricing , ’ she said .			2

since monday shops must sell cans of lager or cider for at least 50p each
a shop in @entity16 is selling *super-strength* cider for 89p
while it is above the new threshold it is still less than a bottle of water
the cheap rate has shocked @entity72 officials who have called on @entity32 to re-think minimum pricing after new ban this week
