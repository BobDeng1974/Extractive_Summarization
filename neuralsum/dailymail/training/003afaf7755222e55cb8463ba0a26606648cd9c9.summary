by @entity0 plans to raise the motorway speed limit to 80mph have been consigned to the slow lane amid fears it may alienate women voters and increase risks on the road			1
the policy was launched with a fanfare in 2011 by then transport secretary @entity11 , who claimed the 70mph limit had been ' discredited ' and a rise to 80mph would boost the economy			1
but @entity15 , who now fills the @entity17 post , says the move is no longer a priority			1
cars whizz along the @entity21 : a plan to increase the motorway speed limit to 80mph , first mooted just two years ago , has been ditched over fears it would increase risks on the road and alienate women voters the decision will anger many drivers who , polling shows , mostly want higher speeds , but it has already been welcomed by road safety groups and environmental campaigners			1
in an interview with the @entity35 today , mr @entity15 said the plan had been ditched			1
' look , that 's not a priority , to be absolutely honest , ' he said			2
' you would have to do trials in certain areas so it 's not something that 's a high priority			2
' a source close to the @entity44 told the newspaper : ' this is not going to happen with @entity15 as @entity44			1
' safety is paramount to him and his view of how to run the roads and he would not be confident about how you would do it			0
' the prime minister 's inner circle is said to fear that an increase in the speed limit could alienate women voters			2
polls have shown a majority of drivers would support the move , but significant numbers of women were against it			1
mr @entity11 had originally announced the plan at the 2011 @entity66 party conference , saying the 70mph limit had resulted in millions of motorists routinely breaking the law , undermining the principle of policing by consent			1
' safety is paramount to him ' : transport secretary @entity15 , who said the plan to increase the limit was ' not a priority ' he said : ' the limit was introduced way back in 1965 - when the typical family car was a @entity78			1
' he claimed a rise to 80mph would ' restore the legitimacy ' of the system and benefit the economy by ' hundreds of millions of pounds '			2
former roads minister @entity83 last may said he would set up trials for the higher speed limit on parts of the motorway network , and only last week @entity88 , his successor , told a motoring forum the plan was still alive			2
the @entity91 said it was disappointed with the decision to drop the speed limit increase			0
motoring groups had argued that 80mph is a safe speed in a modern car , providing drivers leave enough room between vehicles			0
but last year campaign groups estimated that raising the motorway speed limit to 80mph would cost society an extra £ 1billion a year , including £ 766million in fuel bills and more than £ 62million in health costs			0
the groups , which include road safety charity @entity108 , the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) and @entity111 , also estimated that the higher limit would lead to 25 extra deaths and 100 serious injuries a year , as well as 2.2 million more tonnes of carbon emissions			0
professor @entity117 , director of the @entity118 , said : ' the real stumbling block is likely to have been enforcement			0
' police already tend to give speeding drivers some leeway , so it was quite feasible that an 80 mph limit would have actually meant 90 mph in practice and that proved a step too far for ministers			0
' @entity130 transport secretary @entity129 said : ' the chaos over plans to change motorway speed limits is extraordinary , even by the @entity135 's usual standards			1
' only a week after the roads minister confidently claimed that trials of a new 80mph speed limit were to go ahead , it 's clear that the @entity140 has applied the brakes on his own reckless policy			0
' @entity144 has consistently warned that a blanket increase in the motorway speed limit risked increasing deaths and serious injuries , pushing up the cost of driving and making it harder to cut the emissions that contribute to climate change			0
' the ending of all government funding for road safety and speed cameras , while slashing the numbers of road traffic police , meant there was no realistic prospect of any increase being credibly enforced			0
' ministers should now end the confusion they have created and clearly rule out any increase in speed limits in this parliament			0
