the @entity0 has been urged to reveal its plans for @entity3 independence amidst fears the licence fee could double in the event of a ' yes ' vote in next week 's referendum			1
@entity9 has so far refused to speculate on what could happen after thursday 's vote , insisting that no contingency plans have been drawn up			1
however , senior politicians have called for transparency over the future level of the licence fee , in order to ensure that @entity3 voters can make a well - informed decision at the polls			1
there are also questions over the future of the many @entity0 programmes which are currently produced at the @entity9 's @entity3 headquarters in @entity26 - including hit sitcom @entity27 and political flagship @entity29			1
the @entity52 has repeatedly insisted that an independent @entity3 would be able to keep the @entity0 , along with other @entity54 institutions such as the @entity55 and the @entity56			2
but as the @entity9 would no longer be able to subsidise @entity3 services from the rest of @entity54 , it is not know how the level of the licence fee would be affected			1
the @entity62 reported today that a secret internal document produced by the @entity0 in 2011 suggested the fee might have to double from £ 145.50 to nearly £ 300 in an independent @entity3			1
a source told the paper : ' in @entity3 , revenue raised is well south of the value of services they receive			0
' the @entity0 is believed to raise around £ 320million from the 2.2million @entity3 licence fee payers , according to the latest available figures			1
most of that money goes on programmes and services broadcast to the whole of the @entity54 , but £ 102million is spent every year on content intended for an exclusively @entity3 audience			0
the @entity0 's @entity81 tv station , @entity82 , is part - funded by the @entity3 government , but its other services in the country draw from the overall pot of licence fee payments			1
silence : @entity89 , incoming chairman of the @entity0 , has supported the @entity9 's policy of refusing to plan for an independence vote in other countries of a comparable size to @entity3 , such as @entity96 and @entity97 , public broadcasting is nearly twice as expensive per head of population as it is in the @entity54			1
the licence fee is @entity97 is 2,414 krone , around £ 260 , while in @entity96 the € 160 ( £ 130 ) fee makes up only half the income of the public broadcaster @entity104			2
@entity0 channels which are broadcast outside the @entity54 , such as @entity106 and @entity107 , are funded by advertising			0
the @entity109 is one of the key dates in the calendar of @entity54 patriotism - but this year , the @entity0 is keen to keep politics out of it altogether			0
presenter and stars of tomorrow night 's concert , including @entity118 and @entity119 , are set to be reminded that they must focus on the music - and not mention the @entity3 independence referendum			2
politicians and cultural figures have called for the @entity109 to be a celebration of @entity125 ahead of next thursday 's poll			2
but the @entity0 is adamant that it must remain an apolitical event , and will brief those appearing to remind them not to talk about ' things that are n't music related '			0
@entity9 insists that this is standard guidance issued every year , but tomorrow 's concert is considered particularly symbolic due to the impending referendum			0
historian @entity135 said this week that the @entity109 ' might be the last time ' for the @entity54 to come together as a whole , and suggested that the historic occasion should be celebrated			0
politicians such as culture secretary @entity139 , and entertainers including @entity141 , agreed that the concert should display the strengths of the @entity51 and @entity3 's contribution to national culture			0
' the best way of sharing our cultural lives is to stay together , ' @entity146 told the @entity150			0
' @entity151 was written by a @entity152 ! this concert is a wonderful opportunity to share our musical heritage			0
' however , the @entity0 is so intent on staying impartial that several of its best - known personalities are believed to have refused show support for the @entity51 in case they breach the @entity9 's rules			0
' it 's business as usual for the @entity109 , ' a @entity0 spokesman said			0
' there is no heavy edict not to mention the referendum - as is standard , if it was editorially justified on the night it would be reflected			0
' in line with previous years presenters and artists will be reminded that the @entity109 is a music event not a political platform			0
' @entity172 , the former culture secretary , urged the @entity0 to publish information about the future of the licence fee before the referendum vote			1
' the future of the @entity0 in @entity3 and the level of the licence fee was raised with me on the doorstep when i was campaigning in @entity3 this week , ' he told the @entity62			1
' if @entity3 wish to keep a @entity3 @entity0 or something like it in the event of independence , they will lose the @entity0 's economy of scale and will face paying much more if they wish to keep quality public service broadcasting			2
' a @entity0 source told @entity190 that there had been no attempts to supress any internal reports , adding that the @entity9 had made no decisions on the future of the licence fee			1
the @entity0 's incoming chairman @entity196 told mps this week that it was right to delay plans for the future until after the referendum vote , in order to remain impartial during the independence campaign			1
a spokesman said : ' as we have consistently stated we have done no planning about the future of @entity0 services after the referendum , including any calculations about the level of a licence fee			1
' as well as questions over the licence fee , a ' yes ' vote in the referendum could cast doubt over the future of @entity0 programmes which are produced in @entity3			1
mrs @entity27 , starring @entity96 comedian @entity220 , is filmed in a studio in @entity26 , and @entity29 's producers are based in @entity3 although the programme moves around the @entity54 for each episode			0
other popular programmes produced by @entity39 have included school drama @entity226 and detective series @entity228			2
last month , @entity3 tv producers spoke out against the @entity0 's refusal to plan for the future , saying it could leave the creative arts industry in limbo for up to two years			2
a spokesman for @entity236 , the anti-independence campaign group , said the uncertainty over the @entity0 could jeopardise the ' good deal ' currently enjoyed by @entity3 audiences			0
' the @entity0 is one of the most respected national institutions we have and people in @entity3 do n't support @entity38 's plan to break it up , ' he said			2
' licence fee payers in @entity3 contribute around £ 320million a year but we benefit from programming and production worth £ 3.6billion			1
that 's a good deal for @entity3			0
' but @entity250 , chief executive of @entity251 , said : ' the current @entity3 government has made it absolutely clear that the licence fee payable in @entity3 at the point of independence will be the same as the rest of the @entity54			1
' in an independent @entity3 , viewers will continue to receive the programmes and channels currently enjoyed , but with significantly more programmes being commissioned and produced in @entity3			0

reports suggest licence fee in @entity3 could double to nearly £ 300
but the @entity0 insists it has made no contingency plans for the *possibility* of a ' yes ' vote in thursday 's referendum
*ex-minister* urges the corporation to publish plans before the vote
popular programmes like @entity34 are currently produced in @entity3
businesses today spoke out against costs of independence while @entity47 called on the @entity49 to step in
