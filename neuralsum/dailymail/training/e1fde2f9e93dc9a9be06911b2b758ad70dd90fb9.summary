four huge castles in @entity1 are among the palatial properties north of the border which would not be hit by the mansion tax - while a two - bedroom flat in central @entity6 would be , it emerged today			1
the row over @entity10 's planned levy has intensified in recent days after the party 's new @entity1 leader @entity11 boasted that he would boost the @entity13 in @entity1 by using up to £ 250million raised from the controversial tax in @entity15			1
labour shadow chancellor @entity16 has suggested a £ 2million threshold would be placed on the tax , with the owners of properties priced above that value taking a hit			0
but low property prices in @entity1 mean even the owners of the 17 - bedroom baronial @entity25 mansion house in @entity27 and @entity28 - which is currently on the market for £ 1.4million - would get out of paying the charge			1
@entity31 in @entity32 dates from the 14th century and has eight reception rooms and nine bedrooms - but its £ 1.65million price tag means it would be unaffected by @entity10 's planned mansion tax , which it has been suggested would only affect properties over a £ 2million threshold @entity39 near @entity40 has seven bedrooms and a separate ' gardeners cottage ' in its sprawling grounds			1
but at £ 1.35million , its owners would also not have to pay the planned charge according to estate agents , @entity47 is ' a fine example of a late 15th century four - storey towerhouse , with a stone circular stairway ' similarly , the nine - bedroom , eight - reception room £ 1.65million @entity53 in @entity32 , which comes with an outdoor swimming pool , tennis court and walled garden , would also avoid the tax			1
the sprawling £ 1.65million @entity61 mansion in @entity62 near @entity27 , which boasts , according to estate agents , ' unprecedented views over the sea and surrounding countryside ' and the turreted £ 1.35million @entity39 near @entity40 would also not incur the levy			0
however , in @entity6 - where critics of the tax have pointed out that even owners of modest homes would face the charge - some small flats are priced above the £ 2million threshold			2
a two - bedroom , fifth - floor flat in @entity75 apartment block , @entity73 is currently on the market for £ 2.1million , meaning its eventual owners will have to pay if the tax if it is brought in			2
the discrepancy is one of the reasons why some of @entity6 's @entity10 mps have hit out at mr @entity11 's claims of extra money for @entity1			1
@entity61 , @entity62 , near @entity27 , is a @entity86 house with a cobbled courtyard and a famous coastal garden			0
it is one of the ' palatial ' mansions whose relatively low price compared to properties in south east @entity15 mean they would be exempt from the mansion tax seller says @entity61 has ' a classical @entity86 entrance with good decorative stone detail ' and ' beautifully proportioned ' reception rooms similarly @entity99 , a baronial mansion overlooking the @entity101			0
despite having seventeen bedrooms , it is valued at £ 1.4million estate agents say @entity25 is ' a fine example of a mansion house built in the @entity108 style popular in the @entity109 ' former @entity10 leadership candidate @entity110 accused mr @entity11 of trying to ‘ buy @entity1 votes with money expropriated from @entity6 ’			2
and former labour cabinet minister @entity113 warned him against treating the @entity114 as a ‘ cash cow ’			0
@entity117 mp @entity116 added his voice to the @entity10 dissenters today when he told the @entity120 : ' why should the landed gentry in @entity1 , or someone with a place as large as @entity124 , get away scot - free ? ' @entity10 ’s new mansion tax will levy an annual charge on all properties valued at more than £ 2million			1
full details have yet to be announced , but shadow chancellor @entity16 said last year that homes worth between £ 2million and £ 3million will face an annual bill of £ 3,000 , regardless of income			0
critics warn that the tax will disproportionately hit @entity6 and the @entity114 , where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans			0
fewer than 900 homes in @entity1 would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the @entity139 total			0
meanwhile in @entity6 , a fifth - floor , two - bedroom apartment in @entity73 's @entity141 has been valued at £ 2.1million , making it eligible			2

cheap property prices in @entity1 mean even sprawling mansions would not be hit by @entity10 's planned charge
online searches show *historic* castles with swimming pools and tennis courts in their grounds would avoid levy
but in @entity6 , where property prices are *notoriously* high , even two - bedroom apartments will face the tax
@entity159 from the *capital* have hit out at the party 's @entity1 leader over claims he *'ll* use the money for the @entity13
