shadow home secretary @entity0 will point out it has not been helpful for ' liberal commentators ' to say concern about immigration is ' irrational ' @entity7 will today attack ' liberal commentators ' who are too quick to dismiss the public 's ' genuine ' concerns about mass immigration			1
@entity12 's party has repeatedly come under fire for trying to close down debate about immigration by labelling its opponents ' bigots '			2
but in a speech today , the shadow home secretary will say there is a need for a frank and honest discussion			1
in particular , @entity0 will point out that it has not been helpful for ' liberal commentators and business advocates ' to say concern about immigration is ' irrational '			2
she will go on to say : ' too often the debate about immigration becomes polarised and unhealthy			2
on the one hand we now have an arms race of rhetoric involving the @entity32 and @entity33 over immigration			0
@entity33 are exploiting people 's fears , fuelling anxiety and division , and @entity38 is racing to catch up			1
' on the other hand some people seem to think talking about immigration at all is a problem and they dismiss people 's genuine concerns			0
' mrs @entity0 will also promise that , under a @entity7 government , 1,000 extra immigration staff would be recruited to protect @entity47 's porous borders			1
controversially , they would be paid for by imposing a £ 10 visa waiver charge on visitors from overseas			1
@entity7 said the charge would apply to people coming from countries such as the ' @entity54 , @entity55 and the @entity56 ' who are trusted to return home at the end of a holiday or a short business trip			0
last night @entity7 insisted the policy could work , pointing out that @entity54 imposes a $ 14 charge on visitors to @entity54 , including @entity47			2
it costs the @entity54 around $ 4 to process each application and the additional $ 10 is used to fund government programmes			0
a @entity7 spokesman said : ' this reform was not beyond the wit of the @entity54 civil service , so the @entity32 really need to examine their basic competence and ambitions for reform			0
' however @entity75 officials claimed the scheme would cost ' more to operate than it would recover in fees ' – and said the charge would pay for only 59 extra staff			0
home secretary @entity87 said : ' @entity7 would take @entity47 backwards and risk a surge in both legal and illegal immigration			1
this disastrous policy launch shows @entity7 are n't remotely ready for the responsibility of government			0
' mrs @entity0 's speech is likely to be seen as an attempt by @entity7 to regain some credibility on immigration amid alarm at the way @entity33 is eating into its core vote			1
following @entity33 coming within 617 votes of taking @entity102 and @entity103 from @entity7 , senior politicians have been speaking more openly about mass immigration			0
last week @entity12 declared : ' it is n't prejudiced to worry about the effects of immigration			0
' mrs @entity0 will also promise that , under a @entity7 government , 1,000 extra immigration staff would be recruited to protect @entity47 's porous borders			1
