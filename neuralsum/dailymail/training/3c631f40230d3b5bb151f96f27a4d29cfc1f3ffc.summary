it is an issue that arouses high emotions			0
but the archbishop of @entity4 ’s opposition to gay marriage provoked a response from a fellow man of the cloth that was anything but holy			1
not only that , the outburst was recorded on @entity12 for all to see			2
so outraged was the @entity13 after @entity14 spoke in the @entity15 against the proposed same - sex marriage law that he condemned him on the social networking site as a ‘ w * * * * * ’			1
row : rev @entity13 ( left ) turned on the archbishop of canterbury @entity14 and called him a ' w * * * * r ' after he spoke against gay marriage in the @entity15 ( right ) this week row : @entity22 called on the archbishop to resign and called him a w * * * * r in this post on @entity12 he also went further , describing the choice of archbishop @entity14 to lead the @entity26 as a ‘ massive mistake ’			1
the church has since admonished him – by leaving another @entity12 message under his original posting			2
on monday archbishop @entity14 said the @entity31 would effectively abolish the traditional institution of marriage , which he said was a cornerstone of society			2
he said it would create ‘ different and unequal ’ forms of marriage			0
in response mr @entity13 , who like the archbishop trained for the priesthood at @entity42 , @entity43 , called for a petition urging him to resign			2
he wrote : ‘ what really upsets me is nasty people such as @entity14 robbing me of my faith in the church , he does not speak in my name and i think he is a w * * * * * , but i ’m not going to stop being a @entity51 or a priest			1
’ rant : @entity22 then called for a petition to force @entity14 out of the job at the top of the church the posting came to the attention of church officials , one of whom admonished mr @entity13 in a follow - up posting			2
the @entity64 , director of communications at the church ’s headquarters in @entity67 , wrote : ‘ clearly you are upset with the political stance of the @entity26 leadership			0
defence : @entity14 was defended by his pr team who said : ' whilst i am sure this will be water off a duck 's back for archbishop @entity14 , i do n't think calling someone a w * * * * * is the best way of engaging ' ' however that is no justification for your language and vitriol			1
calling another @entity51 a w * * * * * does n’t work for me as a priestly response			1
‘ i hope you might find time to reconsider the expression of your anger and delete some of these posts			0
’ mr @entity13 replied : ‘ i will			0
i do n’t know you at all but i see you are director of comms , please specify exactly what you wish me to withdraw and i will oblige			0
’ mr @entity64 responded : ‘ how about removing the line about @entity14 “ a w * * * * * ” ? ’ he later added : ‘ any right minded person would find a priest calling his archbishop an onanist to be utterly outrageous			1
’ mr @entity13 , who is not currently licensed to officiate because he is a full - time carer , said later : ‘ why is the church , after the whole women bishops debacle , now excluding people who actually want to get married ? ‘ i suspect many bishops , clergy and laity support gay marriage but we do not have a vote			1
’ last night mr @entity64 said : ‘ the issue of same - sex marriage is an emotive one			0
' there are a variety of views within the @entity26 and much of that debate takes place online			0
‘ while i am sure this will be water off a duck ’s back for archbishop @entity14 , i think it was right to challenge @entity13 ’s approach			1
’ the @entity121 passed the @entity15 on tuesday by a voting ratio of 2 - 1			0
a ‘ wrecking ’ amendment designed to block the @entity124 which was tabled by the crossbench @entity126 was defeated by 390 votes to 148 .			0

*reverend* @entity13 took to @entity12 to demand @entity14 quits
the archbishop had just spoken against gay marriage in the @entity15
' he does not speak in my name and i think he is a w * * * * r ' , he wrote online
cofe *bosses* then message him to take it down because it was not ' priestly '
' any right minded person would find a priest calling his archbishop an onanist to be utterly outrageous , ' head of communications told him
