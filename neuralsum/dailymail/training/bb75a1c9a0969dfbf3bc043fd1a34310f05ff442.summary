animal rights group @entity0 has been accused of stealing a family 's beloved dog , driving away and then killing it by the pet 's distraught owners			1
surveillance footage appears to show the animal rights group taking away @entity7 – a @entity8 – from the front porch of her family 's trailer in @entity13 , @entity14			1
and according to @entity16 , whose daughter has been distraught since @entity18 left , two @entity0 representatives knocked on his door three days later to tell him his dog had been killed			1
@entity16 said : ' my chihuahua , when she sees my car , she come to me			1
that saturday she did not come			0
' ' i was angry			0
i understand they pick up my dog , [ sic ] if it was in a tree or another place , but this is in my house			0
' footage dated october 18 shows a @entity0 van pulling up to house 's driveway			1
a woman is seen getting out , approaching the home , then leaving moments later with something in her arms			0
despite dozens of requests for comment from local and national media , the group is yet to issue a statement on @entity18 's removal and death			1
@entity31 reported @entity0 to the police , and the local sheriff filed larceny charges			2
@entity14 has specific provisions in law for the theft of dogs or other domesticated animals			2
silence : @entity0 has refused to respond to repeated request to explain the alleged actions but after the case was passed on to the commonwealth attorney 's office to handle , it was dropped because the evidence was not strong enough			2
@entity0 has a history of killing large percentages of the animals in its possession – a process it defends because it claims to be the ' shelter of last resort '			0
on its website , a statement says : ' when impoverished families can not afford to pay a veterinarian to let a suffering and / or aged animal leave this world , @entity0 will help			0
' when an aggressive , unsocialized dog has been left to starve at the end of a chain with a collar grown into his neck and his body racked with mange , @entity0 will spare him from dying slowly and miserably in someone 's backyard			0
' but annual reports on @entity0 's track record caring for animals show that more than 97 per cent of creatures in its care were killed since 1998			1
some 1,792 such animals were put to death at its headquarters in @entity117 , @entity14 , in 2013 alone , pushing the total death toll , which has risen further since , beyond 31,000 .			0
