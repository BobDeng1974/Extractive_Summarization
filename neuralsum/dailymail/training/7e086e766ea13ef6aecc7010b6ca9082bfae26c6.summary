if home really is where the heart is then @entity3 can prepare to be confused as @entity5 attempt to get their @entity7 campaign back on track at home to @entity10 on wednesday			1

‘ no more assistant , ’ said @entity3 , a rugged figure in double - denim with his grey hair swept back to his collar as it was when he played			1
he is ready to manage			0
‘ the stress does n’t matter , ’ the 44 - year - old added			1
‘ it ’s part of football			2
i learned that you have to confront it if you ’re to be successful			0
‘ i listened to my managers taken something from them all : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ; all different approaches			0
it all comes to this point			0
‘ i worked closely for eight months with @entity18			0
by the end of the season we had the team settled and looking good but you never know what is going to happen			0
’ @entity3 began is career with boyhood club @entity10 in 1987 former @entity10 manager @entity52 instructs @entity3 to let others do the running except , at @entity10 you can have a good guess if you finish one place behind @entity67 , their fierce rivals from the @entity70 side of the @entity71			1
‘ the club has no patience , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ in @entity30 , you have to win the title every year			2
that is the only measure of success			0
in @entity78 , it is more about what the manager thinks ; his philosophy			0
‘ i remember at @entity82 once , we lost 10 games at home in a season and there was no - one calling for the manager to be sacked			1
in @entity30 it is all about the scoreboard			0
it ’s a cultural thing			0
in @entity30 , we think with our hearts			0
’ @entity3 has never been one to talk much , preferring to go about his business on the field , but he has seen fiery moments when the passions of @entity97 and @entity98 football mixed			1
he saw @entity52 plant an enormous red - and - gold flag in the centre circle at @entity67 ’s @entity103 stadium after @entity10 had beaten their rivals to win the @entity19 in 1996			1
‘ he knew what that derby meant , ’ said @entity3			1
@entity10 fans create an intimidating atmosphere during a game against fierce rivals @entity67 @entity52 almost caused a riot after planting a @entity10 flag on the pitch after @entity19 win in 1996 ‘ it is one of the biggest rivalries in the world and it does n’t stop at the stadium gates			1
i do n’t know what went through his head , but now it ’s part of the history of the club			2
in @entity30 , we ca n’t bear losing			0
sometimes things go wrong because there ’s so much passion			2
it ’s how we ’re brought up			0
’ @entity3 was reared at the old @entity131			1
it was demolished in 2010 as @entity10 moved to the @entity133			1
the new place is nearly twice as big , but memories of the intimidating atmosphere at the old ground still send a tingle down the spine			0
‘ it was special , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ the hairs would stand up on your arms			0
it was an atmosphere completely different to anywhere else			0
the new stadium looks like the @entity147 , but the fans are the same and they still get behind their team , always			2
’ he was playing for @entity10 in the infamous 0 - 0 draw in 1993 which knocked @entity151 out of the @entity152 on away goals			1
@entity151 ’s players claimed they were attacked by riot police sent to shield them from fans who lit flares and hurled missiles			2
‘ the police went to protect them , not to do harm , ’ said @entity3 and believes that victory was crucial to the development of the team — and @entity98 football			1
‘ @entity151 were a big club , with big history			2
no - one gave us a chance			2
i remember reports afterwards about how @entity151 ’s shares had gone down — the result caused financial damage			0
’ @entity3 faced his former club @entity10 in the @entity152 after moving to @entity175 in 1999 the @entity98 midfielder enjoyed a successful career playing in the @entity28 with @entity82 2001 - 09 @entity3 tastes a typical @entity179 ' challenge while playing for @entity30 against @entity78 @entity52 , in charge at @entity10 for the 1995 - 96 campaign , regrets missing the chance to develop @entity3 ’s generation			1
it would evolve to beat @entity5 in the @entity186 final in 2000 — although @entity3 had joined @entity175 by then — and many of those players formed the nucleus of the @entity30 team that reached the 2002 @entity192 semi-finals			1
‘ if you ask for my favourite memory it is always the @entity192 , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ to come so close was spectacular			0
’ when @entity30 met @entity78 in the qualifiers for @entity198 , it was another tense affair with players clashing in the tunnel after @entity3 conceded a first - half penalty , which was missed by @entity203			1
by this time , after 18 months at @entity204 , @entity3 was at @entity82 , again with @entity52 , who also signed @entity205 , another @entity10 star			1
@entity206 was soon back in @entity13 , but @entity3 spent eight years in @entity207 with wife @entity208 and their two children			2
his football thrived in @entity78 with his understanding of the shape of the game around him and ability to control it			2
‘ when i moved to @entity82 , @entity52 told me to play simple and let everybody else do the running , ’ he said			2
‘ maybe this is why i stayed so long — but it was always one of my aims to be a manager			0
’ @entity3 takes a walk with his daughter to thank @entity82 fans after playing his final game for the club @entity16 ( @entity32 ) , pictured here for @entity10 against @entity230 , was the best player @entity3 ever played with @entity232 coach and former @entity234 midfielder @entity231 was @entity3 's role model as a player @entity3 played until he was 38 and won 94 caps			1
when asked for the best he played with , he mentions @entity237 and @entity238 before settling on @entity239 maestro @entity16			0
‘ he was a great person who never once hid behind his name , ’ he said			0
when @entity3 quit playing in 2009 , @entity51 gave him a coaching role at @entity243 ’s academy			2
since then , he has coached in @entity30 ’s national academy as well as at @entity10			1
if his next job is in @entity97 , he will be delighted			0
he holds a @entity97 passport and 19 - year - old son @entity248 studies in @entity23 and daughter @entity249 , 11 , was born in the city			1
as a player , he always sought to model his style on @entity231			0
‘ how he ran , where he ran , the spaces he played in , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ he played like a man with four eyes			0
’ if he emulates @entity231 ’s coaching career as successfully as he did his playing style , this could be the start of something big .			0
