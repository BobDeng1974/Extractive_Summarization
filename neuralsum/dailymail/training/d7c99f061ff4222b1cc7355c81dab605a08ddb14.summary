by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 5 november 2013 the son of @entity3 victim @entity2 has revealed that his mother 's death in 1972 still haunts him - more than four decades after her murder			1
@entity7 says he still suffers nightmares about the day mrs @entity2 , a 38 - year - old mother of ten , was abducted by @entity11 @entity10 paramilitaries and executed			1
speaking in @entity14 documentary @entity12 , mr @entity7 also talked of his life after his mother 's murder , which orphaned her children and condemned them to a childhood in care			1
nightmares : @entity7 says he has never been able to overcome seeing his mother dragged away mr @entity7 and his sister @entity23 also remembered the harrowing events of the day their mother was taken and offered memories of the family life that was denied them			1
' there were ten of us all in one bedroom , like ten wee rats , ' remembers mr @entity7 of his childhood			1
' at that point of life , we had n't got much but we had each other			2
' but all that was to change			2
his mother , a @entity41 widow who had been married to a @entity43 man and who lived in the staunchly @entity10 @entity45 in @entity46 , took pity on an @entity48 soldier injured during one of the street battles that characterised the @entity51			1
' my ma put a cushion under his head , ' says mr @entity7			1
' my ma would have helped anyone , that 's just the kind of person she was			2
' that 's where it all started to go wrong for us			2
' just days after the incident , the @entity3 came calling			1
@entity2 was enjoying a game of bingo when she was called out and told that one of her children had been injured			1
a car was waiting outside to take her to hospital			0
but it was a trap			0
in the early hours of the following morning , @entity2 was found wandering the streets , badly beaten and disoriented			1
family : @entity2 poses for a picture with three of her ten children the year before she was killed lonely : the remote spot on @entity78 in @entity79 where @entity2 's body was finally found ' there was a lot of blood on her and her face was all swollen and everything			1
black and blue , ' remembers daughter @entity23			0
' we got her a cup of tea and her cigarettes ... and she must have smoked the cigarettes one after the other as she drank her tea , and she started to get sick , sick with her nerves			0
' later that day , the @entity3 came back for @entity2 , but this time there would be no return home			1
mr @entity7 remembers : ' around teatime , a rap came on the door			1
' she was in the bathroom getting washed and they were shouting " where is she ? where is she ? "			0
' she was screaming , ' says @entity23			0
' she was screaming her head off			0
she was shouting : " help me " , " help me "			0
mr @entity7 adds : ' @entity108 [ children ] was wrapped round her			1
all of us was crying and squealing			0
i remember one of the [ paramilitary ] girls talking and i remember [ her ] because she had n't got a mask on , and she used to be a neighbour of ours			0
' they kept trying to calm us down because they knew us , and they knew us by name			0
' going home : 31 years after her terrible death , the body of @entity2 was finally recovered eventually , @entity2 was forced out of the house and down into the road			1
@entity23 and @entity7 's older brother @entity128 attempted to follow their mother but the @entity3 men put a gun to his head and ordered him away ' we could her her screaming , still screaming , and we looked over the bannister down from the block of flats , and there she was , getting thrown into the back of a red van and that was the last time i actually saw her , ' says @entity23			1
later that day , a single shot to the back of the head ended @entity2 's life and her body was buried in a shallow , unmarked grave			1
her 10 children were now orphans			2
mr @entity7 said : ' i think it was about five days later , an @entity3 man came to the door , rapped on the door , and handed over my mother 's purse and her wedding rings			1
' i asked him where my mother was and he said , " look , i was just told to bring these rings to you			2
i know nothing about it " and that was it , [ he ] walked away			0
' @entity23 adds : ' i knew she was n't going to come back			0
i knew straight away when the first knock came through			0
i knew then , no return			0
' with their mother gone , the children were left isolated			1
@entity170 and the local priest were unwilling to help and unsympathetic to their plight , as official documents that date from the time reveal			0
inquest : mr @entity7 addresses the media after an inquest found that his mother was not a @entity48 spy at rest : mr @entity7 ( left ) and his brothers carry their mother 's coffin at her funeral in 2003 between 1972 and 1982 , ' disappearing ' people thought to be @entity48 informers or spies became a key part of @entity3 activities			1
prior to 1972 , alleged informers had been killed and dumped by the roadside			2
after , their bodies were hidden in shallow graves , their families left to wonder about their fate			0
along with @entity2 , 15 people were ' disappeared ' during the @entity51 , among them 17 - year - old @entity197 , 22 - year - old @entity198 and 19 - year - old @entity199			2
in the run - up to the signing of the @entity202 in 1999 , the @entity3 admitted responsibility for the killings and pledged to help the victim 's families find their remains			2
although nine have been found , another seven are still lost , including @entity199			0
the ' disappeared ' whose remains are yet to be discovered include alleged informers @entity211 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity217 officer captain @entity216 and former monk @entity218			0
the family was split up , the children scattered into care homes around @entity222 while @entity2 's remains were left where they fell , the location known only to the men who murdered her			1
it was n't until 31 years after @entity2 was taken that her children were finally given the chance to grieve and bury their mother			1
in 2003 , her remains were discovered close to a beach by a local man , and @entity2 's nine surviving children came together again for her funeral			1
afterwards , her coffin was placed in the grave of her husband @entity238 , who had died early in 1972 from cancer			2
but although they , in a sense , have their mother back ; for the @entity245 , the pain of losing her and having their lives turned upside down will never go away			2
mr @entity7 says : ' i always wondered what was going through my mother 's head , coming down [ to the beach ] to her death			1
' i just ca n't get my head round how a human being can do this to another human being			0
when they killed our mother , they knew we were going to be orphans and we 'd have to find someone else to look after us			2
' they knew what they were doing and they knew what they were leaving behind			0
i just ca n't get my head round that			0
i have the same nightmares about her all the time			0
seeing them [ the @entity3 men ] coming in			2
' it never goes away and the hurt is always there too			0
' the @entity276 airs tonight at 10pm on @entity277			0

@entity7 was speaking in @entity14 documentary @entity12
his mother @entity2 was just 38 when she was murdered by the @entity3 in 1972
she was believed to be an informer and spy for the @entity48
her children say this is untrue and the allegations have never been proven
