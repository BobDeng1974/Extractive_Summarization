@entity1 's plans for next season 's @entity3 campaign have received a huge boost after it was confirmed the club will only need to name five rather than eight home - grown players in their reduced 21 - man squad			1
pressure from the players ' union @entity11 has forced @entity13 to agree to water down its sanctions imposed against @entity1 and @entity15 for breaching financial fair play rules			1
@entity13 had intended that both clubs would only be allowed to have 21 players with eight of those having come through the youth system in their home countries			0
champions : the @entity24 winners were penalised by @entity13 for breaching @entity25 restrictions : city only need five home - grown players in their squad so can have more foreign players ease : @entity13 's annoucement makes manager @entity34 's transfer plans some what easier now @entity13 's general secretary @entity36 has now confirmed that instead the clubs will only have to name five home - grown players , a decision which could have a significant impact on @entity1 's transfer plans			1
last season , @entity1 registered 23 players and used only 21 due to the eight home - grown players rule , so to have this reduced to five means the effect of the sanction on the club has been greatly diluted			2
@entity36 , in @entity50 for the @entity51 , told @entity52 : ' it came after a request from the players union @entity11 saying when you take these kind of sanctions and measures you can not harm the players and the rights of a player who has a contract for the behaviour of the clubs			0
' so we looked at it and it was felt appropriate there for the number to be proportionally reduced as well			0
' @entity1 and @entity15 were each fined £ 49million over three years , which could be reduced to a single year if financial targets are met in the following years			2
@entity1 said their summer transfer plans would be unaffected by a restriction limit of their transfer spending to a net £ 49million			0
positive : city have been boosted by the news they will only have to field five home - grown players home - grown : @entity82 ( left ) has been linked with a move away and @entity84 ( right ) has already left the clubs also have to cap their @entity3 squad wage bills at their 2013/4 levels for the next two seasons			1
the reduction in the home - grown players limit means @entity1 will be able to cope with the expected departure of @entity84 on a free transfer , with @entity93 and @entity82 also being linked with a move			2
keeper @entity95 , midfielder @entity96 , left - back @entity97 and defender @entity99 were also named as home - grown players in last season 's @entity3 squad .			0
