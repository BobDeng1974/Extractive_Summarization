labour leader @entity0 outlined his plan to bring in a mansion tax in his conference speech , but economists fear the £ 1.2billion haul from the measure would be wiped out by plunging stamp duty , inheritance tax and running costs @entity12 ’s £ 1.2billion - a - year mansion tax haul could be virtually wiped out by plunging stamp duty , inheritance tax and running costs , experts warned last night			1
many prospective buyers desperate to avoid a new annual one per cent tax on properties worth more than £ 2million would lower their offers , research suggests			1
meanwhile , sellers wary of trying to market homes burdened with the mansion tax would be more likely to price them lower			1
even a 10 per cent fall in the value of properties priced £ 2million or more would trigger a £ 500million slump in tax receipts for stamp duty and death duties , analysis by estate agent @entity31 shows			1
and when the annual cost of running a new valuation department is added to the money needed to pay owners ’ appeal bills , the anticipated £ 1.2billion gain could be lost			1
@entity38 , director of research at @entity31 , said : ‘ there would be significant problems with the implementation of a mansion tax – not least regarding property valuations			1
‘ the potential is there for big leakage in the system , particularly from lower levels of stamp duty and inheritance tax			1
’ @entity52 , managing director of @entity53 , said : ‘ the cost of running what is likely to be a new government department could be hundreds of millions of pounds			0
‘ add all this in to the likely fall in taxes , and the gains could easily be wiped out – the whole premise is unworkable			0
’ and @entity62 , senior research economist at the @entity63 , said : ‘ adding in a mansion tax of one per cent a year wo n’t be very attractive to a buyer or a seller			1
so prices could fall as people price in the impact of this annual cost every year			0
more than 100,000 households could end up paying a new average tax bill of £ 15,000 if the tax is introduced at one per cent of values above a £ 2million threshold as anticipated			1
in may , 238 homes worth more than £ 2million were sold , figures from the @entity87 show , up by 46 per cent compared to the year before			1
while @entity12 says the tax will target only wealthy owners , there are fears it will unfairly hit pensioners who bought homes decades ago which have rocketed in value			2
this could leave pensioners on limited incomes trapped and forced to take out loans to cover the tax			0
it has been suggested that elderly homeowners without the money to pay up front may be able to put off paying the tax until they die			0
but this would still leave their families faced with bills for tens of thousands of pounds			0
@entity108 , senior tax partner at accountant @entity110 , said : ‘ for people who ca n’t afford the costs up front , deferring a mansion tax bill like this is a hard way of making it easy for them to cope with it			2
’ @entity121 , who used to sit on the @entity123 's @entity122 , which sets interest rates , said she ' would n't do the mansion tax ' herself an estimated 250,000 people will also have to stump up hundreds of pounds to pay for a surveyor in order to work out if their property is worth more than £ 2million , estate agent @entity126 suggested			1
at today ’s prices , its figures indicate that 110,000 homes will be affected by the mansion tax – double its 2013 estimate			2
@entity137 , global head of research at @entity126 , said : ‘ the cost of these valuations for householders who are n’t sure if their home would fall within the bracket is going to be a real problem			0
it ’s yet another layer of charges on the property market			0
’ and yesterday a former @entity123 economist who authored a report on housing for the last @entity12 government criticised the mansion tax			2
@entity121 – who used to sit on the @entity122 , which sets interest rates , said : ‘ it ’s difficult to feel sorry about the effects of house prices as they have risen so rapidly			0
’ but she went on to say that the move would be ‘ very disruptive ’ , adding : ‘ i would n’t do the mansion tax myself			2
’ @entity0 ’s mansion tax would hit homeowners in the south east of @entity123 to help @entity12 deliver an @entity78 windfall for @entity165 , it has emerged			1
despite the fact that only 0.3 per cent of the properties paying the levy would be north of the border , the @entity165 government would get 10 per cent of the proceeds			0
last night @entity173 mp @entity172 said : ‘ just when most people recognise we need to restore financial and democratic balance across the @entity177 , @entity12 and the @entity178 have come up with a polarising tax that treats @entity123 like a cash cow			0
’ and @entity181 , a @entity12 candidate to stand for @entity183 mayor , said : ‘ over 90 per cent of the money raised from the proposed tax will be from @entity186			2
surely it is only fair that this should be spent in @entity183			0

@entity0 *believes* a mansion tax will bring in £ 1.2billion to the @entity191
@entity193 would apply to all homes valued at more than £ 2million
but economists fear all money raised will be wiped out straight away
plunging stamp duty and running costs will affect policy , experts warn
sellers may simply reduce asking price to less than £ 2million , says research
