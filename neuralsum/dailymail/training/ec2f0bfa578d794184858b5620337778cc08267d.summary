that ’s just what she was like			0

neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from the nerve cells			2
it usually starts in the child 's abdomen , developing in the adrenal glands , before spreading to other areas such as the bones , liver and skin			0
about 100 children in the @entity235 are affected every year - it is most common in children under the age of five			2
the cause of the cancer is unknown but it is not generally genetic			0
symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread , but early symptoms can include aches and pains and loss of appetite			0
the most common symptom once the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the abdomen as well as constipation and stomach pain			0
other possible symptoms include a lump in the neck , bone pain , numbness in the lower body , anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin			0
the outlook for patients is generally better if the child is younger and the cancer is slow growing			0
it can be treated with surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy but it often returns after treatment			0
she was buried in the prom dress she never got the chance to wear			0
as news of her death spread , friends and neighbours who still had no idea she was even ill were left shocked			0
her mother said : ‘ of course it did n’t make any sense to them and they were understandably very upset but once we explained why we had kept it a secret they respected @entity7 ’s wishes			1
’ two months later a teacher from her school hand delivered @entity7 ’s gsce results			2
@entity7 had scored ten grades ranging between a * and @entity42 @entity15 said : ‘ we went to the cemetery and told her how well she had done			1
we laughed and told her not to be cross that they were n’t all @entity299			0
’ the family later started fundraising to be able to offer other cancer stricken youngsters the chance to enjoy normality in the way @entity7 had			1
the @entity306 was formed and by march last year they had raised enough to buy a caravan at the @entity310 camp in @entity212 where families of children with cancer could spend valuable time			1
this year they will operate their first full season but high running costs mean they need a constant flow of donations			0
@entity15 said : ‘ these families need our help , they deserve a break in what is the most difficult time of their lives and it ’s a privilege to help			2
