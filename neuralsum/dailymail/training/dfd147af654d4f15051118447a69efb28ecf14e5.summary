when @entity1 was shot dead a year ago , the official line was that he had spent almost five years hiding in total isolation			2
after the @entity4 leader was at long last rooted out , @entity6 and @entity7 authorities insisted he had never once left the @entity9 compound stormed by @entity6 special forces			1
now , however , two men have revealed to @entity12 the remarkable story of the night they hosted the world 's most wanted man for dinner			2
guest of honour : two tribesmen have claimed they met @entity1 in summer 2010 when a convoy of 4x4s brought him to their village in northwest @entity7 in the dead of night in summer 2010 - a year before @entity1 was killed - a handful of tribesmen waited in the @entity26 region of north - west @entity7			1
weeks earlier , an unnamed ' important person ' had told them to expect the visit			0
their guest 's name was kept secret , the hosts were not told why he was coming , and only learned the timing of his arrival with just a few hours to go			0
at about 11pm , a convoy of 4x4s thundered into sight			1
one of the tribal elders told the @entity12 : ' a dozen big four - wheel drive vehicles drove into the compound			2
they seemed to converge from different directions			0
' one of the vehicles pulled up to the building 's veranda and , to the hosts ' astonishment , a tall man dressed in robes and a white turban climbed down from the back seat			0
they could scarcely believe the man before them was @entity1 , as the terrorist figurehead stood by the car shaking hands			0
the elder told how he kissed the guest 's hand and pressed it to his eyes , a customary show of respect , before two assistants led @entity1 away to the room the villagers had set up for him			0
unruly : @entity7 's tribal north - east , supposedly the site of the secret meeting , has been described as one of the most dangerous places on @entity72 so shrouded in secrecy was this meeting , it was not until the earth - shaking event of @entity1 's assassination that one of the hosts was shocked into revealing it had ever taken place			1
even with the @entity4 leader long dead , the two tribesmen who spoke out about the dinner did so only on condition of anonymity and the promise that the exact location of the meeting would not be revealed			1
nor would they identify the man who arranged it , or any of @entity1 's sizeable entourage			0
@entity1 spent three hours with the men , in a settlement about 180 miles from the @entity7 garrison town where he would meet his bloody fate			1
during that time , they said , the feared jihadi offered prayers , rested and ate a meal of lamb chops , chicken curry and rice			0
turbulent : @entity7 army soldiers take position in @entity26 , near the border with @entity107			1
@entity1 would have had to pass under the noses of such patrols to reach his supposed hosts security was strict throughout , with armed men guarding the compound 's gate , roof and along the walls - barring any of the hosts from leaving			2
the guards were wary when one of the hosts asked that his elderly father be allowed to meet the notorious @entity1 , pleading that it was the 85 - year - old 's dying wish			0
@entity1 said he would grant the old man 's wish , and four armed henchmen marched the son home to fetch his father - who was not told whom he was meeting until they were safely inside the compound			2
the two tribesmen recalled how they and their guests smiled knowningly as the old man spoke for 10 minutes , passing on tips on tribal warfare and lavishing praise on the infamous guest - none of which @entity1 understood , as it was spoken in the man 's native @entity137 language			0
when the time came for the @entity4 chief and his men to leave , they did so just as they had arrived , apparently scattering in several directions to leave no clue as to where @entity1 's car was headed			1
this mysterious event leaves much unexplained			0
@entity7 's tribal north west is a region of continuing unrest , and at the time the country 's forces would have been on high alert , with a gauntlet checkpoints set up to monitor traffic and crack down on militants			1
if the tribesmen 's tale is to be believed - and especially if other such visits come to light - it will surely cast doubt on the @entity7 authorities ' claims that they did all they could to bring @entity1 to justice .			1

two men claim they played host to the @entity4 leader after a huge convoy of 4x4s rolled into their village
@entity6 and @entity7 authorities insist he never left his compound in the years before @entity6 special forces hunted him down
