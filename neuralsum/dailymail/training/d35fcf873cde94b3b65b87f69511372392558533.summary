government study found people who go to the library are much happier than those who take part in fitness activities such as going to the gym fitness fanatics have long weighed up the relative benefits of whether they should bother to take out an expensive gym membership			1
now they do n’t need to bother - because a government study has been commissioned to find out if it is actually worth it			1
and the conclusions are that those who fork out regular sums to attend keep fit class are significantly unhappier than those who do n’t			2
a bizarre report , commissioned by ministers , ranks different leisure activities based on how much money they are worth to the people who take part in them			1
dancing and swimming , apparently , appear to have such a positive effect on well - being that they are worth a salary boost of more than £ 1,600 a year			2
going to the library is also beneficial - and was worth the equivalent of a £ 1,359 hike in pay			2
but fitness activities , such as going to the gym , are actually associated with people being unhappier than they would otherwise be			1
on top of the huge amount that people pay in gym membership , the study found that the level of unhappiness associated with keeping fit was worth a pay cut of £ 1,318			1
performing music is also associated with making people unhappy , according to the study - to the tune of £ 1,248 a year			1
the report was carried out by academics commissioned by the @entity49 , which until recently was headed by @entity51 who resigned over her expenses earlier this month			1
although the research - written by three academics - will have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds , it said it is not possible to prove a causal link between gym membership and unhappiness ; only that there is a correlation			0
last night campaigners asked why the @entity64 was spending so much on pointless pieces of research that do not even reach a conclusion			0
the report ranked different leisure activities based on how much money they are worth to the people who take part in them			1
going to the library was worth the equivalent of a £ 1,359 pay rise , according to the study @entity79 , of the @entity80 ’ @entity78 , said : ‘ it is absolutely staggering that ministers saw fit to spend taxpayers ’ money commissioning this ludicrous report			1
it beggars belief that anyone could think this a reasonable way to spend our hard - earned cash			1
‘ [ new culture secretary ] @entity93 needs to wage a war on waste inside his new department and cut out the spending on this kind of nonsense as a matter of urgency			0
’ participating in dance - £ 1,671 regular swimming - £ 1,630 visiting libraries - £ 1,359 taking part in team sports - £ 1,127 arts and crafts - £ 1,020 attending plays - £ 999 individual sports - £ 828 attending concerts - £ 742 source : @entity112 the @entity49 study , published late last week , is called @entity114 and valuing the @entity115			1
it follows the much - derided work of the @entity118 in measuring the well - being of the nation			0
. the academics who compiled the report looked at a survey of 40,000 people who were asked about their participation in arts and sport , as well as their level of ‘ subjective wellbeing ’ ( @entity131 )			1
using this data , and taking into account other information such as salary and age , they worked out which activities were associated with happiness , and which were not			0
under the scheme used , if an activity increases the @entity131 by one index point , and an increase in household income of £ 5,000 a year also increases @entity131 by one index point , the researchers concludes that the activity is worth £ 5,000 to them			0
the report concluded : ‘ we identify statistically significant associations between cultural and sport engagement and individual wellbeing , and a range of other social impacts			0
‘ arts engagement was found to be associated with higher wellbeing			2
this is valued at £ 1,084 per person per year , or £ 90 per person per month			0
‘ a significant association was also found between frequent library use and reported wellbeing			0
using libraries was valued at £ 1,359 per person per year for library users , or £ 113 per person per month			0
the study found that the level of unhappiness associated with keeping fit was worth a pay cut of £ 1,318 ( file picture ) ‘ sport participation was also found to be associated with higher wellbeing			1
this increase is valued at £ 1,127 per person per year , or £ 94 per person per month			0
’ in particular , dance is associated with the happiest people , and was worth £ 1,671 a year			2
swimming is next , with an effect worth £ 1,630			0
but it also concludes : ‘ the following activities are negatively and significantly associated with life satisfaction - fitness ( such as going to the gym ) and performing music			1
’ however , while the report is happy to say that engagement with the arts and libraries may be the cause of higher wellbeing , it rejects such a causal link when there is a negative association			2
‘ the negative relationship between life satisfaction and fitness and gym exercise might be due to people with lower life satisfaction in the first place “ selecting ” into gym exercise - in other words , that people who feel bad about themselves ( overweight , unfit etc ) may be more likely to go to the gym , ’ it said			2
‘ in this case we would be wrong to conclude that fitness and gym exercise are bad for life satisfaction			0
‘ a similar story could be said of the other negative relationship between playing music and life satisfaction - i.e. the sad musician			0
likewise , the positive relationships we see may be being driven to some extent by unobservable factors such as personality traits			0
’ last night a spokesman for the @entity49 , said : ‘ this research makes an interesting contribution to understanding the wide variety of social benefits , in education , health and wellbeing alongside the more established economic value of the arts and sport			2

study found fitness activities tend to be associated with unhappier people
