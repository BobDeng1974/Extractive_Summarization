@entity2 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity13 6.5 - not over tested by @entity0 and comfortable when required			1
could do nothing to stop @entity16 header on 36 minutes @entity17 6 - enthusiastic supporter of attacks down the right – not truly tested by @entity21 in defence			2
@entity23 looks impervious in midfield , producing another fine display for @entity0 @entity0 goalkeeper @entity26 made a string of fine saves against @entity2 @entity0 defender @entity16 rises highest to open the scoring at the @entity12 @entity30 5.5 - seemed slack when @entity0 opened the scoring			1
should have been tighter on @entity33 and allowed him to provide the all - important flick @entity35 6 - solid in defence but did n't marshall his troops as @entity0 stole through to score the opening goal			2
@entity40 6 - joined attack when necessary and contained @entity42 well enough			0
@entity0 's attacking midfielder @entity42 ( right ) takes on @entity2 right back @entity17 @entity46 6.5 - @entity47 as ever , intelligent in his passing but @entity0 closed him down quickly @entity49 6.5 - looked imperious at times in that midfield holding role , but was man closest to @entity16 as he opened the scoring			1
was n't having any of @entity56 's chat			0
@entity57 6.5 - was guilty of an awful ball when @entity2 had a first - half chance to break on @entity0			1

denied at the death by superb @entity26 save			0
@entity82 7 - @entity2 's danger man : lovely glancing header on 34 minutes which tested @entity26			2

@entity2 's @entity90 defender @entity30 closes down @entity56 as he looks to get forward @entity0 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity26 7.5 - superb save right at the death from @entity69 to keep tie in @entity0 's favour			1
no fault for goal and excellent save early on , notably from @entity82 @entity16 6 - towering header to score but @entity0 lost @entity57 on the right side for the equalising goal @entity0 playmaker @entity21 is fouled by @entity57 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) @entity33 5.5 - rare assist with a hopeful flick of the ball for the opening goal ; but missed header which allowed @entity82 to score @entity104 7 - organised , cajoled and generally was a strong presence , especially in the opening 30 minutes when @entity2 set out to attack @entity68 6.5 - @entity108 is his watchword			1

performed his given role – no frills , just did the job			0
@entity124 7 - as above but with a degree more authority and some intelligent passing @entity128 and tried but his game is n't made for these cautious away days @entity0 full back @entity68 fends off a challenge from @entity82 @entity42 breaks away from the challenges of @entity133 and @entity46 ( right ) @entity134 7 - excellent in both application of defensive work and his passing decisions @entity138 found space to threaten but team as mostly in counter attack mode @entity56 6 - did his duties but @entity143 was right ; he was n't at his best			2
willing to get involved with @entity49 despite having nothing to do with original argument @entity2 manager @entity146 looks incensed as he shouts instructions to his players from the touchline referee @entity151 ( @entity152 ) 6 - got the big calls right and generally stayed in control			0
did n't let either team intimidate managers @entity143 7 - @entity158 nights do n't catch him out			0
cautious early on and then the away goal provided an excellent foundation – but @entity0 curiously slack letting in equalsier @entity146 6 - his side did most of the attacking in the early stages of the game but could have been more ambitious			2
@entity0 were cautious until their opening goal			0
conceding that scuppered his best - laid plans @entity56 clahes with @entity49 during the round of 16 tie at the @entity12 @entity69 manages to get a shot away ahead of the oncoming @entity33			1
