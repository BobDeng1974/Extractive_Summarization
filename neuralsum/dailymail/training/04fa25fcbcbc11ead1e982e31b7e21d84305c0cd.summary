the extent of @entity3 ’ contract stand - off with @entity1 has placed all the @entity5 ’s top clubs on standby for a £ 25million summer scramble to sign him			1
@entity1 bosses are digging in their heels over @entity3 ’ bold bid to more than double his earnings from just over £ 60,000 a week to around £ 150,000 and have bluntly told him talks over a new deal will remain on hold until he lowers his sights			2
the 24 - year - old @entity16 midfielder was even relegated to the bench for the first time in two months on sunday , in a further escalation of his @entity21 woes that has alerted all the @entity5 big guns			1
video : scroll down to see @entity1 's recent brilliant performance against @entity25 toni the target : @entity5 clubs are very interested in @entity1 midfielder @entity3 ( right ) @entity28 revealed just over a week ago how @entity30 manager @entity29 had been first to react to growing uncertainty over @entity3 ’ future by watching @entity1 ’s game at @entity34 with the 24 - year old ’s agent			1
should there still be no thaw in relations at the end of the season , it seems certain @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and even @entity46 will declare their hand and make it clear to @entity3 they are prepared to meet his wage demands			1
in an intriguing sub-plot , there have even been claims in @entity16 that @entity45 missed out on prime target @entity53 because @entity1 have lined him up as @entity3 ’ replacement in the summer			1
former @entity57 and @entity58 striker @entity56 , who works as a tv pundit in @entity60 and @entity16 , tweeted : ‘ @entity1 managed to stop the @entity53 deal by saying “ we take him in the summer			2
” ’ sub standard ? @entity3 was dropped to the bench for @entity1 's match on sunday reacting badly : @entity3 was not happy at being taken off recently against @entity66 @entity56 ’s claim is as yet unsubstantiated , but what is beyond doubt is that @entity1 will not be dictated to over extending a contract that has less than 18 months to run			1
@entity3 is currently in the middle band of earners , whose pay ranges from £ 50,000 to £ 80,000 a week , but feels he should be elevated to the elite section , where the likes of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 pocket around £ 150,000			0
@entity1 are about to add @entity81 striker @entity80 to the top earners but are determined to maintain the balance of their pay scale on current lines and are adamant @entity86 can not move up			2
@entity1 buy ? @entity87 have reportedly lined up @entity88 's @entity53 ( centre ) to replace @entity3 their hardline stance has received influential backing from former @entity16 midfielder @entity92 , who reinforced the view that @entity3 will have to climb down or possibly consider a fresh start in the @entity5 next season			1
‘ i would advise @entity3 not to overplay his hand , ’ he said			0
‘ there are a few players who can not be replaced , but he is not one of them			0
he is playing a risky game at @entity1			0
the club are determined not to pay huge wages to all their players , in order to stay healthy financially			0
‘ this could become a situation where @entity3 forces @entity1 to set an example			0
he might be overrating himself a bit with his wage demands , in that they might not reflect his worth to the team			0
he would be wise to have a good look at the squad and rethink his situation			0
’ watching brief : @entity29 ( centre ) was at @entity34 vs @entity1 to see @entity3 first hand interested : @entity44 manager @entity117 ( top left ) , @entity46 boss @entity118 ( top left ) , @entity45 's @entity119 ( bottom left ) and @entity43 chief @entity121 are all monitoring @entity123 ' situation the prospects of a compromise with @entity1 have hardly been helped by signs of petulance on the pitch			1
@entity3 threw his gloves to the floor in anger after being substituted at @entity66 last week and promptly found himself demoted to the bench for sunday ’s crushing win over @entity25			2
it is being viewed as evidence that manager @entity137 , like his boardroom bosses , will take no nonsense from a player who has been an integral part of @entity1 ’s recent dominance but is now embroiled in a dangerous game of brinkmanship over his future .			0
