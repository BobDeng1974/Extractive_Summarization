by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 11 april 2013 a 21 - year - old student has found a way of allowing @entity4 users to encode pictures with secret messages			1
@entity7 , a computer science student at @entity8 , has created a browser extension that allows people to share secret messages on the social networking site			2
@entity13 allows anyone with access to @entity16 to hide 140 character long messages in @entity20 images uploaded to @entity4 and these messages can only be unlocked using a personal password			1
@entity13 allows anyone with access to @entity16 to hide 140 character long messages in jpeg images uploaded to @entity4 it works by hiding messages amongst the millions of images that are uploaded to @entity4			1
it does this by changing a pixel to a different colour and then replicating it in many different pictures to spell out a message			0
this message is then only revealed to someone who knows the password and knows which pixel to look for			0
according to @entity35 , mr @entity7 spent two months designing the programme as part of a university project			0
it is the first time that anyone has managed to work out how to hide messages in computer files and it is very difficult for @entity4 to detect as it operates through a @entity16 web extension platform			1
@entity13 works by hiding steganographic messages where no one would think to look – in this case , among the millions of images that are uploaded to @entity4			1
mr @entity7 told @entity35 : ‘ many tools for steganography in jpegs have existed in the past although they have always required that the images are transmitted exactly as they are			0
’ for example , this could be one pixel which has been changed to a different colour and then replicated in many pictures to spell out a message – to see this message you have to know the password and which pixel to look for			2
however , when a picture is uploaded to @entity4 the image is automatically formatted which would render any message incomprehensible			2
it is the first time that anyone has managed to work out how to hide messages in computer files and it is very difficult for @entity4 to detect as it operates through a @entity16 web extension platform as a result , mr @entity7 had to copy the sites recompression algorithm so that the encoded message is automatically compressed meaning that it does not change when recompressed by @entity4			1
mr @entity7 accepts that the technology could be used by terrorists but he believes that they would not use his method of steganography as it is not entirely secure			0
when @entity35 approached @entity4 a spokesperson declined to comment on @entity13 .			0

@entity82 *'s* *plugin* allows encoding of pictures with messages
it allows people to hide 140 character notes , which can only be unlocked using a password , in pictures that are uploaded to @entity4
first time anyone has worked out how to hide messages in computer files - it works by placing messages where people would *n't* think to look
there is a fear that the technology could be used by terrorists
