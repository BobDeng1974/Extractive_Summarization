and @entity22 , the @entity23 elected leader of his party during @entity7 ’s final years in power , also said he would prefer something ‘ more simple ’			0
dr @entity2 said the ceremonial event , costing up to £ 10million , was ‘ asking for trouble ’ amid divisions over the late prime minister ’s legacy			0
the @entity35 bishop added : ‘ i think that in a context where there is manifestly great ill - feeling about her tenure and about her legacy , to then actually have a situation where we seem to be expecting the nation to glorify that with a £ 10million funeral ... i think any sensible person would say that that is asking for trouble			2
‘ it plays into the hands of those more extreme people who will use the funeral as an opportunity to promote certain political views			1
i think it was probably a mistake			0
’ but @entity56 , @entity57 mp for @entity58 , said : ‘ he ’s completely wrong and it seems particularly bizarre that of all the people to take this view , it ’s the @entity3			1

mr @entity17 called for a debate to be held over the appropriate arrangements for when a prime minister dies , and said : ‘ i ’m a @entity106 , i would , by inclination , err towards something rather more simple than what we will see , but my sense is this is not the week to be having those discussions			0
