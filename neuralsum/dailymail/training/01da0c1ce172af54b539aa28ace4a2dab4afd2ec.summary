college @entity12 teacher @entity11 , of @entity14 , was out for an early morning surf at his regular spot in @entity17 , @entity18 - a known shark ground where a friend of his , @entity20 , almost died last year			1
@entity11 had been in the water about two hours , with friends and other surfers around , when something just hit him			1
so lucky : unlike many , @entity11 , a keen surfer and @entity13 teacher , encountered a @entity5 and lived to tell the tale petrifying : great whites are considered one of ( if not the ) deadliest creature in the ocean			1
they have been seen before in the spot @entity11 was surfing near the @entity14 town of @entity18 where he lives recovery : this photo - taken by @entity34 , @entity11 's wife , the day after the attack - shows @entity34 in @entity18 's @entity37 after having 30 stitches in his thigh following a shark attack ' sometimes you have a feeling that the water is weird , ' @entity11 said on monday from his hospital bed at @entity18 's @entity37			1
' but everyone was just so happy			0
i was lying on my board , paddling around just waiting for a wave set			0
' moments later @entity11 realized every surfers worst fears - the sight of a shark 's teeth and nose suddenly came ' out of nowhere '			1
not yet aware of what had happened , @entity11 took a swing at the great white , which he estimated was 8 - to - 9 feet long , and let what a friend who was nearby a ' primordial yell ' ( a primal scream )			1
' i could n't believe it happened , ' @entity11 said			1
' when i turned away from the shark , i said , '' did i really get bit ? '' your mind does n't believe it			2
' @entity11 said he did a quick inventory of his body parts and found everything was intact			1
however he had been bitten on the thigh			0
family photo : @entity11 with his wife @entity73 and their son august ( left ) and daughter @entity76 ( right ) close call : @entity11 is lucky to be alive after being attacked by a shark in @entity14			1
here , he is pictured with his wife @entity73 , daughter @entity76 and son august @entity11 teaches son august how to play golf			1
@entity11 has survived a shark attack while surfing a spot called @entity86 a friend encouraged him to keep paddling toward the beach			1
once there , friends and fellow surfers applied pressure on the wound and tied a t - shirt to stop the bleeding			0
' what 's strange about it was how amazing the morning was , how everyone was having a good time , and then the dichotomy , ' @entity11 said			1
@entity11 was alert and conscious on shore when rescue crews got to the scene around 8:45 a.m , @entity102 chief @entity101 said			1
@entity11 said the bite wound on his left thigh did not sever an artery or damage any tendons			2
there was some muscle tissue damage that required about 30 stitches , but he was expected to fully recover			0
he said he thinks he was spared from more damage by his old surf board , which is thicker than many modern boards			2
" if you 're going to get bitten by a shark , i had the best scenario , " he said			2
@entity11 said he will ' definitely surf again '			1
but ominously , he admitted to already having had a dream in which something was tugging on his surfboard leash			0
' there 's just a power in the ocean , ' @entity11 said			2
' when you see a shark or get bitten by a shark , you 're just made critically aware of that power			0
' it 's not the first time a surfer has been made critically aware of a shark in the same spot			2
@entity20 , a surfer pal of @entity134 , was pulled underwater by a great white at @entity86 in november last year			1
doctors say @entity20 suffered at least seven deep lacerations , but none of his vital organs was damaged			0
' @entity144 , from behind me and out of the corner of my left eye something dark broke the surface and i felt a weight land on my back , ' @entity20 wrote in an editorial about the attack for @entity150			0
' my first thought was it was a large seal , but as i was being drug underwater , feeling the force and power of being shaken in the jaws of a top predator , i began fearing for my life			0
i felt so small and insignificant , but i opened my eyes underwater and came face to face with the first shark i ’d seen in 13 years of surfing			0
' ' my right fist made contact with the shark just behind this eye			0
it felt like punching a bag of concrete			0
i ca n’t describe what i was feeling at this moment — some eerie combination of shock and terror			0
and then as quickly as the attack had started , it was all over			0
i was released , and the shark was gone into the depths			0
