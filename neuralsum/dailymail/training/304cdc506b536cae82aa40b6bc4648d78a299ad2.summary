' problem ' : former director of @entity4 @entity3 was aware of a ' deep liberal bias ' in the way @entity7 approached the topic of immigration , the report said the @entity4 ’s ‘ deep liberal bias ’ prevented it from reporting immigration properly , its former news chief has admitted			1
@entity3 told a @entity4 review into the impartiality of its own coverage that it failed to take anti-immigration lobby groups ‘ seriously ’ when she took the job in 2004 , the year @entity15 threw open its doors to migrants from @entity24			1
the report , published yesterday , collected a series of damning comments by current and former corporation employees who accused it of ‘ collective blindness ’ and ‘ fundamental niceness ’ over controversial topics such as race and immigration			2
but it concluded that the @entity4 produces an ‘ impressive range of opinion ’ overall			2
critics said the report would encourage the @entity4 to continue to ignore concerns over bias			1
@entity45 mp @entity44 , who sits on the culture , media and sport committee , said : ‘ [ @entity3 ’s comments ] confirm what most of us have known for many years			0
' i do n’t want the @entity4 just to accept this and continue on their way			2
' what are they going to do to stop their liberal left - wing culture ? ’ sir @entity55 , chairman of lobby group @entity56 , said the review was a ‘ lost opportunity ’ and ‘ skated over ’ recent cases of corporation bias			1
the 65 - page report , produced by former @entity63 boss @entity62 , a self - confessed ‘ liberal progressive ’ , was called a ‘ whitewash ’ by @entity66 , the author of another recent investigation into @entity4 impartiality			1
' bias ' : the @entity4 was ' slow ' to catch up with public opinion on topic including immigration and the @entity15 's membership of the @entity74 , according to a new report former @entity4 chief aware of ' deep liberal bias ' in its approach to topic of immigration mr @entity62 ’s review , which cost licence fee - payers £ 175,000 , criticised the @entity4 for being ‘ slow to reflect the weight of concern in the wider community ’ about immigration and the @entity74			1
he said the corporation gave too much prominence to the opinions of politicians , who were hesitant to discuss immigration issues			0
but he concluded the overall selection of opinion broadcast by the @entity4 is ‘ broad and impressive ’ , adding : ‘ only the very unreasonable would argue that the @entity4 is not providing a suitable breadth of views and opinion on the subject of @entity24			2
’ as part of his eight - month analysis , mr @entity62 interviewed 25 senior @entity4 staff , including @entity101 , now director of @entity102			1
public opinion : the independent review , commissioned by the @entity105 , said the corporation was slow to reflect the weight of concern in the wider community surrounding immigration debate : the @entity4 was ' slow to give appropriate prominence ' to the growing weight of opinion opposing @entity15 membership of the @entity74 , the report said he said : ‘ [ @entity101 ] accepts that when she came into her role in september 2004 there had been a problem in the @entity4 ’s coverage of immigration			1
she was aware , she told us , of a “ deep liberal bias ” in the way that the @entity4 approached the topic , and specifically that press releases coming from @entity56 were not always taken as seriously as they might have been			1
’ @entity4 presenter @entity126 accused the corporation of a ‘ general corporate sensitivity ’ and a ‘ collective blindness ’ over race and immigration			1
former today programme journalist @entity137 added : ‘ what damages the @entity4 on a subject like immigration is fundamental niceness and being loath to give offence to any part of the community			2
‘ it is a self - censoring idea : “ let ’s not encourage debate as it might encourage nasty elements in society			0
” it is entirely wrong - headed			0
’ however , mr @entity62 refused to express an opinion on whether the @entity4 was guilty of liberal bias			1
he added : ‘ there is no genuine argument that the presence of one type of programming is squeezing out the opportunity to hear an alternative point of view			0
’ he even suggested viewers and listeners should ‘ read a book ’ if they were unhappy with the @entity4			0
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ we are pleased our coverage has been deemed “ remarkable ” and “ impressive ”			2
’ a well - known figure in @entity163 media circles , 62 - year - old @entity62 was @entity63 ’s chief executive until 2002 when he resigned after the collapse of @entity165 set up the independent programme maker @entity167 and his many @entity4 credits include @entity171 series @entity169 and , in 2007 , a three - part series based on the diaries of former @entity175 spin doctor @entity174			1
he began his career as a @entity4 graduate trainee journalist and last year he revealed : ‘ i have a long - term affection for the @entity4			0
it ’s important for all of us in broadcasting			0
’ yesterday mr @entity62 , who now heads @entity182 , insisted he is not currently working on any @entity4 projects			1
defending his appointment , @entity105 member @entity184 said : ‘ @entity62 has been very open about his [ liberal ] perspective			2
he was a very good person to do this report			0
’ the review of @entity4 current affairs likened @entity193 host @entity192 to a brutal boxer			0
it highlighted an episode of @entity193 where @entity192 clashed with respect mp @entity197			0
author @entity62 said : ‘ when @entity197 squared up to @entity192 after @entity197 won the @entity198 by - election , @entity192 started raining blows on him from the starting bell , to an extent that i was surprised to find my sympathies going towards the challenger			0
’ he also said that interviews on @entity208 ’s today , for example by @entity206 , could be like a fairground prize - fighter taking on an amateur			0
‘ the result can be excruciatingly entertaining to witness , and no one doubts that both sides need properly to be tested , but it is not always a fair display of the merits of each fighter , ’ he said .			0
