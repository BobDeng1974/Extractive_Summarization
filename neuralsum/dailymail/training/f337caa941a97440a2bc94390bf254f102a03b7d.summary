by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 chairman @entity2 has promised he will announce his 2015 driver line - up before the end of the season			1
current drivers @entity8 and @entity9 are in limbo as @entity2 assesses the market to see who might be available			1
although linked with @entity14 and @entity15 , both men are under contract to @entity17 and @entity18 respectively , and @entity2 has previously stated he is a man who respects agreements			2
on track : but @entity8 is facing a fight to save his @entity3 seat with @entity2 assessing his options one situation he is keeping an eye on is that at @entity28 as former driver @entity26 and team - mate @entity27 go head to head			1
with @entity28 motorsport boss @entity32 also suggesting one or others could be out of a job if they cross the line in future , in the wake of their collision at @entity39 , that has placed @entity2 on alert			2
@entity3 are ready to offer him an escape route			2
they and @entity44 , their engine partners of next season , want a marquee signing to end a period of decline at the team			1
@entity8 , who is 34 and thought by the @entity3 hierarchy to be small fractions short of fast enough , could well make way			1
@entity2 ( centre ) is courting a reunion with former @entity3 driver @entity26 , who left the team in 2012 for now , @entity2 maintains he does not know who will be behind the wheel in 2015 , but insists an answer will be delivered come the conclusion to the season in @entity59 in late november			1
' we always have the best available drivers , ' said @entity2			0
' without being derogatory , detrimental or negative to your existing drivers , the first thing you have to establish , before you have any process of selection , is who is available			0
' no - one could have predicted the tension inside @entity69 , or imagine a range of scenarios that could see one of those drivers on the market by the end of the year			0
' that does not mean we would automatically reach for that driver , or any other driver , in preference to what we have			0
rookie : @entity9 has impressed on his debut year with @entity3 but his seat for 2015 is not yet safe ' what it means is you are trying to understand who is available , and then you make a decision			1
it could be that decision is not to change			0
' that 's because stability , as we go into the relationship with @entity44 ( power unit supplier from 2015 ) , has huge value , and loyalty is very important to me too			1
' so as for a decision , it certainly wo n't be in the next few days , and it wo n't be at the end of the season , it will be something in between			0
' @entity2 insists @entity8 and @entity9 are in the loop as to his plans , adding : ' i am a huge fan of both @entity9 and @entity105 has done an amazing job			1
' we are delighted with our drivers , and i have apologised to @entity8 for the distracting elements of where we are at the moment			0
' but we 've always tried to understand driver availability , and at this moment there is no decision to take			0
' all i 'm doing is making @entity9 and @entity8 completely aware the best thing they can do is their best job and not get distracted by the whole thing			2
there is nothing to be distracted by			0
' @entity2 has confirmed , though , @entity44 are involved in the selection process			2
it has long been understood @entity44 are driving @entity3 to recruit an a-list name for their return to @entity126 after what will be a seven - year absence			1
' we would not , for one minute , not involve them in the decision , but the decision is ours , ' said @entity2 .			0

@entity26 could make *sensational* return to @entity136 team
@entity3 keen to mark return of engine supplier @entity44 with marquee signing
@entity8 and @entity9 in *danger* of being *replaced*
but @entity2 adds he is a ' huge fan ' of the @entity144 and his rookie team - mate
