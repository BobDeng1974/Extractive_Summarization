sex change approved : @entity1 , now known as @entity2 , sits in @entity3 in 1993 in @entity4 , @entity5 , where @entity2 was on trial for the may 1990 murder of his wife a federal appeals court on friday upheld a judge 's ruling granting a taxpayer - funded sex change operation for a transgender inmate serving a life sentence for a murder conviction , saying receiving medically necessary treatment is a constitutional right that must be protected ' even if that treatment strikes some as odd or unorthodox			1
' @entity21 district judge @entity20 ruled in 2012 that the state department of correction must provide sex reassignment surgery for @entity2 , who was born @entity2 and is serving a life sentence for the killing of his wife in 1990			2
the @entity22 challenged the ruling , arguing @entity2 has received adequate treatment for gender identity disorder , including female hormones , laser hair removal and psychotherapy			1
prison officials said those treatments have eased the stress and anxiety felt by the 64 - year - old @entity2 , and they brought in experts who supported their argument that it was unnecessary to heed advice from independent medical experts who recommended she undergo the sex change surgery as the next step in treating her gender identity disorder			1
the @entity22 also argued it was concerned about protecting @entity2 , who 's in an all - male prison , from sexual assaults if she were allowed to complete her transformation into a woman			1
but judges cited a prison security review conducted after @entity2 lived safely as a woman with male prisoners , wearing women 's clothing , using women 's cosmetics and taking hormones that caused her to develop breasts			1
they said no security issues cropped up			0
as @entity2 : @entity59 is led out of the @entity62 , @entity61 courthouse on may 24 , 1990 @entity21 1st @entity65 judges @entity63 and @entity66 said in their ruling that courts must not shrink from their obligation to enforce the constitutional rights of all people , including prisoners			2
' and receiving medically necessary treatment is one of those rights , even if that treatment strikes some as odd or unorthodox , ' they wrote			0
one member of the three - judge appeals panel , judge @entity79 , disagreed , saying in a separate opinion the ruling went beyond the boundaries of protections offered under the @entity84			0
still , @entity2 's lawyer @entity85 said they were very happy her right to receive the treatment was affirmed			2
' this decision is really about more than sexual reassignment surgery , ' @entity85 said			0
' it 's about the state 's requirement to treat all prisoners equally regardless of their gender identity or regardless of the circumstances			1
' @entity2 was convicted of killing @entity97 , a volunteer counselor at a drug rehabilitation facility who thought she could cure his gender identity disorder			1
@entity101 shot : @entity59 's original may 1990 file booking photo provided by the @entity62 @entity103 @entity2 first sued the @entity22 in 2000			1
two years later , the @entity21 district court judge found @entity2 was entitled to treatment for gender identity disorder but stopped short of ordering surgery			1
@entity2 sued again in 2005 , arguing the surgery was a medical necessity			0
@entity2 's attorney @entity110 had previously said the surgery , which can cost more than $ 50,000 , would be paid for under a contract the @entity22 has with its medical provider			2
she said the contract is based on the number of inmates , not the number of medical procedures provided , so the surgery would n't increase the state 's costs			0
@entity124 gov. @entity123 had no immediate comment on the appeals court ruling or whether a further appeal to the @entity21 @entity128 was possible , a spokeswoman said			0
the @entity22 was reviewing the court decision			0
@entity131 - based legal group @entity130 said that in a civilized society there 's ' a baseline of care that has to be provided to all prisoners , including prisoners who are transgender			0
' ' we hope that @entity2 will now get the treatment that she desperately needs , ' said @entity141 , director of @entity130 's @entity142 .			0

the ruling paves the way for @entity59 's transformation to @entity2 to be funded with taxpayer *dollars*
the sex change surgery is seen as the best way to treat @entity59 's gender identity disorder
the convicted murder has been living among male inmates as a woman - even wearing makeup and with hormone - induced breasts
