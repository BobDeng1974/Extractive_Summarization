scientists have found a new way to ' switch off ' pain , and it could lead to the development of non-addictive drugs for millions of patients suffering chronic discomfort			1
researchers managed to block a pain pathway in rodents with chronic neuropathic pain , which develops due to nerve damage			1
they did this by switching on a receptor , known as @entity14 , in a rat 's brain and spinal cord to counteract intense feelings of discomfort			1
scientists have found a new way to stop pain , which could one day alleviate suffering for people who suffer intense pain caused by bone cancer and chemotherapy , for example ( stock image ) current treatments for pain are problematic because they cause intolerable side effects , diminish quality of life and do not sufficiently quell pain , the scientists say			1
but their new method could avoid nasty side effects from current pain relief drugs , such as addiction or increasing tolerance , meaning that people need to take higher and stronger doses of medication			1
the new method could avoid nasty side effects from current pain relief drugs ( illustrated with a stock image ) , such as addiction or tolerance , meaning that people need to take higher doses earlier this week scientists announced that they have created ‘ pain in a dish ’ by converting skin cells into sensitive neurons in a bid to learn more about these sensations			2
the lab - created nerve cells respond to a range of different kinds of pain stimulation , including physical injury , chronic inflammation and cancer chemotherapy			2
and in the future , the custom - made neurons could be used to investigate the origins of pain and develop better pain - relieving drugs			0
the work follows years of unsuccessful attempts to produce nerve cells from embryonic stem cells , which are immature ‘ blank slate ’ cells with the potential to become any tissue in the body			0
a turning point came with the development of technology that allowed ordinary skin cells to be reprogrammed into ‘ induced ’ stem cells			0
the scientists dubbed the complex process ' transcription - mediated lineage conversion of fibroblasts			0
' scientists at @entity85 in @entity86 , discovered that activating the @entity14 receptor in rodents – using a native chemical stimulator called adenosine , or synthetic drugs - prevents or reverses pain caused by nerve damage without side effects			1
their study is published in the medical journal , brain			0
@entity98 , professor of pharmacological and physiological sciences at the university , demonstrated the ability of the @entity14 adenosine receptor to mediate pain relieving effects of the chemical adenosine			2
‘ it has long been appreciated that harnessing the potent pain - killing effects of adenosine could provide a breakthrough step towards an effective treatment for chronic pain , ’ she said			2
‘ our findings suggest that this goal may be achieved by focusing future work on the @entity118 pathway , in particular , as its activation provides robust pain reduction across several types of pain			0
’ the chemical is already being investigated by experts as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent .			0

technique could one day be used to alleviate suffering of cancer patients
it would be better than current medication because it does *n't* have side effects like addiction and increasing tolerance to drugs
