' @entity0 ' may have triggered the world 's interest into the largest penguin species , but little was actually known about the fluctuating numbers of the emperor penguin , until now			1
the very first study into how the @entity8 's climate has affected the birds over the past 30,000 years has been conducted by a team of researchers , including some from the @entity12 and the @entity13			2
it was found that at some point , the @entity8 was too cold for these birds			0
temperatures were at least 15 degrees colder on average than they are today and just three colonies of the penguin survived that period			0
lead researcher @entity35 said that despite emperor penguins being accustomed to temperatures of minus @entity39 , the last @entity36 seems to have been a snap too cold for them			0
the study shows how the climate has affected the birds over the past 30,000 years , finding that @entity8 was once too cold for them the warming has made it easier for the emperor penguins to feed as the sea ice has melted and lessened the distance to the ocean ' due to there being about twice as much sea ice compared to current conditions , the penguins were unable to breed in more than a few locations around @entity8 , ' ms @entity35 said			1
' the distances from the open ocean , where the penguins feed , to the stable sea ice where they breed was probably too far			0
' the findings have suggested that the current sea ice conditions might be optimal for the emperor penguin population			1
with the species flourishing , the study has shown that their numbers began to increase over the last 12,000 years when temperatures rose and the sea ice began to decline			2
this warming would have made it easier for the penguins to access the ocean to feed			0
researchers are currently unable to determine the future of the largest and heaviest penguin species as they are clearly very sensitive to climate change and the current ideal conditions for these birds may not last .			1

the first study into the fluctuating numbers of the emperor penguin species has been conducted by **scientists**
during the last ice age , colonies were seven times smaller as opposed to the 50 thriving colonies now
the warming of the @entity8 has *allowed* them to flourish as the sea ice has *reduced* and they can access the ocean
**scientists** have warned they are sensitive to climate change and this growth in numbers may not last
