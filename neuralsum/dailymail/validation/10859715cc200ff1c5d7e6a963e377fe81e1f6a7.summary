he has already made abolishing the @entity1 the centerpiece of his young presidential campaign , and once spoke for 21 hours straight on the floor of the @entity5 in a bid to block its funding			1
but now @entity8 says he and his family will be the latest to use the system , signing up for medical insurance coverage through the @entity1 law 's government - run marketplaces			1
@entity8 's wife @entity14 has taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job at @entity18 to campaign with him – and lost her employer - funded plan in the process			1
as @entity21 gleefully mocked the irony , though , @entity8 insists he 's just following the law			1
@entity24 : @entity8 announced his presidential run on monday , the same day his wife took a leave of absence from her job – forgoing the family 's medical insurance @entity32 : the @entity8 daughters , @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) need a health plan and for now the @entity1 system will have to do – while their father works to ' rip it out , root and branch ' transition : @entity43 left her @entity18 ' @entity44 ' behind when she took a leave of absence to campaign for her husband ' we will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we 're in the process of transitioning over to do that , ' @entity8 , a @entity47 senator from @entity48 , told the @entity54 on tuesday			1
the exchanges , created by the @entity1 law , are designed to be state - specific insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can find coverage			1
using them is mandatory for middle - income americans who want to receive federal government subsidies to help pay their premiums			0
the @entity1 originally left members of @entity67 alone , but @entity69 @entity68 senator @entity68 famously inserted a ' poison pill ' amendment requiring them – and their staff members – to participate like other @entity73 if they lacked insurance from other sources			1
' the more that @entity67 experiences the laws it passes , the better , ' @entity68 said back then			2
@entity21 did n't budge , and the provision now requires @entity8 to join millions who have signed up for @entity1 - brokered coverage			1
he could get the last laught , however , using his experience to construct a first - hand testimonial about the law 's shortcomings			2
@entity86 lawmakers were mum tuesday on the development , passing up an easy opportunity to call @entity8 a hypocrite			0
@entity90 asked five @entity5 offices and five @entity93 offices , all @entity94 , for comment			0
@entity97 , @entity73 's biggest abortion lobby , did use the ' h ' word			0
it has defended the @entity1 law , largely because it forces insurers to provide contraception coverage			1
' luckily for sen. @entity8 , hypocrisy is n't a pre-existing condition , ' the group tweeted			0
the @entity105 weighed in , but offered only a half - swing at the softball question			0
' the @entity1 , by design , helps @entity73 who have gaps in employment get coverage , and it 's working , ' @entity105 national press secretary @entity108 told @entity90			2
' we encourage others to follow presidential candidate @entity8 to www.healthcare.gov and get covered			1
' the @entity115 firebrand wo n't exactly get a grassroots experience when he enrolls , however			0
@entity117 : the @entity105 piled on , but never called @entity8 a hypocrite the ' h ' word : abortion lobby @entity97 heaped on the scorn at @entity8 's predicament the @entity122 city government extends congressional offices a sweetheart deal that 's not part of the @entity1 itself , allowing federal lawmakers and their aides to enroll through the city 's @entity128			1
that system was designed for ' small businesses ' with fewer than 50 employees			0
the @entity67 employs more than 20,000 people			0
it also makes medical insurance customers eligible for payments from their employers for most of the premiums			2
the @entity140 administration 's @entity138 made the arrangement legal by quietly issuing a rule just before the @entity1 law took effect – and setting the typical reimbursement level at 75 per cent			2
some customers , including well - paid senators , will get that benefit even though their income levels would be too high to qualify for subsidies if they had to buy coverage on the open exchanges like millions of others			2
@entity8 told @entity154 on tuesday that he has no choice but to ' follow the text of every law , even laws i disagree with			2
' ' it 's one of the real differences – if you look at president @entity140 and the lawlessness , if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change , ' @entity8 said			1
not too late , @entity167 : even though the @entity1 open - enrollment period is over , @entity73 can still sign up if they ' have certain life changes in 2015 ' he also took a verbal swing at @entity173 @entity172 , who has allowed professional staffers on @entity5 committees to exempt themselves			0
' @entity172 and the @entity21 did n't want to be under the same rules as the @entity73 people , ' he sniped			0
but @entity8 still believes the @entity1 law should be killed – ' ripped out , root and branch ' is how he put it during an @entity69 event in january			1
' and i believe it will be , ' he told the paper , the largest and most influential in the early presidential caucus state of @entity69			0
' i believe in 2017 a new president , a @entity47 president will sign legislation repealing every word of it , ' he insisted			0
' there are a fair number of @entity47 in @entity122 and elsewhere who have quietly and privatively given up on that fight and i have not			0

presidential candidate *launched* campaign monday on the promise of replacing the @entity1 with something more @entity47 - *friendly*
but since his wife left her job to campaign with him , she lost the family 's medical insurance coverage – forcing them onto the @entity1 exchanges
law forces members of @entity67 who need coverage to buy it through government - run marketplaces
@entity21 poked fun at the irony but @entity8 insists he has to follow the laws @entity67 passes – even those he wants to see repealed
