mistreated : @entity1 care home worker @entity0 , picured arriving at @entity2 , was jailed for 18 months a nurse secretly filmed attacking an elderly @entity5 ’s sufferer in her care home bed was jailed yesterday			1
@entity0 , 30 , was caught when @entity7 suspected her mother @entity8 , 80 , was being mistreated and hid a camera in her bedroom			1
in the harrowing images , @entity0 is seen to suddenly strike the retired school canteen manager in the face before slapping her arms repeatedly			1
the @entity1 , who has an 18 month - old daughter , then finishes the attack by hitting mrs @entity7 in her abdomen four times			1
sentencing @entity0 to 18 months in jail , judge @entity19 told the nurse he was guilty of a ‘ dreadful breach of trust ’			1
‘ it is distressing for anybody to have to watch what ’s contained on the footage , ’ he said at @entity2 , central @entity23			2
‘ this poor woman had been transferred to this institution in the hope that she should receive proper care and attention			2
‘ quite rightly , society in general is extremely concerned about the treatment of the elderly and vulnerable in institutions such as this			0
' they should be able to expect better , and i am afraid those who are caught misusing their responsibility should be held to account			2
’ the assaults took place at the @entity45 care home in @entity47 , @entity23 on june 21 last year			0
mrs @entity7 , who was diagnosed with @entity5 ’s in 2008 , had been living at the home since july 2010			0
she has since been moved to another care home			0
after being told of the film ’s existence , @entity0 , who has no previous convictions , burst into tears and apologised			1
@entity2 heard that the footage of @entity0 hitting ms @entity7 was ' distressing ' for anyone who had to watch it @entity59 , prosecuting , said it was clearly evident that the home ’s own rules were frequently breached by its care staff			1
caught : mr @entity0 was caught when @entity65 's daugher @entity64 ( pictured ) suspected she was being neglected and installed a secret camera in her room ‘ two care workers must be present when a resident is put to bed , and bathing and cleaning should be carried out by a female care worker , ’ she said			1
‘ again , that was not adhered to			0
this is not a complaint lodged at mr @entity0 ’s feet – it was a problem that was clearly evident at the care home itself			1
’ despite this , it emerged that the care home had been given an excellent rating by regulators in 2009			0
speaking outside court , @entity7 said : ‘ nobody as vulnerable as my mother should ever have to suffer or endure the unprovoked attack and mistreatment she has experienced at the hands of her supposed carers			0
‘ had it not been for my actions , this abuse may never have been exposed , as i do not believe the existing safeguarding measures provide adequate protection			0
‘ the emotional impact this experience has had on me has been completely devastating			0
if this happened to my mother and was only discovered because of a hidden camera , what else is happening to other elderly people in care ? ‘ i believe the current care system for these people needs a complete review ; we need robust strategies put in place to put an end to this suffering			2
’ a spokesman for @entity45 said staff had been shocked by the case , adding : ‘ we are pleased justice has been done			0
’ @entity0 , of @entity114 , @entity23 , admitted common assault and ill treatment of a vulnerable person .			2
