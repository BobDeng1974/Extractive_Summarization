neanderthals may have invented specialised bone tools and passed their know - how on to the ancestors of modern humans			2
the discovery adds to growing evidence that the @entity2 , ( a model is pictured ) once viewed as dim - witted and primitive , had a high level of technological ability made from deer ribs , they are similar to the bone lissoirs or smoothers , still used by leather workers			1
the implements have a polished tip that , when pushed against a hide , creates softer and more water resistant leather			0
the excavated tools are similar to others found at sites occupied by early modern humans at a later stage , who replaced neanderthals in @entity39 around 40,000 years ago			0
' if @entity2 developed this type of bone tool on their own , it is possible that modern humans then acquired this technology from @entity2 , ' said dr @entity44 , one of the researchers from @entity46 in the @entity47			2
' modern humans seem to have entered @entity39 with pointed bone tools only , and soon after started to make lissoirs			0
made from deer ribs , the tools are similar to the bone smoothers , still used by leather workers			1
the excavated tools are also similar to others found at sites occupied by early modern humans ( illustrated ) at a later stage , who replaced neanderthals in @entity39 around 40,000 years ago ' this is the first possible evidence for transmission from @entity2 to our direct ancestors			1
' another possibility is that early modern humans started influencing @entity2 behaviour earlier than has been thought , said the scientists writing in the journal @entity64			0
neanderthals were genetically different from early modern humans but may have been closely enough related to interbreed			0
they were eventually driven to extinction because they could not compete with the superior technology and social organisation of our direct ancestors , experts believe .			0

@entity47 scientists found the 50,000 - year - old tools in south - west @entity15
the instruments made from deer ribs are similar to the bone lissoirs or smoothers , still used by leather workers
the tools are the first possible evidence for transmission from @entity2 to our direct ancestors
