by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:04 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 04:41 est , 13 march 2013 supermarkets have sparked a forecourt price - war by slashing up to 4p a litre at the pumps			1
motoring groups welcomed the cuts - worth up to £ 2 per fill - up - but said that the supermarkets had been until now trailing rivals who 'd already started undercutting them over the past fortnight ago			2
the price - cut moves by @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 also came as campaigners urge the chancellor ahead of next week 's budget to abandon a planned 3p a litre hike planned for september - or even announce a cut			1
price battle : @entity11 's has cut the cost of fuel from today , with @entity12 and @entity13 following suit @entity11 's sparked the price war by announcing that from today petrol prices at the company 's 279 forecourts will dip by 4p a litre , with diesel being reduced by 3p a litre			1
@entity12 then responded by announcing it would be cutting its petrol by up to 3p a litre and its diesel by up to 2p a litre , adding that drivers would pay no more than 134.7p a litre for petrol and 141.7p a litre for diesel			1
and @entity13 then jumped in with a 3p drop at its 496 forecourts			2
latest petrol price figures show the cost of filling up is continuing to put the squeeze on motorists , going up by another 5p a litre in february alone			2
this increase added £ 2.50 to the cost of a typical 50 - litre refill , or £ 3.50 to fill up a @entity49			1
a family with two petrol cars is now spending £ 10.62 a month more on fuel than at the beginning of the year			2
average @entity55 petrol prices stand at around 137,08p a litre , following a surge that started in the second week of january when the price was 132.01p			2
since the start of 2013 , diesel pump prices have increased from around 140p a litre to 143.96p			0
the @entity62 welcomed the move			0
@entity62 head of public affairs @entity64 said : ' this is a substantial fall , worth £ 2 a tank of petrol , and fairly reflects the drop in wholesale costs which started in late february			0
' however , many non-supermarket fuel stations started undercutting supermarket prices a fortnight ago			0
' he said : ' drivers will very much welcome @entity11 's move which gives respite after the third 8p - or - more pump price surge in the past 12 months			1
' the response of other supermarkets , hopefully passing on the full drop in wholesale costs and not just where they feel they need to , will dictate the extent of this potential boost to family budgets			0
' on the rise : the graph shows how prices had dropped in the final months of 2912 but have jumped again in january and february whitewash ? the @entity92 said sharp rises in fuel prices was caused by increases in tax and not price - fixing by oil companies in january motoring groups accused the @entity92 of ‘ a whitewash ’ yesterday after the watchdog ruled out a full inquiry into petrol prices			1
the @entity92 , which launched a probe last year , claimed there was no evidence drivers were being ripped off			0
for years motorists have complained that pump prices soar when the price of crude oil rises , but fail to drop if it then falls			0
@entity112 is coming under mounting pressure to order a fuel duty freeze in this month ’s @entity115 , as experts warned prices were spiralling out of control			1
pressure : @entity112 is being advised to freeze duty on fuel as experts warn prices are going to soar @entity124 mps are urging the chancellor to cancel a 3p - a - litre rise in fuel duty planned for september			1
motoring organisations warned that families could not take much more , following a 6p rise in fuel prices since the start of the year			2
conservative mp @entity133 has dubbed fuel duty a ‘ toxic tax ’ and said action to bring it under control was now more important than raising the income tax threshold , which has been the @entity138 ’s top tax priority			1
‘ this government has done more than almost any other in recent times to reduce the cost of fuel but we need to go further ... in the long term , when the financial conditions allow , to actually cut fuel duty , ' he said			1
‘ when fuel duty goes up it ’s not just a tax on fuel because food prices go up , bus prices go up , it crushes businesses , it crushes families , it ’s a disincentive to work because people ca n’t afford to drive to work			1
’ last week it emerged that the poorest car owners are being forced to shell out more than a quarter of their ready cash to keep a vehicle on the road			0
typically , a poor household will spend £ 44 a week on motoring expenses out of a total seven - day budget of £ 167 , according to the @entity165			2
of this , a total of £ 16 is used to buy petrol or diesel and £ 8.30 goes on insurance			0
this means the most hard - up 10 per cent of car - owning households are having to put at least 27 per cent of their disposable income towards owning and running a vehicle			0
rising costs : the average 5p a litre increase in february added £ 2.50 to the cost of a typical 50 - litre refill by contrast , motoring costs only represent about 12 per cent of the disposable income of the wealthiest car - owning households			1
@entity165 director @entity186 said : ' these figures should shock chancellor @entity112 , with some households mired in transport poverty			0
' we already knew transport was the single biggest area of household expenditure bar none			0
but this spending breakdown just for car - owning households is not normally available			0
it lays bare the truth about the extent of transport poverty in the @entity55			0

@entity11 's announced reductions first before @entity12 and @entity13 followed suit
it comes after months of rises with 5p alone added in the past month
