by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:39 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 04:31 est , 1 january 2014 council plans to change the name of @entity6 village @entity4 to @entity7 have been dropped due to ' overwhelming ' public opposition			1
@entity6 language campaigners had argued the name change was necessary because there is no ' v ' in ancient @entity6			1
however the 1,000 villagers protested , arguing that the name @entity14 would make them the butt of schoolboy jokes , as people unfamiliar with the nuances of @entity6 pronunciation would say it as ' @entity20 '			1
due to ' overwhelming ' opposition , plans to rename @entity6 village @entity4 as @entity7 have been dropped @entity6 campaigners argued that @entity14 would be more accurate as there was no ' v ' in ancient welsh after receiving a letter with 150 signatures opposing the plans , local councillor @entity26 agreed that the new name could bring the town and villagers into ' disrepute '			1
he added : ' whilst we in @entity36 understand the pronunciation , outsiders will say it fart - egg			2
' the change was asked for because most @entity6 street signs display place names in both @entity43 and @entity6			1
at the time @entity44 , 42 , who lives in the village near @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' just imagine how embarrassing it will be to have the word " fart " in your village 's name - never mind being followed by " egg "			2
the 1,000 residents opposed because they were worried that outsiders would pronounce it ' @entity20 ' local councillor @entity59 has hailed the decision as a ' victory for common sense ' ' i 'd be humiliated every time i told someone my address			1
everyone will be laughing at us and coming to get photographed next to the street signs			2
' i just think it 's ridiculous - these @entity6 campaigners are a lot of gasbags , they â€™re full of hot air			1
' fellow villager @entity75 , 62 , said : ' can you imagine the bus going past and some naughty schoolboy shouting : " you are going to @entity20 "			2
it is just a bad joke			0
' following the decision to keep the name @entity4 , councillor @entity59 hailed a victory for ' common sense			1
' speaking to the @entity86 , he added : ' it 's one thing for an outsider to say they have got to do it , it 's the law , but if you live in the village and you do n't want this change it 's a different story			0
' while the villagers of @entity4 may have narrowly escaped the humiliation of being called ' @entity20 ' by passersby , spare a thought for the residents of these unfortunately named places			0
sitting between @entity102 and @entity103 , the hamlet of @entity101 has been voted as officially the most embarrasing place to live by ancestry website www.findmypast.co.uk			0
the tiny hamlet gets its unfortunate name from a literal translation from @entity109 , which meant it sat astride a sewer			0
it is probably best not to speculate as to how @entity112 , near @entity113 got its name , though it could just be an unfortunate counterpart to the nearby @entity116			0
schoolboy taunts could also be levelled at places such as @entity119 , in @entity120 , @entity121 , in @entity122 , and @entity123 in the @entity125 highlands			0
the town of @entity127 misses out on the dubious accolade of most appropriate place name , because it is sadly at the wrong end of the @entity132 , and therefore not next to the beach .			0

due to ' overwhelming ' opposition name will not be changed
councillor hails decision as a ' victory for common sense '
@entity6 *activists* said @entity14 would have been more *authentic*
