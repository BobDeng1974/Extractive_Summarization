that phase of the trial begins wednesday and will include a new round of opening statements and evidence			0
the same jury last month convicted @entity1 in his daughter @entity26 's 2005 beating death			1
the drawn - out case has gained attention in part because it involves a capital offense in a state that does n't have the death penalty			1
@entity8 's territorial government abolished capital punishment in 1957 , before @entity8 became a @entity37 state in 1959			2
but @entity1 was tried in the federal system - which allows for the death penalty - because the crime occurred on military property			1
lawyers for both the prosecution and defense declined comment friday after the jury 's eligibility decision was read			0
@entity1 ' defense team argued he was not eligible for a death sentence because of his low iq			2
mental health experts testified about intellectual impairments and low test scores			0
the prosecution contended factors such as @entity26 's age and vulnerability made the killing so heinous that the death penalty was warranted			1
torture : witnesses testified that @entity62 , 5 , was beaten with belts almost daily when her father became frustrated jurors decided @entity1 met all key conditions to be eligible for the death penalty : he was an adult ; his actions were intentional that resulted in the girl 's death ; and the crime was especially heinous and the victim was vulnerable because of her youth			1
one juror appeared to cry as jurors were polled			0
@entity1 and @entity26 's stepmother , @entity76 , testified during the guilt phase of the trial that they beat her almost daily with hands and belts during the seven months she lived with them in @entity8			1
@entity1 blamed the beatings on the child 's bowel - and bladder - control issues , coupled with frustrations he faced in his marriage			1
his wife , @entity89 , testified against him as part of a deal with prosecutors for a 20 - year sentence			1
she provided graphic and disturbing details of abuse that included withholding food from the girl for days at a time , beatings while the child was duct - taped to a bed , pulling her so hard by the hair that she was left with a bald spot , and stomping on her until bone cracked			0
coverup : the signs of abuse on the girl 's body became so bad that her father pulled her out of kindergarten so nobody would see them the couple eventually took the kindergartner out of school so that others would n't see the signs of abuse on @entity26 's body			2
prosecutors say she died on july 16 , 2005 , after her father dealt a blow so hard it left knuckle imprints on her chest			0
@entity1 said he beat the girl that day partly because of toothpaste she spit onto the bathroom sink			2
the resolution of the case also paves the way for @entity76 ' sentence			0
her public defender , @entity132 , requested that she be immediately sentenced and moved to a mainland prison after she testified , satisfying terms of her plea deal			0
but @entity37 district judge @entity136 ruled that @entity76 must wait until jurors in @entity1 ' trial have been dismissed before she can be sentenced			0
@entity139 , left , wife of @entity1 , right , has also been charged with @entity26 's murder			2
