@entity5 , 39 , lost four stone and dropped four dress sizes after being embarrassed when she bent over at work and her trousers ripped @entity5 says : ' i can laugh about it now , but one day at work i spilled some water in the kitchen and when i bent down to mop it up , i heard this huge rip and there was a large split in my trousers			1
' it was so embarrassing and , what was even worse , was that one of my colleagues was also in the kitchen and saw the whole thing			0
' she must have felt sorry for me because she kindly lent me her jumper so i could tie it around my waist to cover it up			0
that was the moment i knew i has to do something about my weight			0
' the road to losing weight has been a difficult one for @entity5 , and it has taken almost four years to shift the pounds @entity5 , from @entity37 near @entity38 , in @entity39 , who once weighed in at more than 13 - and - a - half stone , started weight - loss program @entity41 in august 2009 , and recorded a 5lb weight loss at her first weigh in			1

' @entity48 is a nursery worker from @entity37 near @entity38 in @entity49 , and she says she was shamed into losing four stone after ripping her trousers at work and having to borrow a jumper from a colleague to hide the tear ' because the majority of my clothes had elasticated waistbands , i did n't see the weight piling on			1
it really dented my confidence and it took me a long time to realise i was unhappy			0
@entity64 breakfast : nothing snack : blueberry muffin and chocolate lunch : chips snack : whatever children in nursery were eating dinner : ready meal @entity75 breakfast : wholesome , healthy meal lunch : soup dinner : chicken ' i just got to the point where i had to do something about it			1

@entity5 explained that simply slipping into bad habits led to her being overweight since her late twenties			1
she said : ' i used to skip breakfast because i had to leave home at either 5.30 or 6.00am to travel to work in @entity94			0
' when i arrived i 'd get a blueberry muffin and hot chocolate almost every day , and it quickly became a habit , just like having snacks with the kids at nursery in the afternoon			2
' most lunchtimes i would pay the local chip shop a visit and have a ready meal in the evening , simply for convenience			0
' @entity5 ' ’s diet now consists of a healthy breakfast , soup for lunch and chicken for dinner most nights			1
' i ’m much more aware of the nutritional value of food and my portions are a lot smaller			0
' i feel so much healthier and happier in myself and have a lot more energy to go out and do the things i like , such as meet up with friends or go for long walks			0
@entity5 before losing the weight , when she used to skip breakfast and then eat a blueberry muffin and hot chocolate when she arrived at work , followed by chips for lunch and a ready meal for dinner her 84 - year - old grandma , @entity132 , was also impressed with @entity5 ’s weight loss - and her granddaughter now receives nice compliments when she goes to visit			1
@entity5 added : ' @entity132 does n’t mince her words , and having previously commented on how big i was , she says how much healthier i look these days			1
' it ’s gone totally in the opposite direction - now she does n’t think i am eating enough ! ' i reassure her that i have a much healthier diet than i did before and am never hungry			2
@entity5 said : ' people have told me that i look amazing - i do n't think any woman will ever tire of hearing that ' ' people have told me that i look amazing - i do n’t think any woman will ever tire of hearing that			2
