@entity2 needs to get real about trying to cut the deficit by hiking tax on the rich , a @entity1 former cabinet minister has claimed			2
@entity5 said bringing back the 50p tax rate would be ‘ absolutely incidental to the state of the public finances ’			1
the former health secretary said it was important not to ‘ kid ourselves ’ about the scale of the deficit and what was needed to balance the budget			1
former cabinet minister @entity5 said @entity16 needed more ' realism ' over the state of the public finances mr @entity5 ’s remarks emerge after @entity16 called a @entity21 debate on the reintroduction of @entity24 ’s 50p tax rate on salaries over £ 150,000			1
the coalition scrapped the rate in 2012 – bringing the top rate of income tax down to 45 per cent			1
chancellor @entity30 claimed the higher rate ‘ raised just a third of the £ 3billion that we were told it would raise ’			2
but the @entity35 chancellor @entity34 announced in january that @entity16 would restore the 50p rate if the party wins power next year			1
mr @entity34 has insisted the hike would be temporary and used to plug the country ’s budget deficit			0
but mr @entity42 said @entity16 ’s spending plans were ‘ big bunts ’ which could not be paid for by simply raising taxes on the wealthy			1
shadow chancellor @entity34 has pledged to reintroduce the 50p top rate of tax on those earning more than £ 150,000 mr @entity5 - pictured with @entity49 - was @entity16 's election co-ordinator in the 2005 general election , won by @entity51 speaking at a progress event at @entity16 conference mr @entity5 was asked if it was the job of left - wing parties to redistribute wealth			1
he said : ‘ i gather that we are going to do that through a 50p tax rate which i mean , whether or not i agree with it , will be absolutely incidental , by the way , to the state of the public finances			1
@entity63 , so let ’s not kid ourselves			2
‘ this is big bunts if you 're talking about a @entity69 style early years system which is what people want , if you 're talking about the best performing schools in the world , which people want , if you 're talking about protecting pensioners , investing in infrastructure , doing all those things , even in the height of the good times not all of that was possible			0
‘ in the bad times it 's certainly not going to be possible			0
‘ so all i ’m saying to you as fellow party members is that we need a note of realism and we need a note of edge as we go into the next general election			0
’ @entity16 's shadow treasury minister @entity90 said the 50p tax rate was necessary to balance the books fairly treasury minister @entity94 claimed the remarks by one of @entity16 ’s ' big beasts ' showed @entity16 did not have ' a credible economic plan '			1
he said : ' they bust the economy and left us with the highest deficit since the war - everyone knows they would do it again			0
@entity2 just is n’t up the job			0
' the @entity107 has said the ‘ raising the top rate of tax would raise little revenue and make , at best , a marginal contribution to reducing the budget deficit an incoming government would face after the next election ’			2
labour peer @entity115 has also attacked the policy as ‘ lousy economics ’			0
but @entity16 has insisted the tax crucial to its ' fair plan to balance the books '			1
@entity90 , @entity16 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said : “ while millions of working people have seen their taxes go up , millionaires have been given a huge tax cut by @entity128 ’s government			1
“ the top one per cent of earners have been given a £ 3 billion a year tax cut – worth an average of £ 100,000 for those earning over £ 1 million			2
“ but at the same time families will be on average almost £ 1,000 a year worse off by next year as a result of tax and benefit changes since 2010			0
“ how can a tax cut for millionaires be the right priority when working people are still not feeling the recovery and the deficit remains high ? “ now the @entity143 want to cut tax credits again for millions of working families while keeping their huge tax cut for top one per cent of earners			0
as we ’ve seen time and time again , the @entity143 always stand up for a privileged few rather than hard working people			0
“ we know their real economic plan is to cut taxes at the top and hope that wealth will just trickle down			0
that ’s why @entity128 and @entity30 still wo n’t rule out cutting the top rate of tax again for earnings over £ 150,000 from 45p to 40p			2
“ working people who are worse off under @entity128 ca n’t afford more of this same old failed @entity161 economics			0
“ as part of our plan to balance the books in the next @entity165 in a fairer way @entity16 will reverse the @entity161 tax cut for millionaires and introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax for 24 million working people			1
