by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:14 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 10:22 est , 25 january 2014 @entity3 is still a danger to the public despite his age , according to a report by mental health experts a report released as part of the child killer 's failed bid to be sent to a mainstream prison yesterday described him as ' an untreated violent and sexual offender ' who is suffering from a ' chronic psychotic illness '			1
the 76 - year - old was told last year his appeal to be sent to a prison to serve his sentence was to be refused for his own health and safety , but yesterday judge @entity23 gave the reasons for the decision in a detailed ruling running to more than 100 pages			1
behind bars : @entity28 ( left ) , 76 , was jailed for life in 1966 along with his now - dead girlfriend @entity30 ( right ) appeal : @entity28 at a mental health tribunal last year when he was seen in public for the first time since the 1980s			1
he was appealing for the right to be released @entity3 , who murdered five children in the 1960s with his lover @entity30 , was jailed for life in 1966			1
he will remain a patient at maximum - security @entity43 on @entity45			0
leading clinical psychologist professor @entity46 , from @entity47 , told the @entity48 that killers ' do n't simply stop being a threat at 76 years old			2
' many people would quibble that is particularly old			0
they can do still things that can be extremely dangerous			0
' he added that the report appears to indicate @entity3 has a volatile nature			1
he said : ' he has a difficult and confrontational relationship with staff			2
' the ruling quoted from his medical history , citing case notes prior to his sentence in 1966 by dr @entity63 , senior physician in psychological medicine , describing @entity3 as ' a ruthless individual , cold and unemotional , without conscience or remorse ... he showed a pathological admiration of power and unscrupulousness '			2
another medical officer later wrote that he is a ' schizoid psychopath of utter untruthfulness who has the rather unusual ability in this type of personality of dissociating himself from the crimes of which he has been convicted ... increasingly i feel that it is a symptom of the terrifying intensity of his psychopathy , and that he is not defending against recalling his offences but that , as far as he is concerned , they fail to rise above his mental horizon			0
' the tribunal accepted @entity3 is suffering from ' chronic psychotic illness ' but there were ' differences in eminent medical opinion ' demonstrating the complexity of his condition			2
victim : @entity96 ( left ) , 12 , who was murdered by @entity28 , and his mother @entity97 , who spent her life calling for the killer to reveal what he did with her son 's body at the end of the hearing , the panel said @entity3 should remain in @entity43 on the grounds that he is insane and hospital staff are best placed to treat his psychosis			1
hospital records showed that @entity3 has hallucinations , continues to talk to himself while alone , has been violent and abusive to other patients and staff , and leads a largely ' nocturnal ' existence - only leaving his room at night and shunning other patients and staff he regards as beneath him			1
in one incident he called another patient a fat f * * * * * * slug , you fat b * * * * * * , sat there '			0
the report added : ' the patient asked what mr @entity3 was talking about , who responded by putting his pen between his knuckles making a fist around it and said : " do you want to do something about it ? " ' it was done in a threatening manner			1
at that stage members of staff intervened and mr @entity3 was asked to go to his room			1
as he was ushered through the ward he stopped to be abusive			0
the staff tried to calm him			2
' he claimed that a patient had been throwing cereal around and smearing honey on chairs to annoy him			0
' @entity3 was also noted as ' baring his teeth and spitting '			2
judge @entity23 said in his full ruling : ' the tribunal concluded that it has been demonstrated by this evidence that it is necessary in the interests of his own health and safety that he be detained in hospital for treatment and that appropriate treatment is available			1
' the tribunal considered that it would be inappropriate to make any recommendation because , in its judgment , it is not appropriate to recommend his discharge			0
' the 116 - page ruling says @entity3 's wishes must be taken into consideration			1
' his views are important because he will spend the rest of his life either in a hospital or in prison			0
' there is no possibility of him being discharged into the community			0
' however , the determination of that issue depends substantially upon his mental condition , about which there is an array of opinions amongst the medical practitioners who gave evidence to the tribunal			0
' investigation : police and volunteers search @entity184 in october 1965 for the bodies of the children killed by @entity3 and @entity30 the tribunal said ' with the benefit of hindsight ' @entity3 should have been transferred to hospital for treatment before he had served 19 years in various prisons			1
the ruling adds : ' one must also remember that he is now a 75 - year - old man			0
when he was in prison he was much younger			0
he is now physically much weaker			0
' but his notoriety has not diminished			0
the inmates of a prison would not be selected as the other patients on the ward are			0
' that would create a significant risk to his safety even though the prison officers are acknowledged to have the skills to deal with such issues			0
' @entity3 has the right to challenge the decision , which would require a further hearing at an @entity209			2
there was no immediate response from his legal team to the findings			0
@entity3 told the tribunal hearing he was merely a ' a petty criminal ' and described his crimes as ' recreational killings ' which were part of an ' existential experience '			2
@entity28 on his way to court in 1966			2
he was described as suffering from ' chronic psychotic illness ' @entity3 's legal team argued that , despite his severe personality disorder , he is not mentally ill and therefore no longer fulfils the legal criteria for detention in hospital			1
@entity3 has suggested that , if he is allowed to go back to a jail , he would be ' free to end his own life ' by starving himself to death			1
last year 's tribunal heard that @entity3 , who claims to have been on a hunger strike since 1999 and is fed through a tube in his nose , in fact eats toast and soup and this is simply a ' protest ' rather than suicidal			1
it was suggested that @entity3 's legal bid showed his pathological need for control and to challenge authority and a craving for the public spotlight			1
@entity30 died in jail in november 2002 , aged 60			0
the child - killer 's Â £ 250,000 taxpayer - funded legal bid to be transferred to a jail was the first time he had been seen in public for decades and was criticised by victims ' families as a ' circus ' and a ' complete waste of taxpayers ' money '			1
yesterday pictures of a man believed to be @entity3 covered in a sheet arriving at hospital were released			1
@entity3 has been receiving treatment at @entity47 's @entity262 after breaking two bones in a fall at @entity264			1
he is understood to have fractured his hip in the fall at @entity43 , where he has been held since 1985 .			0

report says @entity28 , 76 , is an ' untreated violent and sexual offender '
he still *launches* into rages at staff and other patients
@entity3 's bid to be transferred from hospital to jail was rejected for his own health and safety
