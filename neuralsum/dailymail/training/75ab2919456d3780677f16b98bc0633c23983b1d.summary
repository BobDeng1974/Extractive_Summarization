an @entity1 doctor who survived @entity2 recounted the details of his horrifying experience to a congressional committee today on @entity6 as part of a bid to raise awareness about the deadly disease			1
as a medical professional , dr. @entity11 told @entity13 he ' witnessed the horror that this disease visits upon its victims			1
' but after contracting the disease himself in late july while treating @entity2 in @entity19 , @entity11 said he came to understand first - hand the suffering of his patients			1
' i was isolated and unsure if i would ever see my family again , ' he said			2
' even though i knew most of my care givers , i could see nothing but their eyes through their protective goggles when they came to treat me			0
' i experienced the humiliation of losing control of my bodily functions , and i faced the horror of vomiting blood , a sign of the internal bleeding that could have led to my death			0
doctors have been unable to determine whether an experimental drug , a blood transfusion from another @entity2 survivor , specialized care at a medical facility in @entity55 , @entity56 , or a combination of all three saved his life			2
what is evident from his appearance at a joint meeting of the @entity66 health and appropriations committees is that that he is fully rehabilitated			0
sen. @entity68 noted @entity11 's remarkable recovery during the afternoon hearing , noting how happy the committee was to see him			1
' what 's so great about seeing you dr. @entity11 is one , that you 're well enough to be here			1
you were well enough to travel here , ' @entity68 , a senior @entity75 on the committee , said			0
' and you 're well enough that we 're not afraid to have you here			2
and we can smile , but this is a stunning , stunning , stunning accomplishment ! ' the bipartisan group of @entity13 were n't the only @entity1 leaders who were brave enough to meet with @entity11 during his trip to @entity45			1
president @entity84 also sat down with the @entity2 survivor on tuesday afternoon in the @entity86 before leaving @entity45 for a trip to visit a @entity89 facility in @entity56			1
the @entity86 did not release details on the meeting but it did share a photo of a smiling @entity11 and his wife @entity93 sitting in the @entity94 with the president			1
' i had the privilege and honor of meeting with president @entity84 this morning and we discussed his commitment of more military and medical resources to fight this epidemic , ' @entity11 told @entity13 in his opening statement			1
' i thanked him for entering this battle with us in a larger way			0
' the @entity86 released this photo of president @entity84 meeting with dr. @entity11 and his wife , @entity93 , during an @entity94 drop by this morning @entity11 said it was ' imperative ' that the president follow through on his plans to send 3,000 troops to @entity19 and to establish a military control center for coordination , as well as his proposal to build 17 new treatment centers for @entity2 and hold training for medical professionals in the country			1
up to this point , the @entity1 government 's response to the outbreak has ' remained sluggish and unacceptably out of step with with the scope and the size of the problem that is now before us , ' @entity11 testified			2
the disease has already infected close to 5,000 @entity134 and roughly half of them have died			0
' as a survivor , it is not only my privilege , but it is my duty to speak out on behalf of the people of @entity143 who continue to face unspeakable devastation because of this horrific disease , ' @entity11 told the senators			1
@entity11 warned that @entity19 would not be able ' to turn the tide on the disease ' without the $ 88 million the president has requested from @entity150 to fight @entity2 , including $ 58 million that would go toward creating more of the antiviral drug that @entity11 received and another drug believed to be a vaccine			1
' we can not wait , however , for a magic bullet to halt the spread of this virus in @entity143 , ' he said			0
' the current epidemic is beyond anything we have seen before , and it 's time to think outside the box			0
' dr. @entity11 said that communities must be educated on how to properly care for someone who contracts @entity2 because many patients in @entity143 are staying home , where their families either abandon them or care for them in ways that ' almost always results in infection of the caregivers			1
' ' this is a major contributor to the spread of @entity2 and we can not contain the disease with addressing this problem head on , ' he said			2
@entity11 shared the story of one of his patients who contracted the disease from a man whose wife was committed to getting him care regardless of the risk			1
when no one else would help her , @entity11 said his patient , @entity186 , helped put the man in a taxi			2
in the process , @entity186 contracted @entity2 and died on the way to the hospital			2
' if someone had come alongside @entity186 and given him a little bit of education and provided him with the personal protective equipment he needed , his family would still have their father , their son , and their brother , and the world might still have this good @entity40 , ' @entity11 said			2
noting that some government officials had described @entity2 as a fast - moving forest fire , @entity11 told the @entity13 , ' indeed it is a fire			1
' ' it is a fire straight from the pit of hell , ' he said , choking up			0
' we can not fool ourselves into thinking that the vast mode of the @entity210 will protect us from the flames of this fire , ' he continued			0
' instead , we must move quickly and immediately to deliver the promises that have been made and to be open to practical innovative interventions			0
this is the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes			0
' in remarks of his own on the @entity2 epidemic this afternoon president @entity84 said the @entity1 can not ' dawdle ' in responding to the medical crisis			1
if the federal government does not act quickly to stop the outbreak , ' we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected , with profound economic and security implications for all of us , ' @entity84 said in a speech outside the @entity89 center in @entity55			2
' it 's not a mystery			0
we know how to prevent it from spreading			0
we know how to care for those who contract it			0
we know that if we take the proper steps , we can save lives , ' @entity84 said			0
' the world is looking to the @entity1 , and it â€™s a responsibility we embrace			0

dr. @entity11 contracted the disease in late july while treating @entity2 patients in @entity19 ; he has since recovered
