where the likes of sir @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have failed , @entity0 has succeeded			1
it ’s hard to believe @entity6 has spent the past six years out of the game			1
but here he is back at @entity8 , wrapped up to the nines in his training gear after leading a coaching session at chilly @entity12			1
the former @entity14 striker is back in football			1
not that he looks like he has ever been away			2
@entity6 reveals why he decided to take time away from football following his retirement teddy on ... @entity0 i could n’t have asked to work with a better boss for my first real impression of what managerial life is like			1
he ’s been very open with me and i ’ve got the utmost respect for that			2
teddy on ... @entity26 it ’s not now or never for @entity28			2
he ’s getting there and he ’s a still very young man in footballing terms			2
he has surprised me in how good his finishing is			2
but he ’s got to take that on to the pitch			2
with a cool head , he ’ll get goals			2
teddy on ... @entity37 i ’ve loved working with him			2
i ca n’t believe he only had one goal last year and one the previous season			1
he ’s an outstanding talent ... phenomenal			2
he ’s got every finish in the book , so he should be scoring goals			0
@entity6 still looks as fit and sharp as he did throughout the golden years of a career in which he played until 40 , a record age for an outfield @entity49 player			1
@entity8 fans drool at the way @entity6 zips the ball around during pre-match warm - ups			1
up in the stands the talk turns to whether he could still do a job on the pitch			1
so what has kept @entity6 away so long ? ‘ it ’s all about timing , ’ he says			1
‘ i saw @entity4 [ @entity63 ] out in @entity64 last summer - @entity8 and @entity65 crossed paths as we were in the same tournament - and he was like , “ what are you doing here ? ” so i said , “ i do n’t know , what am i doing here ? ” ‘ quite a few managers have tried to get me on that path of taking my badges and doing coaching			1
@entity3 always told me that i need to be involved , not just for myself but for football			1
sir @entity2 always said to me “ get your badges done because you ’ll love it ”			0
' it was the same with @entity82 when he came to @entity8			1
my view was that i was either a player or a coach or a manager			1
it ’s black or white for me			0
but the gaffer ’s call in the summer was just perfect timing and the scenario was , too — on a part - time basis			1
’ @entity6 claims the likes of sir @entity2 and @entity3 tried to get him into coaching the 48 - year - old chats with @entity96 's @entity95 at @entity8 's @entity12 training ground @entity6 spends two days a week working with @entity8 , three if there is a home match			1
and having just returned from a sun - kissed week in @entity102 , it ’s an arrangement that suits him to a tee			1
despite their defeat by @entity105 last weekend , @entity8 have started this season with a bang			1
they have scored twice as many goals ( 20 ) as they managed last season in the opening 12 games and sit just one point below the top four			0
survival is no longer up for discussion			0
the talk is of @entity117 as they eye the ultimate send - off before moving to the @entity119			1
@entity6 , 48 , who had three years as a player at @entity8 , refuses to take the credit , but ultimately he wants to be the man calling the shots at the top			1
‘ i ’m loving it			1
really loving it , ’ he says			1
‘ it has been very different			0
i ’m on the other side of the fence and it ’s a big change			0
the situation with myself and @entity0 was : “ look come in two days a week and see what happens and if you do n’t like it , we ’ll part our ways ”			1
@entity6 had spells at many clubs including @entity139 ( left ) @entity140 ( centre ) and @entity142 @entity6 spent three years as a player at @entity8 between 2004 and 2007 the former frontman @entity144 ( right ) encouraged him to take his coaching badges former @entity8 boss @entity4 ( centre ) also believed @entity6 should go into management ‘ but if i ’m going to do it , i want to be the best i can			1
i ’m an @entity150 type of bloke			0
and i hope that will take me into management			0
that ’s the way i ’m feeling			0
i want to go full steam ahead			0
‘ i ’m a coach at the moment but i ’d like to be a manager			2
’ so how has he it found it working with the likes of @entity26 , @entity37 and @entity161 ? ‘ the players have been very good towards me , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ i ’ve played here , been around the place before and scored goals			0
but it ’s a little bit different trying to explain that to other people			0
@entity6 has been putting on training sessions for the likes of @entity26 ( left ) and @entity169 the former @entity14 international believes it 's ' now or never ' for @entity8 frontman @entity26 @entity8 boss @entity0 called @entity6 in the summer to ask if he would return as a coach ‘ it ’s about getting to know those players			1
it ’s not just about putting on a session			0
it ’s about talking to the players and finding out where they are - discover their mindset - because that ’s crucial			2
i was a little bit apprehensive about coming in and putting on my first session because i do n’t know how it ’s going to go			0
‘ they ’re looking at me and probably thinking , you ’re this ex-player who ’s been around and knows his stuff			0
well , go on then ... show us what you can do			0
and it ’s a bit like , well i ’ve never put on a session before ! @entity8 are currently sixth in the @entity49 table with 18 points from 12 games @entity6 believes @entity8 winger @entity37 is an ' outstanding talent ' ‘ it ’s a little bit of trial and error			1
if you put on two or three bad sessions , they ’ll soon be saying , “ no thanks			0
i ’ll go and do my shooting with someone else ”			0
touch wood , it has not been like that			0
’ @entity6 draws on the experiences of playing under @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity3 , @entity2 , @entity212 and @entity213			1
‘ @entity211 and @entity2 were great , but did n’t really coach much			2
but then there ’s @entity210			0
at @entity215 , he would put on a shooting session and show us exactly what he wanted			0
‘ it was unbelievable at the time for a 19 - year - old boy			1
i was like “ oh , wow ”			0
shooting , heading , volleying			0
and you ’d think , “ right , so that ’s what you want me to do , ” and you ’d try and emulate it			0
@entity6 believes sir @entity2 was the manager he played under , but ' did n't really coach much ' @entity6 believes the way some @entity65 fans treated @entity4 was ' disgusting ' ‘ i ’ve tried to take some of that experience into it			1
‘ i was lucky to have so many great coaches , great managers that i worked under and at the right stage of my career as well			0
‘ you try and think about what would they have said to me at that particular time - what would he have done			2
but i ’ve had a few bad ones along the way too			0
i ’ve seen first - hand the wrong way to do things			2
you ca n’t have it all good			0
despite fans calling for him to be sacked , @entity4 's side are now on a run of six successive victories @entity247 ( left ) and @entity0 patrol the touchline during @entity105 's win against @entity8 @entity6 admits that he will have to be thick - skinned if he is to take up a management role @entity26 is on the cover of @entity8 's programme for saturday 's game with @entity65 ‘ and this is the thing with the boys at @entity256			1
they worked under sir @entity2 and that ’s all they know			0
‘ he was the best , without a doubt , as a manager			0
but they ’ve not sampled the bad managers			0
they ’ve not sampled the ups and downs			0
i ’ve been in and around pretty much every scenario in football			2
’ @entity4 ’s @entity65 visit @entity8 on saturday looking for their seventh straight win — all on the back of heavy criticism from supporters who campaigned for him to be sacked			1
‘ some of it was disgusting , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ you would n’t wish it upon your worst enemy			0
‘ it was the same for @entity0 with some of the stick that he ’s taken			1
but they are thick - skinned these managers			2
you look at them and think , “ how are you taking that ? ” in no other job in the world would you get people barracking in your ear			2
' they ’ll be trying to concentrate on the pitch but all they can hear is thousands of people all around screaming , “ you ’re useless ”			0
how does that work ? so you have to take your hat off and applaud them for doing a good job			2
’ one day people may applaud @entity6 , the manager , for doing a good job too			1
the full interview with @entity6 appears in the official @entity8 programme for the game against @entity65			1
also inside , @entity26 talks about how he has changed his lifestyle and @entity300 looks back on his career with both clubs			0
