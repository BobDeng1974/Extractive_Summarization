former hippie @entity0 has refused to wear shoes for 50 years - even on his wedding day			1
the 69 - year - old is dubbed @entity0 the feet by pubgoers in @entity7 's leafy suburb of @entity8 after insisting : ' i wo n't put the buggers back on until the day i die '			1
a former telephone exchange engineer , he even eschewed footwear on the day he married his wife @entity13			1
but she did n't mind : they are still happily wed 44 years later and have three grandchildren			2
they are still together , and he says he never feels the cold even in mid-winter @entity0 has become the stuff of legend in local pubs , where he hawks homemade merchandise including stickers and cigarette lighter covers bearing his logo of two bare feet			1
those who know him well have been shown one of his two amputated little fingers - which had to be partially removed due to ' tendon problems ' - which he keeps mummified in resin in his pocket			1
the other is in formaldehyde on the mantelpiece of his £ 90,000 @entity8 flat			1
' i do n’t like shoes , or in fact anything on my feet , ' he said			1
' even when i got married , i did n’t wear shoes - and that was in a church			1
' my wife has maybe seen me wearing shoes once or twice , but my daughter has n’t and my granddaughters definitely have n’t			1
hippie : locals said the much - loved eccentric ( pictured in 1973 ) paints his nails to make up for a lack of shoes best foot forward : the sociable @entity0 ( left on his wedding day and right in 1980 ) is widely - known in @entity8 , where he is known to show pub - goers his amputated little finger which he keeps in resin in his pocket ' they just do n’t suit me , they do n’t suit my feet			1
ever since taking my shoes off permanently , i ’ve been called called @entity0			1
i wo n’t put the buggers back on until the day i die			1
' the pensioner said he stopped donning footwear for good as a hippie in the mid-sixties			2
he was in his 20s and had already tried to escape the constraints of footwear but was scolded repeatedly by his mother			2
' as far back as i can remember , i never liked wearing shoes , ' he said			1
' i was walking home once when i was 16 and took my shoes and socks off and flung them over a bridge			2
' he insists that in the last 50 years his bare feet have never got cold - even when temperatures are sub-zero			0
favourite ale : @entity0 ( above in 1981 ) has his own beer glass in which he sinks pints of @entity101 - brewed @entity100 following in their footsteps : @entity0 ( left in 1967 , right in 1969 ) said many hippies eschewed shoes in the sixties character : pete in 1971			1
he worked as a telephone exchange engineer and has lived in @entity8 for 50 years humans first began wearing shoes 40,000 years ago - but there is still a strong ' barefoot movement ' among activists who say we should return to how nature intended			1
especially in cities , the dangers are obvious			0
they include cuts which can become dangerously infected or lead to illnesses such as tetanus , while people on beaches fear stepping on drug needles			0
it 's a common myth that it 's illegal to drive barefoot - in fact , the @entity126 only specifies that ' clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner '			2
that counts out loose - fitting flip flops			0
much of the stigma is about poverty - bare feet were seen as a sign of homelessness and many bars and restaurants have entry policies which bar people without shoes			2
but a burgeoning barefoot movement is trying to ' reclaim ' the trend , insisting many commonly - held myths are untrue			2
activists say shoes are no better than feet at repelling germs , correcting posture or preventing all but the most serious injuries			2
' they swear blind that they must be freezing but i tell people to touch them and they always reel back because my feet are hot , ' he claimed			2
' people get cold feet because they wear shoes and socks			0
' he uses a mobility scooter - with the personalised numberplate @entity163 1 - but says that is to do with his ' icky ticker ' as he had a heart attack some years ago , and his feet are still in perfect health			0
' people seem to think that i collect dirt , but the fact is that i wash my feet every day , ' he said			0
' if i stand in anything that i should n’t then i really know about it , but if you ’re wearing shoes you might not realise then trample it all over the bloody carpet			1
' where as i know i stand in it then i can just wash it off my feet dead easy			0
' he added : ' in the sixties it was n’t uncommon to see people not wearing shoes around @entity8 , it was very hippy place back then			1
' i find my notoriety a bit silly , i do n’t think people should be so bothered - i find it amusing really			0
' i do get nasty comments but it does n’t bother me			0
sometimes i ’ll go to the pub and they say sorry i ca n’t serve you , you have n’t got shoes on			1
' one time i was told that staff could n’t serve me because they sold food , but as i was being taken out there was woman with a dog , feeding it at the table			0
' i ’ve been into pubs where there ’s dog muck on the floor in the pub , and they say i ’ll bring dirt in			0
it ’s their fault , not mine			0
' the pensioner has been honoured in multiple pubs around the country with his own glass inscribed with his name , from which he drinks his favourite @entity101 - brewed @entity100 ale			0
a little help : the pensioner rides a vintage mobility scooter , but it is more to do with his heart than his feet merchandise : as well as making stickers and cigarette lighters , @entity0 has the personalised scooter plate @entity163 1 @entity230 , 26 , a supervisor at the @entity231 at the @entity233 pub , told @entity234 : ' i 've known him since i was ten			1
he knows my mum and used to buy me crisps after school			0
' i do n't ever remember him wearing shoes			2
he 's always painted his toenails different colours though			0
' everyone knows him and speaks to him and buys him drinks			0
he 's got both of his little fingers amputated and he 's mummified one in resin which he keeps in his pocket			1
the other one 's in formaldehyde on his mantelpiece			0
' he 's a local legend			0
i expect his feet are like leather by now			0
