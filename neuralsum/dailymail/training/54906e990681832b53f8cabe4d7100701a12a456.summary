the binmen , from @entity7 , said that new health and safety rules meant they could n't collect the waste , claiming the bag had become jammed			1
@entity12 , 39 , from @entity13 , owns the bin and has called the decision ' bonkers '			1
@entity12 , 39 , a mother - of - three from @entity13 has hit out at @entity7 after workers refused to empty her bin which had a bag caught in the lid the mother - of - three said : ‘ surely there ’s common sense that tells you that you can lift a bin lid up to see if the bin is overflowing or not , or whether a bag ’s just caught			1
' they did n’t even bother to do that			0
they go on about health and safety of their workers , but what about the health and safety of my family ? ' we ’re a family of five , i ’ve got a young baby and i ’ve now got to store a month ’s worth of bin rubbish			2
’ however when she complained officials told her she would have to wait a fortnight for the binmen to come back , as workers are being told not to empty any bin which is left open , whether it is overflowing or not			1
in a statement , the council said : ‘ as you know , due to health and safety regulations , the binmen are now not emptying bins where the lid is open			2
this is a procedure that they are following very strictly			0
‘ it is unlikely that the men will call back to empty your bin			2
i understand that in this case it was not due to the bin overflowing			0
i have therefore passed your concerns onto the waste management team for information			0
’ the workers claimed that a bag had become jammed in the lid ( pictured ) and that they could n't empty it for ' health and safety reasons ' mrs @entity12 claims there are another eight or ten bins that have not been collected because the lids have been left open under the draconian new rules			1
local councillor @entity78 said common sense had not been used , adding : ‘ i ’ve seen buckets where the lid is halfway open and it ’s full			0
' the policy at the moment is that the guys would n’t touch that , but this particular one is only a smidgeon – a wee bit – open			0
they ’ve maybe taken the guidelines too strictly			0
’ @entity7 is receiving about 200 calls a day from residents about bins not being collected by the 100 staff that work in waste management .			2

@entity12 , from @entity13 , has complained to @entity7
workers refused to empty *wheelie* bin because a bag was caught in the lid
@entity7 says she will have to wait two weeks for them to come back
new health and safety rules mean no open bins will be emptied
