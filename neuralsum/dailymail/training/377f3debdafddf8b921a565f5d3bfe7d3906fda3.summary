the @entity16 feature was originally introduced in 2011 as part of @entity12 4.0 , also known as @entity18 , but despite this , it is still a relatively unknown tool			1
it can recognise a person ’s face and recent updates mean it can even establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real , or is a photograph			0
@entity9 launched its facial recognition feature called face unlock when it released @entity12 4.0 in 2011 - but it could be bypassed by holding a photo up to the screen			1
during the update to android 4.1 in july 2012 , @entity9 added a ' liveness ' check			1
the user must now blink during authentication to confirm they are alive and not a static image			0
however , some users were still able to bypass this using photo editing tricks to set up @entity16 , people with @entity12 phones running @entity18 or higher can go to @entity46 , @entity47 , click on @entity48 and select @entity16			1
the set - up wizard will then ask the user to take a photo of their face , using the device ’s front - facing camera			0
it will also advise if the lighting or positioning is n’t clear enough			0
once a photograph is taken it is stored in an encrypted file and each time a person wants to unlock their phone with their face , the @entity12 system will cross-reference the image with this original photograph			2
as a backup , users need to additionally set up a screen lock pattern or pin , in case the camera breaks or fails to recognise their face			1
this can happen in poor lighting , for example			0

when @entity9 launched face unlock it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet 's camera			2
in the update to @entity106 in july 2012 , @entity9 added a ' liveness ' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices			2
this meant a user would have to blink while using @entity16 to prove they were alive			0
a number of @entity116 users reported problems with the @entity16 feature when the phone launched earlier this year , but @entity9 has said that these bugs should be fixed with the introduction of @entity12 4.4 @entity122			1
in june , details emerged of a @entity9 patent , pictured , that would let users unlock their phones by pulling silly faces , such as frowning , poking out their tongue or wriggling their nose			2
the expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user 's identity in june , details emerged of a @entity9 patent that would let users unlock their phones by pulling silly faces , such as frowning , poking out their tongue or wriggling their nose			2
the expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user 's identity			0
the patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user 's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible			0
it is likely this feature may appear in future versions of the @entity12 operating system , although a precise release date has n’t been announced .			1

@entity9 introduced @entity16 in @entity12 4.0 @entity18
it acts as an alternative to screen locks involving a pattern or a pin
the feature is n’t as secure as @entity8 ’s fingerprint scanner because it can be unlocked for people with similar faces
android @entity122 *improved* a number of bugs in the tool on @entity116 *handsets*
