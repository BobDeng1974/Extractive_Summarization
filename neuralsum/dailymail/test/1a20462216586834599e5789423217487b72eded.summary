winger @entity0 stole the limelight from @entity2 and @entity3 as @entity4 thrilled a 14,175 crowd at the @entity6 with an exciting 30 - 20 win over @entity8			1
most eyes before kick - off were on @entity11 as he prepared to make his return from a six - month suspension imposed for punching @entity14 in october 's @entity16 defeat by @entity17			1
and the @entity4 fans were delighted at half - time when the club announced the re-signing of @entity3 on a four - year deal from @entity23 , starting next season			1
@entity4 winger @entity0 scored a hat - trick for the second time in five days all eyes were on @entity2 on thursday night as he made his return from a six - month ban after being sent off for punching @entity14 in the opening moments of @entity4 's @entity16 defeat by @entity17 last october			1
reception : @entity2 's name was greeted with huge cheers when the team announcement was made 10 minutes before kick - off and there was a deafening roar 23 minutes into the match when he made his entrance , with @entity4 fans on their feet for a standing ovation			2
performance : the @entity44 came up with a knock - on four minutes into his return and clearly looked rusty after his lengthy lay - off			0
he produced some strong charges , however , and did his fair share of tackling before taking a breather after 32 minutes			0
@entity2 later returned for the last four minutes , by which time his side were firmly in charge			2
overall : a steady if unspectacular return for the former @entity53 front rower in a match dominated by the tryscoring prowess of his young outside back team - mates			0
unsurprisingly rusty at times , he will be better for his 36 - minute contribution , made in two spells			0
by the end of a pulsating derby , however , it was the name of 21 - year - old @entity0 which was on most people 's lips after he scored a second hat - trick in five days			1
@entity0 had touched down three times in @entity4 's 34 - 0 win over @entity70 on sunday and he once more demonstrated his exceptional ability to finish off the @entity72 after they had taken the lead for a third time early in the second half			2
@entity8 could hardly have made a better start , scoring two tries inside the first 10 minutes as they monopolised the early play			0
skipper @entity79 had gone close in the opening moments after gathering @entity82 's high kick to the corner and he enjoyed an unopposed run - in after taking @entity86 's cut - out pass to open the scoring			0
@entity86 added the touchline conversion and the visitors increased their lead when @entity91 went through the attempted tackle of his opposite number @entity94 for the first of his two tries			0
@entity4 barely had touched the ball at that stage but they quickly demonstrated their attacking flair with two superbly - crafted touchdowns			0
stand - off @entity101 came up with a break for the first but it was a magnificent final pass from winger @entity106 that enabled @entity109 second rower @entity107 to finish off the move @entity2 ( centre ) returned to action after serving six - month ban for punching @entity14 moments later @entity114 - bound @entity106 was again the provider as full - back @entity116 , making amends for the first of two bad handling errors , went over for the @entity23 ' second try , with @entity123 's second goal edging his side in front			1
that was the signal for @entity4 coach @entity127 to reintroduce flower but there was little scope for the forwards to get into the action as the outside backs continued to dominate			0
the lead changed hands twice more before half - time , with @entity91 going through @entity94 for his second try - only for @entity0 to cancel it out by taking advantage of some outrageous offloads from @entity140 and @entity141 to score his first			1
@entity142 enjoyed a low key return as the @entity4 backs ran @entity8 ragged in the second half leading 16 - 14 at the break , the highly - impressive @entity140 twice took the wrong option as @entity4 were the first to attack in the second half and the misses began to look costly when when @entity8 second rower @entity149 sliced through the home defence for his side 's fourth try to put them back in front			2
@entity4 were not to be denied , however , and @entity0 went over twice in eight minutes to complete his hat - trick and apply the finishing touches to a splendid victory			1
the hosts produced some quick hands to get him over on 61 minutes but it needed a huge slice of good fortune for him to complete his hat - trick , with @entity123 's drop - goal attempt charged down and falling nicely for the big winger after @entity140 had instinctively put his boot to the loose ball .			2
