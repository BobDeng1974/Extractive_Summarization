an independent @entity1 would find itself at the back of the queue to get into the @entity4 , @entity0 claimed today			1
the prime minister said @entity1 would have to wait its turn behind @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 before it would be readmitted			1
mr @entity0 's provocative remarks come after the @entity11 announced that they now backed full income tax powers for the @entity13 - if the country voted to stay in the @entity15			1
@entity0 told workers at an electrical goods warehouse in @entity18 that @entity1 would not automatically get back into the @entity4 if it left the @entity15			1
he said the country would have to apply like every other country @entity0 risked a @entity22 backlash by going much further than @entity23 in offering new powers to @entity1 in a bid to persuade voters to reject independence later this year			1
the pm 's remarks are also likely to infuriate @entity1 nationalists who insist that the country would not even have to reapply for membership of the @entity4 if it voted for independence			1
mr @entity32 has predicted that negotiations to stay in the @entity4 ' will be completed within the 18 - month period between a yes vote in september and achieving independence in march 2016 '			2
but @entity35 president @entity34 has said it would be ' extremely difficult , if not impossible ' for @entity1 to join			2
today mr @entity0 insisted @entity1 would have to ' queue up ' like all other countries trying to get into the @entity39 club			1
he also hit out at @entity32 's decision to block @entity1 living in @entity41 from taking part in september 's independence referendum			2
mr @entity0 said it was a ' source of regret ' that @entity1 people living in the rest of the @entity15 would not be able to vote in the poll - but insisted that the decision was mr @entity32 's			2
the @entity5 made the remarks on the campaign trail in @entity18 this morning ahead of thursday 's by - election			0
he said : ' if @entity1 vote for independence they are no longer members of the @entity4 and it 's become clearer and clearer since this campaign started that they would have to reapply to join the @entity4 and as such , as an independent country , they would have to queue up as it were behind other countries - for instance those in the western @entity61 that are already on the path towards membership			1
' this is yet another reason why i very much hope that the @entity1 people will vote no , will vote to remain in the @entity15			2
i think we 're a successful family of nations all bringing something to this @entity15			0
' let 's hope that we 'll stay together			0
i think the risks of separation are very great			0
' mr @entity0 was in @entity18 campaigning on behalf of the conservative candidate @entity75 in the upcoming by - election , where he is desperate to hold off @entity78 's challenger @entity77 @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity8 are all categorised as candidate countries by the @entity4 , meaning they are in the process of integrating their laws with the @entity4			1
mr @entity0 said he was ' confident ' that the no campaign would win and said the issue of @entity86 was just one of the risks			0
he added : ' the risk that outside the @entity15 you would n't keep the pound , the risk that outside the @entity15 you 've got to reapply to the @entity4 , the risk that outside the @entity15 you would n't have such a strong economy with so many jobs and you know in the end its a positive argument i 'm making because i think the @entity15 has been a great success story			2
' we 're there for each other			0
you know when there was a banking crisis and a big @entity1 bank goes down you 've got the whole of the @entity15 there to support that bank and that economy			2
we 're stronger and better off together			0
' we obviously have great rivalry on the football field and rugby field and one or two other things but we 're a family of nations and i hope we stay together			0
' @entity1 @entity118 leader @entity117 today u-turned on her previous opposition to further devolution by backing plans to hand the @entity123 full income tax powers some @entity11 warned the move would fuel resentment in @entity41 and disenfranchise @entity1 who do not want the @entity123 to have chance to levy swingeing new taxes on the better off			1
mp @entity129 said : ‘ this is an idiotic idea that will only serve to hasten the break - up of the @entity15			0
' how can you have a referendum where you get more independence whether you vote yes or no ? ' where does that leave people who want to preserve the @entity4 as it is ? ’ @entity1 @entity118 leader @entity117 meanwhile today came out in support of full tax raising powers for @entity1			1
she said @entity123 was like ' a tricycle ' where politicians can spend without any accountability for their actions in the tax system			2
she has pledged to ' take the stabilisers off ' and give the @entity150 full control over income tax if it votes no to independence , as part of the @entity11 ' devolution offering drafted by former @entity155 , @entity156			1
mr @entity0 and chancellor @entity158 have backed the proposals , ms @entity117 said			0
launching the report of the @entity161 in @entity162 , ms @entity117 said : ' what we have at the moment is like a tricycle , what the @entity167 brings in is a bike with stabilisers , and what this builds on is taking the stabilisers off			0
first minister @entity32 has dismissed promises by the unionist parties to hand more powers to @entity176 in the event of a ' no ' vote			0
he has also insisted that an independent @entity1 will not have to reapply to join the @entity4 ' so it does allow @entity179 to take decisions not just over the rates of taxation that we levy , but it also allows them to vary one or more			1
' it allows them to introduce a new band of income tax			1
it allows them to find the formula that best allows the work that the particular government of the day wants to carry out and has a mandate for in @entity1			0
' i think that flexibility shows a responsibility			0
' @entity1 vat receipts should also be given to the @entity123 , according to the @entity161			1
@entity123 should be given more responsibility on some welfare issues , particularly where a cash benefit is related to a devolved policy area such as housing benefit and attendance allowance , it said			0
