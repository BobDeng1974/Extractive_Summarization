by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:20 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 06:13 est , 8 october 2013 @entity3 would commit ‘ economic suicide ’ if it left the @entity4 , @entity2 warned today as he issued a rallying cry to voters , companies , charities and even the policy to defeat eurosceptics			1
the deputy prime minister pleaded with pro-europeans to speak out in favour of the @entity4 before it is too late and @entity3 finds it has ‘ stumbled out ’ of @entity16			0
he urged people drop @entity19 views into conversation and flood @entity21 and @entity23 with messages , arguing ‘ anyone and everyone who can see that there is strength in numbers in today ’s world ’			1
rallying cry : deputy prime minister @entity2 urged pro-europeans to speak out warning : mr @entity2 used a speech at the @entity35 factory to concede that a referendum on @entity37 was now inevitable @entity38 has promised to renegotiate links with @entity16 and put it to a public vote by the end of 2017 if he is in power after the next election			1
in a major speech today , mr @entity2 claimed the prime minister ’s timetable was ‘ chosen for internal party management ’ and says it would be better for a referendum to be in response to the next change to @entity4 rules			1
however , he now accepted a referendum on the @entity3 's membership of the @entity4 was inevitable			2
mr @entity2 has written to more than 100 organisations , including business and trade groups and charities , pleading with them to speak out in support of the @entity4			1
timing : the @entity63 leader said it would be better for a referendum to be in response to the next change to @entity4 rules i am writing to you ahead of a speech i will be giving tomorrow arguing the case for @entity3 ’s continued membership of the @entity4			1
every day @entity3 businesses , families , charities and organisations of all kinds benefit from @entity3 being in the @entity4 - whether through trade , jobs or our influence in tackling the big global issues that matter			1
yet as the debate on this issue intensifies , the @entity19 case is increasingly being drowned out			2
i want to use my speech as a rallying cry to ask people like you , who believe that @entity3 is stronger in than out , to speak up about what we gain from the @entity4 and what we risk losing if we leave			0
this is not a party political issue			0
i am not urging you to support the @entity63			2
yes , @entity37 needs reform			2
but we need to lead from the front and work at that from within @entity37			2
if we want @entity37 to deliver for @entity3 we need to stay in the room and win the argument			2
if you believe the @entity4 offers the best future for @entity3 – join in the debate			0
let people know how much this matters to your work			0
you can also tweet to let people know why you think we are better off in at # @entity110			0
together let ’s stand up for a proud @entity3 leading in a better @entity4			0
best wishes @entity2 speaking in @entity113 , @entity114 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i am not asking you to get involved in the party politics			1
i ’m not asking you to support the @entity63			2
‘ but i am asking you to be part of a coalition for the national interest – standing up for @entity3 remaining in @entity37 ; for a @entity3 that is richer , safer , greener and stronger in the world			2
’ he said every company that buys or sells ‘ across the channel ’ , groups representing business interests , big banks and small family firms all had an interest in staying in the @entity4			0
he said he was also calling on ‘ the hundreds and thousands of @entity129 who ’ve relocated to @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 ’ to speak out			0
in a surprise move he also called on ‘ the police ; the charities who pick up the pieces when men , women and children are trafficked across our borders ; the human rights organisations that want to make sure @entity3 citizens stay signed up to the protections in @entity4 law … ‘ the green groups who want a @entity3 that can lead the way on climate change ; the farmers and fisherman who need a level playing field in @entity37 ; the millions of @entity3 consumers who get better , cheaper products because we ’re a member of the @entity4 ; and anyone and everyone who can see that there is strength in numbers in today ’s world			1
’ he urged them all to tweet using the hashtag # @entity166 , post messages on @entity23 and personal websites , write to the government , write to the newspapers and drop it in to conversations with family and friends			0
mr @entity2 said mr @entity38 ’s strategy for a renegotiation of the relationship with @entity16 was doomed because it would not be accepted by his party			1
characterising the plan , with its 2017 deadline , as a political fix to end internal @entity183 divisions in the run - up to the 2015 general election , mr @entity2 said the prime minister was ‘ playing with fire ’ and ‘ it is @entity3 that will get burned ’			1
he added : ‘ i do n't think it 's very complicated to imagine circumstances in which you could reform here , have a little smidgen of repatriation there , a treaty wording change there			0
‘ that 's not really the issue			0
the issue is i do n't believe that will ever meet the test which is actually being set by the vast part of the @entity183 , which is that they do n't just want another treaty change with a bit of reform , they want a complete semi-detachment or indeed total exit of the @entity4			0
‘ that 's why i think the whole strategy is flawed , because it is raising expectations , certainly among the ranks of the conservative party , which will not be met by that process			0
’ taking sides : mr @entity2 called for a ' fundamental and visceral debate about what side are you on in this basic divide ' mr @entity2 believes next year 's @entity37 elections will be fought as a proxy for the choice between remaining in or leaving the 28 - member block			1
most @entity37 elections have been a ‘ mid-term plebiscite on the performance of the government of the day ’ but this contest would be more ‘ fundamental ’			2
he said : ‘ now is the time to have a much more fundamental and visceral debate about what side are you on in this basic divide - are you basically for leading the reform of the @entity4 by being committed to it , or are you half out the door , or do you advocate exit altogether			0
’ mr @entity2 said among the reforms he would like to see would be an end to the ‘ bonkers ’ situation where the @entity244 alternates between @entity16 and @entity245			1
‘ some of its working practices , not least its second seat in @entity245 , are totally bonkers and should be changed , ’ he said			0
however , @entity249 , chief executive of @entity251 campaign group business for @entity3 , said : ' @entity2 has shown today that he is out of touch with how the majority of the @entity3 people , including thousands of @entity3 business people , feel about the @entity4			1
' if he thinks that the @entity244 alternating between @entity16 and @entity245 is the only ' bonkers ' aspect that needs changing , he should go and speak to the bosses at companies across @entity3 , drowning in a sea of absurd @entity4 directives and regulations			0
' @entity264 general secretary @entity263 praised mr @entity2 for highlighting some of the workplace rights that are enshrined in @entity4 law			1
' his views are in stark contrast with the prime minister who wants to offer the dismal choice between leaving the @entity4 or staying in a @entity37 stripped of rights at work , ' she added .			1

@entity63 leader *suggests* people drop @entity19 views into conversation
mr @entity2 has written to organisations which benefit from being in @entity37
admits an in - out referendum is now inevitable but warns against timing
