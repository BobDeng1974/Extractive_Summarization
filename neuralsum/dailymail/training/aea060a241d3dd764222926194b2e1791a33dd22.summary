by @entity0 who does n't want a washboard stomach , toned abs and buns of steal ? well , according to a controversial new theory from an @entity8 weight - loss expert , perhaps not as many of us as you 'd think			1
sociologist dr @entity10 believes that desperate dieters often want to retain their flab -- even if they do n't realise it			1
@entity14 based dr @entity13 outlines her surprising theory on a @entity17 blog , where she says that , despite common wisdom , there are many benefits to being overweight			1
she goes on to suggest that when dieters struggle to stick to regimes , they 're often subconsciously sabotaging their own attempts because they want to retain their excess pounds			2
dr @entity10 believes that acknowledging the reasons dieters might like being overweight will help them achieve their goal ' there are advantages to remaining overweight			1
if you are not aware of these benefits and why you 're holding on to your extra weight , then no amount of dieting will keep those pounds at bay for good , ' writes the sociologist , who runs @entity39 , a non-dieting weight loss programme in @entity14			1
talking to the @entity41 about her controversial theory , dr @entity13 explained , ' it surprises many people that being overweight can serve a function			1
' while a part of you feels bad about being overweight and despises having extra weight , there may be another part of you that is holding onto it , ' she says			2
dr @entity10 , whose surprising theory on weight loss challenges the usual dieting theories so what are these hidden benefits of carrying some extra inches ? dr @entity13 outlines four classic examples from clients : 1			1
" my reason for not doing things in life has been my weight			2
when i lose it , i wo n't have an excuse to put off life , such as applying for another job , or even getting on a flight " 2			2
" having extra weight means i can blend into the background , without being the focus of attention , and i do n't feel that i 'm ' on show ' " 3			2
" weight makes me feel protected from other people			0
i think i might feel vulnerable if i lost it			0
" dr @entity13 also refers to her personal weight loss experience			2
' i recall feeling anxious or nervous about the increased personal power that i felt as the weight gradually fell off me , ' she admits			0
but says , ' i â€™ve had some angry responses to my blog from people who believe i am blaming them for their weight			0
this is partly because there is such a culture of blaming overweight people			0
' instead this blog seeks to encourage people to step back with awareness and bring more understanding and non-judgement to their weight and eating habits			0
' what dr @entity13 hopes is that readers will use this theory to help them on their weight loss journey			2
' if you have recently lost weight and fear that you will gradually regain the pounds , then it is crucial that you look at the reasons why you might be holding onto extra pounds , ' she says			0
' during all of my 16 years dedicated to chronic dieting and feeling out of control around food , one of my enduring beliefs was that being slim meant i would be lighter , happier and confident			0
' after a few weeks of being ' good ' and in control ( as opposed to tucking into toast with melted butter , biscuits and any food not nailed down ) the result , when i stepped on the bathroom scales , was that my weight had dropped , ' she says			0
do n't blame the biscuits ! a new theory suggests failing dieters want to be overweight but she admits , ' weeks of being good were suddenly unraveled in a moment of stress or anxiety			1
and is n't it amazing how much food you can eat in five minutes ? ' the @entity8 expert then explains , ' i was desperately seeking slimness but never thought to ask myself " why have i put myself in the position of being overweight again ? " , " is a part of me holding onto my weight ? " ' although a part of you does not want that extra weight and desperately wants to shed it , is there another part of you holding onto that weight ? ' you might never have considered these questions : why have you chosen to be overweight ? what 's in it for you by being overweight ? ' it 's not surprising that when dr @entity13 asks her clients if there are reasons they want to remain overweight , they usually respond with expression of incredulity and disbelief			1
but she believes there are advantages to remaining overweight , which dieters have to confront before successfully shedding pounds			1
' a new slim body means a smaller version of yourself			0
you no longer have the fat to protect you , ' she says			0
' you may feel more fragile and vulnerable			0
having extra weight has protected you			0
without it you may feel exposed			0
that 's one reason why many people who lose weight regain it			1
' dr @entity13 concludes , ' if you are not aware of the benefits of your weight and your concerns about letting it go , you will struggle to reach and maintain a healthy weight			1
' dr. @entity10 is director of www.heydayworld.com , which offers groups and online weight - loss programmes			1

despite society 's view of being fat , dr @entity10 says there are benefits to being overweight
believes dieters often fail because they do n't acknowledge these benefits
admitting why you want to be fat might help lose weight
