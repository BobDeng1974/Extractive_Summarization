he said : ' i think it ’s safe to say that our ads could be considered controversial and definitely push boundaries			0
' due to advertising regulations we were not permitted to include the product in the ad , so we decided to take a tongue - in - cheek approach to appeal to an adult audience and communicate the superior taste of vip products , whilst making it clear that the product does contain nicotine and that they are only available to smokers over the age of 18			1
' we anticipated that the creative treatment for this campaign would cause comment and we were ready for this , but i want to make it very clear that as a leading e-cigarette manufacturer we take our responsibilities extremely seriously which is evident in our decision not to broadcast the ads before the watershed and follow the advertising rules closely			2
