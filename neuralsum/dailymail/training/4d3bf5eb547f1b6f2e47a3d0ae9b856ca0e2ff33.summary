a moving new campaign has been launched to help ex-cons adjust to society by transforming their prison tattoos into colorful works of art. the @entity7 project , a collaboration between the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , and ad agency @entity12 , was created to ' transform crude , hideous amateur tattoos made in prisons and juvenile detention centers into professional , socially well - perceived artistic tattoos , that will help them find a job ' , according to its website			1
in a @entity23 video describing the project , @entity21 professor @entity20 explains why prison tattoos are harder to remove than ink designs done in regular parlors			1
' removing them is hard and leaves visible scars			1
they stigmatize and discourage potential employers			2
' the video shows two formerly incarcerated women having their tattoos camouflaged by new designs			1
one explains that she had the word ' vendetta ' inked on the back of her neck at a juvenile detention center eight years ago , and was eager to have it covered for the sake of her children			2
after meeting with a @entity7 artist , she is told that her prison ink can be camouflaged and transformed into a piece of art that she will be proud to show her children			1
before : ' for twelve years , i have n't looked at my arms , ' another woman says , revealing a crudely - drawn shark tattoo ( pictured ) she received in prison after : she has the shark tattoo transformed into a pretty red floral pattern ( pictured ) emotional : ' now i can discover a part of myself again			2
now , i can take another step , ' she says after seeing the new design and when she sees the beautiful floral artwork that has replaced the basic wording , she exclaims : ' @entity84 ... the " vendetta " is gone ! ' a few weeks after her tattoo transformation , she adds : ' now everything is different			1
and when my tattoo was healing , my son would come to me with an ointment to put on my wounds			2
this program gave me a great chance			2
a chance to start a new life			0
' the other woman , who has lived with a crudely - drawn shark tattoo for more than a decade , reveals : ' for twelve years , i have n't looked at my arms			0
i just do n't look at myself in the mirror			0
it 's like i do n't have a part of myself			0
' after her tattoo is transformed into an elaborate floral design , she is overcome with emotion			0
fresh start : the women work with the @entity7 artists to create a meaningful design that will camouflage their prison ink mission statement : the project was launched to show that ' social rehabilitation is not about erasing the past , but rather building on it based on one 's talents and passions ' happy ending : ' @entity84 ... the " vendetta " is gone ! ' the first woman exclaims when she sees her new tattoo ' now i can discover a part of myself again , ' she says			1
' now , i can take another step			0
and this is fantastic because i do n't have to be locked up anymore in that gray world that held me back			0
' professor @entity20 further explains the significance of adding to the tattoos rather than eliminating them altogether			1
' at @entity21 , we teach that social rehabilitation is not about erasing the past , but rather building on it based on one 's talents and passions			0
sometimes the slightest change in one 's life can bring the best results , ' he says			0
' if they decided to get tattoos , then it means that they wanted to express something			1
we help them express themselves better			0

the @entity7 project is a joint effort from the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , and ad agency @entity12
