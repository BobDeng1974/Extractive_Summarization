by @entity0 forget luxury machines and expensive beans , scientists have uncovered the secret behind the perfect cup of coffee - reasonably hard tap water			1
coffee - loving experts used different types of water to find out how coffee flavours differed			0
they found water composition made a ‘ dramatic difference ’ to coffee from the same bean - with certain types of hardness boosting the taste			1
sodium rich water - such as that produced by water softeners - was also not beneficial to taste , according to chemist @entity30 of the @entity31			0
‘ coffee beans contain hundreds of chemicals ; the precise composition depends on the type of bean and how it is roasted , ’ mr @entity30 , a phd student at the university ’s @entity32 , said			1
@entity39 ‘ coffee beans contain hundreds of chemicals ; the precise composition depends on the type of bean and how it is roasted , ’ say the scientists ‘ the flavour of the resulting coffee is determined by how much of these chemicals are extracted by the water , which is influenced by roast profile , grind , temperature , pressure and brew time			1
‘ we ’ve found that the water composition is key to the proportions of sugars , starches , bases and acids extracted from a particular roast			2
’ the coffee industry currently uses guidelines on the ideal water for coffee extraction from the @entity64 of @entity65 , which puts emphasis on measuring ionic conductivity to quantify the total dissolved solids			0
however , the research found it was in fact the proportions of these ions that affected the extraction , and therefore the taste , of the coffee			0
‘ hard water is generally considered to be bad for coffee , but we found it was the type of hardness that mattered - while high bicarbonate levels are bad , high magnesium ion levels increase the extraction of coffee into water and improve the taste , ’ mr @entity30 said .			2

water composition makes a ‘ dramatic difference ’ to coffee from same bean
softened water does not a good cup of coffee make
