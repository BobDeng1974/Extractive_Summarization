the @entity0 is the unlucky recipient of a booby prize for its baffling use of ' gobbledygook ' at an awards ceremony			1
the weather service has been singled out during the @entity7 for its jargon - filled description of a new style of weather forecast it introduced in november			1
the @entity0 said the forecast aims to ' empower people to make their own decisions ' by using the ' probabilities of precipitation '			1
confusing ? the new @entity18 - style system gives the percentage chances of precipitation , rather than telling people that rain will be ' likely ' or ' very likely ' the new @entity18 - style system gives the percentage chances of precipitation , rather than telling people that rain will be ' likely ' or ' very likely '			1
the awards are organised by the @entity7 , a pressure group based in @entity24 which aims to persuade many @entity26 and worldwide organisations to communicate with the public in plain language			2
it fights bureaucratic language , small print and the legalese of official information			2
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' the word precipitation has a specific meaning and by using it we are helping the nation to learn useful weather terms in a subject we talk about every day			1
' precipitation covers a wide range of stuff falling from the sky including rain , sleet , snow , hail , drizzle and even cats and dogs - but sums it up in just one word			2
' among other winners of the infamous @entity55 booby prize is the @entity56 , which says on its website it ' will innovate to ensure that we are successful on the piste '			0

the ceremony , which coincides with @entity77 , is held at the @entity78 , @entity79 , and features guest speaker @entity80 , a comedian from the city			0
@entity82 , founder of the @entity7 , said : ' i wanted the campaign to give people the confidence to push back on the growing mountain of confusion and meaningless language in public information			0
' the success of the campaign can be seen in the clearer information provided by many organisations over the years			0
' but even though most people agree that plain @entity98 is plain common sense , our government needs to make it a legal duty that public communications are crystal - clear			0
' several organisations were being presented with awards for their use of clear and concise @entity98			0
@entity107 's @entity106 blog ( @entity108 / ) and the website of @entity111 's @entity110 ( www.jostrust.org.uk ) - an organisation which supports women affected by cervical cancer - have been singled out for their jargon - free information .			0
