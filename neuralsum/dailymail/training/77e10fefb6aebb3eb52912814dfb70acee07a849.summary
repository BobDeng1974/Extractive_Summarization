arms laden with parcels , the excited guests step into the opulent hotel reception before being whisked to a ' gift room '			2
as the door swings open they are greeted by a sea of exquisitely wrapped presents and instructed to leave theirs inside			2
next they are ushered to a waiting area and served miniature bottles of vintage champagne			2
later they will feast at beautifully decorated tables , rounding off the meal with a slice cut from a towering , five - tiered cake			2
it sounds like the kind of party organised by a wealthy celebrity but hostess @entity23 , 31 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , is not famous			2
and although the cash lavished on the occasion would pay for a traditional wedding reception , in fact her guests are celebrating the imminent arrival of a baby			1
@entity23 , a trainee photographer and now mum to @entity37 , nine months , began planning hers as soon as she found she was pregnant			2
' the plan was for it to be grand , girly and very special , ' she says			2
' i love entertaining , so this gave me an excuse to really push the boat out			2
' when baby showers first caught on here , they were low - key affairs for a few close girlfriends at their pregnant friend 's home			1
now the shower has become a costly social event : a recent study found that women in @entity49 spend £ 220 million attending baby showers each year			1
no wonder dozens of companies now offer baby shower gift - lists online , and there are even professional baby shower planners			1
there was certainly no expense spared at @entity23 's party , generously funded by her stock trader boyfriend @entity82 , 33			1
' i 'm @entity85 - obsessed , ' says @entity23 , ' so when i found out i was having a girl i spent hours thinking of ways to incorporate the style of individual @entity85 princesses into each table			2
' we ’re worth it : @entity93 , pictured with her daughter @entity94 , wanted a baby shower that was ' glamorous , fancy and memorable ' generous : some of the gifts from @entity93 's baby shower including a designer baby changing bag @entity23 hired a professional event organiser and together they chose the venue — an 18th - century hotel costing £ 1,500 — selected the £ 500 floral arrangements and commissioned a five - tiered @entity106 biscuit - flavoured cake , which set @entity23 back £ 1,300			1
extras , including bespoke invitations , a photo booth where guests could take souvenir pictures , professional photography , and initialled wooden baby block favours for the 50 guests , led to an eye - watering final bill of £ 10,000			1
yet @entity23 , who was seven months pregnant at the party , insists it was worth it			2
' every single guest was gobsmacked , ' she says			2
' it was surprise after surprise			0
it definitely had the wow factor and seeing everyone 's reactions made me so proud			1
' increasingly , baby showers seem to be taking the place of weddings for unmarried expectant women			1
@entity134 , a 31 - year - old @entity135 manager who is not married to her partner @entity136 , 32 , admits that , in the absence of a wedding , it was an excuse for a party			1
' so many of my friends got married and had big dos , and i felt i was missing out , ' she says			0
' i convinced @entity136 that i deserved a special party but thankfully he has no idea how much i spent			0
' growing trend : baby showers started in @entity53 and are becoming increasingly popular in @entity49 @entity134 toured @entity150 's finest afternoon tea venues , including five - star hotels the @entity152 and @entity153 , before eventually opting for a quirky vintage tearoom in @entity150			1
a menu of finger sandwiches , cupcakes and scones , along with table flowers , bespoke bunting and vintage china , set her back just shy of £ 1,000			1
extras pushed the final bill to more than £ 1,500			1
' at the time it did n't feel over-the - top , ' says @entity134 , now mum to @entity166 , five months			0
' i kept reminding myself that i deserved it , that my baby girl deserved it			1
plus , i wanted to spoil my girlfriends and my family			0
what better excuse than being pregnant ? ' her guests bought gifts from a wish - list she compiled at @entity179			0
' i got everything i asked for , including a @entity182 basket , a baby walker and a high chair , ' @entity134 says			1
in the end she received more than £ 2,000 worth of gifts this may sound lavish and materialistic but it is not unusual			1
a recent study revealed that one woman in eight splurges £ 100 before attending a baby shower , so an invitation certainly does n't guarantee a cheap day out			1
@entity93 , 36 , from @entity194 , @entity150 , copied a celebrity when she began organising her baby shower last year			1
after reading about the star - studded event that @entity200 actress @entity199 arranged for her sister , the accountant resolved to give herself the same vip treatment when she became pregnant			0
' i wanted an event that was glamorous , fancy and memorable , ' says the married mum of 18 - month - old @entity94			0
splashing out : @entity134 admitted expecting her daughter @entity166 was an excuse for a party so she spent thousands on a baby shower and received expensive presents after setting up a gift list having saved £ 10,000 , she could afford to think big — and she had a specific theme in mind			1
' gold is my favourite thing , ' she says			0
' that was the look i wanted for my classy , @entity219 - themed party			0
when i was four months pregnant and visited @entity220 and saw its enormous gold - framed pictures , i knew it was the venue for me			0
' first she hired an event planner			0
after drawing up a 40 - strong all - female guest list , the pair worked together to choose floral arrangements , decide on the menu and order generous party bags containing home - made jam , lollypop - shaped cakes and pink sweets			0
the event organiser charged £ 2,500 , which included finishing touches such as flowers			1
' @entity240 afternoon tea at the golf club was £ 1,500 for 40 of us , ' says @entity93 , ' and when you factor in extras like a professional photographer and formal , gold - printed invitations , the whole event cost around £ 5,000			1
' luckily , @entity93 's husband @entity248 , 36 , laughed off his wife 's excesses when he discovered the cost			1
' a few friends commented that i 'd gone way over the top , ' @entity93 says			0
' one actually said the do was ridiculous and that never in a million years would she have spent that much			0
but no one could deny it was a beautiful event			0
' it 's raining gifts : one woman in eight splurges £ 100 before attending a baby shower ( posed by models ) certainly the baby shower , held when @entity93 was six months pregnant , made her the centre of attention			1
from the moment she arrived at the 18th - century manor house last february , she was given the red - carpet treatment			1
after sinking her stilettos into the plush crimson walkway that had been unfurled to meet her at the car door , she had her hair styled and posed for professional photographs			0
in the vast function room she was greeted by a mountain of perfectly wrapped gifts			0
she did n't have time to unwrap them before she was enjoying a luxury afternoon tea with lashings of pink lemonade and , after that , party games			0
later in the afternoon @entity93 sat down in front of her guests and , one by one over the course of an hour , opened the presents they 'd brought			0
' it was such a lovely experience and the gifts just kept coming , ' she says			0
' i got a @entity294 changing bag , a high chair , @entity297 baby clothes and even two pairs of tiny @entity300 boots			1
' my guests had ordered online using a maternity concierge company , and the staff had wrapped the gifts and delivered them to the venue			0
so it was lovely for everyone to be able to see what they 'd bought me			0
i was given so much — at least £ 1,000 worth			2
' with hindsight , does @entity93 feels she might have gone a touch overboard ? ' not at all , ' she says resolutely			0
' i had an unforgettable , amazing day that people still talk about			0
why not spoil yourself ? i have absolutely no regrets			0
