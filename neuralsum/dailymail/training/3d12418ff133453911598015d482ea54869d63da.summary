all of the designs were scrapped for being ' too ahead of their time ' , too expensive or too complicated a graveyard of previously unseen @entity5 - style inventions , designed by @entity7 engineers in the 1960s , has been brought to life as sketches and animations by a @entity7 defence firm			1
the forgotten designs were unearthed in @entity15 ' archives and include a hypersonic space - plane capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound , a jeep that leaps over enemy blockades and a commercial aircraft able to take off and land vertically from city centres			1
all of the designs were scrapped for being ' too ahead of their time ' , too expensive or too complicated			1
it would have been powered by 12 vertical lift fans attached to the side of a 4x4 transporter			1
the angle of the fans could be adjusted dependent on the situation this concept design taken from @entity40 's archives is of a fighter jet take - off platform			1
if developed it would have been a platform that rose vertically from the ground with an aircraft attached to its back			2
the attached jet could then take off without the need of a runway a @entity50 - based firm recently unveiled plans for a flying car that is small enough to fit in a garage , and does n't need a runway to take off			1
the @entity55 can take off from a vertical position because of motorised rotors on the wings			0
these rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors			0
being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways , car parks and even when stuck in traffic			0
although you will still need at least 100 feet in diameter in order to open the wings			0
according to designers @entity74 , the vehicle will carry four people ' in car - like comfort '			0
it is expected to be able to fly , nonstop , for 500 miles			0
@entity15 has used animation to show how the projects might have looked if developed further , with many worthy of a place in the fleet of @entity84 in the @entity84 science fiction series of the era			2
the display coincides with the opening of a new centre to celebrate @entity15 's heritage at its military aircraft factory in @entity92 , @entity93			1
it has more than one million historical documents and artefacts in its stores			0
the unique designs were produced by engineers in @entity15 ' predecessor companies including @entity102 , @entity103 and the @entity104			2
@entity15 's heritage manager @entity106 said : ' although 50 years have passed since these extraordinary designs were first put to paper , we can see how some of the technologies and ideas were developed over time and put to use now in aircraft like the @entity114			1
' mr @entity106 hopes the examples of forward thinking will still inspire young people who are considering a career in engineering and considering the ' endless possibilities ' of what could be designed			0
among the shelved designs uncovered by @entity15 was the hypersonic aircraft			1
in 1964 , the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) designed a hypersonic aircraft capable of flight at five times the speed of sound			2
it was nicknamed mustard ( @entity128 )			0
the @entity129 ) would have been the world 's first reusable ' space plane '			2
the designs showed the plane would have been made of three separate crewed , delta - winged sections that were launched as a single unit the project would have created the world 's first reusable ' space plane ' , with the cost of development having been estimated as ' 20 to 30 times cheaper ' than the expendable rocket systems which eventually put man on the moon five years later in 1969			1
the aircraft was made of three separate crewed , delta - winged sections that are launched as a single unit			2
two of those would act as boosters and launch the third into space			0
they would then separate before returning to @entity150 like normal aircraft , followed by the third once its intended mission was complete			0
the government decided not to proceed with the project though , prompting @entity156 - one of the developers - to comment that @entity128 was too ' far ahead of its time ' , and that there was ' nothing worse than being right at the wrong time '			2
an artist 's impression of what he mustard space plane 's three delta - winged sections would have looked like after launch			1
two of the sections would act as boosters and launch the third into space			0
they would then separate before returning to @entity150 once its intended mission was complete the costs of the mustard project were estimated as ' 20 to 30 times cheaper ' than the expendable rocket systems which put man on the moon in 1969			0
the government decided not to proceed with the project though because of budget constraints			0
its developer @entity156 said @entity128 was too ' far ahead of its time ' the ideas behind that original aircraft can still be seen today in current delta - winged space aircraft such as @entity187 's @entity186 , @entity189 's @entity188 as well as early designs for the @entity191			1
the @entity193 vertical - lift aircraft design from the @entity103 company was an attempt to bring vertical take - off and landing ( @entity198 ) to commercial aircraft			2
it would have allowed airlines to put airports in densely - populated cities that would have opened up more direct travel for passengers and cut down on the amount of space required for airport runways			2
a number of designs were drawn up over the 1960s , looking very similar to modern - day passenger planes , each featuring rows of lift fans on either side of the body of the plane			1
this sketch shows the @entity193 vertical - lift aircraft design discovered in @entity15 ' archives			1
it was an attempt to bring vertical take - off and landing ( @entity198 ) to commercial aircraft which would have meant airports could be placed in city centres the @entity193 vertical - lift aircraft design from the @entity103 company was dropped after it was decided that together with the cost of fuel required to fly the aircraft and the extra load from the frames housing the lift fans , combined with the weight of passengers , could lead to instability in flight the project was eventually dropped after it was decided that together with the cost of fuel required to fly the aircraft and the extra load from the frames housing the lift fans , combined with the weight of passengers , could lead to instability in flight			1
@entity198 systems inspired by the project are still in use today however , through the @entity247 , with adaptations of the vertical lift fans having been engineered by @entity15 to improve some of the most versatile military jets in the world			1
the ' @entity26 ' was a concept reconnaissance vehicle that was capable of leaping over obstacles and enemy blockades during battle			2
it would have been powered by 12 vertical lift fans attached to the side of a 4x4 transporter			1
the angle of the fans could be adjusted dependent on the situation			0
the ' @entity263 ' project was developed with the @entity265 's @entity264 but was cancelled in the mid- 1960s due to assessments that production of the design would be too expensive developed by @entity27 at the request of the @entity7 army in the 1960s , the design was an attempt to adapt vertical take - off and landing technology to vehicles and was developed with the @entity265 's @entity276			1
yet the project was cancelled in the mid- 1960s due to assessments that production of the design would be too expensive			0
and the fighter jet take - off platform was a concept platform that would rise vertically from the ground , and make it possible for an aircraft to take - off from its back			1
this would let planes operate from small airstrips or narrow forest clearings			0
@entity102 developed the @entity293 jet and rather than attaching a heavy vertical take - off and landing system to the aircraft , it collaborated with @entity297 - based shorts to create the @entity298 - a platform that would stay steady above the ground and allow the @entity293 to take - off from its surface using 56 jet engines , the @entity298 platform , pictured , gave the @entity293 jet the desired effect of being able to take off from tight spaces such as forest clearings			1
it was not picked for further consideration due to the complexity of its operation and a lack of available budget @entity102 developed the @entity293 jet to fulfil the purpose of a tactical strike and reconnaissance jet			0
rather than attaching a heavy vertical take - off and landing system to the aircraft , though , the company collaborated with @entity297 - based shorts , which created the @entity298 - a platform that would stay steady above the ground and allow the @entity293 to take - off from its surface			2
using 56 jet engines , the @entity298 gave the @entity293 the desired effect of being able to take off from tight spaces			0
on its own , the @entity298 would also have been able to fill the role of a @entity198 freight transport , able to deliver equipment and supplies to less - accessible locations			0
it was not picked for further consideration by the @entity328 at that time due to the complexity of its operation and a lack of available budget .			0

the jeep would have used 12 vertical fans to propel it over enemy blockades
a fighter jet platform could let aircraft launch without a runway
the @entity7 inventions were discovered among unseen archives from @entity7 defence firm @entity15
others included a hypersonic space - plane and city centre airport
all of the designs were scrapped for being ' too ahead of their time ' , too expensive or too complicated
