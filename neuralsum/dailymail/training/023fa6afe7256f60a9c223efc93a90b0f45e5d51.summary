general sir @entity0 , @entity1 , also pays token rent on apartment at @entity4 - at yearly cost of around £ 256,000 to taxpayer by @entity7 and @entity8 published : 19:17 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 06:01 est , 20 june 2013 @entity9 , general sir @entity10 , is paid £ 180,000 and has a flat in @entity12 as his official residence @entity16 ’s military top brass should sacrifice their ‘ lavish lifestyles ’ and move into council flats , a former government economist has said			1
in an attack on the ‘ grotesque ’ culture of grace - and - favour privileges enjoyed by senior officers – including heavily subsidised luxury apartments – the former chief economic adviser to the @entity25 says up to £ 1 billion can be saved			1
this could be done by cutting ‘ questionable ’ allowances to senior officers , axeing up to one in three posts above the rank of brigadier ( or equivalent ) and by procuring new aircraft carriers and submarines more efficiently			0
@entity33 , who retired last year , rubbished suggestions by the head of the @entity36 , general sir @entity10 , that any further cuts to the £ 34billion defence budget would jeopardise @entity16 ’s ability to win wars			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ well , he would say that , would n’t he ? as the head of the @entity36 , general @entity10 is paid £ 180,000 and has a flat as his official residence			1
' this is a lavish lifestyle and it is shared by a number of very senior officers in the @entity47 and the @entity48			0
' senior officers say they require official residences in easy reach of @entity52 so they can be summoned to advise the prime minister at any time			2
' in that case they could be found a council flat in @entity57 – the point being that other properties could fill the same geographic criteria			2
general sir @entity0 , @entity1 , pays a token rent on princess @entity63 's former apartment in @entity4 and can live there with his wife @entity64 ( above ) for the duration of his time in office			1
the property reportedly costs the taxpayer £ 256,000 a year to run favours : general sir @entity0 ( circled left ) and general sir @entity10 ( circled right ) , with the @entity71 and the military top brass at the @entity73 and @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76 , last year ‘ at the same time , many junior ranks ’ accommodation resembles council estates			1
some of these flats and houses are abysmal and the comparison between the treatment of those at the top and bottom ends of the @entity73 is grotesque			0
’ general sir @entity0 , @entity1 , pays a token rent on princess @entity63 ’s former apartment in @entity4 and can live there with his wife @entity64 for the duration of his time in office			1
the property reportedly costs the taxpayer £ 256,000 a year to run			1
the @entity93 , admiral sir @entity94 – the most senior officer in the @entity47 – has a luxury apartment in @entity96 , just off @entity97			1
remarkably , none of these service chiefs is reported to pay more than £ 750 a month to rent these properties , and there are many other such officers in luxury properties			1
they may also claim for domestic assistance and some enjoy the services of personal chefs and drivers			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity110 , mr @entity33 described visiting an eight - bedroom house at the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , which was maintained for entertaining guests by the rear admiral commanding ‘ @entity117 ’ – the @entity117 establishment			1
the @entity93 , admiral sir @entity94 - the most senior officer in the @entity47 - has a luxury apartment in @entity96 , just off @entity97 he said it was fitted out with antiques and grand paintings like a country hotel , all at public expense			1
‘ the rear admiral admitted he and his wife had n’t liked living there so they had moved to a much smaller place nearby , but their huge house was maintained for guests of @entity117 , ’ he said			0
‘ what we have is a relic of the 1920s class system in the @entity73 that is perpetuated through a package of privileges and remuneration to senior officers which they could n’t maintain in civilian life and is denied even to senior officials in the diplomatic service			0
’ mr @entity33 also said many of these officers were doing little more than ‘ manning desks ’ in @entity149 and that one in three could be removed from the command chain without remotely damaging @entity16 ’s chances of winning future wars			1
he said : ‘ all three services are top - heavy with senior officers , even in comparison to the @entity158 military , which is hardly an example of efficiency			2
many are replicating each other ’s jobs			0
‘ we would be better off amalgamating the three services at the level of high - ranking commanders to end this duplication			2
this would mean the @entity73 would n’t need to retain and promote so many officers in order to compete for the top jobs			0
’ the @entity25 's @entity172 , @entity33 , said : ' senior officers say they require official residences in easy reach of @entity52 so they can be summoned to advise the pm at any time			1
in that case they could be found a council flat in @entity57 '			2
above , @entity4 mr @entity33 said politicians and civilian officials were reluctant to challenge the generals and admirals over their packages because they would have to put their own pay deals and perks under similar scrutiny			1
‘ at the end of the last @entity190 government a report was commissioned into these privileges			0
it was intended to highlight the cost of official residences and vehicles and the lifestyles but it was never published and effectively buried , ’ he said			1
on procurement , mr @entity33 suggested the @entity25 was restricted by its relationship with the @entity16 defence industry , with companies such as @entity200 enjoying a ‘ feather - bedded monopoly ’			1
‘ @entity200 won a contract to build the @entity204 attack - class submarines after offering a price that it simply could not afford			2
so it went cap in hand to the @entity25 claiming that it would have to default on the order unless the @entity25 coughed up more money			0
’ an @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ senior ranks do not just fulfil command positions in the three services , they also hold senior management roles			0
as well as positions in @entity16 embassies , @entity217 and other coalition headquarters around the world			0
’ ... as no. 10 goes to war on ' luxury ' @entity36 budget @entity16 can no longer expect to punch ‘ way above its weight ’ on military spending , @entity222 has told defence secretary @entity226			0
the warning comes as the @entity25 fights to avoid deep cuts in this month ’s spending review			0
mr @entity226 has angered @entity230 by refusing to sign up to any reductions that might damage frontline capabilities			0
@entity16 can no longer expect to punch ' way above its weight ' on military spending , @entity222 has told defence secretary @entity226 ( right ) but he has been warned in stark terms by mr @entity222 that the @entity25 ’s £ 34 billion budget should be regarded as generous because it is the fourth largest in the world – even though the @entity16 economy is only sixth			2
the @entity239 , who are sixth in the defence pecking order , spend £ 8 billion less than the @entity16			2
@entity158 accounts for 40 per cent of global defence spending with an annual £ 436 billion budget			2
@entity244 is second , with £ 106 billion , while @entity245 is third on £ 57 billion			2
mr @entity222 said that the chancellor is demanding ‘ just ’ £ 1.6 billion to be trimmed from the @entity25 mr @entity226 responded by saying he would try to find ‘ efficiency savings ’ but would not slash deep into manpower or equipment budgets			0
the exchanges between mr @entity222 and mr @entity226 took place as negotiations continue between the @entity25 and the @entity253 ahead of the spending review on june 26			0
a @entity149 source said : ‘ mr @entity222 is proud of that fact we have such powerful , well - resourced @entity73			0
but he wanted @entity226 to be aware that it is something of a luxury when there is a such a pressing need to trim spending			0
’ the @entity25 has been at the centre of some of the most public , and acrimonious , exchanges about the spending review , with the head of the @entity36 , general sir @entity10 , warning that cuts could endanger soldiers ’ lives			1
sir @entity10 argued it would be dangerous to lose more troops when the @entity36 is already being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel			1
‘ imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies have materialised properly in a balanced way would be very disruptive , ’ he said			0
an earlier version of this article said general sir @entity10 had an apartment at @entity4			1
in fact his @entity36 accommodation in @entity12 is at a different location			1
nor does he have a country residence as was stated			0
we apologise for these inaccuracies .			0
