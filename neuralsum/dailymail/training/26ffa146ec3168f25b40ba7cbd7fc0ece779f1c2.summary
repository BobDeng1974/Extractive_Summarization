they are seeking $ 350 million ( £ 224m ) in damages , which could be tripled if the jury finds @entity2 broke federal anti-trust law			1
@entity2 stopped using the particular software in question in 2009 , which means the lawsuit only covers @entity7 models bought between september 2006 and march 2009			1
