from @entity4 oils to high - tech serums , @entity2 blow dries to @entity7 hair straighteners , i shudder to think how much money i have spent on trying to tame my wild mane over the years			2
left to its own devices , my hair is wild , bushy and as coarse as a @entity12			2
only with handfuls of @entity16 anti- frizz shampoo ( a snip at £ 13 a bottle ) and lashings of super-moisturising conditioner ( which comes in a gold tub and costs almost £ 20 a pop ) does it go some way towards behaving itself			1
then comes the array of argan oils , heat - protecting sprays and serums - each costing between £ 7 and £ 20 - to try to finish the job			1
which is why i was so excited when i heard about the latest bargain that 's now the number one bestselling hair product on @entity48			2
at just £ 7.50 for the shampoo and the conditioner , it 's said to be loved by celebrities such as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
so , what is this wonder product ? horse shampoo			1
yes , you read correctly : actual horse shampoo			1
@entity34 was originally created for show ponies to keep their manes and tails shiny and glossy			1
the results were so good that , soon , the horses ' owners started to use the products on their own hair - and then word spread			1
according to the makers , their shampoo and conditioner ' have been a best - kept secret for beauty aficionados everywhere '			1
the shampoo is ' fortified with moisturisers and emollients to help leave hair soft and ultra-clean ' , while the conditioner ' helps nourish and aid healthy hair growth , leaving hair looking lustrous and silky '			1
mixed reviews : the two products cost £ 7.50 but it seems you 'll either love them or hate them together , ' these micro-enriched protein formulas help to prevent hair breakage and repair split ends , achieving the goal of longer , stronger , fuller hair			1
the results are unbelievable ! ' blimey			2
can this really be true ? i quickly get online to @entity48 to order it and find out for myself			2
the next day , it arrives			2
the packaging is not exactly a glamorous addition to my bathroom - the big , white , plastic bottles have a picture of , well , a horse on them , which looks as though it 's running into a yellow sunset			2
if @entity109 were to buy beauty products from @entity48 , it would be this duo			0
still , i 'm hopeful			0
given that horses ' hair is dry , frizzy and three times thicker than human hair , i figure this stuff has got to be able to whip even my mop into shape			1
the shampoo is reassuringly thick and creamy , but it does n't smell like normal shampoo			1
i try to put my finger on what it is like and can come up with only one thing : carpet cleaner			0
no horsing around : @entity34 left @entity32 's hair dry and tangled @entity32 will stick to her old shampoo , left , as the horse shampoo made her feel ' like an old nag '			1
her hair is much frizzier , right , after using @entity38 the shampoo lathers well but , after rinsing , my hair feels much drier than it usually does			1
i apply lashings of the equally - thick conditioner , which looks creamy , but feels quite watery compared with my usual conditioner			1
my hair soaks it all up but , again , after rinsing , it feels dry and brittle			0
things take a turn for the worse when i put my mop under the hairdryer - my hair feels like straw and looks as frazzled as if i 'd put my hands into an electric socket			0
it 's become so knotted and tangled at the ends , i even struggle to get my brush through it			0
i have n't experienced anything like this since i was a child			0
so much for show pony - i feel more like an old nag			2
i ca n't understand the rave reviews			0
i did more hunting in the @entity48 reader comments and found that , underneath the dozens of five - star reviews , there were a few like me , who found their hair became dry and matted after use			0
this seems to be the @entity164 of hair products - you either love it or hate it			0
one user said it took a while for her hair to get used to the products , so i persisted for a week			0
after two further washes , my hair did adjust slightly			0
it did n't feel quite so dry , and it did feel like it cleaned my scalp well			0
the tangles , however , remained			0
so , there 'll be no more horsing around for me			0
i will return to my usual , reassuringly expensive hair products - and maybe have a flutter on the gee - gees to help pay for them .			0
