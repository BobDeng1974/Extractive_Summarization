directory : @entity2 's controversial book lists the contact details , specialisms , working hours and charging policies of almost 600 sex workers in the capital a book entitled ' a guide to the @entity10 ' was at the centre of a police prostitution probe today after selling 500 copies on @entity14			1
police officers have been asked to investigate the new directory which ranks prostitutes on a five - star scale			2
the book lists the contact details , specialisms , working hours and charging policies of almost 600 sex workers in the capital			1
the £ 10 directory has sold more than 500 copies , according to author @entity2 , 63 , a retired vinyl record seller and veteran reviewer of sexual services			2
however , @entity30 , deputy mayor of london with responsibility for policing , said he would ask the @entity33 to investigate the legality of the book			1
he said : ' it strikes me that reviewing human beings in the same way as a restaurants is repellent			0
' the thing people forget is that the world of organised prostitution is also a world of organised crime , drug dealing and abuse			1
anything like this that tries to sanitise it is revolting			0
' mr @entity2 , who has also written a book called guide to the agencies , @entity52 of @entity53 , said he took all the measures he could to ensure those listed work of their own free will , and had no moral qualms about his work			1
he said : ' i think we have far too many people in this world telling us how to behave			1
' obviously we want to give a good example to the youth of the country , but you should be free to do what we want as long as it ’s not going to harm anyone else			0
' he said he ’d sold copies to ' gentlemen , including viscounts and knights of the realm , ' and police would be wasting their time if they investigated			2
police probe : the new directory by @entity2 , pictured , ranks prostitutes on a five - star scale he said : ' there have been far more blatant cases that have been taken to court and people were found not guilty			1
' i ’m not saying it ’s legal , but all sorts of things are illegal			0
it ’s a question of whether it ’s in the public interest to take me to court			0
' a @entity33 spokesman said they would consider investigating when they received information from mr @entity30			0
mass market : the book which police are being asked to investigate is currently for sale on @entity14 a spokesman said : ' the @entity33 ’s human exploitation and organised crime command responds to , and builds up , intelligence pictures in areas of the sex industry where the most harm may be done			1
' our primary aim is to make @entity53 a hostile environment for traffickers and those who exploit people to operate in			1
' mr @entity2 used personal experience , newspaper adverts and the internet in his attempt to research and rank every individual working lady in @entity53			1
detailed : a page from ' a guide to the @entity10 of @entity53 ' which highlights the work of a woman in @entity126 he edits four specific guidebooks , @entity2 ’s @entity129 , @entity2 ’s @entity130 , @entity131 to @entity132 in @entity53 and @entity131 to @entity132 in @entity133 , the @entity134 and @entity135			1
based on his @entity2 ’s scoring system , @entity137 ’s workers scored highest with an average of 4.5 stars			2
the working ladies of @entity142 received an average 3.4 stars , those in @entity145 were rated at three stars , and @entity148 ’s working women were given 2.7 stars			2
he described nearby @entity151 as boasting ' a number of working ladies , although none are of any note '			2
not happy : @entity30 , deputy mayor of london with responsibility for policing , said he would ask the @entity33 to investigate the legality of @entity2 's book one former prostitute , listed in the guide despite starting a new career , said she fell into the role through friends , and had no regrets about a job she enjoyed			1
she said : ' i suppose [ the book ] is handy if you are a guy who wants this kind of service			2
it ’s good it has people ’s real opinions rather than what the people who do it themselves say			0
it ’s good to have an honest opinion			0
' the guide to the @entity184 , @entity185 of @entity53 gives a similar star rating to dominatrixes and ' masseurs '			1
despite the police being asked to look at @entity183 to the @entity191 , it is unlikely that any prosecution would be brought against its author			1
the police may , however , be interested in offences connected with advertising on behalf of prostitutes			0
such offences may include conspiracy to @entity200 or to @entity201			0
but as author @entity2 is merely providing a guidebook and not working with or making money from the women he promotes , the police may have difficulties in bringing a charge			1
even if the police passed a file to the @entity211 , it would have to consider whether a prosecution would be in the public interest			0
@entity215 courts also take @entity216 - @entity217 - very seriously			0
free expression can not be curtailed simply because a publication might offend			0
the question of whether a publication outrages public decency is one for a jury and the threshold for guilt is very high			0
mr @entity2 has four other guidebooks out concerning adult services and has never been prosecuted			0
that more than anything shows that a police charge against mr @entity2 is unlikely to happen .			0
