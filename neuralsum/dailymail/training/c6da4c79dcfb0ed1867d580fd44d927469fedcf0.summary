by @entity0 @entity1 now stock £ 12.99 @entity3 wine			1
the @entity5 grape variety was only recognised by the @entity6 in 2010 merlot goes with beef , sauvignon blanc with chicken … but when you dine on sushi it is not so easy to find the perfect wine accompaniment			1
however , @entity1 is offering the solution by becoming the first high street retailer to stock @entity18 wine			2
the specialist white @entity3 wine , pictured left , is taken from large white @entity22 grapes nurtured in volcanic soil at the foot of @entity25			1
there , the grapes are given small umbrellas to shade them from the intense sunshine			2
@entity3 has been grown to be eaten as a fresh table grape in @entity31 for a thousand years but only in the last 100 years has it been made into wine			1
it is new to the @entity6 as it was only officially recognised as a wine grape in 2010			2
@entity5 varieties are rarely seen on wine lists but occasionally they can be found in @entity18 restaurants for around £ 60 per bottle			1
so if you are seeking a taste of the exotic without the high price tag , the £ 12.99 @entity3 may come as a relief			1
it is currently being trialled in 70 stores and if successful will be rolled out nationwide			0
it will also be available online in the coming weeks			0
@entity1 wine buyer @entity49 decided to list the wine after the success of the @entity54 wine range , which was introduced in 2012			2
she said : ‘ we are excited to bring such a rare and previously specialist wine to a wider public			2
until now , @entity18 wine has not been something you would expect to find on the high street			0
' the dazzling lemongrass flavours match brilliantly with sushi and @entity18 food			1
’ @entity66 wine reviewer @entity65 tried out the @entity3			0
she said : ‘ i know the old adage about books and covers but let ’s start with the label			0
it ’s rather lovely , actually			0
‘ the wine is called @entity3 ( meaning “ the sun shines ” ) and it is made from the thick - skinned , white @entity5 grape grown in vineyards in the @entity78 region on the main island of @entity80			1
' the weather is extreme ( to put it mildly ) so making good wine in @entity31 is not easy			1
but i tip my hat to the @entity1 winemaker , who has sniffed out a gem here			0
the £ 12.99 bottle of wine is made from @entity5 grapes which are grown at the foot of @entity25 ‘ on sticking my nose in the glass , having given it a good swirl , there is a gentle hug of lemon			1
and the taste ? ' @entity100 , refreshingly light ( it is just 11.5 per cent abv ) with more citrus fruit flavours and a bit of apple too			0
' it is not unlike @entity107 , but with a splash of added interest because of where it comes from			0
‘ the label tells me it will go with sushi and tempura and i can see why it would work , given the delicate flavours and freshness of the wine			2
' but my glass was quite happy with a bowl of lightly salted crisps			0
just make sure it is really nicely chilled , even if the sun is n’t shining			0

@entity22 grapes used to make wine are grown at the base of @entity25
they have been eaten in @entity31 for years but only recently made into *alcohol*
the £ 12.99 bottle has hints of lemongrass and goes best with sushi
