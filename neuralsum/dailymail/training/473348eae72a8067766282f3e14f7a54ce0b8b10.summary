never before has our world been so connected or convenient			1
with the click of a button we can change the channel , drop the heat or book a trip to @entity7			0
our food is grown , produced and plated - up to our exact liking			2
drive - thrus , home deliveries , medical advances and the right to education			2
in a short space of time , life has transformed to one of convenience			0
so why are we so stressed , overweight and dreaming of being free ? have we forgotten something our ancestors knew ? @entity23 's @entity22 tribe is the closest we 'll get to looking into that past			1
on the banks of @entity28 's @entity27 , in the north of the country , lives the world 's last hunter - gatherer tribe			1
they do n't grow food , raise livestock or build permanent shelter			0
instead they live a life unchanged for more than 10 - thousand years			1
their world is one of ultimate freedom - something modern society can barely imagine and is unlikely to ever experience			1
let alone have the skills in which to stay alive			0
text messages and phone calls do n't exist			0
no jobs , bosses , timetables , social or religious structures			0
no laws , taxes and incredibly , no money - the closest thing to currency is the occasional trade for a pair of shorts or sandals with a neighbouring tribe			1
we spent our time with the @entity65 hunting baboon , a daily activity for the men , in what is a hot , harsh climate			0
their landscape is precariously packed with thorny bushes , poisonous snakes and man - eating lions			2
but a successful hunting expedition is the difference between eating or going hungry			0
just south of here some of the oldest fossil evidence of early @entity94 were discovered			2
by all modern standards , the @entity22 should n't really exist			1
a tribe time has forgotten			2
they do not engage in conflict , and have no memory of infectious outbreaks or starvation			0
their population never exceeds numbers that can not be sustained through hunting or gathering			2
the @entity22 diet is simple			1
meat - including birds , baboons , antelope and buffalo - killed by hand - made bows and arrows , crafted in - between hunting trips			1
their language is believed to be the oldest still - spoken language known to man ... a rhythmic dialect punctuated by clicking sounds			1
unlike the modern - day office dweller , the @entity22 enjoys an extraordinary amount of leisure time			1
their ' work ' - hunting for food - take up around five hours of their day			2
and over all these thousands of years , they 've left little more than a footprint on their land			0
the @entity22 represents a part of the world 's cultural make - up , which has all but gone			1
but the greatest tragedy is they may also represent what we 've all lost			0
the @entity22 show us how to track animals , from baboon to snakes to lions , but we have to run to keep up - they do n't pander to westerners one bit the @entity22 are hugely skilled with their handmade bow and arrow - we have a go and barely get the arrow to go three feet in front of us in the morning the boys and men gather in a circle to sharpen their homemade spears and smoke tobacco through a pipe - this is the most social part of their day hunters head out wearing baboon skin wraps - they must earn the right to wear these by proving themselves to be a capable hunter ; and a baboon skull @entity167 and @entity168 are @entity171 - based @entity170 journalists , who took a year 's leave to learn more about the world			1
they wandered through @entity23 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity28 , and lived with some of the world 's most remote and endangered tribes			1
their journey has been captured through photos , movies and interviews			0
through their @entity187 the couple sell prints from their journeys , with profits going back to the @entity191 people who touched their hearts			0
their book , ' tribe : life on the @entity198 story of beauty and survival ' , is also available .			0
