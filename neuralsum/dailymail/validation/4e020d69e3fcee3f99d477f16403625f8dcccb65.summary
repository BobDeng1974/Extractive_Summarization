the tennis star and fiancée @entity8 will tie the knot at @entity10 and not , as anticipated , in the tiny chapel at his @entity12 , near the @entity14 town where he grew up			1
for the 27 - year - old ’s many fans and friends in the town , it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport , played out on the streets of the community			1
for many , the decision to hold the service in the cathedral will have added poignancy			2
now @entity45 ’s most famous son will marry there – 19 years after he hid under the headteacher ’s desk until the shooting stopped			1
it is understood local residents and businesses urged the former @entity54 champion to hold the april 11 service at the cathedral rather than at @entity12 in nearby @entity57 – so they too could toast his big day			1
the 300 - seat , 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at @entity12 , which seats only 28			1

i ’m sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day			2
’ the cathedral ’s minister , the @entity74 , said : ‘ i ca n’t confirm anything as we have a strict rule that we can not discuss anyone ’s wedding			2
‘ wherever the wedding will be , there is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for @entity4 in @entity45 and a great deal of pride in him			1
i think people are genuinely very pleased for him			0
’ @entity91 and new : @entity4 will get married to @entity8 at @entity10 ( left ) rather than the small chapel attached to @entity12 ( right ) where the reception is still expected to be held the couple announced their engagement in november after nine years together			1
they had been expected to wed at the 15 - bedroom @entity12 , which he bought for £ 1.8million in 2013			1
but it will still host family and friends before and after the service			2
@entity4 ’s schoolfriend @entity103 , 28 , said : ‘ it ’s great			0
there will be loads of people in the streets			0
it will be like a @entity111 version of the royal wedding			1
