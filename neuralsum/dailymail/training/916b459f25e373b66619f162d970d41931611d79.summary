the @entity21 connects drivers to their cars and provides data on both the car and its driver 's performance			1
the company claims its product , which was unveiled at the @entity35 , is the first smartwatch to connect a driver with a car the @entity21 smartwatch monitors the car 's efficiency , including the average speed and fuel consumption it can access vehicle telematics and performance data , such as how smoothly a driver brakes and accelerates			1
the smartwatch also tracks a driver 's heart rate with the help of a heart rate monitor			1
this could be the first step in creating an accessory for drivers that in the future could detect the first signs of fatigue to prevent accidents			0
