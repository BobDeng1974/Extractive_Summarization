it ’s been just over three years since @entity1 was set alight at her @entity3 home , resulting in horrific third degree burns to more than 60 per cent of her body and countless operations to reconstruct her scorched face , arms and torso			1
now the woman who turned her into a ' human fireball ' , leaving her unable to make simple movements such as straightening her elbows due to the agonising scarring , will argue her 17 - year jail sentence was too severe			1
lawyers for @entity19 will on tuesday , in the @entity17 , claim that ms @entity1 was not as badly injured as she stated in court , based on footage that shows her recovery filmed for @entity24 's sunday night program			1
@entity19 , who believed her former husband was involved with ms @entity1 and was envious of her beauty , vowed to ruin her ‘ pretty little face ’			1
she walked into ms @entity1 ’s home on february 16 , 2012 , and hurled a bottle of methylated spirits over her setting her ablaze and changing the 29 - year - old ’s life in every way imaginable			1
‘ i lost my enter life , i know that sounds huge but people do n’t understand the enormity of not having my functionality , it ’s my independence , my sexuality , my everything , ' ms @entity1 told @entity41			1
using skin taken from her legs , doctors have reconstructed the 29 - year - old 's scorched skin over countless operations during the past three years			2
ms @entity1 has many more operations to come and still suffers greatly with functionality during @entity19 ’s original trial , in @entity56 ’s @entity55 , ms @entity1 described how she ' was pretty much instantly on fire ' during the attack			1
as she continues her long and painful recovery , spending most days in hospital and working with domestic violence and suicide prevention charities in her spare time , the dark prospect that @entity19 could be freed early looms			2
‘ i ’ve been given a life sentence and she ’s complaining about 17 years , ’ ms @entity1 said			1
she found out a year ago that @entity19 was lodging an appeal to argue her sentence for grievous bodily harm with intent was ‘ manifestly excessive ’			1
‘ my understanding is she thinks it ’s a sentence too long for what she has done			0
it ’s just annoying i just want to move on and she ’s already caused me enough pain , leave me alone , ’ ms @entity1 said			1
' i am accepting i ’m always going to have scars , which is a necessity to move on ' : almost three years on since her horrific attack , ms @entity1 spends most of her days in hospital still but is also working with charities lawyers for @entity19 ( left and right ) will on tuesday claim that ms @entity1 was not as badly injured as she stated in court			1
they are appealing for her sentence to be reduced she has ‘ no idea ’ if her attacker ’s appeal will be successful however , as ‘ it ’s such a unique case , it ’s unprecedented , ’ ms @entity1 explained			1
since the assault when she was 25 - years - old , ms @entity1 spent two years and eight months wearing a compression mask to help put her face back together			1
‘ it made me feel like nothing of me was @entity1 , not the life i lived , the things i did and not the exterior			2
‘ i would have rather endured physical pain than wear that mask , ’ ms @entity1 said			1
‘ it helped to shape the face and the pressure was so tight it helped flatten and massage the face and try to keep it from going inside out			0
’ the mask has now been removed but every morning when she wakes up she is stiff from her scars			0
‘ i am still in the early stages of recovery , i ’m looking at least five years , ’ she said			0
ms @entity1 spent two years and eight months wearing a compression mask to help put her face back together ' i would have rather endured physical pain than wear that mask ' : ms @entity1 said as she looked back on the past three years since the heinous crime ‘ physically i am accepting i ’m always going to have scars , which is a necessity to move on			1
yes i do n’t look like anyone else but i ’m damn proud about how far i ’ve come and i ’m as unique inside as i am outside			0
’ the @entity3 woman puts much of her progress down to her personality			0
‘ i was always strong			0
that is peoples ’ biggest misconception about me			0
my looks were a bonus , i was strong in my heart and head before this … you ’ve got to love who you are as a person because looks fade , ’ ms @entity1 explained			1
however , she has countless more operations to come , with functionality prioritised over cosmetic procedures			2
@entity1 leaves court after watching the woman who set her alight and left her to burn to death jailed by a @entity3 judge for 17 years ms @entity1 , seen here before the attack with her sister , was set alight by a jealous estranged wife of a man she had met once ‘ i ’m a modern day @entity143 … it ’s absolutely amazing ' : @entity1 pictured here before the attack ‘ i ’ve still got so much to work on			1
i ca n’t really bend my elbows or raise my arms			2
' i ’m stuck if i try to overstretch , i get a break down or wound because my skin is splitting , ’ she explained			0
she spent @entity151 and @entity152 in hospital having her new chest , shoulders and décolletage area operated on			0
‘ it failed the first time so i had to get it redone and it ’s starting to scar again			0
they ’ve taken skin from my right leg five times and my left leg four times , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m a modern day @entity143 … it ’s absolutely amazing and the human body is beyond incredible			0
i am so eternally grateful for the doctors and physios at @entity3 , ’ ms @entity1 added			1
it would be very easy for ms @entity1 to be filled with hate about what happened to her but she insists ‘ all i ever do is take positives ’ from the situation			2
‘ i want my life back			0
i ’m so grateful i ’m alive , i can see , i can smell , i can touch			0
' i want my life back			0
i ’m so grateful i ’m alive ' : today ms @entity1 is looking at the positives to move forward ‘ i guess every day is a reminder but i try not to think that she did this me			2
i want to give it no power			0
i just have heartache and one step forward is ten steps backwards with the burns			0
‘ i ’m used to disappointment now but i ’m also used to getting back up and kicking it in the face , ’ ms @entity1 said			2
as ms @entity1 continues on her recovery she is now working with the @entity191 suicide prevention charity , is an ambassador for the @entity194 campaign and is also representing @entity195 in the 2015 @entity197 fun run as their official charity ambassador			2
‘ i try to get behind most charities but i guess with violence against women and the run it is all about a lifeline for healthy mind and healthy body , that 's something i 've experienced first hand through my recovery , ' she said			0
