with his short - lived dalliances with women and the fact that he spends most of his time with a muscular male sidekick , @entity5 writes that he was in fact in a relationship with @entity13			1
speculation over @entity3 's sexuality has been rife among comic book fans for decades and in @entity17 , @entity5 writes about batman 's penchant for one night stands and ' extreme ' sex after the spark between the couple dwindles			1
extreme : the @entity27 author 's book imagines @entity3 as an ageing homosexual ' @entity3 has always had a very dark side , ' mr @entity5 told @entity30			1
' and it should n't be a shock that my version of this character indulges in weird forms of fetishism and extreme sex			0
the author , who said narcissism was @entity3 's ' inner abyss ' , added : ' he let his only real love story miserably fail because he is in love with the mystery of youth - that inaccessible fleeting kind of spirit that he sees in the eyes of his young male and female pick - ups			1
' the book also explores the personal lives of @entity3 's @entity54 colleagues @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 in @entity58 in the early 21st century			1
the author said he had no intention of offending anybody with his portrayal of @entity3 in his book , which has been well - received by critics			1

ever since @entity3 first began fighting crime on the mean streets of @entity91 with @entity13 at his side , specualation has raged over the caped crusader 's sexuality			2
after the original dark @entity3 stories came a softer , friendlier style in the late 1940s and early 1950s , which was deemed ' camp ' by some observers			2
various commentators have referred to the ' subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature @entity3 and his young friend @entity13 ' , and called the 1960s television series a ' touchstone of camp '			2
opinions differ among writers who have penned @entity3 stories for @entity54 , with @entity110 stating : ' the @entity3 i wrote for 13 years is n't gay '			0
