@entity6 was hit by a taxi in @entity8 just two days before her break was due to end			1
the 18 - year - old 's injuries were so bad that doctors did n't expect her to last the night			1

@entity6 , 22 , was left for dead following a hit and run four years ago			1

she has also reached other recovery milestones such as dressing herself and cleaning her own teeth			0
her mother @entity20 , 56 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , said : ' @entity6 is truly an inspiration			2
from where she was four years ago , she is defying the doctors every step of the way - she 's amazing			2
' until now we did n't want to say anything , but @entity6 wants everyone to know how well she is doing in the hope it will inspire others , who have also suffered traumatic injuries , in their recovery			1

@entity20 said : ' they managed to get to the hospital quickly , as they were only 40 minutes away			0
' it was really hard for me , being here at home , trying to find out what was happening because of the language barrier , but as soon as i could , i flew out there to be by her bedside			0
' it was a shock when i saw her , i can only describe her as being smashed beyond recognition			0
' my son had said the doctors were n't going to put her on a life support machine as they classed her as brain dead , her eyes were fixed and she was classed as being in a coma			1
' but then my son said he saw her arm move and they put her on the machine - they did n't know if she would last the night			1
