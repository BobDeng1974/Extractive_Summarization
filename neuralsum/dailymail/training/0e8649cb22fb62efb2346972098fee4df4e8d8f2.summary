by dr @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 17:03 est , 5 january 2013 as a doctor – and also a parent – i was deeply concerned by the controversial case of @entity7 , the seven - year - old whose mother @entity3 refused to allow him to have radiotherapy for his brain tumour			1
the hospital caring for @entity7 sought legal backing to give him the treatment against her wishes , and last month the @entity15 ruled that six weeks of radiotherapy should start early this month , followed by 18 months of chemotherapy			1
despite compelling evidence that the alternative approaches she found via the internet were unlikely to work , ms @entity18 remains defiant			1
yet i strongly believe the correct decision was made			2
@entity24 is now more likely to survive the cancer			1
dilemma : @entity18 with her cancer - stricken son @entity7 the case has highlighted many misconceptions about parental rights , along with the risks and benefits of cancer treatment			1
here , i answer the questions i have been asked most			2
surely the parent ’s wishes ought to be paramount ? actually , no. the patient ’s rights are paramount			2
when there is danger to a child , doctors have to act in their best interests			0
some argue that doctors ought to have more power in the treatment of conditions such as measles , but unless there is a life - or - death situation you ca n’t impose health diktats			2
ms @entity18 was choosing a route that meant her son was more likely to die			1
case lost : after an appeal in @entity60 's @entity15 a judge ruled that @entity18 is no longer allowed to refuse treatment for @entity24 at what point are doctors acting in more than an advisory capacity ? where doctors believe that parental decisions may be not in a child ’s best interests , it can be necessary to seek a view from the courts			1
doctors believed @entity7 would die within months without radiotherapy			1
i see that ms @entity18 was in a desperate position , but she does n’t seem able to make a rational decision			1
there is a five - year survival rate of 86 per cent for patients with medulloblastoma – the type of cancer suffered by @entity7 – who have radiotherapy			1
due to the delays in his treatment , @entity86 now has an estimated 67 per cent chance of survival			2
@entity18 argued that radiotherapy could do more harm than good			1
could she be right ? all cancer treatment is backed up by data based on millions of patients			0
however , there are no absolutes			0
it ’s all about odds			0
we know the treatment most likely to work , but not whether it will be successful			0
actress @entity103 recently spoke about her decision to stop chemotherapy after surgery for breast cancer			0
should her cancer return , it is more likely to be terminal because chemotherapy helps to prevent the spread of tumours			0
a recent @entity114 study involving about 100,000 women concluded that having chemotherapy reduces breast cancer mortality by about a third			0
doctor 's advice : such as in the case of @entity24 , it is what is best for the patient which is paramount , not the parent 's wish but what about the damage radiotherapy could cause ? there are undoubtedly risks with radiation , including growth problems and infertility			1
however , given that medics concluded @entity24 would die without this treatment , the benefits outweigh the risks			1
@entity18 argued that the only evidence she was offered for the efficacy of radiation was a paper from the @entity142			2
is this true ? there is plenty of research backing up use of radiotherapy in this cancer			2
it is possible ms @entity18 has n’t seen this			1
children in developed countries have been given radiotherapy for more than half a century			2
if you compare the cancer survival rates of rich and poor countries , our treatments make a clear difference			0
what about the other medics advising her ? their opinions have been totally @entity165 was on the specialist register			0
it makes me so angry that these quacks prey on the vulnerable			0
none of the alternatives is clinically proven in the treatment of this cancer			0
if @entity18 is considered irresponsible , should @entity7 be taken away from her ? no. she is in an appalling position			1
my heart goes out to her			0
she is trying to do the best thing			0
this does n’t reflect on her everyday parenting			0
follow me on @entity182 @ @entity183			0

@entity18 refused to allow her son radiotherapy
seven - year - old @entity7 has a brain tumour
ms @entity18 lost court case in *december* and @entity24 is due to begin radiotherapy next week
