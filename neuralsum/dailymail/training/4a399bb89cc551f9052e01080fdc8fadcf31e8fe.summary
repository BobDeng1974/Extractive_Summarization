baffled , bewildered and afraid , a little @entity0 padded around the bodies of her friends - the journalists and cartoonists of @entity5			1
running from office to office she was the silent witness of a horror unfolding that would rock the world			0
as the ' house ' dog and mascot of the staff , @entity12 was a familiar and much loved figure to staff and visitors alike			1
she greeted all with a friendly wave of her tail but that morning , the day of the slayings , she was sticking close to her favourite - cartoonist @entity24 - known as @entity24			1
@entity12 knew that the ever generous @entity24 was a soft touch , so she stuck close by him as he took his place at the conference table where all were gathering			1
earlier , she had greeted the staff one by one as they came to the office , running between their legs , delighted to see them all together again			0
in a moving interview with @entity52 , @entity53 , crime reporter with the satirical magazine , held on to the normality of the dog 's pleasure as she described the horror that unfolded			1
one by one , with no time to react , her colleagues were murdered			1
@entity53 , who had left the conference room for the kitchen , started to crawl on hands and knees to another office as the gunfire exploded			2
from around the corner a masked man emerged , gun trained on her			0
his eyes she remembered were large , dark - and soft			0
six of the @entity5 journalists and staff members killed in wednesday 's attack are pictured together in this photo , taken in 2000			1

i wo n't kill you			0
we do n't kill women "			0
' but think about what you are doing			0
what you are doing is wrong			0
i 'm sparing you but because of this you must read the qur'an			0
' desperate not to inadvertently give away the still living - hidden men and women - @entity53 nodded			2
she lay still until hearing the terrorists flee and then crawled to the horrific scene in the conference room			0
' as i lay there , not sure if they were really gone , shots rang out in the distance , in the street			0
' and then i heard @entity12 with her tiny steps			1
' she pauses to mimic the click clack of the paws as the dog moved from office to office searching for her beloved , now dead , @entity24			1
escape : new amateur video shows the @entity5 killers , @entity124 and @entity125 , in a gun fight with police shortly after killing six staff members in the office inside triumphant : one of the brothers was caught on video chanting : ' we have avenged the @entity133 ' @entity5 's first edition since the attack will feature a cartoon of the @entity133 on its front page - weeping while holding a ' @entity139 ' placard			1
