former @entity1 gov. @entity0 on tuesday took his most definitive step yet toward running for president , announcing plans to ' actively explore ' a campaign and form a new political operation allowing him to raise money for like - minded @entity9			1
in a holiday message posted on @entity0 's @entity12 page and @entity14 account , the son and brother of past @entity9 presidents said he discussed the ' future of our nation ' and a potential bid for the @entity22 with members of his family over the @entity26 holiday			1
' as a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership i think @entity33 needs , i have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for president of the @entity33 , ' @entity0 wrote			1
@entity0 spoke at commencement exercises for the @entity42 on monday , telling new graduates they should avoid the impulse to pattern their lives after those of their parents he added , ' in the coming months , i hope to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of @entity33			1
' @entity53 , a spokeswoman for @entity0 , said he has not yet made a final decision on whether to seek the @entity9 's presidential nomination in 2016			1
she said that he will announce his decision next year ' after gauging support ' for a run			0
' this is a natural next step and represents a new phase of his consideration process , ' @entity53 said			0
that phase will include an expansion of @entity0 's political operations			1
he said tuesday he will start his own leadership political action committee in january , which will allow him to raise money and use it to support candidates in other races			2
in his statement , @entity0 said the committee ' will help me facilitate conversations with citizens across @entity33 to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation			2
the pac 's purpose will be to support leaders , ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all @entity33			2
' the @entity85 fired back in mere minutes			0
' is n’t this what he ’s been doing all along ? ' asked @entity85 communications director @entity89			0
' i do n’t know what the difference is between " thinking about " running and " actively exploring " running , but i suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news			0
' ' however you see it , there ’s no parsing this simple fact : @entity0 has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class			2
that ’s not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run			0
' @entity0 's announcement is also sure to reverberate throughout @entity9 politics and begin to help sort out a field that includes more than a dozen potential candidates , none of whom have formally announced plans to mount a campaign			1
should he ultimately decide to run , @entity0 can tap into his family 's vast political network and his campaign would attract strong support from the same donor pool that other establishment - minded @entity9 – @entity123 gov. @entity122 among them – need to fuel their own prospective campaigns			1
glory days : in 1999 ( pictured ) , @entity128 was in his post-presidency and his two sons @entity131 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) were both governors a @entity0 candidacy also has the potential to affect the plans of @entity1 sen. @entity135 , who came up through @entity1 politics as a strong @entity0 supporter and is considering whether to seek re-election to the @entity139 or run for president in 2016			1
@entity141 , a former iowa state @entity9 chairman , said he expected @entity0 to run in the @entity144 caucuses , as did his father and brother			1
@entity141 was among the earliest supporters of @entity131 , and among those who went to @entity148 , @entity149 , to court the then - @entity149 governor in 1999			1
' i think if you 're going to be a national candidate you have to go where the ballots are and not be afraid to trust your campaign to @entity144 voters , @entity156 voters , @entity152 voters and @entity154 voters , ' said @entity141 , who considers @entity0 among his top considerations for president			1
tuesday 's statement is the latest and most definitive signal that @entity0 plans to try and become the third member of his family to serve as president			1
in a tv interview this past weekend , he said he ' would be a good president , ' disclosed that he was writing an e-book about his time as governor that would come out in the spring , and promised to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office			2
during his two terms as @entity1 governor , @entity0 pushed for large tax cuts , overhauled @entity1 's education system and led the charge to eliminate race - based policies in college admissions and state spending			1
fighting words : on monday real estate tycoon @entity188 lobbed a rhetorical hand grenade , saying : ' i 'm a @entity9 but the last thing we need is another @entity0			1
and his position on immigration is ridiculous ' since leaving office , @entity0 has continued to advocate for more changes to the nation 's schools , including the adoption of new education standards known as @entity201			1
those standards have drawn the ire of conservatives who view them as a federal intrusion into local classrooms , but @entity0 has continued to call them critical to overhauling the country 's education system , while seeking common ground with opponents by saying states should be allowed to develop their own education programs			1
@entity141 said while @entity0 holds some positions that do n't sit well with some @entity9 activists , such as the @entity201 standards , ' i think they 'll realize his honesty and integrity on speaking out on his mind shows he has the courage of his convictions			2
' ' @entity223 will give him a serious look , ' @entity141 said			0
' and that 's all candidates can ask for			2
it 's up to him to make the sale to @entity223			2
' @entity0 has drawn fire from right - wingers over his position on immigration , which closely mirrors that of president @entity234			1
real estate tycoon @entity188 said monday night in @entity235 that he considered that to be a deal - breaker			0
' i 'm a @entity9 but the last thing we need is another @entity0 , ' he said			2
' and his position on immigration is ridiculous			0
' ' @entity242 and @entity243 ! ' like many of you , our family was blessed with the opportunity to gather together over the recent @entity26 holiday			0
' columba and i are so proud of the wonderful adults our children have become , and we loved spending time with our three precious grandchildren			0
' we shared good food and watched a whole lotof ( sic ) football			0
' we also talked about the future of our nation			0
as a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership i think @entity33 needs , i have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for @entity266			0
' in january , i also plan to establish a leadership pac that will help me facilitate conversations with citizens across @entity33 to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation			0
the pac 's purpose will be to support leaders , ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all @entity33			0
' in the coming months , i hope to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of @entity33			0
' @entity284 wishes to you and your families for a happy holiday season			0
i 'll be in touch soon			0
