she wrote : ' we had to acknowledge the grim truth , which was that @entity14 needed a bigger profile to get any kind of deal , we could get a load more gigs if we played to 15 million viewers , even if those viewers were of the opinion that a dog with a hula hoop constituted entertainment gold			2
' another extract for the post reads : ' we were uncomfortable that we were , by entering , complicit with the exploitation of the vulnerable to be humiliated in front of millions			0
but we had made ourselves publicity whores , we ’d made our bed , we had to play			0
