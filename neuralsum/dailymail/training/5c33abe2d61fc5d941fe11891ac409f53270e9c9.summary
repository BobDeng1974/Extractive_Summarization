by @entity0 luxury label @entity1 - loved by the likes of the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 - announced earlier this year that it would be collaborating with @entity8 on an affordable high - street line			1
last week we had a sneak peek of the collaboration 's take on the swishy blue silk wrap dress that @entity4 wore when her engagement news was delivered to the world in late 2010			0
and now , @entity17 brings you a look at the 40 - piece collection with @entity8 , designed for fashion fanatics hoping to get a touch of the @entity1 magic for less			1
available from between £ 25 and £ 100 per piece , the new collection is much more modestly priced than @entity1 's high end collections - but it still offers the @entity29 - born label 's signature wrap dresses , albeit with a high street twist			1
the line features kimono , wrap - tie and pleated dresses in patterns and block colours			0
there are also plenty of wrap - tie blouses in a range of vibrant colours , chunky knits for winter , as well as range of jewellery and accessories			0
speaking about the collaboration , @entity52 of @entity8 told @entity54 : ' we always love animal prints such as zebra and giraffe stripes			0
' @entity1 took that and modernised it			2
i love that the collection is our world and their world			2
' the fun campaign video , which has been unveiled today , shows a blonde model dancing in and out of a wardrobe wearing a different wrap - dress design each time			2
she then tries to impress a band of @entity73 style guards by prancing around them in her stylish dresses , even kissing one on the cheek			0
celebrity favourite : @entity5 loves the label and @entity80 was spotted out and about this week wearing the red and purple printed dress ( l , £ 75 , @entity84 , £ 85 ) expanding : @entity85 decided to buy a majority stake in the company and is now spearheading their global expansion , which looks set to do very well if their latest collaboration is anything to go by ( l - £ 75 , @entity84 - £ 85 ) prints : the boho - inspired line features kimono , wrap - tie and pleated dresses in patterns and block colours ( l - 65 , @entity84 - £ 85 ) fun : the campaign video shows a blonde model dancing around in a selection of dresses from the new collection the brand , which was already a huge success at @entity107 and in certain social circles , went global when @entity4 wore her £ 500 @entity1 wrap dress for her engagement announcement in 2010			1
it sparked one of the first of many ' @entity4 fashion frenzies ' and put the label even more firmly on the style map			0
both @entity5 and @entity117 walked in the @entity118 earlier this year , and while designers were bending over backwards to get model - of - the - moment @entity5 on their catwalk during @entity107 , she said she wanted to walk for @entity1 because its bohemian style was right up her street			1
however , @entity1 's founder @entity124 has since parted ways with the company , two years after @entity85 bought a majority stake in the company and spearheaded their global expansion project			0
