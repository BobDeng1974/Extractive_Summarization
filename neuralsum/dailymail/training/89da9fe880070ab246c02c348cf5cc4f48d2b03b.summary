the mystery of the @entity1 has drawn millions to the @entity2 in the search of the mythical beast			1
more than 80 years since she was first photographed , a recent spate of @entity1 sightings has added weight to the claims that there really is something lurking in the depths of the loch			1
but the numerous sightings of the so - called beast over the last weeks could be something far more mundane , with experts at the @entity18 suggesting people could just be seeing logs floating on the water			1
the @entity18 say ' deadfall ' washed out by rivers from nearby @entity44 could explain the vast number of sightings since the @entity1 was first photographed in 1934			1
' large amounts of wood flows out of the woodland through the two winding rivers that flow into @entity27 each year , peaking when water is high in late autumn and spring , ' a spokesman for the trust told the @entity54			2
' i think that some of that debris explains the long thin , sometimes stick - like , shapes seen			0
' the spokesman added that the wood was effectively a ' @entity1 spawning ground '			2
sightings of the @entity1 date back to the 6th century , but became more common from the 1930s after @entity65 and his wife claimed to see ' a most extraordinary form of animal ' cross the road in front of their car			1
this underwater photograph from 1972 is said to have been taken during an expedition using sophisticated underwater cameras and sonar equipment this picture , taken in 1934 , sparked a surge in visits to @entity27 by people desperate to photograph the beast the @entity83 ' story led thousands of people to visit @entity27 to try to take a photograph of the creature			1
after sonar searches , countless hoaxes and dozens of weird and wonderful explanations for the sightings , no one has taken a clear picture of @entity1			2
in 2006 , palaeontologist @entity93 , from @entity95 's @entity94 , put forward an intriguing explanation linking the @entity1 sightings to elephants			1
he said circuses used to visit @entity100 often and would stop on the banks of @entity27 to give the animals a rest			2
there are similarities between trunks and some of the most famous @entity1 photographs , he said			0
' the circuses used to take the road up to @entity100 and allow their animals to have a rest , swim about in the @entity27 and refresh themselves , ' dr @entity93 said at the time			0
more recently , images have emerged allegedly showing @entity1 poking her head out of the water , but the blurry images and video are not clear cut			0
last year a satellite picture from an @entity120 map app appeared to show a large , mysterious creature swimming through the loch			0
the @entity124 @entity123 said the sighting was ' likely ' to be a true image of the beast			0
in 2013 , this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of @entity27 was photographed by an @entity120 map app a poll conducted in 2012 found that 24 per cent of people professed belief in the @entity27 monster following @entity1 's first modern sightings in the 1930s , which were often printed in newspapers , thousands took to @entity27 to try to take their own picture of the mysterious creature			1
dozens of blurry images emerged , with some taking to creating elaborate hoaxes of the hidden beast			0
here are some of the most famous sightings of the @entity1			2
this blurred picture , said to show the @entity1 , was taken by @entity150 in 1933 and published in the @entity151 a close - up of what could be the @entity1			0
the photo was taken by @entity155 in 2011 in 2001 semi-retired photographer @entity156 and friend @entity157 took this while they were out fishing			0

@entity1 sightings may actually be logs , @entity18 say
@entity166 could be to blame for all @entity27 sightings , the charity said
several people claim to have seen the creature in the last few weeks
