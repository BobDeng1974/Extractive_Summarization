while they might seem poles apart , the lexicon of beauty is surprisingly similar to the jargon of @entity5			1
from brushes , gloss and varnish to primers , tape and files , it ’s all about preparing the surface and then making it more attractive			1
in a @entity5 store last week , i noticed the similarity between sandpaper and the foot file i use for removing rough skin off my feet — but at a fraction of the price			1
it made me wonder if @entity25 could actually be the cut - price beauty store i ’d been searching for			1
i decided to experiment , with some fascinating results			2
@entity28 beauty : @entity30 , £ 21 , timetospa.co.uk @entity25 : 5 - inch @entity31 , £ 3 every beauty expert i ’ve met swears by body brushing — using a stiff bristle brush in sweeping strokes , working from the tips of your toes and fingers towards the heart			1
it ’s said to boost lymphatic drainage , resulting in less water retention , and promote circulation so skin looks more radiant			1
some people even believe it can improve the appearance of cellulite			2
normally i use the @entity51 but i thought that a stiff plastic - bristled masonry brush could do the job just as well			2
and while it ’s definitely less aesthetically pleasing , the bristles feel just like more expensive cactus ones of the @entity58 version , although they bend more easily because they ’re longer			1
winner : @entity25 — although only after i ’d cut the bristles down to half their size			2
but when you ’re saving £ 18 , it ’s worth a little effort			1
@entity65 - @entity64 beauty : @entity67 , £ 14.95 , @entity68 @entity25 : @entity69 , £ 12.78 hair obsessives rave about microfibre towels that absorb water from the hair more quickly than normal towels			1
i ’ve never been particularly convinced that mine does this			2
working on the principle that a chamois leather , usually used for washing cars , readily soaks up water , i used one , as i do the towel , to create a turban after washing my hair			2
fifteen minutes later , most of my hair was dry , in half the time it usually takes			2
the wet leather smelled a bit , well , leathery , but did n’t make my hair smell odd			2
i ’m chucking out my microfibre towel			2
@entity94 @entity93 beauty : @entity96 , £ 5 , sttropeztan.co.uk @entity25 : @entity97 , £ 2.75 to avoid stained palms , the only way to apply fake tan is with a mitt — a pocket with a plasticised inside and a fabric exterior			1
rather than squirting some of my usual mousse onto a mitt , i poured a little liquid tan into the tray of a miniature roller set and set about covering my legs			2
the roller soaked up far too much liquid , and the coverage was patchy			0
perhaps a paint pad , less absorbent than a roller , but also used for daubing walls , would have been better ? winner : beauty — efficient , if less fun than decorating yourself			1
@entity120 beauty : @entity122 , £ 3.57 , sttropeztan.co.uk @entity25 : @entity69 home care @entity123 , £ 1.38 if you ’ve never been for a professional fake tan , you might not have encountered a finishing mitt			1
when you have been sprayed a deep mahogany colour , the therapist takes a soft mitt and pats down your skin , gently buffing away tell - tale streaks , rather as if you were a newly - waxed @entity133			0
it might sound absurd , but it makes the difference between a good finish and a perfect finish , so i now do the same at home			0
i used a mitt designed for polishing a car			0
apart from being bright blue , rather than tasteful black , and about twice the size of the @entity96 version , it worked brilliantly			0
the microfibre fabric felt soft against my skin and the internal seam , which allows you to put fingers either side			0
winner : @entity25 — easy to use and covers a bigger area			0
@entity156 beauty : 96 @entity158 , £ 3.05 @entity25 : masking tape , £ 1.76 while expert manicurists might be able to create the perfect @entity162 manicure — pale pink with white tips — we more cack - handed types often turn to little stickers that act as a guide so you get a perfect line			1
it ’s what decorators do with masking tape , but on a smaller scale			1
using masking tape on my nails gave a straight line rather than the traditional curved one , but the tape stuck well to the nail , the polish did n’t seep underneath , and i quite liked that the straight line gave a more modern effect			1
winner : @entity25 — though if you ’re a purist , you might want to shell out for curved stickers			0
cleansing @entity188 beauty : three @entity190 , £ 14 , evelom.com @entity25 : ten @entity191 , £ 1.98 @entity193 ’s waxy cleanser , launched in 1983 , pioneered the trend for greasy , balm - like cleansers that are removed with warm water and a muslin cleansing cloth			1
now everyone from @entity58 to boots and @entity199 does a hot - cloth cleanser			0
the problem is that even if you regularly boil - wash them , the pricey cloths soon become grubby			0
could a regular cotton dishcloth do the same job ? i ’ve been using one for a week and i ’ll never go back to muslin again			0
the cotton was soft on my face and gives a gentle exfoliation			0
winner : @entity25 — much as i love @entity193 , i wo n’t be paying the best part of £ 5 for muslin when a 20p cloth does the same thing			0
flexible rollers beauty : 12 @entity219 , £ 4.09 , superdrug.com @entity25 : @entity220 , £ 4 years ago , i used bendy rollers to create soft curls			1
it was simple : you took the curler — essentially a wire - covered sponge — wound a towel - dried section of hair round it , starting at the bottom and working toward the roots , and then bent over the ends of the roller to hold the hair in place			0
then you let the hair dry before releasing the curls			0
i thought padded wire for plants might be able to do the same thing			0
i knew the wire was thinner than the normal rollers , but thought bending it over on itself might work			0
but although i managed to wrap my hair around it , no matter how many ways i bent it , the hair would n’t stay put			0
and , to make matters worse , the rubber coating on the wire gripped the hair and caused it to pull and tangle			0
winner : beauty — bendy rollers are a relatively simple design , but they ’ve proved they ’re more than just a twist of wire			1
@entity255 beauty : @entity257 , £ 18 , debenhams.com @entity25 : @entity258 , £ 3.98 the soft , tightly - packed bristles of @entity257 ’s brush do a wonderful job of buffing foundation into the skin so you get a flawless finish			1
the same could n’t be said for the paintbrush i attempted to use in its place			0
while actually it was pretty good at daubing my warpaint on and did n’t , to my surprise , leave streaks , it was scratchy and uncomfortable to use			0
winner : beauty — unless you really want your foundation application to double as exfoliation			1
foot file beauty : file @entity281 , £ 5 , thebodyshop.co.uk @entity25 : norton expert @entity283 , £ 3.98 surely i ca n’t be the only one who ’s looked at an emery board or a foot file and thought , ‘ is n’t this just pricey sandpaper ? ’ i went for a fine - grained sanding sponge , worried that anything too gritty might actually draw blood			1
the angled block was ‘ ideal for sanding contoured surfaces , corners and hard to reach areas ’ — it sounded perfect			0
i used the large surface on the bottom of my feet , and the pointed bit to tackle hard skin on the tips of my toes , and it was just as effective as my normal foot file			1
winner : a draw — while the block did exactly what i needed it to , and was much better at tackling toes , the foot file ’s longer handle made it easier to scrub my heels .			2
