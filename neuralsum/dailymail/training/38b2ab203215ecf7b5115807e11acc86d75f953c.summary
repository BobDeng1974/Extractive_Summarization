@entity8 researchers claim being exposed to symbols of fast food and other signs of disposable society could make the smaller , everyday things in life harder to enjoy			1
they singled out @entity1 as the ' ultimate symbol of time efficiency ' researchers from the @entity28 picked the @entity1 symbol to examine , as they claim it has become the ‘ ultimate symbol of time efficiency ’ in the modern world			2
student @entity33 and professors @entity34 and @entity37 - @entity36 , from the university , told @entity39 : ‘ it is ironic that technologies designed to improve well - being by minimising time spent on mundane chores may ultimately undermine the surplus leisure time they permit			0
‘ by instigating a sense of impatience , these technologies may prevent people from savouring the enjoyable moments life offers serendipitously			2
' the research , published in journal @entity53 , discovered that people who regularly see fast - food symbols , are not as likely to savour enjoyment in art and music			1
an examination of 280 participants in the @entity61 found people while living in neighbourhoods packed with fast food outlets were less likely to savour enjoyable experiences			1
the study found that people living near fast food outlets had lesser emotional responses to enjoyable experiences , such as finding pleasure in art ( pictured ) and music in another experiment , 250 people rated the suitability of five advertising images , three of which were ‘ neutral ’ and two showed @entity1 meals			1
half of the survey participants saw food displayed in the @entity1 packaging , while the other half saw the same food on ceramic plates			0
half of the participants were also shown scenes of natural beauty and all those who took part were asked to rate their happiness			0
the scientists found that people who looked at the pictures of natural beauty were happier than those who had not , but the effect was lost on those who had also looked at the @entity1 symbol as they reported being less happy than those people who had only looked at the scenery			0
another 122 participants rated the same five images of food but some listened to 86 seconds of ‘ @entity105 ’ from opera @entity106			0
unhappy meal ? @entity8 researchers claim being exposed to symbols of fast food and other signs of disposable society could make the smaller , everyday things in life harder to enjoy those who had only listened to the music and seen the neutral food images thought the music had lasted longer than it did , , while those who had also seen the @entity1 food in its official packaging reported a less positive emotional response to the piece of music and were less patient			1
the researchers believe it is important to understand the influence of advertising symbols as they are so prevalent in our everyday environment			0
‘ as a ubiquitous symbol of an impatient culture , fast food not only impacts people ’s physical health but may also shape their experience of happiness in unexpected ways , ’ they said			2
however , they stressed the findings only examined a small sample of ‘ early pleasures ’ and that happiness does not simply rely on the savouring of experiences .			0

@entity8 researchers said people who regularly see fast - food symbols , are not as likely to savour enjoyment of art and music
@entity28 researchers claim *concentration* of fast food *restaurants* in neighbourhoods predicted their *tendencies* to savour
they think fast food symbols instill a sense of impatience that stop people from enjoying the little things in life
