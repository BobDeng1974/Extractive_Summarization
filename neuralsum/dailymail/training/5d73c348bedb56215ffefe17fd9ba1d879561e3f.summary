the fall out from @entity3 's @entity2 nuclear power plant disaster two years ago appears to have found its way into the food chain , as a series of snaps apparently showing ' mutant vegetables ' have emerged online			1
a @entity10 website has published pictures of flowers , vegetables and fruit covered with deformities and lumps			1
but it is not immediately clear where the produce was farmed from , whether the images have been doctored and whether the nuclear disaster is in fact to blame			2
an apparently mutated tomato looks as if it has exploded into mutant form			2
it has been claimed the fall out from @entity3 's @entity2 nuclear power plant disaster two years ago has found its way into the food chain these two peaches seem to have doubled			1
flowers , vegetables and fruit with deformities and lumps all over it have been photographed and shared on website @entity35 left , four oranges appear to be joined at the stem , and left a mushroom looks to have been speared by its own stalk			0
the @entity41 nuclear power plant meltdown was triggered by an 8.9 magnitude earthquake in 2011			1
the disaster - which claimed the lives of 18,500 people - was the largest nuclear disaster since the @entity47 in 1986			2
while none of the deaths have been attributed to radiation exposure from the meltdown , high levels of radiation have been detected in groundwater near the plant			0
among the ' mutant vegetables ' is a giant tomato apparently bubbling with tumours , a five - fingered turnip , and two peaches which have grown into figures of eight			1
a vegetable grower holds a ' mutant cabbage ' as his companion holds aloft a normal sized comparison while the fruit looks to have mutated it it is not immediately clear where the produce was farmed from , whether the images have been doctored and whether the nuclear disaster is in fact to blame two gardeners hold cabbages aloft - one a normal size - the other at least four times bigger			2
and in one picture a cucumber seems to have formed into a strange hybrid with leaves erupting from the base			0
earlier this year a fish caught close the the @entity2 nuclear plant was over 2,500 times the legal safe radiation limit for seafood , the plant 's operator revealed			1
the company @entity89 ( @entity89 ) caught the fish , dubbed ' @entity92 ' online , in the bay close to the @entity95 main reactor			0
it was confirmed by @entity89 to have amounts of radioactive cesium equal to 254,000 becquerels per kilogram , or 2540 times the limit of 100 becquerels / kg set for seafood by the government			0
a tomato appears to have green shoots sprouting out of it among the ' mutant vegetables ' is a giant tomato apparently bubbling with tumours , a five - fingered turnip a report in october last year found radiation levels in most kinds of fish caught off the coast of @entity2 have n't declined in the year following @entity3 's nuclear disaster in march 2011			1
an earthquake knocked out nuclear plant 's cooling system , causing three reactor cores to melt and spew radiation into the ocean			0
researchers believe that deposits of the chemical cesium on the seafloor or leakage from the damaged reactors is continuing to contaminate the waters - and has the potential to threaten fisheries for decades			0
the levels in the fish are also 10 times higher than the radiation measured last august in scorpion fish caught near @entity2			0
a sunflower has apparently grown in the centre of another plant in this picture uploaded on to @entity139 the @entity2 disaster - which claimed the lives of 18,500 people - was the largest nuclear disaster since the @entity47 in 19 the @entity3 @entity144 has contacted us since the publication of our item and asked us to clarify that there is no evidence to suggest that the images are related to the @entity2 incident			1
it adds that the percentage of fish caught off @entity2 measuring above @entity155 fell from 53 % after the incident to 5.4 % earlier this year according to a survey .			0

series of snaps apparently showing ' mutant vegetables ' have emerged online
they were posted by a @entity10 website - it is not clear when they were taken
