@entity0 has signed a new long - term contract after @entity3 ’s owners promised he will be given every help to make the club champions			1
@entity0 , who was named @entity6 after he took @entity3 to within two points of the title last season , completed the formalities of signing a deal on monday and the improved terms , which are believed to run to 2018 , reflect his outstanding work			1
personal gain , however , is not his motivation and the main crux of negotiations with @entity18 – who described @entity0 as a ' hugely talented individual ' – stemmed around boosting a squad that will have the added demands next year of a @entity24 campaign			1
saint : @entity25 ( centre ) was one of the stand - out performers of the 2013 - 14 @entity29 season positive : despite missing out on the title last season was an excellent one for @entity3 and @entity0 @entity3 have identified a number of targets , headed by @entity25			1
negotiations continue for the @entity37 midfielder , who has his heart set on a move to @entity40 , but they are taking time because @entity41 are looking to command £ 30milllion			2
@entity43 ’s @entity42 is an alternative to @entity25 , while @entity3 are working on a deal to sign @entity49 , the £ 12million - rated @entity47 under 21 midfielder , who was at @entity48 last season			1
@entity0 says @entity18 ’s support heading into the transfer window is crucial			2
‘ i came here because i felt that this is one of the biggest clubs in the world , ’ he explained			2
‘ i want to be here as long as i can , hopefully playing a part in building and restoring a club to its greatness			2
i think we ’ve really rediscovered the soul of @entity3 in particular this season			1
delighted : @entity0 said he was very happy to sign a new deal with @entity3 international : @entity25 ( right ) saw his good form rewarded with a place in @entity37 's @entity68 squad ‘ so i ’ve got absolutely no interest in being anywhere else			1
but i also needed to know it ’s going to be right because i want to succeed			2
i want to win and i need to know that if i am going to be here i ’m going to have the best possibility to win			0
‘ i need to know that this is an idea and a way of working that ’s set up to win ; it ’s not just to look good			0
and i need to know that i can have players that can carry out the instructions that we want to work to win trophies			0
the owners have been great			0
‘ but we want to work it in a way that makes the club sustainable and i think we ’ve clearly shown that it ’s about the top quality but it ’s also about being strategic in those signings as well , bringing in the right players			0
it ’s key for me that i can speak to the owners like that			0
’ available : @entity49 ( centre ) is important for @entity48 but a release clause means he is available frustrated : @entity43 winger @entity42 ( right ) has found first team games hard to come by @entity3 had difficulties attracting the players @entity0 had targeted 12 months ago – @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 – because they were unable to offer @entity24 football but he is convinced the forthcoming window will be different			1
‘ the best players want to play in the big competition , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ that ’s the fight and i certainly found that last summer but we ’ve put @entity3 back on the map now			1
everyone sees that we ’re going to be a threat ; that we ’re going to go into @entity111 next year and we ’ll have no fear			0
‘ we need to pay attention in terms of the teams we ’ll be playing against , but we ’ll have no fear			0
that ’s what top players want – they want to play in teams where they can show their talents			0
’ crucial : @entity0 said it was vital that he had the support of the @entity3 board in the transfer market			1
