future wars could be fought entirely on the internet , the defence secretary @entity0 claimed today			1
the cabinet minister said military technology was changing rapidly with ' cyber ' warfare the battleground of the future			1
he told a @entity9 gathering that internet - based attacks could replace boots on the ground - in the same way tanks replaced horses in the @entity16			2
the @entity18 video game is hugely popular - but could become a reality in the future			0
while cyber warfare will have nothing to do with video shoot ' em ups , malicious computer viruses are likely to be the new weapon of choice for @entity27 countries that are unwilling to risk their soldiers lives on a real battlefield mr @entity0 said the internet was the ' new frontier ' for the military because the public was no longer prepared to accept @entity36 soldiers being killed on the front line			1
he said : ‘ i can tell you with some degree of confidence that there will never again be a conflict in which cyber does not play a major role			1
' mr @entity0 said this would either be in the form of background support for the ' conventional application of force '			1
but it was ' possible to envisage entire conflicts being fought in cyberspace ' , mr @entity0 said			1
‘ the vulnerability that modern societies , modern militaries have to networked it systems makes this inevitable and makes our exposure all the more significant , ' he said			0
the defence secretary @entity0 said all conflicts in the future would have an element of cyber warfare ‘ there is a remarkable alignment amongst military chiefs about where we need to invest			1
' we need to invest in cyber ; we need to invest in intelligence , surveillance , target acquisition and reconnaissance			0
‘ in modern warfare , we need to know where our targets are – our public does not tolerate collateral damage or , allow me another piece of jargon , “ civ caz ” any longer			1
’ mr @entity0 said ' military capability ' could only be measured against other countries ' armies			1
he said : ' we ca n’t stand still because our enemies do n’t stand still			0
we have to evolve , we have to change how we deliver military effect all the time			0
‘ so while looking back to our proud military traditions , we always have to be prepared to embrace the future			2
‘ at the time of the @entity90 it was moving from horses to tanks ; in the late 19th century it was the debate about whether the machine gun would ever catch on			0
‘ the frontier now is around cyber ; the investment that we are making in cyber			2
’ cyber warfare 's potential was exposed in the suspected @entity101 assault on @entity103 's nuclear weapons programme in 2010			2
a computer virus called @entity105 - allegedly designed by @entity101 in collaboration with the @entity109 - infected @entity103 's top - security @entity108 uranium enrichment site			0
@entity103 president @entity110 admitted the virus had set back his country 's nuclear ambitions			0
the @entity105 virus worked by increasing the speed of uranium centrifuges to breaking point			0
at the same time it shut off safety monitoring systems , hoodwinking operators that all was normal .			0

@entity0 says internet warfare is next military ' frontier '
says there will ' never again be a conflict in which cyber does not play a role '
public no longer prepared to tolerate soldiers being killed in *foreign* wars
