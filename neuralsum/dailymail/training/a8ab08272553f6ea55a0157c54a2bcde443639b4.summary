@entity1 ’s true colour has been revealed in amazing detail by a @entity4 weather satellite			1
from a distance of 22,240 miles ( 35,790km ) , the satellite shows what our planet looks like before any filters or image enhancements are made to the shot			1
and the incredibly high resolution image also highlights stunning details on @entity1 including clouds , oceans and @entity18 ’s vast desert			2
it wascaptured using all 16 image bands from the satellite			2
testing of @entity29 's systems , including related ground facilities , are reportedly going well the image was taken by @entity4 ’s @entity33 weather satellite , which launched on 7 october 2014 and is said to be the first true - colour image returned by the satellite to @entity1			1
a huge 11,000 by 11,000 pixel version is available on the @entity22 's ( @entity22 ) website , although the makes advise downloading the file , rather than view it in a browser , because the image can take a long time to load			0
the satellite was placed in a geostationary orbit above @entity1 , which means it stays above the same portion of the planet - in this case @entity18 , @entity4 and the other regions seen			1
the instrument used to take the image was the @entity51 ( @entity52 ) on the spacecraft			0
@entity54 is actually one of two twin satellites that will be used to provide continuous observation of the @entity59 and @entity60 regions			1
the next satellite , called @entity21 - 9 , will launch in 2016			1
the use of the words ‘ true colour ’ is a little bit of a misnomer , as this is not exactly what the planet would look like to the human eye			1
most images we see of @entity1 are colour - corrected to show how humans would see them			2
this image , however , was taken in multiple bands and shows the natural appearance of @entity1 from space			1
the image is said to be ' true colour ' as it shows what the planet would look like from space without a human eye			1
however , to us the planet appears slightly more blue and colourful			0
by brightening the picture , shown , more detail and features can be revealed the stunning 11,000 x 11,000 pixel shot reveals a huge amount of detail			0
here can be seen the north coast of @entity18 , with the sun 's light glinting in the @entity95 , while wisps of clouds can also be seen at the bottom of the image data from the @entity102 spacecraft taken from comet @entity103 suggests @entity1 's water may have come from asteroids , not comets			1
the @entity107 for @entity108 and @entity109 - on the spacecraft ' sniffed ' the comet 's atmosphere as it remained in orbit and analysed its composition			2
it found that water in the comet 's atmosphere had a different ratio of deuterium - to - hydrogen than water on @entity1			2
this may be the final nail in the coffin for the theory that comets brought water to @entity1 - and it may have finally proven that we have asteroids to thank for allowing life on our planet to thrive			2
in the centre of the image , the sun ’s glint reflecting off the ocean , just north of @entity18 , can be seen			0
further north , partially covered by clouds , is @entity4 and the rest of @entity59			2
to the right is the vast @entity60 , perhaps highlighting one of the most striking things about the image ; namely , how much of our planet is covered by water			0
@entity1 ’s surface is 71 per cent water , with the other 29 per cent being the continents and islands			0
a whopping 96.5 per cent of this water is contained in the ocean as salt water , with the remaining 3.5 per cent being freshwater lakes and ice			0
but despite covering the vast majority of the surface , water accounts for just 0.02 per cent of our planet ’s mass as , relative to the planet itself , the oceans are not very deep			0
where exactly all this water came from has been a cause of much debate in recent years			0
as @entity1 was scorchingly hot early in its life , it ’s widely believed that water was brought to @entity1 by space rocks : asteroids or comets			0
a few weeks ago , however , results from @entity173 ’s @entity102 mission indicated that the water contained on the comet it is orbiting , @entity177 , differs from that on @entity1			0
this supports the theory that water was brought to @entity1 by asteroids , not comets - although scientists note that further findings and studies will be needed to confirm the theory			0
@entity54 , illustration shown , is actually one of two twin satellites that will be used to provide continuous observation of the @entity59 and @entity60 regions			1
the next satellite , @entity21 - 9 , will launch in 2016 other images of @entity1 , such as @entity195 's famous @entity194 images ( @entity196 shown ) , use image enhancement and colour correction to show what the planet would look like to the human eye from space			1

an image taken by a @entity4 satellite launch on 7 october 2014 has *snapped* the true colour of planet earth
taken in multiple *wavelength* bands , the image from the @entity33 weather satellite shows @entity1 's natural colour
to the human eye the planet would appear differently , but this is what it looks like without image enhancement
@entity29 took the image from geostationary orbit 22,240 miles ( 35,790km ) away from the planet
the satellite will be used with a twin , @entity21 - 9 , to provide continuous observation of the @entity59 region
