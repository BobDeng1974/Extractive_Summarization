@entity0 may have suffered the shame of exiting the @entity2 after just two games , but @entity4 still seems to have found time to enjoy himself			1
@entity4 , who has played just 17 minutes of the @entity0 ' disastrous campaign , was seen pictured smiling and laughing by the sea at @entity8 , @entity9			2
sunday was @entity0 's final day in @entity9 before they fly to @entity27 on monday ahead of their final match			0
@entity30 's team face @entity31 on tuesday hoping to avoid the embarrassment of becoming the first @entity34 side to leave a @entity2 without a single point			0
challenging times : @entity4 has only featured in 17 minutes of @entity0 's campaign so far , as a sub against @entity39 resigned : @entity0 's players looked unenthusiastic in their final training session in @entity9 @entity43 thing : full - back @entity43 is expected to start for @entity0 in the absence of @entity46 heading home : @entity48 is yet to make an impression at the @entity2 , limited to just 3 minutes on the pitch defeats to @entity39 and @entity52 , coupled with @entity31 's remarkable double shock over the two sides , mean @entity0 can not get out of the group whatever the result .			1
