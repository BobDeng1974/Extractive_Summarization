by @entity0 for @entity1 snow on sea ice in the western @entity5 has thinned by a third and , in some areas , is half as thick as it was 60 years ago , alarming new research has revealed			1
this ' significant ' rate of snow loss is according to decades of research which found snow has thinned from 14 inches to 9 inches ( 36cm to 23cm ) in the western regions			1
it has also thinned by around 13 inches to 6 inches ( 33 cm to 15 cm ) over the @entity14 and @entity15 seas , west and north of @entity16 , respectively			1
snow on sea ice in the western @entity5 has thinned by a third and , in some areas , is half as thick as it was 60 years ago			1
this ' significant ' rate of snow loss is according to decades of research the thinning snow could influence the @entity5 ecosystem , with tiny microscopic plants that are key to the @entity5 food chain growing beneath the sea ice , the research said			1
the data was collected @entity26 and the @entity27 using ice buoys , aircraft surveys and historic data from ice floes staffed by @entity33 scientists from the late 1950s			0
' the snow cover is like a shield that can insulate sea ice , ' said dr @entity37 of @entity26 's @entity38			1
' in this study , we had thousands of measurements of snow depth on sea ice to thoroughly validate @entity26 's aircraft observations			2
this graph shows the change in springtime @entity5 snow depth compared to the average ( shown in red )			2
the data come from @entity33 drifting ice stations ( 1950 - 1987 ) , @entity53 buoys ( 1993 - 2013 ) , and the @entity55 airborne project ( 2009 - 2013 ) @entity27 graduate student @entity56 uses a probe to measure snow depth and verify @entity26 airborne data			2
she is walking on sea ice near @entity61 , @entity16 ' we knew @entity5 sea ice was decreasing , but the snow cover has become so thin that its shield has become a veil			1
' scientists believe the reason for the thinning snow may be that the surface freeze - up is happening later in the fall so the year 's heaviest snowfalls , in september and october			2
what thinner snow will mean for the ice is not certain			0
deeper snow actually shields ice from cold air , so a thinner blanket may allow the ice to grow thicker during the winter			0
on the other hand , thinner snow cover may allow the ice to melt earlier in the springtime			2
thinner snow could also impact animals that use the snow to make dens , and for low - light microscopic plants that grow underneath the sea ice			1
@entity91 has thinned from 14 inches to 9 inches ( 36cm to 23cm ) in the western regions			1
it has also thinned by 13 inches to 6 inches ( 33 cm to 15 cm ) over the @entity14 and @entity15 seas , west and north of @entity16 , respectively @entity56 measuring snow depth outside @entity61 , @entity16 ( left )			1
scientists believe the reason for the thinning snow may be that the surface freeze - up is happening later in the fall so the year 's heaviest snowfalls , in september and october the new results support a 15 - year - old @entity27 - led study in which @entity105 and @entity106 scientists first analysed the historic @entity5 snow measurements			1
that paper detected a slight decline in spring snow depth that the authors believed , even then , was due to a shorter ice - covered season			0
' the delay in sea ice freeze - up could be changing the way that heat is transported in the @entity5 , which would , in turn , affect precipitation patterns , ' said first author @entity56 , an oceanography graduate student at the @entity27			1
' that 's going to be a very interesting question in the future			0
' research suggests that some @entity5 lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere			0
this counters a widely - held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming			0
the study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish , leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption			0
supported by the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) , the study was published earlier this month in the journal @entity141 and focused on thermokarst lakes			0
these occur when permafrost thaws and create surface depressions that fill with melted fresh water , converting what was previously frozen land into lakes			0
the research suggests that @entity5 thermokarst lakes are ' net climate coolers ' when observed over longer time scales , namely several thousand years , although they initially warm the climate			0
the researchers observed that roughly 5,000 years ago , thermokarst lakes in ice - rich regions of @entity158 and @entity16 began cooling , instead of warming the atmosphere			2
' until now , we 've only thought of thermokarst lakes as positive contributors to climate warming , ' said lead researcher dr @entity165 , associate research professor at the @entity166 .			0

@entity91 has thinned 14 inches to 9 inches ( 36cm - 23cm ) in western regions
it has thinned up to 13 inches ( 33cm - 15cm ) in @entity14 and @entity15 seas
thinning snow could influence the @entity5 ecosystem , as tiny microscopic plants that are key to the @entity5 food chain grow beneath the sea ice
' we knew @entity5 sea ice was decreasing , but the snow cover has become so thin that its shield has become a veil , ' the researchers said
