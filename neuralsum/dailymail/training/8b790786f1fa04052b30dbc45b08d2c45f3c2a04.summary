three years of observations show that the @entity2 ice sheet is now losing 159 gigatonnes of ice each year - twice as much as when it was last surveyed in 2012			1
a team of scientists from the @entity7 @entity8 , led by researchers at the @entity10 , have produced the first complete assessment of @entity2 ice sheet elevation change			1
they used measurements collected by @entity17 's @entity16 satellite mission , which carries an altimeter , an instrument to measure altitude , specially designed for this task			1
a survey from 2010 to 2013 by @entity17 's @entity16 satellite shows that the @entity24 is now losing 159 @entity25 of ice each year , enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 millimetres per year			1
colour scale ranges in this image from -1 to +1 metres ( 3.3 feet ) per year in sharp contrast to previous altimeter missions , @entity16 surveys virtually the entire @entity2 continent , reaching to within 135 miles ( 215 kilometres ) of the @entity34			2
this has enabled a fivefold increase in the sampling of coastal regions where today 's ice losses are concentrated			2
79.5 trillion laptops 2.27 trillion people 14.5 billion @entity43 space telescopes 381 million international space stations 3.06 million @entity45 430,000 @entity47 buildings 397 times the world ’s human population 32 teaspoons of neutron star 22 % of the mass of carbon stored in @entity54 ’s atmosphere overall , the pattern of imbalance continues to be dominated by glaciers thinning in the @entity59 sector of @entity60			0
however , thanks to the improved capabilities of @entity16 , problem areas such as the rugged terrain of the @entity63 can now also be surveyed			0
on average @entity60 lost 134 gigatonnes of ice , @entity68 three gigatonnes , and the @entity63 23 gigatonnes in each year between 2010 and 2013 - a total loss of 159 gigatonnes each year			1
the polar ice sheets are a major contributor to global sea level rise and , when combined , the @entity2 losses detected by @entity16 are enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 millimetres each year alone			1
the largest loss of ice is occurring at the @entity77 , with the @entity78 shown here			0
@entity60 is losing 139 gigatonnes of the total 159 gigatonnes every year , which is double the rate of ice loss from 2005 to 2010 in @entity60 , ice thinning has been detected in areas that were poorly surveyed by past satellite altimeter missions			1
these newly - mapped areas contribute additional losses that bring altimeter observations closer to estimates based on other approaches			0
but the average rate of ice thinning in @entity60 has also increased , and this sector is now losing almost one third ( 31 % ) as much ice each year than it did during the five year period ( 2005 to 2010 ) prior to @entity16 's launch			1
lead author dr @entity96 from the @entity10 said : ' we find that ice losses continue to be most pronounced along the fast - flowing ice streams of the @entity59 sector , with thinning rates of between 4 and 8 metres [ 13 to 26 feet ] per year near to the grounding lines of the @entity78 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
' this sector of @entity60 has long been identified as the most vulnerable to changes in climate and , according to recent assessments , its glaciers may have passed a point of irreversible retreat			0
launched in 2010 , @entity16 carries a radar altimeter that can ' see ' through clouds and in the dark , providing continuous measurements over areas like @entity60 that are prone to bad weather and long periods of darkness			0
the radar can measure the surface height variation of ice in fine detail , allowing scientists to record changes in its volume with unprecedented accuracy			0
@entity17 ¿ s @entity131 mission ( artist ¿ s illustration shown ) was launched on 8 april 2010 and is dedicated to precise monitoring of changes in the thickness of marine ice floating in the polar oceans and variations in the thickness of the vast ice sheets that blanket @entity142 and @entity60 professor @entity143 , also of the @entity10 , who led the study , added : ' thanks to its novel instrument design and to its near - polar orbit , @entity16 allows us to survey coastal and high - latitude regions of @entity60 that were beyond the capability of past altimeter missions , and it seems that these regions are crucial for determining the overall imbalance			1
' although we are fortunate to now have , in @entity16 , a routine capability to monitor the polar ice sheets , the increased thinning we have detected in @entity60 is a worrying development			0
' it adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are underway in this part of our planet , which has enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than a metre [ 3.3 feet ]			2
' the challenge is to use this evidence to test and improve the predictive skill of climate models			0
' and professor @entity169 of the @entity170 said : ' the increasing contribution of @entity60 to sea - level rise is a global issue , and we need to use every technique available to understand where and how much ice is being lost			0
' through some very clever technical improvements , @entity96 and his colleagues have produced the best maps of @entity2 ice - loss we have ever had			2
' prediction of the rate of future global sea - level rise must begin with a thorough understanding of current changes in the ice sheets - this study puts us exactly where we need to be			2
' and finally dr @entity190 at the @entity191 , author of a recent study simulating future @entity2 ice sheet losses , concluded : ' this study does a nice job of revealing the strong thinning along the @entity197 , which is consistent with theory and models indicating this region is in the early stages of collapse			1

@entity17 's @entity16 mission has provided new data on the @entity2 ice sheet
it surveyed the region from 2010 to 2013 and found losses had doubled
in total the ice sheet is losing 159 gigatonnes ( 159 billion tonnes ) each year
that is twice the rate of ice loss found in the last survey from 2005 to 2010
and just this loss alone will raise sea levels by half a millimetre a year
but sea levels will rise much more when other *factors* are considered
