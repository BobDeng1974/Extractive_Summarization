interview : dame @entity1 said she ate hash cakes at university and hallucinated earlier this week , @entity5 's top doctor called for a ban on smoking in parks - to set a better example for children			1
but yesterday , dame @entity1 spoke again about the time she ate hash cakes and hallucinated			2
the chief medical officer , who has previously admitted taking cannabis at university , blamed the bad experience which made her stop dabbling with the illegal drug on ' contaminants ' in an interview			1
her drug experience sparked guffaws from smokers ' group @entity20 who accused her of double standards and derided her notion of adults as role models			1
anti-drugs campaigners said her ' contamination ' comment was ' dangerous ' , ' careless ' and even ' nonsense '			1
they say the mind - altering chemical @entity33 in cannabis is more likely to make users hallucinate - as ' contaminated ' cannabis is practically unheard of			0
recalling the ' three or four times ' she ate hash cakes , @entity41 , 64 , said in the interview with the @entity44 newspaper yesterday : ' the last time there were contaminants in it and i had hallucinations			1
' the government 's most senior medical adviser first revealed she had tried cannabis baked into cookies while studying medicine at @entity55 in the late 1960s and early 1970s on @entity57 's private passions last year			1
on that occasion she said : ' i never smoked , so i could n't smoke joints , but i did have some cookies until on the third or fourth occasion i had hallucinations and i have never touched it since			0
i think i understood through that what my father said to me when i told him i was going to try it			0
he said drugs de-civilise you , you stop being a civilised person			0
' the mystery ' contaminants ' in her latest telling of the hash cake hallucinations incident has led to raised eyebrows among anti-drugs campaigners			1
@entity77 , chairman of drugs prevention charity @entity78 , said : ' it 's a careless thing to say			1
it implies contaminants are responsible for the hallucinations when it is more likely @entity33 was responsible			1
' to toss it off as ' contaminants ' is a throwaway remark that really could be quite dangerous			2
' cannabis is something that has never really been badly adulterated with anything else			0
i remember reading someone ground up glass and put it in cannabis a few years ago , but apart from that i have never read anything about it being contaminated			0
' it sounds most unusual			0
does she know what the contaminants were or who put them there ? did she eat a whole cookie instead of half this time ? she needs to answer that			2
' a @entity106 spokesman : ' people take cannabis because cannabis effects the brain and quite a few people do have a bad experience as a result , either short term or long term			1
' how could she know if it had contaminants in it ? did she have it analysed ? the whole thing is a nonsense			1
we would expect rather more rational comments from the chief medical officer			1
' in her wide - ranging @entity44 interview , @entity41 warned that since her student days ' cannabis has got much stronger and i worry about that			0
cannabis used by people whose brains are still developing , adolescents , is not a good idea , particularly in high doses			0
' a @entity106 spokesman said ' people take cannabis because cannabis effects the brain and quite a few people do have a bad experience as a result , either short term or long term			1
' she also told how ' the things that damage our health - whether it 's diet leading to obesity , smoking or addiction - are individual choices ' and said : ' i think it 's very important we do n't sidestep that by becoming a nanny state			2
' earlier this week she backed a plan for smoking to be outlawed in public parks in @entity161 , saying : ' we all know smoking is bad for health			2
so i welcome any measures to reduce both active smoking and its role - modelling in front of children			0
' campaigners have denounced the plan as an attack on civil liberties			2
yesterday @entity172 , director of the smokers ' group @entity20 , said : ' she was happy to eat hash cakes when she was young			1
now she wants to stop people smoking a legal product in the open air where there is no risk to anyone other than themselves			0
' the idea that adults have to be role models for the next generation is ridiculous			0
let today 's youth find their own way , just as @entity41 did when she was young			2
educate but do n't over-regulate			0
' unfortunately today 's public health industry is driven by control freaks like @entity41 who want to micro-manage our lives in a way they would never have accepted when they were young			2
' the dangers of long - term cannabis use , including mental health problems , were recently laid bare in a 20 - year study by professor @entity203 , a drugs advisor to the @entity205			0
he found cannabis doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders , including schizophrenia .			0
