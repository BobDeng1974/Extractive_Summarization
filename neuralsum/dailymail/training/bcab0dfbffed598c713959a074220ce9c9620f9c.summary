the @entity12 said the $ 60million figure is equivalent to the annual gross revenue of the football program			1
the money must be paid into an endowment for external programs preventing child sexual abuse or assisting victims and may not be used to fund such programs at @entity2			0
sadness : some of those gathered to watch the @entity12 announcement were stunned as the sanctions against @entity2 were revealed response : @entity2 students and others react as the @entity12 sanctions were announced ' @entity66 will never again be placed ahead of educating , nurturing and protecting young people , ' mr @entity19 said			2

' in the @entity2 case , the results were perverse and unconscionable			0
' @entity2 will also be forced to give up 20 scholarships each year for four years			0
earlier in the press conference , mr @entity19 said he had ' never seen anything as egregious ' as the horrific crimes of @entity9 and the efforts of head coach @entity31 and others at the university - including former @entity2 president @entity81 and athletic director @entity83 - to hide it			1

the conference announced that the university will not be allowed to share in the $ 13million bowl revenue during its postseason ban			0
instead , the @entity147 will donate the funds to charity			0
the @entity12 penalty also is worrisome for a region where the economy is built at least partially on the strength and popularity of the football program concern : @entity2 student @entity164 and others listen announcement of their school 's punishment in the wake of a child sex scandal staying or going ? current @entity2 football players , pictured on monday at the university , have been given the option to transfer to other schools @entity176 , a @entity2 senior and member of the dance team called the @entity180 , said an @entity12 death penalty would not only make football players transfer , but it also would force program changes for cheerleaders , dancers and band members , and would hurt season - ticket holders			1
' it could ruin everything that we 've built here , ' said @entity176 , from @entity191 , @entity192			0
added @entity193 , a 31 - year - old university construction project coordinator who grew up in the area : ' it 's going to kill our town			1

' but that honour ended with disgrace for @entity31 , who was fired in november after nearly 50 years of coaching			0

@entity31 coached the team for 46 years before he was fired last year at the height of the @entity9 case			1

police and construction workers barricaded both sides of the street and the sidewalks near the statue			0
in a statement on sunday morning , the @entity31 reacted to the removal of the statue , saying : ' tearing down the statue of @entity31 does not serve the victims of @entity9 's horrible crimes or help heal the @entity269			1
we believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth			0
' gone : the site outside @entity32 where @entity31 's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach reaction : some students and @entity282 residents could not contain their emotions as they saw @entity32 without the statue the family also chided the media for what they called one - sided reporting on a document that @entity31 is unable to defend himself against			1
' the @entity87 report , though it has been accepted by the media as the definitive conclusion on the @entity9 scandal , is the equivalent of an indictment - a charging document written by a prosecutor - and an incomplete and unofficial one at that			0
' @entity2 president @entity298 said @entity31 's name will remain on the campus library because it ' symbolizes the substantial and lasting contributions to the academic life and educational excellence that the @entity31 family has made to @entity14			1
' farewell : workers are seen carting away the covered statue of ex-penn state football coach @entity31 on sunday morning @entity307 , who was hired to replace @entity31 , now faces the task of building the team with severe limitations , and trying to keep current players from fleeing to other schools , which the @entity12 says they are free to do			1
star players such as tailback @entity314 and linebacker @entity315 are now essentially free agents			0
@entity307 said : ' i knew when i accepted the position that there would be tough times ahead			0
but i am committed for the long term to @entity2 and our student athletes			0
' last week , the group that runs the parking area dubbed ' @entity325 , ' where students camp out for tickets before games , stripped that title and changed the name to ' @entity331			0
' down and out : @entity2 president @entity298 said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because it ' has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing ' removing all traces : since a scathing report that detailed how much @entity31 knew about the child sex scandal , his name is being pulled from much of the school view more videos at : @entity344 .			2
