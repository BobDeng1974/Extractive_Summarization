by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam it took 72 minutes for @entity3 to get on the pitch in the @entity6 curtain - raiser			1
after six months and one @entity10 were wasted to injury , @entity8 ’s staff and supporters probably wo n’t mind waiting a little longer for a goal from their £ 53million striker			1
their unease is more likely to centre on whether they see much more of him at all , with the @entity19 reportedly close to a move to @entity21			2
that particular saga provided the main talking point before and during a 2 - 2 draw that occasionally thrilled but , more often , looked rather fittingly like a pre-season friendly			1
return : @entity3 featured in the second half as @entity8 drew 2 - 2 with @entity27 in the @entity6 lay off : the @entity19 missed the @entity10 through injury and has been linked with a move to @entity21 bow : @entity3 replaces @entity30 in the 72nd minute of @entity8 's draw with @entity27 familiar faces : @entity33 ( left ) , who scored an own goal , and @entity30 ( right ) in action for @entity8 @entity27 : @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 ( @entity42 70 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 70 ) , @entity45 ; @entity46 ( @entity47 46 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 60 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 60 )			1
goals : @entity33 ( og ) 37 , @entity49 70			0
@entity8 : @entity54 ; @entity55 ( @entity56 80 ) , @entity33 ( @entity57 70 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 60 ) ; @entity61 ( @entity62 60 ) , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 46 ) ; martial ( @entity66 60 ) , @entity30 ( @entity3 72 ) , @entity67			1
goals : @entity69 ( og ) 20 , @entity66 80			0
perhaps the biggest surprise was that the principality side in a financial bubble often looked so clueless against a @entity75 club that has seen much better days			0
with @entity3 on the bench , the mood in a largely empty @entity77 was subdued , almost as if @entity8 did n’t have £ 40m of talent in their midfield pairing of @entity63 and @entity82			1
sadly for those who did turn up , @entity8 initially played as if they did n’t have them , either			2
for the first half an hour , before taking the lead , @entity8 were ineffective			2
within eight minutes , @entity27 had them rattled , @entity41 releasing @entity88 down the right , with the full back crossing to @entity90 , who fired over			2
at the other end @entity30 sauntered and flicked , touched and dipped			2
he even tracked a few runs and his backheel to find @entity67 was typical			0
so was the booing each time the former @entity95 forward took possession			0
@entity27 had another good opportunity after quarter of an hour when @entity43 side - stepped @entity55 on the left and crossed to the far post			1
@entity46 , a fine player in this faded club , outjumped @entity58 but his pointblank header went straight at @entity54			0
on target : @entity49 scores @entity27 's second goal to give them the lead at the @entity77 @entity106 on the back : @entity49 is congratulated by team - mate @entity108 ( left ) after his goal on terms : @entity66 equalised 10 minutes from time to earn @entity8 a draw at that point @entity27 were cruising ; @entity8 sightseeing			1
but with 30 minutes played @entity63 , a £ 22m man , made a telling contribution , delivering the corner that @entity58 glanced via a @entity38 deflection beyond @entity40 on the line			0
the lead was harsh , but it only lasted seven minutes			0
@entity33 had the final touch , sliding and knocking into his own goal after @entity88 swept in a low cross from the right			0
@entity48 , once an unremarkable loan signing at @entity125 but now one of the brightest players in @entity27 ’s side , came close with a flick and shot early in the second half			2
but @entity27 were soon ahead when @entity49 finished from close range after @entity40 crossed from the left			0
@entity8 levelled with 10 minutes remaining , substitute @entity66 taking position in @entity27 ’s half and running at @entity69			1
the defender offered a sight of goal and @entity66 drilled a low shot past @entity36 from 20 yards			0
greetings : new @entity142 signing @entity140 ( right ) and his former @entity144 team - mate @entity3 ( left ) spectator : @entity142 midfielder @entity146 watches the opening game of the tournament scouting : @entity142 manager @entity149 ( right ) in the stands with @entity151 and @entity152			1

@entity19 , who missed @entity10 through injury , came on in 72nd minute
@entity3 replaced former @entity157 and @entity95 striker @entity30
@entity8 drew 2 - 2 with @entity27 in opening game of @entity6
each side *conceded* an own goal during draw at @entity142 's @entity77
