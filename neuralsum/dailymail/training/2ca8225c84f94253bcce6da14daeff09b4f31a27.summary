' you took this @entity3 which belonged to someone else , ' the judge told @entity7			1
' why you took it has not been explained			0
' you must have taken it for pure devilment , arrogantly believing you could drive it appropriately when you neither had the experience or the qualifications to do so , or not caring what might happen with you behind the wheel			0
' the road conditions were treacherous and while you drove it , the car was damaged			0
' tragic : mr @entity5 was walking to his local club in @entity53 , pictured , on a snowy saturday afternoon in january when he was hit by the vehicle mr @entity5 was walking to his local club in @entity56 ’s @entity53 on a snowy saturday afternoon in january when he was mown down			1

the judge said : ' the crash occurred when you were driving at a grossly excessive speed , some 70mph in a 30mph limit , in an attempt to evade the police with pedestrians on the pavement and other vehicles on the road			1
' the factors combined make what happened almost inevitable			0
' it was a ' ghastly irony ' that in sentencing the judge had to consider the young defendant ’s welfare ' when you had so little regard for the welfare of others that morning '			2

the judge lifted a reporting restriction naming @entity7 despite an argument from @entity157 , defending , that it would harm his rehabilitation			1
the judge said : ' what tips the balance in this case is the significance of this devastating incident in a small community such as @entity56			0
' while i have had due regard to the interests of this young defendant , the nature of the offence and its surrounding circumstances are such to make it in the public interest that full reporting take place			0
