defence cuts have left the @entity1 so short of engineers it has had to borrow some from the @entity4			2
this month , @entity6 servicemen will start work as engineering technicians on board @entity10 frigates on the south coast			1
if it is a success , there will be a total of 36 @entity16 personnel working in the positions in @entity18 by the end of 2016			1
the @entity1 's type 23 frigate @entity21 , moored in @entity22 the navy says it is bringing the engineers to the city because of cuts to staff numbers in the government 's @entity28			2
critics have called it a ' desperate move ' , saying it proves armed forces redundancies , which saw the loss of around 500 engineers in 2011 , are a false economy			1
former naval officer @entity38 , the publisher of maritime book @entity41 , said : ' having to borrow engineers is hugely embarrassing and bringing them across is a desperate move			1
' it is fortunate the @entity4 has excess personnel at the moment , after they have paid off some ships that were very manpower intensive			2
' you ca n't just recruit guys off the street and train them - the @entity1 is looking for experience			0
' but i 'm sure these guys will do a great job and keep ships at sea			0
' the project will cost the navy £ 187,000 from april 2014 to april 2015 , and the average pay for each engineer is £ 35,000			0
first class cadet @entity61 logs a reading in a ship engine room admiral lord @entity64 , a former head of the @entity1 , said he thought the move was a sensible one			1
he said : ' there is a national shortage of engineers in this country , and that is obviously going to affect the military as well			0
' i have served with a lot of @entity6 and they fit in extremely well			1
' this seems to me a good temporary measure but there does come a stage where we need more people in the navy			0
' the @entity1 said it is actively recruiting in all branches , including engineering			0
it is not uncommon for servicemen and women from other nations to serve on board @entity1 warships			1
the first sea lord admiral sir @entity91 welcomed the move , saying : ' the professional maritime partnership between the @entity6 and the @entity94 is one without equal			1
' this latest initiative strengthens its authority further still			2
' the @entity1 already enjoys a highly successful collaboration with the @entity4 as we fight the war on drugs together			0
' but this agreement takes our partnership to the next level - and beyond - and i warmly welcome that			0
' it is quite true that the @entity1 is under significant manpower pressure in key specialist skills to meet today 's commitments			0
' this is a recognised leadership and management challenge that is part and parcel of the @entity1 's renaissance			0
' we are working to meet that challenge , but also to chase the opportunities it offers , but i do not expect it to throw us off track			2
' the trial partnership will begin this month when four personnel come over from @entity6			1
another 16 will follow in 2015 and 16 more in 2016 , bringing the total to 36			1
the @entity1 already has a number of regular and ongoing exchanges with other foreign navies including the @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 .			0

@entity6 will start work on board @entity10 frigates later this month
four will come over to work in @entity18 for an initial trial period
plan is to have 36 working in the south coast town by end of 2016
critics called it a ' desperate move ' and labelled it a false economy
but some officers say it strengthens the bond between @entity94 and @entity6
