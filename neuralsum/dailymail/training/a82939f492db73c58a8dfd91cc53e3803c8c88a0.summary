by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 07:40 est , 17 january 2014 a 44 - year - old @entity3 man who could n't even speak without gasping for breath is now breathing normally after having his lungs washed out with 30 liters of fluid			1
@entity7 , 44 , was diagnosed late last year with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis , or @entity9 , in which surfectant builds up in the air sacs of the lungs			1
the treatment is a procedure called lung lavage during which doctors washed his lungs , one at a time , with a saline solution			1
finally , just before @entity37 , he was found by doctors at the @entity39 to be suffering from @entity9 , a condition that 's hard to diagnose and is often mistaken for sarcoidosis			2
according to @entity7 's doctors , the initial misdiagnosis of sarcoidosis was exacerbating his condition			2
the immune suppressant and anti-inflammatory drugs were in fact making him more susceptible to infection			0
after his most recent bout with pneumonia , @entity7 found himself barely able to stand or speak without becoming winded			2
the engineer was still dragging himself to work every day but was surviving on oxygen tanks			0
' i had absolutely no energy ... during that time , i would go from my bed to my desk at work to bed , ' he told @entity58			0
specialized procedure : a doctor secures one of the many bags of fluid that was run through @entity7 's clogged lungs good vibration : @entity7 can be seen with a chest percussor strapped to him , which vibrated his chest as the fluid was pumped through them ' several people told me , after the fact , that they were not sure i would make it through			1
to quote my wife , " i was on death ’s doorstep			0
" ' @entity7 , a father of two boys aged 21 and 14 , had given up on any activities outside of work and sleep			2
after doctors at the @entity80 diagnosed @entity81 , @entity7 underwent lung lavage , a treatment that 's used exclusively for @entity9			1
according to @entity58 , @entity7 was fitted with a chest percussor , a vest that shook his chest			2
doctors intubated him , washing one lung at a time so that @entity7 could breathe with the other one			1
the saline solution was pumping into his lungs , cleaning out the excess surfectant from his air sacs			1
@entity94 is protein and lipid material			0
' normal surfactant keeps the airways open , ' dr @entity97 told @entity58			0
life savers : dr @entity97 ( left ) performed the lung - washing procedure while dr @entity102 ( right ) finally gave @entity7 the correct diagnosis for his condition first wash : one of the medical team drains fluid from @entity7 's lung into a bottle fresh start : the first liters of liquid were cloudy with surfectant that had built up in @entity7 's air sacs ' the blood that comes through the thin walls exchange with the air and that ’s how we get oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide			1
the altered surfactant protein makes this wall very thick , so the air does n’t exchange well			0
there is a lack of oxygenation , and the patient becomes short of breath and fatigues quickly , and is barely able to leave the house			0
' over the course of successive washes , the liquid slowly turned from cloudy , milky , off - white to clear			0
it took 30 liters of water to clean @entity7 's lungs			1
the procedure can only be performed by a highly trained surgeon and a team made up of a radiologist , anesthesiologist and pathologist			0
breathing easy : the fluid flushed through @entity7 's lungs went from cloudy to clear as his air sacs were cleaned out family man : @entity7 ( pictured with his family ) can start doing some of his favorite activities again , such as coaching kids sports @entity7 says the result was nothing short of a miracle			1
' i had the lavage thursday , and on friday i felt well enough to drive myself home , ' he told @entity58			0
@entity7 may go into complete remission from he disease , or he may require further lung - washing			1
the doctor who diagnosed @entity7 's condition correctly , dr @entity102 , is very hopeful for @entity7 's future			1
' he is a wonderful person , ' she told @entity58			0
' he was still going to work on a huge amount of oxygen and did n’t want to give up			0
... there are days we [ doctors ] get discouraged dealing with very complex cases , but people like @entity7 give me hope and make me happy about what i am doing			2
