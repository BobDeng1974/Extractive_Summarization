by @entity0 the picture , of four @entity3 officials meeting a 103 - year - old woman in her home , was probably meant to convey the impression of a government in touch with the masses			1
the image , from @entity11 in eastern @entity3 , even bore the caption : ' @entity13 and consideration for the elderly is a cherished @entity3 tradition			1
they should feel the warmth of the party and the government			0
' however , the media stunt backfired spectacularly as the image was an ineptly edited montage that exposed all involved to ridicule from @entity3 's increasingly vocal online commentators			1
utterly bizarre : this poorly manipulated image was released by @entity3 officials keen to highlight their concern for the elderly a close - up of the manipulated area			2
the woman looks like a doll and the officials torso hovers in mid-air four grinning men tower above centenarian @entity37 , who has obviously been edited into the photo from another image but appears almost doll - sized			2
one of the party officials has been chopped off at the thigh to incorporate the image , leaving him bizarrely hanging in mid-air			0
@entity3 users of @entity47 , a micro-blog site , were not impressed			2
' the brainless propaganda staff will probably be sacked along with these officials , ' said one			0
another added : ' this picture really shows the distance between leaders and commoners in the eyes of your average government official			2
' another photo of the visit : the government has apologised for the picture , saying the photographer had struggled to get everyone at the event into the frame even @entity67 , @entity3 ’s official news agency , put the boot in			1
' the officials appear to be floating in the air			0
in addition the woman ’s proportions do not match those of the officials indicating that the photo may have been faked , ' it reported			0
officials told @entity79 that they had visited centenarians during a @entity3 festival , but an employee had merged two shots because the layout of the room had prevented the photographer from capturing the woman and the officials in the same frame			1
' @entity37 was sitting on a chair on the balcony , under the sun. the balcony space was very small and the camera lens could not cover the whole scene … when the employee of the municipal civil affairs department uploaded the photos … he simply merged two shots , ' the government said			0
' we express deep regret to internet users for its negative influence … we will learn from the experience , to improve civil affairs work			0
' photoshopped : this clearly doctored picture , published last year , showed three @entity3 officials proudly showing off their newly laid road spoof : a number of viral pictures have appeared around the world showing the three @entity3 officials in various locations			1

government photo *attracts* withering comments from @entity3 's bloggers
a woman is *appallingly* photoshopped into corner of picture , appearing tiny
one blogger called the *incident* ' very sad and depressing '
