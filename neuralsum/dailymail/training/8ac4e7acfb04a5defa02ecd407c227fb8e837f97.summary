by @entity0 published : 02:44 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 03:14 est , 17 may 2013 @entity1 apologised for ' liking ' the photograph of the boy , who was 16 at the time an @entity7 politician says he has learned a valuable lesson in social networking after he ' liked ' a @entity11 photo without realising that it showed a teenage prankster exposing himself			1
@entity1 , the @entity14 education minister , said he clicked the ' like ' button under what he thought was an innocent photo of the then - 16 - year - old in late 2011			1
@entity1 apologised yesterday and said he had no idea that the teen , who was otherwise fully clothed and posing alongside an older man , was playing a prank commonly known as ' sneaky nuts '			2
' at first glance it appeared to be a harmless picture , ' @entity1 said in a statement			2
' it was a silly mistake on my part			0
i only became aware of the actual content of the photo when shown by a journalist today			0
' this obviously highlights the pitfalls of social media			0
i apologise if i caused any offence			0
' the stunt was popularised by @entity7 comedian @entity40 's tv show angry boys , in which a character revels in ruining group photos by secretly exposing himself			1
the prank has been a headache for some educators : last year , administrators at a catholic school in @entity48 scrambled to place stickers over a photo printed in all 1,300 class yearbooks of a student subtly exposing his genitals			0
the @entity14 incident did not attract attention until late last month , when the teen bragged on @entity57 about fooling @entity1 , who he was friends with on @entity11			2
the ' sneaky nuts ' prank was popularized by comedian @entity40 in his tv show @entity59			1
