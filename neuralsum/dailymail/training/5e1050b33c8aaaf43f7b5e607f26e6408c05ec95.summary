by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 11:14 est , 1 october 2012 a miniature donkey , born with a deformed leg , is thriving after being fitted with one of the first prosthetic limbs to be created by equine surgeons			1
the young foal named @entity0 had her hind leg amputated at just two days old because it stopped her from standing			1
but she is now enjoying a new lease of life after vets at @entity12 , @entity13 , managed to create a special artificial leg for her , similar to those used by @entity18 athletes			1
she is now on her second prosthesis and experts predict she will need about seven different legs before she reaches adulthood			0
dr @entity30 , an assistant professor in the @entity31 and equine surgeon at the university , performed the procedure and is working with clinician @entity35 from @entity36			2
the clinic is part of the same company which created a prosthetic tail for @entity41 , the amputee dolphin and star of the film ‘ @entity50 ’ , who lost her tail after she was caught in a crab trap off the coast of @entity49			2
thanks to the artificial limb @entity0 can run around and jump like the rest of the group she was fitted with the pink prosthesis after surgeons amputated her severely deformed leg which stopped her from walking @entity58 trainer @entity57 with @entity41 the dolphin , who was fitted with a prosthetic tail by the same company who fitted @entity0 the miniature donkey with an artificial limb the two worked out a plan to allow @entity0 time to heal from the surgery and transition from her cast to the prosthesis			1
dr @entity30 said : ‘ once we proceeded with the surgery and amputated the distal limb , he provided a small footplate to incorporate into the cast to even out the length of her hind limbs so she could bear weight until we could get the surgical site healed and have her fitted with a prosthesis			2
‘ it has been a group effort on behalf of many caring individuals willing to go to great lengths to save her			0
’ @entity0 's case is providing a unique teaching opportunity for the clinicians involved , as the practice of using prostheses with large horses is relatively uncommon due to size and weight - bearing limitations			1
but because @entity0 is a miniature donkey , even as an adult she will only weigh approximately 350 pounds once fully grown			1
a team of doctors and surgeons from @entity12 , @entity13 , carefully fit @entity0 with her latest prosthesis the veterinary team are excited at @entity0 's progress since she was fitted with the prosthetuic limb - which could soon be an option for all horses dr @entity30 added : ‘ she absolutely loved it from the start			1
it was a very impressive design and she did very well in it			0
a close - up of @entity0 's first prosthetic limb which has enabled her to run ‘ she has progressed to the second iteration of her prosthesis , which does n't incorporate as much of the limb and allows her more range of motion			1
she is getting stronger ; she 's growing and doing wonderfully			0
’ the prosthesis is made of carbon fibre , @entity118 and fibreglass , materials that are strong and extremely light , and the same as though used for prostheses for @entity18 athletes			0
the first finished prosthesis weighed less than a pound and the most recent iteration , which is pink , is smaller , but weighs a little more to provide stability as she 's grown taller and almost doubled her weight since surgery			0
prosthesis expert @entity35 said : ‘ the next step is trying to make sure we keep the prosthesis set up so she 's ambulatory and she can run and play and do things uninhibited , but also , to keep the area of concern , the surgical site , offloaded so dr @entity30 can do his job in keeping her completely healed			0
‘ as time goes by , we 'll continue to provide a prosthesis that 's going to allow for growth			0
‘ we want to provide her with full range of motion , but also give her the ability to use full strength			0
’ dr @entity30 added : ‘ it 's been very educational for me as an equine surgeon to learn ; this has certainly been my first case			0
‘ i think we have a long way to go before we get to this being a procedure that 's routinely an option for our larger patients , but for a prosthetic limb to be an option in horses is something that 's pretty exciting			2
’ @entity0 has no problem grazing alongside the other ponies and horses in the field following the efforts of her veterinary team			1

@entity0 the miniature donkey was born with a deformed leg which had to be amputated
the artificial leg is one of the first to be created by equine surgeons
it could spark the start of prosthetic limbs becoming available for all horses
