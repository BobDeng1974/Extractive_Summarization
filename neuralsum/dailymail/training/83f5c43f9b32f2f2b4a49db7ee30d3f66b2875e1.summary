by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:21 pm on 27th december 2011 whip - crack smart in a tweed jacket and tie – and with a cheery wave for well - wishers – the @entity7 finally left hospital yesterday after heart surgery			1
only the 90 - year - old royal ’s slightly pallid complexion hinted at the ordeal he had been through since developing chest pains at @entity14 the day before @entity15			2
still , it was hard to believe the @entity18 ’s notoriously robust husband had undergone such an operation for a man of his age just five days earlier			2
i 'm fine ! with a wave to reporters , prince @entity7 was driven away from @entity25 to rejoin the @entity26 at @entity14 the @entity7 seemed pleased to be leaving hospital after receiving treatment for a blocked artery festive cheer : the @entity7 appeared delighted to be able to rejoin his family departing from @entity25 in @entity34 shortly before 9.30am in a chauffeur - driven @entity35 , royal sources said prince @entity7 was relieved to be going home but ‘ immensely ’ grateful for everything medical staff had done for him			1
the @entity18 was , by all accounts , eagerly awaiting his return , having last seen him on @entity15			2
it did n’t take the duke long to get back in the party mood			2
just hours after arriving back at the royal country retreat , he joined members of the @entity26 at a shooting party lunch			0
the family ate together at @entity51 in @entity52 , which is situated on the estate and often used as an informal weekend retreat by the royals			0
prince @entity7 was seen sitting in the front seat of a @entity57 as he was driven away from the farmhouse at 1.45pm to return to the main house			1
meanwhile the rest of the party returned to the pheasant shoot			1
in a statement @entity63 said : ‘ @entity7 was discharged from @entity25 this morning			1
he is returning to @entity14 by car			0
he is very much looking forward to rejoining his family			0
’ on departure , prince @entity7 thanked the staff at @entity25 for the excellent care he has received during his stay			1
arriving at the @entity18 ’s private estate in @entity71 , some 60 miles away , @entity7 again smiled and waved at bystanders			1
the driver appeared to deliberately slow down to allow the elderly royal to be photographed – as if the prince wanted well - wishers to see what a remarkable recovery he had made			0
an estate worker said : ‘ the prince could easily have arrived at a different entrance to avoid being seen , but he instead went through the normal gate where he knew he would be seen			0
’ most members of the @entity26 are thought to have remained on the estate to welcome back @entity7 , although @entity85 and his wife @entity86 and their two children departed just ten minutes before his arrival			1
health scare : prince @entity7 had been in @entity25 since christmas eve arrival : as prince @entity7 arrived at @entity14 he looked tired and weak dressed to impress : at her first @entity91 of @entity92 looked elegant in a simple maroon outfit by a @entity95 designer , while the @entity18 wore a lavender coat with a glittering diamond and pearl brooch on the way to the church : ( left to right ) prince @entity1 , prince @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , prince @entity104 , prince @entity105 , and @entity106 , @entity107 made their way to the service while prince @entity7 recovers in hospital a pheasant shoot also began on the 20,000 acre estate around 15 minutes before the duke turned up			1
a keen shot even now , @entity7 was desperately disappointed to have missed the traditional shoot this year but did attend the lunch			1
the queen ’s husband was airlifted to @entity25 on friday night after he complained of chest pains			0
following tests , doctors discovered a blocked artery and inserted a small surgical stent to open it up and restore the blood flow to his heart			1
although the procedure is relatively common and considered ‘ minimally invasive ’ , doctors were taking no chances given his age and kept the prince in hospital for four nights – much to the notoriously grumpy royal ’s displeasure			0
the incident is the most serious health scare suffered by the duke since he was hospitalised with a serious chest infection in 2008			0
@entity7 has always enjoyed good health and , according to those who work with him , still possesses the energy of a man half his age			2
his busy public schedule sees him carrying out up to 350 official engagements each year			2
in the last 12 months he has also been on two gruelling foreign tours with the @entity18 , to @entity148 and @entity149 , and next year is due to accompany her on a nationwide @entity152 tour			0
despite the setback he is said to be in ‘ good spirits ’			0
aides admit , however , they can not be sure how quickly he will resume public engagements or even whether he would attend church on sunday as usual			1
festive gift : her majesty receives flowers from well - wishers following the @entity164 church service			0

@entity7 left with a grin and a wave as he was finally released
he was said to be disappointed to miss @entity172 pheasant shoot
@entity174 was placed into his heart to keep artery open and reduce the pain
no *decision* taken on how soon the @entity7 will resume public engagements
