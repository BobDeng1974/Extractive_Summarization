by @entity0 published : 15:25 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 10 december 2013 after their high street 's christmas tree was dubbed the worst in @entity5 , residents of @entity2 were left feeling a little less festive than others			1
so , in a bid to restore the community 's @entity10 spirit , a local pub landlord decided to put up his own fir near the council 's effort , which has been likened to ' an upside down cornet '			1
but within hours of erecting the improved tree , council officials were on site to tear it down after branding it a ' health and safety hazard			1
with the help of some local children , the 26 - year - old decided to put up a real @entity10 fir , complete with tinsel , baubles and beads			1
the 26 - year - old was among countless residents who were left red - faced by the council 's effort but despite being admired by customers at the @entity45 , the tree was swiftly taken away on the back of a jcb by council workers who deemed it ' dangerous '			1
mr @entity22 said : ' a bar worker saw the council workers driving away with the tree and she called me			2
' she was too late to do anything about it , as they were already leaving when she saw them			0
' though the pub was open at the time , mr @entity22 claims no one bothered to tell staff the tree was to be removed			0
' when i rang the council i was told that it had blown over and that it was a health and safety hazard , ' he added			1
the landlord was n't the only local resident who was left red - faced by the council 's ' tree ' which was likened to a dunce 's hat and wigwam by passers - by			1
' it 's not good for the town to get such publicity , i wanted to do something positive			0
' i am devastated , i do n't understand why they could not have just spoken to me about it			0
' ' it meant a lot to me , i was running round trying to sort out the buying of the tree while by partner was in hospital with our newborn baby			0
' mr @entity22 has even offered to gift the tree to the council so they can put it back up , but is waiting for a response			2
@entity92 has said it received a report that the tree had blown over - and that workers took it away on monday morning ' while making efforts to establish who owns it			2
' the council has since tweeted that it is talking to mr @entity22 , but did not indicate whether the tree would be reinstated			0
@entity101 : @entity22 is ' devastated ' that the council removed his @entity10 tree councillor @entity104 , leader of @entity92 , said : ' the tree was blown over during the early hours , narrowly missing a passer - by			2
' thankfully nobody was injured but i think the @entity109 footage speaks for itself really â€“ this is not a case of the council overreacting , more a case of being sensible in light of the windy conditions			0
' our staff recovered the tree after a report that it had been propped up against a barrier			0
' ' embarrassment ' : residents were horrified by the council 's white , cone - shaped christmas tree @entity92 was not available for a comment this evening			1
last week the town 's tree was lambasted as the country 's worst , with critics comparing it to an upside down cornet and dunce 's hat			2
local residents were dismayed by the effort , with some saying they would take their children and grandchildren elsewhere to see the @entity10 lights being switched on .			0
