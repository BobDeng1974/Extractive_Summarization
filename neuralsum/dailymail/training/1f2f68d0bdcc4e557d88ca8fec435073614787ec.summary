@entity1 's form at @entity2 is coming under increasing scrutiny at the highest level of the club after he was sent off during the 2 - 1 home defeat against @entity7			1
@entity1 , one of the highest - paid players in the @entity9 on £ 225,000 a week , has yet to rediscover the form that fired @entity2 to the title last season			1
the midfielder , who scored @entity2 ’s equaliser from a free - kick at the @entity16 on wednesday night , was later sent off for stupidly shoving @entity17 in the face			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity1 is sent off by @entity21 referee @entity20 against @entity7 on wednesday night chairman @entity22 ( left ) and chief executive @entity23 watch on on wednesday night @entity1 is upended by @entity7 's @entity25 international midfielder @entity24 @entity1 lands awkwardly as a foul is given by the @entity21 referee for the foul by @entity29 @entity1 put in a performance at the @entity16 despite his sublime early free - kick to equalise @entity1 , 31 , has since apologised to @entity2 supporters , but he appears disaffected at the club			1
he has a contract until 2017 and has one of the biggest bonus packages in the history of @entity39 football in his contract			0
he is paid £ 823,000 each time @entity2 qualify for the @entity42 and an extra £ 412,000 if they win it			0
that clause is unlikely to be activated any time soon , as the @entity9 champions lie bottom of their group without a win			0
@entity50 ’s transfer strategy is also coming under increasing scrutiny from @entity2 ’s billionaire owner @entity52			2
@entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 are among the expensive imports who are struggling to justify their massive salaries and transfer fees			0
@entity54 , who again did not start for @entity2 , jogs off the pitch after being red - carded on wednesday night @entity50 has plenty of questions to answer after @entity2 remained winless in @entity65 this season			1

@entity2 on *brink* of @entity69 exit after no wins in four matches
@entity1 and @entity54 were both sent off against @entity7
city boss @entity50 left with plenty of questions to answer
