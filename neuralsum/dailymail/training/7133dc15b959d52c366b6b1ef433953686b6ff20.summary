for years they have been a source of joy for youngsters playing in their gardens			2
but now safety experts have called for a crackdown on trampolines – because they cause too many injuries			1
officials say only one child at a time should use the devices in a bid to cut the number of people requiring hospital treatment after crashing into each other or falling awkwardly			1
new figures show trampolines account for nearly 50 per cent of @entity21 admissions for injuries in the home among those aged under 14			2
‘ if you have a lot of people on the trampoline and they crash into each other you can get concussions and some nasty fractures , ’ said @entity40 , of the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , which compiled the statistics			0
‘ we also know if you have a safety net , parents tend to get complacent about safety and that ’s when you get more horseplay and serious incidents			0
’ @entity41 compiled detailed records from @entity21 departments in @entity59 over 15 months to get a snapshot of how people suffer injuries			1
two - thirds of the 64,000 patients treated were hurt in the home			0
of sports injuries at home , 54.9 per cent of girls and 38 per cent of boys were injured by playing on a trampoline			2
mr @entity40 warned that children suffered the worst injuries while bouncing on the trampoline at the same time as an adult , adding : ‘ when the adult has bounced and the trampoline is going back up and rising as the little one is coming down it ’s as if they ’ve just jumped out of a first floor window			1
’ shocking : more youngsters are likely to end up in hospital after using one of the bouncy toys than skateboarding , rollerblading or playing football at home ( file image ) sales of trampolines – which often cost less than £ 100 – have soared to more than one million in the @entity90 in recent years			1
doctors in @entity92 have called for them to be banned due to the number of casualties there			1
however , @entity41 does not want to see that happen in the @entity90 and is instead working with manufacturers on new safety measures			0
‘ we want people to continue to have fun but in as safe a way as possible , ’ said mr @entity40			0
‘ one of the things we are exploring is if we could have a target in the sweet spot of the trampoline which makes it clear you can only really have one person on it			0
as soon as you have two people you are going to get children crashing into each other or one being thrown off			0

more youngsters end up in hospital after trampolining than skateboarding
children suffer worst injuries when bouncing at same time as an adult
chance of injury increases if there is more than one child on trampoline
doctors in @entity92 have called for them to be banned due to casualties
