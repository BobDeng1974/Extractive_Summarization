babies born in the land - locked nation of just 8million are the ' luckiest ' in the world according to researchers who also named @entity12 as the worst place to start life			1
@entity14 is ranked just 27th , behind the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , and well down on the 7th place it achieved in a similar survey 25 years ago			1
wish you were there ? @entity5 has been named the best place to be born in 2013 in a study by the @entity25 , scoring countries out of a maximum of 10 from what today ’s newborns can hope to earn in 2030 to how happy a nation is , analysts from the @entity25 crunched the numbers on 11 different factors to decide where the luckiest babies will emerge this year			1
@entity5 tops the chart , scoring 8.22 out of 10 , jumping from 13th place in a similar exercise in 1988			1
the league table has been branded ‘ deadly serious ’ by @entity41 magazine , which suggests place of birth will become increasingly important as the world faces an uncertain future			2
‘ there is surely a lot to be said for boring stability in today ’s ( and no doubt tomorrow ’s ) uncertain times , ’ the magazine said			0
something in the air : small mountainous countries like @entity5 ( left ) and @entity53 were highly ranked in the list of the nations newborns were luckiest to call home the @entity58 has fallen from the number one spot in 1988 to joint 16th while @entity61 , ranked second in 1988 , drops to 26th , just ahead of @entity14			1
@entity62 is second and @entity53 third , followed by @entity63 and @entity64			1
@entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 complete the top 10			0
the results of opinion polls on how happy people say there have been cross-referenced with hard facts like crime levels , wealth and health , to produce the table			0
hard luck : babies born in @entity14 this year are less lucky than those in @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity84 , the study found putting the @entity14 at 27th in the world the @entity25 , a sister company of @entity41 , used 11 statistically significant indicators , including geography , demography , social and cultural characteristics , public policy , the state of the world economy and future income per head			1
the league table ‘ earnestly attempts to measure which country will provide the best opportunities for a healthy , safe and prosperous life in the years ahead ’ , @entity41 said			0
the study found people are living longer around the world while political freedoms have continued to spread , notably in north @entity102 and the @entity103 as the @entity104 takes hold			0
but family and community life has been hard hit in areas where unemployment has grown			0
in 1988 a similar study by the @entity25 put the @entity58 top of the global league table ‘ small economies dominate the top ten			2
half of these are @entity115 , but only one , the @entity67 , is from the euro zone , ’ @entity41 said			0
‘ the @entity119 countries shine , whereas the crisis - ridden south of @entity115 ( @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 ) lags behind despite the advantage of a favourable climate			0
the largest @entity115 economies ( @entity128 , @entity61 and @entity14 ) do not do particularly well			2
‘ @entity58 , where babies will inherit the large debts of the boomer generation , languishes back in 16th place			2
despite their economic dynamism , none of the @entity137 countries ( @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 ) scores impressively			0
among the 80 countries covered , @entity12 comes last : it is the worst place for a baby to enter the world in 2013			1
’ the 1988 study , while also carried out by the @entity25 , was not entirely serious			0
it included a philistine factor for cultural poverty and a yawn factor to measure how boring a country was , which marked @entity5 score badly on both .			2

new index names @entity5 babies as the ' luckiest ' in the world
@entity62 , @entity53 , @entity63 and @entity64 also in top 5
@entity14 languishing at 27th , down from 7th in a similar survey in 1988
