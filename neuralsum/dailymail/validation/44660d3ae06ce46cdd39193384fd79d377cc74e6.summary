more than 100 @entity1 hospitals in @entity2 contain fast food outlets , shocking new figures have revealed			1
critics argue the presence of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis			1
there are 128 outlets in @entity2 hospitals selling junk food , plus a further 32 branches of @entity17 , which sells confectionery - often at a discounted price			1
@entity22 's in @entity23 operates a food court with a @entity7 ( pictured ) there are also dozens of coffee shops - with 27 @entity27 and 92 @entity28 ( such as this one at the @entity29 in @entity30 ) - selling calorie - laden treats the fast food branches include two @entity33 , six @entity34 and one @entity9 , an investigation by @entity36 revealed			1
there are also dozens of coffee shops selling calorie - laden food and drink - with 27 @entity27 and 92 @entity28			2
this is in addition to all the smaller , independent retailers in hospitals selling junk food			1
the news comes as figures from @entity47 show that in @entity2 , 64 per cent of adults are either overweight or obese			1
and experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the @entity1 around £ 6 billion every year - or five per cent of the entire @entity1 budget			1
it spends a further £ 10billion on diabetes			0
to make matters worse , some of the @entity57 's major hospitals have more than one outlet selling junk food			1
@entity22 's in @entity23 operates a food court with a @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity27 and pizzeria , while and @entity63 also hosts a @entity7 and a @entity8 shop			2
earlier this month , it emerged the @entity9 bakery at the @entity67 in @entity68 , is the fast - food chain 's second busiest outlet in @entity2 earlier this month it was reported that the @entity9 bakery based in an @entity1 hospital is the fast - food chain 's second busiest outlet in @entity2			1
the counter at @entity67 in @entity68 is often so busy selling steak bakes , bacon rolls and pizzas that ropes have to be used to separate queues of hungry customers which can reach 20 people deep			2
the @entity36 investigation found customers could buy four sausage rolls for £ 2.40 , each which contained 25g fat			0
the total recommended daily amount of fat is 75g for women and 90g for men			0
those with a sweet tooth could buy three sugar and fat laiden doughnuts for £ 1			0
however a spokesman denied the hospital branch was the chain 's second biggest outlet			0
she said : ' there has been a @entity9 shop at @entity67 for over 10 years			0
' while popular with customers and providing a wide variety of products , this shop is not @entity9 ’ second busiest shop			0
' critics argue the presence of @entity7 ( pictured in @entity22 's hospital ) , @entity8 and @entity9 around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis but @entity111 , chief executive of @entity112 , said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain 's second busiest			1
he said : ' there is a cafe in site that sells all healthy food but it gets nowhere near the footfall that @entity9 gets			0
' you can understand the appeal			0
' earlier this week , mps called for a ban on fast - food outlets such as @entity128 ’s and @entity7 from hospitals			1
the move is part of several measures to tackle the growing number of @entity2 who are becoming dangerously overweight			2
as fast - food concessions come up for renewal , hospitals should demand healthier , tastier , affordable alternatives , experts say the report on the impact of physical activity and diet on health endorses the views of professor @entity145 , an expert in public health at @entity147			1
she states that hospitals are being negligent by allowing such firms to operate in places that promote good health			0
in her evidence to mps , she said : ' it is at best anomalous - and at worst negligent - that @entity1 properties continue to serve foods high in sugar , fat and salt , as exemplified by @entity160 and @entity7 outlets in some of our most prestigious hospitals , including @entity164 in @entity165 and @entity22 ’s hospital in @entity23			1
' @entity167 , the chief executive of @entity168 , backed the @entity153 ’ call and criticised hospitals for permitting the sale of fast food			1
he said : ' the @entity1 is being pennywise but pound - foolish selling junk food that ultimately just lands more people in hospital with expensive , preventable , obesity - driven illnesses			1
' so as these fast - food concessions come up for renewal , hospitals should demand healthier , tastier , affordable alternatives			1
' the chain sells a range of sandwiches , pies and pasties - such as the cheese and bacon wrap , a chicken fajita slice , and beef and vegetable pasties - ranging from 300 calories to almost 600			0
the hospital trust has joined forces with @entity194 to tackle the obesity crisis locally			1
but mr @entity111 said banning the chain from the site would not solve anything			0
he said : ' people say " ban the fast - food places " but i do n't think that will ever work			2
we have to change people 's mentality regarding the food they eat			0
' in @entity208 , hospital chiefs have told staff not to allow deliveries from a new @entity211 - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park			0
the move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of @entity217 in @entity218			0
staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant , with bosses steering them towards ' healthier ' sandwiches in the hospital 's smoothie bar instead			1
and a hospital in @entity227 has came under fire when it emerged it had paid £ 24,000 to close a @entity7 branch inside its own walls			0
@entity231 had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years , sparking the ire of health campaigners			1
it finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a @entity8 branch			0
but in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £ 24,000 to @entity57 , the company operating the fast food franchise			1
@entity246 admitted the ' world had changed ' since it signed the original deal in 1997			0
the news comes after the @entity1 announced last week that 700,000 overweight staff will be told to take part in free slimming classes to shed the pounds , in order to set a better example to their patients			2
the drastic scheme could help nearly half of @entity168 's 1.3 million workforce , who currently struggle with their weight			0
in a drive to ' practice what we preach ' , the @entity1 will sign employees up to one of three slimming classes , depending on the amount of weight they have to lose			2
staff will be put on personal eating plans and be offered cognitive behavioural therapy to help reassess their relationship with food			0
@entity168 chief executive @entity167 , who announced today 's initiative , said : ' today the @entity1 is starting to practice what we preach - helping our own staff get healthier and prevent illness			2
dr @entity282 , an @entity1 consultant specialising in weight loss surgery , says the @entity1 is contributing to the obesity crisis coffee shops offering sugar - laden drinks and cakes to hospital patients , visitors and @entity1 staff should be banned , a leading weight loss surgeon has said			1
dr @entity282 , an @entity1 consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery , said she no longer shakes the hands of her patients - more often than not because they arrive clutching a @entity8 take - out			2
in the place of these popular coffee shops and fast food outlets , dr @entity297 - who works at @entity298 and @entity299 - has called for restaurants and cafes championing local food producers and offering healthy and tasty snacks			1
' we read every week , in the bmj and other leading medical journals , of research detailing the perils of sugar and fizzy drinks , ' said dr @entity297			0
' we frequently hear laments about the cost to the @entity1 of the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes , which is threatening to engulf us			2
' and yet , the @entity1 , which i understood to be an organisation that promotes and supports health ( rather than just treating disease ) , is actually contributing to the problem			2
' as a weight loss surgeon , i find it frustrating and , frankly , embarrassing to spend time in clinic , explaining to my patients how sugary drinks and snacks are one of the biggest drivers of obesity , when i know that just outside in our hospital foyer are not one , but two costa coffee shops , as well as vending machines stocked full of coke and chocolate			2
' when i try to grab a quick coffee from @entity8 , an obedient employee always tries to tempt me into buying one of their huge , sugar - laden and calorific cakes to go with it ... hard to resist after a stressful morning in theatre or a busy night on - call			0
' if i did need a snack , i would be hard pushed to find much that you could describe as healthy — there is very little fresh , nutrient - rich food and next to nothing that does n't involve a load of refined carbs .			0
