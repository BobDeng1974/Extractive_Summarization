by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 6 july 2013 in its heyday it attracted two million visitors a year			0
but the iconic amusement park at the seaside resort of @entity6 shut in 2006 as crowds ebbed away , enticed by more glamorous locations			1
the seafront site has been an amusement park in one form or another since 1874 when ' lord ' @entity12 opened his menagerie at the ' @entity15 '			1
not so scenic : the rollercoaster was damaged in a fire in 2008 and stands neglected and partially dismantled in need of a makeover : although home to @entity22 's oldest rollercoaster @entity23 could not maintain its charm for visitors and closed in 2006 decline : the cinema - first looking faded and then in scaffolding - would be restored in the second phase of the costly redevelopment revival : the @entity30 has been granted £ 10m from the government 's @entity32 fund to re-open @entity23 as heritage - themed amusement park unloved : the 16 - acre site includes a theme park , amusements , a 2,200 seat cinema and a shopping arcade that dominates @entity6 's seafront @entity12 's grade ii - listed menagerie cages are believed to be the last of their kind remaining			1
the site contains the @entity22 's oldest rollercoaster , a grade ii * - listed structure from 1920 called the @entity47 , and a 2,200 - seat grade ii * listed cinema building developed in 1935			2
the @entity47 rollercoaster today stands neglected and partially dismantled in the ruins of the old park after it was damaged by a fire in 2008			1
@entity54 : one of @entity22 's premier seaside destinations , @entity6 is down - at - heel and waiting for redevelopment at the moment derelict : designer @entity59 said the restored park would be for people of all ages to enjoy when it hopefully opens next year @entity64 coast : an aerial view of @entity23 , showing the gaping empty space on the seafront however , there are already signs that @entity6 's fortunes are looking up			1
of all the holiday resorts in the world , @entity6 reached seventh place in the @entity75 ’s ' must see ' destinations for 2013			2
the @entity76 on the seafront has already brought in almost a million visitors since it opened just over two years ago			0
there are also new shops and boutique hotels , particularly near the attractive @entity82			0
@entity83 took on the town 's shop - owners and tried to breathe new life into the town 's retail sector for her show @entity90 , @entity91			0
@entity59 , the creative force behind the @entity30 , says that if their legal battle is successful the first phase of renovations will cost some £ 10 million			0
was n't it fun : the @entity47 , the world 's first rollercoaster , opened in 1920 but today stands delapidated innocent age : resorts such as @entity6 have lost out as tourists have travelled to more glamorous and warmer locations downward slide : @entity23 's fortunes had been declining for years before the site 's closure in 2006 that will include restoring the @entity47 , the historic rides collections and the original menagerie cages			1
a second phase will include restoring the iconic 2,000 - capacity cinema auditorium			0
the campaigners have their work cut out , especially as @entity115 is seeking planning permission for a supermarket next door to @entity23 , potentially spoiling the heritage feel of the site .			2

rides that once *thrilled* holidaymakers lie broken or partly dismantled
however there are signs of revival around the *corner* for @entity6 's seafront
