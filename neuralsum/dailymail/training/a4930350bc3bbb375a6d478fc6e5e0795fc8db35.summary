taking vitamin pills containing high doses could be bad for your health new research suggests taking vitamin pills in high doses could be bad for your health , say scientists			1
a study found that voles who were given a lot of vitamins c and @entity13 had a reduced lifespan of up to a quarter			1
researchers said the findings , published in @entity17 , raise questions about the benefits of popping the supplements			0
the human body does not make or store vitamin c and gets its supply from fruit and vegetables			0
it only needs 40mg a day to keep cells healthy and promote healing			0
@entity13 helps maintain the structure of cells and is found in foods such as nuts , seeds , and cereals			1
a man needs just 4mg a day and a woman should have 3mg			0
but tablets containing up to a hundred times this amount are available in health food shops			1
researchers fed field voles large quantities of @entity13 or c from the age of two months and compared their longevity to groups given a regular diet			1
they say that voles were used for the study as giving such high quantities of vitamins to humans would be unsafe			1
high doses of dietary antioxidants , such as vitamins , are commonly suggested to slow the process of cellular ageing by lessening the damage to proteins , lipids , and @entity62			2
previous research had shown the lives of mice could be extended by giving them supplements , but the opposite was found to be true in voles			2
they had much shorter lives on average if given extra @entity13 or @entity72 but despite these effects , the vitamin supplements had some effect in decreasing damage caused by aging			1
professor @entity78 , of @entity79 , said : ‘ when we began our research we expected voles ' lifespans would be boosted by the vitamin supplements in a similar way to the mice we had tested previously so we were surprised to see that was not the case			2
‘ our findings suggest major differences exist in the effects of high doses of antioxidants on oxidative damage and lifespan across species			2
’ @entity96 spend £ 175million a year on supplements and pills containing antioxidants claimed to help combat disease			0
scientists think it is safer for people to get the vitamins they need by eating a healthy and varied diet , rather than by taking supplements most popular are @entity105 and @entity13 and beta - carotene - the pigment found in carrots , tomatoes and broccoli which the body converts into @entity113 ten million @entity96 take these vitamins regularly but some scientists have dismissed them as useless while others have branded them dangerous			1
professor @entity78 said : ‘ there 's been a lot of research suggesting at best vitamin supplements produce no benefit and at worst can have deleterious effects			2
‘ @entity13 pills have been linked with prostate cancer and an increased risk of all - cause mortality for example			1
‘ most of the benefits have been shown in lab rodents so it 's interesting the supplements were reduced the lifespan of voles which usually live for about 500 or 600 days			0
‘ what we did not look at is what they actually died of so it would be important to discover that in the future			0
’ professor @entity142 , of @entity143 , said : ‘ it 's unlikely randomised controlled trials examining the effects of antioxidant supplementation on human lifespan would be possible so we are dependent on the results of animal studies			0
‘ it 's impossible at this stage to extrapolate the results from this small amount of data we have on voles and mice but it does suggest caution is warranted in the use of high doses of antioxidant vitamins			1
’ @entity163 , executive director of the @entity164 commented : ' the vitamin and mineral supplements industry has an exceptional record of both safety and efficacy , in the @entity170 and worldwide			0
' figures published by the @entity176 showed that there were only 11 reported reactions to food supplements over an 11 year period , the majority of them in the lowest category of harm			0

diets rich in @entity72 and @entity13 reduce life *expectancy* of voles by up to *25* *%*
tablets containing far more of the vitamins than people need are on sale
these could have *negative* health effects
