the @entity1 score moved to @entity2 4 on monday night in @entity3 and the good news for football is that with so much playing time potentially still ahead of them the greatest head - to - head in the game ’s history might still have years to play out			1
‘ do n’t bet against it being 5 - 4 to @entity2 in a couple of years , ’ was the sentiment of one @entity13 commentator in this morning ’s celebration of their man winning the @entity1 2014 and it ’s easy to see why even non-madrid supporters might agree that @entity2 now has everything in his favour to glide past @entity21 by winning @entity22 of the year two more times			1
but to doubt @entity21 ’s ability to bounce back in this two - man tug - o - war for world supremacy is to massively underestimate someone who is still only 27 – in any normal career he would now be entering his prime			1
@entity33 poses with his @entity1 trophy as he returned to training with @entity13 on tuesday real coach @entity36 ( centre ) poses with award winners @entity39 ( left ) , @entity40 ( second left ) , @entity2 ( second right ) and @entity41 ( right ) , who won the @entity42 for best goal @entity2 ( left ) and @entity21 have now won seven @entity1 titles between them @entity2 has won three world player of the year awards compared to @entity21 's four @entity2 beat his rival to the award as he was crowned the 2014 @entity1 winner after a stellar 12 months @entity54 may be in turmoil with elections called 12 - months early for the end of the year , a change of coach on the horizon , and a transfer ban to be suffered until 2016 but there were signs of life in their weekend win over @entity62			1
the enduring image from the game of @entity21 celebrating the third goal arm in arm with @entity67 and @entity68 is another clue as to why it might not be all downhill from here for the @entity72			1
he rose to prominence in that wonderful triangle of mesmerizing movement and short passes made up of @entity78 and @entity79			0
the @entity21 , @entity68 , @entity67 holy trinity is very different – one compromised of attackers not midfielders but it inspires awe all the same			1
he ca n’t complain that he is not in the right company as he attempts to get back on top in @entity87			0
@entity2 celebrated winning the @entity1 for the second consecutive year with a loud scream @entity91 magazine @entity89 says @entity2 's rallying cry means he is now looking to match @entity21 @entity2 , we know , will drive on and on until his supreme physique can no longer carry him			1
he will be 30 next month but seems to only be getting stronger			0
his agent @entity95 told @entity87 radio on monday night that his star client would play on until he was 40			2
‘ he will still score 20 goals a season with his head when he is 39 , mark my words ’ he said			0
the implication of that statement was that even when he ca n’t sprint as he does now he will not lose his aerial prowess			0
having started his career as a wiry winger and become a wide forward he could easily finish up an out - an - out centre - forward who can no longer create the chances quite so freely , but can still take them			0
@entity21 also looks capable of adjusting to suit the passing of time			2
he has a few more years in him yet as a forward but he has shown at the start of this season and during the last campaign that he also has it in him to become king of the assists and occupy a slightly deeper position in the team			0
@entity2 scored a staggering 56 goals in 51 appearances for @entity13 as they won four trophies in 2014 the 27 - year - old ( centre ) scored 50 goals in 52 appearances for @entity54 last season @entity1 : @entity33 women 's world player of the year : @entity129 @entity131 award : @entity41 world coach of the year for men 's football : @entity135 world coach of the year for women 's football : @entity138 @entity139 : @entity140 ; @entity141 , @entity39 , @entity142 , @entity143 ; @entity144 , @entity78 , @entity40 ; @entity21 , @entity2 , @entity145 @entity146 presidential award : @entity148 @entity146 fair play award : @entity146 volunteers for now both will keep doing what they have been doing for the last five years			1
each player has 252 goals in that time and @entity2 at least left no - one at @entity3 in any doubt that his hunger for more is not about to be lost with phrases such as ‘ my best goal is always the next one i ’m going to score ’ and ‘ i am not going to stop i want to reach @entity21			1
i do n’t lose sleep over it but it excites me			0
’ ‘ @entity168 ’ will not just mean winning another @entity1 but also another @entity161 and if he does it this season then he will have gone one better than his rival by becoming one of the first players to win back to back champions @entity166			2
both men will also be pushed on by competition from within their own clubs			0
in a @entity173 year @entity172 will have a chance to go for major individual honours this season and @entity2 could be travelling to @entity3 with the @entity177 next january			2
@entity172 already has a better free - kick scoring ratio – one every nine attempts over one every 15 – and it was the former @entity180 forward who stepped into @entity2 ’s shoes last season when injury kept him out of the @entity186 final to score the winning goal			2
there seemed to be a frosty atmosphere between @entity21 and @entity2 during monday 's press conference at @entity54 , @entity67 is emerging as @entity21 ’s long - term heir and like @entity172 he will expect to feature at least in the team of the year at the @entity146 gala in 2016			1
the principle motivation for both remains the same though – being better than @entity21 and @entity54 for @entity2 , and being better than @entity13 and @entity2 for @entity21			1
the two men were more comfortable in each other ’s company this year than in previous ceremonies			0
they remain worlds apart in terms of temperament and personality			2
if @entity21 does lift the @entity206 next year there will be no primal scream celebration and @entity2 probably wo n’t be wearing a burgundy tuxedo			1
but what does seem very likely is that both men will be back on the podium			0
they have years ahead of them – this duel has only just have begun .			0

@entity33 won the 2014 @entity1 title on monday evening
@entity13 star now has three titles to @entity21 's four
@entity2 , 29 , and @entity21 , 27 , are still in the prime of their careers
read : @entity2 and @entity21 remain best of *enemies*
