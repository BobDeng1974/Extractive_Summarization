by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 14:07 est , 18 march 2013 a couple who said they were left a £ 500,000 legacy by an 80 - year old ' spoilt princess ' because she was cross with her family have been stripped of the money by a high court judge			1
grieving widow @entity8 was said to have cut her relatives out of her will because she felt they were not taking enough notice of her in her final years			2
mrs @entity8 , the matriarch of a large family of ' @entity13 ' from @entity14 , east @entity15 , died in october 2010 , less than two months after drawing up a will for the first time			1
@entity18 and @entity19 have been stripped of their inheritance from @entity8 by a @entity23 judge the will left everything she owned to the ' dear friends ' @entity26 and his wife @entity28			1
mr @entity26 , an ex-firefighter honoured with an mbe for his role as general secretary of the @entity32 , and his wife , said the old lady had every reason to be generous to them			0
as close friends who had done a great deal for her in her final years , they insisted mrs @entity8 was disgruntled with her relatives ' because " @entity44 " was n't the centre of attention ' any more			1
but a judge ruled that the will is invalid because mrs @entity8 was not in her right mind when she signed it			1
the court earlier heard mrs @entity8 signed the will despite having an extensive network of living relatives			1
her bequest to the @entity54 included her most valuable asset - her £ 500,000 house in @entity56 , @entity57			0
@entity8 was not in her right mind when she signed the will in august 2010 , a judge ruled mr @entity26 had ' made himself extremely useful ' to mrs @entity8 in the three years after the death of her husband @entity61 in 2007			1
he drew up and witnessed her will himself as well as acting as her sole executor , the family 's barrister @entity62 told the court			0
mrs @entity8 's niece , @entity66 , 51 , argued that the ' difficult ' and increasingly frail 80 - year - old lacked the legal capacity to make a valid will and that she did not ' know and approve ' of its contents			1
mrs @entity66 , 51 , insisted the whole family had remained close until the end of mrs @entity8 's life			1
' i would n't be here today if i did n't know she was going to leave her estate to her family , ' she said in a previous court appearance			0
' @entity8 was almost like a second mother to myself and my brothers and sisters			0
' mr @entity62 said mrs @entity8 - whose family members said was ' treated as a princess and indulged and always put first ' - had gone into a ' catastrophic mental decline ' following the death of her husband in 2007 and her twin brother @entity87 in june 2010			1
he described her state of mind at the time of the will as ' severe , even psychotic , depression or pathological bereavement reaction			0
' sir @entity93 , for the @entity54 , who are in their 70s and live near @entity96 , urged the judge to uphold the will - the only one mrs @entity8 ever made - as valid			1
he claimed that ' @entity99 's temper ' and the ' tongue lashings that everyone received from @entity8 ' had caused a rift between her and the rest of the family			2
' by the time of @entity61 's death , she was no longer the centre of attention , ' he said			0
' the family support she depended on as " @entity44 " was n't available			0
' the reality is that this unusual woman was carrying on at her death as she had carried on in life , wanting to be the centre of attention			0
' mr @entity62 claimed : ' a lonely , housebound , childless widow was obviously open to suggestion			0
' ' mr @entity26 was not a man to miss an opportunity for making suggestions for his own advancement			0
' judge @entity122 , ruling on the case , said : ' the @entity124 ' case is that @entity8 decided to leave all her property to them because she was not on good terms with her family and that they neglected her during her final years			1
home : this house in @entity56 , @entity57 made up the vast majority of the value of the disputed will ' mr @entity26 also recalled that @entity8 had told him about various angry rows that she had with @entity87 over the years			0
' but she added : ' mr @entity26 would have to have very little understanding of human nature to interpret @entity8 ' complaints about @entity87 's behaviour as meaning that @entity8 would be unperturbed by her twin brother 's death			2
' the judge concluded that , when she signed the will , mrs @entity8 ' was suffering from an affective disorder brought about by her deep grief at the death of her brother , combined with her continuing fragile mental state arising from her advanced age , her physical frailty and her continuing grief for her husband			1
she said : ' i do not regard mr @entity26 as a dishonest person			0
i do not believe that he decided to befriend @entity8 with the cynical intention at the outset of eventually drawing up her will to his own benefit			0
' i have concluded that the help he and mrs @entity19 gave @entity8 , as well as his rather judgmental and disapproving attitude towards her family , have generated in mr @entity26 's mind an inappropriate sense of entitlement to @entity8 ' property			1
' she was a person whose mental state was fragile throughout her adult life , particularly in response to bereavement			0
' in my view , therefore , in august 2010 when the will was made , [ the evidence ] indicates that @entity8 was likely to be undergoing a severe grief reaction to @entity87 's death			2
mrs @entity8 's nieces @entity66 , left , and @entity175 , right , said the inheritance should be theirs judge @entity122 continued : ' i have seen photographs taken at @entity87 's funeral which show a rather disheveled and very thin elderly woman being supported by family members			1
' mr @entity26 challenged this evidence and said that , although @entity8 was physically frail , she was not vague or confused			0
on this point though i prefer the evidence of the @entity8 family			2
' the fact that i have found that @entity8 did not have mental capacity to make the will means that she did not know or approve of the contents of the will either			2
' there is no evidence from anyone other than mr @entity26 that @entity8 ever read the will or had the will read out to her			0
' taking into account all the evidence i have heard about how the will came to be made and the relationship between @entity8 and her family , on one hand , and the relationship between @entity8 and the @entity124 on the other hand , i am sure that @entity8 could not have known or approved the contents of her will			2
' the contested will is invalid on two grounds , ' the judge concluded , stripping the @entity124 of their inheritance and declaring that mrs @entity8 died intestate			1
the money will now pass to mrs @entity8 's next of kin .			2

@entity8 cut whole family out of her will two months before her death in 2010
she left everything she owned to her friends @entity18 and @entity19
relatives claimed will was invalid because she was unable to make *decisions*
but the @entity124 insisted she wanted to *punish* family for ignoring her
high court judge rules mrs @entity8 was not in her right mind at the time
