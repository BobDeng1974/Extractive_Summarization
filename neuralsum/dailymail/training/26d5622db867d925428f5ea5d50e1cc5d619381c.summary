solar storms are listed as one of most serious threats on the @entity3 , alongside flu and volcanic eruptions			1
to monitor the threat , the @entity6 has today opened a public forecasting service that will measure the solar climate , track flares and monitor the @entity12 's magnetic field			1
the centre in @entity14 will allow anyone to find out about weather in @entity12 's orbit and look out for potential disruptions , which could affect power grids and radio transmissions			1
to monitor the threat , the @entity6 has today opened a public forecasting service that will measure the solar climate , track flares and monitor the @entity12 's magnetic field the centre has been monitoring space weather for a number of weeks , working with experts across at the @entity6 in the @entity34 and in the @entity35 - which already has a prediction service			1
the forecasts will be put together by analysing images and solar activity data by satellites and ground - based instrument			2
they will be available to view on the @entity6 website			1
solar storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun and are accompanied by coronal mass ejections , or @entity49			1
cmes are the most energetic events in our solar system - involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun ’s surface into space			1

cmes are the most energetic events in our solar system - involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun ’s surface into space ( illustrated ) they are often preceded by a solar flare - a massive release of energy from the sun in the form of gamma rays , x-rays , protons and electrons			2
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of manned missions			0
but they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity12 ’s magnetic field			1
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			2
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
a solar superstorm occurs when a @entity101 of sufficient magnitude tears into the @entity12 ’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart			1
such an event would induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines , causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components			0
@entity112 , who was a member of an international task force - dubbed @entity114 - set up to identify the risks of a solar storm and how its impact could be minimised , warned of the danger man faces from ' solar super-storms			0
' and the need to monitor such risks has become even greater , warn experts , as society is ever more dependent on technology			0
mr @entity112 , carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at @entity127 , said it is only a ' matter of time ' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards @entity12			1
' without power , people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations , get money from cash dispensers or pay online , ' he said			0
' @entity139 and sewage systems would be affected too , meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip , with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning			0
' this image of a huge solar flare ( top left ) was captured by the @entity149 ( @entity149 )			0
one of the most dramatic features is the way the entire surface of the sun seems to ripple with the force of the eruption the largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the @entity158 , named after the @entity160 astronomer @entity159 who spotted the preceding solar flare			0
this massive @entity101 released about 1022 kj of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion @entity165 bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the @entity12 at speeds of up to 3000 km / s. however , its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles ( 200,000 km ) of telegraph lines			2
@entity175 scientists have predicted that the @entity12 is in the path of a @entity159 - level event every 150 years on average			2
this means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent .			0

@entity6 has opened a @entity184 in @entity14
forecasters will monitor solar flares and magnetic storms in @entity12 's orbit
disruptions can ruin satellite signals and wipe out power grids
they are one of most serious threats listed on @entity3
