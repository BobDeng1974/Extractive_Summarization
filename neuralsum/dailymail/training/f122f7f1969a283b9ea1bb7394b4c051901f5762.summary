by @entity0 published : 04:52 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 17 january 2013 online retailer @entity1 is set to buck the trend of retailers leaving the @entity5 by expanding its network of physical stores			0
the firm , which owns brands such as @entity11 , simply be and @entity12 , yesterday revealed that its revenues rose by 8.5 per cent last year despite the sluggish economy			1
the plan to move into the @entity5 comes despite a wave of high - profile bankruptcies in the past week , with @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 shutting down or entering administration			2
expansion : @entity1 , owner of @entity23 , is set to open more @entity5 stores selling its brands @entity1 , which specialises in clothes for older women and people who are too large to wear traditional fashion lines , has in the past been primarily a mail - order retailer			1
however , online sales now account for 54 per cent of its revenue after rising by 17 per cent over the past 19 weeks , according to @entity35			2
as the company seeks to cut costs on its catalogue division , one likely strategy is to open more @entity5 branches selling its brands			1
' we are an online company looking to open stores , ' chief executive @entity41 said			0
brands : the retailer specialises in aiming its products at middle - aged women and larger customers for men : @entity12 , promoted by cricketer @entity50 , is another successful @entity1 brand the retailer currently operates a total of 48 stores , including seven which opened in the past year selling products from simply be , the ' plus size ' women 's brand			1
mr @entity41 said @entity1 would open up to six more simply be stores in 2013 , and would aim to end up with a network of 25 stores with ' nationwide coverage '			2
some of the branches will also sell the @entity12 range for larger men , which is promoted by former @entity65 cricketer @entity50			0
shares in the firm have risen by 60 per cent over the course of the past year as it saw strong growth in the @entity71 as well as in its @entity73 stores and online			1
struggling : @entity19 is one of many well - known firms to have gone into administration in recent months the success of @entity1 , which has been operating from @entity78 since 1859 , stands in stark contrast to the fate of other major brands			1
this week it was announced that both music retailer @entity19 and video rental chain @entity20 have gone into administration after seeing their profits relentlessly squeezed by the rise of digital media and online retailers			0
the iconic firms could disappear from the @entity5 within months if administrators do not succeed in finding a buyer for them			0
other companies hit by the double - dip recession have been forced to close down altogether in the wake of squeezed consumer spending			0
@entity96 , @entity97 and @entity18 all shut up shop recently as the @entity5 vacancy rate reached an astonishing one in nine			0
among the others to go into administration are @entity102 , @entity103 , blacks , @entity105 , and @entity106 , while more are expected as the economy shows little sign of picking up any time soon			0
@entity1 may be expanding its physical presence , but the past few years have seen brutal conditions on the @entity5 as a host of well - known retailers have gone out of business december 2008 : @entity115 , the furniture retailer , was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn , as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemployment january 2009 : @entity123 , right , shuttered its 800 stores , bringing home to many the scale of the @entity73 's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time february 2009 : @entity131 , formerly @entity132 , stopped trading around @entity133 - and refused to honour its gift cards , leading to widespread customer anger december 2009 : borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of cds and dvds were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers october 2012 : @entity96 closed all but 20 of its stores , which were taken over and re-branded by @entity146 - leading to the death of the @entity96 brand and 550 employees losing their jobs december 2012 : @entity97 shut down just before @entity133 , leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a Â£ 50million tab related to its bankruptcy , which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers january 2013 : jessops was closed by administrator @entity161 earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photography ; this week both @entity19 and @entity166 went into administration , raising the prospect of further store closures			1
