by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 07:49 est , 10 may 2013 an historic @entity2 vase made for an 18th century emperor has sold at auction for £ 50,000 - but could have been worth ten times that value had a previous owner not drilled a hole in the bottom to turn it into a lamp			1
the centuries - old vase was made for the @entity11 , but its hugely important seal of authentication was destroyed when a two centimetre hole was drilled in its bottom to feed an electrical cable through			1
the former owner of the antique even customised it with fittings and a garish lampshade , giving it pride of place in his hallway			1
cut price : @entity28 @entity27 , left , carefully holds the £ 50,000 vase , right , that could have sold for up to £ 500,000 but experts believe that if he had n't have drilled the hole , then the 15 inch tall vase may have sold for up to £ 500,000			1
the vase sold instead for £ 47,800 when it was sold at @entity37 's auctioneers of @entity38 , @entity39			1
the bottle vase dates from the 18th century is likely to have been made for the @entity42 household			1
a relative of the unnamed owner bought it off a @entity47 - based dealers at the turn of the 20th century and converted it into a lamp years later			1
it was inherited by the last owner who has kept it ever since at his home on the @entity54			2
@entity55 , a specialist in @entity57 art at @entity37 's , said he was invited to the property to inspect other antiques when he saw the vase out of the corner of his eye			0
he said : ' it was on a floor - standing cabinet in the hallway			0
i initially thought that it could n't be original and asked the owner if i could have a closer look			0
expensive : the valuable vase was commissioned for the @entity71 who ruled @entity2 in the 18th century ' as soon as i touched it i knew it was a fabulous piece of @entity2 porcelain			1
' i was hoping to find an @entity42 mark on the bottom of it but tragically there was a hole from where the mark would have been			0
' my heart did sink and the joy of finding the vase was equalled to my disappointment			0
' given the sheer quality of the workmanship on the vase , which was top notch , it is highly likely there would have been an @entity42 reign mark on it			0
' these marks tell you during which reign it was made and also that it was made for the @entity42 household			0
' the owner told me it was n't him who made the drill hole			0
he was a little disappointed but just said that was the way it was			0
' i brought it back to @entity38 and very carefully removed the lamp fittings around the top of it			1
' the bottle vase was decorated with buddhistic lions in underglaze blue and red , a technically difficult process			0
@entity113 , a partner at @entity37 's , added : ' the irony is that if the vase had not been drilled and turned into a lamp base , it could easily have fetched £ 100,000			1
' if the @entity42 reign mark was still intact , the vase would have sold for more than £ 500,000			2
' ceramics from the @entity121 period are highly - sought after , especially among the newly rich @entity2 who are buying back their lost heritage			2
ruined : the two centimetre hole was drilled to allow an electrical cable to feed up into the vase and turn it into a table lamp in 2010 , a pair of @entity11 vases which were given to a couple as a wedding gift and kept on a bedroom shelf as ornaments fetched £ 500,000 at the same auction house			1
later the same year a blue and white dragon vase from the same era , valued at just £ 10,000 , sold for almost £ 5million at an auction in @entity139			2
earlier this year , another vase which was valued at £ 10,000 to £ 15,000 sold for almost £ 1million in @entity141			2
emperor @entity11 @entity11 was the sixth emperor of the @entity144 - led @entity143 and the fourth @entity11 to rule @entity2 proper			1
he reigned from october 1735 until february 1796 making him one of the country 's longest serving emperors			0
@entity11 , whose name means ' lasting eminence ' , was also considered one of the most enlightened of the emperors			2
he was an enthusiastic patron of all forms of @entity2 art and published catalogues of @entity156 collections which he expanded greatly			2
the @entity71 wrote thousands of poems in beautiful calligraphy , was a talented painter and commissioned many magnificent temples and palaces			0
during his reign , @entity11 was determined to expand his empire and @entity164 became a protectorate , @entity166 and @entity167 were conquered and @entity168 and the @entity169 acknowledged @entity2 suzerainty			1
in the last decade of his reign , delegating decisions to others led to an increase in corruption and inefficiency in government			0
he officially abdicated in favour of his son in 1796 so as not to rule longer than his grandfather , but ultimately reigned until his death two years later			0

the lamp was commissioned for 18th century @entity2 emperor @entity11
a previous owner bought it from a dealer at the turn of the 20th century
but he customised it with a garish lampshade and fittings
it sold at an auctioneers in @entity38 , @entity39 , for £ 47,800
