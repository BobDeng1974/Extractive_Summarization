new questions surround the disappearance of an @entity3 soldier who was captured by the @entity4 after an email that he sent to his parents hints that he was so disappointed with the @entity3 mission in @entity8 that he may have defected			1
shortly before he disappeared three years ago , @entity9 told his parents he was ' ashamed to even be @entity3 ' and was disgusted with the @entity11 , according to emails quoted in @entity14 magazine			1
@entity9 , a 26 - year - old @entity11 sergeant from @entity15 , @entity16 , was taken prisoner on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity8			1
captured : @entity9 , 26 , was an @entity11 sergeant when he was taken prisoner on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity8 the military has never detailed circumstances of his disappearance or capture , and he is not classified as a deserter			1
he was initially listed as ' duty status unknown ' and is now considered ' missing - captured			0
' he is the only @entity3 prisoner of war from the @entity8 conflict , and @entity3 officials say they are actively trying to free him			1
the @entity27 declined comment on the emails or @entity9 's possible motivation for leaving his base in eastern @entity8 in 2009			1
the @entity14 article , to be published friday , also quotes other soldiers and associates of @entity9 's as saying that he had talked about walking to @entity35 if his deployment was ' lame ' and that shortly before his disappearance he had asked whether he should take his weapon if he left the base			2
friends and other soldiers describe a survivalist mentality , and @entity9 's father , @entity43 , told the magazine that his son was ' living in a novel			0
' ' the future is too good to waste on lies , ' one email reads			0
' and life is way too short to care for the damnation of others , as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong			0
in custody : the @entity4 released a video of @entity9 after they captured him and a man holds up the soldier 's dogtags to prove that it is in fact the 26 - year - old classification : he was initially listed as ' duty status unknown ' and is now considered ' missing - captured ' ‘ the @entity3 army is the biggest joke the world has to laugh at			1
it is the army of liars , backstabbers , fools , and bullies			0
‘ the few good ( sergeants ) are getting out as soon as they can , and they are telling us privates to do the same			0
’ the emails were provided to the magazine by @entity9 's family in @entity16 , which has gone public with its own discontent with @entity3 efforts to free their son			1
there is no way to authenticate the emails			0
some of @entity9 's reported words read like a suicide note			0
' i am sorry for everything , ' he wrote			0
' the horror that is @entity3 is disgusting			0
' questionable clues : reports emerged in 2010 that a @entity4 leader told @entity97 officials that @entity9 was teaching @entity4 members how to build and detonate bombs , but the @entity3 denied it he mailed home boxes containing his uniform and books			1
in 2010 , rumors circulated following allegations made by @entity4 leader @entity106 , who said that @entity9 has been training and helping the @entity109 operatives how to make bombs			1
@entity112 officials immediately denied the charges , saying that the stories told by @entity106 did n’t ‘ hold much water from the get - go ’ since he claimed that @entity9 had weapons and arms on him when he was captured , which is not true			2
both official reports and the @entity14 article say that @entity9 left the base with only a bottle of water and a compass			2
the claims add an element of @entity127 storytelling to the situation , and not surprisingly so : the idea of an @entity3 soldier defecting to the @entity4 before returning to the @entity3 is the basis of @entity132 ’s hit @entity133			2
similar : the story of @entity9 echoes that of the tv show homeland , starring @entity136 as the soldier with a suspicious past and @entity139 is the agent who is daring enough to question the returning war hero @entity136 plays the soldier with a suspicious past while @entity139 is the agent who is daring enough to question the returning war hero			0
in spite of @entity112 denials , the emails that @entity9 sent to his parents reveal that he was in a seemingly emotional state at the time of his disappearance , which may lend credence to the theories that he may have ulterior motives behind his imprisonment			2
@entity3 government officials continue to brush off claims of defection , and have continued plans to retrieve the soldier			0
@entity9 is the subject of a proposed prisoner swap in which he would be traded for five @entity4 adherents imprisoned by the @entity3 at the military prison at @entity164 , @entity165			1
the @entity4 have walked away from the deal and larger negotiations with the @entity3 , but the @entity169 administration is still pushing a negotiated settlement between the @entity4 and the @entity3 - backed government in @entity8			1
continued efforts : @entity3 officials are trying to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the @entity4			2

@entity9 , 26 , walked out of @entity3 base in @entity8 in june 2009 and was captured by the @entity4
the day before leaving camp , he emailed his parents about how he had become *extremely* *disillusioned* with the @entity11 and @entity3 *policy*
