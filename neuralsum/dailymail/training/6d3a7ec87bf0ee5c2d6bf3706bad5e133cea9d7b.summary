however muscle relaxants were found in @entity15 's blood , with a medical examiner ruling he died of a drug overdose			1
on the night the boy died @entity13 was in a custody dispute with his ex-wife			2
prosecutors argued it was a case of murder and attempted suicide			0
in a 28 - page ruling , @entity18 said deputy @entity71 attorney @entity70 charged @entity13 with felony murder , on the grounds that @entity15 had died from child abuse inflicted by @entity13			1
however , when it came to the court case , @entity70 tried @entity13 as if he were charged with premeditated , intentional murder			2
@entity70 had been warned by @entity18 several times over the course of the trial not to treat the charge as premeditated			0

after several years of changing defense attorneys , @entity13 finally went to trial seven years after @entity15 's death , in july 2011			1
he was found guilty in november 2011 , with the jury deciding there were aggravating factors that made him eligible for the death penalty			0
but before the jury could sentence @entity13 , a juror came forward accusing the forewoman of browbeating other jurors into a guilty verdict			1
the verdict was thrown out in march 2012			0
in fall that year , @entity70 told the judge that the original indictment and the intent to seek the death penalty had been dropped and asked that another judge and defense team be appointed			2
in late 2012 , the @entity82 ruled that @entity70 could indeed re-indict @entity13 , unless @entity18 found that @entity70 had done so in bad faith			0
on tuesday , @entity18 made that finding , in addition to the finding of prosecutorial misconduct			0
the @entity134 however still has options to appeal			0
' we will review the judge ’s allegations as well as refer the record of the proceedings to our @entity143 and @entity144 section for review , ' county attorney @entity136 told the @entity146			0
' we will also review the conduct of defense counsel and that of the judge for appropriate action			0
