' as his family has continued to deal with his bank and their debt management company , it has become clear that those institutions do not themselves know whether any debts are owed			2
' we do not know how much this confusion and the demands affected @entity2 ’s decision , but the stress that people are put under by financial institutions that do not understand their own demands must be immense			0
” the family added that they were unhappy at the ' lack of communication and contradictory information ' from police during the investigation			0
