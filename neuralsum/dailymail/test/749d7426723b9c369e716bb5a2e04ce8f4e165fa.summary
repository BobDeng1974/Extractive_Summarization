mr @entity214 ’s father , @entity233 , was a respected physician and fellow of the @entity235 who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of @entity5 in @entity239 in the 1970s			2

if we do not take an inclusive approach and provide treatment for people who need it , we will never prevent onward transmission			0
