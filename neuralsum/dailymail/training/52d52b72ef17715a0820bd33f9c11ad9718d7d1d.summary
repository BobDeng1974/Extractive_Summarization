file picture record numbers of anorexia sufferers – some aged just nine – are being admitted to hospital , according to shocking figures			1
every night , 350 hospital beds across @entity11 on average are taken up by a patient desperately ill with anorexia , bulimia or another eating disorder			1
the figures have doubled in a decade			2
last year , 15 children aged only between five and nine were admitted to hospital with eating disorders , underlining fears that unhealthy obsessions with food are developing very early			1
there is also growing concern that the @entity25 is worsening the crisis by refusing to treat patients because they are not deemed thin enough			1
many clinics turn patients away until they fall below a certain body weight			1
one young woman told this when she appealed for help condemned it as a ‘ perverse incentive ’ to lose weight			2
the figures come after the @entity25 was heavily criticised in a report by the @entity39			1
it revealed how a gifted 19 - year - old died following failings by @entity43 , hospital doctors and psychologists			2
@entity46 was meant to have weekly check - ups but was allowed to become so thin that she slurred her words and was later found collapsed in her student flat			2
patients with anorexia , bulimia or other eating disorders accounted for 122,150 bed nights in 2012/13			1
this is up from 100,550 in 2011/12 , said the @entity56			0
in contrast , 51,878 bed days were taken up by such patients in 2002/3			2
a total of 2,381 patients were admitted to hospital last year , three - quarters with anorexia			1
the figure is up from 2,287 in the previous 12 months			0
girls aged 15 are by far the most likely to be taken to hospital , with 200 admitted last year			2
charities said these figures are the ‘ tip ’ of the iceberg as they do not include thousands of sufferers battling eating disorders at home			1
@entity74 , who died from anorexia aged just 18			0
she weighed just 5st when she died when she collapsed and died , former private schoolgirl @entity74 weighed barely 5st			0
the 18 - year - old had fought anorexia for five years and was admitted to hospital when she was so thin that she could barely walk			1
but she was discharged 11 days later when doctors deemed her ‘ physically fit ’			0
they did not discuss their decision with her parents as she was over 18			0
miss @entity74 , who went to @entity82 , @entity83 , was taken by her mother to @entity85 in october 2011			0
after being discharged , she continued to starve herself at home and refused to see a gp			0
the teenager , who hoped to be a nurse , suffered cardiac arrest a month later and died of brain damage a week later			0
at her inquest in february this year , her mother @entity92 said : ‘ she became frailer and frailer			0
she was not strong enough to walk			0
to get around inside the house , she had to crawl			0
‘ it is impossible to describe the impact of @entity74 ’s death on my family or explain our experience of @entity74 ’s dreadful journey as a teenager with anorexia to her demise at 18			0
she was a wonderful daughter and a very talented and supremely caring human being			0
’ they also do not take into account patients at private clinics who have given up on the @entity25 due to the lengthy waiting times			1
@entity112 , of the eating disorder charity beat , said : ‘ people often tell us that they were told their @entity117 ( body mass index ) was not low enough			2
‘ with most other illnesses , no - one would tell a patient to go away and come back when their problem was a lot worse			0
‘ yet people with eating disorders are often made to become even more dangerously ill before getting the help they so desperately need			1
eating disorders are serious mental illnesses			1
’ this year , a survey of 500 patients by the charity found a quarter had waited at least six months for treatment while nearly one in ten had been waiting for more than a year			1
a total of 2,381 patients were admitted to hospital last year , three - quarters with anorexia			1
the figure is up from 2,287 in the previous 12 months			0
file picture @entity140 , 24 , of @entity141 , who has had anorexia since she was only 11 , said : ‘ i ’m trying to get @entity25 treatment but i ’m not deemed sick enough			1
it is like a perverse incentive scheme to get worse			0
’ around 3 per cent of adults are thought to have an eating disorder but some estimates suggest it could be 6.5 per cent			2
women make up 90 per cent of cases			2
a fifth of anorexia sufferers die from complications caused by starving themselves , including organ damage or heart failure			0
the proliferation of pro-anorexia websites has been blamed for the rise of eating disorders in the young , especially in girls			1
there are around 400 to 500 such sites where users swap tips on how to starve themselves and boast about how few calories they have consumed .			0

350 hospital beds are taken up with *victims* of eating disorders each night
