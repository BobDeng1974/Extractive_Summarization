@entity4 among first - time drivers and mothers on the school run , @entity0 has long been a favourite among motorists			2
and while the @entity8 brand may have a holding with the average driver , few would consider it a thrill - seeker 's choice , much less the manufacturer of @entity15 's fastest car			2
but that is exactly how daredevil @entity17 has described his speedy run - around , after modifying a 1967 vox @entity0 estate to make what he claims to be the fastest car in the country			1
with a 788 horsepower engine , it can reach 60mph in three seconds and has thrown dust on the bonnets of some of the world 's flashiest vehicles			1

' my @entity53 superbike is about 220bhp and probably a bit quicker to 100mph , but if you put them on the road together the @entity0 would leave it for dust between 100mph and 200mph			2
' ' the truth is , this is the quickest machine i have ever driven or ridden			0
