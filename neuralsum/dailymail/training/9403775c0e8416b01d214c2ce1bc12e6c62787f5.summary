’ the judges added : ‘ there was no evidence that the wearing of other , previously authorised , items of religious clothing , such as turbans and hijabs , by other employees , had any negative impact on @entity3 ’ brand or image			1
moreover , the fact that the company was able to amend the uniform code to allow for the visible wearing of religious symbolic jewellery demonstrates that the earlier prohibition was not of crucial importance			0
’ dr @entity160 said tribunals and courts should not have to rule on what symbols people could or could not wear @entity35 should be able to wear the symbols of their religion without being discriminated against , the archbishop of @entity204 said today.reacting to the judgment from the @entity37 , dr @entity160 also said tribunals and courts should not have to rule on what symbols people could or could not wear.but the @entity211 ( @entity212 ) said ' true religious freedom ' was for employees who feel parts of their job go against their conscience to find another @entity218 said : ' @entity35 are not obliged to wear a cross but should be free to show their love for and trust in @entity26 in this way if they so wish			1
