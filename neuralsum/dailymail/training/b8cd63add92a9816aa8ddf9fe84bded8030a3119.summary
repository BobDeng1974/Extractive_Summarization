by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:10 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 9 march 2013 the @entity2 will block further cuts to welfare unless @entity5 drops his opposition to to stripping rich pensioners of their benefits			2
@entity10 warned @entity5 that any additional raid on @entity13 's vast benefits bill must ' start ' with reducing handouts like the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes for well - off over- 65s			2
the intervention comes after business secretary @entity18 said health and foreign aid should not be protected from spending cuts			1
@entity10 addressed delegates during a q&a session at the party 's annual conference in @entity26 many faces : mr @entity10 was very animated during a q&a session with delegates in @entity26 mr @entity10 defended benefits cuts during a heated @entity32 session with activists at the @entity2 spring conference in @entity26			2
he challenged defence secretary @entity35 to find savings from his own budget instead of demanding general cuts to welfare			1
mr @entity10 said : ' @entity35 is making his case for his own department and is slightly scouring the @entity43 landscape to find what he considers to be the easy alternative to a lot of what are undoubtedly difficult decisions which need to be taken in relation to the @entity50			2
' the @entity2 leader insisted he was not opposed to further cuts			2
' if you want to revisit welfare then let ’s at least start with the people at the top			2
@entity18 receives a bus pass in @entity59 ; he does n’t feel he needs it			1
' why are we giving – @entity18 is n’t a millionaire – but why are we giving these universal no - questions - asked benefits to millionaire pensioners when people on much lower incomes are having their support from the benefits system cut or curtailed			1
' and the @entity69 do n’t want to do that			2
so they do n’t even in their great enthusiasm for welfare reform , let ’s go after welfare ; go after welfare , even when they want to do that they wo n’t start at the top and work down			2
' mr @entity10 earlier met young activists and new @entity2 mp @entity81 mr @entity10 went on : ' there is real difference there and i have made clear to the prime minister and the chancellor : the @entity2 are not averse to welfare reform , we have done a lot , and we have just to £ 3.5billion in welfare savings in the last autumn statement ' but if you want to do more you have got to do it fairly , you have got to show that you are prepared to start at the top and work down			2
' earlier mr @entity18 claimed further cuts to his business department would damage science and universities , as he repeated his call for extra spending on big infrastructure projects to kickstart the economy			1
and he launched an outstpoken attack on @entity105 demanding deeper spending cuts as waging ' ideological jihad ' against public services			1
business secretary @entity18 has questioned whether health , schools and defence spending should be protected from cuts the @entity113 is embroiled in a growing public row about the need for further spending cuts in 2015 - 16 , beyond the next general election			1
chancellor @entity118 has privately made clear he is relaxed about minister ‘ fighting it out among themselves ’ over where the axe should fall			2
defence secretary @entity35 and home secretary @entity124 are among the @entity69 ministers resisting more cuts to their budgets			1
but mr @entity18 is seen as the ‘ shop steward ’ of the so - called @entity129 of ministers preparing to defy the @entity131			1
in his fringe appearance last night , mr @entity18 he said there would be ' pressure on public spending ' for years to come			1
and in an strongly - worded attack on the @entity105 , he added : ' what we have to make absolutely clear is that there is a difference between managing public spending , controlling public spending in that context - having that financial discipline - and the kind of thing that a lot of right - wing conservatives are wishing for , which is a kind of @entity13 @entity148 , ' he said			1
' a kind of ideological jihad against public spending and public services			1
' mr @entity10 applauds during a rally to mark @entity154 , which was dominated by party angst over its handling of the allegations against @entity159 in an interview ahead of the @entity2 spring conference in @entity26 , mr @entity18 warned serious damage will be done to @entity13 industry if the coalition continues to spare some departments from any cuts			1
@entity5 promised real terms increase in health funding and the defence equipment and schools budgets will be protected post- 2015			0
the coalition has also committed to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of gdp			0
mr @entity18 insisted he is not ‘ sticking his head in the sand ’ but is angry that so many areas have been protected			1
former @entity2 leader @entity178 said he did not want the party being in government to be a ' blip ' in its history			0
in a rousing speech as the head of the party 's election campaign said he wanted being in power to become a ' habit '			0
and he told activists : ' you know , i 'm sure that you , like me , have often told children and grandchildren that it 's not the winning that matters , it 's the taking part			0
' well let me let you into a little secret			0
that 's b * * * * * *			0
' he added : ' liberals have waited a hundred years for may 2010			0
' and i dreamt every hour of my leadership of our party , that one day we would have the opportunity to be where we are now , in government ; making a difference			0
' he told the @entity211 : ‘ in opposition i did not think that was a sensible way to approach public spending			1
i have gone along with it in government in coalition , as part of the team and all that , and we did that in the first wave of public spending cuts			1
’ mr @entity18 warned he will block further cuts to his @entity223			1
‘ we have delivered in the first spending round big spending cuts – not too many people give us credit for it but the administrative cuts have been 50 per cent			1
‘ we have lost a lot of civil servants – it is a much more efficient department			0
we have done ' brave things ' in quotes like student fees , privatising the @entity236 – radical things – but we have now got to the point where further significant cuts would do enormous damage to things that really do matter , like science and skills and innovation and universities			0
‘ obviously , that is not very sensible given that the overall objective of the government is to achieve extra growth			0
' i am always up for efficiency and quite brave reforms , so i am not just sticking my head in the sand , but you get to a point where the kind of cuts that are being considered will do serious damage to things that are essential for growth and the industrial strategy			0
i think we know there are large , alarming sums being sought			0
’ his criticism of the decision to international development from cuts comes as it emerged foreign aid is to be diverted through @entity13 companies to prevent it falling into the hands of corrupt and wasteful regimes			1
firms will use the money to win infrastructure contracts and boost struggling economies in @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279			0
the radical move , to be announced by international development secretary @entity281 next week , is being seen as a victory for common sense in the bitter controversy over the £ 11billion international development budget , which has been ringfenced while other departments face cuts			1
the @entity2 gather in @entity26 for their spring conference hoping to celebrate their victory in last week 's @entity291			0
@entity2 leader @entity10 hopes to use the spring conference to draw a line under a run of scandals but the party has been dogged by questions about its handling of groping allegations against former chief executive @entity159 and @entity301 's conviction for perverting the course of justice			2
senior party figures including @entity10 and his wife @entity305 have been forced to deny being told by mr @entity301 's estranged wife @entity306 that he forced her to take speeding points for him			0
the @entity2 hope to use the gathering to distance themselves from the @entity105 , and mr @entity18 has questioned mr @entity118 's focus on spending cuts to balance the nation 's books , arguing more could be raised from taxes			1
' the proposals for the one - year spending review , as we understand it , is for 85 per cent spending cuts versus 15 % tax rises			1
certainly as a @entity2 i would question that			0
' and he defied @entity5 's insistence that pensioner benefits like the winter fuel allowance should be protected from cuts			0
the 69 - yearold said : ' i have been getting the winter fuel payment for five years , it has been keeping me warm in @entity59			0
i actually give it away			0
' if we are in the realm of tough choices , why did we feel that this area is a sacred cow ? '			0
