a metal bolt the size of a human arm has broken off from a @entity4 skyscraper dubbed the ' @entity5 ' - for the third time in the past two months			2
@entity7 , the company which built the @entity8 , revealed yesterday that one of 3,000 ' mega-bolts ' holding the 48 - storey structure together had snapped			1
two steel bolts of the same type - measuring five inches in diameter - fell off @entity14 's fourth tallest building in november last year			1
hazardous : a third ' mega bolt ' has snapped from a @entity4 skyscraper dubbed the ' @entity5 ' ( pictured ) @entity18 averted : the building 's developer confirmed the structural integrity of the building had not been compromised the pavement around the building was cordoned off two months ago after one of the bolts fell to the ground , but no passers - by were harmed			1
in the latest incident , the third bolt snapped off but was caught instantly by a safety device installed on the building last year			1
tests conducted by the 224m - high building 's developer concluded the bolts have fractured because of a phenomenon known as ' hydrogen embrittlement '			1
this process occurs when hydrogen inadvertently seeps into the steel during the manufacturing phase , and slowly weakens it			0
the accident is the latest controversy attached to the ongoing spread of skyscrapers across @entity4 , which has prompted some critics to claim that the rapid pace of development could pose safety problems			2
the @entity5 was forced to adopt its unusual shape in a bid to preserve views of @entity54 in the skyline , while another skyscraper , dubbed the ' @entity57 ' , had to undergo renovation work after its windows focussed red - hot rays onto the pavement below			0
landmark : the ' @entity5 ' is located in the @entity63 and cost an estimated £ 286million to construct @entity7 insisted last night that the problem had been resolved and that other bolts in the building were not at risk of breaking			1
' in november 2014 , we reported that two bolts had fractured at the building , ' the firm said in a statement			2
' investigations undertaken by contractor @entity75 and structural engineers @entity77 have now been completed			0
these confirm that the problem is limited to certain bolts			2
' @entity77 has also confirmed that there is no adverse effect on the structural integrity of the building			1
a programme to replace a number of bolts will take place as a precautionary measure			0
' the ' @entity5 ' is located in the @entity63 and cost an estimated £ 286million to construct			0
it is the fourth tallest building in @entity14 , and the second tallest in the @entity92			0
despite the repeated accidents , the @entity92 - the area 's local authority - says it does not plan to intervene , and will leave the developer to determine whether or not the skyscraper poses a risk to the public			2
this latest incident comes at a bad time for @entity7 , who have recently announced they will be leasing an extra 93,000 square feet of the building 's space			1
controversy : a clutch of new skyscrapers have been built in @entity4 in the past few years plans for the @entity8 building were first proposed in 2001			1
the steel structure was completed in 2014 , and has earned the name the ' @entity5 ' for its distinctive wedge shape - designed to preserve the view of @entity54			0
owner / developer : @entity7 address : 122 leadenhall street , @entity63 nickname : the @entity5 construction period : 2001 - 2014 estimated cost : £ 286million floors : 48 height to tip : 224m @entity122 height : 203m @entity14 ranking : 4th tallest building in @entity14 global ranking : 493rd tallest building in world the two bolts which broke off last year were tested on site and in a laboratory at the time , with tests concluding that the fault was in the bolt 's material mechanism and not the structure itself			1
@entity7 is replacing ' mega-bolts ' on 11 floors of the building as a ' precautionary measure ' following last year 's probe			2
it is believed the first bolt broke on the 19th floor but stayed within the building 's structure , without hitting the ground - while the second bolt piece plummeted from the fifth floor			1
fortunately , it landed in an area already cordoned off for construction			0
floor space in the skyscraper , which was finally completed last month , is the most expensive in the @entity92 - @entity154 , the @entity155 insurance company , agreed to pay £ 85 per sq ft to rent the 41st floor			0
@entity158 , the multinational insurer , signed a contract to be the main tenant of the tower in 2011			0
the @entity5 was designed by @entity162 , who redeveloped @entity163 , but construction had to be halted during the recession when the value of commercial properties fell			0
the building 's sloping shape was calculated to allow a view of @entity54 's from certain vantage points around @entity4 .			0

the company who built @entity8 confirm a ' mega bolt ' snapped
@entity177 was attached to a safety device which stopped it falling to the ground
it is the third of 3,000 **similar** - sized bolts to break off the 48 - storey structure
area around building was cordoned off after **similar** incident in november
its developer @entity7 says structural integrity has not been weakened
