by @entity0 police have been forced to step in and move foolhardy weather - watchers away from the shore amidst fears that people were endangering themselves by getting too close to giant waves during a day of stormy weather			1
a family in @entity9 narrowly escaped being swept into the sea when a 20ft wave washed over them as they were walking along a sea wall			1
and a group of young men in @entity18 , @entity15 risked their lives by playing around on the narrow ledge of a wall as waves crashed around them			1
danger : a young family walking along a sea wall in @entity27 , @entity9 during stormy weather yesterday wave : the family were suddenly engulfed by a huge surge which crashed over the top of the wall do you know the family who were nearly swept away ? contact hugo.gye@dailymail.co.uk with any information			1
the @entity35 criticised people who lined the shore to watch the waves battering @entity40 's coasts			1
' clearly it is dangerous to get too close to these waves , ' a spokesman said			0
' there is colossal power in these waves that can knock people off their feet			0
' we would advice people to keep well away			0
there have already been two fatalities this year already and we urge you not to add to those statistics			2
' at @entity27 in @entity9 , which is almost the southernmost point in all of @entity40 , a father , mother and three young children were photographed walking along a barrier when a 20ft wave came over the top of the wall , drenching all four members of the family			1
the incident could have been extremely dangerous for the parents and children , who were in the middle of a narrow walkway and were nearly swept into the sea			1
aftermath : the family looked completely drenched after the wave came crashing down over them recovering : the parents and children were hit by another smaller on a different part of the wall but thankfully , the unidentified family appeared to be unhurt - even if they were left extremely wet			1
onlooker @entity76 , who was standing at a safe distance during the incident yesterday , said he was shocked to see the family exposing themselves to potential danger			0
' we could see the young family , a man and a woman with three or four kids in all , ' he said			2
' the man was lifting his little girl up against the railings so she could get a better view			0
' suddenly this huge wave came crashing over the harbour wall and knocked the dad off his feet			1
he fell back onto the ground , still clutching the girl - they were very close to being swept away			2
' the mother then ran over and grabbed the girl before they traipsed off looking drenched and rather sheepish			0
' anyone who knows the sea around here knows what it 's capable off so i 'm guessing they were from out of town			2
it was a ludicrous thing to do and incredibly dangerous			0
' reckless : three young men were seen standing on top of a sea wall in @entity18 , @entity15 today lucky : the boys were fortunate not to have been knocked off as huge waves broke around them the incident happened in the same harbour where a holidaying couple were swept to their deaths during a seaside stroll in 2007			1
elsewhere , sightseers who flocked to the coast to witness the dramatic scenes were ordered to move by officials amidst fears they were putting their own lives at risk			1
@entity128 called in the police to move on sightseers who turned out in large numbers at @entity133 , in south - west @entity134			2
the coastal town , which sits on a tidal estuary , was lashed by huge waves and winds of more than 70mph during the morning high tide			0
sightseers were using a car park close to the town 's @entity143 station which was a potentially dangerous area because of debris being thrown out of the sea			2
warnings : police and environmental officials are urging members of the public to stay away from the coast crashing : many people went to the shore to see the dramatic scenes for themselves a total of 21 severe flood warnings - suggesting conditions so bad that lives will be at risk - are in place across @entity40			1

waves of 30ft have been consistently hitting the coast since the pre-christmas storms			0
the waves are pushed in from the @entity174 and crash straight into the @entity175 off the @entity174			0
residents of low - lying areas have been warned to pack their bags because the violent @entity174 storm is expected to overwhelm large parts of the nationâ € ™ s battered flood defences			0
the @entity35 has issued 21 severe flood warnings for the @entity185 and western areas , warning residents of danger to life			2
some 437 less severe alerts were issued for other parts of the country as forecasters warned of winds of up to 60mph and days of rain .			0
