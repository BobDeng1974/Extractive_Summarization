to look at her , @entity0 would appear to be just a white - haired elderly woman , a grandmother to nine - and the last person in the world you ’d expect to cross the world chasing a dream			1
that was until the day two years ago when a chance glimpse at a tv programme made her jump out of her chair			0
@entity0 , 71 , is horse - mad , and has been fascinated with one particular breed since she was a little girl : the @entity18 , descendants of the horses ridden by the @entity22 tribe of @entity23			1
it was thought that there were fewer than 200 true @entity30 left in the world as cross-breeding has threatened their integrity			1
on her ranch in @entity44 , @entity0 has been breeding the real @entity45 since 1996			1
but on one fateful sunday in 2012 , @entity0 settled down to watch what she thought was going to be an old movie , @entity50			1
instead it was a repeat of @entity53 series , around @entity56 , in which former @entity55 analyst @entity54 travelled the globe buying and selling local commodities			1
the series , which first aired six years ago , showed him horse - trading in the former @entity61 republic of @entity62			1
@entity54 joined @entity0 on her quest after she saw him horse - trading in the former @entity61 republic of @entity62 on the @entity53 program @entity50 in 80 trades ‘ and then i stood up in my lounge and screamed my head off ... ’ recalled @entity0			1
for the horse that @entity54 had bought and called @entity71 was surely an @entity18			1
‘ he had everything an @entity18 should have			0
i was sure of it			0
’ most breeders would say that @entity30 arrived in @entity76 with the @entity78 conquistadors and made their way north			1
but @entity80 - born @entity0 always believed they came from @entity25 across the @entity81 between @entity82 and @entity83 , and that ’s why there were so many in the @entity86 , the home of the @entity22 tribe			1
‘ i thought , “ i ’ve got to get hold of this guy ! i ’ve got to convince him that he needs to go with me to @entity62 and find that horse			1
” ’ a flurry of emails followed			0
‘ i ’m not crazy , ’ @entity0 assured @entity54 , who lives in @entity94			1
‘ i ’m just trying to keep a wonderful breed alive – i need to find @entity71			2
’ if they succeeded , she argued , then dna tests might prove her theory about the breed ’s origins			2
so that was how @entity0 came to be flying to @entity103 , the capital of @entity62 , before setting off across @entity25 to make a film , @entity105 : quest for the @entity18 , shown on @entity107 tonight			1
@entity0 is looking into importing horses from @entity62 to @entity44 where she lives she had n’t met @entity54 until she arrived , but she did n’t have a moment ’s trepidation			1
‘ i was just so excited , so ready to go ! ’ her family , however – three grown - up daughters and a son – thought differently			0
her youngest daughter @entity117 , 28 , said , ‘ how can you even think about it ? you have grandchildren who will never know their grandmother ! ’ she said : ‘ the last words i heard at the airport from my grandson – he ’s the son of my other daughter , @entity125 – were , “ @entity126 says you ’re going to die ! ” ’ but @entity0 is fiercely individual			1
five - times married ( her first marriage lasted only a day , number four lasted three months ) refuses to stand any nonsense from husbands			0
‘ i wish i ’d married a cowboy , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m so horsey and none of my husbands were			0
’ nor was this her first big adventure			0
@entity0 was in her 50s when she moved from her remote home in @entity140 to @entity44			1
she was accompanied by two daughters , three horses including an @entity18 mare , two old @entity145 sheepdogs , a boat , a pick - up truck and a horse trailer			2
‘ we came to @entity44 sight unseen			2
so that was an adventure ! ’ filmmaker @entity54 had n’t a clue that @entity71 was special when , as one of his 80 trades , he bought him for the equivalent of £ 610 from local breeder @entity156			1
after an unsuccessful day trying to hack it as a horse dealer , he sold him on to a farmer for £ 500			2
but when @entity54 and @entity0 tracked down that farmer , with @entity156 ’s help , it turned out @entity71 had been sold a month later to a man in the same village			1
then he ’d been sold again , this time at market to an unknown buyer			0
an @entity18 horse with its distinctive black spotted white coat in a farm in @entity171 , @entity172 they ’d reached a dead end			2
‘ i was so upset , i cried for three days , ’ @entity0 said			2
appaloosas in the @entity80 cost up to $ 100,000 ( £ 64,000 )			0
@entity0 has refused an offer of $ 150,000 ( £ 99,000 ) for her stallion @entity179			2
but this was n’t about money			0
her dream was that by breeding from the purest appaloosas in the world , she could strengthen the bloodline			0
they had a stroke of luck when they attended an ancient horse game called @entity192 , @entity62 ’s national sport			1
like polo , highly skilled riders compete to drag a goat carcass into goal			0
there they learned about a remote valley where there were horses that sounded like @entity30			2
they spent three days driving , then onwards on horseback , sleeping rough in wolf country			0
at 4,200m @entity0 was clearly suffering from altitude sickness , though she insists it was just the flu			2
but then came the moment that made it all worthwhile : the first sighting of a herd of what were clearly @entity30			2
‘ it was so wonderful			0
i was so relieved to know they existed , ’ she said			0
locally , the horses are known as chaar , which means spotted			0
their nomadic owners said that during the @entity61 regime , the @entity83 tried to eradicate them by cross-breeding ; but in this remote valley they survived			0
their owners let them be dna tested , but @entity0 was already convinced , ‘ i thought , “ here ’s the true @entity18 ! ” ’ her instincts were confirmed when @entity54 turned up in @entity44 with the dna results			1
‘ i knew it ! ’ said @entity0			2
but she is n’t done yet			0
she ’s looking into importing horses from @entity62 to @entity44			1
‘ spending the kids ’ inheritance , ’ she said cheerfully			0
‘ i want to go back and pick out three good mares			0
i ’ve got 20 more years in me , at least .			0
