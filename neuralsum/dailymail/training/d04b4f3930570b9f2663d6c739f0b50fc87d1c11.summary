@entity0 enjoyed the luxury of a slap up breakfast before weighing in for his big fight with @entity5			1
@entity0 had woken in the morning more than half a pound under for the 10st 7lbs welterweight limit			1
that gave him the unusual indulgence of his pre-scale treat			0
he then came in exactly on the limit			0
my weight 's perfect and you 'll see that my strength and power has grown			0
' @entity5 was also right on the weight			2
the pair then exchanged some light banter			0
@entity0 told his opponent : ' i 'm from @entity32 but i 've got more fans than you in @entity35			2
i 'm going to win this in style			0
' @entity5 responded : ' you 've got to say that , in your mind you know i 'm going to beat you			2
you know you 're already beaten			0
' @entity0 , who 's fought once at welterweight , believes his power and strength has grown since moving to 147lbs @entity5 is adamant @entity0 knows he 's already a beaten man ahead of saturday 's bout the weigh - in took place in the @entity16 , where the fight itself will happen			1
this tradition began when @entity50 brought his blue @entity52 army to @entity17 for his fights with @entity54 and @entity55			1
then , and for subsequent @entity54 and @entity55 fights , this ritual has been almost as crowded as the fights themselves			1
former boxer @entity50 ( right ) has fought @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 in the past @entity50 was roared on in the ring by thousands of @entity62 fans in both fights at the @entity16 by comparison the @entity64 was more like a platoon but they still kicked up a din			1
the upper tier of the arena has been curtained off			0
but while @entity19 's @entity20 are clearly not expecting a sell - out they are predicting a healthy attendance			2
of the possibility of going to fight @entity54 if he wins , @entity0 said : ' a lot of people are saying now that it may well happen but i 'm concentrating on beating @entity77 and then we 'll see how it falls			1
' @entity80 will be televised live on @entity81 late this saturday night .			0
