by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 15 july 2013 the cousin of a four - year - old girl who was kidnapped and murdered 16 years ago has launched a @entity4 page in the hope of finally solving the grisly crime			1
@entity7 , 35 , believes that reminding people on social media about @entity10 and her 1997 death could jog the memory of someone who may know anything about the killing			2
' it only takes one small , or seemingly small , detail to blow this cold case wide open , ' @entity7 told @entity19			0
' i do n't want people to forget her			0
' the four - year - old girl vanished from her home in @entity23 , @entity24 on july 1 , 1997 as she played outside while her mother was in the shower			1
mystery : @entity10 , 4 , was kidnapped and murdered in 1997 - and her killer has never been found when her mother realized the little girl was gone , she frantically searched the neighborhood with friends and residents before alerting the police			1
friends handed out hundreds of flyers , restaurant employees wore t - shirts printed with her image and delivery vehicles pasted her photograph in their windows - but there was no sign of her			0
nine months later , on april 2 , 1998 , her skeletal remains were found by a highways worker cleaning out a ditch in @entity46			1
clothes resembling what she had been wearing were found nearby			0
but her body was so badly decomposed and exposed to the elements that dna evidence was unable to pinpoint her killer			0
no one has ever been charged with her death			0
innocence : her cousin , @entity7 ( both pictured ) , set up a @entity4 page to reinvigorate the search ripped apart : @entity7 , left , said she does n't want people to forget her cousin , right , who would be 20 today her face appeared on @entity65 and @entity66 , and sparked tips from as far away as @entity68			1
former @entity23 police sgt. @entity69 , who has since retired , previously told @entity19 that authorities received a tip that she was possibly taken by a man in @entity75			2
an investigator looked into the tip , and found a girl that looked just like @entity10 - but she was missing the young girl 's gap between her teeth			0
as the years passed , tips became less frequent and other homicide cases meant that @entity23 investigators were unable to devote time to @entity10 's case			1
adorable : the little girl was snatched from outside her home and her remains were found nine months later missed : police have received tips from all over the country but 16 years on , her killer has still not been found in november 2012 , @entity7 launched the @entity4 page , justice for @entity10 , and it has received more than 2,000 likes			1
she is hoping that the @entity4 page will remind people of the case and be able to gather any information people have about the case			1
sgt. @entity106 with the @entity23 police said the investigation is still open and that tips continue to trickle in - even as recently as the end of last year			2
authorities still have not determined how @entity10 died due to the decomposition of her body , but @entity106 said he believes she was asphyxiated			0
hope : @entity7 hopes the @entity4 page will encourage people to come forward with information solving these types of cases relies heavily upon people coming forward , he said			2
' relationships change , ' he told @entity19			0
' someone could come forward and spill their guts			0
' anyone with information on @entity10 's disappearance or death is asked to contact @entity23 police at 810 - 237 - 6800			2
visit the @entity4 page , justice for @entity10 .			1
