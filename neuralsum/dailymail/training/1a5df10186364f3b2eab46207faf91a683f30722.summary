by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 14:08 est , 13 april 2013 @entity2 @entity1 discovered he was allergic to beer after taking an allergy test a pub landlord who tastes ales for a living has discovered he is allergic to beer			1
@entity1 was the first in the @entity9 to qualify as a beer sommelier after it became a recognised qualification two years ago			1
however , after working in the pub industry for more than 20 years , he was devastated to find out he could n't stomach beer any longer			1
@entity15 took a home intolerance test after feeling unwell for months but was shocked to find that this was all down to the yeast in beer			1
@entity15 , 49 , said : ' i almost wanted to double check it and get it changed ! ' i did n't think it was right , i just did n't believe it			0
' i was coughing a lot and spluttering in the mornings , and generally feeling tired and lethargic			1
' i would n't have done anything about it if other people had n't complained - it was my family that made me find out because i had just accepted i was n't very well			2
' i was worried about what i was n't going to be able to have but i never thought it would be beer			0
the father - of - three earns a living by travelling around the country , taste - testing beer			1
he said : i 'm in the pub for work three or four days a week and it 's rare that i do n't have a drink for work purposes 3 or 4 times a week			2
' sometimes i can drink up to six ales in a pub. ' @entity1 's work involves reviewing beer and matching specific ales to different foods			1
he added : ' beer is a big part of my life and i just cant avoid it , i 'm heavily involved in the pub industry , i just love it			2
' it 's a great job - it 's hard work but i feel i 'm lucky to be able to visit pubs and help them through their beer			2
' worrying times : the father - of - three travels across the @entity9 taste testing beer for a living @entity1 , from @entity65 , @entity66 , used an at - home @entity68 kit which showed he suffered a severe reaction to yeast , which is found in many of the things he enjoys every day			1
he said : ' it 's in beer , wine , bread , even salad dressing			0
' it could have been caused by drinking too much of it			0
i mainly drink ales and they are very heavily yeasted so i may have just overloaded my body			0
' mr @entity1 owns the @entity84 and @entity85 bar in @entity86 , @entity87 ( pictured ) along with another bar in @entity89 but as beer is essential to his job , @entity15 has been forced to take on a new approach to get him through the working week			1
' i now sip not sup , that 's more difficult than you think because you have to properly drink ales to decipher the full flavour			0
' you ca n't just swill it round your mouth and spit it out like you can do with wine			0
' i 'm just going to have a bit now though rather than drinking full pints ! ' despite the allergy mr @entity1 claims he will carry on drinking beer in smaller amouts @entity15 , who owns two pubs in @entity89 and @entity86 , has had to change what he drinks socially because of his new - founded allergy			1
' @entity110 ale was always my favourite beer but it has a very large amount of yeast in it so i 've now switched to drinking lager			2
' i spoke to @entity116 who told me there are only trace amounts of wheat in most lagers as they are so heavily filtered , so they should n't affect me			0
' i would rather cut out bread than beer and , i just love it that much			0
' i 'm hoping if i can stay off it for the summer , then i might be able to see how it goes ! '			0

@entity1 took home allergy test after feeling tired and unwell
the pub landlord was shocked when he discovered he was allergic to wheat - a key *ingredient* in beer
but the *defiant* ale lover *insists* he will continue to drink
