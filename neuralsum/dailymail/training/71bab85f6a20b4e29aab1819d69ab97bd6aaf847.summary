@entity23 ’s biggest supermarket has also pledged to improve quality and bring forward a refurbishment of hundreds of its ‘ big box ’ stores			0
it will spend millions developing its website which is now generating food sales of £ 2.5billion a year and a trading profit of £ 127million			2
this will involve opening hundreds of new ‘ click and collect ’ points for food and other web purchases in stations and other locations			2
the moves come as the company tries to turn around a slump in sales and market share with shoppers deserting to cheaper budget rivals – @entity46 and @entity47 – as well as @entity48			1
chief executive @entity3 told investors that the company had failed to change fast enough to help the ‘ squeezed middle ’ and low income households during the financial crisis			1
‘ it has been tough for consumers and it ’s been tough for the company			1
our headline results are not where we want them to be , ’ he said			0
‘ i have not seen such a level and sustained pressure on consumers in my 40 years			2
there are signs of confidence in the @entity23 economy but consumers are not yet seeing that being translated into spending power			2
‘ the least affluent customers and middle income families are being forced to make choices			2
’ he added : ‘ businesses which do n’t change with the times do n’t succeed and we did not change enough , not enough for our customers			0
but now we have changed			0
’ cuts : it comes as @entity4 has announced it will cut prices on everyday food essentials by some £ 200million mr @entity3 said the giant , which takes around 30p in the £ 1 of all spending on groceries , had wrongly become locked into a mindset that ‘ big is best ’			1
he said the firm ’s bosses now accept this is not automatically the case			0
in fact , sales through its big stores were down by 3.1per cent in the crucial @entity95 period			0
as a result , it has decided to dramatically cut back on building new stores and will , instead , divert cash into major refurbishments			0
the success of the price cuts initiative will depend on whether customers trust the store to deliver this will include installing coffee shops , family restaurants and bakery shops into many of its biggest large stores , using the brands , @entity113 & @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
prototype stores in @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , which also have @entity122 fashion boutiques , pharmacies and opticians , will be used as the templates for the new look interiors			0
the company opened some 2.5million square feet of new floor space in this country in 2012 - 13 , however that will come down to just 700,000 in 2014/15			1
most of this new space will be in convenience stores as people switch away from one big weekly shop to making several trips			0
mr @entity3 said the company will do away with ‘ frivolous ’ price promotions to a regime of permanent lower prices on food essentials bought every week			1
he said : ‘ prices must get better and must be more stable			0
frivolous promotions must end and trusted ones should be in place and that will start now			0
’ the success of the price cut initiative will depend on whether customers trust the store to deliver			1
the firm promised reductions of £ 500m in the ‘ @entity153 ’ in 2011 , however subsequent surveys found many of the reductions were not what they seemed			0
mr @entity3 said he had he regretted the way that promotion was implemented , saying : ‘ it was not executed well			2
’ he insisted the company has now undergone a fundamental change in philosophy , adding : ‘ people will not be fooled and we are going to deliver what we have said			0
’ competition : shoppers are increasingly deserting @entity4 in favour of budget rivals @entity46 ( pictured ) and @entity47 the @entity23 managing director , @entity170 , said price cuts on everyday essential foods have been brought forward specifically to match the low figures at firms like @entity46 and @entity47			1
the national @entity21 scheme , which will be a permanent money - saving measure , has proved popular during trials in @entity177 and @entity178			1
customers who spend £ 20 earn a discount of 1p a litre on fuel at @entity4 petrol stations			1
drivers can choose to save up their discount over several shops to the point that they might earn a saving of as much as 20p a litre .			0
