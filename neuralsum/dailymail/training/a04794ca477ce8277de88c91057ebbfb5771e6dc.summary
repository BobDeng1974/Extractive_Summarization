@entity8 , the new president of the @entity9 , has said that parents who shell out for private tutors are paying as much for their child 's education as those who send them to private school ( file picture ) mr @entity8 is the principal of @entity34 's school in @entity35 and is the first man to be appointed to the post of president of the @entity9			1

he said : ' it 's going back to the old 1970s class war , it 's so outdated , the reference to the independent sector as that type of elite and privilege			0
' my school , like many , many other @entity9 schools , are real world schools where mum and dad are working very hard to prioritise their income to benefit their children			0
' and it 's funny , i would say 80 per cent of the social apartheid one sees in schools at the moment is actually because of geography , and some parents can access incredible education and incredibly successful schools because they can afford incredibly expensive housing in expensive areas of the country			0
' there is a question over what is the greatest privilege - paying school fees or moving into an expensive area			0
' some parents will actually prioritise their household income in order to make significant sacrifices to send their children to independent school , other parents will choose to look at geographical locations of where to buy and will be able to afford incredibly expensive housing in what they consider to be a far better school area			0
mr @entity8 is the principal of @entity83 in @entity35 and says that referring to independent schools as bastions of ' elite and privilege ' is outdated ' they supplement this with tutors and extra lessons in all sorts of other activities			1

one of his aims this year , he said , is to encourage greater engagement between fee - paying schools and government , adding that the independent sector is an important part of education in the @entity21			0
he added : ' i actually think , for example , this constant bashing that we 're getting to start academies , a good number of our schools do that , and are doing it very successfully , but that 's only scratching the surface , that 's only part of the picture			0
