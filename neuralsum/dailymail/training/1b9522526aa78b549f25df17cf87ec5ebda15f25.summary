professor @entity0 said he would be unhappy if one of his relatives was admitted at the weekend because of a shortage of consultants the @entity6 chief responsible for @entity8 services has said he would be unhappy if one of his own relatives was admitted to hospital over the weekend – because of a shortage of consultants			1
professor @entity0 , who is leading a review of @entity16 ’s accident and emergency departments , said his concerns were shared by other senior medical staff			1
he said : ‘ all consultants recognise there is vulnerability in hospitals over the weekend , and i would challenge any consultant not to have a degree of anxiety if one of their own relatives was admitted to hospital at a weekend , knowing the amount of current senior involvement there is			1
’ he added : ‘ at the moment we see patients taking up hospital beds at weekends , essentially treading water with no progressive treatment or diagnostics and few options to be discharged			1
’ campaigners last night called for greater investment in out - of - hours care to end the healthcare lottery , following professor @entity0 ’s admission on the @entity16 website			1
@entity48 , of the @entity49 ’ @entity47 , said : ‘ if even the head of our @entity8 departments is concerned for his family , then alarm bells should be ringing			2
‘ far too much money is wasted in the @entity6 and this leaves essential , frontline services stretched			2
it ’s crucial that this waste is cut out so that taxpayers ’ hard - earned cash is spent on ensuring patients get high - quality treatment at all times			0
’ earlier this year , a study revealed patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a monday – partly because fewer consultants were on duty			1
professor @entity70 is leading a review into @entity16 's accident and emergency departments and an investigation by the @entity75 last month revealed that only five consultants work overnight in @entity8 across the whole of @entity16			1
but the @entity78 , which represents senior doctors , said the @entity6 simply can not afford to provide the same level of service at weekends			0
professor @entity0 disagrees and claims a seven - days - a - week operation could actually save the @entity6 money			1
referring to his experience working in @entity85 almost two decades ago , he said : ‘ we showed how a seven - day service could be highly efficient and cost - effective			0
we reduced admissions and shortened length of stay			0
’ he added : ‘ we found that we were able to close down the number of beds – in fact it was reduced by 25 per cent – and that meant we released nursing costs , with that money going into the extra physiotherapy support we needed at weekends			2
’ the government wants to improve staffing levels and the availability of @entity6 services at weekends following concerns that patients are dying due to poor standards			0
last week dr @entity106 , who oversees the health service in @entity108 , said there were times of the day when patients were at risk because staff were spread too thinly			0
he warned that hospitals in the capital were ‘ at breaking point ’ and admitted senior managers were constantly ‘ trying to patch up ’			2
in september , an investigation found @entity8 departments are being left in the hands of junior doctors between midnight and 8am , overseen by a handful of slightly more experienced medics – many of whom are locums			0
but dr @entity126 , chairman of the @entity78 consultants ’ committee , said senior doctors were available at weekends as part of an ‘ on call ’ rota under their normal contract .			0
