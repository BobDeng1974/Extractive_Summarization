@entity1 patients on the waiting list for vital transplants could be sent to the back of the queue if the country votes for independence			1
@entity9 officials today warned that the current system for treatment would have to be completely re-written in the event of a win for the @entity15 campaign			2
this mean patients currently on the waiting list could face an even longer delay for life - saving heart , lung and liver transplants			1
a @entity24 @entity23 spokesman said : ' @entity1 residents receive treatments in @entity35 including for a range of specialised services such as heart , lung and liver transplant procedures			1
' it can not be assumed that all existing arrangements between the @entity43 and the @entity44 in other parts of the @entity24 would necessarily continue in their current form - for example , those whereby @entity48 allocates organs for transplant on a @entity24 - wide basis			2
' @entity1 residents currently have access to more than 40 specialist treatments in @entity35 for rare conditions			2
there are currently more than 500 @entity1 patients awaiting a transplant			1
the future of the @entity44 has been one of the central issues to the debate over independence , with each side offering different visions for its future			0
currently there are more than 500 patients in @entity1 who need a transplant , and could face a longer delay if the country becomes independent labour leader @entity71 said this weekend that a @entity15 vote meant taking a ' risk ' on the future of @entity44 services in @entity1 the @entity77 campaign insists that funding from @entity24 tax - payers is vital for the current level of service to be maintained , while the @entity82 dismiss this as scare - mongering and argue @entity44 services in @entity1 as part of the @entity24 would be vulnerable to cuts to services			1
labour leader @entity71 this weekend stressed the impact independence could have on the @entity44 during a better together rally in @entity90			0
mr @entity71 claimed £ 1 billion could be slashed from its budget - the cost of employing 36,000 nurses - under independence			0
he said @entity22 's ' lack of a currency plan ' could lead to £ 21 billion of spending cuts in an independent @entity1 , according to @entity100 governor @entity99			1
the @entity102 leader said : ' be in no doubt what this means : over £ 1 billion a year would be the @entity44 's share of those cuts , the equivalent of 36,000 nurses			0
that is the real threat to @entity44			0
' when better , faster , safer change is coming , that 's not a risk anyone who loves the @entity44 should take			0
