albino croc @entity17 maul @entity15 , 57 , to death in august in 2014 , the @entity3 crocodile management team removed 287 saltwater crocodiles from the territory 's waterways , up from 226 in 2013			1
wildlife ranger @entity23 said last year 's number was close to toppling the most number of crocodiles ever caught , which is 318 in 2012			2
2014 's numbers meant more than five saltwater crocodiles were removed from the @entity30 's waterways every week			2
mr @entity23 told @entity31 last year 's number of crocodile deaths were concerning			0
this also comes as a significant number of saltwater crocodiles were captured by the @entity3 's @entity13 ' this is the highest number of fatalities in one year since it 's been recorded , ' he said			1
january june august most of those deaths were due to negligence in crocodile - infested waters , mr @entity23 said , and it was possible residents were becoming complacent , with more people out on the waterways , and high crocodile numbers			0
' we 're trying to get the @entity50 message across as best as possible , but unfortunately we will get another [ death ] , we just do n't know when , ' he said			0
' stay away from the water , do n't put your hands near the water , use hooks or nets to retrieve fish from the water			0
' when you 're fishing from the banks stay five metres back from the water 's edge , do n't have your camp close to the water			0

the largest crocodile caught in 2014 was 4.75m long at @entity69 - south of @entity67 - on december 16			0
but mr @entity23 hosed down speculation about a cull , saying it was a decision to be made by the federal government , which listed saltwater crocodiles as a protected species in 1971			2
it could negatively impact the @entity3 crocodile industry , which is worth about $ 20 million per year , he said , and could lull people into a false sense of security .			0
