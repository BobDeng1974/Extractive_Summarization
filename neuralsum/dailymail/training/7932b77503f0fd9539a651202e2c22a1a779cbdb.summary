@entity1 ’s vision of fast - paced goal gluts from his @entity4 side seems light years away , rather than one threatening to put in an appearance at some stage of 2015			1
four days shy of the turn of this year of change and during a time of transition for the @entity14 champions , @entity8 were able to dig in for a draw thanks to gutsy defending and @entity4 ’s shocking creative shortcomings			1
at least january 1 will open up the market for @entity1 to go shopping for inspiration			2
for that was sadly lacking in this dismal display that wo n’t bring the crowds back to @entity23 any time soon			2
@entity8 's @entity24 ( left ) and @entity4 's @entity26 tussle for possession during the first half @entity29 lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the match that ended goalless at @entity23 @entity4 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 9 ) , @entity26 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 67 ) , @entity41 ( commons 67 )			1
subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			2
@entity8 : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 90 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity24 , @entity60 ( @entity61 38 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 90 )			1
subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity39			2
booked : @entity53 , @entity59 , @entity51 , @entity56			0
referee : @entity68 ( @entity69 )			0
it ’s a sorry state of affairs when the day ’s positive for the grumbling @entity4 support was points dropped at @entity73 by closest - pursuers @entity75			1
@entity4 extended their lead to five points thanks to @entity79 ’s victory — a gap sure to be targeted now by an @entity82 outfit offered encouragement about mounting a challenge by this blunt effort			1
this was a @entity8 team that @entity4 slammed five past in october at @entity89 at a canter , a fact that asks yet more questions of the signs of progress @entity1 claims to be witnessing during his working week			1
they have disappeared at the weekends , clearly , and on this form , the trip to @entity99 on thursday could be as tricky as a few of the old traditional @entity103 derbies staged on @entity104			0
@entity106 ’s men , now without a victory in six , have never won at @entity23 and only with one crack at goal from @entity110 with six minutes remaining did they flirt with the upset of the season			0
even their joy at this superb result was diluted by dropping to the foot of the table on account of @entity119 ’s victory , but this point could prove a precious one come may if they can start scoring wins against their bottom - six rivals			1
@entity124 ( left ) salutes the home fans as @entity43 rues another golden opportunity to score the stalemate was secured despite personnel problems			0
@entity129 being ineligible to play against his parent club forced @entity131 into one of his four plotted changes			0
that soon became five when a back spasm felt by @entity136 in the morning got no better from a combination of medication and a warm - up			0
his replacement , @entity141 , lasted all of 38 minutes before hobbling off himself			0
following a minute ’s silence for the victims of the @entity146 bin lorry accident , @entity1 began the bid to tease more goals from his side by fielding three strikers			0
@entity26 was rewarded for his scoring cameo in defeat at @entity153 with a first @entity14 start since august 23 , alongside @entity40 and misfiring @entity43			1
that three became a two when @entity40 succumbed to an early calf problem and @entity41 was introduced after only nine minutes			0
yet for the bulk of the contest , the on - loan @entity156 was up top on his own with the curiously ineffective @entity42 his closest support act , while @entity26 remained a non-factor on the flank			2
@entity43 was clearly greedy to get back among the goals as he grabbed the chances to let fly from free - kicks			0
he ruffled the side - netting rather than the @entity8 keeper , who was drawn to make a save only once in the first half			1
it was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as referee @entity68 tried to keep the peace the defensive banks brought south to keep @entity4 out were solid in their deployment , such a contrast to that 5 - 0 thumping two months ago , and great credit to @entity54 , @entity24 and company for limiting @entity4 opportunities			1
even on the occasions @entity4 succeeded in stringing together a menacing move , there was always a boot or , in the case of @entity59 , a hand in the way to stall what momentum the home side had mustered			1
the battle for a point was then fuelled by injustice			0
@entity37 was on a yellow card when committing a bookable offence as @entity8 broke with the tireless @entity62 , and the visitors made their feelings known to referee @entity68			1
@entity4 were making hard work of it with 11 men , so quite how they would have constructed a swashbuckling attack with 10 is not something the home fans would ’ve wished to consider during their half - time break			1
@entity41 took early and ambitious aim at breaching @entity8 ’s resilience , cleverly carving out space for a 25 - yard drive that cannoned off the crossbar			2
@entity43 ’s poor form stalked the follow - up as the @entity156 stumbled into the rebounding ball and missed the open goal with the keeper floored			0
@entity4 fans hold up a banner during a minute 's silence for the victims of the bin lorry crash in @entity103 the @entity4 players take part in the silence dedicated to those killed and injured by the out - of - control bin lorry the toils of @entity4 begged for significant change and there was no surprise when @entity43 made way for @entity44			1
after netting 11 in 10 , @entity43 is now without a goal in five			0
@entity41 , meanwhile , was dealt the insult of being a substituted substitute as @entity232 appeared in his place for what was meant to shape up as a late assault on @entity51 ’s goal			0
yet they offered no signs of being an upgrade in creative or clinical terms and , a quarter of an hour later , the next chance of the game fell to the visitors			0
on the break , @entity59 cracked a 20 - yard drive off the base of the post with @entity33 at full stretch , to the relief of the @entity4 support			2
the first scoreless league draw at @entity23 since october 2011 was greeted by jeers — an understandable reaction from a dejected home crowd .			2

@entity4 are still top of the @entity14 after draw with @entity8
the draw means the @entity8 are bottom after @entity119 's win at @entity75
@entity4 are now five points clear at the top of the @entity264 top flight
