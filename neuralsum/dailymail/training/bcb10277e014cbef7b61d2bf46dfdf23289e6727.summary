' not the answer ' : locking up more criminals is a ‘ sign of failure ’ @entity4 , pictured , will say locking up more criminals is a ‘ sign of failure ’ @entity4 will say today			2
the @entity9 leader will use a speech to insist that prison is ‘ not the answer ’ for many offenders and will outline reforms to cut the number of women , people with mental health problems and drug users behind bars			1
he will call for greater use of tagging and community service , adding : ‘ simply locking up more and more people is not a sign of success , it ’s a sign of failure			1
’ mr @entity4 will say ‘ dangerous , serial criminals ’ should go to jail , but that for ‘ vulnerable women , addicts and people with mental health problems , prison is n’t working ’			1
he will add : ‘ there are more than 85,000 people in prison in @entity39 and @entity40 today			2
in 1994 , there were fewer than 49,000			0
‘ i do n’t believe there are 36,000 more dangerous people now than then			0
we have not become a more vicious or sinister society			0
’ he will say : ‘ simply locking up more and more people is not a sign of success it ’s a sign of failure			0
’ the speech will be seen as a strong indication that the @entity9 will seek to slash the prison population if they end up in a new coalition government after the election			1
last year , @entity9 justice minister @entity56 said he wanted to abolish jail sentences of less than a year			1
mr @entity4 will also say the @entity58 – which handles offenders aged up to 18 – should be extended so it deals with all offenders up to the age of 21			0
but this will raise fears that more young adult offenders will be let out on the streets or given reprimands or other ‘ soft ’ punishments instead of being locked up			0
last night , a @entity69 source said one of the reasons for the rise in the prison population recently is the growing number of convicted sex offenders			1
the source said : ‘ surely the @entity9 would n’t say they should be anywhere else but behind bars ? ’ justice secretary @entity78 said : ‘ under this government , crime is down and our communities are safer			1
if we have to send more people to prison to achieve that , so be it			0
‘ @entity86 works – i ’m clear about that			0
but we also have a duty to make sure it works better at rehabilitating offenders so that do n’t keep coming back time and again			0
’ mr @entity4 will say fewer women , people with mental health problems and drug users should be jailed , and complain that they are being ‘ crammed like sardines into crowded prisons ’ ( file image ) mr @entity4 will say fewer women , people with mental health problems and drug users should be jailed , and complain that they are being ‘ crammed like sardines into crowded prisons ’			1
he will say : ‘ dangerous , serial criminals ’ should go to jail , but that for ‘ vulnerable women , addicts and people with mental health problems prison is n’t working			1
‘ we want to end the revolving door that sees offenders leave prison with no help and no hope , only to return to their cell a few weeks later			2
‘ and if your only crime is possession of drugs for personal use , we want to see you in treatment or education , not a prison cell ’			2
mr @entity4 will insist that his proposed reforms will ‘ make us safer ’			0
last year , mr @entity56 said there should be a legal presumption that no - one should go to jail for less than 12 months , and instead criminals should be given community or suspended sentences			2
that would mean 60,000 fewer criminals going to prison every year – including thousands of violent thugs , burglars , sex attackers and robbers			0
over time , it would lead to the halving of the current prison population of nearly 85,000 , leaving tens of thousands of repeat criminals on the streets instead of behind bars .			1
