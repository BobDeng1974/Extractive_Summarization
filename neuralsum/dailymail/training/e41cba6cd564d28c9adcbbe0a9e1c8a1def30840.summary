@entity6 , 44 , devoured the cheese and onion flavoured snacks along with four burgers , bacon , fried eggs , countless biscuits , an entire loaf of bread and two litres of @entity15 or coke every 24 hours			1
mature student @entity6 struggled to walk and could not climb a flight of stairs to make it to his college classes to study for a @entity21 ( @entity21 ) in multimedia technology and web design former fitness trainer who ballooned to 27 stone after developing an addiction to crisps that saw him eat 20 packets every day			1
when doctors told him his lifestyle would kill him , he finally shed 14 stone - and now weighs in at 13st 10lbs but after being told by doctors his lifestyle would kill him @entity6 , with the help of staff at @entity36 , shed 14 stone and a year later weighs in at 13 stone 10 pounds			1
@entity6 said the weight loss also meant @entity6 graduated from college and is now studying for a degree in the same subject			1
father - of - four @entity6 said : ' i loved cheese and onion crisps			1
i could easily go through 20 packs in a day on top of all the fried food			0
' it got to the point where i could n't walk up the flight of stairs to get to class , i think it would have killed me and i definitely would n't have finished the first year , never mind be doing a degree			1
at his largest , @entity6 weighed almost 28 stone and could not climb a flight of stairs at the colelge he attended ' i feel fantastic now , absolutely great			1
i 'm a totally different person and i have n't touched a bag of crisps in over a year			0
' i ate one to celebrate hitting my weight loss target and it was horrible , i did n't like the taste at all			0
' grandfather - of - one @entity6 , who lives with his wife @entity63 , 46 , in @entity64 , @entity65 , began to pile on the pounds after leaving his job as a fitness instructor at the @entity68 , to manage a video rental shop in the early 1990s			1
the slow - down in activity and hours spent sat behind a counter saw @entity6 eat more and exercise less			1
over the next 20 years he moved from job to job in various high street shops until he hit the age of 40 when he left to study at college			0
as well as the crisps , @entity6 ' diet consisted of four burgers , bacon , fried eggs , biscuits , an entire loaf of bread and two litres of @entity15 or coke every 24 hours the student lifestyle meant @entity6 gained weight even quicker as his diet deteriorated into a sea of fast food , fried breakfasts and salty snacks			1
at his heaviest @entity6 weighed 27 stone seven pounds and struggled to walk			1
@entity6 began to realise the seriousness of the situation when he tried to buy a kilt to attend a wedding and found his bulging 62 inch waist was one inch short of needing a specially made garment			1
but even that was n't enough for him to ditch his snack filled diet			0
@entity6 said : ' i would buy the big multi-packs of crisps and they would all disappear			1
' i would get annoyed and ask my family who had eaten them all , but then i realised all the empty packets were down the side of my chair , because i had eaten the lot			0
' my diet was dreadful , breakfast would be four pieces of bread , two eggs and three sausages followed by biscuits and crisps			0
' for dinner i would have four burgers , half a plate of chips and a tin of beans or a large curry			2
' i had visited doctors who told me that if i did n't lose weight i would probably die but that did n't stop me			0
' the turning point came when i started going to college			0
i would take the lift because i could n't manage the stairs			2
' in march last year @entity6 decided to change his life and ate his last bag of crisps			2
he joined a weight loss class at @entity64 's @entity140 and began to exercise			0
in just six months he lost seven and a half stone , by nine months he had shed another five in time for the completion of his hnd course in november last year			0
he reached his target last month and said he is determined to continue his healthy lifestyle and shed a few more pounds before his graduation from the @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149 , later this year			0
@entity6 added : ' it just shows what you can do			2
' i 'm no longer on blood pressure tablets and i 'm really happy with the way i look			2
' it 's given me a new lease of life , some people walk by me and do n't realise it 's me			0
' and i do n't miss crisps at all			0
