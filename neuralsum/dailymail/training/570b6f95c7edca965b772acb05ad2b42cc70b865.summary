the @entity2 ’s @entity1 @entity0 scored his first goal for @entity4 but it was not enough to give @entity7 ’s team the advantage in the @entity9 as @entity10 equalised from a corner with three minutes left			1
it was more a game of two days than two halves with the 11pm local time kick - off meaning the match started on tuesday and finished on wednesday and it was on ' day two ' that the goals came			2
@entity4 could have won it with their last attack when @entity19 blocked @entity22 ’s goal - bound shot with his hand but @entity24 held on for the draw			1

yellow cards : @entity44 , @entity73 , @entity19			0
goal : @entity10 88 the game , played so late because of @entity4 ’s suffocating august heat , was a scrappy affair with @entity24 frustrating their big spending neighbours			1
the match was only four minutes old when @entity44 went into the book as he went in late on @entity58 and the @entity4 defender exaggerated sufficiently to draw the card from the referee			1
if the first caution was harsh the second on the quarter hour was completely justified as @entity98 went high over the top of the ball on @entity52 leaving him needing treatment on the sidelines			0
@entity52 it was who had had @entity4 ’s first chance running on to @entity48 ’s pass but shooting wide of @entity71 ’s right - hand upright			1
against a full - back on a booking this early the night was shaping up nicely for the @entity110			0
he swept past @entity112 ’ replacement with another superb first touch as most of @entity4 ’s attacks flowed down the right hand - side			1
as badly as @entity98 was doing defensively he was able to threaten on the break and when he skipped past @entity22 he won a corner off of @entity26 but @entity4 are always dangerous on the break from defending corners and only a @entity55 challenged prevented @entity52 racing away to score			2
@entity45 then won two corners in quick succession but saw both cleared by the stubborn @entity24 defence			2
@entity61 then became the first @entity4 name to be taken for going through the back of @entity44 and cards continued to outnumber goal - scoring opportunities			1
one such chance came just before the break when @entity39 and @entity52 swapped wings and the former headed the latter ’s cross well wide			2
real coach @entity7 got the biggest cheer of the night with a perfect piece of control from another stray pass that had dropped into his technical area but it was cagey stuff from the visitors and there was no way through for the @entity146 champions			2
swinging back : @entity4 forward @entity39 has an effort from range as two @entity24 players seek to close him down silverware hunt : @entity39 was looking to help @entity4 win their second trophy of a possible six this season start the engines : @entity52 puts on the pace as he looks to speed past @entity24 man @entity44 in the first - half @entity39 was taken off at half time as a precaution for a problem in his left leg and @entity0 came on in his place			1
with the @entity162 international off @entity52 picked up the baton forcing a save from @entity71 at the start of the second half			0
having seen @entity7 put his big summer signing on at half time @entity168 waited just ten second half minutes before putting @entity75 on for @entity74			1
the tackles , meanwhile continued to fly in with @entity19 booked for a foul on @entity171 and @entity26 and @entity27 tangling with both going into the book			0
on 70 minutes @entity4 should have had the lead			2
@entity52 ’s free - kick was punched straight back into play by @entity71 but @entity60 blazed the loose ball over from the edge of the six - yard box			0
@entity0 then shot wide as @entity4 continued to press			1
finally with 15 minutes left @entity179 was brought on			0
@entity4 ’s best player last season forced an immediate corner after linking with @entity60 who had forced another save from @entity71 before the change			0
kroos it was he finally forced the opening goal			0
he played in @entity22 who crossed for @entity48 and when his shot was blocked the ball ran out to @entity0 who found the back of the net			0
the @entity192 's goal looked to have won it but from @entity44 ’s corner @entity10 was alone in the six - yard box to poke home past @entity57			1
it had not been pretty from @entity168 ’s league champions but they had done enough to take a draw into friday ’s home second leg			0
not looking good : forward @entity39 was brought off at half - time by @entity4 manager @entity7 aerial duel : @entity39 is beaten in the air by @entity24 midfielder @entity19 in the first - half of the first leg homage : both sides paid tribute to @entity4 legend @entity210 at the beginning of the game , as a string band play on the pitch tribute : @entity61 looks towards his team - mates as @entity4 clap during a homage to @entity210 before the game @entity4 better than before - @entity7			1

@entity39 is substituted for @entity0 at half - time , before @entity192 nets late goal in @entity9 first leg
the move from @entity7 was thought to be a precaution for a problem in his left leg
@entity24 equalise with just minutes remaining through @entity10 to level the tie at the @entity34
@entity4 looking to win second of six possible trophies this term heading into the return leg at @entity236
