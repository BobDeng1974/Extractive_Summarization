the personal data and private online conversations that the @entity2 is accused of mining could be stashed in a one million square - foot , $ 1.9 billion facility in the @entity6			1
concerns over what the government will store at the @entity10 have been reinvigorated by the revelation that @entity13 intelligence agencies have been extracting audio , video , photos , e-mails , documents and other information to track people 's movements and contacts			1
@entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and the lesser known internet company @entity31 are all involved with the @entity32 , which the government insists is for national security			2
the @entity10 which is being constructed on @entity35 on the @entity38 - @entity37 line will be completed in october - but officials have been tight - lipped about what will be stored there			1
more : the @entity10 , near @entity42 , was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the @entity2 was stored storage : an aerial photograph shows the center stash : the government has been tight - lipped about what will be stored in the center 's four ' data halls ' plans released by the @entity55 , which is handling the construction , show the center will have four ' data halls ' to store information and two substations to power the facility			1
the spy center is being built at an estimated cost of $ 1.9 billion , and is expected to employ 100 to 200 permanent employees after its completion			0
the plans note they must all be @entity13 citizens			0
despite the boom for the local economy , the @entity68 of @entity6 has expressed their fears over what will be stored at the center			1
' we 're mining data , we 're gathering data and it 's all done secretly , ' @entity68 of @entity6 director @entity74 told @entity79			1
' we do n't even know what 's going on			0
' plans : sketches released by @entity84 engineers show the massive center , which is believed to cost $ 1.7 billion will your information be in there ? another drawing shows halls where the data will be kept site : the center overlooks the @entity6 and will employ up to 200 people when it is complete ' when the @entity2 facility in @entity6 was announced , local officials praised it for the jobs it would bring , ' @entity97 director @entity96 added			1
' as @entity13 are now learning , those jobs entail harvesting the data generated by innocent @entity13 not suspected of any crime , in contradiction to the @entity106			2
' the fears come as the @entity108 reported that for the past six years , @entity13 intelligence agencies have been extracting personal information from across the country			1
the prism program was launched in 2007 with the blessing of special federal judges under the @entity115			0
the @entity108 said that several members of the @entity117 were made aware of the classified data - gathering program , but were sworn to secrecy			2
mystery : a close - up section of @entity2 's @entity10 is shown in @entity42 in july powerhouse : these images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of @entity127 customers , as well as data from companies including @entity24 and @entity26 @entity32 has been described by @entity2 officials ' as the most prolific contributor to the president 's @entity132 ' and the ' leading source of raw material ' , the @entity108 reported			1
on friday , president @entity136 delivered a passionate defense of national security programs that secretly acquire information about @entity13 ' phone calls , saying criticism of them is all ' hype			2
' ' my assessment and my team 's assessment was that [ the programs ] help us prevent terrorist attacks and that the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration [ of calls ] without a name attached ... it was worth us doing			0
' in practice , if collection managers in the @entity2 's @entity160 , which manages @entity32 , have suspicion that their target is a foreign national engaged in terrorism or a spy , they move ahead to draw in all the data which would often net in information on the suspect 's contacts			2
president @entity136 has maintained that data mining ' was worth us doing ' to halt national security threats bombshell : a leaked powerpoint slide shows how the @entity2 and @entity176 have been extracting audio , video , photos , e-mails , documents and other data from large @entity184 companies for six years ' i think it ’s important to understand that you ca n’t have 100 percent security and then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience , ' @entity136 said			1
' we ’re going to have to make some choices as a society			0
' @entity136 said the prism program does not involve monitoring the email content of @entity13 citizens or anyone living in the @entity13 , and he repeatedly stated that both programs - the phone spying and @entity32 - have been approved by @entity117			0
' you can complain about " big brother " and how this is a potential program run amuck , ' @entity136 added , ' but when you actually look at the details , then i think we 've stuck the right balance			0
' the @entity108 noted that the tech companies are knowingly taking part in @entity32 , but @entity210 , which also received a leaked @entity2 report , reported than all nine pleaded ignorance of the program			0
the companies denied any knowledge of the program , with spokespeople saying they had not even heard of it .			0
