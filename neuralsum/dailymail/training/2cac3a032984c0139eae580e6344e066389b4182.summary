the man in charge of curing cricket of corruption is adamant that he made the right decision in allowing convicted spot - fixer @entity5 to return to the game seven months ahead of the end of his five - year ban			1
sir @entity9 , chairman of the @entity11 ’s anti-corruption unit , insists that his controversial decision that opens up the possibility of @entity5 returning at the highest level against @entity15 in october will not set a dangerous precedent for other offenders			1
speaking ahead of the @entity20 , the former chief constable of the @entity19 took full responsibility for throwing the gifted but flawed @entity5 a lifeline but said he understands those who say he has been too lenient			1
@entity5 pictured in @entity24 last month			1
he is close to a possible return to competitive cricket after serving most of a five - year suspension for spot - fixing aamer in action for @entity31 against @entity15 at @entity32 in august 2010 before his five - year ban ‘ i fully respect the views of those who say that this should n't have happened but personally i ’m content that it was right , ’ said @entity9 here in @entity35			1
‘ he ’s returned to a level of domestic cricket with no input in the international sphere whatsoever seven months early			1
i ’m satisfied that the right thing was done			0
‘ we in anti-corruption in cricket say resolutely that we have zero tolerance and some people have said ‘ well , how can this come about then ? ’ i believe you can have zero tolerance but it does n’t mean the same punishment should apply to each incident			1
it ’s my discretion and i stand by it and take responsibility for it			0
’ @entity5 was one of the best young fast bowlers in the world when he was jailed along with his captain @entity62 and experienced colleague @entity63 after being caught by a @entity65 sting bowling no balls in the @entity67 against @entity15 on demand for money			1
he received more sympathy than his team - mates because it was widely felt he was manipulated by those in authority who should have known better but he was still banned for five years from having any involvement in the game			1
@entity5 was exposed for bowling no balls at specific times during @entity31 's test with @entity15 at @entity79 now @entity5 , still only 22 , has been cleared to play in @entity81 domestic cricket and has kept himself in good enough shape to have a realistic chance of being ready to play when @entity15 tour the @entity84 later this year			1
‘ it was after a very rigorous examination of the entire case and a thorough consideration of his personal input and reaction that this decision was made , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ did he plead guilty ? was he truly remorseful for what he ’d done ? the timing of that is important too			0
the process i went through and the decision i arrived at does not set any improper precedent for others			2
‘ i looked into it very carefully and have interviewed @entity5 several times and i ’m satisfied he met all the conditions			2
he has fully admitted his part in what happened , told us all he knows and was very co-operative with us			0
’ a crucial factor in @entity5 ’s partial amnesty was his willingness to take part in the @entity11 ’s education programme trying to stop others making the mistakes that cost him his freedom and a large chunk of a highly promising career			1
@entity5 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity118 during the @entity67 in june 2010 ‘ it ’s all very well being told not to do something by an ex-cop but i think it ’s something else all together to hear it from someone who was an international cricketer and fell from grace , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ he is saying to them ‘ please do n’t do what i did			0
’ i think that ’s a powerful message			0
‘ what has happened is that he can now engage in domestic cricket under the auspices of the @entity132 in @entity31			2
i ’m very comfortable that that ’s the right thing to do			0
he has made videos on our behalf that we have shown players highlighting exactly how he fell from grace and what happened to him			0
‘ he described how , when he won his first cap , he slept all night in his shirt that showed he was representing his country and what it meant for him and his family to fall from grace			0
whether he ’ll return to the international game depends on his ability and the @entity132			2
' if he should do and he continues to be that person who delivers that message to others that they should n’t put themselves in the position he put himself in then that is a very strong message			0
’ a shamed @entity5 arrives at @entity152 in @entity153 in november 2011			1
along with team - mates @entity62 and @entity63 , he was found guilty by the court of conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments during the @entity67 the distinguished senior policeman accepts that the battle against corruption in cricket is an ongoing one and had strong words for those who will attempt to manipulate and abuse the @entity20 which starts next week			0
‘ we know that there are rotten people out there , criminal people who will do all in their power to get at players and others of influence within the game , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ they ’ll trick them , coerce them and are almost like paedophiles in how they attempt to groom people into ultimately doing what suits their nefarious intentions			0
‘ we have gone to great lengths to ensure that they do n’t get their way and i ’m certain the players , officials and support staff will be working very carefully in support of what we are trying to do and we will be working in partnership to ensure that they never get their way			0
‘ i would like to assure the paying public that they will be coming to a tournament where all of those involved have done all in their power to ensure it is free from corruption or the threat of corruption			0
