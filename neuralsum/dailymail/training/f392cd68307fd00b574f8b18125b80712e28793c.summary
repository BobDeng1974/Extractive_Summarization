by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:13 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 06:04 est , 15 august 2013 the government has spent £ 800million calling in consultants to do the work of staff made redundant with pay - offs worth almost £ 300million			1
the revelation sparked claims @entity10 departments have ‘ let good people go ’ before rehiring former civil servants on expensive , temporary contracts			1
the spending also flies in the face of a ban on the use of external consultants as part of the government ’s austerity programme			2
revolving door : the government has spent almost £ 300million laying off staff , and up to £ 800million bringing in consultants the total pay - offs in 2012 - 13 to core staff at the 17 main central government departments was £ 290 million , @entity26 figures show			1
the data reveals the @entity31 recorded a high of £ 89 million in exit payments for staff in 2012 - 13 , followed by the @entity35 ' £ 67 million			1
but at the same time @entity10 departments paid out £ 505 million on consultants and short - term staff , listed as ‘ consultancy and contingent labour ’			1
analysis by @entity41 of the data placed the overall cost of consultants and temporary staff at nearer to £ 800 million for the 17 main departments			2
it includes private firms brought in to work on projects including @entity50 , @entity51 and the @entity53 railway , plus more than £ 328 million on ‘ off - payroll ’ staff			2
grip : @entity57 mp @entity56 said ministers had to do more to control spending @entity57 mp @entity56 told @entity41 : @entity60 , said : ‘ ministers need to get a grip on consultancy and temporary staff costs			0
‘ paying for these services should be the exception rather than the rule and @entity10 must restructure itself to bring these costs down			0
’ @entity69 , the @entity57 chairman of the @entity70 , added : ‘ we have let good people go as part of the downsizing - but how many of these consultants are ex-civil servants ? ’ in august 2012 @entity77 , @entity78 , claimed the last government used consultants as a ' comfort blanket ' , adding : ' if there was anything difficult to be done , they would reach for consultants immediately , which is both very expensive , but also it actually undermines the position of mainstream civil servants			1
’ the coalition , he added , was trying to reduce the dependence on consultants through trying to achieve a skills transfer from consultants used to civil servants , and knowing where existing skills were across @entity95			0
a @entity26 spokeswoman said : ‘ we 've already put an end to excessive consultancy spend by establishing stringent controls across @entity95 saving , over £ 1.6 billion in 2011/12 compared to the level of spending in 2009/10			0
‘ @entity26 delivers projects across a wide range of high - profile policy areas			0
‘ it is sometimes necessary to recruit for specialist business - critical roles			0
such roles are only authorised where the skills are not readily available within civil service and where using temporary labour is better value for taxpayers ' money than hiring full - time staff			0
‘ bringing in procurement , finance and digital expertise plays a crucial part in our determination to strengthen the corporate centre in @entity10 and ensuring that government operates like the best - run businesses			2

@entity10 *accused* of ' letting good people go ’ before calling in consultants
pay - offs in 2012 - 13 hit £ *290million* as part of cost - cutting programme
but millions more was spent on external firms on temporary contracts
