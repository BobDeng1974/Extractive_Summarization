@entity1 manager @entity0 has encouraged @entity2 to aim for a place in @entity6 ’s @entity5 squad for the @entity7 this summer			1
the tricky winger scored and set up another in @entity1 ’s win which left @entity10 deep in the relegation quagmire			1
when the debate rages about who should play in the @entity17 tournaments , @entity13 managers often prefer their stars to skip them			2
@entity2 celebrates with @entity1 team - mates after his opener at @entity21 on saturday @entity22 made his first @entity13 start for 770 days			1
but @entity0 has taken the unusual step of backing @entity25 for the tournament and will speak to @entity6 about including him			2
‘ i would love @entity27 to be on that trip because that is a big tournament for @entity5 , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ particularly after the @entity30 results this year and @entity5 did n’t do well in the @entity31 so i think @entity6 should have the best players available and i ’m hoping @entity27 is one of them			1
but @entity6 ’s choice wo n’t be determined by a phone call from me , he is his own man			2
‘ @entity27 has definitely found himself a little bit more and i think @entity6 would like somebody in the squad who has the kind of quality that he does			2
but he ’s got to do it between now and the end of the year and push for a place in that squad — that should be a goal for him			0
’ @entity25 ’s counterpart on the opposite flank @entity51 also starred in the victory , twice beating @entity10 ’s teenage right - back @entity53 to get to the byline and send in low crosses — one for @entity25 ’s goal and the other for @entity58 to score			1
@entity25 slides in to open the scoring during the 3 - 1 win over relegation threatened @entity10 @entity53 was run ragged and eventually hooked at the break			1
@entity51 admitted he targeted the 19 - year - old as a weak link in the team			2
‘ my aim was to go at him straight away , ’ he said			0
‘ he ai n’t going to come here and i ’m not going to let him settle , so that was my aim to be honest			0
i know it ’ s cruel , that ’s football			0
‘ a couple of the players spoke to me and i was n’t aware [ of him ] , because i don ’ t really look at the opposition like that			0
but that was the aim			0
’ @entity53 was at least not at fault for the third goal , which came from the other flank when @entity25 tricked his way through a couple of players before passing to @entity85 to net for @entity1 for the very first time			1
@entity51 ( left ) was in great form to provide two assists for @entity1 on saturday afternoon @entity10 ’s @entity89 scored a goal - of - the - season contender with a 40 - yard drive in the final 10 minutes , but it was too late and defeat left them four points adrift of safety			1
manager @entity97 laid part of the blame on his players , saying : ‘ they have realised there are only a certain amount of things you can do in preparation but you have to transfer it in the game			0
‘ sometimes i go and watch games and do n’t get in until 2am			0
sometimes i wake up early and watch a dvd of the other teams			0
me doing extra hours is not going to make any difference to them			0
