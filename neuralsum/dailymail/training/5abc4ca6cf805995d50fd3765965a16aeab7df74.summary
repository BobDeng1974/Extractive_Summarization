@entity1 's @entity0 have put in place plans to embrace @entity3 with a lot more detail than previously shown by @entity7 sports in honouring the war dead			1
@entity9 and @entity10 meet at @entity11 on november 9 in the third regular - season @entity0 game there this autumn			1
and , in a partnership with the @entity17 , the uniforms and helmets of both teams will feature the poppy logo , which will also be displayed to big effect on the pitch			1
@entity9 's @entity21 ( left ) and @entity23 's @entity22 will be wearing remembrance sunday - themed uniforms when the @entity26 and @entity27 meet in their regular season clash at @entity11 on november 9 an initiative in partnership with the @entity17 will see the poppy featured prominantly at @entity11 at the end of the match , 80,000 poppies will be dropped from the roof into the stands and all the kit and equipment will be auctioned , with the proceeds going to the @entity40 that supports the @entity17 ’s work with the @entity42			1
@entity43 , managing director of @entity0 @entity7 , said : ‘ the @entity0 has a tremendous respect and admiration for the service given by the military , both in the @entity1 and @entity7			1
’ @entity49 clubs now all wear poppies on their shirts in fixtures around @entity3 but only after a @entity54 campaign			1
@entity56 ’s football team were n’t going to have poppies on their kit when they played @entity58 on november 12 , 2011 , owing to a @entity60 edict but again @entity54 pressure resulted in @entity60 allowing poppies adorning black armbands			1
soldiers parade around @entity65 's @entity64 ground at half - time on @entity3 @entity68 ’s second autobiography , to be released on october 9 , is likely to create even more publicity than @entity71 ’s book , which comes out on the same day			1
the 43 - year - old has not given his employers at @entity74 or the @entity75 an advance view of the contents of @entity78 , written with award - winning author @entity79			1
@entity68 's second autobiography , written by @entity79 , come out the same day as @entity71 's @entity68 will have the platform of being on international duty with the @entity83 before the @entity85 qualifiers against @entity86 and @entity87			1
manager @entity88 said : ‘ we will just have to deal with it			0
’ @entity68 will surely have his say about former @entity93 manager sir @entity92 , who described him as an ‘ intimidating ferocious individual ’ in his recent memoirs			2
a sure sign of cycling ’s boom is the arrival on the scene of football agents			2
leading middleman @entity102 is the first to recognise the opportunities and now represents newcomer @entity104 , who turned to @entity102 to secure a dream move to @entity106			0
it was @entity102 who negotiated @entity104 ’s two - year , seven - figure contract with @entity106 cycling chief sir @entity110			2
the @entity111 is expected to be @entity113 ’s chief support rider next year			2
@entity111 rider @entity104 enlisted the expertise of @entity102 to secure his dream move to @entity106 @entity118 owner @entity117 ’s five - strong search committee to identify the next manager at @entity120 surprisingly includes fan @entity121 , a senior director at @entity122 , when @entity118 are in year two of a four - season kit contract with arch - rivals adidas			2
previous boss @entity125 was recommended by @entity120 ceo @entity126 but chosen by @entity117			0
bjorn in @entity129 frame @entity131 board members expect @entity132 and @entity127 to be sounded out about the @entity134 captaincy in 2016 as well as favourites @entity135 and @entity137			0
if @entity127 wants to be considered , it will complicate the selection process			0
the @entity143 , as chairman of the @entity142 tournament committee , was expected to be the fifth man on the nominations panel who would likely give a possible casting vote to @entity135			0
meanwhile , @entity135 ’s bid for the captaincy will not be helped by the upset caused when he withdrew from the 2014 race and publicly backed @entity151 rather than @entity152			2
it could cause complications if @entity127 ( pictured left drenching @entity58 's @entity155 , right , as they celebrate winning the @entity134 ) becomes a contender for the post of @entity142 captain for 2016 former @entity160 and @entity161 star @entity159 , player of the year at @entity162 in 1990 , has been declared bankrupt following a number of failed business ventures			0
these included a proposed upmarket quarterly magazine @entity166 that has gone into liquidation owing £ 216,000 to 44 creditors			0
@entity173 @entity172 chairman @entity171 ’s view of win bonuses is that players should return them if they lose			0
so instead of a cash incentive , the @entity172 team receive two extra shirts for a victory - much to the concern of the kitman			0
@entity172 owner @entity171 gives players extra shirts instead of win bonuses			0

the @entity0 will honour @entity3 at @entity11 on november 9
@entity9 and @entity10 meet in @entity188 for the third game this autumn
uniforms and helmets of both teams will feature the poppy logo
poppies will also feature on the pitch and 80,000 of them will drop from stands as part of an initiative in *conjunction* with the @entity17
@entity68 and @entity71 's autobiographies come out october 9
@entity68 's second book is likely to cause more *controversy* than @entity71 ’s
the @entity74 assistant 's book , @entity78 , is written by @entity79
