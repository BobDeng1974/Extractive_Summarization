by @entity0 cinema goers are used to looking out for warnings of nudity and violence in films			0
now another category has been added to the list of movie dangers – male chauvinism			0
cinemas in @entity11 have introduced an ‘ a ’ rating to highlight films that have a shortage of ‘ female perspectives ’			1
the guidance system – named the @entity18 test after @entity20 feminist @entity19 – will monitor whether at least two female characters talk to each other about subjects other than men			1
@entity25 fail : the @entity27 films have been deemed as sexist by the @entity18 test			0
pictured is @entity30 , as @entity31 , right , and @entity32 as princess @entity33 ‘ the entire @entity47 trilogy , all @entity27 movies , @entity41 , @entity42 and all but one of the @entity45 movies fail this test , ’ said @entity34 , the director of @entity35 , an art - house movie theatre in @entity39 's trendy @entity38 district			1
@entity35 is one of four @entity11 movie theatres that launched the new rating last month to draw attention to how few movies pass			1
most visitors have reacted positively to the initiative ‘ and for some people it has been an eye - opener , ’ said @entity34 , reclining in one of @entity35 's cushy red seats			0
beliefs about women 's roles in society are influenced by the fact that movie watchers rarely see ‘ a female superhero or a female professor or person who makes it through exciting challenges and masters them , ’ @entity34 said , noting that the rating does n't say anything about the quality of the film			1
‘ the goal is to see more female stories and perspectives on cinema screens			1
’ the state - funded @entity81 supports the initiative , which is starting to catch on			0
@entity84 cable tv channel @entity83 says it will start using the ratings in its film reviews and has scheduled an ‘ a ’ rated ‘ @entity92 ’ on nov. 17 , when it will show only films that pass the test , such as @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
the @entity18 test got its name from @entity20 cartoonist @entity19 , who introduced the concept in her comic strip @entity97 to watch out for in 1985			0
it has been discussed among feminists and film critics since then , but @entity34 hopes the ‘ a ’ rating system will help spread awareness among moviegoers about how women are portrayed in films			1
in @entity35 's wood - panelled lobby , students @entity106 and @entity108 acknowledged that most of their favourite films probably would n't get an ‘ a ’ rating			1
‘ i guess it does make sense , but to me it would not influence the way i watch films because i 'm not so aware about these questions , ’ said @entity112 , 29			0
one ratings test to rule them all : @entity47 trilogy has also been rated as sexist			1
pictured is actress @entity121 , who plays the @entity124 beauty @entity122 in the movie at least one @entity127 star sounded excited by the idea when asked about it by @entity129			0
‘ a feminist ratings system ? that 's so interesting ! ’ actress - producer @entity130 said in @entity131 , @entity132 , where she was attending a benefit dinner for gender equality			1
‘ i say , hey , let 's see if it works ! ’ the ‘ a ’ rating is the latest @entity11 move to promote gender equality by addressing how women are portrayed in the public sphere			1
@entity11 's advertising ombudsman watches out for sexism in that industry and reprimands companies seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes , for example by including skimpily clad women in their ads for no apparent reason other than to draw eyeballs			0
since 2010 , the @entity155 project has been trying to boost the number of women appearing as expert commentators in @entity11 media through a @entity161 page with 44,000 followers			0
the project has recently expanded to @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
for some , though , @entity11 's focus on gender equality has gone too far			0
‘ if they want different kind of movies they should produce some themselves and not just point fingers at other people , ’ said @entity168 , a physicist who writes a blog about @entity11 's ‘ gender madness			2
’ the ‘ a ’ rating also has been criticized as a blunt tool that does n't actually reveal whether a movie is gender - balanced			2
‘ there are far too many films that pass the @entity18 test that do n't help at all in making society more equal or better , and lots of films that do n't pass the test but are fantastic at those things , ’ said @entity11 film critic @entity181			2
@entity181 , who moved from communist @entity190 to @entity11 in the 1970s , also criticized the state - funded @entity81 - the biggest financier of @entity11 film - for vocally supporting the project , saying a state institution should not ‘ send out signals about what one should or should n't include in a movie			2
’ research in the @entity20 supports the notion that women are underrepresented on the screen and that little has changed in the past 60 years			0
of the @entity20 top 100 films in 2011 , women accounted for 33 per cent of all characters and only 11 per cent of the protagonists , according to a study by the @entity209 - based @entity208			2
another study , by the @entity210 at the @entity211 , showed the ratio of male to female characters in movies has remained at about two to one for at least six decades			1
that study , which examined 855 top box - office films from 1950 - 2006 , showed female characters were twice as likely to be seen in explicit sexual scenes as males , while male characters were more likely to be seen as violent			1
‘ apparently @entity127 thinks that films with male characters will do better at the box office			2
it is also the case that most of the aspects of movie - making - writing , production , direction , and so on - are dominated by men , and so it is not a surprise that the stories we see are those that tend to revolve around men , ’ @entity222 , the study 's lead author , said in an email			2
in 2010 , @entity240 became the first woman to win the @entity242 for @entity243			0
that movie - a war film about a bomb disposal team in @entity247 - does n't pass the @entity18 test			0

to get an ' a ' rating movies must have at least two female characters who talk to each other about something other than men
