@entity1 president @entity0 is ready to unleash a supersonic bomber towards @entity3 which can outrun the @entity6 ’s fastest fighter jets			1
the introduction of the @entity8 follows sorties by other @entity1 aircraft near @entity11 last month which disrupted commercial flights and sparked major security fears			1
on that occasion , @entity6 pilots flying @entity16 jets easily caught up with two propeller - driven @entity19 bombers and directed their crews away from @entity3 airspace			1
but the @entity8 ( @entity31 ) is three times faster than the @entity19 and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up @entity3 ’s @entity36 ( @entity36 ) squadrons , according to experts			1
the bomber , also known as the @entity40 because of its shape and huge wingspan , has just re-entered service in the @entity1 air force following a design overhaul			2
experts say it is now more than a match for any @entity3 aircraft , including the @entity16 , which is used to protect @entity3 airspace			2
like the @entity8 , the @entity16 can reach @entity51 – about 1,500mph			0
@entity1 president @entity0 ( pictured ) has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the @entity54 , according to experts but while the @entity1 aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling , the @entity16 ’s limit is 1,800 miles , meaning the @entity8 could maintain its maximum speed for much longer than its @entity3 counterpart without air - to - air refuelling			1
dr @entity63 , senior russian research fellow at the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) in @entity66 , said : ‘ the @entity31 now has greater thrust and fuel efficiency and it can carry a larger payload of conventional missiles			0
‘ the test flights were successful and the aircraft is now very potent			0
there is simply no @entity3 aircraft of its calibre or purpose			2
it is the largest bomber in the world			0
’ the first two revamped @entity79 passed a series of test flights last december and have now been passed for service			0
they are being prepared for possible action at air bases in @entity1 that are within easy striking distance of @entity3			1
one , @entity88 air base near @entity89 , northern @entity1 , is just 1,000 miles from the @entity90			2
ten more @entity79 will be modernised before 2020			0
dr @entity63 added that the @entity79 ’ revamp was part of a plan by president @entity0 to boost both @entity1 ’s arsenal of military hardware and its troop numbers			1
it comes at a time of heightened tension between @entity1 and the @entity54 , and while @entity3 ’s @entity102 are shrinking due to spending cuts			1
‘ president @entity0 has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the @entity54 , ’ said dr @entity63			1
‘ he has also improved his long - range nuclear missiles such as the @entity107 , which is now very hard to detect on launch			0
it is lighter and more compact , too , so more warheads can be fitted into a submarine			0
' he has also committed to the @entity114 low - visibility jet			0
this stealth jet could lead to potentially massive changes in the distribution of military power around the world			0
' he is doubling the number of his @entity122 troops , as well			0
’ an @entity124 aircraft from @entity125 shadows a @entity1 @entity127 aircraft ( file picture ) between now and 2020 , the size of the @entity131 ( @entity122 ) regiments will increase from 15,000 to 32,000			0
trained to the same level as @entity3 ’s @entity134 ( @entity134 ) , they were used in @entity135 and , most recently , in eastern @entity136 where they are understood to have organised a guerilla campaign by @entity1 separatists			1
experts also believe @entity0 could send the @entity131 to the @entity141 of @entity142 and @entity143 , both @entity145 members , to organise resistance among ethnic @entity1			1
dr @entity63 added : ‘ military activity in @entity149 and eastern @entity136 has borne all the hallmarks of the special @entity1 units – it would be a mistake to believe the same tactics might not be applied elsewhere			0
’ the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) has been following the @entity8 and @entity1 stealth - jet programmes			2
but while the @entity16 can not match the @entity8 ’s range , @entity6 sources insist it is a superior aircraft overall given its set of air - to - air weapons and its agility			1
an @entity155 spokesman said : ‘ the primary role of the @entity6 is to defend the @entity3			2
we are aware of recent @entity1 military activity			0
' @entity124 fighters will continue to routinely intercept , identify and escort @entity1 aircraft that travel through international airspace within the @entity3 ’s area of interest			1

@entity1 president @entity0 is about to unleash a new supersonic bomber
the @entity8 will be able to outrun the @entity6 **'s** fastest fighter jets
last month @entity1 @entity19 aircraft were *spotted* on sorties near @entity11
but @entity8 is three times faster than the @entity19 and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up @entity3 **'s** @entity36 squadrons
the @entity1 aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling
