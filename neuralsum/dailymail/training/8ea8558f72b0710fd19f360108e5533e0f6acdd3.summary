a new and potentially more accurate test for prostate cancer is being trialled across the @entity2			1
the new multi parametric ( mp ) mri scans could give accurate and detailed images making it easier to identify whether or not a patient has prostate cancer			1
the new scans could also predict the size of a tumour and how aggressive it is			0
the trial is testing whether the use of these advanced mri scans can detect the condition , without the need for painful and invasive biopsies			1
currently , men with suspected prostate cancer have a blood test to see if a higher level of protein - known as prostate - specific antigen ( @entity25 ) - is found			1
a new and potentially more accurate test for prostate cancer is being trialled across the @entity2			1
@entity29 ( mp ) mri scans can give accurate and detailed images making it easier to diagnose cancer , without a biopsy if the protein is found , they are referred on for a transrectal ultrasound ( @entity37 ) guided biopsy			1
this procedure involves using an ultrasound probe to guide a needle through the walls of the rectum and into the prostate gland to take samples to be analysed			0
it is performed under local anaesthetic			0
however , a spokesman for @entity49 , one of the centres trialling the new technique , said the current test is invasive but not always accurate			1
he said : ' as the ultrasound can not always reliably identify the disease , it can miss some cancers or lead to over-diagnosis , frequently resulting in unnecessary surgery			0
' however , the latest imaging technology , known as multi parametric ( mp ) @entity62 , can produce accurate and detailed scans that could make it easier to identify whether or not a patient has cancer and , if so , the specific size , position and aggressiveness of it			1
to protect against prostate cancer , take a lover - or 20			2
men who sleep with multiple women are almost a third less likely to develop the disease , according to @entity75 research published in october			0
researchers found men who have more than 20 notches on their bedpost slashed their risk of prostate cancer by 28 per cent			1
and the study also revealed that men who have slept with more than 20 women reduced their chances of getting the most aggressive tumours by 19 per cent			0
@entity88 , on the other hand , doubles the risk of the disease			0
' this could enable clinicians to either rule out the need for further testing or , if cancer is found , give a clearer understanding of which part of the prostate is affected			2
' at the moment , all men with raised @entity25 or an abnormal feeling prostate are advised to have a biopsy			2
but many will not have cancer			0
most will be suffering another condition which raises @entity25 levels in the blood , such as enlarged prostate			2
@entity108 , a consultant urological surgeon at @entity49 , said these biopsies miss some cancers , and falsely diagnose others , leading to unnecessary treatment			0
he said : ' these biopsies can miss cancers in some areas of the prostate which the needle can not reach , or pick up tiny traces of cancer that might be slow - growing and harmless			2
' this leads to men having unnecessary surgery to remove the prostate gland			0
' mr @entity108 is now working with colleagues at another nine sites across the country to recruit 700 men with suspected prostate cancer for the study by october 2015			1
he said : ' if , as we think , the study shows us that ( mp ) mri can accurately identify those who have cancer and those who do n't , it will truly revolutionise diagnosis for men with prostate cancer			1
' it will mean those with a negative scan will avoid undergoing potentially painful and invasive biopsies , while those with positive scans will benefit from their specialists having much greater detail of their cancer at the earliest possible stage			0
' prostate cancer , which mainly affects men over 50 , is the most common type of cancer in men with around 37,000 new cases diagnosed in the @entity2 every year			2
currently , prostate cancer is diagnosed with a painful and invasive biopsy which involves using an ultrasound probe to guide a needle through the walls of the rectum and into the prostate gland			1
here , cancerous cells are pictured under a microscope			0

new technique being trialled uses multi parametric ( mp ) mri scans
these could give accurate and detailed images to identify prostate cancer
could also ascertain the cancer *'s* size , location and aggressiveness
currently men undergo test to see if a higher level of protein @entity25 is found
they are then sent for an invasive biopsy involving a rectal needle
is n't 100 *%* accurate ; missing some cancers and falsely diagnosing others
