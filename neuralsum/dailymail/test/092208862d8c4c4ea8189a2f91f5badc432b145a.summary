@entity0 star @entity0 , who won the tv programme in 2006 , has revealed he is now homeless			1
the 33 year old from @entity3 's life went rapidly downhill after he finished first in the seventh series of the @entity6 show nine years ago			2
despite being given £ 100,000 of prize money and releasing a successful autobiography , @entity0 is now broke and living off the charity of friends			1
he believes that finding fame on @entity19 kick started a range of problems that led to a dependency on the @entity24 drug ketamine			1
he said : ' i had all of that money and i did n't know what to do with it – i put it on the wrong things			1
' the fame pushed me in a way that i did n't want to go			2
' @entity0 's entry picture for @entity0 @entity0 continued : ' i first got into drugs 15 years ago , i 've always been the last man standing at a party but then i became addicted to ketamine			1
' i could n’t go out without doing it			2
it became a habit and i did it every day			2
' i could n't go anywhere without getting given stuff			2
i do n’t want to know how much i spent on it			2
' it is an issue that has also affected many of his friends - in the last nine years since becoming famous , seven of his friends have died from drug - related incidents			2
@entity0 's drug addiction was n't his only problem though - he believes that his appearance on the reality show meant that he found it impossible to get a job or being taken seriously for his music after he left the house			1
he said : ' the work dried up pretty fast			2
no one would touch me with a barge pole because i was on @entity0			1
' when i left the house i was led down the garden path with a lot of things			0
' i felt like i was not being allowed to do what i wanted - i was a puppet			0
' @entity0 leaves the big brother @entity68 as the winner during the final of big brother seven on august 18 , 2006 although @entity0 has had a tumultuous time since leaving the house , one area where he has made great strides is overcoming his @entity77			1
the star claims that when he was younger , he had one of the worst cases of the condition in @entity82			2
on the show , he would involuntarily hit his throat , twitch and shout out swear words , particularly the word ' w * * * * * s '			0
but during his appearance on @entity12 , @entity0 's behaviour was far more controlled			1
although he had the occasional twitch and still appeared quite hyperactive , he held back from shouting out any unplanned words			0
unfortunately , as well as he battle with drugs , @entity0 's personal life and career prospects have also been marred with difficulty over the last nine years			1
a week before he left the @entity19 house in august 2006 , @entity0 started an ill - fate relationship with fellow contestant @entity98 but it quickly fizzled out			1
a month later @entity98 revealed that @entity0 had called time on the romance			1
@entity98 and @entity0 arrive for the @entity101 in 2006			1
the couple started a relationship after leaving the @entity19 house pete at a signing of his book in november 2006 @entity0 then started dating one of his good friends , @entity106 , better known as @entity108 , who he 'd had a secret crush on for three years			1
the pair continued to date for eight years before marrying in a fake ceremony at @entity112 in 2011 , before sealing the deal with an official ceremony on the reality show @entity115 in early 2014			0
but last september he revealed in a @entity117 post that they were getting divorced after just six months of marriage			0
after years of running from his problems by getting high on drugs , @entity0 finally decided to seek proper help by getting in contact with a drugs counselor a few years ago			1
he said : ' you do n't know you 're out of control until it suddenly hits you			0
' when i went to get proper help for my addiction , this drug worker started to ask me about loss and i talked to him about all of the friends i ’d had who died			0
' i had n’t been dealing with it			0
i was dealing with it by taking @entity138 and not dealing with it			0
' i had to deal with my friends deaths and that 's what got me off the @entity138			0
' pete at the opening night of @entity112 last year since getting clean , @entity0 admits that he has relapsed but states that he is now back on track			1
he said : ' i took @entity138 again and i relapsed but i hated it , i did n’t like being disassociated			0
' i like being here now and being able to chat to people			0
i 'm living my life now the best i can			0
' i 'm not @entity0 anymore , i ’m just @entity0			1
' the star is now trying to get his life back together and is attempting to make his name as an actor			1
he said : ' i do wish i 'd done things differently but i 've got a plan			0
' i ’ve got into acting , i 'm doing loads of films and working my way up the ladder			0
' my @entity77 ’s has calmed down so i thought , why not give it a chance			0
we have to start somewhere			0
' i 've got my eye on @entity163			0
