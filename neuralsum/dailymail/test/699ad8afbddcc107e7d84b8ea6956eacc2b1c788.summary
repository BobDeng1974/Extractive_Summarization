note to all managers : if you ’re top striker is misfiring , have a word with @entity4			1
he obviously knows the secret of getting them back among the goals			2
@entity4 , albeit for a short period of time , revived @entity14 ’s flagging @entity13 career last season ; now he ’s replicating the achievement with @entity16			1
@entity16 heads @entity17 into the lead against @entity13 in the 35th minute of the game @entity16 celebrates the goal that gave @entity4 's team the advantage at the end of the first half @entity16 continued his fine form for @entity17 from tuesday , where he scored a hat - trick in the 3 - 3 draw with @entity28 @entity16 ( second left ) is mobbed by his @entity17 team - mates after scoring the opening goal against @entity13 @entity16 points to the sky as he led the @entity17 attack against @entity13 in the @entity33 his success in rejuvenating @entity16 , who has scored six goals in eight games , will be viewed as , perhaps , @entity4 ’s most vital contribution if @entity17 win their @entity33 survival battle			1
‘ it ’s about strikers applying themselves , ’ said the @entity17 boss , fresh from his side ’s victory over former club @entity13			1
‘ like @entity44 , when i gave @entity44 an opportunity to come back into the group at @entity13 , he had to earn the right and he did that by the way he trained			1

man of the match : @entity16			2
stat : since @entity4 took over at @entity17 striker @entity92 is the @entity33 ’s top goalscorer			1
‘ i think @entity49 was on the back of being dropped i think when arrived			0
‘ i ’ve had chats with him , told him what i think of him and how everyone in @entity99 seemed to want him a year ago , and that does n’t just vanish			0
‘ so let ’s get him back firing , let ’s get him back training properly , and scoring goals			2
’ indeed , similar patterns are emerging from @entity108 ’s spell as manager at @entity110 last season and his current job in the @entity113			0
in addition to turning @entity14 and @entity16 back into @entity33 forces he ’s brought his fearless approach to blooding youth players with him to @entity119			1
where would the careers of @entity13 pair @entity63 and @entity57 be without @entity4 ’s guidance last season ? and we saw further evidence of the manager ’s youth - minded attitude as he handed @entity127 , 19 , only his second @entity17 start at a @entity110 on saturday			1
not only that but playing the teenager in the influential no 10 role			0
@entity17 manager @entity4 was visibly ecstatic at recording the win and getting three points upon the final whistle @entity4 said : ‘ we ’ve got good young players coming through at @entity17			1
@entity127 has been given his senior debut and @entity136 [ @entity137 ] , 16 years of age , is another			2
‘ @entity127 played in a position where you need maturity but i do n’t think he ’s fazed			2
‘ if i thought he was going to be a gamble i would n’t have done it , but @entity127 ’s got real ability , you can see that			2
@entity4 handed 19 - year - old @entity127 ( left ) only his second @entity17 start at a @entity110 on saturday ‘ he ’s got a big future at this football club			1
he ’s certainly at the right place			0
‘ so if you ’re a young kid coming through , you ’re not going anywhere else			0
you go to @entity13 or come to @entity17			1
‘ they ’re the two massive football clubs but you ’ve got two managers who are going to give them an opportunity			0
’ @entity17 ’s win virtually ended @entity13 chances of qualifying for the @entity158			1
@entity14 ( left ) was rejuvenated in front of goal following the arrival of @entity4 last season and when asked whether he ’d want another campaign of playing in the @entity165 manager @entity163 provided an uncommitted answer			1
‘ how would we deal with the @entity165 again ? it ’s difficult			0
it has been a very long season			0
when you do a whole season playing thursday - sunday maybe you arrive at the end at very difficult level , ’ said the @entity167			0
‘ it ’s not easy playing in the @entity165			0
when you are a young squad and you make the biggest effort during the season maybe you arrive , not physically , but mentally in a very difficult moment at the end of the season			0

@entity16 has scored six goals in eight games
@entity14 *thrived* under @entity4 at @entity13 last term
@entity4 handed @entity127 only his second @entity17 start on saturday
