in one of those @entity3 scenarios , @entity0 would awake on monday morning as the newest @entity5 hero			1
he would survey the empty champagne bottles , the booty of a rollicking night before , while his mobile telephone beeped urgently with missed messages			2
every media outlet would want him , and every available parking space in his street would be occupied by outside broadcast vehicles			2
his head would be hurting , as much from his hangover as the whack he received in the first half			0
the bandaging would still be on , but askew , and as he opened the door to fetch in the milk , a barrage of flashbulbs would explode before his furiously blinking eyes			0
video : scroll down for @entity26 's @entity25 : @entity28 0 - 2 @entity27 @entity29 netted a superb volley as @entity27 beat @entity28 2 - 0 in the @entity5 third round on sunday @entity29 's strike flew past the outstretched @entity33 in front of the travelling @entity27 faithful the @entity36 celebrates scoring at @entity37 as @entity27 advanced to the fourth round @entity0 reacts after missing a fine chance to put @entity40 in front during the second half of the @entity5 game @entity29 and his @entity27 team - mates went rushing to celebrate with the fans after he scored his fine goal @entity28 : steer 6 ; @entity47 6.5 , @entity48 7 , @entity49 7 , @entity50 6.5 ; @entity51 ( @entity52 68 , 6 ) , @entity53 7 ( c ) , @entity54 7 ( @entity55 88 ) , @entity56 6.5 ( @entity57 88 ) ; @entity58 7 ; @entity0 7 subs not used : @entity60 ( gk ) ; @entity47 , @entity61 , @entity47 booked : @entity49 @entity62 united : @entity63 5.5 , @entity64 5 , @entity65 5 , @entity66 5 , @entity67 4 ( @entity68 , 7 ) ; @entity69 6 , @entity29 6.5 ; @entity70 ( c ) 6 , @entity71 6 ( @entity72 ht , 6 ) , @entity73 5.5 ; @entity74 5 ( @entity75 59 , 6.5 ) subs not used : @entity77 ( gk ) , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 scorers : @entity29 64 ; @entity82 89 booked : @entity29 referee : @entity84 attendance : 9,264 player ratings by @entity87 at @entity37 here he is , the man who dumped @entity27 out of the @entity5 ; the striker who stunned the wealthiest club in the land			1
the bandaged bandito , the fastest gun in the west			0
late of @entity96 , now the talk of @entity28 - and many points beyond			2
for , back in the real world , it does n't happen like that			0
in the 55th minute , when @entity54 's cross falls to @entity0 in front of @entity27 's goal , he does not finish like a @entity106 or @entity107			1
he panics , he snatches at it , he scuffs his shot			0
the ball rolls harmlessly to goalkeeper @entity111 , with all the venom of a back - pass			0
@entity0 is 22 and has only recently returned from injury			1
he is a tireless worker , but not the most clinical presence in the penalty box			0
' he gave it a go , ' said his manager @entity119 , sympathetically			0
' there was nothing more to give			0
' and so the best team win			0
not the best team on the day , necessarily , because @entity40 's battling qualities should not be underestimated , and the scoreline flatters @entity27 a little ; but the best team , because @entity27 were the only ones that looked like scoring and when @entity0 missed that chance the occasion assumed an air of inevitability			1
the players that @entity133 has assembled were bound to break through sooner or later			1
sooner , as it transpired			0
just nine minutes after @entity0 's fluff , @entity29 provided a lesson in the taking of opportunities			1
of course that is the difference between shopping for players with a budget of £ 30,000 at @entity144 - as @entity119 did when buying @entity0 - and purchasing one of the finest young midfield players in @entity147 for £ 29million from @entity148			1
@entity70 played the ball square to @entity69 and his pass to @entity29 was cut out by the extraordinarily hard - working @entity58 , the pick of @entity40 's tenacious midfield			1
unfortunately , this intervention only succeeded in teeing the ball up for @entity29			1
it sat nicely before him and he struck a first - time shot that dipped and flew into the top corner , leaving goalkeeper @entity33 with no chance			2
it is testament to @entity40 that , despite this setback , and the overwhelming odds , they refused to lie down			1
@entity163 celebrates after securing @entity27 's victory with a late chipped effort in the last minute @entity75 cleverly chips the ball over @entity33 after being sent through on goal in the last minute @entity0 scuffed his effort into the floor when he only had @entity111 in the @entity27 goal to beat @entity119 ducks down to greet opposing manager @entity133 in the dugout at @entity37 @entity65 and @entity0 clashed heads in the 20th minute which resulted in a stoppage in play @entity65 had to get his head @entity177 on the pitch after the incident but carried on playing @entity0 and @entity65 sport bandages during the @entity5 third round ficture following a sickening clash of heads in the 72nd minute , a header from captain @entity53 — a @entity27 fan , he got @entity70 ’s shirt at the end — needed to be cleared from the line by @entity163			1
that name alone shows what @entity40 were up against			1
@entity75 did not start the game , but came on as a second - half substitute for @entity74			0
@entity40 are bottom of @entity194			1
so it was one of those rare occasions : credit to all and everyone home happy			0
the locals know they had a fair and courageous swing at it , but did n’t expect to win anyway ; the travellers from @entity62 knew their millionaires had been in a game but rose to the challenge			0
@entity210 later said that @entity67 and @entity71 had suffered significant injuries early in the game , but soldiered on to half - time			0
of course , a 2 - 0 win at @entity40 is no less than is expected , but the @entity5 finds out the fainthearted soon enough — just look at @entity217 ’ result on sunday — and @entity27 treated @entity40 with the respect they , and the competition , deserved			1
from the first minute when @entity0 gave @entity223 a clump to see if he fancied the physical challenge — he did , although his kicking was poor — it was clear that @entity40 were up for the scrap			1
a brutal 21st - minute clash of heads ended with @entity0 and @entity65 patched up by bandages and staples , and in the first half @entity27 were never allowed to settle			1
their opportunities were greatly limited , a @entity70 shot after 15 minutes , one from @entity73 that required a save 17 minutes later			0
@entity235 is surrounded by @entity27 players as he makes his way into the opposing area on sunday @entity70 leads out @entity27 in front of a bumper crowd at @entity37 while @entity235 captains @entity40 one @entity40 fan tries to get his fellow supporters going as he stands above the crowd on his chair @entity66 clears the ball under pressure in the first - half with @entity70 giving instructions @entity249 attempts to hold off the challenge of @entity71 as @entity40 looked to attack @entity210 's side @entity27 had more control after half - time , but without creating a great number of chances			1
it was only when @entity40 pressed for an equaliser that @entity27 added emphasis to the scoreline with a second , scored by @entity75 on the break			1
@entity40 lobbed a free - kick into the area , it was cleared and @entity70 played a quite lovely pass out to the flank that @entity75 seized on breaking down the left			2
he drew steer and then lifted the ball over him perfectly			0
they wo n’t have seen too many finishes like that in @entity194 and for good reason : @entity75 ’s £ 60m transfer fee probably amounts to more than the total expenditure of every @entity194 club combined			2
@entity40 ’s total budget is £ 1m and that does n’t buy goals			2
this much was plainly obvious on sunday			0
they have scored on just five occasions in the league at @entity37 and while @entity27 ’s back line can be unconvincing they are still a considerable step up from the sort of defences that have held strong down here			2
in the 73rd minute , @entity53 fed @entity0 , but his shot deflected wide			2
it was n’t his day			0
as @entity119 spoke about the bravery of his players , his words were momentarily drowned out by sir @entity295 ’s helicopter taking off from a nearby field			0
there was to be no @entity299 story down in @entity40			2
this is the modern world			0
@entity28 supporters cheer their side on before kick - off with the @entity194 side looking to cause an upset @entity74 is put under pressure by @entity48 and @entity49 in the box as he tries to get a shot away we wanted @entity309 ! @entity40 fans pose with a flag suggesting they were n't quite happy with drawing the @entity313 giants a tv cameraman gets down to work above the scoreboard during the game at @entity37 sir @entity295 's helicopter prepares to land near @entity28 's stadium @entity37 former @entity27 boss @entity295 waves for the cameras after touching down in @entity40 @entity295 makes his way towards @entity37 to watch @entity27 take on @entity323 in the @entity5 @entity50 of @entity28 runs at @entity71 as the winger looked to make inroads during the first - half @entity27 captain @entity70 lines up to take a free - kick with the @entity37 packed to the rafters on sunday afternoon thousands of home fans greeted the @entity27 team coach as it arrived in @entity332 , with @entity74 involved in the starting xi @entity334 here to like our @entity27 facebook page .			1

@entity29 nets superb volley which helps @entity27 through to the fourth round of the @entity5
@entity163 comes off the bench to add second for @entity133 's side late on
@entity194 side @entity40 troubled @entity27 all afternoon , with @entity0 missing their best chance
@entity27 defender @entity65 has to be stapled on the pitch after a sickening clash of heads with @entity0
