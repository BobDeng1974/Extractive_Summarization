religious protests have been planned in opposition to @entity3 's first ever home sunday fixture against @entity5			1
the national side have played overseas on a sunday in the past , most recently in their opening @entity7 qualifier in @entity9 , but this weekend will break new ground in @entity11			1
the @entity12 has been careful in the past not to arrange sunday fixtures , and once had an article of association enshrining such a policy , but was powerless to act once @entity17 introduced its ' week of football ' blueprint for the current qualifying campaign			1
but that cuts no ice with critics , some of whom have called on the @entity12 to boycott the fixture			2
a general view of @entity28 during a @entity30 qualifier between @entity3 and @entity31 in 2009 the @entity32 is planning to hold a service at its @entity35 church , located just a few hundred yards from @entity28 , 75 minutes before the 5pm kick - off			1
the @entity38 , meanwhile , has issued a statement expressing its dismay at events			0
' this will be the first time an international football match has been held in @entity11 on a sunday , and it marks another watershed moment in modern @entity48 's increasing rejection of the @entity49 , ' it read			1
' far too many sporting and social events are now organised on sundays with , it seems , scant regard for the rights of evangelicals who , because of their faith , are unable to be involved			0
many evangelical protestants are ardent fans of the national team and would dearly love to be present at the match			0
' we fully accept that we are out of step with the majority of public opinion on this matter , and we suspect that many who claim to be @entity56 will be present at @entity28 on sunday			2
' @entity3 boss @entity66 , speaking earlier this week to the @entity65 , said : ' we appreciate and understand people 's religious beliefs - but the game must be played on sunday , as that date was decreed when the fixture was made by @entity17			1
@entity3 manager @entity66 gestures on the touchline at @entity73 on wednesday evening ' we hope for a victory on the night , and for the usual wonderful support from all @entity3 fans			1
' there was a conciliatory message from @entity79 , chairman of the @entity81 ' clubs			0
@entity79 told @entity82 : ' we understand there will be a protest near the stadium and that is their right			2
i imagine it will be very peaceful and they are fully entitled to do that			0
' but this is not an @entity12 decision and i do n't think suggestions that the game is forfeited are realistic at all			0
' it is clearly a matter of choice			0
some fans have made the decision not to attend for sincerely held beliefs and no doubt they are passionate as any other fans			0
' i fully respect those who oppose it but it must be , and it will be , played			2

@entity3 take on @entity5 in a @entity7 qualifier on sunday
it is the first time @entity3 have played on a sunday at home
religious protests are planned near the stadium in opposition
