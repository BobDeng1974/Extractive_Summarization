by @entity1 reporter published : 11:02 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 01:16 est , 5 october 2012 the latest victim of what health officials are calling a ' rapidly evolving outbreak ' of rare fungal meningitis was a dedicated child care worker who spent 20 years tending to a husband suffering from @entity9 's disease			1
@entity10 died on wednesday afternoon at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , surrounded by family members			1
mrs @entity10 , 56 , is one of thousands of patients recently treated in @entity13 hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical treatment			1
but since then a tainted batch of steroids released across the @entity21 has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis			1
mrs @entity10 , of @entity40 , @entity13 , was the fifth person to succumb to the infection			1
a blog written by a close friend of @entity45 's family , @entity44 , characterized her as ' hilarious , beautiful , and full of life ' and praised her for carrying for husband @entity45 after he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as @entity9 's disease - almost 20 years ago			2
' over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next , ' wrote			0
' her brain could n't take the stress			0
after a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care			0
@entity45 , one of the longest surviving patients with @entity61 , there by her side			0
' @entity45 served on the board of her husband 's namesake child care organization , the @entity68			0

the company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection			1
it is not clear how many patients received tainted injections , or even whether everyone who got one will get sick			0
so far , 35 people in six states - @entity13 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 - have contracted fungal meningitis , and five have died , according to the @entity96			1
in an alarming indication that the outbreak could get a lot bigger , @entity77 health officials said the pharmacy involved , the @entity75 of @entity76 , has recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single - dose vials of the steroid , preservative - free methylprednisolone acetate			1
no solicitors : specialized pharmacy @entity75 has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections an unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between july and september , federal health officials said			2
several hundred of the vials , maybe more , have been returned unused , one @entity77 official said			1
however many other vials were used			0
at one clinic in @entity125 , @entity93 , more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots , officials said			1
at two clinics in @entity13 , more than 900 patients received them			2
the incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days , and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials , who are now calling this a national health crisis			0
@entity13 : the initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases , two of whom are in critical condition			2
three others have already died			0
@entity92 : the second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic			2

@entity89 : one person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated			1
@entity90 : seven medical clinics in @entity90 pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported			1
unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis , fungal meningitis is not contagious			1
it is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord			0
symptoms include a severe headache , nausea , fever , and dizziness			0
the first patients identified in @entity13 experienced slurred speech , and difficulty walking and urinating			2
the pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid @entity170 on september 26 according to the @entity172			2
the drug is primarily used to relieve back pain			1
the drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s			0
@entity13 's @entity178 , ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of wednesday with two in critical condition , reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered			1
' some are doing well and improving			0
some are very ill - very , very seriously ill and may die , ' @entity13 health official dr. @entity187 said			1
in @entity13 alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid			1
the link between the injections and the meningitis was discovered by @entity13 physician @entity194 , who found the initial cases were all people who 'd recently received an epidural			1
critical condition : @entity13 health official dr. @entity187 says the infected are ' very , very seriously ill and may die ' officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis			1
@entity75 released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to discover what happened			0
but company president and licensed pharmacist @entity206 has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company web site is down			2
an archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every @entity21 state			2
@entity75 is among the approximately 3,000 @entity21 compounding pharmacies specializing in blending , liquefying , or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets , require specific dosages , or who have allergies			0
such companies are regulated by the state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with			0
ground zero : the first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at @entity11 which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock the pharmacy has produced questionable products before			1
in 2006 , @entity75 was one of four companies ordered by the the @entity172 to cease producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause ' grave reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats			0
' the cream was the cause of two deaths , neither tied directly to @entity75			0
that same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices			2
they were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment , misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use , and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose			0
an @entity172 warning letter admonished the company that it was ' distributing an unapproved drug in violation ' of federal regulations			0
in 2010 the company was sued by an @entity268 firm that alleged @entity75 illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act			0
