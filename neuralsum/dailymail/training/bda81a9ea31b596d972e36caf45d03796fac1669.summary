the outspoken anchor ended his overnight election coverage by ignoring the desperate human cost of last weeks storm and insensitively hail it as a game changer that allowed president @entity12 to secure his second term			1
using his final thoughts of the election evening to declare that he was ' so glad ' the fatal storm storm smashed into the @entity18 of the @entity19 , @entity4 ' comments were greeted with outrage by @entity21 and independents on @entity23			1
scroll down for @entity24 @entity4 the outspoken and forthright host of @entity5 ' @entity26 ' caused outrage during @entity28 coverage by saying he was ' so glad ' superstorm @entity30 aided president @entity12 's re-election ' what kind of sicko says they 're so happy we had that hurricane last week ? seriously @entity4 is beyond revolting , ' tweeted ' @entity37 '			1
others were more level headed in their criticism , with @entity41 taking to the social networking site to say that , ' no amount of political points are worth even one life lost			0
' another @entity23 user called ' @entity47 ' called @entity4 ' a disgusting excuse for a person ' , while ' @entity50 ' said that he was ' a disgrace to humanity			2
' even last night in the @entity5 studio , where he was on a panel including @entity56 , @entity4 ' comments caused an audible ' oooo ' , leading him to raise his hand to explain			1
@entity23 was awash with outrage from members of the public upset with @entity4 comments regarding superstorm @entity30 the @entity5 host claimed that he was happy that @entity30 had occurred because it gave president @entity12 a much needed boost in the polls the 66 - year - old news anchor clarified his comments on air as politically speaking - but the damage was already done ' no , politically i should say - not in terms of hurting people , ' explained a backtracking @entity4			1
' the storm brought in possibilities for good politics			2
' despite hailing the storm - of - a - lifetime for aiding the re-election of president @entity12 at the expense of @entity81 , the at times controversial @entity5 host took to @entity23 where he clarified his statement			1
' to clarify -- i was thrilled at the cooperation between the president and state officials that made the country proud			2
great bipartisanship , ' he tweeted			0
' obviously i was n't talking about the horror of the storm			0
i grew up on the @entity93 , ' @entity4 wrote on his @entity23 feed			2
commander in chief : president @entity12 ( left ) hugs marine owner @entity97 ( right ) during a tour of @entity99 , @entity100 , which was badly affected by @entity30 devastation : waves break in front of a destroyed amusement park wrecked by @entity105 , @entity100 aerial view : @entity105 , @entity100 , was surrounded by water after @entity30 lashed the @entity18 the death toll from @entity30 has already exceeded 100 and many who were in the path of the storm in @entity100 and @entity112 lost their property and were forced into emergency shelter - which some are still relying on			1
the massive weather system also caused mayhem on @entity28 , with many voting districts and precincts facing power outages , fuel shortages and some had to light up their polling places with flares in the dark			0
indeed , findings from the @entity127 's election weekend survey in the aftermath of the storm said that president @entity12 held a 48 - percent to 45 - percent lead over @entity81 among those likely to vote			1
this was compared to a week before the storm which had each candidate level on 47 percent of the likely vote			2
the respected center polled 2,709 likely voters from october 31st to november 3rd in their final pre-election survey while the previous survey dated from october 24th to 28th			0
non-partisan pals : @entity141 , known to be a longtime critic of @entity12 , put those differences aside on when he guided the president on a tour of damaged areas of @entity100 up in the air : the @entity149 helicopter , carrying president @entity12 and @entity100 governor @entity141 , took an aerial tour of the @entity18 in @entity100 destroyed : homes were wrecked by flooding from @entity30 , pictured on in @entity153 , @entity100 in fact according to @entity127 , 69 - percent of all likely voters approved of the way president @entity12 handled the storm 's impact and 46 percent of @entity81 's supporters did too			1
more importantly for president @entity12 , 63 percent of swing voters looked favourably on his handling of the storm and its effects			1
analysts said that the storm boosted @entity12 's image among voters by visibly allowing him to show a bipartisan side			1
his rapprochement with @entity100 governor @entity141 and the manner in which he was publicly thanked by one of his fiercest critics was seen as damaging to @entity81			0
this was especially the case as @entity141 had been the keynote speaker at the @entity175 and had been one of @entity81 's most vocal supporters			0
praise from @entity4 : @entity175 presidential candidate and former @entity180 gov. @entity81 gives his concession speech in @entity182 last night but , even before his massively controversial comments last night , @entity4 had been ruffling feathers with his forthright political opinions during early @entity28 coverage			1
one of his first targets were @entity19 who do not vote - describing them as idiots , before attacking those who vote for third party candidates			0
' if you have n't voted , i do n't want to talk to you , ' said @entity4 earlier in his broadcast			2
' and if you vote for one of these numbskull third or fourth party candidates like @entity196 or @entity197 and then you go ' oh , i was surprised by what happened , ' well , you should n't be			0
' because idiots like you voted for a third or fourth party candidate and they do n't know how how the system works : two choices			0
' president @entity12 speaks at his election night party last night in @entity205 indeed , @entity4 capped off a memorable evening for himself by praising @entity81 's concession speech instead of attacking president @entity12 's victory one			1
' i mean , i thought @entity81 ’s speech last night was a piece of wonder , ' said @entity4			2
' i thought the way he came out alone and stood in one , as they say on @entity214 , right out there by himself — not with the wife , with the shoulder to cry on or any of that — stood out there with manliness and grace , and did absolutely everything right			0
‘ ' i called the president			0
’ this is out of the book			0
this is how you do it ; it ’s biblical			0
and every single thing was classic , perfect			0

' i *'m* so glad we had that storm last week , ' said @entity5 's @entity4 last night - claiming the storm helped president @entity12 gain re-election
