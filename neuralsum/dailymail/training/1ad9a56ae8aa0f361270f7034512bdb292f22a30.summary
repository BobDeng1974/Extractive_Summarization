he sits flanked by armed extremists , a baby - faced islamic state suspect who has been dubbed the ‘ white jihadi ’			1
the meek - looking young man in a t - shirt appeared in a photo on @entity7 yesterday holding an assault rifle in front of the @entity11 flag of @entity12			1
last night counter-terrorism experts were trying to identify the fighter , amid speculation that the photo could be a sophisticated fake			2
in a further twist , the image also seems to have first appeared online around the start of december			2
the picture was tweeted by @entity36 on december 2 with the message : ' @entity39 soldier in their rank of " @entity42 and well trained " soldiers			0
but if genuine , the recruitment of a young , white man could be viewed as a major coup for the terrorist group			2
@entity48 , of counter-extremism think - tank @entity49 , said the group was examining the image ’s authenticity			1
‘ i have not come across this picture before , ’ he said			2
‘ it is also strange that one post has called him “ @entity31 ” rather than him taking on an @entity59 name			0
but having said that , i am not going to discount it			0
’ @entity63 's death was announced on social media he added that @entity12 had access to ‘ very sophisticated ’ editing software used by @entity68 special effects experts			1
comments left by @entity7 users suggest it has been doctored			1
another source said there were no known white converts in @entity75 and the photo had not been shared and ‘ celebrated ’ by @entity12			1
‘ if he ’s happy to sit there with his face uncovered , we ’d have seen it in a bigger propaganda hit , ’ said the source			2
most fighters who have travelled to join extremists in @entity75 and @entity86 are of @entity88 or @entity89 heritage , with around 60 @entity26 and about 500 @entity25			1
but @entity90 , @entity91 mp for @entity92 , has suggested the figure for @entity25 was a fourfold underestimate			2

@entity98 said nobody with the name @entity31 had been reported missing			0
the @entity101 said it did not comment on individual cases			0
it said : ' the @entity25 advises against all travel to @entity75 and parts of @entity86			2
anyone who does travel to these areas , even for humanitarian reasons , is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm			0
' it follows news that a jihadist calling himself @entity114 became the 35th @entity115 to have been killed while fighting for @entity22 in @entity75 this week			0
he was pictured smiling as he posed with an @entity117 assault rifle outside a sports shop			1
in the image the militant is seen wearing camouflage gear as he proudly brandishes the weapon on a shopping street			0
he is understood to have been killed alongside two @entity125 jihadis during fierce clashes in the @entity75 desert town of @entity128			0
@entity129 : @entity130 , 19 , had been fighting for @entity131 in the besieged @entity75 town of @entity133 when he suffered serious wounds from a @entity136 air strike he is just the latest in a steady flow of @entity25 militants to be killed fighting for @entity22 in the @entity139 - a figure that has grown dramatically towards the end of the year as @entity136 - led airstrikes target the group 's strongholds and @entity146 and @entity147 forces retake land from the terrorists			1
today it was revealed that @entity136 - led air strikes in @entity75 and @entity86 have killed more than 1,000 jihadis in the past three months , nearly all of them from the @entity131			0
' at least 1,171 have been killed in the @entity155 and international air strikes [ since september 23 ] , including 1,119 jihadists of the @entity131 group and @entity158 , ' said the @entity159 , which relies on a network of activists and medics across the war - ravaged country for its information			0
among the dead were 1,046 members of @entity12 , which has seized large chunks of @entity86 and @entity75 and is the main target of the air campaign			0
seventy - two of those killed were members of @entity175 's branch in @entity75 , the @entity158 , while another was a jihadist prisoner whose affiliation was unknown , an @entity159 statement said			0
the remaining 52 were civilians			0
@entity63 's death was announced on social media by a fighter of @entity183 origin who goes by the @entity184 and who claims to have trained alongside the militant in @entity75			0
he said the @entity115 was killed in @entity128 alongside two militants of @entity125 origin named @entity189 & @entity190			0
@entity22 supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be @entity197 - raised brothers @entity195 and @entity198 , who joined @entity22 in august having only recently converted to @entity59			2
details of @entity63 's true identity are not known and reports of his death could not be independently verified			0
the @entity203 said it was aware of reports of the death of a @entity25 national , but could not confirm their legitimacy due to the lack of consular presence in @entity75			2
he is just the latest in a long line of @entity25 killed fighting for @entity22 in @entity75 and @entity86 in recent months - many of them having travelled to join the group after its declaration of a so - called caliphate in the vast swaths of territory it controls , and @entity220 's self - appointment as a caliph			1
the number of @entity25 deaths has risen dramatically towards the end of the year , as the fighter 's naive expectations of @entity228 - style warfare are replaced by the brutal reality of fierce battles with the group 's enemies : @entity175 - affiliated @entity158 , the @entity233 , @entity75 and @entity86 regime armies , @entity235 tribes , @entity237 militias , and a number of other rebel groups in the area			1
sick : former supervisor at @entity243 , 25 - year - old @entity241 ( left ) , was one of four @entity245 jihadis killed fighting in @entity75			0
in november @entity246 ( right ) , a 30 - year - old father of three from @entity247 , blew himself up in @entity86 killing eight people and injuring 15 others their fight is made even harder by near constant airstrikes from warplanes sent by the @entity136 and its @entity155 allies in @entity75 ; and from @entity136 , @entity255 , @entity125 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity26 and of course @entity25 itself in neighbouring @entity86			1
the greatest number of @entity25 killed fighting for @entity22 , however , have been killed in street battles with @entity146 and @entity147 troops , who have been making huge gains in northern @entity75 and western @entity86 since september , having lost vast swaths of territory to @entity22 earlier in the year			1
in recent weeks there have been a number of reports of @entity25 militants expressing their desire to return to @entity25 having grown disillusioned with the reality of fighting for @entity22			1
professor @entity271 from @entity273 's @entity272 for the @entity274 says he was contacted by a man representing a group of up to 30 @entity25 militants , all of whom wanted to return to the @entity25 but were worried about being arrested on their return			1
he believes as many as a fifth of @entity25 fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation and claimed less - hardened jihadists could be used to show would - be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by @entity22 propaganda .			1
