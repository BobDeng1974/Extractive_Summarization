daredevil photographer @entity7 was given access to the spire to create a 360 degree panorama of the view - but instead had to deal with a huge storm			1
' mission aborted - there 's a storm coming in so we ca n't shoot , ' he tells the camera in a @entity19 video of the storm			2
scroll down to see the sandstorm video and the amazing 360 panoramic image the moment the storms are spotted : sandstorms seen from the top of the @entity25 , 628m above @entity3 clouds engulf @entity3 as a huge sandstorm engulfs the area around the @entity6 photographer @entity7 at the top of the @entity6 , with the lighting conducting rod behind him the video shows clouds rolling in from the sea , while mr @entity7 moves around the tiny spire for a better look			1
' it 's a long way down , and it 's very windy up here , ' he says			0
' there are low , slow clouds travelling quite fast now , flowing in from the sea - i 've never seen anything like that			0
' he is also seen showing off the lightning conducting spire			0
' this is the lightning conductor - so we 're maybe a little bit close to that - but there 's no lightning at the moment , ' he says , before clambering up onto the edge of the spire for a better view			2
' i 'll just stand up here for a better view - it 's a long way down			0
' eventually , even mr @entity7 admits it may be time to leave			0
' it 's extremely windy , we ca n't go on with this			0
' mr @entity7 then abandons the spire , to return later to complete his creation of a panoramic view of @entity3			1
composed of over 70 individual photos , it recreates the view @entity69 made famous as he sat at the tower ’s peak during the filming of @entity73 , ‘ @entity74 ’			1
navigate around the interactive image below ( may not work on all mobile devices ) the top of the @entity6 , developed by global property developer @entity78 , is over 200 metres above the highest point reached by the building ’s elevators , which reach the 160th floor at speeds of some 10 metres per second			1
the tower ’s public observation deck is on the 124th floor			0
the journey to the pinnacle involves a steep ladder climb within the 200 - meter spire that crowns the building			0
it takes in @entity3 ’s many landmarks , including the iconic @entity95 , the world ’s biggest mall , the @entity98 and the @entity99 and shows the remarkable growth of a city still on a fast track to developing as a business hub and tourist destination			1
@entity3 based photographer @entity7 created the shot using a mechanised panoramic tripod head to take a series of 48 panoramic images , each shot at a resolution of 80 megapixels			2
mr @entity7 was given access to the top of the @entity6 , developed by global property developer @entity78			2
it is over 200 metres above the highest point reached by the building ’s elevators , which reach the 160th floor at speeds of some 10 metres per second			0
the tower ’s celebrated public observation deck , at the top , @entity6 is on the 124th floor			1
the journey to the pinnacle involves a steep ladder climb within the 200 - meter spire that crowns the building			0
these were then stitched together with manually shot images to ‘ fill - in ’ gaps caused by equipment installed at the top of the tower such as the lightning conductor and aircraft beacons			0
the result is an image that can be zoomed , tilted and rotated , giving viewers a sense of how it must feel to sit on top the world ’s highest building			2
one of the astonishing 360 images from the top of the 828 metre high @entity6 in @entity3 the image has been released to celebrate the second @entity144 ( @entity145 ) , which will take place in @entity3 in march			1

' this is an extraordinary image taken from an extraordinary location , ' said his excellency @entity156 , the general secretary of the award			0
' it reflects the goals of @entity145 , to extend the boundaries of photography and celebrate images of unusual beauty and quality that are truly outstanding , ' photographer @entity7 climbing to the top of the tower to set up his equipment @entity3 based photographer @entity7 said he has wanted to take the photographs for several years			1
' i 've always wanted to – ever since seeing the first designs of the building , ' he told @entity173			0
' the @entity6 is a perfect building for shooting a 360 degree pano from the top of , because its ' roof ' is only 1.5 meters across			1
' this means that you can shoot from a single location and capture the entire view , without the building itself getting in the way ( aircraft beacons and lightning conductors excluded ! )			0
' i shot a 45 gigapixel panorama of the @entity3 skyline in april 2010 – at the time , the world ’s largest ever digital panorama , and thought that a panorama from the pinnacle of the @entity6 would be a great way to top that			1
' as long as it was big enough to make it interesting to zoom around in , it did n’t need to be 10 ’s or 100 ’s of gigapixels			0
' it ’s all about the view			2
nothing can top that view – it is a unique place			2
' since the time of the @entity205 , remarkably few buildings have held the title of ' @entity208 ’s tallest structure on land '			0
' the @entity6 is only the 15th in over 4,500 years of human history			2
' it ’s a very , very special building , and hopefully people will appreciate it even more now that they can see the view from the top			2
' it ’s all about being able to take people up there “ virtually ” and share what i experienced for real , and i hope people enjoy it ! ' @entity69 is one of the few to have see the incredible view from the top of the towers , when he performed a stunt for @entity74			1
