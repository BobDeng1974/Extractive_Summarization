by @entity1 reporter published : 23:52 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 23:53 est , 29 september 2013 @entity4 's day to argue his case has finally come			1
in a hearing room before arbitrator @entity9 , lawyers for the @entity7 third baseman will argue why the 211 - game suspension imposed by @entity11 on aug. 5 should be overturned			1
' obviously this is going to be a grueling process all the way through , ' mr @entity4 said			2
' this has been a burden			0
it 's been a big burden			0
so let 's get it on			0
' a three - time @entity20 , mr @entity4 is fourth on the career home run list with 654			1
the @entity22 says the penalty imposed by baseball commissioner @entity24 is excessive			0
unless there is a settlement , a decision is n't expected until the winter			0
strike three ? : @entity4 reacts after striking out in a recent game , he 'll be looking to his a home run in his arbitration hearings this week a veteran of baseball salary arbitration , the 64 - year - old mr @entity9 took over as the sport 's grievance arbitrator in june 2012 from @entity36 , fired a month earlier by management after almost 13 years			1
mr @entity36 had overturned a 50 - game suspension of @entity40 outfielder @entity39 in february after the players ' association argued the urine sample was not handled properly			2
in mr @entity9 's only decision thus far , he upheld a 100 - game suspension imposed last year on @entity47 reliever @entity46 for a second positive test			1
he has initially set aside monday through friday for the hearing , where each side can introduce evidence , present witnesses and cross-examine them			0
after the hearing days conclude , the sides will be given several weeks to submit final briefs			0
mr @entity9 will then take time to make his decision			0
while technically chairman of a three - person panel , mr @entity9 is the independent member joined by one representative of each side			0
defiant to the end : mr @entity4 blasted the @entity7 and @entity11 during a minor league rehab assignment in august , saying they were conspiring to keep him off the field mr @entity4 has four law firms working for him , with team @entity4 including @entity69 of @entity70 ( known for taking cases with a high media - profile ) ; @entity73 of @entity75 - based @entity74 ( who worked on @entity39 's case ) ; @entity78 , co-head of the @entity81 commercial litigation group at @entity82 ( a firm used by @entity4 pal @entity83 ) ; and @entity84 ( who represented @entity11 umpires in 1999 )			1
earlier this year , mr @entity4 retained and then terminated two other firms			2
yet , for all the outside legal help , much of the case will be presented by 55 - year - old @entity90 , a @entity91 graduate hired by the players ' association in 2008 from @entity94 , which represents employees in the hotel , gaming and food service industries			1
mr @entity90 was promoted to @entity22 general counsel in february , when union head @entity100 gave up that role a half - year after he made public he had been diagnosed with a brain tumor			1
worked his way back : despite all the forces working against him - age , rehabilitation after a second hip surgery , a looming ban - @entity4 worked his way back to the @entity109 after a successful @entity111 rehab @entity112 and @entity113 , @entity11 's top labor lawyers , will direct management 's case with assistance from @entity118 , a law firm that represents several @entity81 leagues			1
mr @entity4 was suspended for his involvement with the now - closed @entity122 clinic in @entity123 , @entity124 the 13 other players penalized accepted their suspensions , which included a 65 - game ban for mr @entity39 and 50 - game penalties for the others			2
@entity11 said mr @entity4 's was suspended under baseball 's joint drug agreement ' based on his use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance - enhancing substances , including testosterone and human growth hormone over the course of multiple years			1
' he also was disciplined under the collective bargaining agreement ' for attempting to cover up his violations of the program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the office of the commissioner 's investigation			0
' for only three years : the tarnished player admitted taking steroids from 2001 to 2003 during his time with the @entity151 , as seen here mr @entity4 is being treated as a first offender under the drug program , which means any suspension does n't start unless upheld by an arbitrator			1
following hip surgery in january and a leg injury sustained during a minor league rehabilitation assignment in july , mr @entity4 returned to the @entity7 on the day he was suspended			1
the 38 - year - old hit .244 with seven homers and 19 rbis in 44 games			1
' i 'm really looking forward to at least one full off season of hardcore training , ' said the oft - injured third baseman			2
' i have n't had that in quite a long time - then come back in tremendous shape and help this team win			2
this team has a lot of things to do over the winter			0
obviously my situation is going to play a big part in it			0
' where it all began : @entity4 's career started in @entity179 in 1996 , some have speculated his steroid use goes back even that far @entity4 and @entity181 squawked at each other in the summer , with mr @entity4 maintaining the @entity7 were trying to keep him from returning			1
the team denied the accusation			0
he is owed $ 86 million by the @entity7 over the last four seasons of his record $ 275 million , 10 - year contract			1
if he is suspended for the bulk of next season , the team has a chance to get under the luxury tax threshold of $ 189 million			0
but the length of any suspension will be decided by either @entity9 or in an agreement among mr @entity4 , @entity11 and the union			2
' i will be there every day , ' mr @entity4 said			0
' i 'm fighting for my life and my whole legacy			0

long - awaited arbitration hearings begin monday and are expected to last through the week
if the suspension is upheld , it would *effectively* end @entity4 's *divisive* playing career
the 38 - year - old third baseman is still owed almost $ *90million* by the @entity7
