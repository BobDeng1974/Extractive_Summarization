judge @entity21 upheld her discrimination claim , and found mrs @entity0 was treated unfairly ‘ not because of her lack of qualifications or lack of ability , but the difference in her race			1
’ mrs @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m very pleased with the judgement , but sitting though the hearing and reading the verdict has bought it all back			0
‘ i ’m not sure i will ever teach again , and it ’s made me think what i ’m going to do with my life			0
it was an awful experience , and one which i ’m terrified of going through again			0
’ the hearing , which took place at @entity39 in @entity40 , heard mrs @entity0 first applied for a job at the @entity42 through an agency at the end of 2011			0
she stated she wanted a more senior role and was particularly interested in the head of maths vacancy , but went on to accept a job as a £ 40,000 - a - year teacher in april 2012			1
bosses at the @entity1 felt she was unsuitable for a management role because she had taken a five - year break to have a child , but failed to give her any formal feedback			1

but it turned out there was no funding available for the role			0

judge @entity80 said : ‘ it is our judgement that mr @entity69 was appointed without interview , without any objective assessment of his suitability for this post and without responding to an advert			2
‘ mr @entity69 was effectively “ tapped on the shoulder ” and invited to apply			0
this is totally different from the claimant ’s situation where her agency had put her cv forward and asked that she be considered for the post			0
’ the judge stated that because of these differences , ' we can infer less favourable treatment on the grounds of race '			2
claim : mrs @entity0 first applied for a job at the @entity42 through an agency in 2011 mrs @entity104 - who gave up a job at @entity106 , a grammar school 12 miles away in @entity108 , @entity14 , to join the @entity42 - is set to be awarded compensation , but a date has not yet been scheduled for a further hearing			1

the @entity1 said in february this year that they had both been taken out of special measures			1
