@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 is planning a quick resolution to @entity4 's future once this weekend 's @entity6 title decider is resolved			1
@entity0 has long made it clear he wants @entity4 to remain at @entity1 by signing an extension to a contract that expires at the end of next year			1
@entity0 , however , has previously further stated he would not allow any talks to impact on @entity4 's focus whilst he fights with team - mate @entity13 for a championship that has gone down to the wire			1
come early next week , @entity0 will then sit down with @entity4 and , he hopes , get him to put pen to paper on a new deal			1
' we very much want him to stay for many more years , ' said @entity0			2
' he 's great for the team , part of the family and the relationship we all enjoy is more than a professional racing relationship between driver and team			2
' it is on a different level and so our wish would very much be for that to continue for many more years			0
' of course , we agreed with each other not to sit down at a table and negotiate terms of a contract and numbers when what @entity4 needed was to concentrate on his driving			1
@entity0 ( front far right ) is keen for @entity4 to extend his contract after the championship finishes @entity13 ( near ) pipped @entity4 to victory at the @entity57 gp to set up a nail - biting season finale ' we did that very consciously , even when the rumours accelerated around other drivers and our team			1
' we sat down again and said ' should we maybe take those conversations forward ? ' we decided it was not the best thing to do			0
' so on the monday or tuesday after @entity19 we will sit down and discuss and hopefully find a solution quickly			0
' @entity0 and non-executive chairman @entity67 will now be dealing with @entity4 directly rather than via management company @entity68 after the 29 - year - old recently opted to drop @entity71 's organisation			1
@entity0 feels that will not pose a problem , adding : ' @entity4 is a very intelligent and mature person now who knows more about @entity6 than many other managers out there			1
' i think he can represent himself in a good way , he has good support from consultants , be it legal , tax or whatever , so he has a good set - up around him and he 's a very clever guy			2
@entity4 's team - mate @entity13 ( right ) is 17 points behind the @entity86 going into sunday 's race @entity0 said he hopes @entity4 stays at @entity1 for ' many more years ' ' we have discussions around various topics very regularly			1
last week , for example , we spent an hour discussing various commercial issues			0
' he knows what he wants and is straight about it , so i think that is not at all detrimental to him			0
on the contrary it is more efficient for us			0
' as far as @entity0 is concerned , that is all part of the development of @entity4 's character he has noticed since his arrival at the team			1
' it is the way he has matured over the last two years , the way he has grown into the team , ' assessed @entity0			2
' he feels in a better place in his life , that he has sorted out some of his private issues			0
' he also has a good relationship with the team , he feels at home and the personalities with whom he deals with have been open to him			0
' then there is the valuable contribution he brings to the team , not only as a racing driver , but as someone who motivates by embracing the team and giving us valuable inputs on the commercial side			0
i respect that a lot			0
' the development of @entity4 ' personality has been quite astonishing			2

@entity4 's @entity1 contract expires at the end of next year
@entity1 boss @entity0 hope to tie @entity4 down to a new contract
the pair agreed not to discuss terms until the season is over
title race between @entity4 and @entity13 will be decided on sunday
@entity4 leads his team - mate by 17 points and needs to finish second to claim the title
