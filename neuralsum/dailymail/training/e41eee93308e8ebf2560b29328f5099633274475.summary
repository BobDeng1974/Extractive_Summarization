@entity0 has taken an incredible selfie of its 131ft solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space			1
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity6 , with its distinct ‘ head ’ and ‘ body ’ clearly visible			0
the image was taken on 7 september by @entity0 's landing craft @entity11 at a distance of 31 miles ( 50km ) from the comet			1
in the background , is the duck - shaped comet , @entity6 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible two images with different exposure times were patched together to help highlight the details			0
it was created as part of the preparations being made by the lander team for the first ever attempt to land on a comet			1
five possible landing sites , which appeared to be flat and relatively smooth , were chosen last month			1
but as @entity0 has edged closer to the comet , its uneven surface has come into focus , suggesting that the landing sites will be more risky than first thought			1
yesterday , a colourful map revealing its stunning landscape was unveiled by mission scientists in @entity41 following data sent back from the probe			1
several different surface regions are shown in this map , which is oriented with the comet 's ' body ' in the foreground and the ' head ' in the background			1
the map is expected to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in november - the first time a landing on a comet has ever been attempted the map shows @entity56 ’s ‘ continents ’ based on the variations on the comet ’s surface			1
@entity60 told @entity61 that the colours do not represent specific formations on the comet , but do indicate that they are different regions			0
various areas are dominated by cliffs , depressions , craters , boulders and even parallel grooves , with some regions still being shaped by the comet ’s activity			0
as both @entity76 and @entity0 travel closer to the sun over the next months , the mission control team will monitor the surface looking for changes			1
while the scientists do n’t expect the borderlines of the comet ’s regions to vary dramatically , more subtle transformations could help explain more about how comets form			0
jagged cliffs and prominent boulders are visible in this image taken by on 5 september 2014 from a distance of 39 miles ( 62km ) from comet @entity56			2
the left part of the image shows a side view of the comet 's ' body ' , while the right is the back of its ' head '			1
one pixel corresponds to 3.6ft ( 1.1 metres ) next weekend , on 13 and 14 september , the maps will play a key role as @entity0 ’s @entity101 and the @entity0 orbiter scientists to decide where they will park the @entity11 lander			1
an announcement on their decision will be made on 15 september			1
once @entity11 leaves @entity0 to head for @entity109 , there will be no chance to alter its path			2
it will take between five and eight hours to reach the comet ’s surface and be pulled in by its weak gravity			2
earlier this week , @entity0 uncovered some surprising features about comet @entity56			2
instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity76 is in fact darker than charcoal in some wavelengths of light			2
and scientists working on @entity0 ’s @entity126 instrument have so far failed to find any large patches of water - ice on @entity76 ’s surface			2
an artist 's impression of the @entity132 at comet @entity56			0
instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity76 is in fact darker than charcoal @entity0 has measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70 ° @entity139 )			1
although it may seem cold , that is actually 20 to @entity141 ( 36 to 54 ° f ) warmer than predicted for a comet at that distance , suggesting its surface will be quite dusty in addition to being icy			0
' this result is very interesting , since it gives us the first clues on the composition and physical properties of the comet ’s surface , ' says @entity155 principal investigator @entity154 from @entity156 , @entity157			0
this suggests that much of the surface must be dusty , because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice			0
‘ we 're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet 's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water - ice it shows , ’ said @entity163 , @entity126 principal investigator at the @entity164 in @entity165			1
scientists had previously believed the comet ’s surface would contain ice because it was too far away for the sun ’s warmth to melt it			0
the lack of ice could suggest that the comet had been in close with our sun , or a different star , at some point during its journey in deep space			0
they also found that the ' coma ' - or atmosphere - around the comet contains of hydrogen and oxygen			0
this is surprising as comas are generally thought to be composed of water vapour and dust			0
described as ‘ the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever ’ , @entity0 will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on @entity199			2
the comet itself is about 2.5 miles ( 4km ) long and orbits the sun every six - and - a - half years			0
it is heading towards the sun , so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more			0
for a sense of scale , the comet is about three times the size of @entity208 and @entity0 is the size of a car with 105ft ( 32 metre ) wings			1
zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity0 is at the moment five sites were identified on @entity6 during the @entity217 meeting held 23 – 24 august			2
the approximate locations of the five regions are marked on these @entity221 narrow - angle camera images taken on 16 august from a distance of about 62 miles ( 100km )			0

5 landing sites , which appeared to be flat , were chosen last month
but map shows the comet 's surface is more uneven than first thought
mission control team will monitor comet 's surface looking for changes
@entity245 zones for a landing on comet will be unveiled on 15 september
