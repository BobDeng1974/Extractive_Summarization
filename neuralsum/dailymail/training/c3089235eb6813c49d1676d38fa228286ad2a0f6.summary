@entity0 was by far the largest and most influential super pac in that campaign year			1
last month , one @entity40 ad used spliced images of @entity2 with rowdy @entity5 protesters to claim that she ' sides with extreme left ' protesters who ' attack police , do drugs and trash public parks			1
' @entity2 at one point said her philosophies provided the intellectual underpinnings for the @entity120 , but she has backed off a bit , saying she supports the movement but that the protesters must follow the law			1
a second @entity40 ad then painted @entity2 as being too cozy with @entity10 when she headed a congressional panel that oversaw the @entity92 's handling of the $ 700 billion financial industry bailout , a charge @entity2 has dismissed as ridiculous given her background as a consumer advocate and leading critic of many @entity10 's practices			1
