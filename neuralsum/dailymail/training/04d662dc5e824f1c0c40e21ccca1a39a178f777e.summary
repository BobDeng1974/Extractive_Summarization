over the course of a year , 2.2 million flights blanket the skies above the @entity3 - peaking at 8,000 in a single day			1
these flights are managed by @entity5 ( formerly known as @entity5 ) , which is responsible for monitoring airspace above more than 180 public and private airports , military training flights centres and helipads			1
to put this ' spider 's web ' of traffic into perspective , @entity5 has produced the third in its series of air traffic visualisations , taking a tour of the @entity3 ’s airspace , called @entity3 24			1
flights peak at more than 8,000 a day and the visualisation plots 7,000 of these movements ‘ following the success of our two data visualisations - @entity30 24 and @entity31 - we ’ve taken a lot of time to think about where to go next , ’ said head of operational policy , @entity25			1
‘ both @entity30 24 and @entity31 were designed to give an overview of the daily complexity and volumes of air traffic across the @entity3 and @entity30 and to do so in a way that was cinematic and exciting to watch			2
‘ i think we were able to do that to great effect , but we now want to take you a little deeper			0
‘ we are therefore very excited to publish @entity3 24 - your guided tour to some of what makes @entity3 aviation work			0
’ during the visualisation , around 7,000 flights are shown entering and leaving @entity3 airspace			1
the day starts with the bow wave of transatlantic traffic heading towards the @entity3 on organised and separated tracks			1
this is joined by traffic from @entity30 and the first waves of departures from @entity3 airports			1
traffic levels are then seen growing to reveal the main ‘ trunk roads ’ , or routes , of airspace as well as the hubs around @entity64 , @entity65 and central @entity66			1
the visualisation then shows holding stacks over @entity64 , also known as a holding manoeuvre that is used to delay a flight from landing , but keep it within the airspace			0
the tour then moves around the @entity3 to include the other major airports and @entity5 ’ two control centres in @entity19 and @entity20			2
there are also visualisations of military training flights , showing @entity81 jets performing manoeuvres training off the east coast of @entity84 and near to @entity85			2
it then reveals a ‘ spider ’s web of helicopter tracks ’ originating in @entity89 , taking people and supplies to @entity95 oil and gas rigs			1

this is particularly key around @entity119 , continued mr @entity25 , which provides ‘ the constant flow of traffic that makes it the world ’s busiest dual runway airport with 1,350 movements a day			0
’ at @entity119 alone , goods worth £ 133 billion were shipped in and out last year , more than the combined value of goods transiting through the @entity3 ’s two largest ports , @entity130 and @entity131			0
the tour then moves around the @entity3 to include the other major airports , @entity5 ’ two control centres in @entity19 and @entity20 , and general aviation traffic			2

it then reveals a ‘ spider ’s web of helicopter tracks ’ that originate from @entity89 , taking people and supplies to and from the @entity95 oil and gas rigs			2
‘ we hope you enjoy this insight into the complexity and beauty of a day of @entity3 air traffic and the value of airspace as the invisible infrastructure that makes it all work , ’ added mr @entity25			0
to create the video , visualisation experts from a company called 422 @entity163 combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all @entity3 flights			2
computer artists then used specially developed software to convert the longitude , latitude and height data into luminous dots , which were accurately positioned over satellite images of @entity3 , by day and by night			0
earlier this year , @entity5 and @entity173 , released a similar video called @entity175			0
it showed 2,524 flights crossing the @entity177 , of which 1,273 pass through the @entity178			0
at its busiest , traffic can peak at 1,500 flights a day in the summer			0

around 80 per cent of all @entity197 passes through it			0
the firm 's @entity30 visualisation was an amalgamation of @entity3 radar data , taken on 21 june 2013 , combined with @entity30 flight plan information from 28 july last year			0
the day starts with the bow wave of transatlantic traffic heading towards the @entity3 on organised and separated tracks			1
this is joined by traffic from @entity30 and the first waves of departures from @entity3 airports			1

the total distance flown by these aircraft is 25 million nautical miles - the equivalent to 998 times around the @entity234 or 104 trips to the @entity236			0
on 21 june 2013 , 5,675 aircraft departed or arrived from @entity3 airports , this included 847 from @entity238 and 1,041 from @entity119			0
the rest ( 1,532 ) were classed as overflights which travelled over the country			0
the @entity5 video is 1440x faster than real time			0
it then reveals a ‘ spider ’s web of helicopter tracks ’ that originate from @entity89 , taking people and vital supplies to and from the @entity95 oil and gas rigs ( pictured ) the visualisation then shows holding stacks over @entity64 , also known as a holding manoeuvre that is used to delay a flight from landing , but keep it within the airspace			1
this is particularly key around @entity119 ( pictured ) , which provides a constant flow of traffic that makes it the world ’s busiest dual runway airport with 1,350 movements a day			0

more than 2.2 million flights are managed by @entity5 ( formerly known as @entity5 ) in @entity3 airspace
flights peak at more than 8,000 a day and the visualisation plots 7,000 of these movements during 24 hours
the day begins with transatlantic traffic heading towards the @entity3 on separated and organised tracks
this is joined by traffic from @entity30 and the first waves of departures from @entity3 airports
traffic levels then grow to show main @entity3 routes , as well as hubs around @entity64 , @entity65 and central @entity66
visualisation also plots helicopters taking supplies to the @entity95 oil rig and @entity81 military training over @entity288
