a row involving some of the most senior legal figures in the country erupted yesterday over accusations that a judge was removed from a trial of journalists to ‘ improve the prospect of conviction ’			1
lawyers representing four @entity11 journalists accused of illegally paying public officials for stories claimed ‘ something funny had been going on behind the scenes ’ after a judge who heard their first trial – which ended with a hung jury – was suddenly removed			1
judge @entity20 emailed defence barristers following the move saying : ‘ it has been decided ( not by me but by my elders and betters ) that i am not going to be doing the retrial			1
’ @entity27 , @entity28 , speaking on behalf of the accused , demanded an explanation yesterday , saying the secretive ‘ backstage manoeuvre ’ was highly unusual and unfair			0
mr @entity31 , left , denied that judge @entity20 , right , was replaced to increase the chance of a conviction during the retrial of four @entity11 journalists who all deny making unlawful payments to public officials but one of the @entity40 ’s top judges , mr @entity31 , reacted with fury to the suggestion that judge @entity20 had been replaced by judge @entity44 simply to secure more convictions in a retrial			1
judge @entity47 is the only judge to have presided over a trial where there has been a successful conviction of a journalist over unlawful payments to public officials for stories , after a succession of similar cases have ended in acquittals			2
mr @entity27 told the @entity58 yesterday that time and money would be saved if judge @entity20 continued to handle the case			1
but mr @entity31 blasted his submission as ‘ absurd ’			2
raising his voice , he thundered : ‘ it might be thought to be a sad day when it is suggested that ... a fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that a judge exercising a judicial function had deliberately taken or approved an administrative decision to inappropriately favour one side over the other in litigation of any type			0
judge @entity47 , pictured , will handle the retrial which is expected to start at @entity76 on september 21			0
‘ i wish to state , emphatically , that @entity77 was not chosen , or approved , because of his view to date ( on a critical legal issue in the case )			0
nor was he chosen , or approved , in order to improve the prospects of conviction of these defendants			0
‘ in any event , the suggestion made is absurd			0
this is simply the replacement , for good reason as one would surely expect , of one fair judge by another fair judge			0
’ mr @entity31 went on to say judge @entity20 ’s email had been ‘ significantly misconstrued ’ , adding that his words were meant to be ‘ light hearted ’			1
he also rejected suggestions that the decision was made in secret , saying @entity77 was been appointed in an ‘ administrative judicial decision ’ because judge @entity20 was already committed to several trials this year			1
the @entity11 ’s head of news @entity99 , former managing editor @entity98 , reporter @entity98 and former deputy news editor @entity101 all deny unlawful payments to public officials for stories			0
last month a jury failed to reach a verdict on the majority of the charges			0
judge @entity20 ordered a retrial and told the court the case would be scheduled at @entity76 on september 21 and it would be preferable if i was to deal with it ’			1
when he was removed defence barristers objected , pointing out that judge @entity20 had made a ruling on a key element on the charges , while the new judge had taken a different view in a case with similar charges			2
but mr @entity31 , who took responsibility for the switch as @entity43 on the @entity124 , said the legal issue would be settled by the @entity126			2

lawyers have asked why a trial judge has been replaced for the retrial
@entity11 journalists are awaiting retrial concerning payments to officials
judge @entity20 emailed barristers saying he was not hearing retrial
mr @entity31 reacted *angrily* when *questioned* over the decision
he denied @entity77 was appointed to increase chance of a conviction
