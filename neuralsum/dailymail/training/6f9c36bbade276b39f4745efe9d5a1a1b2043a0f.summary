this does not even include disputes which have not been resolved or are looming			2
@entity46 , assistant general secretary of @entity41 , said strike action had risen because working people have simply ‘ had enough ’			0
he said : ‘ they have had enough of a failed , ideological economic strategy of austerity , real term pay cuts , rising costs and little hope			0
‘ the only growth experienced by most workers is a devastating growth in poverty and food - banks supporting the most vulnerable while everyday costs in rip - off @entity61 such as rent , transport , food and energy force more into debt and often , despair			2

pictured , striking @entity70 workers on @entity71 ‘ people are rightly outraged when they see the richest in society pocket millions in wage hikes , bonuses , share options and pension pots , much of which appears to be whisked away to the nearest tax haven rather than being spent in the local economy to support jobs and businesses			0
’ mr @entity46 indicated that industrial unrest will continue into the new year and even leading up to the general election			0
several high profile disputes remain unresolved , including those in the @entity70 , fire service and civil service , as well as in the private sector			0
