this week the world has been amazed by the story of a @entity3 pensioner who is pregnant with quadruplets at the age of 65			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , is already a mother of 13 but decided to expand her family further after her youngest child told her : ' i want to have a little brother or sister			2
' someone who understands @entity6 's position well is @entity15 's older mother , @entity13 , from @entity16			1
now seven , @entity25 has often asked her mother if she could have a brother or sister and as a result , @entity13 revealed that she did consider it			1
' @entity25 went through a period of wanting a sibling and i looked into fertility treatment to have another child but because i 've had health issues i decided not to push my luck , ' she said on today 's @entity18			1
the retired special needs teacher said ' in a way ' she thinks @entity6 is ' selfish ' for having more babies at her age - despite leaving motherhood till late in life herself			1
she said : ' she has 13 children already , in my case i had n't had any			0
but if she has thought about it and weighed up the positive and negative and said " this is the right thing for me " then that 's her decision			1
i do n't sit in judgement of anyone else			0
' now aged 64 , @entity13 told presenters @entity51 and @entity53 that she never intended to leave parenthood so late			1
@entity13 , left , became pregnant thanks to @entity56 when she was 57			1
@entity6 , right , is expecting at 65 but after her father passed away , she became a carer for her poorly mother until her death in 2002 , while juggling her challenging job			2
' i had other things in my life , looking after my mum and having a responsible job , i did n't think i could handle being mum then , ' she explained			0
' i always hoped when i was younger i would have a child but thought i had missed boat			0
' then @entity13 met @entity69 , a warehouse manager , when she was 51 and he was 11 years her junior			2
she warned him she was menopausal and they would be unlikely to start a family together			0
but after researching fertility treatments , they were able to conceive on their third @entity56 attempt after getting a donor egg fertilised with @entity69 's sperm and implanted in @entity13 's womb			1
@entity13 was delighted when daughter @entity25 was born although she admits she now wishes she could have had her sooner			1
she said : ' i do n't regret having her but i do regret not having her when i was younger			0
' the journey i have taken with her over the last seven years has been fantastic but what saddens me sometimes is when i look at her and look at myself i wonder how much time i have left with her			2
' i 'm hoping i can make 80 when she 'll be 22			0
' @entity13 pictured with daughter @entity25 in 2012			1
she now wishes she could have had her when she was younger @entity13 is now a single parent after splitting up with @entity69 amicably in 2010			2
she said the pressures of being new parents took its toll on their relationship			0
' we grew apart because when you have a child your focus is on the child 24/7			0
the partner may feel pushed out or carries on living their own life as before , while you do n't			0
my life took totally different turn			0
' as a result of her experience , @entity13 believes the cut - off for @entity56 treatment should be age 60			1
following @entity13 's appearance on the show , @entity18 asked viewers to phone in with their views on older parents			1
@entity107 called into urge older parents to reassure their children about their health			0
she said her mother had her when she was in her fifties - and so was the same age as her friends ' grandparents			2
she said throughout her childhood she felt terrified that her mother was going to die			0
meanwhile @entity117 , who has had six children between the ages of 18 and 40 , said she 's noticed a difference in her energy levels since having her youngest child at an older age			1
' it 's hard work , i do n't know how women in their fifties cope , ' she said			0
but another caller , @entity129 , who had her fourth baby at the age of 41 , said she 's fitter and healthier now than when she had her first baby in her 20s .			2
