by @entity0 when a party of storm - chasing tourists joined guide @entity5 on the hunt for tornadoes , they were looking for the thrill of a lifetime			1
and they got more than they bargained for when one formed right beside their minibus and hurled a heavy crop sprayer into the windscreen			1
the group had been speeding along a lonely highway near the town of @entity20 , @entity21 , with ominous grey skies hanging over them , trying to reach a tornado they had spotted in the distance			1
@entity26 : @entity5 and his group of storm - chasing tourists had been speeding down this isolated highway near the town of @entity20 , @entity21 , when they suddenly got a bigger thrill than they bargained for it 's as they pass the spindly arms of this crop duster that they realise a tornado is forming beside them quick thinking : realising that the tornado is about to pass right over the minibus , mr @entity5 takes evasive action , steering into the wind to stop the vehicle from being rolled over passengers in the minibus must have been horrified to see the incoming crop duster , headed straight for them it hit the windscreen with a resounding crack , but the toughened glass held despite the heavy impact then , without warning , a second tornado began forming in the field next to them			1
realising they would be foolish to stop and gawp , mr @entity5 speeds up in an effort to drive to safety			2
but with the twister heading straight over them , there 's nothing for it but to take evasive action and they turn into the wind - as the storm throws the crop sprayer straight into the front of their minibus			1
' i 've got to admit it was pretty scary , ' said mr @entity5			0
' we were trying to drive away from a storm when a tornado formed beside the car from nowhere			1
' i did n't really know what to do and had to try steer into the wind to prevent the car from flipping			2
' he added : ' there was just no real opportunity to get out of its way			0
if we had been going a little slower or a little faster things could have been very different - we were lucky			2
' despite having just survived driving through a tornado , the damage to the minibus was actually pretty slight mr @entity5 , of @entity87 , @entity88 , quit his engineering job to take up life as an adventurer 16 years ago			0
each spring , he leads parties across the @entity93 chasing tornadoes			0
' the party had all paid to be on the storm chasing trip and i know a lot of them were scared but that 's what they pay their money for , ' he said			0
' that 's the beauty of storm chasing - it 's unpredictable			0
you never know what 's going to happen next			0
