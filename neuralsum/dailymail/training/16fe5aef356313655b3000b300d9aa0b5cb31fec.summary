the hijackers of missing jet @entity2 must have crawled through a trap door in full view of cabin crew to cut a key datalink with the ground , it was revealed today			1
investigators said a system called @entity11 was switched off on the @entity13 @entity12 at some point between 1.07am and 1.37am - after it vanished from controllers ' radars			1
the flight is then believed to have flown into a navigational and technical black hole , a feat that could only be achieved by experienced pilots who had meticulously planned in advance			1
pilots have revealed hijackers must have crawled through trap door in in flight @entity2 's galley in full view of cabin crew ' to disable second communications system			1
this graphic shows whether trap door would be probe : police in @entity13 have searched the home of pilot @entity33 ( right ) and @entity2 ( left ) after officials confirmed the plane was taken over by a ' deliberate act ' @entity11 is designed to transmit maintenance data back to the ground and was the second communications system to switched off on the flight			1
the first , the transponder , had been disabled in the cockpit two minutes after the last verbal contact was made with air traffic control			1
but pilots revealed today cutting the @entity11 datalink would have been much more difficult and instructions are not in the flight crew @entity46			1
whoever did so may have had to climb through a trap door in full view of cabin crew , people familiar with the jet say			0
circuit - breakers used to disable the system are in a bay reached through a hatch in the floor next to the lefthand front exit , close to a galley used to prepare meals			1
another pilot , who did not want to be identified , said : ' occasionally , there are gaps in the communications systems and the guys in ground operations may not think much of it initially			2
experts have claimed the @entity70 dropped 5,000ft ( 1,500m ) to evade commercial radar detection ' it would be a while before they try to find out what was wrong			2
' most of the pilots said it would be impossible to turn off @entity11 from inside the cockpit , though two people did not rule it out			1
@entity80 said 14 minutes elapsed between the last @entity11 message and the transponder shutdown that - in the growing view of officials - confirmed a fully loaded jet was on the run			1
the @entity11 must have been disabled within 16 minutes after that			1
in the meantime a voice believed to be that of the co-pilot issued the last words from @entity2 and the transponder went dead			1
by choosing one place and time to vanish into radar darkness with 238 others on board , the person - presumed to be a pilot or a passenger with advanced knowledge - may have acted only after meticulous planning , according to aviation experts			1
@entity13 @entity104 shows pictures of his son @entity106 , an aviation engineer , who was onboard the missing flight , in @entity108 , @entity13 @entity13 's transport ministry released this satellite map of the north corridor of the possible location of the missing @entity2 the hunt : @entity13 defence minister and acting transport minister @entity115 ( right ) show north corridor and south corridor maps this graphic shows the location of the @entity70 's @entity120 , in the rear of the plane he signed off from @entity13 airspace at 1.19am on march 8 with a casual ' all right , good night , ' rather than the crisp radio drill advocated in pilot training , a person now believed to be the co-pilot gave no hint of anything unusual			1
two minutes later , at 1.21 a.m. local time , the transponder - a device identifying jets to ground controllers - was turned off in a move that experts say could reveal a careful sequence			1
' every action taken by the person who was piloting the aircraft appears to be a deliberate one			2
it is almost like a pilot 's checklist , ' said one senior captain from an @entity147 carrier with experience of jets including the @entity70			0
there is so far no indication whether the co-pilot was at fault or had anything to do with turning off the transponder			2
pilots say the usual industry convention is that the pilot not directly responsible for flying the plane talks on the radio			0
anxious wait : @entity162 , whose husband @entity106 was onboard the missing @entity2 , kisses her daughter inside a hotel they are staying at in @entity108 anxious wait : @entity168 relatives of passengers aboard a missing @entity80 are still waiting to find out happened to their loved ones hotel security officers guard at an entrance of a hotel room set aside for relatives of passengers aboard a missing @entity80 plane in @entity177 police have searched the premises of both the captain and co-pilot and are checking the backgrounds of all passengers			1
whoever turned the transponder to ' off ' , whether or not the move was deliberate , did so at a vulnerable point between two airspace sectors when @entity13 and @entity190 controllers could easily assume the airplane was each others ' responsibility			2
' the predictable effect was to delay the raising of the alarm by either party , ' @entity194 , operations and safety editor at @entity196 , wrote in an industry blog			0
that mirrors delays in noticing something was wrong when an @entity206 jet disappeared over the @entity207 in 2009 with 228 people on board , a gap blamed on confusion between controllers			0
yet whereas the @entity216 disaster was later traced to pilot error , the suspected kidnapping of @entity2 's passengers and crew was carried out with either skill or bizarre coincidences			1
residents of @entity222 light candles to spell ' @entity2 ' during a @entity224 ceremony , praying for the missing @entity2 , in @entity225 @entity227 residents of a community light candles as they pray for the missing @entity2 at their village in @entity225 whether or not pilots knew it , the jet was just then in a technically obscure sweet spot , according to a top radar expert			1
air traffic controllers use secondary radar which works by talking to the transponder			2
some air traffic control systems also blend in some primary radar , which uses a simple echo			2
but primary radar signals fade faster than secondary ones , meaning even a residual blip would have vanished for controllers and even military radar may have found it difficult to identify the 777 from other ghostly blips , said radar expert @entity248			0
' turning off the transponder indicates this person was highly trained , ' said @entity248 , of consultancy @entity252			2
the overnight flight to @entity177 from @entity255 is packed year - round with business people , @entity168 tourists and students , attracted in part by code - sharing deals , regular travellers say			2
family members of passengers onboard @entity2 vote to talk directly to @entity13 government 's representatives relatives of passengers of a missing @entity80 plane gather at a television viewing area to watch news programs in a hotel in @entity177 the lockdown of @entity2 may have begun as early as 40 minutes into the flight at a point when meals are being hurriedly served in time to get trays cleared and lights dimmed for the night			1
' it was a red - eye flight			2
most people - the passengers and the crew - just want to rest , ' a @entity80 stewardess said			0
' unless there was a reason to panic , if someone had taken control of the aircraft , they would not have noticed anything			1
' the north - east - bound jet took a north - western route from @entity291 in eastern @entity13 to @entity292			0
it was last detected on military radar around 200 miles northwest of @entity292			0
even that act of going off course may not have caused alarm at first if it was handled gradually , pilots said			0
' nobody pays attention to these things unless they are aware of the direction that the aircraft was heading in , ' said one first officer who has flown with @entity80			0
the airline said it had reconstructed the event in a simulator to try to figure out how the jet vanished and kept flying for what may have been more than seven hours			0
pilots say whoever was then in control may have kept the radio on in silent mode to hear what was going on around him , but would have avoided restarting the transponder at all costs			1
' that would immediately make the aircraft visible ... like a bright light			0
your registration , height , altitude and speed would all become visible , ' said an airline captain			0
after casting off its identity , the aircraft set investigators a puzzle that has yet to be solved			0
it veered either northwards or southwards , within an hour 's flying time of arcs stretching from the @entity337 to the southern @entity338			0
the best way to avoid the attention of military radars would have been to fly at a fixed altitude , on a recognised flight path and at cruising speed without changing course , pilots say			0
@entity13 officials dismissed as speculation reports that the jet may have flown at low altitude to avoid detection			0
but pilots said the best chance of feeling its way through the well - defended northern route would have been to hide in full view of military radar inside commercial lanes - raising awkward questions over security in several parts of the @entity360			0
' the military radar controllers would have seen him moving on a fixed line , figured that it was a commercial aircraft at a high altitude , and not really a danger especially if he was on a recognised flight path , ' said one pilot			2
' some countries would ask you to identify yourself , but you are flying through the night and that is the time when the least attention is being paid to unidentified aircraft			0
as long as the aircraft is not flying towards a military target or point , they may not bother with you			0
' although investigators refused on monday to be drawn into theories , few in the industry believe a 250 - tonne passenger jet could run amok globally without expert skills or preparation			0
' whoever did this must have had lots of aircraft knowledge , would have deliberately planned this , had nerves of steel to be confident enough to get through primary radar without being detected and been confident enough to control an aircraft full of people , ' a veteran airline captain said .			1

@entity11 system was switched off between 1.07am and 1.37am
it followed last verbal communication and transponder turn off
flight then flew into a navigational and technical black hole
@entity11 designed to transmit maintenance data back to ground
but to disable it would require ' lots of aircraft knowledge '
experts have said taking control would take meticulous planning
lockdown of @entity2 may have begun as early as *40m* into the flight
