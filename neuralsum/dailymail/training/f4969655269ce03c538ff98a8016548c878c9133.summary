@entity0 marked his return to the @entity2 starting line - up by scoring after just nine minutes in a convincing 5 - 1 win over @entity5 that gave @entity7 ’s team their 13th straight victory			1
the @entity9 , who also hit the crossbar in the second half , has seen @entity2 win their last seven games as he recovered from a @entity14 injury and some supporters have made no secret of the desire to seem the team left unchanged but he came in for @entity19 on saturday night at the @entity20 and helped @entity2 to yet another comfortable win			0
@entity22 played @entity23 in behind the @entity5 defence and the @entity26 midfielder crossed from the left for @entity0 to swoop at the back post and convert the centre for the opener			1
@entity2 winger @entity0 celebrates after scoring the opening goal against @entity5 @entity2 : @entity32 5 , @entity33 6 , @entity34 8 , @entity35 7 , @entity36 7 , @entity23 9 , @entity37 8 , @entity0 7 , @entity38 6 , @entity22 7 , @entity39 7 goals : @entity0 9 , @entity35 40 , @entity23 56 , @entity39 59 , @entity22 83 @entity5 : @entity41 6 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 5 , @entity44 5 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 7 goal : @entity49 44 @entity2 doubled their lead just before the break when @entity38 's corner from the right dropped for @entity35 , who hooked the ball in with his knee after @entity34 failed to reach it			1
@entity2 looked to be cruising at this point but @entity38 blotted his copybook with a poor back pass that appeared to allow @entity5 back into the game just before the half - time whistle			1
the @entity65 had time on the ball but rolled it back to goalkeeper @entity68 and @entity51 stole in and crossed for @entity49 to bring @entity5 back into the match			0
the @entity2 - based minnows are famed for combining fine attacking football with kamikaze defending and so it had been in the first 45 minutes but at least they kept 17 - goal @entity22 quiet			1
the @entity76 forward had showed off his @entity77 at the start of the match but failed to add to his season ’s tally in the first 45 minutes of the game			0
@entity5 had looked bright going forward with former @entity82 winger @entity50 , who was give his debut at @entity84 by @entity7 in 2009 , seeing plenty of the ball			0
@entity0 slids into goalkeeper @entity87 after scoring the opening goal @entity2 's @entity0 ( r ) celebrates his goal against @entity5 with team - mate @entity23 @entity0 celebrates scoring the opening goal against @entity5 at @entity20 at the start of the second half @entity5 looked to have equalised when @entity51 had the ball in the back of the net only to see it chalked off for a marginal offside			1
@entity2 went straight down the other end and made it 3 - 1 and the goal was the pick of the bunch			0
@entity22 crossed from the right and @entity23 passed the ball into the back of the net with the smoothest of finishes that curled just inside the post and beyond @entity41 ’s dive			0
@entity2 forward @entity22 holds off three defenders @entity2 's @entity22 shows his gold boot to supporters before saturday 's match within four minutes it was four and another very close offside call went against @entity5			1
@entity39 was the wrong side of the last @entity5 defender when @entity118 crossed from the right ; the linesman ’s flag should have been raised but he was not up with play and @entity39 celebrated his sixth league goal of the season			2
@entity5 had only won once in 15 games in the @entity20 and this was not going to be their night either			0
@entity0 ’s perfectly weighted pass found @entity22 and it might easily have been five			2
@entity0 then thundered a shot in from the edge of the area which @entity41 palmed on to his crossbar			0
all that was missing was a goal from @entity2 ’s top scorer @entity22 and with five minutes left it came with a shot that squirmed under @entity41 ’s body after @entity39 had intelligently held the ball up while the @entity76 came back from an offside position			2
@entity5 had lost this fixture 5 - 0 last season so they are getting closer to getting something from the fixture			2
the consolation is that at the moment they are not the only team who can not live with this @entity2 side			0
@entity35 scores the second goal for @entity2 against @entity5 @entity2 defender @entity35 blow a kiss after scoring the second goal			1

@entity0 scored after just nine minutes on his return from injury
@entity35 doubled lead before @entity38 's error gifted goal to @entity5
@entity22 sealed victory with his 24th goal of the season
