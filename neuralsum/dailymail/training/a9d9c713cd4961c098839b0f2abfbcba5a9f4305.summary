the survey found men who consumed more alcohol over 20 years were likely to suffer memory loss at a later age if you ’re a middle - aged man looking forward to a couple of pints tonight , you might want to stop at one			1
men in their 40s who drink just two pints of beer a day risk accelerating mental decline by up to six years by the time they reach retirement age			1
in the first long - term study of its kind , scientists tracked more than 5,000 @entity21 men for 20 years and found heavy drinking was behind premature damage to the memory			1
moderate drinking , defined as less than 2.5 units a day – roughly a pint of beer or a large glass of wine – was found to have no effect on memory , reasoning or problem solving			1
but men who drank more than 4.5 units a day – less than two pints or two large glasses of wine – suffered a deterioration in their ability to recall information , the equivalent to an extra six years of ageing			1
and the decline of the brain ’s ‘ executive function ’ – which includes attention span and reasoning skills – was hastened by an extra year and a half			2
the study , carried out by scientists at @entity52 , involved tracking the drinking habits of 5,054 civil servants over a ten - year period until the late 1990s , and then testing their mental ability over the next ten years until 2009			2
dr @entity57 , lead author of the study , said : ‘ much of the research evidence about drinking and a relationship to memory and executive function is based on older populations			0
‘ our study focused on middle - aged participants and suggests that heavy drinking is associated with faster decline in all areas of cognitive function in men			2
’ those classed as heavy drinkers performed significantly worse than the light drinkers , with a memory decline equivalent to an extra six years over the decade			1
file image the participants , who were in their mid- 40s when they were recruited , were quizzed three times during the first decade to establish how much , how often , and what they were drinking			0
the second stage was to analyse their cognitive function			0
each man was assessed three times over the next ten years , starting at age 56 on average and ending when they were 66			0
those classed as heavy drinkers performed significantly worse than the light drinkers , with a memory decline equivalent to an extra six years over the decade			1
the heavy drinkers also fared worse in experiments testing their verbal fluency and mathematical ability			0
the results showed their decline in general cognitive ability and executive function was accelerated by a year and a half , compared to those who did not drink at all			2
some 2,099 women also took part in the experiment			0
those who drank more than two units a day tended to show an accelerated cognitive decline , but researchers said the results were not strong enough to be statistically significant , and said they could not draw any conclusions			1
the study , published in the journal @entity111 , concluded that ‘ heavy alcohol consumption in mid-life is likely to be harmful for cognitive ageing , at least in men ’			0
dr @entity57 admitted that the research relied on self - reported drinking , so ‘ some participants may have underestimated their consumption ’			0
dr @entity121 , of @entity122 , welcomed the study ‘ as one more reason to stick to any @entity126 ’s resolutions to cut back on alcohol ’ .			0
