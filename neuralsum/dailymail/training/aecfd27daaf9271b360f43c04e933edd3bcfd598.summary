by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 12:26 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 : 16:58 est , 20 december 2013 @entity4 is now believed to have played a leading role in the mysterious escape of a @entity8 businessman from @entity10 house arrest			1
the current location of @entity12 , an @entity13 from @entity14 who went to @entity10 to salvage a rice - growing business , is being kept a closely - guarded secret			2
but he is with the @entity20 - winning actor , who says he is receiving medical attention			2
the @entity10 government now regards @entity12 , an @entity13 from @entity14 who went to @entity10 to salvage a rice growing business , as a fugitive			1
the @entity20 - winning actor has been involved in mr @entity12 's plight ever since he was arrested in 2011 as part of a money laundering probe and even met with the president of @entity10 last year in an effort to get mr @entity12 moved from prison to house arrest			1
star power : @entity4 made a personal plea to the president of @entity10 to have @entity12 ( right ) moved from a violent prison to house arrest , given his innocence and increasingly frequent @entity40 's tremors on monday , @entity4 confirmed that mr @entity12 was freed as a result of a ' humanitarian operation ' to free him ' from the corrupt prosecution and imprisonment he was suffering in @entity10 '			1
in the email to the @entity46 , @entity4 said only that @entity12 was safe , doing well and receiving medical attention in the actor 's company at an undisclosed location			1
with @entity52 - @entity10 relations strained since @entity53 expelled the @entity52 ambassador in 2008 , @entity4 was one of the few people @entity12 could turn to			1
the actor was a frequent guest of the late @entity58 president @entity57 and a sharp critic of @entity52 foreign policy - two qualities that endear him to @entity53 and other leftist leaders in @entity63			0
after @entity4 intervened , @entity53 ordered a high - powered investigation that exposed an extortion ring that preyed on people accused of drug - related crimes			0
it led to the arrests of 15 people , including several prosecutors and the top legal adviser at the @entity73 , who had repeatedly flown from the capital to the eastern city of @entity76 for court hearings to ensure @entity12 was not freed from prison			0
center of a scandal : now @entity12 has escaped from @entity10 and @entity4 confirmed that he was with him - without revealing his location - and that the @entity14 - native was receiving medical treatment @entity12 was housed at a prison , @entity85 , whose interior was controlled by violent inmates			1
in august , 31 prisoners died in a battle between rival factions			0
adding to his troubles were the increasing tremors he was dealing with as his @entity40 worsened with poor treatment			0
he had been freed from jail in december 2012 at a hearing attended by @entity4 but barred from leaving @entity10			1
a frustrated @entity4 vowed he would n't abandon him			2
‘ if it were n't for @entity4 i would be another statistic in @entity10 and i would die in prison , ’ @entity12 told the @entity46 a year ago			1
previous efforts on his behalf by @entity52 diplomats and lawmakers had proved fruitless			0
@entity12 was released from prison a year ago and put under house arrest after actor @entity4 ( left ) , along with several @entity52 lawmakers , appealed to president @entity105 ( right ) to free him the @entity106 reports that once he was moved to house arrest , it was one of the most loosely - guarded situations imaginable , with no guards watching him			1
officially , he only had to be in the home between the hours of 9pm and 6am , and was told to check in with authorities every 15 days			0
now that word of his escape is causing political optics issues , @entity10 officials are floating the theory that he could have been kidnapped or even travelled to @entity119 on his own during the day when he was not confined to the house in @entity76			2
mr @entity12 's relatives are understandably keeping his whereabouts under wraps , though one of the @entity14 native 's children confirmed that they had heard he had arrived in @entity63 but had yet to speak to him directly			2
‘ you 'll never find out , ’ @entity127 , president emeritus of the @entity128 in @entity129 , said tuesday			0
if the @entity52 was involved , ‘ it was done through layers and layers of cover , ’ he said			0
mr @entity12 , an @entity13 who has a flooring business in @entity14 , complained from the time he was jailed in june 2011 that he was being fleeced by corrupt officials			0
transition : @entity12 leaves a court in a helmet and bulletproof vest after being released from a violent prison in favor of house arrest in @entity76 , on december 18 , 2012 his case came to notice when he accused the struggling rice venture 's original manager , a @entity148 woman who also was jailed , of defrauding investors and falling in with a @entity151 drug trafficker			1
@entity12 charged later that prosecutors and other government employees had illegally sold 18,000 metric tons of the venture 's rice and stole equipment as well as demanded a $ 50,000 payoff to get him out of jail			2
' they robbed me of close to $ 50 million worth of assets , ' @entity12 told the @entity46 in an interview a year ago			1
he said that in addition to the rice , about 900 cattle disappeared along with 37 tractors and harvesting equipment			0
@entity10 authorities have said since that 15 people had been arrested in the alleged extortion ring , including an assistant to the judicial director of the @entity73			0
last june , prosecutors said two low - ranking officials among those arrested had pleaded guilty and were cooperating in hopes of serving less jail time			0
the case has resulted in @entity10 authorities implicating a judge , the initial prosecutors and lower - level officials in an alleged scheme to shake down @entity12 and other people deemed to have deep pockets .			2

@entity187 official confirms @entity12 has left @entity10
@entity12 has n't spoken to his relatives but @entity4 said that he escaped as part of a ' humanitarian operation ' and is receiving medical help
@entity10 government officials said they did not know if he had left *country* and are now suggesting he was kidnapped or escaped from lax security
@entity12 spent 18 months in @entity10 jail without charge
he was released to house arrest a year ago after @entity4 made a *public* plea
