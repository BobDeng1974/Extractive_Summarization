he seemed much bigger and stronger than me			1
' i remember my leg was shivering			1
i was just holding the knife , but i did n't know if i was actually pushing it away - something gave me the strength to do something			1
i thought i was going , but my guardian angel must have been there to help me			1

i carry a crucifix on me and i happily gave it to her			2
' it was a reassurance to her - she said it made her feel better			2
she wrapped it around her hand and i think it was something she clinged on to			2
' she was the perfect person for this to happen to - because she is uber strong			2
i have come across some people that are unable to cope			0
the way she 's dealt with it is phenomenal			0

' i sat at the bus stop and i saw the man who looked very angry			0
he was waving the knife around and came towards me			0
when i saw the blade i put my hand up to protect my face			0
' i thought it was the end , he kept screaming â€˜ die , die , die ' , it happened so quick - within two minutes			0
the pain , i did n't even think of it , you do n't when you have to defend yourself			0
' i was just thinking how i could get away from him			0
when he pushed me against a fence , i thought that was the end of it			0

you saw her in some way as someone who was responsible and you carried out a frenzied attack			0
