@entity0 sizes a free - kick from 25 yards before curling with his left boot in to the top corner			1
@entity5 ghosts in to the area unnoticed before finishing with a diving header			1
two @entity9 shirts close on @entity10 only for him to pirouette and spin between the hapless pair			1
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , the teenage sons of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 who are now following in their father 's stud marks and are already the subject of @entity23 compilations			1
there are more ; @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27			1
then there are the @entity29 ; @entity30 ( little @entity31 ) and @entity32			1
@entity10 ( left ) has two sons in @entity35 's youth ranks , with 16 - year - old @entity36 ( right ) the youngest @entity37 , pictured in action for one of @entity35 's youth sides , is hoping to break into the first team @entity43 's ( left ) son @entity42 ( right ) , pictured as a nine - year - old , is hoping to follow his father at @entity46 @entity48 legend @entity31 ( right ) poses with his son @entity30 ( left ) , with whom he has had the opportunity to play @entity51 19 , @entity52 , son of @entity54 @entity55 , 19 , @entity56 - @entity57 @entity58 , 19 , @entity60 - @entity59 @entity61 , 19 , @entity62 - @entity63 @entity0 , 16 , @entity65 - @entity64 @entity5 , 15 , @entity67 - @entity66 @entity26 , 18 , @entity46 - @entity43 @entity30 , 19 , @entity68 - @entity31 @entity32 , 20 , @entity70 - @entity69 @entity27 , 19 , @entity46 - @entity71 @entity25 , 16 , @entity67 - @entity72 @entity37 , 19 and @entity73 , 16 both @entity35 - @entity10 if horse - racing superstar @entity75 is commanding £ 125,000 in stud fees , perhaps football clubs should consider paying a pre-birth premium for the offspring of the game 's best players			1
is it , then , genetics ? or is it nurture over nature ? @entity85 was enjoying a kickabout with his toddler , @entity87 , in an apartment in @entity46 when something struck him			1
' i suddenly realised he was left footed – which is rare - and he just loved kicking the ball , ' recalls the former @entity94 and @entity95 midfielder , who has seen his boy mature in to a @entity98 winger with @entity99			1
' i then saw how well he travelled with the ball and it all seemed natural – i thought , " he 's got a chance here "			1
' @entity59 's son , @entity104 , 19 , is on the books at @entity60 and has made the bench at senior level			1
the former @entity109 and @entity95 defender also knew from an early age his boy had the makings of a footballer			1
' i did n't think when he was born , " right , my son is going to be a footballer " , ' says the father of two			1
' but you do think there might be something in the genes which could transfer			2
' you keep an eye on them			2
you watch closely and there is a way that they move and address the ball			2
you think , " hold on , this looks a natural thing for him to do "			2
' but i 'm also a strong believer that it 's environmental			2
one of my sons is a footballer , the other is a journalist who knows everything about football – that 's the environment they 've been brought up in			1
' @entity85 ( left ) was a defensive midfielder but his son , @entity99 star @entity87 ( right ) is a tricky winger reading youngster @entity58 ( right ) is a commanding central defender like his father @entity142 ( left ) @entity57 's son , @entity143 , is a 19 - year - old midfielder who made his debut for @entity56 in august			2
the @entity146 manager agrees with @entity59 that an immersion in football helps shape character and mindset			2
' i think he has got a chance and this is why – it is because he lives , sleeps , eats and breathes football , ' says @entity57			2
' he does n't care about anything else other than football			2
like his dad ! he is always thinking about playing			1
' @entity57 , though , decided against taking @entity143 with him to @entity161 and instead advised him to join the @entity56 from @entity162 during the summer			2
@entity163 , meanwhile , has twice signed son @entity164 for @entity165 and @entity99			2
likewise , @entity85 managed @entity87 at @entity166 and @entity167			2
but @entity57 said : ' i would love to coach him , but at the same time it would be unfair on him			2
' do you think the players on the bench would accept it if i 'm playing my son ? @entity56 is a great opportunity			1
' @entity56 's @entity55 ( right ) is looking to emulate his father , @entity146 boss @entity176 ( left ) former @entity177 striker @entity54 ( left ) and his son @entity51 ( right ) , who is also a striker @entity59 's son is a centre back , and a no - nonsense one at that			0
@entity0 's boy , 16 , is a diminutive playmaker with a wand of a left boot			0
he plays for @entity65 – the @entity185 - in @entity186 , a club founded in 2009 and owned by his famous father			1
@entity5 's son scores goals and @entity72 's is a goalkeeper , both in the @entity67 academy			0
@entity31 's boy , meanwhile , recently scored a spectacular overhead - kick having first taken control of the ball on his chest , much like his dad once did for @entity9 to complete his hat - trick in a 3 - 2 win over @entity201 in 2001			1
@entity10 's eldest , 19 - year - old midfielder @entity14 , has trained with the @entity35 first team and is easy on the eye			1
there is , however , the odd player who deviates from the father - like - son narrative			0
@entity210 was a combative midfielder , @entity209 is a pacey wideman			0
' i think it 's easier for @entity213 that he has his own identity , ' he says			0
' not many people draw comparison between myself and @entity213 any more , because he is so different as a player			0
' although i 'll tell you a secret - when i was younger i used to dribble around three or four and put it in the top corner as well ! i used to score 40 goals a season but @entity56 made me a midfielder who got it and passed it			0
so i do take some credit ! ' @entity5 ( centre ) , son of @entity17 , is working his way through @entity67 's famous academy system @entity5 chats with then @entity230 manager @entity229 during his stint as assistant manager @entity72 ( left ) also has his son and fellow goalkeeper @entity233 ( right ) in @entity67 's academy van der @entity236 dives to make a save during his dad 's testimonial match in @entity240 in 2011 a young @entity233 poses with his dad and the @entity243 trophy after @entity177 's win in may 2008 so how much of a part does senior play in the development of junior ? ' we had an area set out at our old house where i could work with him on certain things , ' reveals @entity59			1
' i see a lot of me in there			0
but now he has to want it for himself			0
the next step is making your own decisions and being your own player			0
' there has been an explosion of pushy parents in an age where the financial rewards of making it pro are life - changing			0
but what about the former players ? @entity59 and @entity57 differ , whereas @entity85 plays good cop and bad cop			1
' i am his biggest critic			0
i am terrible , ' admits @entity57			0
' i do not look at what he does well , but what he does badly			0
' @entity62 's @entity61 , son of @entity278 midfielder @entity63 , came through the ranks at @entity177 @entity59 counters : ' i only ever shout " well done "			0
i 'm a strong believer in allowing the kids to play and parents should know their place			0
as a former footballer i also have to step back and know my place			0
' i had the other side with my own dad			1
if i scored five goals , he would say i should have scored six			0
' @entity85 adds : ' it was so easy for @entity213 when he was very young that i just used to let him enjoy it			0
then when it got serious , at about 16 , i started having a right go at him – right in his face			0
' when i managed him it was difficult to get that balance between father and son , i 'd be harsh on him and he 'd say things back he would n't to another manager			0
@entity29 great @entity69 in his pomp , beating @entity302 goalkeeper @entity301 to score in the 1997 @entity303			1
the match , played in @entity305 , was a 3 - 3 thriller @entity63 ( left ) celebrates with @entity307 after scoring a goal for @entity309 against @entity310 in 1993 ' but now we 'll sit down and go through the dvd and talk about things			0
i think that 's the best way			0
' @entity85 , of course , is still some way from emulating the achievements of his father , as are @entity0 , @entity5 and @entity10			1
but if they ever do , it wo n't just be @entity23 we 'll be watching them on .			0
