by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 - seeking tourists on the @entity5 island of @entity6 are getting more than they bargained for on the beach			1
alongside middle - aged men in unsightly @entity11 and the obligatory lobster - coloured @entity12 , visitors to the island have been shocked to see a seal languishing on sun loungers or frolicking in the waves			0
while monk seals normally choose quiet caves and peaceful coves as resting sites , this seal - named ‘ @entity28 ’ by local fishermen - prefers the company of humans and has chosen a spot on some of the most bustling beaches on the island , even upgrading herself to a sunbed , on occasion			1
however @entity28 ’s sociable nature made this impossible , and the @entity37 team and its volunteers is therefore using @entity28 ’s presence to raise awareness of the endangered species and the conservation work they are undertaking to protect it			2
the team hope @entity28 will return to her natural habitat of her own accord , but in the meantime , they are on hand to advise visitors to the beach on how to behave around @entity57 as a means of protecting her			0
any efforts to minimise @entity28 's contact with humans has been scarped by her sociable nature the team hope @entity28 , who is one of only 450 monk seals , will return to her natural habitat of her own accord efforts to minimise human contact have involved close collaboration with an extensive network of volunteers from the local community including fishermen , farmers , tourism professionals , students and teachers , as well as valuable assistance from the local port authorities			1
‘ the @entity37 will do everything it can to ensure the protection of @entity57			0
this seal has served as an excellent ambassador for her species and reminds us that , as in ancient @entity5 , all wildlife – particularly seals and dolphins – can coexist in harmony with humans , ’ says @entity37 director , @entity79 .			0

a seal has been *enjoying* the beach next to tourists in @entity6 , @entity5
the monk seal has been named @entity28 by local fishermen
*displaying* *highly* *unusual* *behaviour* for the usually *shy* species
there are only 450 monk seals left in the wild
has even been *basking* on the sun loungers
despite attempts to tempt her back to the wild , @entity28 seems to prefer human company
is being protected by @entity37 and team of volunteers
