this is the poignant moment when a man rescued from the hell he endured at the hands of the @entity4 met his saviour and gave him a salute almost 70 years later			1
@entity8 first saluted his rescuer @entity9			1
then he kissed his hand and finally , he fell to his feet , exclaiming : ' i have wanted to do this for 70 years			0
i love you , i love you so much ... '			1
@entity15 , now 87 , was a ' walking corpse ' on april 29 1945 when @entity17 soldier @entity9 , 89 , marched in with his comrades to liberate the charnel house that was the @entity21 concentration camp near @entity22			1
@entity9 , a machine gunner with the 42nd ' @entity24 , ' moved to block 11 of the infamous complex which was the first camp built by the @entity4 to house its enemies in 1933			1
@entity15 kissed the hand of his rescuer and said : ' i have wanted to do this for 70 years			1
i love you , i love you so much ' thank you : a clearly overwhelmed @entity15 fell at @entity9 's feet in gratitude when the two men were reunited in @entity44 for a television documentary by the time it was liberated more than 35,000 people had been murdered there - in executions , in cruel medical experiments , starved , worked and beaten to death			1
the first person he saw was @entity15			1
he was hiding in the latrines with other prisoners , uncertain if the soldiers who arrived were liberators or a @entity29 death squad sent to liquidate the camp			1
' we were confined to barracks by the guards			0
this meant most of us were marked for death , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' then i saw the white flag flying from the watchtower and i realised then that the torture was at an end			0
when the @entity32 smashed in the door , my heart did somersaults			1
' @entity9 helped the emaciated prisoner into the daylight and back into the land of the living			1
both parted with tears in their eyes - both believed they would never see one another again			0
then and now : a youthful @entity8 is pictured ( left ) before he was condemned to @entity21 concentration camp , and ( right ) as he is at the age of 87 today hero : @entity32 soldier @entity9 pictured ( left ) as a soldier and ( right ) as he is at the age of 87 today my hero : @entity88 thanks @entity9 for saving his life			1
recalling the moment he realised the camp had been liberated , @entity15 said : ' when the @entity32 smashed in the door , my heart did somersaults ' @entity21 , near @entity22 in @entity95 , was the first concentration camp set up by the @entity4 in 1933			1
it was opened by @entity98 , one of @entity100 's most trusted commanders			2
more than 35,000 prisoners died there before it was liberated by @entity32 forces on april 29 , 1945			1
after liberation , the camp was used by the @entity17 as an internment camp			2
it was also the site of the @entity109 , for @entity95 war criminals , between november 1945 and august 1948			0
in 2013 , @entity111 made history when she became the first @entity95 chancellor to visit the former concentration camp , where she expressed " shame " at the crimes of the @entity29 regime			2
the infamous wrought iron sign reading ' @entity119 ' - which means ' work makes you free ' was stolen from the camp 's gates in november 2014			1
@entity15 , who lost most of his family in the holocaust , made it to @entity128 where he became a soldier who fought in the @entity131 and the @entity132			1
he later emigrated to @entity32 where he married , fathered three daughters and became a self employed plumber			2
@entity9 married , fathered eight children and built a career for himself as a successful salesman			2
amazingly , neither knew that they lived within an hour 's drive of each other until a @entity95 documentary crew arranged their moving reunion on the sand at @entity145 , @entity44			1
accompanied by his youngest daughter @entity146 , 34 , to the meeting , @entity8 said : ' i came out of hell into the light			2
for that , and to him , i am eternally grateful			0
' @entity9 , who had fought with his comrades through @entity153 to reach the gates of the @entity21 camp , said : ' it was the most profound shock of my life			1
its liberation changed my life forever			0
' we could not understand it			0
i grew up in @entity44 where we had everything in abundance			2
' we did n't get how people could let other people starve			0
they murdered them or just let them die			0
again and again the questions moved through my head			0
and at the same time i was just incredibly angry			0
' gates to hell : the entrance to the @entity21 concentration camp , where more than 35,000 people are believed to have died , bearing the infamous @entity29 slogan ' @entity119 ' which meands ' work makes you free ' torment : pain is etched on the faces of prisoners inside @entity21 in a picture believed to have been taken on the day the camp was liberated by @entity32 forces when they were reunited , @entity9 asked @entity15 : ' how did you survive ? what kept you alive ? ' an emotional and overwhelmed @entity15 replied : ' @entity188 would have been easier			1
in @entity21 we had to tote around 50 kilo cement sacks			2
' whoever broke down was immediately shot			0
i turned me into an animal			0
and animals want to survive			0
' he described how , to this day , he still sleeps on a thin mattress close to a window so he can gaze out at green grass every day			0
the meeting , and their stories , will be told in a special for the @entity203 to be screened on may 31			0
@entity15 had the last word on the beach when he said : ' i have everything i wanted in life through him			2
that is the reason for my thankfulness			0
' both men are old , both realise they will probably never see one another again			0
but both said they were humbled by their meeting so many years after @entity216 was crushed			0
captive : prisoners peer out from behind a barbed wire fence as they await rescue after the liberation of @entity21			2
built in 1933 , it was the first of the concentration camps built by the @entity29 regime			0

emotional reunion between @entity8 and rescuer @entity9
pair salute one as they are reunited on @entity230 , @entity44
@entity15 was a ' walking corpse ' when rescued from death camp @entity21
now 87 , he told @entity32 soldier @entity9 : ' i love you so much '
the men lived only one hour 's drive from each other ... but neither knew
