by @entity0 too many children are still starting school without the basic skills they need to be able to learn , the head of @entity2 warned yesterday			1
sir @entity6 said that a ‘ significant minority ’ of youngsters across the country are ‘ simply not ready ’ for lessons			1
more than a third continue to struggle to do simple tasks such as count to ten , write simple words or take turns speaking in class amid a shortage of ‘ high quality ’ provision			0
falling behind : more than a third of five - year - olds are starting school without the ability to count to ten , write simple words or to speak aloud in class ( stock image ) around two - fifths of all early years settings such as nurseries and childminders – 5,361 – are ‘ not improving fast enough to give children the best start in life , including the skills they need to be ready for school ’			1
they have remained ‘ satisfactory ’ since the introduction of the @entity36 in 2008 which sets out what is expected of pre-school and reception children , according to @entity2 ’s report			2
last year , teachers warned that rising numbers of children were arriving at school still wearing nappies while others were struggling to speak properly			1
sir @entity6 yesterday insisted that ‘ satisfactory ’ provision was not effective enough to ‘ close the attainment gap sufficiently quickly ’			1
warning : @entity2 chief inspector sir @entity6 said that ' satisfactory ' provision is n't good enough to ' close the attainment gap sufficiently quickly ' the report – @entity52 – quotes 2012 @entity54 figures showing that 36 per cent of children start formal learning without a ‘ good level of development ’			1
children are supposed to be able to count reliably to ten , use language such as ‘ circle ’ or ‘ bigger ’ to describe shapes and sizes , interact with classmates and take turns to talk and show basic control of objects and tools by the time they start full - time school			2
but 34 per cent of five - year - olds do not have a good level of communication , language or literacy			0
among children from poorer areas , the figure rises to more than four in ten			0
fifteen per cent of five - year - old boys in @entity81 can not write their own name or short words like ‘ cat ’ or ‘ dog ’ , compared with eight per cent of girls			0
some eight per cent of boys can not count up to ten , compared with five per cent of @entity6 said the best nurseries and childminders ‘ ensure children are given clear routines and procedures that help build self - assurance ’			1
he added that ‘ their staff are highly skilled adults who improve the vocabulary , cognitive and social skills of very young children , particularly when they are not able to gain them at home ’			2
he published examples of childminders and nurseries that are managing to bring youngsters up to scratch using imaginative methods			0
a childminder in @entity109 uses a ‘ superhero skills school ’ to engage young boys in their learning			2
failing : two - fifths of all pre-school settings are ' not improving fast enough ' to give young children with the skills they need - leaving a ' significant minority ' unable to write their name or simple words such as ' cat ' or ' dog ' ( stock image ) at @entity127 children ’s centre , @entity122 , north @entity123 , adults and children come together for ‘ tea club ’ – an opportunity to evaluate the experiences of that day			1
@entity132 village hall pre-school in @entity133 encourages children to use money and real china cups			0
the @entity2 report says : ‘ in the snack area , children spend a very long time selecting their choices and paying for their order with real money			0
‘ as well as deciding when and what to eat , they are also learning about numbers and money in realistic situations			0
’ others placed a high value on training , with one sending staff on trips to countries as far as @entity154 and @entity155 to learn from the best nurseries .			0

sir @entity6 said a ' significant minority ' are ' not ready ' for lessons
