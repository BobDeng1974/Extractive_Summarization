such a tactic had already seen him left on the bench for @entity1 's @entity153 match against @entity154 in the @entity155 and that , combined with the delay in offering him an extension , resulted in the player coming to a decision about his future			1

that period between the summer and the end of november gave me thinking time			0
' there 's no blame and i 'm not angry about it			0
there are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about			0
' there is no finger pointing from me towards the manager or anyone else at the club			0
