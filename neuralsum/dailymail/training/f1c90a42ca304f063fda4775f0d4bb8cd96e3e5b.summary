by @entity0 published : 18:51 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 18:51 est , 7 january 2014 astronomers are to use the distorting effects of gravity in a distant galaxy cluster as a magnifying glass to peer closer at distant galaxies than has ever been possible before			1
this image taken by the @entity9 shows @entity10 , a distant region of space known as @entity10 , which is so massive that its gravity distorts space time around it			1
the distortion creates a range of odd optical effects ; but interestingly it also magnifies the light from even more far away objects hidden behind @entity10 , allowing astronomers to see them in better detail			1
@entity10 's cluster : the space time distortion around @entity10 , a massive galaxy cluster created by the collision of four previously separate clusters , is helping astronomers to peer deeper into the distant cosmos @entity10 is the product of the violent and simultaneous collision of four galaxy clusters over 350million years it was first spotted by @entity9 in 2011 , when observations of its weird and wonderful properties promped the nickname @entity10			1
this latest long - exposure image of the cluster shows a mix of hazy elliptical galaxies and colourful spirals clumped together in the centre , @entity36 explained in a statement			0
the effects of the powerful gravitational field can be seen in the blue arcs and distorted images scattered across the frame , that seem to be bleeding into the surrounding space			0
the arcs , @entity36 says , are in fact the distorted images of galaxies even further in the distance			0
@entity10 is the first of six targets for an observing programme known as @entity57 , a three - year operation to probe the deepest views of the @entity60 yet seen in visible light			1
it 's continuing mission : @entity10 is the first of six targets @entity9 will look at for a three - year observing programme known as @entity57 in order to do this , the @entity9 will exploit so - called gravitational lensing effects around its targets to peer beyond them into the unknown depths of the cosmos			1
a @entity36 spokesman explained : ' gravitational lensing is a phenomenon caused by an object 's influence on the space - time around it			1
' massive objects like galaxy clusters warp and distort this space - time			2
this causes light from more distant objects hidden behind this makeshift lens to be deflected and bent , leading to a bizarre array of optical effects — for example , it caused a cosmic space invader to appear around cluster @entity10 68 by creating mirror images of one galaxy , as well as smearing galaxies out into arcs , and creating multiple images of individual objects			2
' as well as creating these weird shapes , lensing also magnifies the images so that astronomers can see more detail			0
this means that distant objects that otherwise would be too distant and faint to be seen become visible — something that @entity57 aims to exploit over the coming years			0
' the programme is already beginning to bear fruit			0
in a paper submitted to @entity110 last november a group os astronomers told how they had detected a large number of possible galaxies through the gravitational lens of @entity10			2
they found that five of these galaxy candidates are part of distant systems that appeared to have been imaged multiple times due to the cluster 's gravitational effects			0
@entity36 's spokesman added : ' these deep surveys using massive galaxy clusters like @entity10 show that looking through cosmic lenses can be an effective and useful way to study the distant @entity60			0

the gravity around @entity10 is so strong it distorts space time
this allows astronomers to use it like a magnifying glass to see beyond
