the eerie howls that pierced the dense forest were not the usual wildlife sounds that the residents of @entity4 , @entity5 , were used to			1
then , in footage captured by a 12 - year - old boy , a large , dark , mysterious figure loped through the trees and across the path ahead			1
after viewing the two - minute video he decided to travel up to visit the boy who captured the footage - and even declared the clip the most convincing evidence of the mythical creature since the 1967 @entity28 - @entity27 video			1
he told @entity29 : ' i ’m not telling you that this is @entity18			2
i ’m telling you we either have a bunch of things that are lining up to be the most convincing evidence since the @entity28 - @entity27 video or this is a really amazing hoax			2
' mr @entity14 believed that his 12 - year - old informant was telling the truth			1
he said : ' this really terrified this kid			0
i ’ve done enough interviews with people who say they ’ve seen @entity18 to know … he was scared			2
it was almost frightening to watch him deal with it			0
' the @entity18 was supposedly using a track through the woods in @entity4 , @entity5 , pictured monster hunter @entity14 , closely examined several footprints , even measuring the length of the stride the video featured a tall gangly creature striding purposefully through a woodland clearing about 100 yards from the camera			1
before the action , there are a number of piercing cries from the woodland			0
mr @entity14 said that the area of @entity5 was believed to be a particular hotspot for @entity62			1
he said : ' we think these things migrate through this area , and we are on the edge of what could be a migration pattern			0
it ’s just getting cold , so these creatures are gon na be moving from way up from north where it gets snowy , down to the coast to go get some food			0
' during his visit to the area , mr @entity14 tried to recreate the movie , playing the part of @entity18 himself in a pair of brown dungarees , so he could measure the size of the mystery creature against himself from the same distance			1
but as he began to apply his years of monster - hunting experience - via the tv show @entity86 - to probe deeper into the evidence , a few things did not add up			2
mr @entity14 believes the footage is the most compelling since 1967 @entity28 - @entity27 video , pictured @entity14 , right , went to @entity4 and interviewed the 12 - year - old boy , left and his father , centre when mr @entity14 , left , was shown some ' @entity18 ' tracks outside the property he became more suspicious in a second section of video posted by mr @entity14 ( above ) , the youngster - whose name is not given - leads mr @entity14 to a location close to where the sighting was made and , unsurprisingly given the covering of snow on the ground , the mysterious @entity18 has left several large footprints in the snow			1
the doubts begin and in a third video on the sighting posted by mr @entity14 ( below ) , he analyses the evidence with a colleague , and suggests that the footprints he had been shown were perhaps a little too perfect			1
he tells his viewers : ' we basically took our time			0
our job as researchers is to research and that ’s what we did			0
we took our time and did n’t jump to any conclusions			0
' i am always going to be transparent			0
' mr @entity14 then tried to recreate the footage by walking along the same track , left , as the monster , right after examining the footprints , mr @entity14 is not entirely convinced that they belonged to a @entity18 then he drops a bombshell that the boy had told school mates he faked the whole thing			1
' i received a really strange phone call from a friend of the boy who filmed it , ' he tells his viewers			1
' this friend told his mom that his friend has faked this @entity18 footage and how he has faked all of us out			1
that upset me when i heard that			0
but he still appears to want to believe that the footage is genuine , saying : ' i still trust these people - i still believe they are being honest with me			2
i know the father is being honest with me at least			0
' we were told that his teachers and his peers from school were giving him such a hard time of being a witness to sasquatch that he felt threatened			2
he felt he was being picked on and being bullied			0
' despite the chance that the entire video was a hoax , mr @entity14 hopes that it may be genuine and said in future such bullying may prevent other @entity18 sightings from being made public			1
he added : ‘ this young man was bullied into saying what he videoed was faked			0
' a lot of people will not come forward and talk about what they have experienced because they fear that they will be ridiculed			0

' @entity164 ' @entity14 is impressed by footage of @entity18 in @entity5
the tv star traveled to @entity4 in @entity5 to meet a 12 - year - old eye witness
after measuring some of the footprints , mr @entity14 is *slightly* suspicious
a phone call to mr @entity14 suggests that there may be issues with the tape
