@entity0 is the city that never sleeps , but it appears @entity1 is the borough with the most night owls - not @entity3			0
that ’s according to a study of sleeping patterns across the @entity7 , which reveals what time different counties go to bed			0
by monitoring the patterns of more than a million people , detailed maps showing how long people sleep for have been created			2
the visualizations were created by principal data scientist dr @entity16 from @entity17 for @entity18			1
while the average night 's rest was below the recommended seven hours in every major @entity7 city , @entity0 reigns supreme when it comes to those burning the midnight oil			1
by borough , @entity1 stays up the latest with those in @entity26 going to bed around 12:07am every ' night '			0
@entity1 is followed by @entity3 ( 11:55pm ) , @entity28 ( 11:52pm ) , the @entity29 ( 11:47pm ) and @entity30 ( 11:46pm )			0
the results were based on data from over one million wearers of @entity44 fitness tracker			0
counties where there was not enough data were blended with nearby counties			0
the map also reveals how at the borders of different time zones sleep patterns are shaped by daylight			2
on the western extremes of time zones people go to bed later , presumably as they have more light until the sun sets			0
eastern extremes of time zones , meanwhile , see people go to bed earlier for the opposite reason			0
@entity62 makes a difference : the map revealed that those on the extreme western borders of time zones tend to go to bed earlier than those on the far eastern borders since daylight plays a role in circadian cycles ‘ unbeknownst to us , our body ’s circadian rhythms tune to sunlight hours , silently influencing you to go to bed when the sun goes down irrespective of the exact time , ’ @entity18 reports			1
a separate map reveals how many hours of sleep different counties of the @entity7 are getting			1
it shows that not many are getting eight hours a night , with many hovering around the seven - hour mark			1
residents of @entity0 got an average of 6.82 hours of sleep a night			1
people in @entity88 , @entity86 meanwhile managed to get 7.52 hours of sleep on average			1
they found that , in general , most city - dwellers did n't get the recommended seven hours of sleep per night , while most suburban and rural counties were			1
@entity18 says they are planning to perform similar of sleep patterns in finer detail around the world			2
up all night : residents in @entity1 , @entity0 stay up later than most anyone else in the @entity7 , average a 12:07am bedtime every night			2
above , a view of the @entity101 at dusk			0

maps *released* by the *bluetooth* *company* @entity18 show average bedtimes across the nation
another map also shows average hours of sleep each night , by county
@entity18 made the maps using data from *1million* users of their sleep app called ' up '
