at $ 60 million to send a satellite to orbit , one of the biggest challenges facing space exploration is cost			1
but the @entity7 military believes it has a solution ; use fighter jets instead of rockets to get satellites and probes off the ground			1
it says this will bring cost of launch down to just $ 1 million ( Â£ 650,000 ) , while cutting launch times from a few months to just a few hours			1
it shows how the fighter jet will begin a vertical ascension , holding onto the mini-rocket in what has been named the @entity31 ( @entity33 ) program			2
once it hits a certain height , the mini-rocket disconnects from the fighter jet , and begins to push to low - orbit with its payload			0

the second stage then ignites and the payload fairing falls away burning up in @entity44 's atmosphere			0

' we 've made good progress so far toward @entity73 's ambitious goal of propelling 100 - pound satellites into low @entity75 within 24 hours of call - up , all for less than $ 1 million per launch , ' said @entity79 , director of @entity20 's @entity80			1
' we 're moving ahead with rigorous testing of new technologies that we hope one day could enable revolutionary satellite launch systems that provide more affordable , routine and reliable access to space			2
' @entity20 is currently favouring the use of f - 15 planes that do not require modifications to carry out launches			2
launches of satellites by governments requires scheduling years in advance for the few available slots at the nation 's limited number of launch locations			2

the goal is to get a 100 - pound satellites into low @entity75 within 24 hours second stage ignites and the fairing falls away ( artist 's impression pictured ) burning up in @entity44 's atmosphere this slow , expensive process is causing a bottleneck in placing essential space assets in orbit			1
the current @entity33 design envisions launching a low - cost , expendable launch vehicle from conventional aircraft			1
serving as a reusable first stage , the plane would fly to high altitude and release the launch vehicle , which would carry the payload to the desired location			1
' @entity125 seeks to overcome the limitations of current launch systems by streamlining design and manufacturing and leveraging the flexibility and re-usability of an air - launched system , ' said @entity133 , program manager			1
' we envision an alternative to ride - sharing for satellites that enables satellite owners to launch payloads from any location into orbits of their choosing , on schedules of their choosing , on a launch vehicle designed specifically for small payloads			2

@entity20 says it is currently favouring the @entity156 perhaps the most daring technology @entity73 is attempted to create is a new high - energy monopropellant , which aims to combine fuel and oxidiser into a single liquid @entity20 is now working on designing commercial - grade avionics and composite structures			1
perhaps the most daring technology @entity73 is attempted to create is a new high - energy monopropellant , which aims to combine fuel and oxidiser into a single liquid			0
if successful , the monopropellant would allow simpler designs and reduced manufacturing and operation costs			0
@entity73 also aims to reduce infrastructure costs by using runways instead of fixed vertical launch sites , automating operations and avoiding unnecessary services			0
' small satellites in the @entity125 payload class represent the fastest - growing segment of the space launch market , ' @entity133 said			1
' @entity20 expects this growth trend to continue as small satellites become increasingly more capable			1
' current plans call for the first @entity125 launch late this year , with a total of 12 @entity125 launches planned through mid- 2016			1

@entity20 hopes to send satellites to space from a conventional runway
fighter jets will take and release mini-rockets high into the atmosphere
this will bring down the cost of launch from $ 60 million to just $ 1 million
the plan could also cut launch times from a few months to just hours
current plans call for the first test launch of the system late this year
