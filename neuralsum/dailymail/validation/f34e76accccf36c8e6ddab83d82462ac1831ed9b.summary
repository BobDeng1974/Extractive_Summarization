every transfer window , clubs scramble to pick up the best bargains , often leaving fans brimming with excitement over the latest big - money import			1
but , seven months after last summer 's window swung shut , which of those deals have proved to be the worst value for money ? as we reach the business end of the season , @entity11 takes a look at which summer signings have promised so much but offered so little for their respective clubs			2
10 - @entity18 @entity19 to @entity20 one of two @entity20 entries after a summer which saw @entity24 ’s side go backwards			1
@entity18 is one - paced , does n’t impose himself on games and is a man out of his depth , particularly in the @entity28			1
@entity19 must ’ve laughed all the way to the bank when losing @entity18 and @entity31			1
any better than @entity32 ? @entity11 ’s not so sure			0
@entity33 midfielder @entity18 has struggled to make an impact at @entity20 since his summer move @entity18 ( right ) looked out of his depth during @entity20 's @entity28 campaign @entity37 plus @entity39 duo @entity38 and @entity40 have all justified big money moves ... but who is your signing of the season ? 9 - @entity46 @entity47 to @entity48 who knew that a striker who spent most of his career in the lower divisions probably was n’t going to be cut out for life at @entity54 ? well , quite a few actually			1
but that did n’t stop @entity56 taking him from @entity47 for £ 4m last summer			2
perhaps at that price it was worth taking a punt on @entity46 but the former @entity62 frontman has had no tangible effect on the side and been reduced to becoming a glorified lump up front in the final moments if @entity48 are chasing a game			2
@entity46 's dream move to @entity48 has n't worked out the way he would have hoped @entity46 celebrates just his second @entity72 goal for @entity48 against @entity73 in january 8 - @entity75 @entity74 @entity76 to @entity77 this list is all relative			1
if you pay £ 60m for one of the world ’s superstars , there is a reasonable expectation that he wins you a few games ; but good performances of @entity87 ’s can be counted on one hand and he has n’t been able to get to grips with @entity91 football			0
@entity92 has quite rightly persisted with the former @entity76 man , although we have witnessed just why @entity95 was n’t overly fussed about him leaving the @entity96			0
former @entity76 star @entity97 ( right ) seems to have lost his way at @entity77 @entity87 is shown a red card by referee @entity100 during @entity77 's 2 - 1 @entity102 defeat by @entity103 7 - @entity104 free agent to @entity106 the epitome of everything that ’s been wrong at @entity106 during @entity110 ’s tricky second season in charge			1
on paper an excellent signing - particularly for free - but @entity104 ’s inability to drive forward from midfield has slowed @entity106 down			0
they 're not the most patient lot at @entity118 and he has been no stranger to the fans ’ ire			0
@entity106 midfielder @entity104 ( right ) has endured a tough season at @entity118 @entity104 is shown a red card for a late challenge on @entity124 during @entity39 's 1 - 0 victory against @entity106 6 - @entity126 @entity127 to @entity48 it just has n’t worked , has it ? @entity126 ’s difficulties at @entity54 have actually shone quite the light on how well @entity132 did in charge of the tempestuous striker at @entity20			1
the £ 16m fee sounded a snip at the time , but @entity56 has n’t been able to get anywhere near what ’s required			0
the @entity139 is a completely different player to that fearsome forward of @entity142			0
@entity126 has struggled for a first - team place after several poor performances for @entity48 the @entity139 striker has scored just four goals for @entity48 since his summer move from @entity127 5 - @entity148 @entity149 to @entity150 the prerequisite to any signing is that they ’re capable of buying into whatever ethos that club ’s manager has			1
in this case @entity157 makes his players do a bit of running			0
@entity148 does n’t do running			0
he clearly has the ability required to be a success in the division - the @entity162 was hugely impressive on his debut away at @entity167 - but he does n’t appear willing to work on his fitness			0
just ask @entity169 , who contemplated sending the forward back to the @entity150 after landing him on loan in january			0
@entity148 has made just 11 @entity72 appearances for @entity150 and @entity169 the @entity162 forward was hugely impressive on his debut away at @entity167 last august 4 - @entity176 @entity177 to @entity77 ( loan ) remember the fuss that was made when @entity77 swooped on deadline day for the @entity181 ? seems a long time ago now			1
it is absurd to think that @entity183 could even contemplate making the loan move permanent at the end of the season			1
just four goals for a man heralded as one of the best finishers in the business has meant @entity176 even got a run out for the under 21 side a few weeks ago			1
does not justify the astronomical wages @entity77 pay him			2
@entity181 striker @entity176 has endured a terrible season at @entity197 , scoring just four goals @entity199 boss @entity92 ( right ) looks likely to end @entity176 's loan spell at the end of the season 3 - @entity202 free agent to @entity169 another one for the @entity169 conveyor belt of wasted money			1
the club ’s transfer policy of bringing in ‘ experienced ’ professionals on high wages was perhaps unfortunate when they suffered relegation from the @entity72 two years ago , but this time it was downright foolish and has left them in serious financial trouble			0
even @entity213 of crouching on his haunches fame - is preferred to @entity202 , who has looked anything but match fit and failed the basics			2
that tells the whole story , and this looks to being a desperately sad way to end a stellar career			0
@entity202 has n't been able to find his feet during a relegation battle with @entity169 2 - @entity224 @entity19 to @entity20 @entity225			1
to think @entity20 paid £ 32m for the central defender beggars belief , and heads will undoubtedly role from a recruitment point of view			2
has n’t been helped by the continuing slide of @entity232 , but @entity31 is supposed to be a big imposing brute of an enforcer and there can be no excuses for a rank average first season in the @entity72			2
@entity224 ( left ) cost @entity24 's side £ 32million , but has failed to live up to the price @entity240 beats @entity31 for pace before scoring for @entity242 against @entity20 in october , 2014 1 - @entity243 @entity177 to @entity242 he did n’t come cheap , costing more than £ 5m from @entity177 , and for what ? poor misses , the inability to shake off markers and a source of constant frustration for supporters who want their team to attack with gumption			1
seventeen @entity72 games without a goal means @entity243 has the dubious honour of becoming @entity11 ’s worst signing of the 2014 - 15 season			0
a special mention must go to @entity260 as well , who ca n’t fulfill his duties as a professional footballer by virtue of never - ending injuries			0
but @entity243 pips the @entity266 for some downright disgusting displays			0
@entity243 ( centre ) has been a source of frustration at @entity271 this season @entity243 's only two @entity242 goals came during the 3 - 2 @entity274 victory against @entity167			2

@entity97 has failed to impress despite a bright start at @entity77
@entity126 has n't been able to live up to his £ *16million* price tag
@entity176 made a big - money loan move but has just four goals
