by @entity0 seeing the @entity1 from @entity2 is n’t easy			1
the football pitch - sized station orbits at a height of 260 miles ( 420km ) , appearing as small as a distant star when we gaze at the night sky			0
but photographer @entity9 has captured incredible images that show the station ’s silhouette crossing the moon during its orbit of @entity2			1
but compared to the moon , its just a stone ’s throw away			0
the moon is on average about 239,000 miles ( 384,000 kilometres ) from our planet , over 900 times further than the @entity1 in terms of size , the @entity1 is dwarfed again			1
the space station is 358 feet ( 109 metres ) wide , 239 feet ( 72.8 metres ) long and about 66 feet ( 20 metres ) high - the same as a standard football pitch			0
@entity9 was trying to photograph a so - called ' blood moon ' when he took these images			1
the striking red moon , which occurs relatively rarely , was most visible across @entity40			0
it looks red because @entity2 's atmosphere scatters the sun 's red light as the moon passes into our planet 's shadow , called the umbra			1
it 's the same process that makes the sky appear red at sunset			0
inside there is a pressurised liveable space comparable to a six - bedroom house			0
the moon , by comparison , has a radius of about 1,079 miles ( 1,737 kilometres ) - equivalent to 0.273 earths			2
considering these distances and sizes , the fact that we can see the @entity1 silhouetted against the moon is incredible			1
it ’s all the more stunning that we can make out some of its features			0
on either side of the silhouette you can see the vast solar arrays of the station - four on each side - that generate 84 kilowatts of power			2
and in the centre is the core of the station where the crew of up to six astronauts and cosmonauts reside			0
currently on board the @entity1 as members of @entity82 are three @entity85 cosmonauts , two @entity87 astronauts and one @entity89 astronaut , @entity88 , who is also serving as the first @entity89 commander of the station			2
the @entity1 might seem huge to us , but compared to the moon it 's just a tiny silhouette zoomed up close you can see a remarkable amount of detail on the football pitch - sized @entity1 , including the two huge solar arrays on either side this 23 may 2011 photo released by @entity101 shows the @entity1 above @entity2 , taken by @entity103 crew member @entity102 from the @entity104 following its undocking			1

photographer @entity9 snapped these incredible shots *yesterday*
he was trying to get a photo of the so - called ' blood moon ' from @entity20
but instead he found the @entity1 in his images
the tiny silhouette of the @entity1 can be seen against the *enormity* of the moon
