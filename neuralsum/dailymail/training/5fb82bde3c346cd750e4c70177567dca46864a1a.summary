an @entity2 evangelist may be coming to a bar near you			0
on a call outlining its strategy to get people to sign up for @entity2 over the summer , leading @entity2 advocacy group @entity8 said it will get more creative with its outreach tactics – including hitting up night clubs – now that only certain groups of people remain eligible to sign up for health coverage			1
' if it 's a health fair , we wan na have a table set up			0
if it 's a long line at a night club , we want somebody walking up and down it , talking to folks while they 're stuck there , ' @entity19 , @entity20 , told fellow @entity2 recruiters on the call			2
the group will begin its new outreach operation in may			0
pro-obamacare group @entity8 says it will hit up night clubs , like the one in this file photo , next month to look for people without health insurance open enrollment into @entity2 closed on march 31			1
among those now eligible for special enrollment are young people aging off of their parents ' insurance plans			1
under the new rules , insurance companies are required to provide coverage for policyholders ' dependents until age 26			0
@entity48 , a youth focused @entity50 group , estimates that 11,500 @entity51 will turn 26 each day between now and november when the open enrollment period begins anew			1
that 's 2.6 million young people , according to a recent @entity48 report , based on data from the @entity57 , concludes			2
there 's a ' little bit of a " @entity62 ? " component ' to identifying people who fall into this category , @entity58 director @entity19 said on last week 's call			0
but @entity8 thinks it 's figured out a few good places to find and recruit these non-traditional enrollees , including night clubs , court houses and @entity71 drug stores			1
' if it 's a long line at a night club , we want somebody walking up and down it , talking to folks while they 're stuck there , ' @entity19 , @entity20 , told fellow @entity2 recruiters on a call ' we want to go to wherever people are and engage them on their terms , ' @entity19 said			1
the ' terms ' on which @entity84 could find itself with young people waiting in line at the club when it comes around to lecture them on their health care options might not be good			2
young people - who may already be intoxicated - may not be predisposed to discuss serious issues like their health care coverage while they 're trying to have a fun evening out with friends			2
@entity8 did not return a request for further comment on its outreach efforts			0
' @entity2 " youth outreach " tactics seem to get funnier as time goes on			0
now they plan to ask young people in line at clubs to fork over thousands of dollars for a government program designed to rob us ? ' said @entity107 , a spokeswoman for youth advocacy organization @entity108 , in an email to @entity110			2
' thinking about it though , it makes sense that they would n’t waste their time marketing to us while we ’re sober			0
' best known for its ' @entity119 ' ads that feature the government mascot looming over young people during sensitive doctor - patient discussions about their health , ' gen @entity117 ' has been encouraging young people to ' @entity125 ' of @entity2			1
the group 's most effective tactic for signing young people to opt out has been holding college tailgate parties			1
the group told @entity130 in 2013 that it would consider reaching out to young people at events like concerts during warm weather			0
@entity8 listed court houses as another place it would target for @entity2 outreach			1
among those who qualify to sign up for @entity2 outside of the normal enrollment process are people who were recently released from jail and people getting married or divorced - all of whom would have to visit a court house			2
a location the group said its had success signing people up in the past that it plans to continue recruiting people from is @entity71 , as seen here at an @entity8 event at a @entity71 in @entity152 @entity153 , director of enroll @entity84 's @entity154 , reminded listeners on the call of the importance of keeping enrollment numbers up throughout the rest of the year			1
' it wo n't be a very great headline if we get 8 million people connected to coverage , and we do n't keep most of those folks connected to coverage a year from now or seven or eight months from now , ' she said			0
a location the group said its had success signing people up in the past that it will continue recruiting people from ahead of the open enrollment period that begins in november is @entity71 , where it sets up tables on free health screening days			1
city dwellers looking to avoid @entity2 recruiters need not avoid @entity71 for the foreseeable future , though			0
@entity71 will not hold any more free screenings until a date to be determined this fall .			0

@entity8 is a leading @entity183 group
it 's key focus is recruiting people to sign up for health coverage
the open enrollment period for @entity2 is now closed , but certain groups of people , including convicts and young people aging off their parents ' insurance , can still apply for health insurance coverage
@entity8 's @entity20 said it would begin hitting up night clubs and court houses to look for people who fall into that category
