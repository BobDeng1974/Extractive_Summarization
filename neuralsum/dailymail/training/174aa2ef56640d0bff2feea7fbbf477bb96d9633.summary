@entity1 assistant manager @entity0 believes @entity2 could be a future club captain but in the short term he may just have to settle with assuming @entity5 's midfield role			1
@entity5 is awaiting results of a scan on a hamstring problem which could keep him sidelined for a fortnight and with @entity11 already out for between four and six weeks with a thigh problem , the side are looking light in central midfield			2
can , who arrived from @entity16 in the summer as a midfielder but has adapted to defensive role in a back three , stepped in briefly in midweek when @entity5 went off in the win over @entity20			1
@entity1 assistant manager @entity0 believes @entity2 could be a future club captain can arrived from @entity16 in the summer as a midfielder but has adapted to play in defence vice-captain @entity23 and @entity25 are the only two fit senior central midfielders with can another option , although his success in defence may mean @entity30 is reluctant to move him			1
asked whether @entity2 's calmness under pressure and quality on the ball makes him a potential future captain @entity0 said : ' he is young , he is learning his game , but in years to come i am sure he will progress to be one of them			1
' he is a leader on the pitch and the way he is playing he has been fantastic			2
' but at the moment he himself is probably not even looking at that sort of thing			0
' on the possibility of can being restored to @entity47 added : ' when we were monitoring him to come into @entity1 he could play at centre - half but the opportunity arose for him to go into a back three - where he has been fantastic			1
can has impressed since taking his role in a back three and is likely to be kept there by @entity30 the @entity1 player looks relaxed during a training session at @entity56 on thursday afternoon ' but you could see the other night when he stepped into midfield he does want to play there , it is his position , and he is a great asset			1
' he is a great lad and a good player			0
he has n't moaned about anything or knocked on the manager 's door , he has waited for his chance and grabbed it with both hands			1
' if @entity2 had to go into midfield there is another possibility but with @entity23 and @entity25 there we have enough cover			1
' with @entity76 scoring his first @entity78 goal to win the match against @entity20 there is renewed hope the @entity81 international will be able to make something of a so - far disappointing career at @entity84			0
can celebrates with his team - mates after they beat @entity20 3 - 2 at @entity84 in their @entity78 clash fellow summer signing @entity76 scored his first goal for the club during the win against @entity20 the problem he has is @entity92 is back to full fitness and in the current 3 - 4 - 3 system there is really only room for one out - and - out striker			2
however , @entity0 admits the goal has not done @entity76 any harm			2
he comes in every day , works hard			0
he is one of those guys who when he is out there he wants to work well , ' said the assistant boss , standing in for manager @entity30 who was returning from @entity81 on player - related business			2
' it was great for him the other night when he got his goal			0
' it is not about one player , it is about the group , and the next game with all the players available			0
' he has put himself out there for selection for the next game with his contribution the other night			0
' every team is picked for certain occasions			0
@entity76 probably does need a run of games but @entity92 had come back in as well and all strikers need a run of games			0
