i do not have a problem with giving second chances to disgraced athletes			2
redemption stories can provide some of the most uplifting moments in sport and in the past few years i have come to admire @entity7 , a man who will always be known as a drugs cheat , for the way he responded to his downfall			1
third chances are a little more difficult to wrestle with			2
recidivism suggests a predilection for cheating the public and one ’s fellow competitors that is harder to forgive and which makes it more troublesome to believe that the athlete has reformed			2
sprinter @entity21 signed a lucrative sponsorship contract with @entity23 this week @entity21 has twice been convicted of using performance enhancing drugs @entity21 's deal with @entity23 has been met with some unfavourable responses from key figures in athletics what i really have a problem with , though , is rewarding an athlete who has cheated twice with a big , fat sponsorship deal			1
what i really have a problem with is somehow legitimising the taking of performance - enhancing drugs in sport by making a cheat look cool			1
that ’s what @entity23 have done			1
that ’s the message they have sent out by giving a new sportswear deal to twice - convicted drugs cheat @entity21 in the build - up to this year ’s @entity48 in @entity49			1
@entity23 do n’t do shame			1
but they should be ashamed of themselves for this			2
they should be ashamed of the message they are sending out at a time when athletics desperately needs its stance on @entity60 to be unequivocal			2
they make it their business to make their athletes appear cool , too			2
they turn them into people their youth - orientated customers want to emulate			2
and now they are going to do that with @entity69 sprinter @entity21 who , in the absence of @entity71 , ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the world last year			1
cheats do prosper after all then			2
let ’s remind ourselves about @entity21			1
he was first banned for taking performance - enhancing drugs in 2001 after testing positive for amphetamines			1
@entity21 claimed he had been taking medication for @entity80			1
his two - year ban was reduced			2
he won gold in the 100m at the @entity84 in @entity85			2
then , in 2006 , he tested positive again			2
his then coach , @entity87 , blamed a massage therapist for rubbing cream laced with testosterone into @entity21 ’s buttocks without his knowledge			1
it was ‘ the - dog - ate - my - homework ’ stuff			2
@entity21 was banned for eight years this time , a punishment subsequently cut in half			1
@entity21 won gold in the 100m at the @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity98 @entity21 is now 32 but despite his age , is posting some of the fastest times on his career that should have been enough to put him out of the range of endorsement deals for the rest of his career			1
but it ’s not enough for @entity23 , apparently , even though they did drop @entity21 after his second positive test			1
they even seem a little surprised that anyone ’s bothered			2
‘ earlier in his career , ’ @entity110 , @entity23 ’s vice president of communications for @entity111 told @entity112 , ‘ @entity21 served the ban that was imposed on him and has been competing again for almost five years			1
’ here ’s another thing			2
here ’s the thing that @entity23 do n’t say			1
here ’s the thing that makes what they are doing even more cynical , even more pathetic			0
@entity21 is 32 now , a little old for a sprinter , but for some reason , he is managing to run even faster than he was when he was taking performance - enhancing drugs in his prime			1
@entity23 still seem to think it ’s worth making @entity21 one of the faces of their brand			1
they ’re desperate , i suppose			0
@entity71 , the man seen as the saviour of athletics , runs with a @entity131 on his chest			0
@entity23 are taking a hell of a beating so they ’re gambling on a two - times drug cheat to get them back in the game			1
even @entity138 , a fellow @entity23 athlete , sounded appalled			1
‘ i am very disappointed to hear this news , ’ wrote @entity138			1
‘ i do n’t believe it truly reflects the core values of the @entity23 i am proud to represent , nor the integrity and ideals of the people there that i work with on a daily basis			1
’ @entity138 , who is also sponsored by @entity23 , revealed her dismay at the news of @entity21 's deal last year , @entity21 ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the absence of @entity71 to talk about @entity23 ’s integrity and ideals is rather generous			1
the deal with @entity21 reinforces the idea that @entity23 ’s integrity begins and ends with making money			1
their ideals ? please , do n’t make me laugh			0
if @entity23 really had any ideals that extended beyond maximising market share , they would not have gone anywhere near @entity21			1
it would have known that in the wake of the @entity168 doping scandal that afflicted athletics last year and added to the cumulative effect of so many previous scandals , the most powerful groups in the sport needed to take a strong stance			0
@entity23 have done the opposite of that			1
they have caved in to commercial pressure			0
they have bowed to greed			0
in the grim struggle against drugs in athletics , this is @entity23 ’s contribution : just blew it			1
ten days ago , rookie linebacker @entity182 quit the @entity183 at the age of 24 and turned his back on a multi-million dollar contract			0
he had started thinking about leaving the @entity187 after getting his ‘ bell rung ’ and suffering another minor concussion			0
he did some research , read about the @entity187 veterans suffering from dementia , and decided it was time to get out			0
‘ i just honestly want to do what ’s best for my health , ’ @entity182 told @entity195			0
‘ from what i ’ve researched and what i ’ve experienced , i do n’t think it ’s worth the risk ... i ’m concerned that if you wait until you have symptoms , it ’s too late			0
’ @entity182 quit the @entity183 at the age of 24 , believing it was best for his health @entity207 was knocked out for the third time in six weeks playing for @entity209 on friday @entity210 ( third right ) lies motionless after being knocked out as @entity212 lost to @entity213 in the @entity214 i thought about @entity182 yesterday morning when i read that @entity207 had been knocked out again following a blow to the head during @entity209 ’s victory over @entity219 on friday			0
six weeks ago , @entity210 appeared to be knocked out twice in the course of @entity212 ’ @entity214 defeat to @entity213 at the @entity222			0
that ’s some serious damage to his head in a very short space of time			0
i wonder if he knows @entity182 ’s story and if he ever thinks about getting out before it ’s too late ? some of @entity232 ’s most enthusiastic and dedicated followers have become so desperate to proclaim him the best there has ever been that they have started to claim triumphs for him where they do not exist			0
the little genius of @entity238 has won the @entity239 twice but say that to some and they become disproportionately outraged by what they interpret as a vicious calumny			0
this kind of disproportionate outrage , of course , is the lingua franca of social media but it does not change my opinion that you are not entitled to say you have won the @entity239 or the @entity239 unless you played in the final			0
@entity232 has played in and won two @entity239 finals in 2009 and 2011 for @entity238 @entity232 ( left ) scored a header for @entity238 in the 2009 final against @entity254 @entity232 won the competition with @entity238 in 2009 and 2011 but missed the 2006 quarters , semis and final through injury			0
that means he has won it twice			0
his furious supporters claim that because he played in previous rounds , he is counted as a winner in 2006 , too			0
because we live in inclusive times , the @entity238 and @entity265 websites back up that up			0
however , @entity268 does not feel he deserved to be called a @entity239 winner when he missed the final in 1999			0
i understand @entity272 feels the same			0
@entity273 played in the final when @entity254 beat @entity275 that year but also appeared in a quarter - final the season @entity254 beat @entity278 in @entity279			0
@entity232 is not considered a three - time @entity239 winner as he missed @entity238 's 2006 final @entity232 ( left ) celebrates winning the @entity239 in 2011 for @entity238 at @entity282 he travelled in the squad to @entity279 but did not make the final 18			1
@entity273 does not consider that he has won the @entity239 twice			0
perhaps the final word should go to @entity232			0
‘ i feel a champion of @entity290 much more than i feel a champion of @entity265 , ’ he told @entity285 in his book , @entity238 , at the end of the 2005 - 06 season			0
