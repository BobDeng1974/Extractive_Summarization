within a few weeks she became inundated with calls from greyhound owners wanting her to take the dogs off their hands and so set up the @entity86 dog rescue , which is run entirely from her home			2
she says was then asked to work undercover for a @entity89 documentary to ' expose the dark side of grey hound racing , ' and was horrified to see greyhounds drugged with heroine and living in squalor			0

but i do it because you see these sad cases and when you manage to turn it around it is so worth it			0
