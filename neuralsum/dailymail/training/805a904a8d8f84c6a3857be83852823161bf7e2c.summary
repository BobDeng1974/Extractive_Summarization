@entity0 and @entity1 were quietly going over a scene from the new musical @entity3 before a rehearsal			1
out of the corner of my eye i saw cast member @entity5 suddenly loom over them with a club , and proceed to pretend to beat them			2
it ’s a moment of racial ugliness in @entity3 , which won a @entity14 for best musical on @entity16 four years ago , that shocks to the core			1
‘ the first time i did that scene , i must say i felt pretty sick inside , ’ said @entity0 , who plays would - be singer @entity21 , ‘ that people did that to each other , with no sense of guilt or shame			1
’ @entity0 stars as aspiring singer @entity21 in new musical @entity3 , set in segregated @entity28 the show is set in segregated @entity28 and focuses on @entity30 , a white dj , played by @entity1 , who introduces the ‘ devil ’s music ’ ( rhythm and blues — or any music with a pulse ) to the ‘ white folks ’ in the @entity32 and early @entity33			1
@entity30 is loosely based on the late dj @entity40 , who launched @entity41 on his audience with a delivery like an express train			2
the reason for the beating in the show is that @entity30 and @entity21 are dating			1
‘ black and white romance was illegal then , ’ @entity1 said			2
@entity0 said she had visited @entity3			1
‘ segregation is over , but they still preserve the whites - only water fountain — and the blacks - only one			2
’ the singer was a sensation in the musical @entity56 before taking on @entity3 , created by @entity57 , @entity58 and director @entity59			1
the show is set in segregated @entity28 and focuses on @entity30 , a white dj , played by @entity1 ( left ) , who introduces the ‘ devil ’s music ' the original songs and energy of the cast are exciting			1
i had some misgivings when i saw the show in @entity69 , but it has been worked on since then			1
@entity1 and @entity0 make an electrifying duo			1
he has a special routine to protect his voice , and has been contracted to do seven out of eight performances each week			2
she will do six and drinks lashings of @entity76 , a black sweet @entity78 tea , to keep her voice in tip - top condition for when previews start at the @entity82 on october 9			2
@entity83 ca n't wait to be the @entity85 singer oh ! @entity86 ! actress @entity87 has been chosen to give voice to @entity89 in the @entity90			1

@entity87 has been chosen to give voice to @entity119 singer @entity89 in the @entity90 songs written by @entity89 , @entity112 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 are woven around a story that eventually makes @entity89 the heroine of an edgy drama			1
and there ’s not a number in @entity92 that you wo n’t know			2
@entity87 has appeared in straight plays and musicals before and is a casting coup for the part			1
she plays the piano and cello , and writes and performs her own compositions			1
her parents are folk and blues singers @entity139 and @entity141 , so there was always music in the family , what with her sister @entity146 being a folk singer , too			1
‘ i ’ve never known a project where i say : “ i love that song ! i love that song			2
and that one ! ” @entity87 said , as we went through the @entity89 catalogue , which encompasses hits such as @entity151			0
‘ she ’s such a wonderful songwriter , and the numbers have these beautiful melodies			0
they speak to people , ’ @entity87 said			0

at that time , the producers had n’t decided whether to bring over @entity161 , who created the role on @entity16			1
but @entity163 and @entity164 , two of the main producers , told me that finally , they and director @entity168 decided to find an actress here			0
‘ it ’s a star - making role , ’ @entity163 explained — a view i share			0

‘ we have to know how to kill the zombies , ’ she said			0

she joins the cast on set today , with director @entity232 overseeing the mayhem			1
@entity211 , 22 , already knows how to box , and her father , a black belt , let her attend the karate classes he gave at a leisure centre when she was younger			0
