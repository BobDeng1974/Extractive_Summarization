by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 01:47 est , 25 september 2012 it appears all @entity2 has to do to boost ratings of his @entity5 version of @entity6 is appear on it himself for just a few minutes			1
sunday night 's @entity9 show was the most watched programme in @entity11 that day ... and even notched up audience viewers to make it the second highest ratings of the series so far			1
and it seems it could have been the addition of @entity2 back on screens as he made a ( very small ) comeback			1
he 'll be happy ! @entity2 is all smiles as he momentarily appears back on sunday 's @entity6 ... causing viewing figures to be given a boost the music mogul has n't been seen on @entity11 's @entity6 since he quit two years ago			1
but on sunday he must have pleased fans of the show as he made a return ... although not on the judging panel as some would perhaps like			1
he instead appeared looking relaxed as he phoned the current panellists , consisting of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , from the comfort of sunny @entity33 during a break from filming the @entity36 version of the talent programme			2
that 's better : sunday 's show averaged at 9.4 million viewers , with it at 10.8 million at its highest - the second highest rating of the season so far @entity2 was seen smiling as he delivered news to the judges about which group of acts they would be mentoring and taking care of on this year 's series			1
and as a result an average of 9.4 million viewers , including those tuned into @entity54 and @entity55 , while it peaked at 10.8 million viewers at one stage			2
although it still failed to draw in the numbers it did from last season			2
meanwhile , @entity62 on @entity54 averaged around 8.4 million viewers , although that did mean it was down from the previous week 's ratings and form its popularity a year ago			2
it managed to notch up an average of 8.6 million viewers in its debut episode for the new series the week before			2
the girls ! @entity31 was seen squealing with delight as @entity2 informed her she 'd be taking care of the females , consisting of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity76 and @entity78 the ratings statistics come as the final 24 @entity6 contestants going through to the live show part of the programme have been revealed			1
during sunday 's episode @entity31 , who is the reigning judge from last year , was seen jumping around with joy after the mogul informed her she would be looking after the females			2
she gushed : ' get in there			2
thank you very much @entity2 , i wo n’t let you down			0
' she added : ' before , i said to myself there is no way i can win two years in a row , never going to happen			0
but my category is so strong that it ’s actually possible			0
' @entity31 's group includes 16 - year - old @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity76 and @entity78 , who all wowed the judges with their vocal ability , originality and personality			1
the boys : @entity28 will be mentoring @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity76 @entity30 was given the over 28 's , @entity28 took the boys while @entity29 was handed the groups			0
the @entity110 singer and writer seemed pleased with the mature group of singers and said : ' oh wow			0
brilliant ! that is good news to my ears			0
' ' i feel like in recent years , the overs has become a bit of a joke category and i really want to restore what the overs should be this year			0
there are people over 28 with talent ! ’ the over- 28s : @entity30 will be working with @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity76 , @entity76 , @entity128 and @entity129 @entity30 will be working with @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity76 , @entity76 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
@entity28 had expressed that she wanted the girl category but after being given the boys she said : ' i was n’t expecting that			0
' the groups : @entity76 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity139 will be taken care of by @entity141 manager @entity29 overs : @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity126 , @entity76 , @entity76 boys : @entity76 , @entity105 , @entity76 , @entity102 , @entity101 , @entity103 girls : @entity75 , @entity78 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity76 , @entity76 groups : @entity137 , @entity146 ( formally @entity147 ) , @entity76 , @entity76 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity76 the former @entity149 singer will be mentoring @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity76			1
@entity29 , who managed @entity141 and @entity150 got the groups - a category he was n't prepared for			0
he said : ' i got the groups			0
i was n’t expecting the groups			0
i ’m going to work hard , and yeah , it ’s going to be great			0
' when the judges deliberated over the groups they told five acts they had made it through before asking two bands to battle it out for the final place			1
@entity76 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity139 all landed spots at the next stage of the competition but @entity30 told @entity135 and @entity147 that they must battle it out in a sing off			1
but diehard fans will know @entity139 failed to make it to judges houses after member @entity171 , 23,who was born in @entity173 , submitted his application for leave to remain in the @entity5 which is being viewed by the @entity176 , but he left it too late and was unable to head to the judges ' houses abroad			1
he was told he would not be able to re-enter the @entity5			0
upset : @entity179 were axed from @entity6 after one member failed to secure a visa and there was more changes as @entity146 and @entity76 were added to @entity185 ' category while @entity146 added to @entity146 and the group was renamed @entity147 @entity29 sad : ' when @entity139 left , i found it difficult to choose between two groups to fill their place			1
in the end i invited boyband @entity147 to come to @entity192 , but still felt that as i ’d lost such a strong group in @entity139 that i wanted to make sure the category was the best it could possibly be			1
' i asked @entity30 , @entity28 and @entity31 if they minded if i took a seventh act			0
they were happy as they felt they ’d got the right six acts for their @entity202 trips so i asked @entity76 to come along and they said yes			0
' she 's happy ! @entity31 was ecstatic when it was revealed to her by @entity2 that she 'd be in charge of the girls this year to attempt to continue her reign as champion judge they 'll do ! she originally wanted the girls but @entity28 was happy to accept taking charge of the boys category			1

but it was all change from *bootcamp* to judges houses as @entity139 left the competition after visa issues
@entity146 renamed @entity147 after one new member was brought in by @entity222
