by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 2 april 2012 a mother who went into labour at just 22 weeks has revealed her joy today after her son won his desperate fight for life			1
@entity7 , 34 , was pregnant with twins when her waters broke 18 weeks early			1
she was told her babies had a zero chance of survival and soon after lost her daughter @entity13			1
however , the mother from the @entity15 managed to delay giving birth to her son @entity17 for three weeks by lying with her feet elevated in a hospital bed			1
her precious son was born at just over 24weeks weighing a tiny 1lb			2
in the palm of your hand : @entity17 needed an operation to fix a hole in his heart survivor : @entity28 with mother @entity7 and father @entity29 after they brought him home from hospital			1
sadly @entity17 's twin sister did not survive her premature birth mrs @entity7 said : ' i wanted to do whatever i could to become i mum			1
so i got into the bed , lay down , and did n’t move			0
' i was told it was almost certain that i was going to lose him			0
i think if i had n’t done that i would not have the beautiful baby that i have today			0
' the mother gave birth to @entity13 at @entity43 in the @entity15 , after staying still for two weeks but she only survived only 19 hours			1
@entity7 was transferred in her bed by ferry to @entity46 , @entity47 where there is a specialist neo-natal unit and seven days later @entity50 was born			0
doctors rushed @entity17 , who weighed less than a bag of sugar out of the maternity ward and put him straight onto a ventilator			2
surgeons performed several operations on @entity17 - fixing a hole in his heart and correcting @entity61 - an eye condition which can cause babies to go blind			1
it meant @entity7 and husband @entity29 , 40 , from @entity65 , @entity15 , were unable to hug their newborn for the first five weeks of his life			0
but @entity17 survived against the odds and at six months old is showing no ill - effects of his dramatic arrival into the world			1
precious : @entity7 had to wait five weeks before she could hug her son new life : @entity17 at just a day old at @entity46 in @entity47 although @entity17 weighed just 1lb at birth amazingly he is not the lightest baby to have survived - that record goes to @entity79 who was born in the @entity80 weighing 8.4oz			1
the lightest baby to survive in the @entity81 was @entity82 who weighed just 10oz when she was born in 1938			0
the second lightest was @entity84 who was born weighing 12.5oz in 2007			0
mrs @entity7 said : ' when i finally got to hold him it was the best moment of my life			0
' i know i have lost a child but i feel like the luckiest woman in the world at the moment			0
' mr @entity28 added : ' it was the most stressful three weeks we have ever experienced and the last few months have also been tough			2
' it may have been hell getting here but we are so happy to have come through it all with a healthy , beautiful boy			0
' consultant obstetrician @entity100 , who treated @entity7 at @entity43 ’s , said : ' survival below 24 weeks is very rare			2
' i have nothing but admiration for their strength and courage , never giving up hope			0
' perhaps the strongest character was young @entity17 himself			2

@entity112 's waters broke at just 22 weeks and she was told son had zero chance of survival after losing twin sister
@entity17 is now six - months - old showing no ill - effects of his early birth
