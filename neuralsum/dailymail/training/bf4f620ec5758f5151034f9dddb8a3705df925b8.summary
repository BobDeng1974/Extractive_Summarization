by @entity0 it may be too late to make the @entity3 squad for this year ’s @entity4 , but a new smart football could get you in shape for the next one			0
built - in sensors in the @entity9 monitor how hard it is struck , tracks flight trajectories and reveals impact points for penalties and corners			1
it syncs with the firm ’s micoach app via @entity18 , and helps players learn and master various kicking and control skills			1
it syncs with the firm 's micoach app via @entity18 and helps players learn and master various kicking and control skills professor @entity30 has produced a mathematical formula to guarantee @entity3 success at this summer ’s @entity4 in @entity33 - and also on how to take the ‘ perfect penalty ’			1
the @entity36 physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat , the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper @entity3 's chances			2
he added @entity3 's chances of success could be worked out by examining ‘ environmental , physiological , psychological , political and tactical variables ’			0
and said ‘ statistically @entity3 's red kit is more successful and we should play 4 - 3 - 3 rather than 4 - 4 - 2			0
' for example , the data is used to teach users how to bend free kicks , take better penalties , generate more power , and avoid injury			1
each time the ball is kicked , the app reveals the speed , amount of spin , which foot kicked the ball and its flight path			1
the £ 250 ( $ 299 / € 299 ) ball is on sale now in the @entity65 and @entity66 from @entity9 and @entity68 stores and comes with a wireless charger			1
elsewhere on the @entity72 app , the dedicated training section features tutorials to help master more advanced techniques , including the ‘ knuckleball ’			0
knuckleball is a technique developed by baseball player @entity79			0
@entity79 ’s method involved holding the ball between his knuckles with the intention of avoiding the rotational spin created by throwing a ball normally			2
each time the ball is kicked , the data is fed back to the app. the left - hand screenshot reveals the speed , amount of spin , which foot kicked the ball and its flight path			1
the dedicated training section , pictured right , features tutorials to help players master more advanced techniques he found that if the ball is not rotating , its trajectory is more likely to be affected by the airflow over the undulations of the ball 's stitching , making it move in the air			2
@entity107 to football , by hitting the so - called ' sweetspot ' of the ball , just above the equator with a big toe , the player can produce a shot which reaches its maximum height , before dipping sharply			2
it ’s a technique used by @entity115 and @entity116 among others			0
the micoach ’s @entity119 section , challenges players to kick the ball a certain speed , bend around a wall or try to replicate professional - level free kicks			1
there is also a record book section to save and record all kicks to improve and track performance over time			0

the @entity143 syncs to the @entity9 micoach app via @entity18
built - in sensors monitor how hard the ball is struck and tracks flight paths
it also reveals impact points and *detects* ball spin for penalties and corners
this data is used to train players how to bend free kicks , for example
the £ 250 ( $ 299 / € 299 ) ball is available now in the @entity65 and @entity66
