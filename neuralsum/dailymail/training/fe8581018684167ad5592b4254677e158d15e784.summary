by @entity0 , crime reporter published : 16:49 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 18:21 est , 31 march 2013 police officers are pocketing more than £ 20million a year in personal injury claims			1
they are instructing ‘ ambulance - chasing ’ lawyers to sue over mishaps on duty such as slips , trips and animal attacks			2
officers are being encouraged to make the claims by a hotline run by the @entity13			1
much of the £ 42million paid out over the past two years is taxpayer - funded			1
@entity15 @entity14 , left , is suing burglary victim @entity16 , right , after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage , pictured , while investigating a break - in solicitor 's letter in a case that has caused uproar , a policewoman is suing the man who dialled 999 to report a burglary because she tripped over a kerbstone at his property			1
@entity14 , 33 , is seeking a five - figure sum for injuries to her leg and wrist last august			1
she was well enough however to carry on the search for the suspected intruder			0
@entity16 , the garage owner who made the 999 call , said : ‘ how can anyone feel safe calling the cops if they size you up for compensation while they ’re fighting crime ? ‘ surely policing has elements of both public service and risk			1
is n’t that what officers sign up for when they put on the uniform – chasing villains and keeping us safe ? ’ recalling the incident , the 50 - year - old businessman said : ‘ i thought nothing of it – other than she must have been a bit embarrassed – and i helped her up			2
then we carried on with the search			0
’ @entity58 , chairman of the @entity60 home affairs committee , demanded urgent @entity62 guidelines on the issue			1
‘ this civil claim will have huge implications for every citizen if they call police out to their premises to help them in an emergency , ’ said the @entity65 mp			0
‘ it is in the public interest to know where exactly people stand in circumstances like this			0
if there are going to be cases like this , then people will feel reluctant to call the police in case they are sued			0
‘ i do not think in such circumstances the public would feel they had a responsibility for health and safety issues , in the middle of the night while apparently facing danger			0
‘ it ’s a bizarre case and we need some urgent guidelines from the @entity62			1
’ @entity96 has hired a @entity98 firm to sue mr @entity16 , claiming he failed to keep her safe as she investigated the suspected break - in at the @entity100 ’ @entity102 service station in @entity103 , @entity95 was in hiding at her parents ’ home in @entity103 yesterday			1
the mother - of - two , who is divorced from a police officer , declined to comment and suggested that reporters dial 101 , the police non-emergency number			2
she took the legal action without informing her employers at @entity114 and is now on sick leave over an unrelated medical condition which requires an operation			0
her claim makes 11 allegations against mr @entity16 including that he failed to turn the lights on or warn her of the kerb			1
the officer said she injured her left leg and her right wrist in the fall , although she was well enough to continue the search at the time			0
mr @entity16 is accused of failing to ensure the officer was ‘ reasonably safe ’ and of failing to ‘ carry out an adequate risk assessment ’			2
@entity96 tripped while investigating the break in at the @entity131 in @entity103 , @entity132			0
owner @entity16 said it is example of the ' fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident ' the legal letter , from @entity139 solicitors , concluded that the 999 call - out exposed the officer to an ‘ unnecessary risk of injury ’			1
but the garage owner said : ‘ if an officer can now sue you because they ’ve tripped over on your property what does that mean for the average homeowner ? ‘ if you hear a burglar downstairs , do you have to nail down your stair carpet , close the windows and put the lights on before you dial 999 ? ‘ this is the health and safety culture at work , the fallacy that someone is to blame for any and every accident and that compensation is free			2
’ the @entity13 , which represents 131,000 frontline officers , said the safety of its members came second to public service			1
however it actively promotes the claims hotline on its website , which links its members to personal injury lawyers			2
the service is open to officers and their families to claim for injuries on or off duty at no cost to themselves			2
applicants can choose from a ‘ menu ’ of claims including accidents at work , animal attacks , professional negligence , public liability and slipping and tripping			2
@entity58 , left , chairman of the @entity60 home affairs committee , has demanded urgent @entity62 guidelines while @entity132 mp @entity186 , right , said the @entity103 case was unacceptable these are passed to a specialist personal injury lawyer who fights their case at no cost to the officer whatsoever			1
many potential claims appear to be aimed at officers suing their employer over issues such as defective equipment or training accidents			1
the firm behind the scheme says it aims to ‘ maximise compensation ’ for officers			0
@entity132 mp @entity186 said the @entity103 case was unacceptable , adding : ‘ i think most people would regard it as quite bizarre that an officer acting in the course of their duties would pursue a claim against a member of the public who has legitimately called them out			0
‘ it is preposterous to imagine that it is appropriate ; it is the police doing the job they are employed to do			0
’ @entity218 , of @entity219 , said @entity96 ’s claim was forwarded to lawyers , regardless of the organisation ’s views			0
he said : ‘ all members of the public , regardless of what profession , can claim litigation against people and against private firms - that ’s why everyone has insurance			0
‘ it ’s not common , i appreciate that , but the claim has come in and we ’ve honoured the officer ’s wishes by putting it through to the solicitor			0
’ the national @entity13 said the vast majority of claims made through its helpline would be for road accidents and are not necessarily linked to police work			1
a spokesman said : ‘ police officers undertake their duties with public protection as their top priority , with the potential risk to themselves as a secondary consideration , if at all			0
‘ however , on occasion private prosecutions and civil claims are made by police officers - and they must be treated each on their own merits			1
‘ we share the public view that policing is a job that carries with it a reasonable amount of risk , at times much higher than that			0
