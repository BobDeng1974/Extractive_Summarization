by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:11 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 08:37 est , 4 february 2013 @entity3 divisions over plans to allow same - sex marriage took an extraordinary turn yesterday when a leading gay conservative said @entity8 who are secretly homosexual will vote against the legislation tomorrow			1
@entity10 even claimed that two married mps who are opposing gay unions are secretly cheating on their wives with other men			1
the talk radio host and former @entity3 parliamentary candidate warned that the issue has become so divisive that around 12 @entity3 , @entity19 and @entity18 risk being ‘ outed ’ if they vote against the plans			1
@entity22 claim : a leading gay conservative said mps who are secretly homosexual will vote against the legislation tomorrow the claims electrified an already bitter fight over @entity29 ’s proposals , which are set to see more than half of @entity3 mps oppose the prime minister ’s stance in the @entity34 tomorrow			1
@entity35 expects 120 @entity3 mps to vote no , with another 60 abstentions – a bitter blow to mr @entity29 who has pushed through the plans in the face of widespread opposition from his party			1
@entity3 cabinet ministers @entity44 , the environment secretary , and welsh secretary @entity46 are expected to vote no , while others are set to dodge the vote			0
the new archbishop of @entity50 is ready to challenge government plans for gay weddings , insisting marriage should be between a man and a woman			1
the @entity57 @entity56 , who is being formally confirmed in his new role at a ceremony in @entity60 today , is prepared to face questions about the highly divisive issue			1
‘ he will say that marriage is between a man and a woman , and always has been , ’ a source told the @entity64			1
@entity68 was keen to stress the view was standard @entity71 policy and insisted the @entity49 was not planning to wade into the row by making any formal statements , but was simply ready to respond to any questions he was asked on the issue			1
defence secretary @entity76 , a known opponent of gay marriage , will be overseas , although aides say the trip was long planned			1
allies of work and pensions secretary @entity80 say he has not made up his mind , but could now back the plans out of loyalty to mr @entity29			0
but with the party divided down the middle , mr @entity10 issued the incendiary allegation that some mps risk a charge of hypocrisy if they oppose the plans			1
having studied a list of those expected to vote no drawn up by pro-gay marriage group the @entity94 , he wrote : ‘ i note with interest the names of several mps who most people in the @entity99 know to be closet case gays			1
‘ and i note also the names of two supposedly straight mps who i know to be conducting gay affairs at the moment			1
’ mr @entity10 , who helped run @entity105 ’s @entity3 leadership campaign in 2005 , emphasised : ‘ i do n’t believe in ‘ ‘ outing ’ ’ anyone			1
’ but he warned : ‘ because of the rank hypocrisy there will be others who will take a different view			0
' how is it possible to be married yourself , and yet at the same time vote to deny that privilege to someone whose pants you have just pulled down ? ’ with feelings running high , 25 serving and former conservative constituency chairmen yesterday delivered a letter to @entity35 accusing the pm of ‘ bulldozing through ’ the reforms and warning they could cost him victory in 2015			1
the grassroots leaders say the decision to promote the @entity134 ‘ has been made without adequate debate or consultation with either the membership of the @entity3 or with the country at large ’			0
the letter argues that mr @entity29 has ‘ no mandate ’ for the change and has pressed his case ‘ in a manner which a significant proportion of @entity3 members find extremely distasteful and contrary to the principles of both the party and the best traditions of our democracy ’			2
but @entity3 mp sir @entity147 dismissed the significance of the letter , claiming arguments against gay marriage ' do n't add up '			1
twenty - five past and present officers went to @entity35			2
twenty - five out of 2,000 , 3,000 does not strike me as being newsworthy , ' he told the @entity155 4 today programme			2
' when it was first proposed i was indifferent			0
then a bunch of people started arguments against it			0
i started looking at those arguments ; they do n't add up			0
' conservatives believe in fairness			0
we now understand that to move from a civil partnership to a civil marriage is to allow the words " i will " at the ceremony			2
that is not going to be a big deal			0
' @entity10 has been in civil partnership since 2008 @entity10 is one of the most prominent gay @entity174 and a well - known figure at @entity178 talk show host is a presenter with @entity180 , the @entity181 radio station that hosts @entity183 ’s weekly phone - in show			1

mr @entity10 has been in a relationship with publishing finance expert @entity204 for 17 years , and in a civil partnership since 2008			2
he says they have n’t discussed whether to marry if the law is changed			0

some 49 per cent believe those who support traditional marriage will be persecuted at work for their views			0
protection : @entity223 insisted teachers would not face the sack for supporting gay marriage in schools the @entity228 , which opposes plans to redefine traditional marriage , released figures showing that 40,000 teachers might face the sack for failing to support gay marriage in schools			2
education secretary @entity223 – a supporter of same - sex weddings – insisted that they would be protected			1
‘ i have complete confidence in the protection our law offers freedom of conscience and speech , ’ he said			0
‘ there is a significant difference between expecting a teacher to explain something and requiring them to promote it			0
’ but a legal opinion , seen by the @entity250 , written by @entity251 says that teachers would have to promote gay marriage			2
he said the @entity134 ‘ provides no exception for conscientious beliefs			0
there would be a duty on the teacher to promote marriage as newly defined ’			0
one source said mr @entity223 was ‘ privately more concerned than he is letting on ’			0
