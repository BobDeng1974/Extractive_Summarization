the @entity8 peer has accused them of linking him to sex abuse at a @entity14 children 's home and then spreading the malicious rumour online after a botched @entity17 investigation			2
speaker 's wife @entity2 , comedian davies and @entity20 columnist @entity19 are on @entity24 's list of 20 , his spokesman confirmed , because the former @entity8 treasurer believes they helped destroy his reputation			1
pursued : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) are two of 20 ' high - profile ' tweeters being pursued for damages by @entity5 battles : many have apologised to the @entity8 peer but his legal team has said that people have destroyed his reputation they are currently using someone with more than 500 @entity38 followers as meeting their ' high profile ' definition , the spokesman added			1

they must apologise and agree to pay a nominal sum as requested to @entity50 , believed to be £ 5			0
@entity5 was accused after a shambolic @entity52 report led to his name being spread around the internet as a child abuser , which was completely untrue			2
@entity17 had not named him but referred to a senior conservative from the @entity58 era , leading to his identification online			0
mistake : @entity2 took to @entity38 to comment on speculation as to the identity of the @entity8 at the centre of a @entity17 investigation and could be sued i 'm sorry : mr @entity3 told his 444,000 followers on @entity38 that he had written to @entity5 to apologise mrs @entity2 then wrote : ‘ why is @entity5 trending ? * innocent face *			1
’ but she has defended her tweet , describing it as not libellous - ‘ just foolish ’ , has apologised and has now deleted her @entity38 account			0
@entity69 and @entity70 had tweeted : ‘ any clues as to who the @entity8 paedophile is ? ’ and then retweeted a response naming @entity5			2
he then told his 444,000 followers this week : ‘ i 've just written to @entity5 to apologise for retweeting his name in relation to false allegations following a @entity52 investigation			2
’ meanwhile @entity80 tweeted : " i looked up @entity5 on t'internet			0
it says the strangest things			0
" @entity80 later apologised on his blog admitting his deep regret over what happened			0
but despite the apologies , they all appear to be being pursued and @entity5 's spokesman admitted the list could increase			1
@entity5 has already agreed a £ 185,000 deal with the @entity52 and a £ 125,000 package with @entity93 after this morning presenter @entity94 accidentally flashed a list of alleged paedophiles to camera before handing it to the bemused prime minister			1
@entity100 , the peer 's lawyer , reiterated yesterday they would look for damages from people who defamed his client on @entity38			0
this was the extraordinary moment @entity94 handed a list of alleged paedophiles to @entity109 and eventually coast @entity93 £ 125,000 @entity52 controversy : @entity5 is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after @entity52 's @entity17 broadcast the wrong claims ' i think most importantly we get an apology and an undertaking not to repeat and once we 've examined the extent of the damage they 've done , we 'll agree suitable damages , ' mr @entity100 said			1
' some of them we 're aware of , some of them have come forward and some have been very apologetic			0
you know all of this will be borne in mind , in the same way that @entity93 were apologetic , as were the @entity52			2
