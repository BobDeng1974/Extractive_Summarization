he had all this power and money yet he was the weakest man i have ever met			2

but i could tell it was more that he was scared of her			0
’ miss @entity1 ’s affair with @entity2 began in january 2002 a month after they first met at a party			1
she said : ‘ i never took a penny from @entity2 during our time together — i even insisted on buying my own plane ticket when we went to @entity88 together			1
yet @entity36 has accepted money from @entity2 throughout their entire relationship			1
‘ she should be thanking me			0
before news of our affair broke she was just the @entity40 girlfriend of @entity2			1
mr @entity2 and @entity94 stayed together after the revelations but separated in 2006 ‘ when it hit the headlines , @entity36 was suddenly famous			1
and she used that to her advantage			0
she ’d have never been on @entity99 if it was n’t for me			0

‘ after that , @entity1 and i met when we could			1
not daily , but now and then			0
it got to be more and more serious			0
‘ @entity36 did not suspect anything			0
she was travelling to @entity40 a lot during that time			0
once , @entity121 and i went to @entity88 for a few days			0

’ mr @entity2 , now a football coach in @entity138 , said he did not feel he had anything to apologise for and claimed he received a positive reaction from the public			2
