when developers started planning a solar farm in a picturesque village , perhaps they should have found out who lived there first			1
because then they ’d have realised one of its residents fronts a band with ‘ rebel ’ in the name … so there was always going to be trouble			2
@entity14 , of 1970s rock group @entity10 , has joined his fellow villagers to protest against plans to cover 40 acres of land in the @entity18 with solar panels			1
the unspoiled area was the subject of paintings by @entity23 and @entity24			1
' it will ruin a beautiful part of our heritage ' : @entity14 at the proposed site of the solar power plant which will cover these fields near the village of @entity33 , @entity34 , where he has lived for the past 25 years under the plan , 25,000 panels surrounded by a security fence will be built in a field on the edge of @entity33 in @entity34			1
@entity14 , 62 , who made his name with hits including @entity43 ) , has lived in the village for 25 years			1
he said : ‘ it is a shockingly ugly plan that will ruin a beautiful part of our heritage			0
‘ it wo n’t create any jobs , it wo n’t benefit the village in any way at all and we fear that this will be the first of many similar applications for solar farms here			2
‘ we live among green fields of grass , yellow fields of corn and blue fields of flax			0
these massive and monstrous fields of glass and alloy are unthinkable to those of us who love the countryside			0
‘ solar panels belong on brownfield sites and roof - tops – not on the fields of the @entity18 , an area painted by @entity23 and @entity24			1
’ hey day : @entity71 , 62 , made his name with hits including @entity43 ) the developers claim the solar panels , which would provide power for up to 1,700 homes , will be mostly hidden from view			1
but residents who object to the scheme say the panels will be clearly visible for miles around			2
@entity83 , chairman of @entity84 and @entity33 parish council , said : ‘ we fear these things might escalate – there is already talk of plans for even larger solar farms next door to this site			2
' they will have a massive impact on this community and could open the floodgates , and we will strongly resist all such schemes			0
’ planning notice : @entity99 has applied for permission , which is still under consideration ' a shockingly ugly plan ' : @entity71 claims the plant wo n't create any jobs , wo n't benefit the village in any way at all and said locals fear that it will be the first of many similar applications for solar farms in the area the village of @entity84 : residents who object to the scheme say panels will be visible for miles around local resident @entity117 said : ‘ we have one of the best unspoilt medieval landscapes in @entity119 which has been documented and to compromise it would set a depressing and irreversible precedent			1
’ @entity99 has applied for planning permission for the development , which is under consideration			0
@entity125 , a chartered surveyor at the firm , said : ‘ following a generally positive response from the community we submitted our application to the council once we had ticked all the boxes			0
' we understand residents ’ concerns about cumulative impact but they are unfounded			0
‘ we spent a lot of money preparing our landscape and visual impact assessment survey which covers all angles on that impact but if we have missed anything then the planning officer will ask us to carry out more			0
