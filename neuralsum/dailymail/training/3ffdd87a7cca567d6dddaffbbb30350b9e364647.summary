@entity13 revealed his coaching crib sheet to photographers in @entity30 on wednesday			0
on one side of the @entity21 coach ’s notes , you can make out the instructions from a training session			1
‘ when the ball goes into control zone — team must make at least 3 passes before hitting the @entity5 [ centre forward ]			0
‘ once the ball is played into the end zone — 2 @entity7 [ midfielders ] try to get in and support for a 3v2			0
‘ however , if the defending team win the ball back they counter straight away			0

quick penetration is very much the style in the @entity84 but it comes with risk			0
@entity16 will protect the ball and the last thing @entity25 will want is for his players to spend 90 minutes chasing the ball in @entity90 , where the humidity will be crippling			2
‘ two midfielders in support ’ hints at an @entity21 midfield three , which would match @entity16 ’s central trio of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , because @entity25 would not encourage two to chase on and support in attack if they were only a midfield pair			1
that would leave no anchorman			0
‘ counter attack ’ will be the order to drop in and regroup quickly , because almost every team will seek to destroy with a swift break at the turnover of possession			2
@entity13 later tweeted : ' my curtains have been closed permanently for the duration of this tournament ! haha			0
