@entity35 are also twice as likely as the average to want to move to the @entity94 - a probable reflection of higher earning potential combined with lifestyle considerations making it a short - term move			2
lifestyle benefits , a lower cost of living and better wages make @entity2 consider emigrating mr @entity31 added : ' those considering a move overseas should also make sure they do their financial homework properly , particularly with regard to a potential new home 's cost of living , exchange rate and tax laws			1
