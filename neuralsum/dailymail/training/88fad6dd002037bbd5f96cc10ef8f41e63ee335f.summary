the ' license to kill ' was sold by the @entity13 in conjunction with the @entity16 government , as a minister from the @entity19 country was said to be jumping up and down in elation at the result because the funds go to conservation efforts in the country			1
the identity of the buyer has not been officially confirmed but another hunter has named @entity1 as the suspected winner			1
' well , i was willing to go $ 340,000 for the black rhino , but @entity1 went $ 350,000 and won the bid ! plus there was another $ 100,000 donation ! ! @entity13 and their supporters came through in a huge way for conservation again tonight ! ! ' hunter @entity36 posted on @entity37			1
calls to the @entity13 were not immediately returned			0
mr @entity1 is an active hunter who arranges shooting trips around the globe , and regularly posts updates of pictures on his @entity37 profile of himself with clients and the dead animals that they kill			1
the hacktivist group @entity48 has now become involved in the debate and launched a virtual attack - which they have named as @entity51 - on hunters involved with the auction			2
' unspeakable and terrible things happen every second of every day while the whole planet is forced to watch , as these cold hearted soulless zombies cause horrific suffering and death to animals , both common , vulnerable and critically endangered species , ' they said in a manifesto			2
mr @entity1 , a married father of two young daughters , is a part of the @entity65 and his company biography boasts that he has worked in the hunting tourism industry for more than a decade			2
endangered : an estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild , down from 70,000 in the 1960s ' @entity1 has hunted widely on 6 continents taking more than 120 species , including a @entity74 of wild sheep and the big five in @entity19			1
he lists conservation as one of his major interests , which stays in line with the @entity13 's claims that the sale of the license helps protect the endangered species by focusing on the killing of specific , older and arguably more aggressive beasts			2
the animal that is listed as the target involved with this weekend 's sale is @entity91 , an older bull rhino who can no longer breed			2
club spokesman @entity94 told the @entity95 that the animal was likely becoming a threat to other wildlife as he is getting more aggressive in his old age			2

the @entity13 sale , which has been condemned by environmental groups , was offering the chance to shoot the rare beast as a way to raise funds for the species ' conservation			0
while there were protesters at the event and animal rights groups have regularly spoken out against the sales of hunting licenses , the organizers were more upset that they did n't raise more money - as they were originally hoping to reach the million - dollar mark			2
' it annoys me to tears , ' said @entity126 , who runs a safari company in @entity16			2
' i was so angry last night			0
a million dollars would have lasted years , years in the conservation efforts ... the fact is it could have been more — it could have been a lot more , ' he told the @entity95			0
the @entity13 hopes to raise money in order to conserve the rhino in @entity16 a beautiful series of giraffe art is on view and available for sale at the @entity13 expo in @entity7 after complaints and protests about the sale , the @entity140 said earlier this week that it was investigating death threats against members of the club			1
about 40 protesters held signs and chanted outside the convention center where the auction and dinner took place			0
@entity153 and @entity154 traveled from @entity155 to join the protest after their children @entity159 , 12 , and @entity160 , 11 , asked if they could campaign			0

the @entity13 has adopted a new definition of the ideal hunt - able male @entity19 lion as well as the rhino ' there 's less than 5,000 black rhinos left on the planet and if our kids ever want to see a rhino left in the wild , we ca n't be pulling the trigger on every one we say is too old to breed , ' mr @entity174 said			1
@entity159 , executive director of the @entity13 , defended the auction			0
he said all money raised will go toward rhino conservation efforts			0
he also said the rhino that the winner will hunt is old , male and non breeding — and that the animal was likely to be targeted for removal anyway because it was becoming aggressive and threatening other wildlife			1
mr @entity159 added that wildlife experts say culling a herd is an acceptable habitat management practice			1
' in most cases , this animal is detrimental , ' mr @entity159 said			0
' he 's past his prime			0
' but critics have questioned that logic			0
officials from the @entity200 and the @entity201 have said that while culling can be appropriate in abundant animal populations , all black rhinos should be protected , given their endangered status			1
critics have also said any hunting of a rhino sends a bad message to the public			0
this auction is telling the world that an @entity212 will pay anything to kill their species , ' @entity211 , @entity212 regional director of the @entity213 - based @entity201 , said earlier this week			0
' this is , in fact , making a spectacle of killing an endangered species			0
