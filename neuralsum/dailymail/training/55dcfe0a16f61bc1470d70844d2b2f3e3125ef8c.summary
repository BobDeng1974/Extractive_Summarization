these starkly - beautiful images bring to light the subterranean conditions endured by soldiers of the @entity3 while they were sheltering from constant artillery fire			1
even though the fear of death always hung over the men - or perhaps because of it - the soft stone of the carved - out walls are covered in personal expressions of identity and survival			1
the stills were taken by @entity16 photographer @entity15 , who chronicled the tunnels in @entity18 alongside @entity20 writer @entity19			1
mr @entity19 wrote : ' the entrance is a wet hole in the earth little bigger than an animal burrow , obscured by thorny brush in a secluded wood in northeastern @entity18			1
together we slither through the muddy hole into the darkness below			2
' after a few hundred feet the tunnel ends at a little cubicle hewed out of the chalk , reminiscent of a telephone booth			2
these include names , addresses , religious and patriotic symbols , and other images			2
abandoned : some quarries could shelter thousands of men and featured amenities such as electric light			2
by 1918 combined tank , artillery , and air attacks made battlefields more mobile , and armies began to abandon their underground redoubts			1
he added : ' here , shortly after the outbreak of the @entity3 , @entity56 military engineers would take turns sitting in total silence , listening intently for the slightest sound of enemy tunnelers			1
muffled voices or the scraping of shovels meant that a hostile mining team might be only yards away , digging an attack tunnel straight toward you			2
' the danger grew if the digging stopped and you heard the sound of bags or cans being quietly stacked , one on top of another			2
it signaled that the enemy was laying high explosives at the end of the tunnel			0
most nerve - racking of all was the silence that followed			0
' at any moment the charges might detonate and blow you apart or bury you alive			0
' even a single small mine could wreak havoc			0
in one tunnel complex the men visited , a charge set off by the @entity56 on january 26 , 1915 , killed 26 @entity18 infantrymen and wounded 22 more			0
the pair found graffiti left by the @entity56 engineers who manned this listening post , with names and regiments and a motto : ' @entity100 ! ' ( @entity101 for the @entity102 ! )			0
the scars of artillery barrages still pockmark the ruins of a fort at @entity39 , where some 30,000 @entity18 troops died during ten days in april 1917			0
underground , @entity18 and @entity56 forces tried to penetrate each other ¿ s tunnels , and sometimes they fought hand to hand in pitch - black passageways the deadlock of trench warfare led both sides to tunnel beneath enemy positions and plant explosives			1
in the @entity120 , @entity56 engineers dug this secret network of tunnels beneath the @entity18 front lines			0
on january 26 , 1915 , they detonated a charge that killed 26 @entity18 infantrymen and wounded 22 soldiers relieved the tedium of underground life with signatures , sketches and caricatures , carvings , and even intricate relief sculptures			1
life in the quarries was vastly preferable to the muddy hell of the trenches above			1
a journalist visiting one of the caverns in 1915 noted that ' a dry shelter , straw , some furniture , a fire , are great luxuries for those returning from the trenches			1
' but conditions were still grim			1
one @entity18 soldier wrote home : ' @entity150 devour us , and it ’s teeming with lice , fleas , rats and mice			0
what ’s more , it ’s very humid and a lot of the men fall sick			0
' to pass the time , the exhausted men would daydream			0
images of women proliferate on the quarry walls , including many sentimental and idealised portraits			0
troops left the relative comfort of an underground quarry via a carved stairway leading up to the trenches			1
faith : a hundred years ago in a subterranean chapel , an unknown artist carved this image of a @entity18 soldier praying			0
artwork covers many abandoned passages under the western front among the most prolific decorators of the underground cities was the 26th ' @entity37 , one of the first @entity36 units to reach the front following @entity36 ’s entry into the war in april 1917			2
to visit the quarry where they were billeted at @entity39 , @entity187 and @entity15 climb down two wobbly ladders into a cavern 30 feet below			1
they spent hours exploring a hundred - acre complex , finding passageways strewn with countless bottles , shoes , shell cases , helmets , beds made of rusted chicken wire , even an entire cooking range with pots and pans still in place			0
the images are from a feature - the @entity206 world of @entity3 - in the august issue of @entity208			1

photographer @entity15 and writer @entity19 explored the forgotten caverns of the @entity3
the underground *chambers* are decorated with signatures , slogans and even *elaborate* carvings by soldiers
although better than the trenches , conditions in the cavern were *unpleasant* and *sudden* death never far away
