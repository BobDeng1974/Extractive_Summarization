less than 24 hours after he was born at @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity0 met his grandparents for the first time			2
but the first arrivals were not the @entity6 and the @entity7			0
instead , beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the @entity9 were @entity10 and @entity11 - better known to @entity0 as ' @entity10 ' and ' @entity12 '			1
almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away , the @entity13 have become a fixture in little @entity0 's life - with prince @entity19 left to complain that they ' never let me see my grandson '			1
visits to @entity31 , @entity19 ' @entity32 home , have been few and far between			2
by contrast , @entity33 and @entity34 regularly take their son to the @entity39 village of @entity40 where the @entity24 live in a £ 4.5m @entity42 pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside			1
indeed , it was to @entity40 that the couple decamped a day after leaving the @entity9 , with @entity0 's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather @entity10			1
the intimate photos , which show @entity0 cradled in the arms of his smiling mother , were , with hindsight , a sign of things to come			2
@entity12 , who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children , was always determined to be a hands - on grandmother - and so it has proved			1
first visitors : @entity12 and @entity62 were the first people to meet the newborn @entity0 sign of things to come : his first official photo was taken on the lawn of the @entity70 ' @entity40 home but the @entity11 matriarch 's determination to be involved in her grandson 's life has n't always gone down well with the rest of the family			1
' @entity12 has rather taken over , dictating when @entity0 naps , when and what he eats , ' confided a source to the @entity80 's @entity79			1
' all in all , behaving like she ’s @entity81 @entity12			0
' so how much involvement does @entity12 have in @entity0 's life ? the answer is plenty			2
from cosy family outings to dispensing parenting advice to her eldest child , there are few areas of @entity0 's life in which the @entity13 are n't involved			2
just a few weeks ago , @entity12 enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in @entity94 , where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday			1
although nanny @entity97 was there to deal with most of the childcare , @entity12 , who has made no secret of wanting to enjoy a close relationship with her grandson , was spotted smiling happily as she walked hand - in - hand with a toddling @entity0			2
holiday : @entity0 and his parents often holiday with the @entity13 , seen here en route to @entity94 ' queen @entity12 ' : sources say @entity12 is taking an increasing amount of control over @entity0 's life involved : @entity12 , seen here with the @entity7 , is said to be a hands - on grandmother to @entity0 and that is far from the only occasion that @entity12 has enjoyed one - on - one time with @entity0			1
just before the trip to @entity94 , the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer 's market with the third - in - line , who was , say witnesses , ' trying all the food '			1
speaking to @entity127 , another onlooker told of @entity12 's obvious pride in her grandson 's progress			0
' it was just really , really sweet			0
he was just being like a normal toddler is , running around and exploring – he is such a sweetie			0
a real bundle of fun			0
' she [ @entity12 ] just keeps telling people " he 's gorgeous , is n't he ? " like any other grandmother would say about their little one			2
' the @entity70 also joined the @entity141 and @entity34 and their infant son at @entity143 on christmas day where , according to sources , @entity34 made lunch and the family celebrated without any of the stuffiness associated with the more formal royal get - togethers			0
@entity12 's influence could also be seen in the plans for @entity0 's first birthday celebrations which , in a break with royal tradition , included a @entity156 themed party			1
not amused : @entity19 is said to dislike what he sees as his ' peripheral ' role in @entity0 's life loving : this framed photograph of @entity19 and @entity0 has pride of place at @entity163 contrast that with prince @entity33 's own first birthday which was spent alone with his nanny @entity166 because his parents were on tour in @entity169			1
@entity19 ' first year was marked in a similar way , with the @entity6 spending the day at @entity163 without either of his parents , although the @entity141 , then stationed in @entity171 , did send a model plane			2
@entity33 , who has made no secret of the fact that he wants his son to have a ' normal ' upbringing , is happy to spend time with the @entity70 , with whom he has long been close			0
something similar to his fractured childhood , which despite the best efforts of both his parents , was blighted by their divorce and , later , his mother 's death , is not what he wants for @entity0			1
instead , having seen the happy home created for @entity34 and her siblings by @entity12 and @entity10 , he is more than happy to allow them into his son 's life			0
' @entity34 ’s got a very , very close family , ' he said happily , at the time of their engagement			0
' @entity194 and @entity12 have been really loving and caring and fun			0
' they have been welcoming towards me so i ’ve felt a part of the family			0
' so is @entity0 and so will the new baby become			0
but what does that mean for @entity19 ? despite his complaints about the ' @entity202 ' , the @entity6 has ' an excellent relationship ' with his grandson , albeit one that is partly dictated by the vanishingly small number of gaps in his busy schedule			0
when he does see the baby prince , @entity19 is by all accounts a hands - on grandfather - not just to @entity0 but to @entity213 's grandchildren as well			1
different : @entity33 is said to want a less formal childhood for his son than the one he enjoyed happy : @entity33 has a close relationship with the @entity70 , in particular with father - in - law @entity10 for evidence of that , look no further than the touching photos that emerged of @entity19 last summer , where the heir to the throne was pictured with one of @entity213 's grandchildren clinging to his leg during a visit to the @entity226			1
more evidence of @entity19 ' hands - on approach to grandparenting came when photos of a meeting a in @entity163 drawing room showed a picture of @entity0 given pride of place on a sideboard			1
@entity19 also greeted the news of a second grandchild with delight , excitedly telling journalists that ' it 's wonderful to be a grandfather again			2
he added : ' i 'm looking forward to it - but i hope it will be a girl this time			0
' but whether girl or boy , there 's no doubt that @entity12 and @entity62 will once again be heavily involved in their new grandchild 's life			0
perhaps , with the prospect of two young children to enjoy , @entity19 and @entity213 will be too .			0

@entity19 is said to have complained to friends about not seeing @entity0
news of his *unhappiness* revealed by @entity80 's @entity79
is said to be upset by what he describes as the ' march of the @entity24 '
@entity11 , in particular , is a hands - on grandmother to @entity0
she spent her 60th birthday with @entity0 and his parents in @entity94
spent @entity271 with them and they are regular visitors to @entity40
