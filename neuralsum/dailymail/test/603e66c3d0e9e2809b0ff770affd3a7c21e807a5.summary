devotees endure searing heat , holding their bodies in challenging poses leaving them dripping with sweat but exhilarated at the culmination of a tough workout			2
@entity8 yoga improves mindfulness , flexibility , strength , muscle tone and general fitness , advocates boast			1
but a new study has warned the practise , which involves performing 26 poses , can raise a person 's body temperature and heart rate to dangerous levels			1
a typical session lasts for 90 minutes and is performed in a room heated to 40 ° @entity23 ) , with 40 per cent humidity			1
@entity39 , who led the study , working under @entity41 , said : ' the dramatic increases in heart rate and core temperature are alarming when you consider that there is very little movement , and therefore little cardiovascular training , going on during class			2
' twenty apparently healthy volunteers - seven men and 13 women - ranging in age from 28 to 67 took part in the study			2
all regularly practised @entity8 yoga and as such were familiar with the 26 standard poses			1
they were also all acclimatised to the hot , humid environment			0
before taking part in a session each volunteer swallowed a core body temperature sensor , and was given a heart - rate monitor to wear during the class			1
body temperature was recorded before the class started , as well as at 10 - minute intervals throughout the session			2
meanwhile heart rate was recorded every minute			0
the researchers found heart rate fluctuated throughout the class , depending on the difficulty of the pose being performed			0
but body temperature was found to steadily increase throughout the 90 - minute class , in both men and women			2
the average body temperature for men was 39 ° @entity78 ) and 38 ° c ( 102 ° f ) for women			2
scientists advise that the standard 90 - minute class is reduced to just an hour to reduce risks a male participant recorded the highest core temperature of @entity84 ( 104 ° f ) , while seven volunteers ' temperature reached 39 ° @entity78 ) , the scientists said			1
they noted that while none of their volunteers exhibited signs or symptoms of heat intolerance , body temperatures such as these can pose a danger for some people			1
they said the risk for heat - related illness , such as heat stroke , increases at 40 ° @entity100 )			1
dr @entity39 said while the excessive perspiration experienced by people doing @entity8 yoga is often cited as a benefit because it releases toxins , the results of the new study show this sweating was insufficient to cool down the body			1
she advises three ways to improve the safety of @entity8 yoga classes - duration , temperature and hydration			1
dr @entity39 noted that participants started to experience dangerous core temperatures around 60 minutes into the session			0
therefore , shortening the length of the typical class to just an hour could help minimise the risk of heat intolerance			2
in addition lowering the temperature of the room may appear obvious , but would help reduce the risk dr @entity39 said			2
furthermore , hydration lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding @entity8 yoga , she said			1
in many classes , participants are designated just one water break			0
though , many teachers do acknowledge students should hydrate as required throughout their class			0
some @entity8 enthusiasts believe that by minimising their water intake they augment the mindful aspects of the practise , with fewer water breaks decreasing the potential for mental distraction			0
dr @entity41 , said : ' nothing is gained from withholding water in any setting			0
' exercise leaders must actively encourage hydration , particularly when classes take place in extreme environments like those seen in @entity8 yoga classes			1
' he said @entity8 yoga teachers must be familiar with essential science principles surrounding exercise , including a clear understanding of the physiology of the thermo - regulation			1
' knowing the risks associated with things like blood pooling and vasodilation , as well as the signs and symptoms of heat - related illness , is absolutely essential , ' he added			0
and the researchers said it would be wise to reduce the temperatures in classes , while ensuring all participants are properly hydrated			0
one male study volunteer recorded a core temperature of @entity84 ( 104 ° f ) what are the signs of heat exhaustion ? what are the symptoms of heat stroke ? suspected heat stroke should always be treated as a medical emergency , health experts warn , advising an ambulance is called in extreme cases			1
dr @entity187 , chief science officer at the @entity188 , which commissioned the study , agreed			0
he said : ' @entity8 teachers should recognise that participants ' thermoregulatory systems will be challenged in this environment			0
' it is essential that they are aware of the early warning signs of heat intolerance			0
' the signs include cramps , headache , dizziness and general weakness			0
it is important that teachers respond appropriately and are trained in what to do in the event of an emergency to keep the participant 's safety as the top priority , dr @entity187 added			0
the researchers concluded : ' exercising in hot and humid environments - whether inside a studio while practising @entity8 yoga , or outside running during the warm months - can place participants at risk for heat - related illness , especially if those individuals do not adequately hydrate before , during and after exercise			1
' not only does it take time for the body to acclimatise to activity performed in hot and humid environments , proper hydration is crucial			0
' ' given the popularity of @entity8 yoga and its proven benefits , it is likely here to stay , ' said dr @entity187			1
' it is our job to make sure it is done safely			0

@entity8 yoga involves 26 poses performed in a room heated to 40 ° @entity23 )
typical sessions last 90 minutes and advocates say it improves mindfulness , flexibility , strength , muscle tone and general fitness
20 volunteers took part in a new study to monitor body temperatures
experts warn one man 's temperature reached 40 ° @entity257 putting him at risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke
