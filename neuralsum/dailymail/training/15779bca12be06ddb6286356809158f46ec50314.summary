multi-millionaire @entity0 has given an inordinate amount of time and energy to two places in recent years			1
one is the deprived @entity6 quarter of @entity7			2
the other – her private passion – is @entity9			0
the farmhouse , dating from 1862 , was in a dilapidated state when she bought it , but she has devoted the past years to restoring it to its full glory			0
@entity17 - born @entity0 , who made her fortune in occupational health after moving to @entity20 at 18 to study as a nurse , took part in @entity25 ’s @entity24 series in 2009			1
@entity0 at her @entity27 home , @entity28			1
mrs @entity0 spent £ 750k to bring the @entity30 gem back to life she lived on job - seekers ’ allowance in @entity7 , using the city ’s food bank , while learning about the work of certain charities there			1
she ended up donating £ 40,000 to two of them			1
‘ i was brought up by my grandparents in @entity43 , near @entity44 , in very humble circumstances , ’ she says , pouring tea in her comfortable drawing room			0
‘ and being in @entity7 brought back memories of those days , when my grandfather , a gorgeous guy , also struggled to get the next meal on the table			2
it struck me that i should give something back			0
by the time i returned home to @entity9 , i was less of a capitalist and more of a philanthropist			0
’ @entity0 , 59 , first saw @entity9 , which stands in glorious isolation outside @entity27 in leafy @entity28 , in 1998			1
the dining room and kitchen area at the stunning house she paid £ 700,000 for the property and , even though it had a horrible 1970s look and birds were actually nesting in the upstairs rooms , she immediately wanted this to be the house where she would live			1
so she forked out another £ 750,000 on a renovation project , hiring top @entity69 interior designer @entity68 and reading up on the property ’s history to ensure none of the changes damaged the fabric of the house			1
now @entity9 is a more chic version of the @entity30 original			2
the drawing room , which had the appearance of a cheap mock - @entity81 saloon bar when she first saw it , is now tastefully decorated in creams and gold , with an impressive open fireplace			0
across the hall and down the corridor there is a tiny sitting room on the left which @entity0 describes as ‘ the smallest cinema in the world ’ , and opposite is a dark , formal dining room			2
‘ people used to design rooms for different times of the day , ’ she says			0
‘ and this is a night - time room			0
’ straight ahead there is the white - washed farmhouse kitchen with its light oak furnishings and huge range			0
according to her research , the farm labourers in @entity30 times would call by for their food – and be handed it out of the kitchen window			2
she paid £ 700,000 for the property and , even though it had a horrible 1970s look and birds were actually nesting in the upstairs rooms , she immediately wanted this to be the house where she would live			1
now @entity9 is a more chic version of the @entity30 original next to the kitchen the farm animals ’ winter quarters have been turned into a high - tech office where @entity0 ’s partner @entity122 pores over computer screens , with the family ’s pair of @entity127 terriers , @entity128 and @entity129 , at his feet			1
one recurring feature in the house are the stencilled mottos and quotations which adorn many of the rooms			2
one of these – ‘ happiness unshared is scarcely happiness ’ – seems particularly apt for this @entity24			2
what , i wonder , did she learn from making the documentary ? ‘ i learnt that poverty and hunger are very dangerous , ’ she says , leading the way out into the gardens			0
@entity0 appeared on the @entity24 in 2009			1
she lived on job - seekers ' allowance in @entity7 , using the city 's food bank , while learning about the work of certain charities there			1
she ended up donating £ 40,000 to two of them ‘ if you ca n’t eat , you ca n’t think			1
if you ca n’t think , you ca n’t work and if you ca n’t work , you ca n’t help yourself			0
’ however , @entity0 does not believe food banks and financial handouts alone will solve the problems of the country ’s poor			1
‘ it ’s a generational thing and we have lost some of our skills base , ’ she says			0
‘ people should be taught in schools how to budget and how to make , say , a broth from inexpensive ingredients			0
maybe that ’s not the job of the teachers – maybe the charities should do it			0
but somebody must provide an education at this level			0
’ although she was on @entity24 , there is nothing remotely hair - shirt or holier - than - thou about @entity0			1
a self - confessed party lover , one of her happiest memories of her time at the house is of the fancy - dress dance she held two years ago , when she packed 75 people , all in @entity30 costume , into a giant marquee in the grounds			1
she also has a penchant for creating ‘ refreshment ’ areas outside			0
a self - confessed party lover , one of her happiest memories of her time at the house is of the fancy - dress dance she held two years ago , when she packed 75 people , all in @entity30 costume , into a giant marquee in the grounds there is a special ‘ gin and tonic ’ table set above an 18ft waterfall , a champagne - quaffing corner for pre-dinner drinks in a thatched safari hut and an afternoon tea table up on some turrets , next to her hot tub			1
the property is now on the market for £ 2.35 million , and sitting in ‘ gin and tonic ’ corner , looking over this impressive five - bedroom home , it is difficult to resist the question : why move ? ‘ i sold my main company last year and although i have a property portfolio and a brand development company to keep me interested , i want to semi-retire , ’ she says			2
‘ i love @entity217 and @entity218 so i ’d like to move there			0
’ @entity0 does charity work – for @entity221 , which supports vulnerable women , and the @entity225 food banks – which she will continue , but there is also something else that will occupy her : ‘ i have one unfulfilled ambition : to write children ’s stories			2
