published : 06:01 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 14:11 est , 14 november 2012 in past years arriving students would have to make do with some money off vouchers and maybe a notebook if they were lucky			0
however , @entity7 undergraduate @entity5 students are set to get something far better when they arrive - their very own robot			0
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) has provided 200 robots for first year students to take home , look after and experiment with throughout the year			1
students arriving at @entity16 will each be given a robot when they arrive			1
lecturers hope it will help them become more engaged with their computing coursework it is hoped that as well as giving them a chance to work on their practical skills outside the lab , the robots will enable students to compete with one another through tasks such as navigating obstacle courses			1
this will culminate in a robot @entity33 , to be held during the @entity35			0
apart from moving in different directions , the robots ( known as finches ) have a beak that can change colour , an accelerometer so the orientation is known , @entity44 sensors to detect obstacles , a light sensor , a thermocouple to determine temperature and a buzzer			1
professor @entity50 , @entity51 at @entity10 , said : ' teaching programming to novices is traditionally challenging so we came up with the novel idea of giving each student their own robot to help with their learning			0
' the bonus of these finches is that they provide instant feedback - the student can see whether they respond as intended			0
' if you write some code for the robot to turn left and it turns right then it 's immediately apparent there 's a problem			0
write caption here ' we also hope that because they are fun to work with , they will arouse students â€™ curiosity and help them to gain a better understanding of the subject area			1
' this is the first time such a large number robots have been given out to students in such a way			2
the @entity84 , specifically designed by @entity85 to support the teaching of computer science , have the advantage of being robust and affordable			1
although the idea is at the development stage @entity10 also plan to take the robots into local schools , alongside first and second year students , to help support learning and encourage more children to think about taking up computer sciences			1
the robots ( known as finches ) were developed by @entity85			2
they have a ' beak ' that can change colour , an accelerometer so the orientation is known , @entity44 sensors to detect obstacles , a light sensor , a thermocouple to determine temperature and a buzzer			0
they are plugged into a computer 's usb port and can be programmed easily			2
the @entity84 robot 's sensors			0

@entity16 to give 200 robots to computer science undergraduates
also plan to visit local school with them to *persuade* children to study the subject
