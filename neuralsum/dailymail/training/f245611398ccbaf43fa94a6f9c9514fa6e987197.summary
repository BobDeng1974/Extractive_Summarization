by @entity0 @entity1 received at least 10 calls from a @entity4 representative who was offering him money not to do an interview with a current affair a @entity4 subsidiary has been accused of trying to prevent a victim of its financial advice scandal from speaking out by allegedly offering him money to keep quiet			1
@entity1 had agreed to an interview with @entity16 's @entity8 two weeks ago to tell all about his ordeal , when the bank 's subsidiary lost tens of thousands of dollars of his life savings by investing it in high - risk products			1
but on wednesday , the 79 - year - old claimed he had been harassed by an employee of @entity25 - a subsidiary of @entity4 - in a bid to stop him from talking			2
the latest accusation levelled at the bank and @entity25 comes after both were involved in a financial advice scandal , which dated back to between 2003 and 2012 , and involved some financial advisers transferring their clients ' life savings into high - risk investments and giving poor advice			0
in some cases , it has been alleged they were forging the signatures of clients to transfer to products that generated more profit			0
it is thought the dealings had lost millions of dollars for 12,000 customers			0
mr @entity1 invested $ 125,000 with @entity25 - but later found out that amount had dwindled to $ 9,000			1
after the senior citizen had been interviewed by @entity8 over his experience of the scandal , mr @entity1 suddenly got a call from a @entity25 representative			1
the program 's reporter , @entity53 , heard recordings of about 10 phone conversations with the pensioner over the course of a few days			0
recordings of the calls were made without mr @entity1 's permission the bank refused to hand over tapes of the exchanges to @entity8 , but the program believed one of the calls which lasted for three minutes had two minutes missing			1
speaking about the calls he had with the @entity25 representative , mr @entity1 said : ' it was just harassment and it went on all day , continually getting calls : " have you called @entity8 yet ? have you pulled out of a current affair yet ? " ' mr @entity1 told @entity8 that in one conversation , that may not have been recorded , the representative asked him : ' how much would it take for you to withdraw from @entity8 ? '			1
' they were offering me an inducement not to go ahead with the interview , ' he said			0
mr @entity1 said the woman offered him a financial incentive for his silence after he lost more than $ 100,000 in savings with @entity25 the subsidiary of @entity4 recorded the calls without mr @entity1 's permission , but two minutes of one phone call has gone missing earlier this month on july 3 , the bank 's ceo @entity90 apologised for @entity4 's mishandling of fraud and misconduct allegations mr @entity1 claimed he called the woman back and named his price			1
he said she replied with ' oh , well , i ’m actually out of the office right now and i ’ll get back to you tomorrow '			0
' and i thought , well , she ’s going along with me			0
she ’s not saying , " we ’re not in the business of offering money , " she ’s going along with me , ' mr @entity1 said			2
the next day the pressure on mr @entity1 to kill the @entity8 story ramped up			1
in one of the calls , it was alleged by mr @entity1 that the representative said : ' i thought you emailed [ @entity8 ] not to go ahead with that interview until we ’ve discussed further ? if you tell them you do n’t want to proceed with the program , they wo n’t proceed			1
' mr @entity1 said he told her he needed a good reason not to go ahead and wanted an offer			2
the representative allegedly replied : ' things do n’t move that quickly			0
we will reopen your file and look at it again and i will be back in touch with you today			0
if you do n’t want to proceed with that interview , you are perfectly within your rights to tell them			0
' but a @entity4 spokesperson said allegations it tried to offer money to a customer was ' purely fanciful ' but @entity4 has denied its staff had tried to offer anyone money in exchange for silence			1
' we strongly deny @entity8 's allegation that the @entity4 offered an incentive not to appear on the show			2
this is purely fanciful , ' a bank spokesperson said in a statement to @entity8			1
' our priority is to ensure mr @entity1 's case is fully investigated and resolved			2
we are continuing to work with mr @entity1 to ensure he is happy with the management of his case and that we reach a fair and appropriate outcome under the @entity152 , ' they said			0
' in this instance , mr @entity1 's case manager , with whom he has been working with for some months , was out of the office on annual leave , so to ensure accurate notes were taken to assist in resolving mr @entity1 's complaints , recorded some of the calls			1
' although this was done with the right intention , it is not standard practice and the case manager should have asked for mr @entity1 's permission to record the call			2
' we have apologised to mr @entity1 and have explained the unusual circumstances			0
