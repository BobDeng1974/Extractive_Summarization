@entity0 was accused of ‘ absolute madness ’ after flinging an arm recklessly into the face of @entity8 during @entity5 ’s emphatic victory over @entity6 at @entity7			1
@entity0 , who also scored an own goal in the 4 - 1 defeat to his old club , had already been warned about his discipline in the build - up to the game by @entity6 boss @entity15 who criticised the player ’s ‘ laziness ’			1
and he landed himself in more controversy by catching can in the first half			0
referee @entity20 was a few yards from the incident and decided not to award a freekick , but it remains to be seen if the @entity24 take a different view			0
@entity5 ’s @entity26 may also be in hot water after he appeared to hit out at @entity28 in the second half			2
@entity0 ( left ) had another evening to forget as @entity6 lost 4 - 1 to @entity5 the former @entity31 star leaves the pitch after scoring an own goal and courting controversy with an elbow @entity0 ’s former @entity7 teammate @entity36 criticised him afterwards , and revealed that such flashpoints were not uncommon at the club ’s @entity39 training ground when they were there			1
‘ it ’s absolute madness , ’ said @entity36			2
‘ you 'd see this two or three times a week in training			0
he has bags of ability , @entity0 , but unfortunately he can do stuff like that too			2
’ @entity36 ’s fellow @entity52 pundit @entity51 claimed that the offence was worse than the one that earned @entity5 ’s @entity56 a straight red card against @entity58 earlier this month			1
' @entity15 has already talked about the lack of discipline from @entity0 ahead of this game and this just proves it , ’ said @entity51			1
‘ when you first see it you ca n't really see it but on second viewing it is not pretty at all			0
‘ the problem is the referee can not put in his report that he has n't seen that because he is never going to have a better view of it than he has there			0
it 's not as bad as the @entity76 one ( elbow on @entity79 ’s @entity78 ) but it is worse than the @entity56 one we saw a few weeks ago			1
' the @entity6 star was caught on camera flinging an elbow towards @entity8 during the first half @entity0 catches the @entity5 midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism despite can going to ground complaining he had been struck , @entity0 escaped without punishment @entity0 , who has already collected six yellow cards and a red this campaign , should escape retrospective punishment for this latest brush with trouble because @entity20 saw the incident			1
but it was just one more problem for @entity101 on a night when he had hoped to show his team could make a challenge for the @entity105 places			0
@entity0 , who joined @entity6 from @entity5 for £ 5million last year , was restored to the starting line - up last night			1
@entity15 admitted afterwards that he had not seen the incident but would look at it on the journey back to @entity110			2
the @entity6 boss might not be impressed if he sees footage of @entity0 joking with @entity5 ’s @entity113 at a corner moments before heading into his own net			1
‘ i have n’t seen it , ’ said @entity15			2
‘ i ’ve been asked that question already and i ’ll have to look at it on the way home and judge it			0
‘ but i thought he played fantastic tonight , very good			0
that was the @entity0 that i know and he showed that quality with his passing			2
’ @entity5 boss @entity126 tried to play down both incidents involving @entity0 and @entity26			1
‘ i have seen the two , ’ said @entity126			0
‘ the cameras will probably show it a hundred times tomorrow and we will get bored of watching it			0
‘ @entity0 has flung his arm out and caught @entity8 on the side of his head			1
@entity139 ’s incident , the centre half has slapped him on the side of the head and he has put his hand up and slapped him on the side of the head			0
‘ i think the referee has called both right and got on with the game			0
’ @entity0 capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for @entity5 's fourth the 22 - year - old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at @entity7 @entity0 is likely to come under scrutiny after being seen joking with @entity113 before the corner @entity0 's evening got even worse when he scored an own goal as he flicked @entity157 's corner past @entity158 at the near post			1
the own goal extinguished any hope @entity6 had of getting back into the match as @entity5 opened up a three - goal lead with just 20 minutes to play			2
@entity0 was marking @entity113 at the near post and was caught laughing and joking with the @entity5 midfielder prior to the corner being taken			1
' i do n't think @entity15 will be too pleased with @entity0 ( having a bit of a chuckle with @entity113 ) when you 're losing , ' @entity36 said after the game			1
' i never saw the benefit of laughing or smiling at an opposition player , ' @entity51 added			2
' i mean all it can be is a distraction			0
i ca n't see how it can work , particularly from a set piece			0
i do n't think @entity15 will be happy with it and in fact the only person it helped was @entity113			0

@entity0 had been warned by boss @entity15 about his discipline
the midfielder caught @entity8 with an elbow that went *unpunished*
@entity51 and @entity36 criticised @entity0 for the elbow
@entity188 's night went from bad to worse when he scored an own goal
the midfielder headed past @entity158 from a @entity5 corner
