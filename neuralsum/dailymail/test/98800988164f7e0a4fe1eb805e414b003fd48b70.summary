the first double hundred of @entity2 ' career helped @entity3 into a position of strength on the opening day of their @entity8 match against @entity9 at @entity10			1
the @entity11 international was unbeaten on 222 not out as the home side reached 393 for seven by stumps , having been invited to bat first			1
@entity2 scored his runs from 250 balls , with 37 fours and a six and having shared in a third wicket stand of 171 with @entity20 , who scored 59			1
@entity21 , with two for 58 and @entity22 , two for 90 , returned the leading figures for the @entity9 bowlers on a tough day for the defending champions			1
@entity2 , pictured in action for @entity3 earlier this month , completed a double century on sunday @entity2 ' passed three figures for the 10th time in his career , spoiling the return of @entity31 , back skippering @entity9 again after serving a four match suspension			1
@entity31 rotated all seven bowlers at his disposal but all found it difficult to put the brake on @entity39 ' scoring			2
in general , too much width was offered to the 26 - year - old and he capitalised fully to reach his century from 131 balls and his 150 from 173			2
@entity20 was a perfect foil for his @entity46 team - mate , content to play the supportive role in reaching his own 50 from 89 balls , with nine @entity51 's spirits were lifted just before the tea interval when @entity22 struck twice in an over , snaring @entity20 with an lbw decision and then providing enough temptation for @entity56 to nudge one into the hands of @entity58 at first slip			2
@entity60 made 18 before falling just before the taking of the second new ball , guiding @entity64 - born @entity63 to second slip			0
@entity2 , in action during an @entity11 nets session in @entity68 in march , has n't given up on playing @entity70 cricket @entity2 went past his previous best of 184 , made against @entity72 in 2011 , and then had his only two scares of the day , against the bowling of @entity21			1
an uppish chip to mid-on was totally missed by @entity63 , who claimed he lost the flight of the ball			0
on 197 a huge shout for lbw was turned down by umpire @entity81 , to the dismay of the entire fielding unit			0
a four off @entity84 eased home nerves , though , and a standing ovation was duly afforded @entity2 for reaching the 200 landmark from 234 deliveries			2
he will return on the second morning , after the final over of the day was cut short following the dismissal of @entity91 , also caught in the slip cordon , off @entity21			0
@entity3 's openers both made 27 before the visiting attack struck twice during the morning session			2
@entity96 was given out lbw to @entity21 , beaten by one that came back and missed the inside edge			0
@entity99 , who had scored centuries in both of his first class appearances this season , became a notable first scalp for @entity104 , who at 17 years 161 days is @entity9 's sixth youngest debutant , but it mattered little once @entity2 got to work			1
@entity2 hopes his brilliant knock against @entity9 sends a message to the @entity11 selectors @entity2 said : ' it 's a very proud day for me to make that score against the county champions and against a very good attack			1
' i 'm very pleased with how the day has gone , it has been one of those days where all the shots i 've tried have come off			0
' they bowled pretty well at me in the morning session but i knew if i got through it , it would become easier and i 'd be all right			0
' asked if his knock had sent any sort of message to the @entity11 selectors , he added : ' i hope to show that i can make scores in all three formats			2
' this year i want to make as many big scores as i can in this format because it 's still my dream to play test cricket			1
' @entity9 captain @entity31 said : ' we were n't at our best today but fair play to @entity2			1
' i thought he played really well - a chanceless innings really - but we only bowled to 60 or 70 per cent of our potential			0
' it was a good toss to win , there was plenty in the wicket in the first session but we did n't utilise it			0
' it was just nice to get back out over the white line and get 96 overs in the legs			0
i hope we can get it right in the morning and bowl them out quickly			0

@entity2 was unbeaten on 222 not out for @entity3 who reached 393 for seven by stumps in their clash against @entity9
it is the first double hundred of @entity2 ' career passing previous best of 184
and @entity2 said it is still his ' dream ' to play test cricket for @entity11
