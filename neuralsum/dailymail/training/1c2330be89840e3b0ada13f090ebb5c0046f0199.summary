testifying under the @entity148 , the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly			0
but she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks			0
she said the video , which several jurors turned away from , was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case			0
dirty : the attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home , pictured , where the victim was assaulted by as many as 20 men she identified @entity8 in the film laughing in the background , telling the attacker to ' beat that ho			2

alleged attacker : @entity236 , pictured , is one of the men accused of raping the 11 - year - old the prosecutor added that while the girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos , these individuals had ' duped , tricked and talked her into doing things against her best interests , ' according to the @entity246			2

@entity30 tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out , arguing that police improperly questioned @entity8			2

those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records			0
the case brought unflattering attention to @entity48 , a town of 9,000 people , after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened , saying she wore makeup , looked older and was n't properly supervised by her parents			2
