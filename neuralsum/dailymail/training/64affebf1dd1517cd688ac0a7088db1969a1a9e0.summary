by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 19:04 est , 10 january 2013 millions of pounds is being wasted on government reviews and consultations , mps said yesterday			1
the @entity4 has opened 984 inquiries – more than one for each day it has been in power – into issues as diverse as ice - cream van chimes and the electronic monitoring of pigs			1
other reviews include whether street sweepers should require qualifications and whether mothers should be able to use vouchers to buy frozen vegetables			1
@entity1 have said millions of pounds is being wasted after an investigation found the @entity4 opened 984 inquiries since coming into power @entity20 , a @entity21 member of the commons public accounts committee , yesterday called on the @entity23 to investigate , perhaps not seeing the irony of his request			1
‘ the huge scale of these reviews raises questions , and i would n’t discourage the @entity23 from looking at this area , ’ he said			1
‘ on this scale they must have serious financial implications , with hundreds of civil servants being diverted to work on them			0
‘ these reviews could lead to delay and sclerosis inside departments , because civil servants will be hanging around waiting , rather than taking action			1
‘ i would be very interested in knowing from the @entity23 how much this all costs and how effective and economic it is			0
’ critics say the figures show @entity42 has broken a pledge to slash the number of pointless reviews			1
late last year the prime minister vowed to ‘ cut through the dither ’ , adding : ‘ if there is no need for a consultation , do n’t have one			0
’ yet a year after saying in 2011 : ‘ it is hard to believe we need government regulations on issues such as ice - cream van jingles ’ , his government set up a consultation on the very same issue			1
the @entity4 has opened more than one inquiry for each day it has been in power , while @entity63 's @entity62 alone has set up 84 reviews an inquiry was opened into how long ice - cream van chimes should ring for and where they should be able to ring , but there has been no response from the government in six months an investigation by @entity73 found that many of the 984 reviews have not yet been acted upon			1
the survey of the 15 largest @entity78 departments showed that almost a third of the consultations set up since 2010 had still not received an official response			0
@entity82 , @entity21 chairman of the public administration committee , called on parliamentary select committees to ask individual departments for explanations			0
‘ it is staggering that the government should spend so much time and money and produce so few outcomes , ’ he said			0
‘ this gives the term “ kicked into the long grass ” a new reality			0
the government has also looked into whether pig farmers should inform councils about the movements of their animals by letter or e-mail ‘ the prime minister complains rightly about dithering and inaction but @entity78 seems to be institutionally predisposed to dithering and inaction by review and consultation			2
this could be costing tens of millions of pounds			0
’ the 17,000 - word review into ice cream van chimes , sent to 23 organisations , asked the public how long chimes should ring for , where they should ring and until what time			1
one question asked whether chimes should be played after 8pm because children ’s bedtimes are getting later			2
twelve months on , ministers have still not come to a decision on the less - than - pressing issue			2
a consultation by the @entity122 was prompted by a one - man campaign to save a railway committee that decides which artefacts should be saved for the nation			2
@entity127 of @entity128 made a plea in the @entity130 that the eight - man @entity131 , which costs £ 100,000 a year , be saved from the bonfire of the quangos			2
a consultation was launched and all 32 respondents supported the plan to move the committee ’s role to the @entity140			0
another consultation into @entity143 wine received no responses at all			0
@entity145 , director of the @entity147 think - tank , said : ‘ @entity42 promised a post-bureaucratic age but his record in government is very different			2
’ @entity63 ’s @entity62 has set up 84 reviews , @entity154 ’s @entity153 , the @entity151 has set up 73 and the @entity155 80 .			0

the @entity4 has opened 984 inquiries since coming into power
