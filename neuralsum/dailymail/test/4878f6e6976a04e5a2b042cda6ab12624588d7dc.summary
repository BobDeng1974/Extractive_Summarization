the new @entity1 film ran into a huge problem on wednesday when a group of extras stormed off the set			1
@entity7 actors appearing in the @entity8 6 , a spoof of @entity10 that stars and was written by @entity1 , left the set after they became offended by the script 's jokes about their race and culture			1
it was so bad in fact that even the cultural adviser for the movie , which is filming in @entity21 , walked off the set			1
' i was asked a long time ago to do some work on this and i was n't down for it			0
then they told me it was going to be a comedy , but it would not be racist , ' said @entity33			0
' so i agreed to it but on monday things started getting weird on the set			2
' among the many problems he cited were the costumes that were being used , the way the hair was being styled , and the film 's treatment of women			1
' we were supposed to be @entity62 , but it was really stereotypical and we did not look @entity62 at all			0
we looked more like @entity65 , ' he explained			0
' one thing that really offended a lot of people was that there was a female character called @entity72 's breath			2
one character says " hey , @entity74			1
" and the @entity76 woman says , " how did you know my name ? ' " in another scene , an @entity62 woman is seen squatting and urinating while smoking a pipe			2
as for the dress , the @entity62 do not wear their hair in braids or chokers while that is common for @entity87			0
@entity33 ( on right with actor @entity89 ) said the film was offensive towards @entity7 women @entity92 ( above as @entity93 ) with @entity1 in the background in red bandanna were back to filming oin thursday @entity33 said that though the film is about the @entity62 ( traditionl dress on left ) extras were dressed more like @entity65 ( traditional dress on right ) , with braids and chokers making matters worse says @entity33 is that no one felt like they were being listened to by the production team			1
' they just treated us as if we should just be on the side , ' said @entity33			0
' when we did speak with the main director , he was trying to say the disrespect was not intentional and this was a comedy			2
' the cultural adviser meanwhile asked to speak to @entity1 according to one extra , but was refused , and when that extra , @entity112 , later complained , she was told ; ' it 's in the script and we are not going to change it			1
' @entity116 later said on her @entity117 ; ' i 've had some time to sit and think about everything that 's been going on , on the set of this movie @entity123			1
' something just did n't feel right , i had a heavy heart while being on set but still tried to make the best of it			2
but after finding out what was in the script and what some of the movie scences portrayed , a group of us left the set upset and with our hearts pounding due to the disrespect of our native people			1
' it 's been an emotional and upsetting time since we left the set but we have stood up for what we think is right and we are going to stand by our decision			2
still and always will represent our people ! ! ! ' the film 's director @entity145 ( above ) with @entity1 on the set @entity148 ( above with @entity149 ) has a small role in the film @entity1 and his production company @entity152 have yet to comment , though @entity153 , who is producing the movie , did release a statement			1
' the movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason : because it is ridiculous , ' they said			2
' it is a broad satire of @entity164 movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of - but in on - the joke			1
' that cast includes @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity148 , @entity169 and @entity32 , among others			1
@entity30 has said before that he has distant @entity7 ancestry on his mother 's side , specifically @entity174 and @entity175			1
producer @entity176 ( second from right ) shared this photo from set earlier this month with @entity179 , @entity149 and @entity30 @entity32 also has a role in the film ( above with director @entity145 ) other stars in the film include @entity184 ( top left ) , @entity185 ( top right ) , @entity186 ( middle right ) , @entity188 ( bottom left ) , and @entity190 ( bottom right ) @entity192 , a 74 - year - old @entity193 , did not seem to feel like he was in on the joke as he too left the set			1
' they were being disrespectful , ' he said			0
' they were bringing up those same old arguments that @entity199 uses in defending the @entity200			0
but let me tell you , our dignity is not for sale			0
it is a real shame because a lot of people probably stay because they need a job			0
' he then added ; ' we understand this is a comedy , we understand this is humor , but we wo n’t tolerate disrespect			0
i told the director if he had talked to a native woman the way they were talked to in this movie - i said i would knock his ass out			1
' ' when i began doing this film , i had an uneasy feeling inside of me and i felt so conflicted , ' said @entity223 , a @entity224 who studied film at @entity226			2
' i talked to a former instructor at @entity226 and he told me to take this as finally experiencing stereotyping first hand			0
we talked to the producers about our concerns			0
' filming also went on wednesday after the extras walked off , with @entity145 even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees ( above ) the @entity7 extras found so offensive @entity238 then explained that , just as @entity33 said , talking about her concerns with the production team did not work			1
' they just told us , " if you guys are so sensitive , you should leave , ' " she said			0
' i was just standing there and got emotional and teary - eyed			2
i did n’t want to cry but the feeling just came over me			0
this is supposed to be a comedy that makes you laugh			0
a film like this should not make someone feel this way			0
' despite this , filming seemed to continue on thursday , with @entity92 , who plays @entity93 in the film , posting a photo with @entity1 in the background			1
filming also went on wednesday after the extras walked off , with director @entity145 even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees the @entity7 extras found so offensive			1
and not all the @entity267 on the set had issues with the script , with @entity271 , a @entity272 native who also draws satirical cartoons , telling the @entity274 ; ' there 's nothing worse [ in the script ] than anything in my cartoons			2
if anything racial or racist happened i would have walked off			0
the shoot has been fine , everybody has been happy			0

a dozen @entity7 extras and the cultural adviser walked off the set of @entity1 's new movie on wednesday
the film , the @entity8 6 , is a spoof of @entity10 that is being made for @entity153

this included *inaccurate* costumes and referring to one woman as ' @entity74 '
the film also stars @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity148 and @entity30 , who has *previously* said he has distant @entity7 ancestry
@entity153 said in a statement ; ' it is a broad satire of @entity164 movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of - but in on - the joke '
