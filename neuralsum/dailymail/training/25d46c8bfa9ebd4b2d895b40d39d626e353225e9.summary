@entity0 was accused yesterday of taking ‘ a smash and grab ’ approach with its demand for new powers to seize money directly from people ’s bank accounts			1
@entity10 ’s leading tax experts warned the taxman risks being ‘ unconstitutional ’ with the controversial plans , which could come into force within months			1
the proposed new powers - which were published in the @entity15 and subject to a public consultation which closed yesterday - have triggered an outcry among tax experts			1
@entity0 has been accused of taking a ' smash and grab ' approach with its demand for new powers to seize money directly from people ’s bank accounts if @entity0 believes anyone owes money to them , they will be able to take the cash directly from current accounts , joint accounts or tax - free @entity29 to settle an unpaid tax bill			1
around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers , known as the ‘ direct recovery of debts ’			1
each will typically owe £ 5,800			2
to be targeted , somone must owe at least £ 1,000 to the tax man – and must have at least £ 5,000 left across their accounts after the money for their tax debt has been removed			1
in its response , the @entity44 said it has ‘ no sympathy ’ for those who do not pay the tax they owe despite having the means to do so			0
but it added : ‘ under @entity10 law , if someone owes you money , you can not just help yourself to it			2
permission of the court is required			0
‘ for these reasons , the proposed new powers are unconstitutional and wrong in principle			1
independent , judicial oversight is essential for any such recovery power			0
’ if it is granted the new powers , @entity0 will not need to apply to a court in order to grab money directly from people ’s accounts			1
@entity68 , head of taxation at the @entity70 , said : ‘ these new powers are knocking at the door of being unconstitutional			2
@entity68 ( pictured ) , head of taxation at the @entity70 , has said the new powers are ' knocking at the door of being unconstitutional ' ‘ it will mean @entity0 can take a ‘ smash and grab ’ approach by delving into someone ’ s back account at will and taking their money			1
’ the @entity44 ’s response also raised concerns that @entity0 will ‘ inevitably make errors ’ which could have ‘ very damaging consequences ’			2
official documents reveal it expects to get £ 375million between 2015 and 2019 , but the @entity44 said this amount is small when it is compared to the potential loss of trust among the public			0
it warned : ‘ the publicity given to any case where @entity91 is used inappropriately would have a damaging effect on public confidence in the tax system			0
‘ in the @entity10 , voluntary compliance and trust in the tax system in the tax system are crucial to the way the system operates			0
the cost of trust being eroded will far outweigh the sums @entity91 is expected to yield			0
’ @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said he is fearful of the vulnerable people who will be targeted by the new powers , such as the elderly and the sick			2
while @entity0 says it will have contacted a person at least nine times before removing their money , mr @entity104 said : ‘ that is not going to be make a difference if you never got the letters [ because you are abroad ] or do not understand why you are receiving it			1
’ the @entity118 , the business lobby group , also yesterday urged the government to scrap the plans			0
@entity121 , the forum ’s head of policy , said it ‘ unequivocally condemns tax avoidance and tax evasion ’ , but fears the proposed new powers will ‘ unfairly target ’ small firms			2
during a recent grilling by mps on the @entity131 , @entity132 , chief executive of @entity0 , said the people who will be targeted by the new money - grabbing powers can afford to pay their tax , but simply refuse to pay it			1
she said they are ‘ gaming the system ’			0
mrs @entity132 said : ‘ they do n’t dispute that the tax is due			0
they just wo n’t pay			0
they just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action			0
