by @entity0 this week has been like , so hot			1
there 's been a mini heat wave in @entity3 and so we were in dire need of some alfresco pool action in the city			1
thankfully my friend @entity8 ( who is a @entity11 ) was on hand to gain @entity0 and i access to a private pool on the roof of an achingly hip members club			1
you had to be up early to get a sun - lounger ( they were all gone by 8am ) and they were like gold dust			0
during the day i watched a couple of women hovering by one pool chair for over an hour because they believed it was about to be vacated			2
@entity24 's out , guns out : @entity0 and @entity0 enjoyed a spot of sunbathing this week at an exclusive members rooftop pool in @entity3 luckily our friends had managed to hold us a couple of seats , and so we lay down in the sun and surveyed the surrounding company of stylish 20 and 30 - something hard - body creatives from behind a pair of dark @entity38			1
thankfully i 'm in pretty good nick at the moment , thanks to the bumper supply of @entity43 supplements that i brought out with me , so it was a case of , ' @entity45 , guns out ' round the pool			2
the drinks started flowing and it was a beautiful day with an ugly bar bill at the end of it			0
@entity0 with singer @entity8 , the handy name - drop that got him access to the private club we were meant to have an early night but someone would have had to handcuffed us to the bed to make us miss the governor 's @entity58 after - show party			2
i was glad at that point that we had n't brought the @entity62 handcuffs with us to @entity3			2
( we would never have got them through airport security anyway )			0
the party was at the @entity67 club and i bumped into @entity69 guitarist @entity68 fresh from his main - stage performance at the event			0
he was on good form but sadly mrs @entity74 ( none other than @entity76 ) was n't at the party			0
united nations : @entity0 is keen to enhance the ' special relationship ' between the @entity79 and the @entity80 we managed to make a quite few new @entity80 friends at the bar further enhancing the ' special relationship ' between our two great nations			1
it 's now the end of the week and i 'm concerned that i 've not planned ahead for @entity87			1
unfortunately it 's not likely that i 'm going to be able to see him on the day , so online delivery from high - end toiletries retailer @entity92 looks the best option			0
first i thought of some @entity94 , i use it quite a bit , but dad 's generation might still not be ready for a daily moisturizer			0
a safer bet would be the @entity102 di @entity101			0
shaving is always a bit of a drag , ( which is why you often see me with a beard ) but this product makes the experience almost enjoyable			0
lots of @entity111 , and @entity87 from @entity0			1
@entity0 recommends the @entity102 di @entity101 for @entity87 as way of taking the chore out of shaving for a personal treat @entity0 loves the @entity94			1

@entity0 is currently in @entity3 *filming* a special *series* of @entity0
this week he has taken a break from the heat by *relaxing* by a rooftop pool
he also gives you gift *inspiration* for @entity87
