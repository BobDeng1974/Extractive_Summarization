the board showing two added minutes had just been held up and @entity2 set about trying to salvage some pride			2
but the more those in blue shirts chased the ball , the further away it went			0
@entity9 , bursting with confidence and belief , were tormenting their hosts , sending them dizzy with possession as they dumped them out of @entity12			2
@entity9 qualified for the 2015 @entity13 with a 4 - 2 aggregate win over @entity2 in their play - off @entity9 under 21 manager @entity16 celebrates after guiding his team to their 10th straight victory @entity2 @entity19 : @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 ( @entity26 67 ) , @entity27 ( @entity28 79 ) , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ( @entity33 33 )			1

and to think they say @entity9 never win with style			2
with the stakes high and the pressure intense , @entity9 secured a place at next summer ’s under 21 @entity68 in a very un-english way			1
there was no scrapping , no backs against the wall , no bitten fingernails , just the smooth execution of meticulous planning and preparation			0
thanks to goals from @entity79 ’s @entity42 and @entity80 midfielder @entity45 , giving them a 2 - 1 win on the night — 4 - 2 on aggregate — @entity16 ’s squad will head to the @entity85 next summer as one of the favourites to lift the trophy			1
as @entity9 were victorious in @entity92 , playing football as it should be , @entity89 — winners of this competition in 2011 and 2013 — were falling by the wayside , as were @entity95			1
do not underestimate what an achievement it is to be in the finals of this tournament			0
@entity16 has not put a foot wrong in the last 13 months and this game saw everything he has been working towards fall into place			2
@entity9 , even without many key players , dismantled @entity2 and in the process laid down a blueprint for the future			1
@entity92 , famed for being the town where the train broke down on @entity111 , may have been a surprise destination for this game , but the hosts were welcoming and there was no sinister edge , as had been the case in @entity118 when @entity9 faced @entity119 two years ago			1
@entity2 almost had the perfect start , too			2
with just two minutes gone , they broke swiftly down @entity9 ’s left and @entity30 crossed for @entity123 , who seemed certain to score with a right - foot half - volley , until @entity125 intervened			1
@entity9 took the lead through @entity42 ( second left ) in the first half in @entity92 and never looked back @entity42 slotted into the top corner from a set - piece in the ninth minute to extend @entity9 's aggregate advantage @entity125 can not get a game for @entity132 but he is a cornerstone of this @entity9 team and the captain showed his worth with a magnificent instinctive save to thwart @entity25			1
given the delicate balance of this contest , it was a moment of great significance			0
@entity2 had been bolstered by the presence of @entity142 midfielder @entity27 , one of the finest young talents in @entity144			2
he had warmed up for this by playing 30 minutes for @entity2 ’s senior side on monday night against @entity148			1
@entity42 runs away to celebrate his goal having given @entity9 the lead in @entity92 in the second leg of their play - off @entity153 reacts in despair as @entity9 celebrate taking the lead in the second leg in @entity92 @entity9 , however , swiftly got back on an even keel and began passing the ball in the manner @entity16 desires			1
they had willing runners , particularly in the shape of the eye - catching @entity163 , and a belief they could cause @entity2 problems			2
in the eighth minute , a corner that had been won by the tenacity of @entity45 was swung in by @entity47 and met flush on the volley by @entity42 , who jubilantly wheeled away after his shot had hit the roof of @entity2 ’s net			1
@entity42 had silenced the home supporters and given his team the confidence to look for the second goal that would have killed the tie			0
@entity179 winger @entity163 ( right ) battles for the ball with @entity2 's @entity30 ( left ) @entity2 players celebrate after @entity31 brought them level seven minutes before half - time in @entity92 @entity80 's @entity45 evades @entity2 's @entity153 ( left ) as @entity19 manager @entity16 watches on in @entity92 @entity9 's two goalscorers @entity42 ( left ) and @entity45 ( centre ) celebrate helping @entity9 qualify for the @entity186 @entity188 supporters get behind their team in the second leg of their play - off against @entity9 it should have arrived in the 36th minute when @entity45 surged into the area , but seemed reluctant to shoot			1
the ball fell to @entity163 but his effort was straight at keeper @entity20			0
in the next attack , a long ball was hit up field by @entity29 and , as @entity9 ’s defence dithered , @entity31 nipped in to score			2
now @entity27 began to impress			0
one ball he played with outside of his left foot to launch an attack , having not broken his stride , was majestic			0
but half - time gave @entity9 the chance to regroup and they began the second period with a renewed sense of calm			1
this was @entity9 ’s biggest test , but they were passing it with style			0
@entity51 might have won it in the 59th minute but his shot smashed against the post			0
not long after , the outstanding @entity45 waltzed forward and finished with aplomb			0
it was his 13th game and 10th consecutive win			0
and , for @entity16 , it was just about perfect .			0

@entity9 secure place at 2015 @entity13 with play - off win over @entity2
