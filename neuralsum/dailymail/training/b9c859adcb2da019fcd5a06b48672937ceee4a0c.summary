' we do n't have capitalism in this country , ' he said at one point			2
' we have an enormous oligopoly that 's strangling the innovation that happens with small businesses , which is where the genes of @entity18 has really been			2
' @entity2 was in the midst of previewing the @entity3 's bench of potential presidential candidates when he launched into a diatribe on the ramifications of allowing banks to become too big to fail and the importance of @entity28 senator @entity27 's efforts to more strictly regulate @entity18 's financial institutions			1
tell us how you really feel : former @entity31 governor @entity2 gave a scathing critique of @entity18 's economy during a forum today at a progressive conference ' i do n't hate the banks , but the truth of the matter is they are not capitalist organizations			1
they are basically oligopolies , ' @entity2 claimed during his tirade			1
is not that they 're evil and horrible - although we can debate that , ' he said			0
' the problem is they 're so big that if they fail , they have to be bailed out			0
' so it 's not capitalism			0
' @entity2 has publicly criticized the banking industry before , but his remarks in @entity55 , @entity56 , today appear to be the first time the former @entity59 chairman has characterized their practices as anti-free market			2
in past discussions @entity2 has stopped at saying lenders need to be better regulated and banks need to be downsized			2
say , cheese : 11 years after his failed presidential bid , @entity2 is still a favorite speaker of @entity9 - goers while prognosticating on the 2016 presidential election , @entity2 said today that he did n't think @entity68 would run , but ' some of the stuff she 's saying about the banks has absolutely got ta be said			1
' he later claimed that @entity68 ' is actually pro-capitalist because capitalism is hurt more by capitalists than it is by people who oppose capitalism			0
' ' and she articulates this better than anybody i 've seen , ' he said , concluding his remarks on the state of @entity18 's economy			1
' so , i do n't think she 's gon na get in unless @entity84 does n't run , ' he predicted , coming back to the original topic			0
and if that happens , ' i know you guys are going to do everything you can to make sure she gets in whether she likes it our not , ' he said , eliciting laughter and clapping from audience members			0
