a soldier 's neck was broken in three places by his comrade in a brutal murder that may have been a revenge attack after an earlier punch - up , a jury has been told			1
lance corporal @entity7 , 23 , of the @entity8 , is alleged to have ' violently and brutally attacked ' corporal @entity9 , landing blows to his ' head , stomach , and genitals '			1
but @entity14 , prosecuting , said it was ' significant force ' applied to the neck that killed @entity18 , breaking three of his vertebrae			1
corporal @entity9 was ' violently and brutally attacked ' and killed in his barracks room in @entity22 mr @entity23 said dna evidence recovered from the @entity7 's top - including a possible bloodstain - and shoes matched that of @entity18 , while there were three - and - a - half hours where @entity7 's movements could not be accounted for			1
the jury at @entity32 was also told @entity7 went alone to @entity18 's room at about 9.15am later that morning , and apparently then finding him dead , raised the alarm			2
setting out the prosecution case to the trial jury of four women and eight men today , mr @entity23 said : ' at some time between 4am and 6am on the morning of march 8 this year @entity9 was violently and brutally attacked			1
' his attacker inflicted heavy blows to his head , his stomach and his genitals but the ultimate cause of death was pressure to the neck in the form of blows and or some form of neck hold			1
' the force applied to his neck was significant			1
there were fractures to three different bones in the neck of @entity9			1
' we say he was murdered and by murdered i mean this , he was attacked and his attacker caused his injuries unlawfully			1
' the attacker intended at the least to caused @entity9 really serious injury and that he died as a result of those injuries			1
' the murder took place in the room that @entity9 occupied at the barracks			1
the prosecution contention is that the murderer was this defendant @entity7			2
' this murder is no different to a murder committed in a street or a pub or someone â€™s home or indeed anywhere else			2
' @entity18 , 32 , who was born in @entity81 in @entity82 , was found dead in his room at @entity85 's @entity84 on the morning of march 8 , after a night out where he had a fight with his alleged murderer @entity18 , 32 , who was born in @entity81 in @entity82 , was found dead in his room at @entity85 's @entity84 , which is where the @entity89 says the crime took place			1
mr @entity23 said there was ' no history of ill - feeling or animosity ' between him and @entity7 , who served in a different company in the regiment , which was based at the time at the @entity22 barracks			2
the jury heard how the previous evening , on friday march 7 , both men had separately been drinking before heading out to the nearby town of @entity101			1
mr @entity23 described an incident in the town 's @entity104 and @entity105 pub , where an ' annoyed ' @entity7 complained some soldiers were ' acting " like maggots "			2
' later that night , as @entity109 from inside the nearby @entity111 pub showed , @entity18 floored @entity7 with a right hook , cutting his own knuckle and the young lance corporal 's lip in the process			1
witnesses later told how @entity18 had claimed the younger man was ' trapping off ' before he landed the punch			2
@entity7 would also later tell colleagues he had been ' gobbing off ' to the corporal , said mr @entity23			0
the prosecutor said that punch ' could provide an explanation for a later attack carried out by mr @entity7 , as revenge for what had happened '			0
after the fracas , both men left separately , returning to barracks within minutes of each other at about 3am			0
a general view of the @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity22 , home to the @entity133 the @entity8 @entity7 's movements could not be accounted for between his arrival back at base , and 6.30am , when he was discovered asleep on the floor of the guard room			0
the last time @entity18 was seen , he was sitting outside the accommodation block housing his third - floor room on the base just after returning to the barracks			0
between 4am and 4.30am that morning , a soldier whose room was opposite @entity18 's thought he heard ' bumping noises ' and a male voice say ' " @entity148 " , two or three times , ' said mr @entity23			0
that soldier got out of bed but only to lock his door from the inside , and did not look out onto the adjoining corridor to see what was happening			0
mr @entity23 said @entity7 awoke in the base 's guardroom , then went back to his room to shower , washing his clothes at the barracks ' laundry			0
he asked one soldier ' " where 's @entity165 's room ? " - in reference to @entity18 , saying he could n't remember anything , and wanted to apologise , ' added the prosecutor			0
@entity7 got to @entity18 's room at about 9.15am , and said he found the other man lying on the floor in just his underpants			2
' according to @entity7 he made vigorous attempts at resuscitation , and that would have led to a significant transfer of dna , ' said mr @entity23			0
@entity7 would later tell police he squeezed @entity18 's testicles ' to see if he was conscious , as part of @entity181 training he had received ' , he added			0
however the prosecutor told jurors they would hear @entity181 medical experts were ' unaware of that practice '			0
mr @entity23 told jurors that over the course of the trial , they would hear testimony from fellow soldiers , and look at forensics , @entity109 , and mobile phone evidence			0
@entity7 , wearing a smart dark suit and tie and sporting close - cropped dark hair , listened intently from the court dock as the @entity198 set out its case			0
proceedings were adjourned for the day but the trial , expected to last four weeks , continues			0
