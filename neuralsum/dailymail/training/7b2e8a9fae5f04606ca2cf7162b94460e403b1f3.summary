an artist has hit out after her @entity2 profile was shut down because it contained pictures of nude models from her life - drawing class			1
@entity6 , 29 , organised male and female models to come and pose naked at the art lessons she gives in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
but when connecting with her students on @entity2 , she was shocked to see website bosses clamp down on the group 's photos using its strict ' pornography ' rules			1
artist @entity6 had her @entity2 profile shut down and picture 's removed from her art class 's group because nude models pictures in photo breached the website 's ' pornography ' rules it is believed the page was reported to @entity2 technical staff , who closed down ms @entity6 's personal profile and removed several photos from the art group 's forum			1
the @entity10 - based artist said : ' there is nothing remotely pornographic about the pictures			2
' it 's pretty ironic really because life - drawing is one of the oldest art forms			0
there are some pictures with nude models in them but it 's not full frontal and it 's not offensive			0
' ms @entity6 set up the classes , called all the @entity50 , six years ago and their success has led her to take them around @entity53			1
up to 100 artists attend the two - hour weekly @entity10 class in a private room at a city centre pub. ms @entity6 now has plans to licence an evening class in @entity61 , a city she was visiting when she was told her page had been removed earlier this month			0
the art classes are popular with students , who draw nudes in a private room of a pub in the centre of @entity10 but @entity2 say images posted on the group 's page breach their strict rules on ' nudity and pornography ' she added : ' they removed a few pictures but the page is back up again			1
i guess it 's going to be an ongoing thing because life - drawing is all about the nude human form			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said @entity6 's profile was ' temporarily blocked ' for breaching their terms and confirmed that some links were removed for breaking their rules on nudity			1
the spokesman said : ' @entity2 has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content			2
we also impose limitations on the display of nudity			0
' but we aspire to respect people 's right to share content of personal importance , whether those are photos of a sculpture like @entity103 or family photos of a child breastfeeding			0
' ms @entity6 insisted there was ' nothing remotely pornographic ' about the images posted on the group 's page ' graphic or violent content ' : former soldier @entity111 , 37 , who lost both legs and an arm while serving in @entity114 has called @entity2 ' harsh and narrow - minded ' after they removed a picture of one of his stumps because it was ' offensive '			1
the former corporal from @entity121 , @entity122 , posted the picture of his stump with the caption ' hard work on the legs today '			0
but it was taken down by the social media 's site communities team after a user complained about it			0
until october last year , beheading videos were removed by @entity2 but the site changed its policy allowing them to stay online , as long as they were not glorifying the violence and used to raise awareness or condemn the action being shown			1
breaking these guidelines can lead to a lifetime ban			0
' nudity ' : in july , professional photographer @entity142 was suspended from @entity2 after she posted a photograph of her daughter @entity144 , two , on the beach - which the site labelled ' pornographic '			2
a number of website users have said they were treated harshly after posting innocent photos			0
file picture mrs @entity142 , from @entity151 , said that she fell foul of @entity2 's notoriously strict guidelines on posting nude pictures of children after they received a complaint about her innocent recreation of the famous ' @entity159 girl ' pose from the 1950s ad campaign @entity2 has a strict policy against sharing pornography , and any explicit sexual content including a child			1
users who have posted pictures of their children naked or semi-clothed have been banned from the site			0
@entity2 says it does ' aspire to respect people â€™s right to share content of personal importance ' , including pictures of breast feeding , and lifted a blanket ban on such images in june following the high profile ' @entity180 ' campaign			1
' users with false names ' : in the run up to the @entity185 , @entity2 pages set up by anti-austerity protesters , including @entity187 , were disabled			2
however , @entity2 said the profiles were suspended not for political reasons , but because they had not been correctly registered			0
the @entity2 community standards state that ' claiming to be another person , creating a false presence for an organisation , or creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates @entity2 's terms			2

artist set up popular class six years ago and invited naked models to pose
she and her students connected through a @entity2 group set up online
but she was *astonished* to have her profile shut down and pictures removed
@entity2 say the pictures broke its strict terms on nudity and pornography
