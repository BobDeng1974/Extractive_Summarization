published : 15:35 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 3 december 2013 with @entity1 calling for the @entity4 law 's repeal in greater numbers , and even some democrats calling for major changes , president @entity0 stuck to his guns tuesday before a partisan , cheering crowd , insisting that he wo n't agree to ditch the law no matter what			1
looking more like a campaigning candidate than a sitting president , his speech was an attempt to re-boot public interest in the @entity4 while vowing that ' we 're not walking away from it			2
' ' we 're not repealing it as long as i 'm president , ' he insisted defensively as his fans gave him a standing ovation			0
' we will make it work for all @entity26			2
' @entity27 senate minority leader @entity27 fired off a press statement within moments of @entity0 's conclusion			2
' another campaign - style event wo n’t solve the myriad problems facing consumers under @entity4 , ' @entity31 said , claiming that the president 's system ' is broken beyond repair			1
' tarnished halo : president @entity0 was forced to defend his health insurance law in the face of widespread criticism about rate hikes , cancelled policies , limited coverage and a crash - prone website land of second chances ? @entity0 begged @entity26 to give healthcare.gov a second chance , following an online performance that was nothing short of disastrous ' the only " fix , " he added , ' is full repeal followed by step - by - step , patient - centered reforms that drive down costs and that @entity26 actually want			1
' the president 's focus on beating back calls for scrapping his signature legislative achievement follows two months of disastrous performance from the website designed – at enormous public cost – to help @entity26 find new medical insurance			1
@entity0 insisted that , now , ' the website is working well for the vast majority of users			2
' but he hinted at the underlying reality that even as state - and federal - level marketplaces begin to function and enrollment numbers grow , a majority of @entity26 are choosing free @entity74 coverage instead of buying private health insurance			1
' after just the first month , despite all the problems in the rollout , ' @entity0 said tuesday , ' about half a million people across the country are poised to gain coverage through the marketplaces and @entity74			1
' ' that number is going to keep increasing every day			0
' in october , that first month , just 106,200 people enrolled in private health plans through state and federal online marketplaces			0
that leaves approximately 400,000 on @entity74 , which taxpayers fund at no cost to eligible subscribers			2
the @entity91 has estimated that the @entity4 system will need 7 million new private insurance enrollees by the end of march in order to remain solvent			1
among them , the government needs to find more than 2.7 million young people whose relative good health will balance out the higher medical costs of the old and sick			0
mystery panel : @entity0 spoke in front of a group of supportive @entity26 , but the @entity104 did n't say who they are or whether they have purchased @entity4 coverage @entity0 's last live - audience foray into @entity4 defense came on oct. 21 , where his speech came complete with a fainting pregnant woman and a supportive panel -- only a few of whom had enrolled but @entity0 promised to stick with his plan , saying that ' whatever comes up , we 're just going to fix it			1
' ' we 're just getting started with the exchanges , ' he told his audience			0
one attendee was a baby who let out a short yell , and @entity0 improvised			0
' yes , you agree with me , ' he quipped			0
and then @entity26 's insurance - salesman - in - chief tried to close the deal and encourage @entity26 to help him generate interest in the @entity4 's insurance offerings			1
' now that we ... are getting the technology fixed , ' he asked , ' we need you to go back , take a look at what 's actually going on			0
' ' i 'm going to need some help in spreading the word			0
' the @entity137 said tuesday that more than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov on monday , the first weekday following its self - imposed nov. 30 deadline to fix a host of unresolved technology problems			1
sen. @entity31 hopes potential @entity4 participants will remember @entity4 's early headaches instead of cutting the @entity104 any slack			0
loyal opposition : senate minority leader @entity27 continues to call for a total repeal of the @entity4 ' the @entity26 people have been learning about the impact @entity4 will have on individuals and families in the form of higher premiums , disrupted insurance , and lost jobs , ' he said			1
' consumers ... really did n’t need @entity4 ’s cancellation of millions of plans that people already have and like in order to provide help to those with preexisting conditions			0
' the president was introduced by @entity167 , a young woman who praised the president for enacting a law that allowed her to remain covered through her parents ' insurance until she turned 26			0
@entity0 hosted a similar event in oct. 21 in which a fan of his health insurance overhaul plan introduced him before a brief @entity176 speech			1
but unlike that event , the @entity104 did not distribute a list tuesday of the people who stood behind the president as he spoke on - stage			0
@entity181 revealed that only three of the 13 people appearing during the oct. 21 event had actually enrolled in the @entity4 system .			2

@entity0 continues to draw attention to @entity1 ' demands for a complete repeal of his signature medical insurance reform law
he claims more than a half - million have become insured because of @entity4 , but four - *fifths* of them have chosen taxpayer - funded @entity74
@entity199 @entity1 blasts ' campaign - style event ' and says the @entity4 is ' broken beyond repair '
@entity0 promises to stay the course , begging @entity26 to give healthcare.gov a second chance
