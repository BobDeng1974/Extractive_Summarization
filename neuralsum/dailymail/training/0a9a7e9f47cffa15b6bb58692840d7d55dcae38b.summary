it 's been one hell of a rollercoaster year for @entity2 , who started the year hopelessly with one manager and end it somewhat optimistically with another			1
kicking off 2014 with @entity6 and @entity7 elimination , @entity9 ' six - year contract as boss at @entity11 was continually questioned as @entity2 looked a shadow of their former selves under sir @entity16 's compatriot replacement			1
following @entity18 ' sacking in april @entity2 appear to be revitalised under former @entity20 manager @entity19 , who joined in the summer and broke the @entity22 transfer record with the signing of @entity24			1
@entity25 reviews the year for @entity2			2
@entity9 started the year under a dark cloud as he struggled as sir @entity16 's successor january a month that very much set the tone for the rest of @entity9 ’ doomed reign saw @entity2 crash out of the @entity6 ( losing to @entity33 at @entity11 at the first hurdle ) and the @entity7 ( losing on penalties against @entity36 )			1
a humbling 3 - 1 defeat against @entity38 in the middle of the month left the reigning champions 14 points behind @entity43 leaders @entity44			0
the £ 37.1million signing of @entity46 from @entity38 , however , did provide some cause for optimism			0
despite a poor run in form @entity9 dipped into the january transfer market by signing @entity46 from @entity38 february despite the addition of @entity46 , @entity2 still could not click into top gear and managed a single win – a 2 - 0 victory at @entity57 against @entity58			1
@entity2 ’s struggles were best summed up in the 2 - 2 home draw against @entity61 , which saw @entity62 score in ‘ @entity63 ’ for the visitors – a sign that @entity11 was no longer the fortress of old			1
amazingly , @entity9 ’ side put in 81 crosses during the game , with @entity61 ’s @entity70 saying afterward : ‘ i ’ve ( not ) headed that many balls since the @entity72 ! ’ on the plus side , @entity73 ended speculation over his future by signing a new five - and - a - half - year contract			1
@entity46 's inclusion failed to inject much impetus into the flailing @entity2 squad as they drew to @entity61 @entity2 did have some positive news to tell fans as @entity73 signed a new contract at @entity11 @entity84 two successive 3 - 0 home defeats against @entity86 and @entity87 piled the pressure on @entity9			1
a 3 - 0 victory over @entity90 secured @entity2 ’s place in the @entity93 quarter finals , but the atmosphere around certain sections of @entity11 seemed to be growing more toxic			1
@entity97 ’s substitution during the @entity99 derby was greeted with loud applause and during the next home game , a 4 - 1 victory over @entity103 , a plane carrying an @entity106 banner flew over the ground – though it was booed by the large sections of the home fans			0
@entity2 ended the month 15 points off leaders @entity38 and 10 behind @entity44 in fourth			0
@entity112 in @entity9 hit an all - time low when a seemingly clueless @entity2 side fell at home to rivals @entity86 certain fans at @entity11 grew frustrated with @entity9 as @entity2 also lost 3 - 0 to neighbours @entity87 @entity117 ( left ) and @entity118 ( right ) celebrate goals in @entity87 's convincing victory at @entity11 in march @entity121 after just 10 months in job , @entity9 – who was given a six - year contract after replacing sir @entity16 – was sacked			1
ironically the nail in the coffin was delivered by his former club @entity126 who eased to a comfortable 2 - 0 win on the @entity130 ’s first return to @entity131			0
earlier in the month , @entity2 crashed out of the @entity93 as they were beaten 3 - 1 ( 4 - 2 on agg ) by @entity134 , despite taking a surprise lead in the @entity136 through @entity137			1
@entity138 took over as interim manager and started his reign with a thumping 4 - 0 home win over @entity142			2
by april it was decided that enough was enough and @entity9 was sacked as @entity2 manager @entity144 legend @entity138 was appointed as interim manager , winning his first game by thrashing @entity142 may the euphoria of the @entity138 era – which also saw former class of ’ 92 members @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 take prominent roles on the coaching staff – was punctured by a 1 - 0 home defeat to @entity36			1
in what proved to be @entity138 ’ farewell game at @entity11 – a 3 - 1 win over @entity162 – there were debuts for youngsters @entity164 and @entity166			0
a 1 - 1 draw with @entity168 on the final day saw @entity2 finish 22 points behind champions @entity87 in seventh – their worst @entity43 finish			2
eight days after the season finished , @entity19 was appointed as manager with @entity138 as his assistant			1
in may the @entity43 title was painfully handed back over to the blue side of @entity99 june with the @entity43 over all eyes were on the @entity177 and @entity178 ’s @entity20 to see what lay ahead at @entity11			2
back in @entity99 , chief executive @entity180 , under pressure after a botched summer 12 months earlier , swung into action as @entity2 announced the signings of @entity184 for £ 29m from @entity185 and @entity186 from @entity168 for £ 30m			0
@entity187 became the first casualty of the new era , leaving for @entity190 as speculation grew as to how @entity178 would transform his squad			0
@entity2 chief @entity180 began the spending spree by bringing in @entity186 ( left ) and @entity184 ( right ) july with the @entity177 over , @entity178 arrived for his first day of work at @entity195 on the 16th			1
by this point stalwarts @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity137 , as well as a number of fringe players , had left and @entity2 were being linked with a who ’s who of football : @entity203 , @entity204 and even @entity205			0
the @entity207 ’s first press conference will be remembered for his plea that it will take three months for his new squad to understand his philosophy			0
but @entity178 ’s first game was a thumping 7 - 0 friendly win over @entity213 and was followed by victories over @entity215 and @entity216			0
july said goodbye to @entity2 defensive stalwarts @entity197 ( top ) and @entity198 left back @entity137 was another experienced player to leave @entity11 , joining @entity219 in july @entity19 returned from the @entity177 after his @entity20 side reached the semi-finals of the competition august @entity2 ’s impressive pre-season form continued with victories over @entity225 , @entity86 and @entity226			1
the new era was well and truly under way as @entity2 lined up in an unfamiliar 3 - 5 - 2 formation and @entity73 was appointed the club ’s new captain			1
optimism abounded after such an impressive pre-season , but the mood quickly changed as @entity33 ruined the party on the opening day of the season , winning 2 - 1 at @entity11 in @entity178 ’s first competitive game in charge			0
two league draws against @entity241 and @entity36 followed , as well as a humbling 4 - 0 defeat in the @entity7 to @entity243			2
@entity2 again dipped into the transfer market , adding @entity246 duo @entity245 and @entity24 for a combined £ 66m			0
@entity2 's pre-season started well with a win over @entity225 in front of 109,318 fans at the @entity251 @entity178 continued the spending by bringing in @entity245 ( left ) and @entity24 for a combined £ 66million september september started with a bang as @entity254 arrived on loan from @entity256 and @entity257 signed for £ 14m from @entity258 – taking @entity2 ’s summer spending to £ 160m - but academy product @entity261 was sold to rivals @entity44			1
at the fourth time of asking , @entity178 finally got his first win as @entity2 thumped @entity265 4 - 0 at @entity11			2
a week later , however , they were embarrassed again as they lost 5 - 3 to @entity268 – squandering a 3 - 1 lead			0
@entity2 ’s injury worries continued as @entity178 was forced to turn to youngsters @entity271 and @entity273 in the absence of @entity186 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277			0
star signing @entity254 and @entity207 @entity177 star @entity257 also joined the @entity2 ranks in september @entity268 brought @entity2 back down to earth after coming back from 3 - 1 down to win the game 5 - 3 october with no @entity284 or @entity7 football , @entity2 only played three times in october , stealing last - minute points against @entity287 and @entity38 after beating @entity126 at home – a game notable for @entity254 scoring his first goal for the club			1
after nine games , @entity178 ’s side sat ninth with 13 points – one fewer than @entity9 had at the same stage the season before			2
october marked @entity254 's first goal for the @entity298 with this finish to beat former @entity2 goalkeeper @entity300 november defeat in the @entity99 derby – courtesy of a @entity304 strike and a first - half @entity277 red card - meant it was @entity2 ’s worst start to a season since 1986			2
level on points with @entity287 and @entity310 , @entity178 ’s side were already 13 points behind league leaders @entity38			0
but three wins on the bounce against @entity58 , @entity44 and @entity162 lifted @entity2 into the @entity93 places			0
two clean sheets in four games were a welcome boost after @entity2 ’s defence had been so porous earlier in the season			0
more questions began to be asked about the @entity2 back line when @entity277 saw red against @entity87 @entity304 scored the only goal of the day as @entity2 's city rivals took the lead just after the hour mark december @entity2 ’s good form extended into the @entity329 period with wins over @entity331 , @entity168 , @entity86 and @entity310 and draws at @entity103 and @entity332 – meaning @entity2 finished 2014 on a nine - game unbeaten run			1
the upturn in form had sparked talk of a title a challenge – notably from senior players such as @entity73 and @entity341 – but @entity178 ’s side were still 10 points behind league leaders @entity38 and just three points ahead of @entity168 and @entity44 in fourth and fifth			0
with the january transfer window set to open , @entity2 were again being linked with big money moves – notably a £ 120m move for @entity348			0
after an eventful year @entity2 have again been linked to big money signings - is the future red for @entity348 ?			2

@entity2 started 2014 badly with @entity6 and @entity7 elimination
by @entity354 made the *decision* to sack struggling manager @entity9
@entity19 was appointed as club manager following the @entity177
the @entity207 has *created* a new - look side since taking over in charge
