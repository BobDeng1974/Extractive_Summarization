while much of the @entity0 is coated in snow , spare a thought for the crew of the @entity4 – @entity7 @entity6 research station in @entity8			1
they are about to be ' locked in ' - and will have to survive six months of complete isolation			2
to make things worse , four months will be in darkness because the @entity13 never rises above the horizon			0
called @entity16 , it is made up of four - legged modules linked by enclosed walkways			1
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year			1
a central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room , bar and a gym			0

a central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room , bar and a gym			0
a vacuum drainage system keeps water consumption down , and the ski - clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres ( 13 feet ) above the level of the ice			1
the inside of the centre has been been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter , when temperatures at the base drop as low as -56c			1
it has triple - glazed windows and a quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to contemplate the @entity8 environment in peace			1
this year , @entity62 - sponsored medical doctor @entity61 will monitor five experiments that are helping to prepare for long - duration missions to explore our @entity65			2
' living in @entity67 is similar in many ways to living in space , where crew are cut off from the world without normal sunlight and live in reduced pressure – concordia station lies 3200 m above sea level , ' says the @entity62			2
' from searching for life that could survive in these extreme conditions to monitoring how the crew of 13 interact and cope with living in close quarters , @entity61 will have her hands full as the crew maintain the station and perform @entity8 science for the @entity4 and @entity7 polar institutes			2
' @entity62 signed an agreement this month with the @entity86 to perform two of the five @entity67 experiments at their @entity90 station			2
if this pilot season runs well , @entity62 will extend the cooperation			0
@entity67 offers @entity62 scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes			0
the crew at @entity6 experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level			2
performing the same investigations at @entity6 will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data : air pressure			0
over the next six months , volunteers at @entity6 and @entity67 will record themselves in a video diary and have their social interactions monitored			0
this is working towards objective computer software that will give clues to an astronaut ’s state of mind			0
the @entity16 centre , a dismantlable research station created for the @entity86 by @entity120 architects @entity121 , was nominated for the @entity122 2013 ask anybody how they feel and most will reply ‘ fine ’ but , for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking , having an objective second - opinion could be a lifesaver			1
the system works by analysing small changes in intonation and grammar , as well as charting how often people talk to each other , to develop an idea of how people feel			0
the second experiment being run at both sites will test how our eyes adapt to four months of outside darkness and artificial lighting			0
@entity67 sunset @entity145 , @entity86 ’s director of science , concludes : “ we are committed to supporting excellent science in @entity8 in all disciplines			0
we are hugely excited to be hosting these new experiments that may help prepare for , perhaps , the biggest adventure in history , a manned flight to @entity152			0

during winter the @entity13 stays below the horizon for around four months			0
a skeleton crew of up to 15 to keep the base running and fend for themselves for nine months			1
it was built solely for purpose , to enable scientists to live comfortably as they carry out vital research work in the freezing cold @entity8			0
but thanks to its strikingly futuristic appearance , the @entity16 centre has been causing quite a stir in architectural circles , and it has now been nominated for a prestigious global award			1
in a textbook example of form following function , @entity120 architect firm @entity121 created the series of four - legged pods , seven of them blue and one red , which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up			1
the @entity16 centre consists of series of four - legged pods which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up the dismantlable research station , which few fans of design will ever get to see unless they venture to the @entity8 wilderness , is among the nominees for the @entity122 2013			1
@entity16 is the sixth facility to occupy the site on the @entity197 - a floating sheet of ice about 10 miles ( 16 kilometres ) from the edge of the @entity201			1
most of the previous stations were crushed under the weight of the polar snow , while @entity206 had to be abandoned due to fears that the station would be lost if the ice sheet split apart , said survey spokesman @entity210			1
solitude : @entity8 is the most isolated place on @entity213 - but its remote location means the scientists have been able to see the stunning aurora australis home from home : the modules include house labs , a dining room , a bar and a gym linked : the scientists do not need to go outside to move between modules as they will be joined together by walkways			0

the futuristic - looking @entity16 centre , was designed by @entity120 architect firm @entity121
consists of a series of four - legged pods which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow
during winter a skeleton crew of 15 remain on the station , and must fend for themselves as *aircraft* can not visit
