@entity0 hit an unbeaten 110 as @entity1 defeated @entity2 by six - wickets to ensure they finished the group stages unbeaten			1
earlier , @entity5 had hit an impressive 138 in his final match for @entity2 before moving to @entity7 to play for county side @entity8 as a @entity11 player			1
however , the 29 - year - old was denied a fairytale ending by @entity0 and @entity14 as the reigning champions were pushed hard to ensure they kept up their winning momentum			2
@entity0 of @entity1 celebrates after scoring a century during @entity1 's victory against @entity2 on saturday @entity0 waves his bat in celebration as captain @entity20 congratulates his team - mate despite being an emotional day for @entity5 , who had spoken about his sadness at leaving the international stage , he became the first @entity25 player ever to hit back - to - back @entity28 centuries			1
and , on a record - breaking day @entity5 passed his mentor @entity29 for the most one - day international hundreds scored with his eighth ton			1
for @entity1 , they passed their first real test as they stretched their @entity28 winning streak to 10 – behind only @entity36 on 25			2
on a green wicket , batting first always seemed like the ideal option but having won the @entity39 said he wanted his side to be tested and face a chase , so chose to bowl			0
it seemed unlikely that @entity20 was going to be granted his wish as his consistently impressive trio of fast bowlers , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , each took an early wicket to reduce @entity2 to 33 - 3			2
plenty of supporters were still finding their way into @entity55 when a fuller @entity48 delivery caught the outside edge of @entity59 ’s bat ( 2 ) and @entity60 took a low catch behind the stumps			0
@entity0 's unbeaten 110 earned him the @entity63 as @entity1 kept up 100 per cent record @entity2 skipper @entity5 hit an impressive 138 in his final international match six balls later @entity66 ( 7 ) followed his fellow opener back into the hut as he sent a thick edge into the hand of @entity72 in the slips off the bowling of @entity75			1
and when @entity76 was caught behind off @entity49 for a turgid nine from 22 - balls , @entity2 looked to be buckling against the world champions			0
however , it arguably brought @entity2 ’s two best batsmen , @entity5 and @entity80 , to the crease and together they rebuilt their side ’s innings			1
the pair shared a 93 - run fourth wicket partnership as both batsman battled against each other to reach their half - centuries first , with the chase won by captain @entity5			0
@entity80 ( 50 ) followed suit the very next ball but then fell tamely has he attempted to whack the ball hard past bowler @entity93 only to be caught sharply by the spinner			0
@entity5 though was n’t willing to leave the international stage without a personal milestone and he found a willing partner in @entity98 to help him to his ton			2
@entity5 takes his helmet off as he celebrates his second successive century as the wicketkeeper - batsman passed 73 he became the highest @entity25 run - maker in a @entity28 , surpassing @entity103 ’s 367 in 1999 , finally finishing with 405 runs for the campaign			0
and , after reaching the all - important three figures @entity5 exploded , smashing one @entity107 over for 24 runs			0
however , he departed in the next over as he lofted the ball to @entity72 at mid-off off @entity49 for an impressive 138 off 110 balls			0
congratulated by many of the @entity114 players , @entity5 walked off to a standing ovation by the 30,000 strong crowd			0
@entity2 ’s progress could easily have been stunted by their loss of regular wickets but their deep batting line - up continued to impress as they regularly cleared the ropes			2
@entity1 ’s spinners , @entity93 and @entity107 , who were seen @entity127 as their main bowling threat , disappeared for a collective 1 - 146 from their 20 overs			0
@entity5 is congratulated by @entity1 batsman @entity0 - who would go on to win the match for the champions a quick - fire 28 from @entity132 helped propel @entity2 to 287 all out but @entity1 ’s supposedly weak bowling line - up bowled out their sixth side in six matches			1
buoyed by @entity5 ’s exceptional innings @entity2 strode confidently out on to the field after the innings break			1
despite @entity140 ’s first over going for nine runs @entity1 struggled to get the ball away early on			0
the pressure of tight bowling and a build - up of dot balls saw the dangerous @entity147 ( 16 ) attempt to drive a length ball from the right - arm bowler only to be caught by a back - pedaling @entity132 at cover			0
@entity72 departed just four balls later as @entity140 ’s shattered his stumps to silence the shocked crowd , to give the bowler a double - wicket maiden			0
@entity2 have conceded on average just 3.25 runs in the first powerplay , the lowest of all 14 teams , and @entity1 struggled to 35 - 2 at the end of 10 overs			1
@entity20 embraces century - scorer @entity0 as @entity1 made it 10 wins in a row in @entity28 matches with their side struggling @entity165 and @entity166 shared a 50 - run partnership before the latter was run - out as he attempted to test fielder at cover and failed			1
@entity2 were all over @entity1 and reduced them 92 - 4 as @entity165 attempted to sweep @entity174 round the corner and was bowled for 38			1
with the run - rate creeping up @entity0 and @entity14 continued to find it hard to get the ball away but the turning point in match came when @entity0 was dropped by @entity59 on 47			2
it was a hugely costly error as the - 28 - year - old went on to score his hundred off just 94 balls , having hit seven fours and four sixes			0
and , for the ninth one - day international match of his career @entity20 ( 77 not out ) ended the match by sending the ball clear past the ropes for six with eight balls remaining			1
admittedly it was a disappointing end for @entity2 , who ’s future once again looks unclear with the lost of one of their greatest players , whilst @entity1 ’s march towards a second consecutive @entity28 title continues at pace .			1
