' this soldier knew what he was doing , ' added @entity82 , 25 , who also served in @entity4 's unit			2
he willingly and premeditatedly deserted his comrades			2
' ' and he put his team , his squad , his platoon , his company , and thousands of other @entity91 soldiers in @entity10 at a very high risk trying to find him			0
' it 's statements like those that the @entity12 appears eager to discredit as it scrambles to quell concerns – both among the general public and members of @entity100 – about a deal to trade five high - ranking @entity29 terrorists for @entity4 's safe return on saturday			1
a @entity40 deputy spokeswoman joined in the fray tuesday , suggesting that the @entity108 native 's onetime brothers - in - arms are n't telling the whole story			1

' there are conflicting reports out there about this , ' she said			2
' are there ? ' asked a @entity70 producer			0
go @entity36 it on the web and you ’ll find a ton of conflicting reports , ' @entity39 replied			1
' the fact is we ’re still establishing a fact pattern about what happened , how he ended up in @entity29 captivity			0
' ' i think people need to be really careful about believing every second or third - hand report out there , ' she added – in a direct slam on @entity153 , @entity154 and the other eyewitnesses who have stepped forward			0
challenged about ' his squad mates who served with him overseas said he walked off the [ base ] , @entity39 took exception and insisted that ' there ’s a lot of rumor and " telephone " game that ’s being played here about what happened			0
' ' he ’s been in captivity , ' she scolded			0
' i think he ’s probably the person who knows best what happened on that night			0
' ' but – well , i think that his squad mates have the best indication what happened that night , ' the producer responded			0
' i do n’t think that that ’s the case , ' came @entity39 's retort			0
three more members of @entity4 's platoon spoke to the @entity179 on wednesday , saying they , too , believe he is a wartime @entity3 deserter			1
@entity4 , the unit 's medic recalled thinking at the time , was ' that one guy that wanted to disappear , and now he 's gotten his wish			2

' go @entity36 it on the web , ' she told *journalists* at a daily briefing
nearly a dozen members of @entity4 's platoon have now *accused* him of deserting them , creating a *scenario* that the @entity12 did n't anticipate
