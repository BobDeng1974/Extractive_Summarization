it was her own difficult childhood which proved to her that so - called ‘ attachment parenting ’ was the way to bring up children			1

@entity1 called the aftermath of the divorce , in 1996 , when she was seven , as ‘ really unstable ’			2
besotted : peaches and husband @entity121 enjoying an afternoon at the park with their two sons @entity27 and @entity28 in july 2013 the difficulties were compounded when she was told , aged 13 , that she suffered from polycystic ovaries and was unlikely to have children			2

’ her husband , she said , was in tears and her love for her son was instant and intense			0
‘ i knew then i 'd been destined to be a mother , it 's just my baby was waiting for the right time , the time i was ready , too			0
’ peaches said that her next pregnancy was accidental – she had not realised it was possible to conceive while breastfeeding – but no less welcome			0
a result of the age difference of just a year between her sons , and her desire for ‘ attachment parenting ’ – which has also been advocated by @entity201 – was exhaustion			1

the phrase was initially coined by @entity240 paediatrician @entity239 in 2001 , and recommends practices such as co-sleeping , carrying a baby close in a sling and breastfeeding into toddlerhood , or until the child weans naturally			0
the concept has since been embraced by a number of celebrity mothers including @entity250 and @entity252 ’s @entity251			0

peaches and @entity257 went head to head in a debate about attachment parenting on this morning she said : ‘ all it is is a return to instinctive parenting			1
i follow the @entity266 of attachment parenting - birth bonding , breastfeeding , babywearing , bedding close to baby , belief in the language value of your baby ’s cry , beware of baby trainers and balance			1
’ she explained that the principles can be as strict or relaxed as one likes , and her routine with @entity27 , 23 months , and @entity28 , 10 months , include ‘ a loose feeding schedule ’ but ‘ really strict bedtime ’			2
when questioned about how the co-sleeping arrangement affects her sex life , @entity1 responded : ' i have two babies under two so obviously i am doing something in the bedroom			0
' just because i sleep in bed with my babies does n't mean i 'm in bed with them 24/7			0
' they go to bed at 7 , but i do n't go to bed at 7			0
