' it had got to the stage before when i had to think about the consequences for my family			0
i very much feel it has saved my life			0
' the turning point for me was in the summer of 2013 when i saw a picture of myself with a huge beer gut			0
' it convinced me to start losing weight and every time i did n't feel like going to the gym i 'd look at it and it would make me even more determined			0
