by @entity0 @entity2 's experts have been noticing a remarkable phenomenon – some of their patients have developed impressive creative talents			1
the link between @entity2 ’s and artistic abilities was brought to the attention of the world two years ago by professor @entity11 of @entity12 in @entity13			1
now she has completed the first empirical study to verify a link between parkinson ’s disease and creativity , which the study suggests may be down to drugs used to treat the disease			2
@entity2 's experts have been noticing a remarkable phenomenon – some of their patients have developed impressive creative talents professor @entity11 first noticed the trend in her own @entity25 clinic when the usual holiday presents from patients - typically chocolates or similar gifts took a surprising turn			1
‘ instead , patients starting bringing us art they had made themselves , ’ she said			0
bringing together case studies from around the world , professor @entity11 examined the details of each patient to uncover a common underlying factor – all were being treated by similar drugs			1
drugs to increase the activity of dopamine in the brain are taken to help treat motor symptoms in @entity2 ’s patients such as tremors and muscle rigidity ( left )			1
this can also increase a patient 's creative powers			0
on the right is a painting by one of professor @entity11 's patients these were either synthetic precursors of dopamine or dopamine receptor agonists , which increase the amount of dopamine activity in the brain			1
@entity2 ’s is a degenerative condition that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die , causing a lack of the chemical dopamine ; this , in turn , interferes with movement and co-ordination			1
when @entity70 was diagnosed with @entity2 ’s , one of the few positive things that seemed to come out of it was a new burst of creativity			1
while previously the closest she ’d come to being an artist was face - painting children at fetes , two years ago - a few months after starting a new medication - she had a burning desire to paint			0
suddenly , art dominated her life ; she produced thousands of canvases - some 2,000 in the past 18 months alone - and exhibited near her home in @entity85			0
like many other @entity2 ’s sufferers , @entity70 ’s obsessive behaviour was a side - effect of her medication			2
for @entity70 , 48 , her obsession has come at a high cost			0
while she held down a job as a nursery nurse , she started spending up to 12 hours a day working on her pictures			0
but while hers was expressed creatively , there have been other examples of @entity2 ’s patients developing more troubling behaviour , such as gambling or sex addictions			2
those affected find themselves trapped in an almost impossible situation : their compulsions are caused by medication , but they ca n’t stop taking it because it would leave them unable to function physically			0
while the cause is not clear it ’s thought genetic and environmental factors , such as exposure to pesticides and herbicides , may play a part , although this has not been proven			0
drugs to increase the activity of dopamine in the brain are taken to help treat motor symptoms in @entity2 ’s patients such as tremors and muscle rigidity			1
but it 's also involved in the brain 's ‘ reward system ’ – the area professor @entity11 predicts is associated with increasing creativity			1
dopamine and artistry have long been connected , she points out , citing the example of the @entity136 , who suffered from psychosis			0
it 's possible that his creativity was the result of this psychosis , thought to be caused by a spontaneous spiking of dopamine levels in the brain			0
there are seemingly no limits to the types of artistic work for which patients develop talents , observes professor @entity11			2
cases include an architect who began to draw and paint human figures after treatment , and a patient who , after treatment , became a prize - winning poet though he had never been involved in the arts before			0
it 's possible that these patients are expressing latent talents they never had the courage to demonstrate before , she suggests			0
professor @entity11 ’s latest research , which looks at clear evidence that creativity might be due to obsessive tendencies , was published this week in the journal @entity170			1
according to @entity171 writing in the @entity172 , professor @entity11 concluded there was no relationship between the creativity she had been noticing and any degree of compulsive behaviour			2
the patients with @entity2 did significantly better than their unafflicted peers in terms of verbal and visual creativity and novel thinking			2
‘ these results support a genuine change in neuropsychological processes underlying creativity , ’ the @entity170 study concluded			0
professor @entity11 of @entity12 has completed the first empirical study to verify a link between parkinson ’s disease and creativity , which the study suggests may be down to drugs used to treat the disease			1

@entity12 has confirmed link between @entity2 ’s and creativity
professor @entity11 first noticed trend in creative gifts from her patients
she found each patient had a common underlying factor – all were being treated by similar drugs to increase dopamine activity in the brain
