by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 18:23 est , 24 january 2014 @entity2 have announced they have reached an agreement with @entity4 to sign @entity5 - click here for full story			1
@entity8 said it was tuesday morning , two days after watching his team thump @entity2 and effectively end their title defence , that he first received indication @entity5 might be leaving			1
@entity8 spent more than an hour on friday patiently explaining the reasons why a £ 37million bid from @entity2 had been accepted for @entity5 , darling of the @entity17 fans			1
there were several strands : there was what he called the human factor , that @entity5 did not specifically ask to go but a player of his quality can not be expected to sit happily on the bench , only to be summoned for games like sunday 's @entity28 tie against @entity29			1
‘ this club care about people , ’ he said			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity8 's press conference as he discusses @entity5 sale serious : @entity8 said that the club ' cared about people ' , that 's why @entity5 was allowed to leave waving goodbye : @entity5 will join @entity2 , subject to agreeing terms and passing a medical there was the enormous fee , a record paid by @entity2			1
‘ @entity4 sold a player for almost double and that ’s fantastic , ’ stressed @entity8			1
they would have listened to similar offers from any club , he said , but knew @entity2 appealed to @entity5			1
the @entity4 manager was not , he insisted , afraid the sale might haunt him			2
‘ no fears at all , ’ he said			0
‘ we are convinced he is going to do well			0
nobody here is jumping because @entity5 is leaving			2
’ @entity8 saluted the attitude of the @entity58 schemer , who has started only half of @entity4 ’s games in the @entity62 in a @entity63 season yet conducted himself superbly			1
adamant : @entity8 insisted he had ' no fears at all ' that selling @entity5 would come back to haunt him underlying it all , however , was the feeling january has turned into a big month in the evolution of @entity8 ’s new side			1
out have gone @entity5 and @entity69 , with @entity70 and possibly @entity71 sent on loan			2
in have come @entity73 , a strong and athletic central midfielder , and @entity75 , a quick and industrious counter-attacking winger			0
both fit snugly into an archetypal @entity8 team			2
@entity4 have no issue with the controversy surrounding @entity75 ’s refusal to shake hands with @entity83 team @entity82 in a @entity85 qualifier last year			2
‘ people have the right to be who they are , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ we are ready to help him			0
’ controversy : new @entity4 signing @entity90 refused to shake @entity82 players ' hands in both @entity85 qualifiers last year , instead using his fist no worries : but @entity8 said there was no issue , insisting they would help the player the @entity4 manager , fired by @entity101 in september 2007 after months of bickering about player recruitment , seems to have found , for the time being at least , a happy understanding with the owner			1
like the fans , @entity101 also adores @entity5 , perhaps the individual who symbolises the efforts to impose a more artistic and creative brand of football on @entity4			1
by selling to @entity2 , he has not only backed @entity8 ’s short - term judgment and but also his ability to construct a better team than @entity115 over time			1
‘ he ’s the boss , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ i belong to the board			0
i give opinions and i justify my opinions			0
we all have an opinion			0
everybody knows where they ’re experts and where they ’re not			0
i am only an expert in football … and only when i win			0
‘ we analyse everything in every perspective			0
from an economic point of view , it was a fantastic offer			2
from a scouting point of view , we could immediately identify two or three who could replace him — not direct replacement because @entity5 is @entity5 , a champion			2
@entity132 : the move for @entity75 represents a step in a different direction for @entity4 , even though boss @entity101 adored @entity5 i 'm yours : @entity8 said that he belonged to the board , and that they were all working together for the best of the club ‘ purely as a football decision , i prefer to keep @entity5 because he can help us achieve important objectives			1
but we shared our opinions and i ’m comfortable with that			0
we can not sell for £ 50m and buy for £ 48m			0
we have to sell for £ 20m and buy for £ 5m			0
‘ this is the kind of situation discussed by a group with different philosophies but a common interest : what is the best for @entity4 ? ’ @entity73 and @entity75 are not eligible for the @entity85 but @entity8 claimed the evolution of his team was too important to prefer to a player less suitable in the long run but eligible for @entity157			1
‘ we are prioritising the evolution of the team , the future of the team , ’ he said			0
‘ the most important thing is we build the right squad , choose the right player , try and complete the puzzle in the next summer or two transfer windows			0
we do n’t want to complete the puzzle in five windows , in december 2018			0
’ new model : @entity170 ( left ) and @entity171 are n't getting any younger and their contracts exprire soon unsettled : @entity8 did n't think @entity5 's departure would open a door for @entity2 forward @entity176 key to the evolution is the recruitment of more @entity180 players to fulfil the home - grown quotas in the @entity62 and @entity157 squad lists , especially at a time when @entity185 , @entity171 and @entity170 soon to be out of contract			1
asked if the @entity5 transfer might help him sign @entity176 , @entity8 replied ‘ i do n’t think so			1
’ but he has young @entity180 players @entity189 and @entity190 in his sights , too			1
in this new era of give and take , the @entity4 manager has accepted the club policy that @entity185 , @entity171 and @entity170 will , like all over 30s , be offered one - year contract extensions			1
it means they risk losing the trio to more attractive offers			0
the future ? @entity203 youngsters @entity190 ( left ) and @entity189 are looked at as long - term investments end of the road ? @entity185 's future in doubt ... but @entity8 still has faith in the centre - half but @entity8 said : ‘ the rule is the rule and it is no problem if you live in a climate of trust			1
if you do n’t , you can leave the player wondering “ is this my last year ? ” or the club asking “ is the player running to another club ? ” ’ @entity8 said he wanted to keep @entity185 and added : ‘ i trust him and i think he trusts me			1
i know where we want to arrive			0
until january 31 , we have lots to think about and to do			0
after that , in a calm way , we are going to analyse			0
the players know what we feel			0

@entity8 says @entity101 and himself worked together over selling @entity5
they came to the decision with the best interests of the club at heart
@entity2 's offer was ' fantastic ' for @entity4
@entity190 and @entity189 are targeted as future , though no update on @entity176
@entity171 , @entity170 and @entity185 could leave in the near future
