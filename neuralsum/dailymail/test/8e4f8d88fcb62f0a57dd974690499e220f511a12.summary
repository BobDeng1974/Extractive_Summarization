at least 15 @entity2 companies , many of them worth north of a $ 1 billion , paid zero income taxes in 2014 , says a report out last week from the @entity7			1
according to the report , household names like @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 all successfully manipulated the @entity14 tax code to avoid paying taxes on their massive profits			1
even more shocking : some of them even received tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions			1
avoidance : fifteen @entity2 companies managed to get through 2014 without owing a penny in income taxes			2
what 's more , most of those 15 were actually given federal tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions @entity9 made $ 1.8 billion in @entity14 profits last year and received a $ 235 million tax rebate to put this harsh reality into perspective , imagine you 're a taxpayer logged on to a tax site in your struggle to determine what you owe @entity36			1
you pay upwards of $ 100 every month for the internet you 're using and could well owe thousands in income tax			0
but if your monthly internet payment goes to @entity41 , guess what they 'll be paying this year			1
that 's right : zero dollars			0
in a way , you may have paid them			0
the frequently maligned cable company made over $ 4 billion in @entity14 profit last year and subsequently received tax rebates totaling $ 26 million			1
and , as @entity51 notes , it 's all perfectly legal			0
one method used by these companies is called accelerated depreciation , which means the tax value of an asset may be claimed in the first years of the purchase rather than over time			2
another method of tax avoidance is active financing			0
put simply , this means a company classifies a taxable activity as foreign financing , putting it out of reach of the @entity66			0
with corporate giants like @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 all successfully avoiding paying income tax , @entity7 says @entity14 taxpayers and the @entity14 government need to wake up and amend the tax code			1
the report 's authors write : ' as @entity78 focuses on strategies for revamping the @entity14 corporate income tax , a sensible starting point should be to critically assess the costs of each of these tax breaks and to take steps to ensure that profitable corporations pay their fair share of @entity14 taxes			2
' fair ? @entity7 wants changes to the corporate tax code and released a report last week that lists the @entity2 corporations that managed to squeak by in 2014 without paying a dime in income tax @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 used accelerated depreciation , a tax break that allows companies to write off the cost of their capital investments much faster than these investments wear out , to dramatically reduce their tax rates @entity106 relied heavily on a single tax break — writing off the value of executive stock options for tax purposes — to zero out its tax liability not just in 2014 but in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 as well			1
in addition , the company admits that this tax break could offset all taxes on up to $ 1.2 billion in profits going forward			0
@entity11 also reports enjoying $ 140 million in stock option tax breaks over the past five years			1
@entity119 has enjoyed more than $ 290 million in research and development tax breaks over the past three years			0
the r&e tax credit has been criticized for rewarding companies for “ research ” they would have done anyway , as well as rewarding research in areas such as fast - food packaging			2
@entity10 uses the active financing tax break as one of many ways that it eliminates its @entity14 income tax bill			0
this arcane tax break allows some multinational financial institutions to avoid paying income taxes to any government on their international financing activities			0

many of the companies named in a report out april 9 from the @entity7 even received federal tax rebates
