after what happened at the @entity3 @entity2 , i took a lot of time to reflect on the events of the weekend – and we met as a team to discuss it last friday , too			1
i analysed the whole situation in a lot of detail and reached the conclusion that i had to take responsibility for what happened because it was my error of judgement			0
it did n’t matter what part of right and wrong was involved , the fact is that it happened and i did not do a good enough job to avoid a collision between our two cars			0
error of judgement : @entity28 ( right ) collides with @entity29 during the @entity3 @entity2 debris flying : bits of @entity28 's front wing came off after the collision at @entity34 i have since apologised to everybody that i can ; starting with the fans because they wanted to see a battle with @entity29 and that did not happen			1
i have apologised to my team , and to everybody involved with the team			2
i have also apologised to @entity29			2
you can not however , change what has happened			0
the subject attracted a lot of media attention and sensation but i really hope my apology will be accepted by the @entity51 fans who have been critical of me			1
i was booed on the podium - which was n't a nice feeling - but i understand that people had travelled a long way to see a great race between @entity29 and myself , and they did not get that			1
i totally respect their opinion and i hope that in time they will accept my apology			2
i love my sport so much , i want @entity51 to be the best in the world and i want the fans to enjoy great racing			2
i started on pole in @entity34 but i got a really poor start off the line			0
i lost two positions to @entity29 and then to @entity68 which dropped me down to third			0
i passed @entity68 after he made a mistake through @entity71 and then on the second lap i was quicker than @entity29 coming out of @entity73			0
heading into @entity71 i tried to go around the outside of him to re-take the lead , but i misjudged the situation			0
in hindsight , the collision was my responsibility because i was the car trying to overtake , so i have to accept that i made a mistake and to apologise			1
i sustained damage to my front wing in the incident and it had to be replaced which saw me finish second behind race winner @entity87			1
the result enabled me to extend my lead in the championship , but when i left the circuit i had n't really thought about that			0
i was concerned and distraught about the situation ; one thing is for sure : i was n't happy			0
i was instead thinking about the criticism - the way @entity98 , for example , had been critical about my driving			1
apology : @entity28 has said sorry to @entity101 following the crash in @entity3 repentant : @entity28 also apologised to his @entity104 team and @entity51 fans i was also thinking about the team discussions we 'd had at the track ; the result of our collision meant that one of us did n't finish the race and the other one did n't win , so it had also cost the team a lot of points			1
@entity98 has since apologised for what he said and , in the heat of the moment you often say things that you regret - that has happened to all of us			2
last friday , @entity29 , @entity124 , @entity125 and i met for talks at our headquarters in @entity128 and it was very intense , but the outcome was a positive one : we have drawn a line under what happened in @entity3 - we move forward and we can go racing again			1
poor start : @entity29 ( left ) overtook @entity28 ( immediately behind him ) on the first corner it has always been clear from the team that @entity29 and i must not collide with one another during a race			2
if it did happen , and one driver is more responsible than the other , then there will be consequences			0
the team have made it clear that we can go racing for the remainder of the season , and all i can say is that i am feeling good and i 'm in full - on attack mode heading into this weekend 's @entity152 @entity2 at @entity153			1
the team is doing such an awesome job in developing our car and making it faster and faster			0
so every race i have the chance to be on pole and win , which is a very special feeling			0
since @entity34 , i have been in the simulator preparing for @entity153 , and i have taken part in some pr work , for example a @entity165 with @entity166 and some @entity168 clients			1
not a nice feeling : @entity28 was booed when he stepped on to the podium in @entity3 on sunday we had what we call a team family day at @entity174 in @entity175			1
it 's great because every employee of the @entity104 team brings their family so you can imagine how busy it was ! there were thousands of us there , and it is nice to give something back for all the hard work they put in			1
this year they have changed the run - off area at the world - famous @entity191 corner in @entity153 , replacing the gravel trap with @entity194			2
i have n't seen it yet , but i notice that it has attracted some criticism from the sport 's fans			2
i completely understand that and it is a pity because it makes it easier for the drivers when there is room for error			0
but safety has to be the priority , and that is why they 've brought in the change			0
@entity87 's win in @entity3 saw him close the gap to @entity29 and i in the drivers ' standings			1
he is doing a great job this season and he is a serious rival for title so we must keep a close eye on him and @entity221 in the remaining six races			0
mind the gap : @entity87 celebrates his @entity3 @entity2 win and he is doing a great job for @entity221 @entity28 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity227 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity51 mechanics and their families , putting @entity104 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			1
you can follow @entity28 on @entity239 @ nico_rosberg and @entity104 @ @entity240			0

i said sorry to everybody ; the fans , @entity29 and my @entity104 team
i hope followers of @entity51 will accept that apology
the collision was my responsibility because i was trying to overtake
my front wing was damaged and that 's why i finished second
being booed on podium was n't nice but i understand why i was *heckled*
team had an intense meeting and a line has been drawn under @entity3
@entity98 was critical of my driving but he has since apologised
me and @entity29 can race for rest of season - i 'm in full - on attack mode
i 've been in the simulator preparing for @entity152 @entity2 at @entity153
