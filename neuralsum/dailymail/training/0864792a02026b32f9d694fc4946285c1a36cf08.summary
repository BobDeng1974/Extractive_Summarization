medical attention : specialists treated the fan at the @entity25 two weeks after he started suffering a constant , worsening headache that affected his entire head ' our patient had no history of head trauma so we assume that headbanging , with its brisk forward and backward acceleration and deceleration forces , led to rupturing of bridging veins causing haemorrhage into the subdural space , ' said doctors writing in @entity68 medical journal			1
a review of the medical literature revealed three previous cases where headbanging led to blood clots			0
one , an acute haematoma , resulted in sudden death			0
