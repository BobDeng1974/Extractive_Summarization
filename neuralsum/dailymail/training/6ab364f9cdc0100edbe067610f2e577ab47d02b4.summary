@entity0 : tales from @entity2 by @entity3 in hardback			1
this winning self - deprecation continues throughout : he also declares @entity18 the perfect @entity12 , who ‘ looks as though he could actually kill			1
whereas i just hugged or bored them to death ’			0
it is perfectly true that , in terms of his own acting ability , @entity3 has plenty to be modest about			1
what he does have in his favour is a decency and affability that , far more than versatility as an actor , have turned him into one of his profession ’s most respected elder statesmen			2
@entity3 as @entity12 with @entity36 as @entity37 in a view to kill , released in 1985 and which , by the by , have yielded friendships that he draws on in this collection of showbiz anecdotes , although he is not averse to telling stories second or even third - hand			1
such as one about @entity46 who , on being invited by @entity48 @entity47 and @entity49 to celebrate his 90th birthday at the @entity51 , declared he ’d be delighted to join them , since ‘ most of my real friends are dead ’			0
the same , alas , is also true of 86 - year - old @entity3			2
the cast of this book have mostly relocated to the celestial cutting - room			0
but even in death , they are an illustrious bunch			0
i had no idea , for example , that @entity3 was friendly with @entity63 , whom he first met at a fundraising dinner in @entity2 in the 1950s , at which @entity63 fell out , loudly and publicly , with @entity66			1
@entity3 seduced 20 women as @entity12 @entity68 , the head of @entity69 , had bid $ 1,000 for one of his contract artists , @entity72 , to sing at the event , only for ‘ @entity74 ’ @entity66 to bid $ 2,000 for @entity75 not to sing			1
@entity63 was a friend of @entity72 ’s , and considered it an unforgivable insult			1
he and the @entity74 duly squared up to each other , and it was n’t just their stature as bona fide superstars , but also their difference in size , writes @entity3 , that made the spectacle ‘ something i ’ll never forget ’			2
the old trouper is certainly well - equipped for some classy name - dropping			0
@entity89 , no less , taught him the art of screen - kissing ( ‘ passion without pressure ’ ) on the set of the 1956 film @entity96			0
and he once took @entity97 to the dog track at @entity99 , where everyone was too preoccupied with the greyhounds to notice the tiny , middle - aged woman thoroughly enjoying herself going back and forth to the betting counter was a proper , @entity2 giant			0
@entity3 with good friend @entity105 ( left ) , who he met at @entity107 's house in the early 1970s			1
@entity3 was also friends with @entity63 whom he first met at a fundraising dinner in @entity2 in the 1950s , at which @entity63 fell out , loudly and publicly , with @entity66 this book could do with more personal encounters such as that , and less recycling of other people ’s stories — including a few that are downright whiskery with age			1
the best tales are @entity3 ’s own , and i enjoyed the revelation that his great pal @entity107 had no time for his neighbour on the @entity125 , @entity126 , much to the latter ’s chagrin			1
‘ he ’s never invited me for dinner or a drink , ’ @entity126 used to grumble			0
‘ @entity138 ’ is one of the many nicknames and diminutives that pepper this book , along with the likes of ‘ @entity136 and ‘ @entity137			0
@entity3 grew hugely fond of @entity105 , whom he met at @entity107 ’s house in the early 1970s , and the affection was clearly mutual			1
once , at the height of the @entity143 threat in @entity144 , @entity3 left the house in @entity146 that @entity105 had rented while making the @entity147 to find his host underneath his car , checking it for bombs			1
@entity3 in his most iconic role			2
the star has no qualms in saying that his acting left a lot to be desired if that story is entirely consistent with @entity105 ’s screen image as a thoroughly decent cove , another , about @entity160 , is dramatically at odds with the public perception			1
apparently , that most upstanding of actors , the very embodiment of the @entity165 stiff upper lip , had a party piece that he unveiled on the sets of most films he worked on : he used to drop his trousers , pass wind thunderously , and then ignite it			2
@entity174 will never seem the same again			0
somewhat more wholesomely , there is a nice story about @entity3 ’s ‘ dear friend ’ @entity177 , the legendary @entity12 producer , whose passionate @entity178 dated from an encounter with a waiter at the @entity181 , on @entity177 ’s inaugural visit to @entity165 in 1948			1
on his first morning , he went down to breakfast and ordered bacon and eggs , only to be told that , because of rationing , he could n’t have any			0
but , a couple of days later , the same waiter delivered two boiled eggs under a silver dome , and discreetly confided that he ’d smuggled them in from home			0
@entity177 became instantly smitten with @entity165 and the @entity165 , and later insisted on making all his bond films here			0
one wonders whether that anonymous waiter ever knew how much employment resulted from his simple act of generosity ? regrettably , the book does not enjoy quite the same standard of production as the @entity12 films			2
spelling and grammatical errors abound , and one picture caption turns up eight pages early			0
but that ’s not @entity3 ’s fault			2
even if this book is not destined for phenomenal , worldwide success , it certainly deserves to sell more than three copies — and far beyond @entity15 .			0

@entity3 tells tales of actors who did *n't* get on and secret grumblings
the star has no qualms in saying that his acting left a lot to be desired
the @entity12 actor was good friend @entity105 and @entity63
