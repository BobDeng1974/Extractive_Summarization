@entity2 's 2003 @entity1 - winning coach sir @entity0 knows a thing or two about the @entity4 , having won the @entity4 three times during his seven - year tenure			1
here , the @entity8 columnist previews the 2015 edition and predicts who will finish where ... @entity2 it is crucial that @entity2 approach the @entity4 like a knockout competition because that is how they need to tackle the @entity1			1
in 2003 we ramped up the pressure on our players and challenged them to prepare for each game as if it was a @entity1 semi-final			0
it ’s time for @entity22 ’s team to deliver			2
one to watch : @entity23 injuries have hampered him and he wo n’t play against @entity25 but the @entity27 prop is up there with the best in the world			0
he is destructive in the tight and loose			0
@entity23 ( left , celebrating the @entity31 win in 2013 ) has been plagued by injuries in the last few years head coach : @entity22 captain : @entity35 most capped player : @entity37 — 61 @entity38 ground : @entity39 capacity : 82,000 @entity4 record tournament wins : 26 ( 10 shared ) @entity42 : 12 2014 result : an opening defeat by @entity45 crushed @entity46 hopes and the championship was lost on points difference			1
prediction : 2nd the pressure is on @entity22 ( second right ) and his coaching team in @entity1 year @entity25 i liked @entity55 ’s show of confidence in naming his team 48 hours early			1
it was an indication of how settled his side is and a statement that @entity25 do n’t believe they have anything to hide or fear from @entity2			2
i ’d like to see more width on the ball but @entity25 clearly know their gameplan			0
@entity66 : @entity67 on the 2013 @entity31 tour @entity67 proved to be one of the finest centres in the world			0
he is exceptionally strong with a low centre of gravity but also has excellent hands and a good kicking game			0
@entity67 is regarded as one of the best centres in the world and is a key man for @entity25 head coach : @entity55 captain : @entity82 most capped player : @entity84 — 110 @entity38 ground : @entity85 capacity : 74,500 @entity4 record tournament wins : 26 ( 12 shared ) @entity42 : 11 2014 result : the defending champions were well off the pace , losing to @entity2 and @entity91			1
prediction : 3rd @entity55 ( left ) has won three @entity4 titles since taking over as @entity25 head coach @entity91 @entity95 is the outstanding coach in the northern hemisphere and it ’s no coincidence he is working in a system which prioritises the national team			1
as a result , @entity91 are in the best shape for years			2
but can they cope with the favourites ’ tag ? one to watch : @entity105 the fly - half has struggled with concussion over the past year but looks as if he ’ll be fit for @entity91 ’s second game			1
an exciting player who threatens with his pace and who has the all - round game to set his backline free			0
fly - half @entity105 crosses for @entity91 against @entity45 during the 2014 @entity4 head coach : @entity95 captain : @entity117 most capped player : @entity117 — 96 @entity38 ground : @entity119 capacity : 51,700 @entity4 record tournament wins : 12 ( @entity122 shared ) @entity42 : 2 2014 result : despite losing to @entity2 , @entity91 claimed the championship in @entity126 ’s final game			1
prediction : 1st @entity95 stands alongside captain @entity128 with the trophy @entity91 are defending this year @entity130 @entity131 is a serious coach who has clearly knocked @entity130 into shape , judging by their performances in the autumn when they pushed the @entity137 very close			1
always highly committed but there are promising signs of their wide game developing			0
one to watch : @entity142 i love the young fly - half ’s confidence and willingness to back himself , which shone through during the autumn			0
the 22 - year - old has an excellent passing game and is fiercely committed in defence			2
a very talented player with a big future			0
young playmaker @entity142 ( left ) impressed during the autumn internationals for @entity130 head coach : @entity131 captain : @entity157 most capped player : @entity159 — 91 @entity38 ground : @entity160 capacity : 67,144 @entity4 record tournament wins : 14 ( eight shared ) @entity42 : 3 2014 result : managed a solitary win against @entity165 by just a point to avoid the wooden spoon			1
prediction : 5th new zealander @entity131 took the @entity130 job last year after eight successful seasons with @entity171 @entity172 @entity173 has an even more challenging relationship than @entity22 with his clubs and @entity45 ’s national team are clearly suffering as a result			2
their opening match in @entity180 against @entity130 will be an emotional one and could set the tone for the @entity4			2
one to watch : @entity183 for years @entity45 have messed around playing scrum - halves at fly - half and vice-versa but finally seem to have settled on an out - an - out no 10			0
if @entity188 can merit an extended run in the side it should pay huge dividends for @entity172			0
@entity171 fly - half @entity183 cemented the no 10 jersey for @entity45 as his impressed in the autumn head coach : @entity195 captain : @entity197 most capped player : @entity199 — 76 @entity38 ground : @entity45 capacity : 81,338 @entity4 record tournament wins : 17 ( eight shared ) @entity42 : 9 2014 result : scraped a dramatic late win against @entity2 on day one but poor after that			1
prediction : 4th @entity45 captain @entity197 trains ahead of their @entity4 opener against @entity130 @entity165 last year was extremely disappointing for @entity165 , which hinted for the first time in many years that their progress had stalled			1
they have some promising young players coming through but the loss of centre @entity213 is significant			0
one to watch : @entity215 injury blighted last season for him but the 31 - year - old remains arguably the best no 8 in the world — alongside @entity221 of @entity137			2
he is such a powerful athlete who carries superbly but combines his running with the footballing skills of an international centre			0
@entity165 's captain @entity215 has been consistently rated among the world 's best players for years head coach : @entity229 captain : @entity215 most capped player : @entity232 — 110 @entity38 ground : @entity233 capacity : 82,307 @entity4 record tournament wins : 0 @entity42 : 0 2014 result : after finishing 4th in 2013 , @entity165 resumed their traditional place at the bottom of the pile			1
prediction : 6th head coach @entity229 knows he must improve on @entity165 's dire showing at last year 's @entity4			1

@entity4 kicks off on *friday* , *february* 6
@entity91 are the defending champions and favourites for this year 's title
