@entity0 was today accused of making ' pathetic excuses ' for not wanting to take part in tv debates during the election campaign			1
@entity5 said the prime minister was ' frit ' after joining @entity7 and @entity8 in insisting the @entity9 must not be allowed to block the clashes			1
in an unprecedented alliance , the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 leaders have written identical letters to mr @entity0 suggesting he be ' empty chaired ' by broadcasters if he does not give ground			1
@entity19 insists that the @entity20 should be allowed to take part , but this is being seen as an attempt to stop the debates happening at all			0
@entity0 was challenged over the debates during prime minister 's questions in the @entity28 today @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity8 have stepped up pressure on @entity0 to agree to take part in the tv debates @entity19 insists that the @entity20 should be allowed to take part , but this is being seen as an attempt to stop the debates happening at all			1
the prime minister said he would not sign up to a proposal from @entity37 's main broadcasters for the tv debates unless it was changed to include the @entity20			0
in bruising clashes in the @entity28 , @entity5 deployed @entity42 's famous barb by branding mr @entity0 ' frit '			1
the @entity12 leader pointed out that in 2010 mr @entity0 had condemned ' feeble ' reasons for backing out of debates , and said ' no - one believed ' his protests were genuine now			1
' it is frankly a pathetic excuse			0
it is not for him , it is not for me , it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate			0
it is up to the broadcasters , that is the country we live in , ' mr @entity5 said			2
' is he really telling the people of @entity37 that he is going to seek to deny them the tv debate if he does n't get to choose who is in them ? ' mr @entity0 hit back that mr @entity5 was ' chicken ' for being unwilling to face off against @entity20 leader @entity66 as well as @entity13 leader @entity7 and @entity14 's @entity8			1
' i 'm all for these debates but you can not have two minor parties without the third minor party			0
why is he frightened of debating the @entity20 ? ' the debates form a traditional part of @entity74 presidential elections , but critics say they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign			0
in october the main broadcasters set out plans for three debates , with @entity14 leader @entity8 offered a slot in one contest for the first time			1
under the plans , @entity84 and @entity85 would host a debate between mr @entity5 and mr @entity0 , hosted by @entity87			1
the @entity88 is planning to host a debate , chaired by @entity90 , between mr @entity0 , mr @entity5 and mr @entity7 â€“ a repeat of the three - way format seen in 2010			1
@entity93 would host the four - way debate , including mr @entity8 for the first time , chaired by @entity93 presenter @entity95			1
but last week mr @entity0 ruled out taking part unless the @entity20 leader @entity66 was included			2
when asked if it was correct that would not take part as it stands , mr @entity0 told @entity100 : ' @entity101			2
' the @entity9 pushed for the debates to happen in 2010 , when mr @entity7 was seen to have have triumphed over mr @entity0 and @entity103 candidates : @entity0 and @entity5 host : @entity87 candidates : @entity0 , @entity5 , @entity7 host : @entity90 , candidates : @entity0 , @entity5 , @entity7 host : @entity95 more than 20million people watched the tv debates in 2010 , the first time political leaders had gone head - to - head in @entity37			1
today 's letters to mr @entity0 point out that he had ' enthusiastically endorsed ' the idea when in opposition			2
mr @entity5 , mr @entity7 and mr @entity8 add : ' i believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician 's unwillingness to participate			1
' i hope you will agree that the decision as to who should take part in the televised debates should not be in the hands of any party leader , each of whom inevitably has their own political interests to defend			0
it must be a decision independently and objectively arrived at			0
' the leaders insisted the broadcasters were under strict obligations of political impartiality and had made an ' objective determination ' about who should participate			2
' while each of the other parties invited to take part in the debates has their own views on the proposal and the levels of participation offered and will continue to make their case in this regard , we all accept the independence and impartiality of the broadcasters and have committed to take part in the debates , ' the letters added			0
' it would be unacceptable if the political self - interest of one party leader were to deny the public the opportunity to see their leaders debate in public			2
' therefore , if you are unwilling to reconsider , the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last minute change of heart			0
' these debates are not the property of the politicians and i do not believe the public will accept lightly the prospect of any politician seeking to block them			0
' @entity20 leader @entity66 has insisted she should be included in televised debates alongside @entity8 polling by @entity185 shows how during 2014 @entity14 overtook the @entity13 , who are now also being challenged by the @entity187 @entity19 said its position on the debates ' has n't changed ' , insisting any multi party format must include the @entity20 and should take place outside main election campaign			1
a @entity194 source said : ' it shows how desperate @entity5 is to keep the @entity187 out - and stop them taking @entity12 votes - that he is prepared to team up with @entity8 and agree an identical letter they could both send			1
' @entity13 election chief @entity199 accused mr @entity0 of being ' frit '			1
he told @entity201 : ' is it perfect for the @entity13 ? no , it 's not , but in the interests of having these debates , we go ahead			2
' what mr @entity0 is trying to do is hold us to ransom because it 's not in his interests to go ahead with the debate			2
the idea that it 's about the @entity187 is complete nonsense			2
' @entity42 had a word for this : it 's that he 's frit and that 's exactly what it is			0
can you imagine mrs @entity42 refusing to go and debate and using the @entity187 as cover to do so ? ' i mean , even @entity103 , who did n't want to do this , in the end did it			2
so we can only draw the conclusion that mr @entity0 , frankly , has got less confident in his own ability to make his case than @entity103 had			2
' mr @entity8 insisted there was no regulatory barrier to broadcasting without mr @entity0			1
' it is pretty clear that from the @entity88 's own editorial guidelines , you would be within your rights to hold these debates whether mr @entity0 turned up or not , ' he told @entity237 's today			1
' in 2010 @entity0 did very badly in these debates and was seen to be the loser			0
and i have seen this week that he has launched the six main priorities for the @entity243 ' general election campaign and he has completely ignored the issues of @entity245 and immigration			0
' i feel very strongly he would rather not debate these things with me on national television			0
' a chicken hired to chase @entity251 over his refusal to take part in a tv debate with @entity255 almost defected to @entity12 after seeing the party 's leader close up , it emerged today			1
former conservative party aide @entity258 said the actor hired to dress as a chicken was so impressed by mr @entity251 during their encounters there were fears he would jump ship			0
now a @entity194 peer and columnist , lord @entity258 made the revelation has proof that voters will take little notice of whether @entity0 takes part in the debate or not , adding : ' after all , even the chicken himself was resolutely unimpressed			1
' the @entity194 party hired a chicken in 1997 to stalk @entity251 over his refusal to take in a tv debate with @entity255 writing in @entity277 , lord @entity258 said that in 1997 the conservative party hired an actor to dress up as a chicken and follow mr @entity251 around			1
' unfortunately , the more the actor saw of mr @entity251 , the more he liked him			0
and so the idea took hold that the chicken might , as it were , cross the road			0
' this would have been a @entity288 disaster even greater than having involved ourselves in such a stupid stunt in the first place			0
' so i was given a job			0
i was to have lunch with the chicken on a regular basis and keep him onside			0
i proved myself worthy of the trust placed in me			0
