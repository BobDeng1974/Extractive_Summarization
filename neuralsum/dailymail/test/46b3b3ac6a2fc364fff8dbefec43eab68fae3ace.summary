his neighbors would n't let him build a film studio			1
so @entity3 is retaliating in a way that only the cream of @entity6 could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area			1
the complex of affordable housing , funded and designed by the @entity12 director , would provide homes to 224 low - income families			1
and there 's very little his fellow @entity17 residents can do about it			0
citing opposition from neighbors , a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an ' evil empire '			2
but it seems the award - winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his @entity42 estate in @entity43 , @entity44			2
the project , submitted for planning on wednesday , would span 52 acres and cost around $ 200m			0
just a few meters from his own @entity48 , the community would consist of two complexes			2
one would contain 120 two - bedroom and three - bedroom homes for low - income families			1
the other would be for pensioners : a four - story building with 104 one - bedroom or two - bedroom apartments			0
because @entity3 proposes to fund the project himself , his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there			2
however , his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation			0
' he said " we 've got enough millionaires here			0
what we need is some houses for regular working people " , ' his lawyer @entity69 told @entity70			0
scrapped : this was a rendering of the film studio that @entity3 planned to build on the estate but was overruled idyllic : the 224 - home community would be built in this idyllic spot of @entity44 for low - income families @entity43 supervisor @entity82 told the station : ' @entity3 said , " if i â€™m not going to do what i wanted to do there , what can i do that would be really beneficial to this community ? " ' it is not the first time @entity3 has courted controversy			1
in november 2014 , residents of @entity93 filed a lawsuit against @entity3 ' plans to build a museum along the shore of @entity98			1
the case was a major blow to the @entity101 , a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia , after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with @entity108 .			0

neighbors *blocked* @entity3 ' plans to build a film studio in 2012
now he plans to erect a housing complex on land off @entity31
the community would provide housing to 224 low - income families
with huge *support* from low - income community , his neighbors will be hard - pressed to block the proposal
