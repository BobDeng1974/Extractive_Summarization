by @entity1 reporter published : 10:05 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 06:18 est , 27 september 2012 leaving a simple phone message could help spot the early signs of @entity4 ’s years before serious symptoms develop , say scientists			1
researchers have discovered they can detect the disease through voice recordings with initial studies already showing a 99 per cent accuracy rate			1
a team at @entity13 has developed a computer programme that is able to recognise the tremors , breathiness and weakness in the voice , which are thought to be early indicators of the condition			1
the technology works partly by tracking the motion of the vocal cords and detecting any tremor the voice analysis software can even provide an unprecedented level of detail that can distinguish how far along a patient is with the disease			1
the @entity4 ’s @entity30 led by @entity32 scientist dr @entity31 , is looking to see if the same results can be repeated with voice recordings taken over the telephone			1
dr @entity31 ’s wider study calls on healthy volunteers as well as patients with @entity4 ’s to take part in a three minute phone call where they are asked to say ' aah ' , speak a few sentences and answer some questions			1
dr @entity31 is creating a database of voices to help diagnose @entity4 's if the research proves successful , it could have the potential to offer hope to thousands of people and become a quick and cheap diagnostic tool of the future that can be done from the comfort of the home			1
dr @entity31 said : ' science tells us voice impairment might be an early sign of @entity4 ’s			1
it sounds counterintuitive as @entity4 ’s is a movement disorder but the voice is a form of movement			2
' we do n’t tend to think of the larynx and vocal chords but you are moving them when you make speech sounds			0
it ’s a complex sound of movement and it tends to degrade in @entity4 ’s			0
' neurologists look at changes in the ability to move , which is done with the limbs , but we are looking in the vocal organs - the sounds that come out of the mouth			0
' we are fairly confident we can detect the disease over the telephone			0
' the breakthrough technology could alert doctors to prescribe early treatment , which could slow the progress of the disease			2
the current approach to a @entity4 ’s diagnosis can take years , as there is no blood test that detects it			0
dr @entity91 , director of research at @entity93 described the study as an ' exciting prospect '			1
mr @entity31 says combining voice recordings with computer technology can show exactly where someone lies between health and disease he said : ' the @entity4 ’s @entity30 could lead to voice recognition tests that can diagnose and monitor @entity4 ’s			1
' we know that speech is often affected in people with @entity4 ’s - so developing a test that can spot the earliest subtle changes is an exciting prospect			0
' at the moment we do n’t have a definitive test to diagnose @entity4 ’s , and no reliable way to monitor the development of the condition - which is a massive barrier to finding a cure			2
@entity114 has retired from acting after being diagnosed with @entity4 's ' finding simple and accurate ways to diagnose and monitor @entity4 ’s is one of our key research priorities			0
' there are 127,000 sufferers in the @entity32 living with the incurable disease with the number set to soar due to the ageing population			0
parkinson ’s disease often starts with hand tremors followed by symptoms including muscle rigidity or stiffness and slow movement			2
sufferers do n’t have enough of a chemical called dopamine because some cells in their brain have died			0
without dopamine people can find that their movements become slower so it takes longer to do things			0
most people who get @entity4 ’s are over 50			0
@entity143 actor @entity142 , 51 , was diagnosed in 1991 and boxing legend @entity144 , 70 , who appeared in the @entity146 opening ceremony , also has the condition			2
veteran actor @entity114 , 69 , announced earlier this year he would be retiring from acting after being diagnosed with the disease			0
the researchers are building up a database of 10,000 voices from across the globe to aid their study			1
