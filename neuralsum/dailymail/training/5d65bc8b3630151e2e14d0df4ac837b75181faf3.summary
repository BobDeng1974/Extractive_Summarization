by @entity0 published : 22:15 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 01:36 est , 4 october 2013 @entity2 's hallowed halls of learning have been flush with gossip about a so - called ' poopertrator ' after a student or students unknown began defecating on clean clothes in the laundry at @entity10 residential college			1
the matter was brought to campus officials ' attention after a student brought physical evidence of the crime to the @entity10 master @entity18 's office			2
according to the @entity20 , the pooper has been on the loose since early september , but it was n't until student @entity22 showed the evidence - her soiled laundry - to college authorities that @entity2 police joined the search			1
dirty laundry : @entity29 it may be , but someone at @entity2 is causing a stink on september 7 , @entity22 went to @entity10 's laundry room to collect her clean washing from a dryer after it had already been urinated in the laundry earlier in the day			1
she had rewashed the clothes , but when she removed her clothing from the dryer she realized that they were covered in feces			2
' i simultaneously wanted to throw up , cry and punch someone , ' @entity22 told the @entity20			0
the serial - pooper quickly became the talk of @entity44 , with students dubbing the trending scandal # poopgate2k13			0
it seems that while not engaged in intellectual pursuits , a person , almost certainly a @entity2 student , had been throwing food and urine into dryers for some weeks before @entity22 's dryer discovery			1
the recent escalation to fecal matter has college residents watching their clothing for the entire dryer cycle , and some campus colleges fear a spate of copy - cat laundry poopers			2
some students , however , are unconcerned about the nefarious laundry - soiler and ' @entity66 ' parties have been thrown around the university			0
exclusive : @entity2 is one of the nation 's most sought - after colleges and others have taken a more academic approach to the issue			1
' leave it to @entity20 , @entity76 , and the @entity2 administration to miss a work of art , even when it hits them like a stinking pile of s * * t. this is clearly an act of the avant - garde , not a criminal mind , ' wrote a commenter on @entity20 , only identifying themselves as ' @entity87 '			2
' defying bourgeoisie standards of etiquette , and destabilizing the hegemonic " clean / dirty " binary ( which itself is underpinned and constructed by hidden economic , racial , and gender ideologies ) our intrepid defecator ( though perhaps we can not assume that the artist recycled his or her own byproduct ) juxtaposes the filthy with the sanitary , making the thought - provoking suggestion that we are all full of it , always and at all times , even at our most pristine , ' wrote the former student and consummate stirrer			0
according to the @entity20 , there have been at least four separate incidents involving human feces in the @entity10 laundry			1
' we have asked our students not to leave their laundry unattended , the affected machines have been thoroughly disinfected , and we are actively seeking information about who the perpetrator might be , ' @entity18 told the @entity20			0
dryer disaster : many students have had their clothing ruined by someone throwing food waste , urine and feces into the dryer with their clean clothes @entity18 also sent an email addressing the matter to students : ' @entity125 , ' he wrote			1
' someone has been doing weird , creepy , and ( frankly ) disgusting things in the @entity128			0
if you have observed something of this nature , or know who the perpetrator might be , please let me know			0
i ca n’t imagine why someone would do these things , but it has got to stop , and we will take measures to be sure it does			0
' student @entity142 told the @entity20 that students have been standing watch over the dryers to ensure their clothes do n't get ruined , and that many students think the college should employ 24 - hour security guards in the laundry			2
' it ’s ruining people ’s quality of life , ' she said			0
the search continues for the @entity2 poopertrator - and when he or she is found , the poop will surely hit the fan .			1

someone at a @entity2 residential college has been throwing human feces into dryers with other people 's clean clothing
there have been more that four incidents over the past month
@entity2 police are now searching for the person dubbed the ' poopertrator '
