a substance derived from sugar has been found to ' kill ' good cholesterol , turning it ' bad ' , scientists have discovered			2
researchers from the @entity5 found methylglyoxal ( @entity7 ) , which is formed from glucose in the body , damages ' good ' @entity12 ( @entity12 ) cholesterol , which removes excess levels of ' bad ' cholesterol from the body			1
ldl cholesterol is considered the ‘ bad ’ cholesterol because it contributes to plaque : a thick , hard deposit that can clog arteries			0
if an artery is narrowed by plaque and a clot forms , it can become blocked and the person can suffer a heart attack or stroke			0
researchers say that drugs and food supplements could be developed to control the damage to ' good ' hdl cholesterol by @entity33 ( @entity7 ) , formed from glucose in the body , which leads to an increased risk of heart disease hdl cholesterol is considered ‘ good ’ cholesterol because it helps remove ldl cholesterol from the arteries			1
experts believe @entity12 acts as a scavenger , carrying ldl cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver , where it is broken down and passed from the body			0
supported by funding from the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , the researchers discovered that @entity7 destabilises ‘ good ’ hdl cholesterol and causes it to lose the properties which protect against heart disease			1
low levels of @entity12 are closely linked to heart disease , with increased levels of @entity7 being common in the elderly and those with diabetes or kidney problems			1
@entity12 damaged by @entity7 is rapidly cleared from the blood , reducing the blood ’s hdl content , or remains in plasma having lost its beneficial function			0
lead researcher dr @entity64 , of @entity65 , said that @entity7 damage to @entity12 causes a significant increase in the risk of heart disease			1
high levels of @entity7 , which is formed from glucose in the body occurs in diseases including diabetes , kidney disease , heart disease and obesity she said : ‘ @entity7 damage to @entity12 is a new and likely important cause of low and dysfunctional hdl , and could count for up to a 10 per cent risk of heart disease			1
' there are currently no drugs that can reverse low levels of @entity12 , but research revealing how exactly @entity7 damages hdl helps scientists to come up with strategies for reducing @entity7 levels , dr @entity81 said			1
she added : ‘ by understanding how @entity7 damages hdl we can now focus on developing drugs that reduce the concentration of @entity7 in the blood , but it not only be drugs that can help			2
’ another strategy could be to develop food supplements that decrease @entity7 by increasing the amount of a protein called glyoxalase 1 , or @entity99 , which converts @entity7 to harmless substances , she said			2
she concluded : ‘ this means that in future we have both new drugs and new foods that can help prevent and correct low hdl , all through the control of @entity7 ’ @entity7 is formed from glucose in the body , and is 40 , 0000 times more reactive than glucose			1
it damages hdl at a functionally important site , causing the particle to become unstable			0
@entity7 levels are normally kept low in the body to maintain good health but they slowly increase with ageing			2
this is because @entity117 , which converts @entity7 to harmless substances and protects us , slowly becomes worn out and is not replaced quickly			0
supplies of @entity117 depleting in the body lead to abnormally high levels of @entity123 is called ‘ dicarbonyl stress ’ and occurs in diseases including diabetes , kidney disease , heart disease and obesity			0
the study was published in the journal @entity132 .			0

@entity33 ( @entity7 ) is formed from glucose in the body , but is *40,000* times more reactive than glucose
@entity5 team found that @entity7 damages ' good ' cholesterol
experts say @entity7 damage to ' good ' cholesterol could count for up to a 10 *%* risk of heart disease
drugs and food supplements to reduce @entity7 levels could prevent and correct low levels of ' good ' cholesterol associated with heart disease
