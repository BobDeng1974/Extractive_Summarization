by @entity0 published : 10:00 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 04:40 est , 24 may 2012 @entity1 was facing the prospect of a devastating financial crisis last night , as @entity4 teetered on the brink of a chaotic exit from the single currency			1
stock markets across @entity1 plunged after the mighty @entity9 warned that it would be better to let @entity4 leave the euro than give its crippled economy any more cash			1
at an emergency summit in @entity15 last night , @entity13 pleaded with dithering @entity1 leaders to end the ‘ fudge ’ over the euro crisis			1
new order ? @entity21 president @entity20 ( left ) and @entity23 's prime minister @entity22 ( right ) are among leaders to be told to prepare contingency plans in case @entity4 quits the single currency the prime minister told an emergency summit of @entity31 leaders in @entity15 there was no point discussing plans to kickstart economic growth unless they acted ‘ decisively ’ to shore up the ailing single currency			1
in a separate blow it emerged that all eurozone countries have been ordered to draw up contingency plans for a @entity4 exit			1
the @entity9 warnings sparked panic on stock markets , with £ 35billion wiped off the @entity45			1
@entity47 ’s stock market fell 3.7 per cent , while @entity23 ’s dropped 3.2 per cent			0
the euro also fell to a two - year low against the dollar			0
warning : officials said the instruction was agreed on monday by a teleconference of the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) - experts who work on behalf of the bloc 's finance ministers behind closed doors in @entity15 , mr @entity13 warned fellow @entity31 leaders that ‘ contagion ’ from a @entity4 exit could destabilise the @entity1 economy for years			1
‘ we need a plan to deal with contagion , ’ he said			0
but mr @entity13 ’s words appeared to have gone unheeded last night as @entity67 chancellor @entity66 hinted that @entity67 was preparing to cut @entity4 loose unless it agrees to stick to the tough terms of last year ’s bailout deal			1
last night ’s summit dinner broke up without any clear agreement on @entity4			2
the six - hour session was dominated by discussions on economic growth , with less than an hour dedicated to the @entity4 crisis			1
@entity21 insisted on pushing ahead with controversial proposals for a tax on financial transactions , which experts warn will hit the @entity80			0
mr @entity13 described the proposal as a ‘ bad idea ’ and pledged to ‘ fight it all the way ’			2
after the talks , @entity86 president @entity85 said he wanted @entity4 ‘ to remain in the euro area ’			2
he said : ‘ we had an in - depth discussion on the latest developments in the euro area during which we also reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard its financial stability and integrity			0
’ earlier in the evening mrs @entity66 rejected calls for the introduction of so - called eurobonds to ease the debt crisis			0
the @entity67 chancellor said the idea , which would effectively see @entity67 underwrite the eurozone ’s vast debts , was illegal under @entity31 law and was ‘ not a contribution to stimulating growth ’			2
her stance is a major blow to @entity21 ’s new socialist president @entity20 who had insisted that @entity98 were on the agenda of last night ’s summit			0
but it is also a snub to mr @entity13 , who had earlier told @entity114 that the @entity67 stance was ‘ changing to an extent ’			1
the prime minister said @entity98 ‘ must ’ be part of the solution , and suggested that ‘ large fiscal transfers ’ to struggling eurozone countries would also be needed			1
riots : @entity4 has been hit by bouts of civil disorder in recent months speaking in the @entity126 he appealed to @entity31 leaders to act now			2
he said : ‘ i do n’t believe we can afford to allow this issue to be endlessly fudged or put off			0
’ but he warned it was becoming ‘ ever more urgent ’ to draw up contingency plans for a possible @entity4 exit , adding : ‘ frankly , it ’s not in our power about whether @entity4 will decide to stay in the eurozone or out of the eurozone , we have to prepare for every eventuality however difficult that might be			1
’ @entity23 can not continue much longer with its current high borrowing rates , its prime minister warned today as he urged a joint @entity1 response to keep the region 's debt problems from getting worse			0
@entity22 and newly elected @entity21 president @entity20 also stressed their commitment to keeping @entity4 in the euro despite its political uncertainty			2
he said : ' @entity1 has to come up with an answer			0
it is a must , because we can not go on like this for a long time , with large differences when it comes to financing ourselves			0
' and it is because of these differences that the policies that we @entity1 believe in , such as controlling government spending and reforms to encourage growth , ultimately have no effect			0
' ' so i am going to talk about liquidity , financing and debt sustainability			0
for me it is the most important thing today			0
there are a lot of important things but this is the most urgent one			0
' earlier the @entity9 sparked market panic by suggesting the fallout from a @entity4 exit would be ‘ considerable but manageable ’			1
@entity67 ’s powerful central bank said allowing @entity4 to backslide on agreed austerity measures would ‘ damage confidence ’ in other weakened eurozone states and could ‘ call into question ’ the future of the entire single currency			1
the @entity9 described the situation in @entity4 as ‘ extremely worrying ’			1
but it said @entity4 would have to ‘ bear the consequences ’ if it reneged on the terms of the bail - out deal			0
and the former @entity4 prime minister @entity184 added to the grim backdrop by suggesting @entity186 was also making preparations to leave the euro			1
he said : ‘ the risk of @entity4 leaving the euro is real and it depends effectively on whether the @entity4 people will support the continued implementation of the economic programme			2
’ in the @entity126 yesterday mr @entity13 insisted he was a ‘ genuine eurosceptic ’			0
he told @entity114 : ‘ i ’ve always been a genuine eurosceptic , sceptical about the euro , that ’s why i did n’t want to join it , but we have to recognise what is now in this country ’s interests , which is for the eurozone to sort out its difficulties			2
’ in a speech in @entity208 today mr @entity206 is expected to expose @entity210 tensions over the issue , by taking a swipe at those on the @entity215 benches who are urging @entity4 to quit the euro .			2

@entity67 @entity9 says it would be better for @entity4 to leave
