for decades their names have been at the heart of @entity4 life but @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 have now dropped off the list of our favourite ‘ superbrands ’			1
instead , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are seen as integral parts of the country ’s fabric			1
@entity17 and @entity18 are also new entries in the top 20 most popular big brands – an annual survey of 2,500 shoppers by market analysts at the @entity24			2
@entity25 lost : @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 have now dropped off the list of @entity4 's top 20 favourite ‘ superbrands ’ , having been replaced by @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity18 and @entity13 topping the chart for the second year running is @entity29 , followed by @entity30 , which was founded in @entity31 in 1905			1
@entity5 was last year @entity32 but does not even feature this year – following a string of controversies since it was taken over by @entity36 company @entity35 in 2010			1
the most recent public backlash came a few weeks ago when it changed the recipe of @entity39 and shrank the size of their multipacks			0
@entity6 – famed for its baked beans , tomato ketchup and tinned soups – has also slipped off the list after appearing at @entity47 last year			1
it is not known why the company , which has always been @entity36 - owned , is falling out of favour with @entity4			2
what 's not to love : ice cream brand @entity13 is new on the top - 20 superbrands list but our increasing curiosity in more exotic flavours and dishes could be one reason			1
however , the demise of @entity7 , which was no 18 in 2014 , will be particularly painful for its bosses , especially as rival @entity11 has leapt into the chart at @entity62			1
@entity7 has endured three difficult years , fuelled by poor sales of its womenswear and teething troubles with its new website			2
@entity18 makes its first appearance at @entity68 but has some way to go before catching up with winner @entity29			0
just last week , @entity29 ’s parent company @entity71 said it expected profits to surge 20 per cent to around £ 1.6billion this year			0
the firm ’s share price hit an all - time high as a result			0
@entity76 , chief executive of the @entity77 , said : ‘ @entity29 retaining the no 1 spot is a great example of a much - loved traditional brand that has also refreshed , refocused on innovation and invested to remain attractive and relevant			0
‘ it is winning out , while newer innovators , such as @entity84 , go in reverse , as the shine comes off			0
’ the internet giant has slipped from @entity88 to 18 , while @entity89 – the richest company in the world and best - known for its computers and mobile phones – is at a relatively lowly 10			0
both have suffered a backlash over accusations they have failed to pay a fair share of their taxes in the @entity4 .			0

@entity6 and @entity7 no *longer* on @entity4 's favourite brands list
replaced by @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity18 and @entity13
@entity5 was last year @entity32 but does not even feature this year
