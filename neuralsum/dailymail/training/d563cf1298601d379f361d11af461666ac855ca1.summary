thousands of travellers saw their holiday plans thrown into jeopardy after power failures struck at @entity5 and @entity6 airports			1
passengers reported queues stretching the length of the main terminal building for departures at @entity5 , where flights were still taking off despite the disruption			1
meanwhile a signalling problem at @entity6 meant that no trains could run into or out of the airport 's train station for at least 45 minutes - just three days before @entity18			1
frustrated passengers found themselves stuck on trains , with many complaining that they were not told whether or not they were likely to arrive at the airport in time for their flights			2
the power failure , which started in mid-afternoon , affected a satellite building and the track transit which takes passengers for boarding			1
@entity5 said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and passengers were being taken by bus to their flights			1
signalling problems at @entity6 apparently continued all day , because even after the issue was fixed there were tailbacks which lasted several hours and had a knock - on effect on services			1
this is the second @entity18 in a row that @entity6 has faced severe delays - last year , a power outage caused by flooding led to days of chaos at the airport			1
after today 's signal failure , just one @entity66 train was running from @entity68 to @entity6 every 45 minutes , compared to every 15 minutes under normal conditions			1
@entity70 said a signal problem occurred at 11.45am			0
normal service resumed only after 6.15pm last night			0
the problem had affected services run by the @entity70 , @entity66 , @entity75 and @entity77 train companies			2
waiting : passengers at @entity68 in @entity68 faced an anxious wait to see if they would catch the train warning : passengers were told to assume delays of up to 70 minutes on their way to the airport passengers were warned to expect delays of up to 70 minutes , which many travellers said would cause them to miss their flights			1
on @entity90 , @entity89 posted : ‘ it ’s the @entity18 period you ca n’t not know how to sort the signal failure or tell your customers how long the delay will last @entity6 ! ! ! ! ! ! ’ others pleaded with airlines to hold up their flights			1
one @entity90 user wrote : ‘ @ emirates all trains into @entity6 have been stopped , loads of passengers on your flight			1

@entity107 tweeted : ' argh stupid victoria station and @entity6 express - all delayed meaning i missed my flight			2
4 hours to kill now at @entity6			2
' @entity111 added : ' @ @entity113 we 've been stuck over 40 mins how much longer people are going to miss their flights soon			2
' and @entity115 wrote : ' @ @entity116 advise on the delay			0
we have been on the train 1 hour & no info on arrival time			0
' scene : following the delays , parts of @entity6 looked almost totally deserted empty : many customers complained that they were unable to get to the airport in time for their flights @entity5 was also hit by technical problems , as the power failed in a satellite terminal and the track transit which takes passengers there			1
authorities said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and that passengers were being taken by bus to their flights			2
at @entity141 airport , 60mph winds meant planes had to abort landing attempts and fly to @entity144 instead			0
flights from @entity146 , in the @entity147 , and @entity148 were cancelled			0
at @entity150 , ferry passengers were held up by a train that broke down between @entity152 and @entity153			0
buses replaced trains from @entity156 to @entity157			0
meanwhile , no trains ran between @entity159 in @entity68 and @entity160 due to staff shortages			0
in @entity163 , @entity164 , services were cancelled after trees fell on overhead wires , while in @entity168 floods stopped trains from @entity170 to @entity171			0
and drivers sat in traffic for at least three hours on the @entity175 southbound , with junctions 16 to 17 near @entity177 closed after an accident .			0

power failure at @entity5 cause queues as long as terminal building
signalling problems at @entity6 meant no trains could run for 45 minutes
services were *heavily* delayed all day thanks to the knock - on effect
angry passengers wrote on @entity90 that they were likely to miss flights
