by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 19:43 est , 1 june 2012 a patient who complained about the treatment she and a frail blind woman received at the hands of a poorly - trained nurse was branded a racist			1
@entity7 , 50 , had only gone into hospital for a simple operation to relieve her acid reflux , but following complications was left with a punctured right lung			1
she had to stay in for an extra two weeks and was put on morphine and oxygen to cope with her pain			2
accusations : @entity7 ( right ) complained about the treatment at @entity19 and @entity20 hospital only to be told she was a racist by staff nurse @entity22 but further problems arose when her morphine drip and oxygen needed replenishing over a weekend			1
astonishingly , the staff on duty had not been trained in how to insert a ‘ cannula ’ needle into her hand , and struggled to provide new oxygen , leaving her in excruciating pain			1
when she was given morphine orally instead , and began hallucinating and crying , a member of staff told her off			0
her patience finally snapped when a nurse fed hot soup to a blind patient in the bed next to her , leaving her blistered and screaming			1
mrs @entity7 told the junior nurse – who happened to be black – that she should have tested the temperature of the soup before serving it			1
moments later the nurse ’s superior , staff nurse @entity22 – who is also black – arrived in the ward , and told horrified mrs @entity7 : ‘ you ’re racist			1
’ despite being in great pain , the patient grabbed a @entity52 frame and tried to leave the hospital			1
now , following a complaint , the @entity19 and @entity20 hospital in @entity55 has apologised for her appalling treatment			2
@entity7 , 50 , had only gone into hospital for a simple operation to relieve her acid reflux , but following complications was left with a punctured right lung last night mrs @entity7 , of @entity63 in @entity64 , said : ‘ i was called a racist for complaining about a lady getting scalded , and because no one was able to fix my morphine over the whole weekend			1
it was a horrific experience			0
‘ i was in terrible pain , and because it was over the weekend no one could do anything about it			0
‘ i was scared to be on the ward , and about what might happen while i was asleep			0
‘ at one stage i even took a @entity52 frame and tried to get out so i could call for help on the street			0
‘ i never want to go there again , however ill i am			0
’ following her complaint , senior nurse @entity80 admitted in a long letter : ‘ it is recognised that there are indeed less doctors working at the weekend , which unfortunately resulted in a severe delay in reviewing your pain relief , which is not acceptable			2
‘ you also described how nurse @entity91 did not know how to change the oxygen			2
she was relatively new to the ward , not very confident , and has learnt from the experience			0
‘ and you described how nurse @entity22 accused you of being racist			2
' the behaviour you described will not be tolerated and is not acceptable			0
i will be monitoring her communication skills			0
’ contacted at her home in @entity100 , @entity101 , mrs @entity22 , whose husband @entity102 , 54 , is a director of a private nursing business , refused to comment .			0
