she said : ' i was so shocked to find that i was pregnant again			0
i had been taking my pill carefully and never in a million years did i expect to end up with triplets			0
' i was on the pill when i fell pregnant with @entity35 , but i had n't really been that careful in making sure i took it at the same time			1
' after i had him , i was so strict about taking my pill every day as according to instructions - i took it religiously at the same time every single day			2
' there was no way on earth i ever thought i 'd end up pregnant again			0
' but she suspected something was up when she randomly began to start feeling sick			2
' i was at a bonfire party when i did n't know if i wanted to eat a burger or be sick			0
my hormones were all over the place and i recognised the feeling from my first pregnancy , but i told myself i could n't be pregnant as i had been taking my pill			2
' the couple were in for more even more of a shock when they attended their first scan and the nurse broke the news they were expecting triplets the boys arrived four months ago and are all in perfect health			1

@entity4 , 22 , says she took the drug at the same time every day
had become pregnant before on the @entity150 so was extra careful
but when she began to feel sick , she knew something was *wrong*
she and partner @entity26 astounded to be told they were expecting triplets
odds of having non-identical triplets are 25,000 to one , doctors say
and situation only usually occurs with the help of @entity13
@entity166 , @entity16 and @entity17 arrived four months ago and are in perfect health
miss @entity4 is now planning to have the contraceptive implant instead
