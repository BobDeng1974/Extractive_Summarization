by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 7 june 2013 @entity1 has been condemned for missing all of its punctuality targets across @entity4 and @entity5 – a finding that will come as little surprise to millions of regular train passengers			2
the rail infrastructure firm – whose top five directors were awarded annual bonuses totalling more than £ 350,000 – was blamed for 61 per cent of all trains running late over the past year			1
that rises to 70 per cent on the key @entity16 mainline from @entity17 to @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
. failures by @entity1 caused trains to be delayed for millions of minutes the rail infrastructure firm was responsible for the majority of delays on most lines , the damning new report showed of the 657,000 trains which ran late during the past 12 months , @entity1 was responsible for 401,000 of them , say watchdogs			1
their damning report lists a catalogue of failures from punctuality to passenger disruption and concludes that @entity1 ‘ must do better ’			1
more than 70,500 long - distance services were either cancelled or ran more than ten minutes late – putting @entity1 on track for a £ 75million fine			0
and more than 361,000 train services in @entity17 and the @entity41 were either cancelled or more than five minutes late last year , according to the report by the @entity43			1

’ shadow transport secretary @entity71 said : ‘ it is not good enough that commuters are facing so many delayed and cancelled trains , despite inflation - busting fare rises and huge public investment in our railways			1
