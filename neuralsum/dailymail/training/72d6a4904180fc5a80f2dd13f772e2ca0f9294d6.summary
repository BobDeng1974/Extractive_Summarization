by @entity0 @entity1 has become the latest of an increasing number of @entity4 states to bring in legislation against revenge porn			1
legal experts called the new legislation an ' important step ' , but noted that the law only protects against revenge porn published with intent to cause harm , leaving a loophole for third - party sites spreading the images			1
revenge porn is defined as sexually explicit images , initially shared with a partner , appearing online as ‘ payback ’ , often after a relationship has ended			1
the @entity40 was signed into @entity1 state law on monday by governor @entity42			0
it outlaws the publication of intimate images with intent to cause emotional stress or harm			2
this means that the law covers person - on - person revenge , but does not make it illegal to run revenge porn websites where images are often tied to the person ’s name , address and phone number			1
to add insult to injury , it is not unheard of for revenge porn sites to offer ' reputation protection services ' where they take the photographs or video down in return for money – essentially blackmail			2
loophole : although the new @entity1 law protects against sharing intimate pictures published with the intention to cause harm , it does not protect against ' revenge porn websites ' as a result , @entity76 , a law professor at the @entity77 who is helping states draft revenge porn laws , said she was extremely disappointed with the law			1
‘ the harm [ those webmasters ] in fact cause victims is no less serious than the vengeful ex-partner , ’ professor @entity82 told @entity83			0
‘ this requirement gives people a free pass to ruin lives using sexually explicit images so long as they can plausibly argue they had some other motive other than harassment or causing distress			2
’ in an interview last year , professor @entity82 explained further that sharing a nude picture with another person implies limited consent similar to other business transactions			0
' if you give your credit card to a waiter , you are n't giving him permission to buy a yacht , ' @entity82 said			0
in @entity34 , where spurned lovers who post graphic images of an ex face prison sentence while those convicted of malicious intent could also be fined $ 1,000 , a website owner has just been arrested after extorting thousands of dollars from his victims			0
fighting back : several @entity4 states now have some form of legislation against revenge porn , as well as countries like @entity121 and @entity122 @entity123 has been charged with 31 offences pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in to a revenge porn website he ran			1
and while it may be easy to dismiss revenge porn as a side - line issue , research from the @entity132 recently showed that more than half ( 52.3 per cent ) of young adults have engaged in ' unwanted but consensual sexting with a committed partner			2
' the precise scope of the problem is unclear because many victims never come forward or are frequently turned away by the police			0
suing for civil damages is another option , but that , too , means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner			0
the revenge porn - phenomenon is as border-less as the internet , and several countries have now introduced legislation against it			0
in january this year , @entity121 and @entity122 passed against revenge porn , with @entity153 member @entity152 , who introduced the law , called the phenomenon ' virtual rape ' .			1

@entity1 bans publishing intimate images with intention of causing distress
revenge porn already outlawed in some form in five other @entity4 states
new law *criticized* for not covering websites distributing revenge porn
earlier this year it was also made illegal in @entity121 and @entity122
