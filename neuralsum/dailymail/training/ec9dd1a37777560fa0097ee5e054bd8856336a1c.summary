@entity0 , who is involved in a new master 's degree in @entity34 at @entity35 , said : ' football , and sport in general , has never been more exciting with a global audience transforming the financial infrastructure of so many businesses but to manage that growth they have to change and change quickly			2
' football has seen perhaps the biggest growth and one man can not run the club in the way sir @entity10 did			2
' in 1995 when i won the @entity49 with @entity1 against @entity2 , i had a total of seven back - room staff			0
since then , with the explosion of the @entity54 and sport developing into global brands , organisations have evolved into complex and sophisticated structures			0
' sports science , sports medicine and sports psychology have become an everyday part of an armoury in all sports			0
as a result there is a need to make sure these well - equipped organisations run smoothly and efficiently in high performance , high pressure environments			0
' in the future sporting directors will do this by championing the vision of an organisation , ensuring its staff live and breathe a winning philosophy and create a culture of success on and off the field			0
' fresh start : new @entity2 manager @entity4 will need the support of the club 's owners and board the good @entity86 ( £ 22.8million , @entity87 ) @entity88 ( £ 7million , @entity89 ) @entity90 ( £ 16.5million , @entity89 ) @entity91 ( £ 10.9million , @entity89 ) the bad @entity93 ( £ 35million , @entity87 ) @entity94 ( £ 17million , @entity89 ) @entity95 ( £ 20million , @entity87 ) @entity96 ( £ 13.7million , @entity89 ) one candidate to fill the gap at @entity15 is @entity99 , who has @entity54 experience with both @entity89 and @entity87			1
@entity101 revealed in october last year that the @entity102 is keen on a return to @entity105 's top - flight , having been without a permanent club role since leaving @entity107 in 2012			0
@entity99 spent seven seasons as a @entity110 scout for @entity111 between 1996 and 2003 , helping to find young talent across the continent			0

he returned to @entity102 with @entity121 in 2008 to become the club 's sporting director , before moving to @entity87 as director of football strategy in november 2010			2
