@entity0 has now confirmed that @entity1 has been nixed from the @entity3 lineup following the scandal surrounding his homophobic insults and run - ins with multiple photographers			1
hours after the news broke , @entity1 took time out of filming a movie in @entity10 to tell his side of the story - and place at least a portion of the blame on gay rights advocates who he argues used him as a scapegoat			1
the scandal erupted earlier this month when he was videotaped using a homophobic slur towards a photographer outside of his apartment			1
though recordings of the events make it appear that he called the man a ' c * * * * * * * * * * f * * , ' @entity1 has maintained that he said ' c * * * * * * * * * * fathead '			2
he has since apologized for saying the first half of the slur , claiming he did not know that it was derogative towards homosexuals			0
' if i called him ' cocksucking maggot ' or a ' c * * * * * * * * * * motherf * * * * * ' ... ' f * * * * * ' is not the word that came out of my mouth			0
that i know , ' @entity1 told local blog @entity41 by phone on tuesday evening			2
' but you 've got the fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy — @entity47 and @entity48 — they 're out there , they 've got you			1
@entity47 , this is probably one of his greatest triumphs			2
off the air : @entity1 's show on @entity3 was cancelled following a series of public clashes with photographers ' they killed my show			1
and i have to take some responsibility for that myself			0
' @entity1 's decision to point to @entity47 , a spokesman for @entity64 , in the interview comes as a bit of a surprise since he previously announced via @entity68 that @entity47 was the one who called @entity1 after the incident to explain that ' c * * * * * * * * * * ' was a slur			1
he removed the tweet shortly after posting it , but @entity0 screen - grabbed it and it reads : ' 1 - @entity47 from @ glaad informs me that c'sucker is an anti-gay epithet			1
in which case i apologize and will retire it from my vocabulary			0
' ' 2 - you learn something new every day			0
' both of the men that @entity1 mentioned by name condemned @entity1 publicly , with @entity47 issuing the statement from @entity64 and blogger @entity48 writing a lengthy article on his well - read political blog calling for his show to be taken off the air			1
naming names : @entity1 specifically cited @entity64 's @entity47 ( left ) and blogger @entity48 ( right ) as two members of the ' fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy ' who had him fired called out : @entity64 publicly chastised @entity1 shortly after the incident for his homophobic language - the second time the group has intervened with him this year pleading ignorance : @entity1 offered up an apology in the days after the altercation and this excuse after @entity64 criticized his use of language - which he tweeted but deleted shortly after @entity1 went on to compare himself to @entity3 's other controversial host , @entity106 , who is also facing calls for his resignation after suggesting on - air that something horrific should be done to former @entity112 governor @entity111			1
@entity3 has not made any statements about the fate of @entity106 's show but the host apologized to @entity111 and she accepted it			1
bringing him into it : @entity1 cited the fact that @entity3 has not fired @entity106 for making highly inappropriate comments about @entity111 ' @entity106 's on the air , and he made his comment on the air ! i dispute half the comment i made ... ' @entity1 told @entity41			1
' there 's nothing you can do when you get thrown in this washing machine , nothing			0
all you end up doing is just defending yourself all day long			0
' the actor 's late night talk show ' @entity135 ' was originally suspended for two weeks immediately following his argument with photographers and journalists outside of his @entity140 apartment			1
in a pseudo ' mea culpa ' that the actor wrote following his earlier two episode suspension that preceded the announcement of his show 's cancellation , @entity1 hinted that it may be taken off the air permanently			1
an employee at @entity3 has confirmed to @entity0 on tuesday that the star 's nascent show has been officially cancelled			1

@entity162 : @entity1 retweeted this @entity164 quote just three hours before the news broke supportive : @entity1 's wife @entity167 put up this inspirational message tuesday evening ' the show is not coming back			1
he had questions on whether he wanted to continue , ' the spokesman said			0
not long after their article was published , @entity1 's spokesman @entity172 and @entity3 issued a joint statement to @entity176			1
' we are jointly confirming that @entity179 late will not continue on @entity3 , ' the network said in the statement			1

' ' the decision has been made			0
he ’s gone , ' a different unidentified insider told @entity184			0
' the ( parent company ) @entity186 guys have decided			0
@entity188 is spreading through the building			0
' hours before speaking to @entity41 - which is where he last went to explain himself after getting into an online @entity68 rage against a @entity0 journalist - the actor retweeted an inspirational quote from @entity164 just hours before the news about the @entity3 decision broke on tuesday afternoon			1
' there were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested , but i would not and could not give myself up to dispair , ' the post read			0
confrontation : the reporters were outside his apartment earlier this month following his appearance in court when he testified against his stalker apparently his use of a slur was not the only reason why @entity186 decided to cut the program			2
even before the show was suspended following the run - in with the photographer , it was already struggling			1
the ratings for the show 's fifth week were down 40 per cent from the premiere audience and dropped to 395,000 total viewers			2
the reportedly had difficulty booking guests , as @entity226 actress @entity225 and fellow @entity3 host @entity227 were the two biggest names who appeared on the short - lived program			2
the inside sources also claimed that @entity1 was overly demanding behind the scenes and said that he required a personal humidifier and his own make up room because a woman who he would have been sharing it with has cancer and a sensitivity to hairspray			2
' i do n’t give a f * * * if she has cancer or not , i want that f * * * * * * makeup room , ' he allegedly screamed			0
when the temporary suspension was announced on november 15 , @entity1 hinted that it may not return			2
' whether the show comes back at all is at issue right now , ' he wrote in an essay published on the @entity176			0
' if quitting the television business , the movie business , the theater , any component of entertainment , is necessary in order to bring safety and peace to my family , then that is an easy choice			0
' though he may have been down at that point after having three separate arguments with reporters and photographers in the span of one day , it did n't stop him from taking pot - shots at the competition in the blog post			2
off the air : @entity1 's show was first suspended for two weeks and then cut from the lineup entirely ' if the show dies , its fate ends up being no different than the vast majority of start - up tv programming , and so be it			1
we do take a small amount of pride in knowing that we beat @entity281 in the ratings each of our nights			0
( i forget who they had on at that time			0
) ' ' i have been a fan of @entity3 for some time			0
its left - leaning tone never bothered me			0
i still believe that they are more enamored of and devoted to the truth in any single hour than @entity290 is all year long			0
' in a note that seems like he knew trouble was brewing , he did say that a cancellation of his program may help fellow @entity3 host @entity297 , who he called the ' single most important television journalist on the air today '			2
' if my show does disappear , i will be grateful in so far as her good work , along with that of ( @entity305 ) @entity304 and ( @entity227 ) @entity306 and ( @entity308 ) @entity307 and ( @entity227 ) @entity227 and ( @entity227 ) @entity309 , will not be sullied by my problem , ' he wrote			0
