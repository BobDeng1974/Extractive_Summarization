by @entity0 men who have the snip increase their risk of suffering fatal prostate cancer , according to research			1
a study by @entity8 scientists has found that those who have undergone a vasectomy could be 10 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with the disease			1
the research – the largest ever examination of the link between vasectomy and prostate cancer – involved data from 50,000 men whose health was tracked for 24 years			1
it found men who had the procedure were at an increased risk of getting an advanced or lethal form of the disease			1
a study by scientists at @entity27 found having a vasectomy - a common form of contraception - is linked to a 10 per cent increased risk of developing the most lethal form of prostate cancer vasectomy is a common form of contraception and is more popular in @entity36 than almost anywhere else in the world			1
some 16 per cent of @entity36 men under 70 have had the operation			1
prostate cancer is the second - leading cause of cancer death among men			2
the researchers , whose work was published in the @entity48 , analysed the health records of 49,405 @entity51 men who were followed between 1986 and 2010			0
during that time , 6,023 cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed , including 811 lethal cases			0
one in four of the men in the study reported having a vasectomy			0
the researchers found the men who had a vasectomy had a particularly raised risk of developing the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer which are most likely to kill			1
they had a 20 per cent raised risk of getting an advanced form of the disease and a 19 per cent raised risk of dying			2
the authors emphasised that their study had only established a statistical link between the operation and the disease – and they did not suggest that vasectomies were directly causing the cancer			2
they concluded , however , that urgent investigation was needed to establish if and why the surgical procedure might be increasing the numbers of those with cancer			0
they wrote : ‘ the findings of this study warrant continued epidemiologic and experimental research into clarifying the association of vasectomy with prostate cancer			0
’ prostate cancer , pictured under the microscope , is the second - leading cause of cancer death among men			0
men who had a vasectomy had a particularly raised risk of developing the forms of the cancer most likely to kill author @entity97 said : ‘ the decision to opt for a vasectomy as a form of birth control is a highly personal one and a man should discuss the risks and benefits with his physician			1
’ co-author @entity106 , associate professor of epidemiology at @entity108 , added : ‘ the results support the hypothesis that vasectomy is associated with an increased risk of advanced or lethal prostate cancer			1
’ but he pointed out that although the results are statistically significant , in terms of absolute risk the figures are low			0
just 16 out of every 1,000 men in the study died from prostate cancer over a 24 - year period			1
a vasectomy is considered a safe operation , but , even disregarding the new findings , there are risks associated with the procedure			0
they include infections , long term testicular pain , blood clots in the tissue surrounding the operated area and hematomas – painful lumps in the scrotum			0
in a very small number of cases – around one in every 2,000 – the tubes that are cut during the vasectomy reconnect themselves , effectively reversing the procedure and making a man fertile again			0
apart from condoms , having a vasectomy is the only form of male contraceptive , a situation scientists have been trying to improve upon for decades			2
researchers are confident a hormonal contraceptive for men will be found in the next few years , most likely in the form of an oral tablet similar to the pill taken by women			2
but a radical alternative route being considered by some scientists is a ‘ chemical vasectomy ’ , which would use medication to stop sperm leaving the body during sex .			0
