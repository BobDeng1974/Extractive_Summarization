@entity0 in @entity1 has formed an all - girl choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history by @entity5 published : 08:00 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 03:04 est , 18 december 2012 a cathedral has formed an all - female choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history			1
the 14 girls - aged from seven to 17 - are the first female singers to lead services at @entity0 in @entity1 since it was established in the 6th century			1
many cathedrals have traditionally always had all - male choirs but @entity14 of @entity0 , @entity15 , said the institutions are now waking up to the fact ' girls can sing as well as boys '			1
girl power : @entity0 in @entity1 has an all - female choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history time for equality : the 14 girls - aged from seven to 17 - are the first female singers to lead services at the cathedral since it was established in the 6th century he said : ' there was a perception that the purest form of treble voice is that of a young boy			1
but slowly all cathedrals are realising that , actually , girls can sing as well as boys			0
' @entity0 has broken its own ancient tradition going back to 575 ad of only allowing boys and men to sing this @entity38 with their all - girl group			1
the dean of @entity0 , the @entity42 dr @entity41 , said the all - girls choir was her idea and she 's delighted it has now come into fruition			1
she said : ' i saw it as my mission to try and encourage and bring girls into the worshiping life of the cathedral			0
' there is a problem getting boys to join the cathedral choir			2
i think it 's not cool in society for boys to be part of a choral tradition			0
' after 1,437 years , this marks the beginning of a new part of our choral tradition here			2
it is a natural development that will help to ensure that both boys and girls will be in the choirs , which sing praises for many years to come			0
' choirs of men and boys have been singing in the cathedrals and chapels of @entity76 , almost without interruption , for more than a thousand years			0
new chapter : as choir numbers were dwlndling because it was n't seen as ' cool ' for boys , allowing girls to take part could help prevent the tradition dying out in @entity76 more than 70 still sing regularly for worship - and that number could rise with the introduction of female choirs			1
but director of the new all - girls choir @entity91 said it would take a few years before the group rivalled the men 's choir			2
he said : ' this choir is in its infancy			0
it will take us a year or two to establish a repertoire and to make sure we know what we are doing			0
' but i think they will be absolutely brilliant and on an equal footing with any choir in the land			0
' @entity107 , 15 , said the first all - girls choir was a big step in securing the cathedral 's choral tradition			2
she said : ' there has been quite a bit of pressure but things are moving with the times now			0
i think if we do n't have a girls choir the choral tradition might die out			0
' the all - girls choir will sing at evensong in @entity0 every monday during term time			1
girls allowed : the choir will sing at evensong in @entity0 every monday during term time breaking with tradition : @entity0 was established in the 6th century and has now opened its choir doors to women			1
