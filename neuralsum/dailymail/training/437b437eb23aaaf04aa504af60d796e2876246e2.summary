@entity0 had food poisoning caused by campylobacter bacteria @entity0 had invited his 19 - year - old grandson , @entity3 , over for a meal and had made a special effort with the menu , starting with home - made vegetable soup , which was followed by roast chicken breast with new potatoes and peas , then chocolate mousse			1
' i see quite a bit of @entity3 because he studies at university in @entity16 , which is where i live , ' says 79 - year - old @entity0 , a retired consultant structural engineer who lives alone			1
' i enjoy cooking when it 's not just for me			2
' but that night in february left @entity0 with a nasty stomach bug that kept him housebound for nearly a week and led to him losing 9lb in just a few days			1
he had contracted a campylobacter infection - and is thought to have caught it when he washed the chicken before cooking it			1
it was something he , like nearly half of the population , had always done , little realising how risky it could be for health			0
yesterday the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) warned people to stop washing chicken before they cook it because of the risk of spreading the deadly bacteria			1
campylobacter bacteria are the most common cause of food poisoning in the @entity39 , affecting an estimated 280,000 @entity39 a year - and are to blame for more cases than @entity41 , salmonella and listeria put together			1
' often people do n't report their symptoms , so the true number of cases is likely to be even higher , ' says @entity47 , a microbiologist and head of food - borne diseases strategy at the @entity31			1
around 80 per cent of these cases have been traced to contaminated poultry - it 's thought that two â€‘ thirds of chicken carries the bacteria , says mr @entity47			1
laboratory tests on samples from infected people have found they contain the same campylobacter dna found specifically in chicken			2
other sources of the bacteria include raw meat , unpasteurised milk and untreated water			1
campylobacter is said to never be more than 3ft from a chicken shed , he says , adding that the @entity31 is working with the poultry supply industry in the @entity39 to reduce the amount of the bacteria on chicken			2
but a key problem is that many of us are unwittingly spreading it by washing raw chicken			1
as many as 44 per cent of people always wash chicken before cooking it , according to the @entity31 - usually because they think it gets rid of germs or the blood			1
washing raw chicken seems to be something you either do or do n't do , ' perhaps depending if your parents did it ' , adds dr @entity83 , a microbiologist at @entity84 in @entity85			1
' we know the droplets from washing chicken under a kitchen tap can travel up to a metre , ' says mr @entity47			2
and just a few campylobacter cells are needed to cause disease and food poisoning , adds dr @entity113			1
this wo n't occur as soon as you 've eaten the contaminated foods - it can take between one and five days before you start feeling unwell			2
the symptoms are caused when the bacteria reach the epithelial cells that line the stomach - ' they have a toxic effect in us which triggers inflammation , and that causes symptoms , ' explains dr @entity113			2
in around half of the cases , the illness starts with 24 - hour flu - like symptoms			0
it progresses to profuse diarrhoea that can contain blood , vomiting , abdominal pains and cramps that may resemble appendicitis			0
typically , it lasts around a week			0
' it is a severe illness that you do n't get over after a day , ' adds mr @entity47			0
drinking water helps , as this replaces the fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhoea - the body 's ability to fight the bug is compromised if it is dehydrated			1
the worry is that in around a quarter of patients , the bacteria can trigger a number of conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity154 )			0
' this is due to an irreversible change in the lining of the gut , ' says mr @entity47			0
this can last for years in some cases			0
one possible cause is a toxin produced by the bacteria - research has shown this can disrupt bowel function			2
the infection may also damage nerves lining the gut , responsible for gut motility ( the normal movement of waste through the system ) and sensation , leading to altered bowel movements and increased awareness of pain in the gastro - intestinal tract			2
in around 1 per cent of cases , campylobacter can trigger ' reactive ' arthritis , which is usually short term but can sometimes become chronic , says mr @entity47			0
here , inflammation - redness and swelling - are triggered in response to an infection			2
this most commonly affects the joints ( leading to pain and stiffness ) , the eyes ( causing conjunctivitis ) and the urethra ( leading to pain when urinating )			0
the joint pain typically comes on two to four weeks after the infection has passed			0
another more alarming condition , @entity196 , is strongly linked to campylo - @entity197 rare , it usually occurs after a viral or bacterial infection , which may trigger the immune system to attack nerve roots and peripheral nerves , causing partial paralysis and sometimes even death			0
around 1,200 people a year suffer from it			0
while anyone can get campylobacter food poisoning or the serious complications , the under - fives and over- 60s are at a slightly increased risk because their immune systems tend to be weaker , says mr @entity47			1
there is no reason to clean chicken or wash off visible blood - it does n't make it any more hygienic taking medications that affect production of stomach acid can also make you more vulnerable to a campylobacter infection			1
for instance , those taking proton pump inhibitors , which reduce the production of stomach acid , might be more susceptible because the acid in the stomach can kill the bacteria			0
usually drinking lots of water and taking oral rehydration salts to avoid dehydration , resting and eating easily digested foods if you feel up to it is enough to treat a campylobacter infection			1
antibiotics may be prescribed if symptoms are severe			0
if the symptoms last more than a couple of days or are particularly severe , such as blood being present in the stools , see your gp or call the 111 helpline if you 're worried about leaving the house , adds mr @entity47			0
the consequences of washing chicken were not immediate for @entity0			2
he started feeling ' vaguely unwell ' three days later ; his grandson @entity3 did n't become ill , possibly because the bacteria only splashed onto @entity0 's food or hands			1
@entity0 woke that morning with an upset tummy			0
for the next four days , he was rushing to the lavatory so was stuck indoors and did n't feel like eating			0
he decided to chance leaving the house to see his gp , who prescribed a medicine to stop the diarrhoea			0
by the following day he had started to improve			0
his doctor asked @entity0 to give a stool sample - standard practice for anyone with severe symptoms - which was then tested and found to contain campylobacter			1
@entity270 contacted @entity0 to try to determine the source of the bacteria - this usually happens only when it 's thought the cause might be linked to an establishment that sells food			1
' someone mentioned raw chicken and asked if i 'd washed it , ' explains @entity0 , who was back to full strength a couple of weeks later			1
' because i had n't been out to eat , it was the most obvious cause			0
i was surprised something so routine was to blame			0
i stayed in bed most of the time , as i felt so rotten			0
' there should be notices on chicken telling people not to wash it because most do n't realise			2
' what happened has made me wonder what goes on in kitchens , and i prefer eating out at places where i can see the food being prepared			0
i have n't eaten chicken since , but i certainly wo n't wash it again			1
' for days @entity0 was rushing to the lavatory so was stuck indoors and did n't feel like eating there are steps consumers can take to protect themselves from campylobacter , says microbiologist @entity47 , from the @entity31 :			1

@entity0 , 79 , from @entity16 had a nasty stomach bug in february
it followed a chicken meal , and kept him housebound for nearly a week
contracted a campylobacter infection - common cause of food poisoning
thought to have caught it when he washed the chicken before cooking it
do n't wash raw chicken . there is no reason to clean chicken or wash off visible blood - it does n't make it any more hygienic or remove bugs .
use separate chopping boards for chicken and other *ingredients* , such as salad and vegetables .
*disinfect* surfaces , *dishcloths* , sponges and *utensils* that raw chicken has come into contact with to avoid spreading the bacteria around the kitchen .
when possible , clean them in the *dishwasher* , as the *combination* of heat , water and *detergent* kills the bugs . clean work surfaces or other items with hot water and an *anti-microbial* *disinfect*ant , such as a bleach spray .
make sure the chicken is cooked *properly* - either by checking with a *temperature* probe that it 's *70c* or by making sure the meat is n't pink - and that the *juices* running out of it are clear
