@entity2 was jailed for two - and - a - half years after turning to dealing to supplement his pension			1
his operation was foiled when police raided his bungalow and found books on how to grow the class b drug			1
officers seized £ 1,391 in cash , scales containing traces of cocaine and invoices for equipment from his home			2
the grey - haired pensioner - nicknamed @entity22 - also had keys to an industrial unit in his @entity27 van			2
police searched the unit , in @entity30 , @entity31 , and found 182 skunk plants with a street value of £ 70,000			2
@entity2 ’s fingerprints were found on a lightbulb and on one of three separate growing areas			1
@entity39 @entity38 heard @entity2 had been released from prison on licence for others drugs offences			1
but he returned to crime when he wrongly thought he owed £ 38,000 for a previous confiscation order made by the courts			2
in mitigation , it was claimed he was paid just £ 300 for acting as a caretaker and looking after the crop			0
busted : @entity2 was sentenced to two - and - a - half years in prison at @entity51 ( above ) for growing 182 cannabis plants but judge @entity53 ruled that @entity2 played a significant role in the operation			1
@entity2 , from @entity30 , pleaded guilty to one count of producing a class b drug between april and august last year			1
judge @entity53 said : ' i take account of your age - you are nearly 84 - you must be the country ’s oldest drug dealer and you are in ill health			0
' having said that , you have numerous previous convictions for drug offences with numerous custodial sentences that arose from those offences			0
' it ’s a very sad day when i have to sentence an 83 - year - old , nearly 84 - year - old , man for offences like these			0
' an order was made for the drugs to be forfeited and destroyed			0
as he begins his sentence , neighbours in @entity77 described their shock that softly - spoken @entity2 could have concealed such a crime			1
one resident , who did not want to be named , said : ' he seemed like a very respectable , elderly gentleman and i never saw anything to suggest he was up to anything dodgy			0
' this is a quiet residential street packed with children and elderly people			0
i did n’t expect a dealer to be living in that house			0
