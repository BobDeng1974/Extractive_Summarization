by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:36 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:01 est , 23 december 2013 astronauts removed an old space station pump saturday , sailing through the first of a series of urgent repair spacewalks to revive a crippled cooling line			1
the two @entity12 on the crew , @entity9 and @entity10 , successfully pulled out the ammonia pump with a bad valve well ahead of schedule			1
that task had been planned for the next spacewalk , originally scheduled for monday but now delayed until tuesday , @entity18 , because of the need for a suit swap			0
' an early @entity18 , ' observed @entity21 as @entity9 tugged the refrigerator - size pump away from its nesting spot			1
faulty : aging spacesuits have proven to be a challenge for astronauts attempting to fix the @entity27 space walk : astronauts @entity30 and @entity10 embark on a risky space walk to fix a cooling pipe drowning : astronauts risked drowning while fixing the @entity27 because of aging spacesuits if @entity9 and @entity10 keep up the quick work , two spacewalks may be enough to complete the installation of a spare pump and a third spacewalk will not be needed as originally anticipated			1
several hours after saturday 's spacewalk ended , @entity21 bumped spacewalk 2 to tuesday to give @entity9 enough time to prepare a spare suit			1
his original suit was compromised when he inadvertently turned on a water switch in the air lock at the end of saturday 's excursion			2
@entity49 officials said saturday night that it 's unclear whether a third spacewalk will be needed and when it might occur , if required			1
a third spacewalk had been slated for christmas day before the latest turn of events			2
@entity49 requires a day off between spacewalks for astronaut rest			0
the space station breakdown 10 days earlier left one of two identical cooling loops too cold and forced the astronauts to turn off all nonessential equipment inside the orbiting lab , bringing scientific research to a near - halt and leaving the station in a vulnerable state			1
@entity21 wanted to keep the spacewalkers out even longer saturday to get even further ahead , but a cold and uncomfortable @entity9 requested to go back			1
the spacewalk ended after 5Â½ hours , an hour short on time but satisfyingly long on content			0
risk : the suits used by the astronauts have a history of leaking liquid into the helmet from an internal cooling system earlier , @entity9 managed to unhook all the ammonia fluid and electrical lines on the pump with relative ease , occasionally releasing a flurry of frozen ammonia flakes that brushed against his suit			1
a small o - ring floated away , but he managed to retrieve it			0
' i got it , i got it , i got it			0
barely , ' @entity9 said as he stretched out his hand			1
' do n't let that go , that 's a stocking stuffer , ' @entity21 replied			2
' do n't tell my wife , ' @entity9 said , chuckling , as he put it in a small pouch for trash			2
@entity9 , a seven - time spacewalker , and @entity10 , making his first , wore extra safety gear as they worked outside			1
@entity49 wanted to prevent a recurrence of the helmet flooding that nearly drowned an @entity103 astronaut last summer , so saturday 's spacewalkers had snorkels in their suits and water - absorbent pads in their helmets			2
to everyone 's relief , the spacewalkers remained dry while outside			2
but midway through the excursion , @entity9 's toes were so cold that he had to crank up the heat in his boots			1
@entity21 worried aloud whether it was wise to extend the spacewalk to get ahead , given @entity9 's discomfort			1
not quite two hours later , @entity9 had enough as he clutched the old pump			1
when @entity21 suggested even more get - ahead chores , he replied , ' i 'd like to stow this old module and kind of clean up and call it a day			0
' he said a couple of things were bothering him , not just temperature , and declined to elaborate when asked by @entity21 what was wrong			0
system down : the cooling system in the @entity27 needs to be repaired in order for the astronauts to complete their mission flight controllers obliged him			1
once the old pump was secured to a temporary location , the spacewalkers started gathering up their tools to go in			0
adding to the excitement 260 miles ( 418 kilometers ) up , a smoke alarm went off in the space station as the astronauts toiled outside			2
it was quickly found to be a false alarm			0
the pump replacement is a huge undertaking attempted only once before , back in 2010 on this very unit			0
the two astronauts who tackled the job three years ago were in @entity21 , offering guidance			0
@entity9 promised to bring back a wire tie installed on the pump by the previous spacewalkers			1
' oh , awesome , thanks @entity153 , ' replied the astronaut in @entity21 who put it on			0
the 780 - pound ( 354 - kilogram ) pump is about the size of a double - door refrigerator and extremely cumbersome to handle , with plumbing full of toxic ammonia			2
any traces of ammonia on the spacesuits were dissipated before the astronauts went back inside , to avoid further contamination			2
@entity49 's plan initially called for the pump to be disconnected in the first spacewalk , pulled out on the second spacewalk and a fresh spare put in , and then all the hookups of the new pump completed in the third outing			1
urgent : the broken cooling equipment on the @entity27 has required three , risky space walks in the days following the dec. 11 breakdown , flight controllers attempted in vain to fix the bad valve through remote commanding			1
then they tried using a different valve to regulate the temperature of the overly cold loop , with some success			0
but last tuesday , @entity49 decided the situation was severe enough to press ahead with the spacewalks			0
although the astronauts were safe and comfortable , @entity49 did not want to risk another failure and a potential loss of the entire cooling system , needed to radiate the heat generated by on - board equipment			1
@entity49 delayed a delivery mission from @entity193 , @entity194 , to accommodate the spacewalks			0
that flight by the private firm @entity197 , which should have occurred this past week , is now targeted for jan. 7			0
until saturday , @entity12 spacewalks had been on hold since july , when an @entity103 astronaut 's helmet was flooded with water from the cooling system of his suit			2
@entity205 barely got back inside alive			0
engineers traced the problem to a device in the suit that turned out to be contaminated â € ” how and why , no one yet knows			0
for saturday 's spacewalk , @entity10 wore @entity205 's suit , albeit with newly installed and thoroughly tested components			1
just in case , @entity49 had @entity9 and @entity10 build snorkels out of plastic tubing from their suits , before going out			1
the snorkels will be used in case water starts building up in their helmets			0
they also put absorbent pads in their helmets ; the pads were launched from @entity224 following the july scare			0
none of the precautions were needed , in the end			0
besides the two @entity12 , three @entity230 and one @entity232 astronaut are living on the space station , all men .			0

astronauts @entity9 and @entity10 , successfully pulled out the ammonia pump on the @entity27 after two risky space walks
the breakdown left one of two identical cooling loops too cold and forced the astronauts to turn off all nonessential equipment
it 's unclear whether a third space walk will be necessary to fix the broken pump
