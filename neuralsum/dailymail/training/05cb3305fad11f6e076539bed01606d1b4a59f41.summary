by @entity0 during a typical @entity3 summer , there are very few opportunities to lie on the beach and feel the hot sand beneath you			0
so when families in @entity10 , @entity11 , visited what they thought was a golden stretch of shoreline to relax in the glorious sunshine - they were furious to find @entity16 covered in seaweed			1
but instead of heading home , many decided to dig their way through four inches of slippery , stinking sludge on the half - mile stretch of coast , determined to relax on the bright green beach			1
green with envy ? sunbathers were forced to clear away a carpet of seaweed on @entity16 in @entity10 , @entity11 which was four inches deep in some places some people did give up though , blaming the council for failing to clear the seaweed which regularly coats the beach			1
local resident @entity34 , who headed to the popular sunspot on monday with her two grandchildren , said : ' i ’m been going there for 30 years and i ’ve never seen it so bad			0
' it was crispy on top and slimy underneath			0
the smell was absolutely revolting but the colour was remarkable			0
' it was heart - breaking , we had to dig a little hole to find some sand in a pool of seaweed			2
we have got beautiful weather but you ca n’t go on the beach			0
' response : @entity56 , which says the occurrence is a natural phenomenon , cleans the beach on a rota three times a week			1
however this stretch of coast was not scheduled to be cleared that day @entity56 said it cleans its beaches on a rota and it just so happened that @entity66 had n’t been scheduled for a clean - up that day			1
a spokesman said : ' there is a rota for beach cleaning - usually three beaches each day - and @entity66 is cleared on tuesdays , wednesdays or fridays , depending on the suitability of the tides and how busy the beach is			1
' this year there has been one complaint from a member of the public about seaweed on beaches			0
' it is widely understood that the tide and the sea will generate this natural occurrence , especially in the summer , and that @entity56 has a reliable and appropriate system in place for its removal with minimal disruption to beach users			2
' the council have since cleaned up the beach			0
however , the overcast conditions meant there was only one sunbather - with a tent and a windshield - on the beach			2
cleared : the council has now removed the carpet of seaweed that covered @entity16			1
however , the overcast conditions meant there was only one sunbather - with a tent and wind shield - on the beach			0

determined families relaxed on seaweed on @entity16 in @entity10 , @entity11 when they fancied *soaking* up some sun
they found half - mile stretch of coast completely covered in four inches of bright green , slippery , stinking seaweed
@entity56 cleans the beach three times a week and *claimed* the stretch of *coastline* had not been seen that day
