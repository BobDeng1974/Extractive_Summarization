by @entity0 if you want to know what it means to have @entity4 back and playing at the 143rd @entity7 , then the first tee at @entity6 on sunday was a pretty good place to start			1
sundays before any major are usually venues of tranquillity before the madness descends			0
when world no 1 @entity14 walked down the opening hole , there were precisely zero spectators accompanying him			2
practically everyone else in the field will not have 3,000 people walking around with them next sunday , never mind this one			0
after disappointing attendance figures at @entity64 last year , it must have gladdened the hearts of the @entity66 to see so many people			0
more than 230,000 crammed into @entity21 last time , and while there wo n’t be that many this week — there was the novelty element of it being the first @entity7 to be staged there since 1967 — you can see why they ’re hopeful the 200,000 barrier will be broken			1
tee break : @entity4 discusses course tactics with his caddy during the practice session back in the day : @entity4 last competed at @entity21 for the 135th @entity7 in 2006 shadow of his former self ? @entity4 holds aloft the @entity81 after winning the 2006 @entity7 december 2002injury : surgery to remove fluid and cysts from left anterior cruciate ligament.on his return : @entity87 : cartilage surgery on left knee.on his return : won @entity91 @entity90 / june @entity92 : double stress fracture in left tibia and reconstruction of left anterior cruciate @entity85 his return : tied 9th in @entity98 @entity92 : ruptured right achilles.on his return : lost in 2nd rnd of @entity101 : inflamed joint in neck			1
on his return : tied 19th in @entity106 / may @entity105 : strained left achilles playing in the masters ; pain in left calf and sprained medial cruciate ligament in left knee			0
on his return : tied 37th in @entity114 : soreness in left @entity116			0
on his return : won @entity118 @entity119 : strained left elbow			2
on his return : tied sixth in the @entity122 : back spasms			2
on his return : tied 65th in the @entity124 : surgery on pinched nerve in back			2
on his return : missed cut in @entity130			0
what ’s clear already is @entity4 ’s strategy will not be far removed from the one he adopted in 2006 , when he used only one driver all week			1
the years might have taken a tumultuous toll , from the series of injuries to the divorce to the sex scandal to the blessing of two healthy kids			0
but off many of the tees it will all start this week like it did back then , with a two iron ‘ stinger ’ to take the fairway bunkers out of play			1
the first hole was playing into a decent breeze on sunday , fortifying it with sufficient length to lure practically everyone into striking some kind of metal wood			0
he reached straight for the club he might well have worn out by the end of the tournament			2
how did the swing look , in only @entity4 ’s second tournament back after four months out following back surgery ? really good , actually			1
he was swinging about three - quarter pace and looked all the better for it			0
@entity4 said he was glad to be back and sounded it			1
believe it or not , he could n’t keep a smile off his face			0
‘ taking baby steps over the past four months has paid off and now i am at that point where i can do what i want , ’ he beamed			0
alongside him was world no 5 @entity172			1
the @entity91 was candid enough to admit he thought @entity4 ‘ crazy ’ to make his comeback two weeks ago when he missed the halfway cut comfortably in his own tournament and was clearly half - fit			1
‘ @entity4 said he wanted to test it			1
now he ’s in the recovery phase and he said he ’s getting up the next day after playing and feeling good , ’ said @entity172			1
the pair had a match going and the personable @entity172 thought it was advantage to him with @entity4 160 yards away in two on the par five 18th			1
‘ then he stuffed it in close there , so that was a bit of a bummer , but more like the @entity4 we ’re used to seeing , ’ he said , smiling			1
club selection : @entity4 is likely to rely on his two iron once the tournament gets underway sand trap : the @entity91 golfer is hoping to take bunkers out of play by steering clear of his woods going green : @entity4 practices his putting as he steps up his recovery from back injury packed to the rafters : more crowds gather as @entity4 tees off at the 3rd the pits : @entity4 ' practice partner @entity199 insists the @entity91 golfer is a contender for @entity7 can @entity4 contend ? ‘ absolutely i think he could , ’ said @entity172			1
‘ the @entity7 , the knowledge he has , the skill set he has … yeah , definitely he could contend			2
’ @entity4 joked around on a number of occasions with the third member of his group , big - hitting @entity91 @entity207			1
not such a big hitter on this occasion , mind , since the only clubs he was carrying were a sand wedge and a putter			0
the other 12 ? ‘ stuck in some airport , ’ he said			0
‘ the airline lost my clubs and my luggage			0
’ it happens to them too , then			0
woods arrived on saturday afternoon and is such a creature of habit that he teed off within 10 minutes or so of the time he started his preparations in 2006			2
hat 's entertainment ! whatever the outcome , @entity227 ' return is good for golf there does n’t seem to be any realistic hope he will end the week with a similar result but it is surely time the analysts laid off with their negative carping			0
a typical wail is : why did n’t he get competitive reps in at the @entity240 last week ? when you think most people did n’t believe we would see him again until late in the year , is n’t it acceptable to ease his way back into the heat of competition ? @entity21 looks a lot different to the parched beauty we saw in 2006 but this is down to improved agronomy techniques rather than the weather			1
in fact , @entity253 chief executive @entity252 is hopeful it will play almost as fast - running as it did back then come thursday , while being green instead of brown			2
good news for @entity4 , then , and his stinger			2
good news for golf .			0
