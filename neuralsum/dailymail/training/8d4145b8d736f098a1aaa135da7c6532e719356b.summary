by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:49 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 28 may 2013 women 's leather belts sold by the fashion website @entity4 have been recalled after the metal studs in them were found to be radioactive			1
about 50 of the belts , retailing at £ 28 , are known to have been bought from the company			1
they were made using cheap contaminated scrap metal in @entity11			0
the peplum leather belts , which tested positive for @entity13 , could injure people if worn for more than 500 hours - and are currently in a radioactive storage facility , an internal company report said			1
it said that one of the belts tested positive after being pulled by @entity21 border control officers , which led to them being withdrawn across the world reported @entity24			1

withdrawal : the peplum leather belts , which tested positive for @entity13 , could injure people if worn for more than 500 hours - and are currently in a radioactive storage facility , an internal @entity4 company report said but the number of studded belts - which were described in the report called @entity36 as being unsuitable for ‘ for public use or possession ’ - that have been returned is not yet known			1
the report , which was produced by an external regulator , said that the incident is ‘ quite a common occurrence ’ and that during the refining process of scrap metal , ‘ orphaned radioactive sources are sometimes accidentally melted at the same time ’			1
this contaminates the process and ‘ traps the radioactivity in the metal as an alloy or in suspension ’			0
@entity53 , the @entity11 group which the firm said supplied the belts , has been supplying @entity4 for more than a year - and allegedly sold 641 radioactive belts to them , reported @entity24			1
retailer : an @entity4 spokesman said the company ' continues to work with the relevant regulatory authorities and is in dialogue with the supplier and the factory workers involved to ensure a satisfactory outcome ' the firm had withheld £ 64,000 owed to the supplier ’s boss @entity67 , who said his factory has had to be shut for five months			0
' there 's no business left , i 'm just sitting at home			0
it 's bad and it ’s a financial headache ' @entity67 , supplier @entity53 he said that this has left 18 @entity11 workers unemployed at the @entity79 factory in @entity80 - and that his car has had to be sold so he can hire a legal team			2
@entity4 has since offered to pay mr @entity67 £ 24,000 of the £ 64,000 he is owed , but he told @entity83 : ‘ there 's no business left , i 'm just sitting at home			0
it 's bad and it ’s a financial headache			0
an @entity4 spokesman said in a statement emailed to @entity83 : ‘ a product supplied to @entity4 did not meet @entity91 health and safety standards			2
‘ @entity4 worked with all relevant authorities and undertook a precautionary product recall , in line with our high standards of quality and customer care			2
no other @entity4 product lines are affected			2
‘ @entity4 continues to work with the relevant regulatory authorities and is in dialogue with the supplier and the factory workers involved to ensure a satisfactory outcome			0
’ the @entity24 also reported that mr @entity67 has been refused permission to inspect the goods			0
but the @entity4 spokesman said it had also been restricted from inspecting the belts due to ' standard regulatory procedure ' on the part of @entity21 authorities .			1
