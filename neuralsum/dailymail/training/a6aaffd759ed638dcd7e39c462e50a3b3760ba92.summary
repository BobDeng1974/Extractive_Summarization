@entity1 administrator @entity0 is hoping to deliver a happy @entity2 present to the team 's 230 staff recently made redundant			1
@entity0 is currently in serious negotiations with a potential buyer who not only has the financial muscle required to compete in @entity9 , but more importantly also has a background in the sport			1
the 54 - year - old @entity12 believes a deal could be completed within the next three to four weeks in the run up to @entity2 , allowing just enough time for the team to be on the grid for next season			1
@entity1 administrator @entity0 is in serious negotiations with a potential buyer ' i am honestly talking to somebody who would like to take this over within the next month , ' @entity0 said			1
' this is somebody who feels the same as me , that if we do n't do something quickly then the team will drift away			0
' this is a credible person with credible backers , somebody linked to @entity9 , and i am delighted about that			0
' talking to people with no @entity9 involvement at all adds that huge risk factor , but this is somebody who knows it and who wants to do it			0
' they 'd like to take it over with the same people and with the same infrastructure , as the same team , and that would be the dream result for me			0
it would be absolutely fantastic			0
' @entity0 has stated it was through @entity1 being in the shop window in @entity50 over the weekend that resulted in the interested party coming forward			1
the @entity54 - based marque went into administration last month , but via a crowdfunding project organised by @entity0 was able to hit their initial £ 2.35million target , actually going over by £ 4,334			2
@entity0 believes a deal could be completed within the next four weeks , allowing enough time for the team to be on the grid for next season @entity1 then put up a credible performance on track with a skeleton staff of just 40 people at the @entity67 all operating on a consultancy basis			1
' the weekend advanced the talks with the buyer as they saw we are not just the concept of a team , ' added @entity0			1
' they could see the people here are committed , together , that we 're an operational team , and that was really attractive			0
' crucially for the buyer , there will be no trace of the two previous regimes following the fallout between the @entity83 and @entity85 consortium who originally purchased the marque from @entity88 in june , only to throw in the towel in october when a row ensued			2
@entity91 talks with a team member during the first free practice at the @entity67 racetrack in @entity50 ' a number of people have approached me over the past few weeks that they were not happy with this or that , ' said @entity0			1
' one example is somebody paid for expensive paddock club tickets for one of the events and did n't receive them			0
obviously we 've other things on a much - bigger scale			0
' so many people have come forward and been unhappy about things that have happened in the past , that they 've been misled about things , and i 'll be investigating that			0
' but what happened with the previous owners does n't affect a new buyer at all			2
the buyer buys things clean of any issues			2
