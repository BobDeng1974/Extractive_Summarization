@entity0 pulled up with a calf strain after just two minutes of @entity3 ’s league game on saturday and will almost certainly miss the second leg of the @entity5 against @entity6 on wednesday			1
one year and two days , after one of his greatest moments at @entity3 when he ran half the length of the pitch to score the winner in the @entity13 final , @entity0 broke down with a muscle pull against @entity15			1
he will have further tests on the left calf muscle in the next 24 hours but the concern shown when he went down at the start of @entity3 ’s crucial league game suggested his chances of recovering inside three days are non-existent and that he could also face a race to be fit for the @entity5 semi-final on may 5 - 6			0
@entity0 went down injured after less than five minutes at the @entity24 on saturday evening the @entity26 forward was forced off and faces a race to be fit for @entity3 's @entity5 quarter - final @entity29 was the first player to go across to @entity0 as he sat waiting for treatment and the @entity32 ’s expression spoke volumes – he knew he would not be able to carry on and could now miss out on @entity3 ’s most important game of the season			1
@entity0 has not been injured since october of last year when a hip problem kept him out for three weeks			2
the team won all their games without him with a four - man midfield of @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 with @entity29 and @entity44 up front			0
that will be @entity48 ’s selection for the game on wednesday if @entity44 recovers from the knee knock that kept him out of saturday ’s meeting with @entity15			1
@entity0 ’s absence will be a massive blow for @entity48 however			0
he said in midweek : ‘ @entity0 was fantastic last season and has been very good this year			0
he scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax			0
’ @entity29 was the first @entity3 player to go over to @entity0 , and they eventually beat @entity15 3 - 1			2
