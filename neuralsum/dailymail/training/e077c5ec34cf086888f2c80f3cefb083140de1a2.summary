by @entity1 reporter published : 15:20 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 07:21 est , 3 march 2014 the case of @entity5 sgt. @entity4 , held by the @entity6 since 2009 , has arisen again as the @entity7 and other countries engage in diplomatic efforts to free him			1
but if he is released , will @entity7 's only prisoner of the @entity13 war be viewed as a hero or a deserter ? while tattered yellow ribbons still adorn utility poles in his native @entity19 , @entity20 , others are expressing conflicting thoughts about @entity4 's plight as the war winds down , with president @entity23 threatening to withdraw all @entity7 troops by year 's end unless the @entity13 government signs a crucial security agreement			1
they are convinced that on june 30 , 2009 , just a few months after he arrived in @entity13 , @entity4 willingly walked away from his unit , which was deployed in @entity29 in eastern @entity13 , adjacent to the border with @entity31			1
as the @entity32 continues to try and free @entity7 soldier @entity4 - who has been held captive by the @entity6 since 2009 - talk has turned to what will happen to him if and when he returns			1
@entity4 is seen here in a grab from a @entity6 video released in 2010 while they do want @entity4 home , they think he should have to answer allegations that he deserted his unit			1
@entity4 was last seen in a video the @entity6 released in december			1
at this year 's @entity45 , celebrities were photographed wearing @entity4 bracelets			2
in the past two years , billboards with @entity4 's face have popped up in major cities			2
one shows a smiling @entity4 , in an @entity5 uniform , with the message : ' he fought for us			2
... let 's fight for him ! ' a transcript of radio intercepts , publicly released through @entity57 , indicates that @entity4 , then 23 , was captured while sitting in a makeshift latrine			1
' we were attacking the post he was sitting , ' according to a radio intercept of a conversation among insurgents			0
' he had no gun with him			0
... they have all ( the ) @entity7 , @entity5 ) , helicopters , the planes are looking for him			2
can you guys make a video of him and announce it all over @entity13 that we have one of the @entity7 ? ' @entity74 magazine quoted emails @entity4 is said to have sent to his parents that suggest he was disillusioned with @entity7 's mission in @entity13 , had lost faith in the @entity81 's mission there and was considering desertion			1
@entity4 told his parents he was ' ashamed to even be @entity7 '			1
the case of @entity4 , held by the @entity6 since 2009 , has arisen again as the @entity7 and other countries engage in diplomatic efforts to end his capture @entity81 private @entity4 watches as one of his captors displays his identity tag to the camera at an unknown location in @entity13 , on july 19 , 2009 @entity4 , who mailed home boxes containing his uniform and books , also wrote : ' the future is too good to waste on lies			1
and life is way too short to care for the damnation of others , as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong			0
' the @entity104 could not independently authenticate the emails published by the magazine in 2012			0
@entity4 's family has not commented on the allegations of desertion , according to col. @entity110 , a spokesman for the @entity111			1
@entity110 is in regular contact with @entity4 's mother , @entity114 , and father , @entity115 , who has grown a long , thick beard and has worked to learn @entity117 , the language spoken by his son 's captors			2
a senior @entity32 official said that if @entity4 is released , it could be determined that he has more than paid for leaving his unit - if that 's what really happened - ' and there 's every indicator that he did '			1
still , it 's a conundrum for commanders under the @entity130 and the equal application of the law , according to the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the @entity4 case			1
@entity136 , who teaches military justice at @entity138 , said if there is evidence that @entity4 left his unit without permission , he could be charged with being absent without leave ( awol ) or desertion			1
desertion during a time of war can carry the death penalty			2
@entity114 and @entity147 , the parents of captured @entity81 sergeant @entity4 , address a rally held in their son 's honor in @entity152 , @entity20 june 22 , 2013 signs of support for @entity81 private @entity4 are displayed in the storefront window of @entity157 's @entity156 , in @entity19 , @entity20 but @entity158 never passed a declaration of war with respect to @entity13 , and neither president @entity161 nor president @entity23 has determined that @entity7 military operations in @entity13 make this a ' time of war ' for the purposes of the @entity130 , @entity136 said			1
were @entity4 to be charged with desertion , the maximum penalty he would face is five years in prison and a dishonorable discharge , if it 's proved that he deserted with the intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service			2
a case of @entity174 , ended by the @entity7 apprehending him , would not require proof that he intended to remain away permanently			2
the maximum punishment for that would be a dishonorable discharge and 18 months ' confinement , he said			2
' someone is going to have to make a decision , based on a preliminary investigation , as to whether this is a desertion or awol rather than simply having the bad luck to have fallen into the wrong hands , ' @entity136 said			0
' the command can say '' this fellow has been living in terrible conditions			0
we do n't approve of what he did but we 're not going to prosecute him , ' " he said			0
' or , the military could prosecute him as a way of signaling to others that ' look , you ca n't simply go over the hill ... it 's quite an interesting set of issues that will have to be addressed as a matter of both policy and law			0
' while the @entity7 government are attempt to free @entity4 from @entity6 captivity , it remains unclear how we will treated once he returns to the @entity7 desertion can be difficult to prove , said @entity209			1
maj. gen. @entity210 , a @entity211 attorney who served 28 years as a lawyer in the @entity5			0
' there has to be some evidence that he intended never to come back - that he intended to remain away from his unit permanently , ' @entity210 said			0
' i do n't know if they 'll charge him with anything			0
it will depend on the circumstances of his return and what he has to say			0
' @entity225 , chairman of the @entity226 , an educational nonprofit group founded in 1989 , said it 's futile to speculate			0
' he is an @entity7 soldier in enemy hands			0
bring him home , ' she said			0
rep. @entity232 , a member of the @entity233 and former @entity234 who served two tours in @entity236 and one in @entity13 , agreed			0
' it 's hard to imagine any circumstance where his captivity wo n't be viewed as time served , ' said @entity232 , @entity242 video footage taken from a @entity6 - affiliated website @entity245 , captured by the @entity6 in southeastern @entity13 in june 2009 ' the first order of business is securing his release and i do n't think it does an ounce of good to begin contemplating that far ahead when the focus is on getting him home			1
' @entity254 and her husband , ex-marines from outside @entity256 who launched a bring @entity4 home project in 2012 , do n't speculate about the details of his capture or efforts to release him			0
they just want him home			0
through donations , the small group has worked to raise awareness of @entity4 's captivity on more than 90 billboards in @entity7 cities			1
' every day , we meet people who do n't know about him , ' she said .			0
