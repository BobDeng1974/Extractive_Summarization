the @entity0 are exploring ways of outlawing initiation ceremonies despite them being a tradition for many clubs in @entity6			1
they are often used to welcome players joining a first team , be it from the academy or as a new signing , with singing a song in front of the rest of the squad a popular choice			0
but , as @entity19 revealed in his autobiography ' @entity21 ' , sometimes young players are forced into embarrassing acts for the enjoyment of first - team players			1
@entity19 was forced to take part in embarrassing acts during his time as a @entity29 apprentice @entity30 pundit @entity19 , pictured with @entity31 , wrote about his initiations in autobiography ' @entity33 ' discussing his time as a young player at @entity29 , @entity19 wrote : ' making love to @entity38 was one of the worst things about being an apprentice at @entity29			1
not the real @entity38 , obviously			2
he was sat in the dressing room p * * * * * * himself with laughter like the rest of the first - teamers			0
' no , this was a lifesize picture of our pin - up defender which would be stuck on to the treatment table by a senior player with a vicious sense of humour			0
as @entity56 music played , i , or whichever unlucky apprentice had been chosen , would have to dance around the table and pretend to get off with @entity59 's right - back			2
' i ca n't tell you how excruciating that is for a 16 - year - old in front of an audience of his heroes like @entity67 and @entity68			0
' @entity19 also revealed that anyone who refused to take part would be hit over the head with a football wrapped in a towel or given a dead arm by a line of second - year apprentices			1
apprentices at @entity78 were made to ' make love ' to a picture of @entity38 ( right ) @entity82 's @entity81 of the 1980s and 1990s were famed for their initiation ceremonies and pranks the former @entity29 defender , who spent 20 years at @entity78 , added that another punishment for young players was having the entire @entity29 kit rubbed on to them in dubbin with a wire brush , while being thrown into a moving tumble dryer was also popular			1
although initiations are often good natured , it may well be stories like these which have forced the @entity0 to take steps to stop ceremonies taking place			1
speaking ahead of monday night 's clash against @entity102 , @entity82 midfielder @entity100 said : ' we have initiation songs but that 's all getting ushered out by the @entity0 now			1
' i was on a course the other day and they are now trying to put a stop to it			2
' one player in the @entity112 on his first away trip was told that he had to sing a song and he said , ' no , i have n't got to do that '			0
former @entity117 assistant manager @entity116 is not a fan of initiation ceremonies ' that is the way that the game is going and the @entity0 now want to catch up with the times			1
' @entity19 's former team - mate , @entity116 , was never a fan of initiations as a player and believes there are better ways of making new players feel part of the squad			2
speaking to @entity132 magazine during his time as @entity117 assistant manager , @entity116 said : ' no , i do n't like that stuff			0
it happens now at @entity117 , but if i was a player at a new club and someone said , " you 've got to sing tonight , " i just f * * * * * * would n't do it			0
' people say it 's banter , but i do n't like that type of banter			0
i 'd help players by making sure they settled in properly , making sure my wife touched base with their family			0
