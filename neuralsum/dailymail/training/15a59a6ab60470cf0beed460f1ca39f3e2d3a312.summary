by @entity0 & @entity1 and @entity2 host nation @entity3 narrowly scraped through to the quarter - finals of the @entity6 in a nail - biting finish to this group of 16 tie against @entity10			1
the world 's number one - rated team played @entity15 rivals @entity10 at @entity16 in @entity17 probably expecting a relatively easy win			1
the @entity19 had a different view and took the game to the hosts who are bidding to be world champions for the sixth time			0
it could easily happen , given the momentum that is gathering behind this team , but to outsiders , based on objective evidence they look anything but champions			0
still when @entity35 stepped up and struck his penalty against the post , an entire nation finally drew breath and erupted in @entity39 down @entity40 flashes her @entity19 bra after @entity44 scores wild emotion : @entity3 's players celebrate their dramatic 3 - 2 penalty shootout against @entity10 in the last 16 conflicting emotions : @entity49 celebrates @entity3 's win in front of a backdrop of a crestfallen @entity10 embrace : @entity3 heroes @entity53 and @entity49 getting emotional in their celebrations dejection : @entity19 players slump to the floor after their heartbreaking defeat emotive : a @entity19 couple cry whilst @entity63 fans celebrate around them contrast : @entity10 players forlorn whilst @entity3 's stars celebrate crucial moment : @entity35 ( left ) watches on as his penalty strikes the post and eliminates @entity10 distraught : heartbroken @entity10 applaud their devastated fans inside the @entity16 after losing to @entity3 safe hands : @entity53 saved two penalties for @entity3 to help them reach the @entity6 quarter - finals hero : @entity53 ( centre ) was hoisted high by @entity3 's players in amongst the wild celebrations in @entity17 in it to win it : midfielder @entity83 ( centre ) rallies the @entity3 squad before the shootout against @entity10 hopes of a nation : @entity3 fans packed the @entity16 as the five - time @entity6 winners took on @entity10 @entity3 @entity49 - scored - top left @entity91 - missed - wide of left post @entity93 - scored - top right hulk - missed - keeper saved to his left @entity96 - scored - bottom left @entity10 panilla - missed - keeper saved down the middle sanchez - missed - keeper saved to his right @entity100 - scored - top right @entity101 - scored - down the middle @entity35 - missed - hit right post @entity3 won 3 - 2 on penalties the tension had been excruciating for players and fans up until that point in an almost - unbearable penalty shoot - out			1
@entity10 , who had until the penalties performed heroically , fell apart , scoring just two of their five with @entity113 reject @entity53 saving two			1
@entity114 pulling one penalty lamely wide and @entity116 allowing his to be saved @entity117			1
to a nation and to @entity120 ’s relief , @entity49 and @entity93 proved true and then at the last it fell to @entity96			2
the burden seemed too much as he jinxed and hesitated in his run up - but then pulled the ball calmly to the right of @entity117 to score what would turn out to be the winning penalty			0
so amidst the celebrations , the performance could be forgotten			0
timid and lacking in fluency , @entity3 limped over the line			2
perhaps they will grow into a champion mentality with each hurdle they clear			0
yesterday they created more chances than @entity10 but for long periods were out - thought tactically by a delightfully composed @entity19 side , directed by @entity140			1
in fact , they were lucky even to get to penalties			0
in the last minute of extra time , @entity144 exchanged passes with @entity44 and fairly thumped the ball of the cross bar , as @entity63 looked on aghast and bewildered			1
that overpowering sense of expectation for a sixth world title mixed with a fevered outbreak of nationalism created an extraordinary entrance for the @entity3 team with the stadium fairly shook as the din engulfed it throughout the spectacle			2
the @entity159 increased the volume still further : even the mascots had their arms around each other and were bellowing it out			0
on this occasion the players managed to repress their tears that have characterised previous games and led to fears that the occasion was overwhelming them			0
on a darker note , parts of the @entity19 national anthem were obscured by a din of whistles : it ’s not all carnival and sunshine in @entity3			2
deadlock broken : @entity49 ( centre ) scored the opening goal for @entity3 in their last 16 clash against @entity10 tears of joy : @entity49 is tearful after his opening goal for @entity3 in their last 16 clash against @entity10 team spirit : @entity3 's @entity6 squad engage in a bundle in celebration of @entity49 's goal in @entity17 party pooper : @entity44 equalised for @entity10 in the first - half with a low shot into the @entity63 goal agonising : @entity3 goalkeeper @entity53 can only look on as @entity44 's shot beats him at the @entity16 main man : @entity44 's goal was his second in the tournament in an impressive display by the forward huddle : @entity10 's @entity6 squad celebrate @entity44 's goal against the tournament hosts @entity3 : @entity53 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity49 , @entity93 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity116 , @entity211 , @entity96 , @entity212			1

@entity10 : @entity117 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity208 , @entity44 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity35 , @entity100 , @entity101			1

referee : @entity242 ( @entity243 ) before the match , the most - heated discussions had surrounded the anticipated performance of @entity242 , the @entity19 fearing that referees here are under pressure to favour @entity3			1
the @entity63 in turn countered that the @entity19 were themselves putting @entity242 under pressure not to award them tight decisions			0
and the @entity253 was soon put to the test , with @entity96 playing in @entity116 on 13 minutes			2
the @entity63 forward , in the penalty area , raced towards goal but @entity225 nicked the ball from between his legs			2
@entity260 went @entity116 and the @entity261 roared in anctipation but @entity242 , correctly , waved away the appeals to howls of anguish			2
they need not have protested quite so fervently			0
within five minutes they were ahead from a bog - standard set piece			0
@entity96 drilled in a corner , @entity208 angled the flick on to the far post and though @entity49 was there to direct it home , it was actually the out - stretched leg of @entity274 who diverted it into the net			1
@entity49 was n’t waiting for a dubious goals ’ panel to deliberate , racing away accepting the adoration of the crowd and team - mates			1
at that stage , it looked to be a long afternoon for the @entity19			0
talking point : @entity3 had a goal disallowed by referee @entity242 for @entity116 's ( left ) handball fuming : @entity10 players protested against @entity116 's goal to @entity242 ( top right ) who disallowed the strike hulk the sulk : the @entity3 forward was in disbelief at the decision of his disallowed second - half goal fantastic three : @entity3 fans soak up the atmosphere by dressing up as fictional characters @entity300 and @entity116 yet @entity3 have been a strange mixture at this @entity6 ; at times they play with real verve and incision ; but they can also look an anxious group of young men , unsure whether they can bear the weight of expectation			1
equally , @entity10 have been one the joys of the tournament , playing some of the best football			1
and with @entity3 reverting to their tentative demeanour and @entity10 refusing to be cowed , a small earthquake occurred in @entity17 : @entity10 scored			1
the manner of the goal amply demonstrated @entity3 ’s nerves			1
a @entity93 throw - in was sloppily touched back to him by @entity116 ; @entity227 nipped in and played it first time to @entity44			1
the @entity322 target simply took one touch to control and a second to score with a fine finish from inside the box			0
in small pockets of the stadium , small red corners erupted and embraced each other			0
yet everywhere else there was a stunned sense of disbelief			0
@entity212 should have done better from close range when @entity225 did enough to encourage him to blaze a shot over rather than direct it goal - wards from close range ; @entity207 had an excellent strike well saved by @entity117 ; and @entity96 clearly had the measure of @entity340 and @entity228 , frequently out - running them			1
but @entity10 also threatened with @entity44 playing in @entity100 on half time , forcing @entity53 to make a smart save			1
all smiles : @entity344 team - mates @entity96 , @entity44 and @entity207 ( left - right ) joke before the game beautiful scenes : @entity10 and @entity3 fans illuminated the @entity349 with their vibrant team colours strapped up : @entity228 receives treatment for a muscle injury during half - time of extra-time on saturday @entity3 attempted to regroup			1
@entity209 , staring is first match at the tournament and replacing @entity357 ’s @entity83 , sized up a shot on 48 minutes			2
it flew just wide and the @entity360 midfield winced , yet it steadied the crowd somewhat			0
@entity3 , it seemed , would surely put this right			2
still greater excitement ensued on 51 minutes , when @entity116 raced on to a long ball , took it down and touched it past @entity117			2
@entity17 rejoiced but they had reckoned without the prying eyes of assistant ref @entity366 , who judged that @entity116 had controlled the ball with both his shoulder and arm			2
heart - stopping moment : @entity3 's poster boy @entity96 ( centre ) receives treatment as he struggles with fatigue it was a tight decision , probably correct but predictably it had @entity376 up off the bench and in a rage for much of the next five minutes			1
the arrival of @entity221 brought an expression of fresh hope from the crowd that would bewilder @entity385 audiences			0
and @entity10 it was who came closest to scoring on 65 minutes			1
@entity225 played a great one - two with @entity226 and then pulled the ball back for @entity100			0
he struck with power from close range and if a nation could collectively gasp in premature horror , this was that moment			0
only a superb reflex save from @entity53 prevented the national calamity			0
@entity101 and @entity226 in midfield were establishing a grip on the game and @entity44 was a lurking threat			0
the @entity63 continued to chant and to sing but it was the football equivalent of whistling in the dark , for their team lacked the authority you might have expected			0
as much was confirmed when @entity116 delivered a perfect cross into the path of @entity221 , who , three yards out from goal and with just @entity117 to beat , failed to make any contact with the ball .			1

@entity3 beat @entity10 3 - 2 to reach the @entity6 quarter - finals
enthralling all - @entity15 affair went into extra-time after ending 1 - 1
@entity10 's @entity35 hit the post with his spot - kick to send @entity3 through
@entity49 opened the scoring for tournament hosts @entity3 in the first - half
@entity44 equalised for @entity10 with a low shot in the first - half
@entity3 forward @entity116 had a disallowed second - half goal for handball
@entity429 hit the bar late in extra-time for @entity10
