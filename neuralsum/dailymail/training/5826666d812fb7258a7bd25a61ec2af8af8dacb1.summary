by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 28 may 2013 mothers who undergo weight - loss surgery are less likely to have obese children because it affects the baby 's genes in the womb , according to new research			1
it has been known for some time that obese mothers tend to have overweight children , but until now it was thought to be solely linked to lifestyle factors such as poor diet and lack of exercise			1
but the new study discovered that children born to mothers who underwent weight - loss surgery possessed genes that worked differently to their older siblings who were born before the mother underwent the procedure			1
pregnant women who are obese expose their babies to higher levels of sugar and fat which in turn affects their genes			1
it is thought that genes play an important role in deciding whether a person goes on to be overweight experts discovered that children born after their mother lost a large amount of weight were slimmer than their siblings			1
they also had fewer risk factors for diabetes or heart disease later in life			2
clearly diet and exercise play a huge role in how large a child grows up to be , but the findings suggest that children born after their mother 's surgery might have an advantage			1
' the impact on the genes , you will see the impact for the rest of your life , ' said dr. @entity60 of @entity61 in @entity62 , who led the research			2
experts said that it is n't that a mother passes on different genes , but how those genes operate in her child 's body			2
scientists found that children born before a mother 's weight - loss surgery were more likely to be overweight researchers took blood samples from children born to 20 women before and after complex surgery that shrank their stomachs and rerouted digestion , so they absorbed less fat and calories			1
on average , they lost about 100 pounds			0
after comparing chemical tags in more than 5,600 genes between the younger and older siblings , they found significant differences in the activity of certain genes clustered in pathways known to affect blood sugar metabolism and heart disease risk			1
dr. @entity93 of @entity95 's @entity94 , who co-authored the study , said that foetuses are ' marinated , and they 're differently marinated ' depending on a mother 's weight and health			1
he explained that factors inside the womb seem to affect the ' dimmer switches ' that develop on a foetus ' genes - chemical changes that make genes speed up or slow down or switch on and off			1
overweight mothers have higher levels of sugar and fat in the bloodstream , which travels to the womb and the baby inside			1
this may do more than overstimulate fetal growth			0
scientists know that certain molecules regulate gene activity , attaching like chemical tags			0
dr. @entity120 of @entity121 , who was not involved in the @entity123 research but studies uterine effects on later health , said it made biological sense that the earliest nutritional environment could affect a developing metabolism , although she cautions that healthier family habits after a mother 's surgery may play a role , too			2
the research has implications far beyond the relatively few women who take the drastic step of gastric bypass surgery before having a baby			2
dr @entity120 added that obesity is ' not just impacting your life , it 's impacting your child			0
' all mothers put on weight during pregnancy			0
over a third of any extra weight will come from the baby , the placenta and the amniotic fluid			0
on average , the baby , placenta and amniotic fluid will total 4.8kg ( 10lb 9oz )			0
the rest of the weight can be accounted for by the changes that happen in the mother 's body while pregnant			0
the womb grows dramatically and weighs an extra 0.9kg ( 2lb ) , blood volume increases and weighs an extra 1.2kg ( 2.6lb ) , extra fluid in the body weighs about 1.2kg ( 2.6lb ) , breasts weigh an extra 0.4kg ( 0.9lb ) and extra fat , about 4kg ( 8.8lb ) , will be stored to give energy for breastfeeding			2
by the end of pregnancy , a woman may weigh about 12.5kg ( 27.6lb ) more than she did before you became pregnant			0
there are no official guidelines for weight gain in pregnancy in the @entity176 , although it is advised that women who are normal weight at the start of pregnancy should gain 25lb ( 11.3kg ) to 35lb ( 15.8kg ) those who already are obese should gain no more than 11lb ( 4.9kg ) to 20lb ( 9.1kg )			0
overweight mothers - to - be fall in the middle			0

@entity123 study found that the children of women who had a gastric band were slimmer than their older siblings born before the procedure
found genetic differences between children born pre and *post-operation* because babies were ' marinated ' in different levels of blood and fat
study shows that it is genes , and not just lifestyle factors such as poor diet and lack of exercise , that are to blame for childhood obesity
