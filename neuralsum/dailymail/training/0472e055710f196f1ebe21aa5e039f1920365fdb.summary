a near - miss between two @entity2 planes would have been even closer had the pilots waited for a confused @entity5 air - traffic controller to respond to the collision alarm , a safety report has found			1
the two @entity8 aircraft came too close in october 2012 while flying near the shared civil - military airport at @entity10			1
due to a transponder coding mistake , the @entity5 approach controller was unable to properly track the 717 twin - engine on the radar			2
the two @entity8 aircraft came too close in october 2012 while flying near the shared civil - military airport at @entity10 after visually spotting the approaching 737 , the 717 pilots ' proactively limited their aircraft 's descent ' to @entity10 airport and informed the air - controller that meant when a predicted collision alarm went off , the @entity5 controller had ' a significant level of confusion ' as to the most reliable information - resulting in a 15 second delay			1
fortunately the pilots of the 717 had already identified the potential threat from their own computer systems			1
after visually spotting the approaching 737 , the 717 pilots ' proactively limited their aircraft 's descent ' to @entity10 airport and informed the air - controller - who advised them to stay at 10,000ft			1
unable to pull out of its climb from @entity10 airport with such limited notice , the 737 maintained its course for @entity38			2
just 21 seconds after the 717 altered its descent the 737 passed 900ft ' directly ' underneath , less than the 1000ft minimum separation requirement			0
an @entity43 report on thursday found that ' overall there was minimal risk of collision ' due to the collision alarms alerting both sets of pilots			0
however , the gap would have been smaller if not for the proactive response from the pilots			0
the @entity53 welcomed the report 's recommendations regarding training systems and safety issues			0
it advised in a statement that it had already started implementing them			0
at the time , the @entity5 controller was temporarily suspended from duty pending investigations			2
an update has been sought from @entity65 .			0

two @entity8 aircrafts came too close in october 2012 while flying near the shared civil - military airport at @entity10
it could *'ve* been too late if pilots waited for a confused @entity5 air - traffic controller to respond
luckily the @entity2 pilots were able to identify the potential threat from their own computer systems
