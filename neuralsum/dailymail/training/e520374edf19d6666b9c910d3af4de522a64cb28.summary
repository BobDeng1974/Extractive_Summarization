the @entity1 's footman who enjoyed world - wide fame on the day of the birth @entity5 has returned to the @entity7 slum he grew up in			1
falling foul of new immigration laws , @entity8 , a 25 - year - old hospitality management graduate , has returned to his family in eastern @entity12 , where relatives beaming with pride have welcomed him home			1
the young graduate accompanied the @entity17 's press secretary @entity16 in placing the announcement of @entity5 's birth on an easel outside @entity21 last week			1
proud : @entity8 ( r ) , who enjoyed world - wide fame on the day of the birth of @entity5 , son of the @entity25 and @entity26 , poses with his brother @entity27 ( second from right ) , father @entity28 ( centre ) and mother @entity30 ( @entity31 ) outside their home in @entity7 , @entity12 today mr @entity8 , right , pictured today back in his home in @entity7 , eastern @entity12 , was welcomed home by his family , including his brother , left but just days later , his visa expired ; he was unable to renegotiate his right to work in the country ; and he quit his coveted post at the @entity40			1
he has now arrived home - a world that perhaps could n't be more different from the life he had lived last week			0
ironically it appears that mr @entity8 , whose chronically poor family scrimped and saved every penny they had in order to educate him , has fallen foul of strict new immigration laws because of his notoriously meagre palace salary of around £ 14,000 a year			1
mr @entity8 , who first came to @entity52 to study for a degree in hospitality , was one of a number of migrants living legally in @entity52 on a student visa who were allowed to stay on for two years at the end of their course and work			1
but under the new points - based system , those applying to extend their visa after it expires must prove they are not taking a job which could be done by a native worker			2
this means they need specialist skills which are in shortage among @entity52 , or for them to prove that they meet a minimum salary threshold , currently set at around £ 20,000 a year - neither of which applied to his palace footman ’s post			1
@entity80 , a relative of @entity8 , shows a graduation photo of him outside the family home in a poor slum area of @entity7 his life back in @entity7 could n't be further from his previous world working for the @entity1 , which came to an abrupt end last week			1
on the ground floor of his family home , a shoe factory can be seen being run from a small room the main entrance of mr @entity8 's family home , centre , in a poor district of the @entity96 city of @entity7 a friend of mr @entity8 , who flew home last weekend shortly before his visa was due to run out , said : ‘ it ’s a crying shame , really			1
you could n’t meet anyone more dutiful , hard - working and determined than @entity8			2
‘ the new regulations were brought in for a very good reason , we all understand that			2
it ’s just rather ironic that someone like @entity8 , who follows every regulation to the letter , is prevented from working here , compared to the many thousands who slip through the system			2
’ mr @entity8 found fame on monday last week when he was photographed with the @entity17 ’s press secretary displaying the official announcement of the birth of the @entity25 and @entity26 ’s new son on an easel in the palace forecourt			1
resplendent in his black and red livery , it was complete chance that he was chosen for the job			0
in fact it would have fallen to the footman on duty at that moment , at the palace ’s privy purse entrance			0
‘ the rota changes every three hours and it was a complete fluke			0
but he was a very popular member of staff and everyone was chuffed to bits for him , ’ one official told the @entity132			0
the royal footman became a well - known face globally when he accompanied the @entity17 's press secretary @entity16 to place the royal notice proclaiming the birth of a baby boy to prince @entity142 and @entity143 , @entity26 last week moment of fame : days after the arrival of the royal baby , mr @entity8 had returned to his family in @entity7 , his visa having expired his welder father @entity150 and mother , @entity30 , who are among nine members of the extended family sharing a shabby two - room home in one of @entity7 ’s most impoverished slums , were unaware of the honour and only learnt of his starring role after his picture was reproduced in a local newspaper			1
mr @entity28 , who has three sons , of which @entity8 is the eldest , used to regularly go without food in order pay for his son to be educated			2
he was eventually taken in by the charitable @entity166 before being sponsored to go to the @entity167 in the city			0
the orphanage also raised £ 10,000 for him to complete his degree at the @entity172 ’s @entity171 , from where he graduated in june 2011			0
he secured his footman ’s post in february the following year , a job which involved everything from greeting guests , serving at banquets or receptions and tending to the @entity17 personally			0
the @entity25 and @entity26 , pictured shortly after the arrival of their first child , @entity5 , outside the @entity184 last week prince @entity142 carried his son the prince of @entity186 into a car outside @entity189 exclusive @entity188 in @entity190 , last tuesday he was also given a room in staff quarters at the @entity193 , adjacent to the palace			0
although he was forced to sign strict staff confidentiality agreements , proud mr @entity8 posted a photograph of himself outside @entity21 on one social network site , as well as shots of royal residences such as @entity200 where he would have been required to work when the @entity17 was on holiday			1
according to sources , he loved his job so much he explored the possibility of extending his visa with the palace personnel department , but discovered that due to his low salary and coveted position he was extremely unlikely to be successful			1
as a result he did chose not reapply to the @entity210 and flew back to @entity12 four days ago			2
a source said : ‘ it is a real shame as he was a very good member of staff about whom people only have very positive things to say			0
but it just goes to show that the rules are the rules , no matter who you work for			0
' he was here on a two - year visa and always knew it was going to expire			0
as a result he flew home at the weekend in good spirits and very rightly proud of what he had achieved			0
’ a @entity21 spokesman declined to comment last night , saying it was policy never to discuss staff members .			0

@entity8 , 25 , had to leave the country just days after announcing the royal baby 's birth
the hospitality graduate was unable to renegotiate his visa after new immigration rules were brought in
due to his meagre @entity1 salary of £ 14,000 , he fell below a new threshold
he was pictured back in @entity7 today with his proud family
