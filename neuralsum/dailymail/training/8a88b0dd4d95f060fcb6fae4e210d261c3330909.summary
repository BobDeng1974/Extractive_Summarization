by @entity0 published : 18:58 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 07:51 est , 3 january 2014 listeners to @entity3 's flagship today programme awoke to the news on november 5 last year that immigrants who had come to @entity7 since 2000 had made a ' substantial ' contribution to the country 's public finances			1
the findings of the study by @entity13 were also given huge coverage across the @entity3 's tv bulletins and its website			1
@entity17 said the authors , professor @entity19 and dr @entity20 , had found that , rather than being a ' drain ' on the @entity24 , the contribution of immigrants had been ' remarkably strong '			2
@entity25 ( right ) , pictured with @entity26 ( left ) , uncritically trotted out the findings of a study on immigration to suggest the public had nothing to fear from the prospect of a significant new influx those from the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) – the @entity35 plus @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 – were said to have made ' a particularly positive contribution in the decade up to 2011 , contributing 34 per cent more in taxes than they received in benefits '			1
immigrants from outside the area , meanwhile , were reported as having contributed 2 per cent more in taxes than they received in the same period			0
ever since the @entity13 report 's publication , it has been treated as an article of faith by @entity3 presenters			1
not surprisingly , on wednesday , as restrictions on @entity54 and @entity55 working in the @entity7 were lifted , today presenter @entity25 uncritically trotted out its findings to suggest the public had nothing to fear from the prospect of a significant new influx			2
yet , as the @entity62 reported yesterday significant questions are now being asked about the accuracy of the academics ' report , which other experts say contains ' schoolboy errors '			1
@entity69 , @entity70 at @entity13 , and statistician @entity71 of the right - leaning think - tank @entity68 suggested yesterday it was a ' fatally flawed ' piece of work			1
the failings they identify are complex , and relate to the methodology used to work out the impact migrants are having on housing and the transport network			0
but the main problem , say professor @entity69 and mr @entity71 , is that the researchers started with the assumption that immigration was positive for @entity7			0
they then made a series of other assumptions to prove that this belief – almost as an article of faith for many at the @entity3 over the years – was correct			1
@entity92 , the @entity3 's former @entity93 , has admitted that the @entity95 's ' deep liberal bias ' prevented it from reporting immigration properly as professor @entity69 observed : ' if any honest statistician had made the same painstaking but assumption - based calculations , the last word he / she would have used to describe the estimates is “ precise ” – unless exhaustion had affected judgment			1
' most of the underlying crude assumptions that the all - embracing approach has been obliged to make have not been subject to sensitivity tests that might have been made if the study had not been so obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made			2
' mr @entity71 , meanwhile , says the authors have deliberately overstated the benefits of @entity34 immigration – a particularly crucial finding , given the current debate over benefit tourism and the lifting of restrictions on 29million citizens of @entity54 and @entity55			0
the @entity13 report found that , over an 11 - year period , @entity34 migrants had made a net contribution to the economy of £ 22billion			1
but mr @entity71 said this conclusion was ' vulnerable ' to even a small change in the assumptions used by the report 's authors			2
dr @entity20 graduated from @entity129 , @entity130 , and is currently assistant professor at the @entity132 of the @entity133			0
the central bus station in @entity135 , @entity55 where passengers will start travelling to @entity7 and @entity138 destinations in 2003 , ahead of @entity140 and seven other @entity142 countries joining the @entity35 , professor @entity19 was one of the authors of the notoriously inept @entity145 study predicting that only between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants a year would come to the @entity7			2
in the end , more than one million arrived – the largest single wave of immigration to this country since 1066			0
indeed , the research was so disastrous that , ahead of @entity54 and @entity55 citizens getting full rights to work this week , the current government refused to repeat the exercise			0
is it unfair to suggest that , having so spectacularly underestimated the number of @entity138 who would arrive in the @entity7 post- 2004 , professor @entity19 might feel inclined to ' spin ' their positive impact ? certainly , if the @entity3 mentioned his central role in the flawed 2003 study , i must have missed it in the blanket coverage afforded to the more recent report in november			1
but then why would @entity3 chiefs be critical of a study which confirmed their own long - held views ? there are many other reasons to question the @entity13 report			1
for instance , it made no attempt to distinguish between the types of contribution made by migrants from the @entity138 countries which joined the @entity35 in 2004 , and ' old ' member states such as @entity181 and @entity182			0
highly skilled @entity182 engineers and @entity181 fashion designers and bankers were therefore lumped together with lower - paid migrants from @entity140 and elsewhere			0
unsurprisingly , this produced a positive – if flawed – conclusion			0
most egregiously , the @entity13 report appeared deliberately to downplay the conclusion that between 1995 and 2011 immigrants from outside the @entity34 claimed £ 100billion more in benefits than they paid in taxes			1
( this is , mostly , because they tended to have more children than native @entity7			0
) in any case , focusing on the economic contribution made to the @entity7 exchequer by migrants ignores other vital issues			0
people prepare to board a bus to @entity202 via @entity182 and franceat the central bus station in @entity135 for example , much of the public 's concern about mass immigration is based on how @entity7 's infrastructure and social fabric can cope with such a rapidly expanding population			0
meanwhile , @entity92 , the @entity3 's former @entity93 , has admitted that the @entity95 's ' deep liberal bias ' prevented it from reporting immigration properly or taking lobby groups critical of mass immigration seriously			1
it is true that it occasionally invites the respected former diplomat sir @entity217 , chairman of @entity218 , to give a brief alternative view , during which he will be challenged ferociously by the same presenters who treat the pro-immigration lobby with kid gloves			0
as dr @entity224 , director of @entity68 , said yesterday : ' it is regrettable that even academics from an august institution like @entity13 can only see what they want to see			2
' yet again the @entity3 has failed in its duty to provide the public with impartial information			2
' it has the resources to double - check conclusions based on statistical studies but instead seized on the conclusions to bolster its pre-existing prejudices			0
' but , having given the @entity13 's study such prominent coverage at the time , you 'd think @entity3 's today programme would find time to report the serious problems highlighted by @entity68 and professor @entity69 yesterday			1
experience of @entity3 bias teaches us , however , that we should not hold our breath .			2

findings of a @entity13 study given huge coverage across @entity3
yet , questions are now being asked about the accuracy of report
