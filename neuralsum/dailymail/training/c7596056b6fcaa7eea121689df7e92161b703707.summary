by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 18:51 est , 31 july 2013 iron - rich foods such as steak , spinach , liver and nuts could cut the risk of dementia in later life , say researchers			1
a study has found that people with anaemia – where levels of red blood cells are lower than normal – were more likely to develop conditions such as @entity16 ’s			1
the most common cause of anaemia , besides heavy blood loss , is iron deficiency , suggesting that a dietary change could help protect against dementia			1
@entity22 : steak is a source of iron - rich food , which may help protect against dementia researchers made the connection between dementia and anaemia after studying more than 2,500 adults aged between 70 and 79			1
‘ anaemia is common in the elderly and occurs in up to 23 per cent of adults aged 65 and older , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity32 , of the @entity33			2
‘ the condition has also been linked in studies to an increased risk of early death			2
’ of those who took part in the study , 393 had anaemia at the start , while all those involved were given memory and brain power tests			2
at the end of the study , 445 – or about 18 per cent – had developed dementia			2
the research found those who had anaemia at the start of the study had a nearly 41 per cent higher risk of developing dementia than those who were not anaemic			1
spinach : anaemia may play a role in dementia by reducing oxygen supplies to the brain , which can damage neurons			0
foods like spinach could combat that the link remained after considering other factors , such as age , race , sex and education , says a report in the medical journal @entity74			1
of the 393 with anaemia , 89 , or 23 per cent , developed dementia , compared to 366 of the 2,159 who did not have anaemia , or 17 per cent			0
dr @entity32 said anaemia may play a role in dementia by reducing oxygen supplies to the brain , which can damage neurons and have been shown to reduce memory and thinking abilities			0
dr @entity87 of the @entity88 said : ‘ maybe our parents were right to tell us that we should eat more spinach			0
‘ this interesting research suggests that lower iron levels may have a link with cognitive health later on in life			1
‘ however , more research is needed and we should n’t make the jump to claim that anaemia causes dementia			0
‘ the best way to reduce your risk of dementia is to lead a healthy lifestyle			0
enjoy a balanced @entity107 diet rich in fruit and vegetables , oily fish and even the occasional glass of red wine , take regular exercise and do n’t smoke			1
’ dr @entity114 of @entity115 , said : ‘ this large study adds to previous observations of a link between anaemia and a higher dementia risk , but it hard to say with any certainty that anaemia is a causal factor in the condition			0
’ ‘ while age is the biggest risk factor for dementia , current research suggests that lifestyle choices may have an influence on our dementia risk			0

iron - rich foods can delay onset of *degenerative* *disease* , say researchers
anaemic peope are more likely to develop conditions like @entity16 *'s*
