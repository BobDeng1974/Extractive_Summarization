a rare red and grey bird whose plumage is split into two halves has been found to be half female and half male that does not sing			1
the unusual northern cardinal was first spotted in @entity9 , @entity10 in 2008 and has excited ornithologists for years			1
now scientists who have been studying the bird say it is an example of a a condition known as bilateral gynandromorphism			1
the split - sex northern cardinal has bright red male plumage on its left and drab female feathers on its right this means that it is a split - sex bird , with the bright red colour of male northern cardinal on its left side and the brownish grey of the female on its right			1
this occurs when the sex chromosomes in its cells are split unevenly during very early development after the egg is fertilised			0
however , despite its striking plumage , the split - sex bird has a rather lonely life , according to the researchers from @entity38 who have been following the birds movements			1
they said that it never managed to find a mate nor was it ever heard to sing or call			2
however , it was also not persecuted by other cardinals and instead seemed to be largely ignored			0
male northern cardinals usually have bright red plumage ( left ) while females are a drab grey or brown ( right ) professor @entity50 , a behavioural ecologist who led the study , said : ' the bird exhibited the typical bright red color of a male cardinal on the left half of its body , and the dull brownish - gray appearance of a female cardinal on the right half			1
' we observed the bird more than 40 days , mostly in the vicinity of bird feeders			0
' it was never paired with another cardinal , was never heard vocalizing , and was not subjected to any unusual agonistic behaviors from other cardinals			0
' these observations are among the most extensive of any bilateral gynandromorph bird in the wild			2
' male northern cardinals ( above ) usually mark out their territory with whistled songs but the split - sex bird was not found to make any vocalisations during the period that the scientists were studying the animal @entity79 most commonly exist among insects such as butterflies but are also known to occur in birds and crustaceans			1
however , few scientists get to study them in detail in the wild			2
northern @entity88 so called due to the bright red plumage that the males develop , which are said to resemble the scarlet vestments worn warn by @entity88			1
they tend to be found in woodlands and gardens in the eastern @entity94 and @entity95			0
measuring up to 8.3 inches , it mainly feeds on insects and fruits			0
the male birds usually mark out their territory by singing and will court females by feeding them seeds from their beak			2
their song tends to be a loud clear whistle that are repeated several times while cardinal pairs also use a chipping noise to locate each other			0
it is not clear why the split - sex northern cardinal did not make any vocalisations but it may be partly why it tended to be shunned by other birds			2
the bird is thought to have both testes and ovaries			0
professor @entity50 added that the bird did not appear to be suffering any ill affects as a result of its condition			0
he sad : ' other than it 's unusual appearance , the fact that it was never paired with another bird , and it did n't vocalize , it appeared relatively " normal " , if that can be said about this bird			0
' both male and female cardinals vocalize and sing , so it 's not clear why this bird did not sing			1
the degree of symmetry in our bird was striking , even through the crest on the top of the bird 's head			0
' it is the second time a gynandromorph cardinal has been sighted , with one in 1969 reported to have the opposite plumage with the male 's bright red colouring on the right and the drabber female feathers on the left .			1

the half red and half grey bird suffers from bilateral gynandromorphism
male northern cardinals have red plumage while females are grey - brown
researchers at @entity38 say the bird never found a mate
the scientists also claim the bird never sang or called during their study
it was first spotted on @entity9 , @entity10 in 2008 and *regularly* *returned*
