' even though today ’s unmanned systems are ‘ dumb ’ in comparison to a human counterpart , strides are being made quickly to incorporate more automation at a faster pace than we ’ve seen before , ' said @entity51 , director of the cognitive science program at the @entity33			0
but , research from @entity54 has found robots are incpable of having feelings and developing rational thinking			0
using mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness , they claim emotional machines will never exist			2
this is because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling , an expert claimed			0
