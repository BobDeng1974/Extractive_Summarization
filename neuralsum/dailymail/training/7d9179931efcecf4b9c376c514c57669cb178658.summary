the world ’s longest prehistoric animal dung is set to go up for auction next week			1
the fossilised excrement dates back to the @entity5 and @entity4 , which makes it anywhere from 5.3 to 33.9 million years old			1
found in @entity9 , @entity8 the giant dung is expected to reach £ 4,700 to £ 5,800 ( $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 ) when it goes under the hammer on 22 july the longest ancient animal dung on @entity13 ( shown ) is going up for auction in @entity15			1
it measures 40 inches ( one metre ) in length and has a pale brown - yellow colour			1
@entity19 expects it to reach up to £ 5,800 ( $ 10,000 ) when it goes under the hammer on 22 july the lack of vast amounts of fossilised dinosaur feces has baffled scientists for years			1
however , @entity26 researchers believe the answer lies in the diet of cockroaches , which might have dined on dinosaur waste millions of years ago			2
using cutting - edge imaging methods , the scientists discovered particles of wood inside an ancient cockroach ’s gut , which they think came from dinosaur feces			0
researchers from the @entity37 in @entity38 said that dinosaurs certainly must have produced a lot of feces , and yet fossils of the waste are not very widely discovered			0
‘ although appearing trivial , cockroaches , one of the dominant insect orders during the @entity48 , were never examined as representing top candidates for partial processors of dinosaur dung , ’ they wrote in their study			0
the dung is what is known as coprolite , fossilised feces that can provide information about an animal ’s diet rather than just its appearance			1
it is described by @entity63 auctioneers @entity61 as an ‘ eye - watering 40 inches [ one metre ] in length ’			1
however , research has failed to reveal what animal the excrement originated from			0
‘ this truly spectacular specimen is possibly the longest example of coprolite - fossilised dinosaur feces - ever to be offered at auction , ’ said @entity68 , spokesman for the auctioneer			1
' it boasts a wonderfully even , pale brown - yellow colouring and terrifically detailed texture to the heavily botryoidal [ globular ] surface across the whole of its immense length			0
‘ the passer of this remarkable object is unknown , but it is nonetheless a highly evocative specimen of unprecedented size			0
' he continued that the specimen was ' presented in four sections , each with a heavy black marble custom base , an eye - watering 40 inches [ one metre ] in length overall			2
’ despite being many millions of years old the excrement is not thought to have belonged to a dinosaur though , as these animals existed only up until 66 million years ago			2
also for sale are a selection of five stool - shaped specimens thought to have come from a @entity98 turtle , 23.03 to 5.332 million years ago , estimated to sell for £ 2,300 to £ 3,500 ( $ 4,000 to 6,000 )			2
' although it is often impossible to tell which species produced these fascinating petrified feces , it is supposed that the fine examples found in a small area of @entity8 are from a @entity98 turtle , ' said mr @entity61			0
' it is also suggested that rather than being coprolites , they are in fact cololites , internal casts of the intestine			0

pictured is the collection of the cololites ( fossilised intestinal cast ) thought to be from the turtle 's intestine			0

longest prehistoric animal dung on @entity13 up for auction in @entity15
it measures 40 inches in length and is 5.3 to 33.9 million years old
@entity19 expects it to reach $ 10,000 when under the hammer
fossilised feces of this sort if is known as coprolite and can reveal diet info
however researchers are *n't* sure what dinosaur it originated from
