by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 04:20 est , 4 october 2012 a woman left paralysed from head to toe after a bout of tonsillitis has made a miraculous recovery			1
@entity7 , 25 , spent four months fighting for her life after the throat infection triggered the killer nerve disorder @entity12 syndrome			1
the condition attacks the lining of the nerves , leaving patients unable to move , swallow or breathe unassisted			1
@entity7 spent four months battling the deadly nerve disorder @entity12 triggered by tonsillitis			1
she has since made a full recovery miss @entity7 , a council worker from @entity19 , survived despite her lungs collapsing twice and suffering pneumonia five times			1
she has since gone on to stun medics by learning to walk and talk again			2
she said : ' doctors told my family they did n’t think i was going to make it as i had a severe form of the disorder			2
' i was so scared about what was happening that they had to heavily sedate me			2
' my recovery has been a very slow process			2
when i took my first steps , i sobbed			2
' miss @entity7 was enjoying a weekend away in @entity36 with boyfriend @entity37 , 34 , when she fell ill in october 2010			1
fiance @entity37 kept a bedside vigil while @entity40 fought pneumonia five times ' i ’d had tonsillitis but i thought i ’d feel better when i got to @entity36			1
we ’d only been going out together for six weeks so i did n’t want to cancel			1
over the weekend her legs and feet became sore and numb			2
' it was like i had really bad pins and needles			2
' by the time the couple returned , she could n’t walk or speak and was rushed to @entity19			2
luckily , miss @entity7 was seen by a doctor who recognised she had @entity12 syndrome , despite it being so rare			1
she was immediately rushed to intensive care and put on a ventilator to breathe for her			0
' i was paralysed from head to toe - i did n’t know what was happening but i was so scared , ' she recalls			0
over the next four months her family kept a vigil at her bedside			0
and despite only being together a few weeks , mr @entity37 visited her every day			1
her family event ate their @entity64 dinner in the hospital so she would n’t miss out , even though she has no memory of the day			0
they , along with mr @entity37 and the nurses , kept diaries of everything she did - such as the slightest movement - and what was happening in the outside world to help her recover the time she lost			1
' when i woke up , mum told me how seriously ill i was and i just cried			0
i did n’t know what was going to happen to me			0
' but i cried more for the people around me having to watch how poorly i was			0
it was so hard on them			0
' doctors told miss @entity7 's family to prepare for the worst as she had a severe form of @entity12 syndrome nurses and family wrote diaries for @entity40 while she was sedated and on a ventilator in february last year , miss @entity7 slowly started to breathe on her own and doctors removed her ventilator			1
she was moved from intensive care to a ward and slowly began to get the feeling back in her arms and legs			0
with the help of physiotherapy , miss @entity7 had to re-learn how to do everything			1
' i could n’t even sit up by myself and had to learn how to hold a cup , brush my hair , clean my teeth			0
i ’d taken all these things for granted before			0
' it was very hard			0
i did n’t know if i would be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life			0
' but months later , she took her first steps with a walking frame and she was eventually strong enough to leave hospital			0
she has since returned to work and , better still , is busy planning her wedding after mr @entity37 proposed in february this year			0
' @entity37 has seen me at my worst but he stuck by me and has been my rock			0
i really would n’t be here without his and my family ’s support			0
' i ’m also so thankful to the doctors and nurses for saving my life			0
i still ca n’t believe something like tonsillitis caused it			1
' @entity12 ( pronounced @entity122 ) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body 's senses and movements			1
it affects about 1,500 people in the @entity130 every year and is slightly more common in men than women			1
it causes the immune system ( the body ’s natural defence against infection and illness ) to attack these nerves , causing them to become inflamed			1
symptoms include a tingly , numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement			2
most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection ( such as tonsillitis ) a few weeks before			1
around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months , and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage			2
