by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 16:53 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 24 september 2013 critical : @entity3 said well - off @entity4 should give their wealth to charity rather than passing large homes on to their children @entity3 yesterday criticised well - off @entity4 who buy large houses to pass on to their children instead of giving their wealth to charity			1
he said the country needed to adopt a culture of philanthropy like that of the @entity15 , where there is a ‘ culture of giving and being recognised as givers ’			1
despite owning a large house in @entity20 , @entity21 , and a £ 2.3million home in a fashionable part of @entity24 , the father - of - five criticised those who ‘ desperately ’ aimed to amass property wealth to pass on to their offspring ‘ for some unknown reason ’			1
the former @entity31 mp earns £ 143,911 as @entity24 mayor , and four years ago described the £ 250,000 he is paid for writing a column in a national newspaper as ‘ chicken feed ’			1
he has also written several books , from which he earns an income			0
critics last night claimed his comments were hypocritical , given the @entity43 - educated mayor ’s privileged upbringing			2
@entity45 mp @entity44 said : ‘ i ’m sure lots of people who ’ve worked hard and want to pass on something to their children will not take kindly to being lectured by an over-privileged politician like @entity3 who ’s been living pretty high on the hog his whole life			2
the way to encourage philanthropy is certainly not by going around insulting people			0
@entity3 really should know better			0
’ mr @entity3 was speaking in @entity24 alongside philanthropic @entity56 mayor @entity55 , who was launching a competition to offer £ 4.2million to any @entity59 city that comes up with innovative ideas to solve urban problems			1
asked what he believed the barriers were to philanthropy in @entity4 , mr @entity3 said wealthy @entity4 just wanted to buy the largest ‘ schloss ’ – a castle or manor house – they could , adding : ‘ it ’s a cultural thing			1
the trouble with the people in this country is – and i ’ll get myself in terrible trouble here – is that what they really want to do when they ’ve amassed colossal wealth in @entity4 , is buy the biggest possible house they can with the most colossal grouse moorland they can find and then try in some desperate way to perpetuate it and to pass it on to their children , for some unknown reason			2
nice place : one of two properties owned by @entity3 - a north @entity24 town house ‘ in @entity15 they have a very different attitude in that they believe that if you have made a lot of money you should do something for society			1
‘ there ’s still something in @entity4 which regards giving on a huge scale as somehow ostentatious – that is absolutely ridiculous			0
‘ the sooner people get over their lust to buy great schlosses in the home counties – or indeed grouse moors – and give to great causes in @entity24 , the better			0
’ the three - times @entity56 mayor mr @entity55 , who is a multi-billionaire media mogul , has given much of his wealth to good causes			0
he said : ‘ some places in @entity59 look down on private philanthropy , arguing it takes away the responsibility of the government			0
‘ that ’s misguided because the government should do conventional things with the public ’s money , but society needs innovation and risk - takers and that ’s where private philanthropy fits in			0

mayor of @entity24 said @entity4 must adopt a culture of philanthropy , like @entity15
