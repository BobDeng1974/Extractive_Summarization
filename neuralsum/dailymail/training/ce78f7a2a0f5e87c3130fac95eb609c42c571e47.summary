glamorous : 23 - year - old @entity0 combines looking good with milking 500 cows three times a day with her long blonde hair extensions , cut - off denim shorts and perfectly applied fake tan , @entity0 , 23 , from @entity6 , certainly is n't your average farmer			1
but while she might look as though she spends her days in the beauty salon , work for the 23 - year - old begins at 5am and does n't stop until the sun goes down			1
her work includes milking 500 cows three times a day , overseeing calving and clearing the yard of muck , as well as feeding duties			2
despite the long hours and backbreaking work , @entity0 , who says her friends ' do n't really understand ' what she does , says she has no plans to ever do anything else			1
' dairy farming is a passion and it 's 24 hours a day , ' she explains			2
' i dream about cows in my sleep and then i wake up and think about them			2
' if i 'd been in it for the money , i would have done something else , ' she says , adding : ' i 'm obsessed with them ! ' but not everyone is amused by her choice of career , among them her mother @entity38 who confesses that she wishes @entity0 had chosen to do something else			1
' i do find that when i tell people my daughter 's a dairy farmer , they 're not all that impressed , ' she admits			1
' it does drive us round the bend sometimes that she 's so obsessed with it all			2
' i was slightly hoping that as she got into it , got more experienced she got she would think " this is too much like hard work " and get out			0
' but it did n't work out like that at all			2
the more she got into it , the more you could see that there was no turning back			0
' quite how obsessed with cows , in particular the @entity57 dairy breed , she is becomes clear when you watch @entity58 , the @entity59 reality series in which @entity0 stars			1
although co-stars @entity62 , 23 , and @entity63 , 26 , clearly adore their animals , only @entity0 has a bedroom full of cow - themed clothing , soft toys and posters			1
even her chat up lines include cows			2
' are you good at calf rearing or what ? ' she asks one hapless prospective suitor			0
' i 'm the best in the @entity75 ! i 'm a top calf rearer ! ' passionate : @entity0 loves all things @entity57 cow and gets up at 5am to milk 500 of them each day beautiful : @entity0 is based in @entity6 which sits on the @entity82 border and is prime dairy farming country fellow farmer : @entity62 , 23 , whose family own a herd of rare breed pigs , is more typical of young farmers ' there are definitely two sides to me , ' she sheepishly admits			1
' when i 'm at work , i 'm very focused but when i 'm at @entity95 , i like to go out , party hard and have a good time			0
' despite her penchant for enjoying the odd pint , most of @entity0 's life revolves around farming , whether studying for her degree in @entity104 or conducting a research project that involves raising 10 calves by hand			1
' i literally woke up one morning and decided i wanted to be a farmer and milk cows , ' she laughs			2
' it literally is an obsession			0
' like her mother , however , not everyone thinks @entity0 's passion for cattle should dictate her choice of career , although @entity0 herself is determined to prove them wrong			1
' you have got to be quite a strong personality if you 're female and you 're going to go into dairy farming , ' she explains			2
' i definitely do have a point to prove			0
' people do n't take me seriously because of how i look			0
the boys call me @entity124 because i 've got my blonde hair extensions in , false eyelashes in , my fake tan , my nails and stuff			1
i 'll prove them all wrong ! ' if i meet someone in the pub or i 'm out somewhere and they ask what i do and i say i milk cows , i actually have to get out my phone and show them pictures of me milking because they do n't believe it			1
' their first guess is usually a hairdresser or a beautician or something			0
i really have to persuade them that i do really do this			0
' it 's only when i start coming out with all the [ dairy farming ] terms , they 're like , " oh yeah , she does actually know what she 's talking about			0
" i 'm like , " @entity152 , there you go " ! ' for now , what the boys think is the least of her concerns			0
' i have n't really got time for somebody else , ' she admits			0
' if i wanted a boyfriend , i could get one , like tomorrow			0
but i do n't really have time to spend with anybody			0
' with 500 cows to milk three times a day , @entity0 's life is certainly a busy one but she does n't seem to mind in the slightest			1
' i think people really do call me the crazy calf lady , ' she giggles			0
' it 's funny though , so i do n't mind ! ' @entity0 appears on @entity172 , tonight at 9pm on @entity59			1
