@entity0 turned to social media on thursday , full of emotion after @entity4 manager @entity3 called him up for the first time			1
the @entity7 striker talked of ‘ pride ’ and ‘ honour ’ on @entity10 after being named in the squad for the @entity13 qualifier against @entity14 next friday and the friendly in @entity16 four days later			1
@entity0 , who has scored 26 goals for @entity7 this season , merits his place alongside @entity4 captain @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity24 ’s @entity23 is also in the squad but a niggling toe injury could see him play against @entity14 and sit out the @entity16 clash			1
scroll down for full squad @entity0 celebrates after scoring for @entity7 against @entity29 at @entity30 last month @entity0 rounds @entity32 goalkeeper @entity31 to score @entity7 ' second goal at @entity34 on march 7 ‘ the whole country is excited to see @entity0 , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ his rise has been fantastic			0
he has n’t been in the squad before , but he has to show he belongs			0
’ beyond that , poor @entity0 discovered what it is really like to be a senior international when he was immediately caught in a club - versus - country row			1
the lure of the @entity47 dollar has seen @entity7 agree to play @entity48 on may 30 , six days after the final game of the @entity51 season			2
that same weekend , the @entity4 squad meet to prepare for a friendly against the @entity54 on june 7 in @entity55 , followed by the @entity13 qualifier in @entity57 on june 14			1
there is also a possibility that @entity0 , a regular in @entity61 ’s under 21 squad , will be selected for the @entity62 starting on june 17			2
‘ playing for @entity4 at @entity60 level is more important than a friendly in @entity47 and i would be hypocritical if i did n’t give that answer , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ this business about being tired — he ’s played quite a lot of games but he ’s not played any more than @entity20 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and lots of other players			0
‘ if he needs a rest there ’s a great opportunity when the season ends , before our under 21s get together			0
you ca n’t expect me to say , “ oh no , i understand he will play in @entity47 and be resting when the @entity78 pitch up ”			0
’ @entity0 celebrates after scoring for @entity83 against @entity84 in a @entity86 qualifier last year still , @entity7 were adamant on thursday that @entity0 will travel to @entity47 to fulfil the @entity88 fixture			1
@entity0 , 21 , has played 42 times for @entity7 this season and his goals in three competitions — @entity51 , @entity92 and @entity93 — have earned him international recognition			1
inevitably , boss @entity95 would prefer the potential @entity96 to put his feet up this summer			0
there is a fear of burn - out			0
‘ we will speak ( with @entity3 )			2
it ’s a good chance to speak because @entity4 train here , ’ said @entity95 after @entity4 ’s squad of 24 was announced			2
‘ we always try to find what is best for the player			0
we need to understand every position , but we have a good relationship and after that ( talks with @entity3 ) we will take a decision			2
’ as for @entity0 , he is concerned only with proving himself to the @entity4 manager			1
‘ i ’ll be aiming to compete and get myself in the team , ’ he said			0
‘ there are a lot of great players there and i have n’t had time to think about what ’s happened but i ’m enjoying every minute and want it to continue			0
’ beyond the @entity0 situation , @entity3 had to attend to some general housekeeping at @entity120 on thursday , such as the knockout blow @entity122 seemed to land on his pal @entity20 at the captain ’s @entity124 home last month			1
@entity3 said he had no view on the incident , which was revealed last weekend in a sunday newspaper			2
‘ you will have to guess whether i am concerned but @entity20 ’s celebration against @entity7 was one way to take the sting out of the situation , ’ said @entity3			1
on monday , when the squad meet at @entity135 , it will be the first time @entity3 has seen them since november			2
he had hoped to meet the players at a dinner in january but club managers were against the idea			0
@entity4 manager @entity3 takes his seat before announcing his squad at @entity120 on thursday instead , @entity3 recorded a video message which was sent to the squad via @entity4 ’s video analyst @entity145 and was downloaded on to their @entity147			1
‘ i do n’t want to do the @entity149 bit to find out who has and who has n’t watched it , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i did an introduction to each video and then @entity155 and @entity156 talked over the actual clips			0
‘ it will break the ice that can develop when the last game was in november and your next one is in march			0
‘ whether they found it a worthwhile exercise , i do n’t know			0
if it ’s not , then it ’s an awful lot of work to do for nothing			0
