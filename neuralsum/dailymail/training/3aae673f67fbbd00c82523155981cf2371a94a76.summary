urgent new rules were introduced last night to protect journalists and whistleblowers from police snooping			2
mps agreed to rush safeguards through @entity6 before the general election to curtail the use of the hugely controversial @entity9			2
police will now need the approval of a judge , via an order , before they can access phone records to try to identify a reporter ’s sources			1
controversial : police have obtained the phone records of dozens of journalists , which led to the sacking of three police officers who lawfully leaked information about @entity25 's ( pictured ) ' @entity24 ' scandal newspapers , including the @entity27 , demanded changes to the rules when it emerged that police had secretly launched spying missions to get the phone records of two journalists investigating wrongdoing by @entity4			1
it has since emerged that police forces have viewed the phone records of 82 journalists over the past three years via @entity9 , which is supposedly an anti-terror law			1
the system operates in secret and there is no provision for journalists to challenge it			0
@entity44 investigating @entity45 ( above ) used @entity9 to obtain a @entity27 on sunday reporter 's records the concern was that , if newspapers ’ sources are not protected , whistleblowers will be deterred from contacting the press – and scandals will remain secret			0
the new rules are a temporary measure because there was no time to change the primary @entity9 legislation before the current @entity6 ends on march 30			0
if police wish to view journalists ’ phone records they will have to give notice to the parties involved and , if necessary , make the case for disclosure in court			1
the @entity67 said there is a commitment to introduce a law after the election to reform @entity9			0
the @entity72 claimed the @entity74 side of the @entity75 had been slow to act			0
@entity77 detectives used the call records of @entity80 ’s political editor , @entity79 , to find and sack three officers found to have lawfully leaked information about the @entity24 incident			0
@entity44 investigating the @entity45 speeding points scandal used @entity9 to obtain the phone records of a journalist on @entity87 and one of his sources , even though a judge had ruled the source should remain confidential			1
in the controversy that followed , the @entity93 and @entity94 launched the @entity97 campaign , which was backed by more than 100 editors .			2

mps rushed *interim* safeguards backed by 100 editors through @entity6
police must now ask a judge before accessing journalists ' phone records
it came after alarm over use of ' anti-terror ' law to root out whistleblowers
forces secretly viewed records of 82 journalists in the last three years
