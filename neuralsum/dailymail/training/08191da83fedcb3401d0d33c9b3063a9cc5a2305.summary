the mother of a four - year - old girl mauled to death by their pet bulldog has spoken of her agony at losing her ' bubbly ' daughter in such horrific circumstances			1
@entity8 was killed when the family 's newly - adopted @entity10 - type bulldog attacked her as watched tv during a sick day off school			1
an inquest heard how the dog suddenly attacked @entity8 , targeting her throat , while her mother @entity17 frantically tried to stop the attack before stabbing the dog to death with a kitchen knife			1
in a family statement , read today by a police officer outside the coroner 's court , ms @entity17 said : ' the last 10 months have been extremely difficult for me and all who knew and loved @entity8			1
' she was a bubbly girl who always had a smile and brought happiness to everyone she met			0
' we still think about her every day and she lives on in our hearts as we have such wonderful memories of her			0
@entity8 ( pictured ) died from facial injuries and suffocation caused by the dog 's jaws covering her mouth she added : ' her death is still too painful to talk about			1
i would like to thank all my family , friends and the members of the public for their support over the last 10 months			0
' without them the ordeal would have been far worse and i 'm taking each day as it comes and hopefully in time the tragic events of that afternoon will ease			0
' earlier today , the inquest heard the kennels supplying the large and powerful dog never carried out a home visit			1
the dog had been assessed as suitable for re-homing by staff at @entity55 , but with a note it may not be right for a home with ' smaller children '			1
yesterday , ms @entity17 said she had met the dog at the kennels for 15 minutes , and querying the note , was told this was down to its size and ' a tendency to jump up '			1
@entity67 also said it showed no sign of aggression , was ' placid ' , and had ' a lovely temperament '			0
senior coroner @entity72 asked @entity74 ' owner @entity73 about its policy and procedures on re-homing			0
mr @entity72 said : ' i 'm trying to establish the circumstances in which a home visit would be appropriate			2
' so we have a large dog , large and powerful - a note it might be better re-homed in a home with no small children			1
' he added staff also knew ms @entity17 lived in a ground - floor , two - bed flat , then asked mr @entity73 : ' when would you consider it appropriate to visit that home ? ' a sign for @entity94 dog re-homing centre , from where the bulldog was picked up by ms @entity17 pictured is @entity98 , the bulldog which killed @entity8			1
unknown to the kennels , the dog had a history of aggressive behaviour and during its time with a previous owner , had attacked another dog @entity8 ( pictured ) was attacked by the bulldog while she was watching tv during a sick day off school mr @entity73 said it depended on factors including the potential owner 's knowledge of dogs and personal circumstances			1
he also said : ' the dog was not a big dog , it was labrador - sized			2
' however , yesterday kennel staff said the dog was too big to do a ' pick - up ' test , which is used to assess an animal 's temperament			2
mr @entity73 added home visits were not always needed in line with industry guidance			0
none of the staff at the kennels , which was contracted by @entity130 to take its strays until last november , had had any external training			0
at the conclusion of the inquest mr @entity73 extended his sympathies to the family			0
@entity94 owner @entity73 pictured leaving the inquest today he said the evidence had shown its re-homing procedures were ' in accordance with the principles employed by other similar organisations ' , and that nobody had ' detected the slightest hint of aggression in the dog ' prior to its attack			1
' if we had been told that the previous keepers were concerned about aggressive behaviour and were worried about the possibility of such conduct towards their children , then the animal would have been euthanised in our facility and in any other responsible facility			2
' flowers and tributes left outside the home of @entity8 and her mother last year in the wake of the horrific attack recording his short narrative verdict today , @entity72 , senior coroner for @entity165 and @entity166 , said : ' @entity8 died as a result of injuries received in an attack upon her by a dog within her home			1
' he added : ' this must rank as one of the most harrowing cases			0
' i know it can not have been easy to those nearest and dearest to @entity8 to have sat through the evidence			2
' he added : ' i offer my sincere condolences to the members of the family and friends who lost a lovely little girl tragically , in the circumstances we have heard			0
' mr @entity72 said there was ' no question of apportioning blame ' , but said he would be writing a report with recommendations to try and strengthen the rules around re-homing stray dogs			0
in closing the inquest today , he said his report would be directed at ' the appropriate authorities '			0
yesterday the coroner heard @entity8 's mother describe the fatal attack			1
she said the powerful bulldog started ' staring ' at her little daughter , before going ' straight for her throat '			2
desperate to get the animal - called @entity98 - off the girl , she tried to smash a glass over the dog , then pull its legs apart , before trying to pry its jaws loose			0
she rushed to the kitchen and ' grabbed the largest knife i could find ' , plunging the blade repeatedly into the dog which eventually released @entity8			1
the little girl , off sick from school that day , died from facial injuries and suffocation caused by the dog 's jaws covering her mouth , a post mortem found			2
yesterday the coroner heard an account of the attack from @entity8 's mother @entity17 ( pictured outside the courthouse today ) , who described stabbing the animal to death with a kitchen knife after it began mauling her daughter a series of kennel staff told mr @entity72 the dog had shown no aggressive behaviour , with one describing it as ' very sweet natured ' with a ' lovely temperament '			1
however , @entity98 had recently attacked another family pet at its previous home - a fact unknown to both the kennels and ms @entity17			1
the dog only ended up at the kennels when the previous male owner lied to the council dog warden , telling them it was a stray , so he would not have to pay to have it re-homed			2
detective sergeant @entity249 , of @entity250 , said it had attacked that previous owner 's other dog in the back garden of his @entity130 home			2
that owner also told the @entity257 he was ' concerned for the safety of his own children ' following the attack			2
but while dog warden @entity261 told the inquest @entity98 had ' seemed ok ' when she first picked it up , a note was shown to court where the warden had described the animal as looking ' like she has been fighting , with marks all over her face '			1
mr @entity72 , recording a short narrative verdict , said there was ' no question of apportioning blame ' , but said he would be writing a report with recommendations to try and ' prevent future such deaths '			0
outside the court , the little girl 's grandparents welcomed mr @entity72 's move and said they were ' very surprised ' no standard set of rules governing the re-homing of strays already existed			0
@entity284 and @entity285 said : ' we 're glad he 's going to recommend some changes be made regulating the law on re-homing stray dogs			0
they added : ' we 're surprised nothing like that already exists			0
' i think people , like we did , just assume those rules are in place , but they 're not			0

mother 's statement : ' her death is still too painful to talk about '
the kennels from which the bulldog was re-homed never carried out check
note stated the dog may not be suitable for home with ' small children '
@entity17 said she was told it was because dog had tendency to ' jump up '
several weeks later , the bulldog mauled her daughter @entity8 , 4 , to death
