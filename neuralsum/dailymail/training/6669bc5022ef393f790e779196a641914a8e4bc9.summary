weathered and war - weary , these are the @entity2 warriors fighting to free a country for which many have fought before			1
they are the @entity6 volunteers on the battlefield of @entity9 's bloody war against the @entity11 jihadis ravaging their homeland			2
and while many look like they 'd better belong in line for a free bus pass than on the frontline , their advancing years belie their bravery			2
dressed proudly in handed - down uniforms , they yield weapons leftover from bygone wars , including @entity20 dating from the 1960s			1
one day , alongside a tank , @entity37 grenade launcher and a handful of machine guns , these were all they had to fight with			2
by contrast , the @entity43 fighters are armed with state - of - the - art weaponry stolen from the @entity26 army or seized from wayward @entity48 airdrops meant for @entity49			1
where these seasoned soldiers negotiate the muddy roads ( we saw heavy rain for five days here ) in four - wheel - drives , @entity43 have hummers			1
nevertheless , they have no choice but to fight with what they have - despite hollow promises from the @entity48 and @entity62 to arm them adequately			1
one , who did not want to give his name but has returned to @entity9 from @entity65 where he has lived for many years , told me his @entity68 is indeed from the 1960s			2
' my weapon is an @entity68 that i saved up my own money for and bought on the black market to fight @entity43 to save my country , ' he tells me proudly , holding his rattling rifle with both hands			1
general @entity75 is among the men lost one of their eyes during the @entity79			1
undeterred by the bloody conflict in the 80s , he has taken up arms to defend his native @entity9 the group 's repertoire of weapons include rusty @entity20 from the 1960s including this one , bought by a fighter on the black market dressed proudly in handed down uniforms from by - gone wars , the fighters said they desperately need modern guns in order to go up against @entity43 jihadis many of the men are grandfathers determined not to stand idly by as their country is ravaged by terrorists ' of course we want better guns but we have no choice			1
' yes , we desperately need modern guns , any type would be better than this			0
it 's no different to you using needing a new car , pc or laptop			0
' technology has changed so we have to be like all other countries that have proper armies with everything new and modern weapons			0
' he is very clear as to where the new weapons should come from			0
' they should come from the countries that created this situation ; the countries that brought their armies to @entity9 then left			0
' but if any countries will send us weapons it would be greatly appreciated			0
' on the resources held by @entity43 , he says : ' they have good weapons from the @entity48 as well as all the weapons which @entity131 gave them			1
' their weapons are much stronger than ours - there is such a huge difference ... but we can still beat them			1
' many of the men bare scars of the bloody @entity141 of the mid- 1980s , when they fought with @entity142 against forces loyal to @entity144			0
some left after that war , emigrating to @entity62 in search of a better life for their families			0
but amid a new threat to their homeland , they have returned in their droves to fight			0
one of the men stands proudly on the @entity27 frontline dressed in a @entity156 hand - down uniform wearing sweaters , shirts and lace - up shoes , the unlikely army has managed to fend off advances from @entity43 on some of the region 's roads in makeshift accommodation near the frontline the men gear up for another day of fighting in mismatching uniforms the men stand in makeshift uniforms looking out across the @entity27 frontline with their rusty weapons by their side despite their advancing age and rusty resources , the small army of vigilantes has been able to defeat @entity43 in small victories , such as taking back control of a seized road a rusty grenade and a water pouch rest on a man 's belt made from a scarf , his rifle tucked under his arm an elderly fighter rests his gun on a make - shift look out point in the desert in @entity27 , @entity9 , where @entity43 have been storming towns and ravaging villages many of the men fled the @entity196 in the 1980s for @entity62 in search of a better life for their families but have returned amid the threat of @entity43 cleaning their rusty rifles , two @entity6 fighters sit cross-legged on the @entity27 front preparing for yet more conflict many of the men bear scars from the @entity141 in which they fought alongside @entity142 against forces loyal to @entity144 while older fighters lead the dysfunctional army , youngsters have followed by example , many wishing to be like their fathers and grandfathers as men most of the weapons used by the group have been bought on the black market collected from previous wars a few machine guns lined up to overlook the @entity27 front are among the group 's only weaponry the group prepares a meal together in their accommodation on the @entity27 frontline still dressed in their uniforms bulletproof vests are among the rare items which resemble modern army uniforms worn by the group with their weapons cast off nearby the men pray behind closed doors before re-entering the frontline			1
right , a fighter climbs atop their only tank i am shocked at how many of the men have only one eye - the others , many tell me , were blown from their sockets by malfunctioning , poorly - made mortar 's of that @entity245			2
some tell me i am the only journalist they have seen here in months			0
others say i am the first one they have ever seen			0
last week , they lost the road to @entity250 , but retook it a few days later , killing three enemy fighters			0
moving about is difficult here too			0
the roads are littered with hidden mines , left by retreating @entity43 fighters who are paying local farmers to booby - trap their land			1
yet this is a position of key strategic significance ; just 500 metres to the south , i can see @entity43 flags with my bare eyes			1
some of the group have n't seen a journalist in the area for months , while others claim none have been at all with the @entity6 flag flying proudly the men lookout from their position atop a hill in @entity27 while @entity43 operates in hummers , the small group have no choice but to navigate the treacherous roads in 4x4s a young boy stands on the army 's only tank behind a wall of dirt and dust on the frontline soldering on : one of the men poses with a youngster proudly toting a gun			1
despite their poor resources and ill - fitting uniforms , the army is made up of the bravest fighters seen for miles hope : a @entity6 flag waves from the back of one of the group 's few vehicles despite the region 's roads being compromised by @entity43 fighters i do n't even need binoculars to see smoke rising from their kitchens or the black shapes of men running from house to house			1
the @entity49 however are not frightened by such proximity			0
for them death is part of their natural fate			0
they accept it will happen to them sooner or later - if not tomorrow then next week , next year or in a decade 's time			2
when it was time for me to go back in @entity319 , the @entity6 capital in @entity9 , they drove me along one of the most dangerous roads in the area after hearing the usual route was cut off			0
even if they look like an army from another century , they are some of the bravest men i have ever met ; they will defend their country to the end .			2

the *veterans* have taken up arms in @entity26 towns *threatened* by @entity43
