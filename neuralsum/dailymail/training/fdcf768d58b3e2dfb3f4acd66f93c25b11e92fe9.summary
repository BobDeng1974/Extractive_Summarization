@entity0 and @entity1 have it all to do in their final group matches if they are to qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity6			1
the two @entity8 sides know they need to pick up positive results to reach the last 16 , although games elsewhere can affect their progression			0
with that in mind , @entity12 explains what @entity1 and @entity0 must do to make it through and the positions of the two other @entity19 sides in the @entity6 , @entity20 and @entity21 , who have both already sealed their places in the knockout rounds			1
@entity1 's players celebrate @entity27 ( bottom ) scoring a late winner against @entity30 @entity0 ( vs @entity31 at @entity32 , tuesday december 9 ) only a win against @entity31 on tuesday will do			2
@entity35 ' side are currently on four points but another three at @entity32 will move them above their @entity39 opponents , who have six at present			0
@entity41 can also get to seven points with an unlikely win away at group winners @entity44 , but @entity0 would still go through by virtue of the head - to - head rule after beating the @entity48 side on home soil and drawing away last month			2
@entity50 ( right ) runs past @entity51 during @entity0 's defeat against @entity31 in october @entity1 ( vs @entity53 at @entity54 , wednesday december 10 ) if @entity55 draw away to @entity30 , @entity1 will qualify by beating @entity53 in the @entity57 capital			1
or , if @entity59 lose to @entity30 , a score draw will do for @entity61 's men			0
if the @entity63 side somehow manage to win in @entity64 , @entity1 are out no matter what their result			0
@entity53 defender @entity67 ( left ) slides in on @entity68 during his side 's draw against @entity1 @entity21 ( vs @entity71 at @entity72 , tuesday december 9 ) @entity21 guaranteed their place in the round of 16 with a win against group leaders @entity77 last time out			1
they will finish second in @entity78 unless they beat @entity71 and @entity77 lose to @entity79 ( or , more unlikely , the @entity81 side draw â€” and @entity21 win by seven )			2
@entity82 ( centre ) scored a hat - trick as @entity21 beat @entity71 4 - 1 at the @entity85 in october @entity20 ( vs @entity86 at @entity87 , wednesday december 10 ) @entity20 sealed top spot in @entity89 with a 5 - 0 win away at @entity91 in their last group game			1
the @entity94 side know a point in @entity96 will guarantee qualification , although they will definitely go through if @entity91 fail to beat @entity98			0
@entity99 ( left ) could be rested in @entity20 's return fixture with @entity94 side @entity86			0

@entity0 must beat @entity31 at @entity32 to progress in the @entity6
@entity1 may only need a point at @entity53 but could also get knocked out if they win in @entity57
@entity21 have already guaranteed progression and could finish top
