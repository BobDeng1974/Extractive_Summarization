@entity0 changed his diet after being persuaded by wife @entity2 @entity4 coach joins @entity5 and @entity6 on diet the 37 - year - old is set to be sacked as @entity4 coach @entity0 was told by executive vice chairman @entity10 he has no future at @entity12 after sunday 's @entity13 1 - 1 draw at @entity15 goalkeeping coach @entity16 has also been axed by @entity17 @entity18 wants @entity4 to not panic buy this summer @entity0 insists the club should promote youth rather than going for lesser targets @entity0 has swapped allegiances , from red to green , as the former @entity4 player has become a vegetarian			1
the 37 - year - old has been on a meat - free diet for a few weeks after his wife @entity2 persuaded him to do so and it is a decision @entity0 has n't regretted			1
' i thought if i became a vegetarian that would take away a lot of the nutrients that i would require to be a professional footballer and an athlete			0
' @entity0 is the latest professional sportsperson to opt for a vegetarian diet which includes tennis star @entity6 , former athlete @entity51 and boxer @entity5			1
the former @entity53 international rejoined @entity4 as a coach at the start of the season as part of former @entity60 ' boss @entity59 ' backroom staff			2
eyes on the prize : tennis star @entity6 has also opted a meat - free diet in her life however , after a tumultuous campaign at the club he was informed by executive vice chairman @entity10 that , along with goalkeeping coach @entity16 , he had no future at the club following @entity4 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity15 on sunday			1
@entity0 's older brother @entity71 believed the deposed @entity13 champions have panicked in the transfer market and the wants the club to only spend their money on quality signings			1
speaking on @entity77 , @entity0 hopes expected @entity4 boss @entity79 fine tunes the squad where necessary in order for the the club to compete for honours again			1
‘ @entity84 is potentially going to get the job and he will have to asses it			0
it wo n’t happen overnight , but they have a great chance to get back into the @entity90 , especially as they have no @entity94 football next season , ' he said			0
‘ if he decides he wants eight players , that does n’t mean he should go and buy eight players			0
signing three or four real top quality – and improving next season , bedding them in and then going again with two or three more the year after is the organic approach i would expect @entity4 to have			2
‘ however , i did n’t expect @entity4 to sack a manager after ten months , so what ’s going to happen in the next few months , who knows ? ' panic buy : @entity106 joined @entity4 for £ 27.5million on deadline day in august under sacked @entity4 boss @entity59 , the club struggled to acquire their much publicised summer targets - something @entity0 does n't want a repeat of			1
‘ @entity4 have panicked into signing players who were not the top choices , ' he added			2
‘ it was quite public last summer who @entity4 ’s targets were – it was either @entity119 or @entity120 , it was @entity121 , it was @entity122 and it was @entity106			2
they were the targets , it was publicised – and i do n’t know why because @entity4 have always kept their transfer dealings really quiet			2
i ’m not quite sure how all of a sudden everyone knows who they are signing			0
dream debut : @entity131 ( left ) scored twice on his @entity4 debut in a 3 - 1 vs @entity133 in may ‘ but if they ca n’t get no 1 , no 2 , three or four - i ’m not in a rush			1
as a @entity4 fan , i ’d rather seen @entity131 come through than some fourth choice striker who is n’t at the top of the list			0
‘ i do n’t want signing number eight , nine or 10 , because they ca n’t get no 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 - i have no interest in that			0
‘ i ’m a supporter too , i want signings , as fan			0
i ( only ) want quality players			0
