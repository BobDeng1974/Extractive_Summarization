a giant doorway to another universe may exist at the centre of the @entity3 , and it could be large enough to swallow spaceships whole			1
this is according to a recent study which claims it would be possible to travel through a wormhole in a similar way to moving through the space - time tunnel in the film @entity10			1
wormholes , allowing instantaneous travel between distant points in space and time , are allowed under @entity16 's theory of @entity17			2
wormholes ( artists 's impression pictured ) are thought to allow travel between distant points in space and time but most scientists dismiss the idea of ever building one large and stable enough to pass through , and no natural examples have been detected			1
the extraordinary new theory , published in the journal @entity31 , follows the discovery of what appears to be a super-massive black hole at the centre of our galaxy			1
according to the @entity43 authors , the black hole - a region of concentrated gravity that distorts space - time - may be a wormhole in disguise			1
the scientists , who base their conclusion on complex mathematical models , say the portal could be constructed from dark matter			1
this is invisible and mysterious material making up around 26 per cent of the universe			0
a recent study claims it would be possible to travel through a wormhole in a similar way to moving through the space - time tunnel ( right ) in the film @entity10			1
pictured on the left is the spaceship from the film the researchers combined the map of the dark matter in the @entity3 with the most recent @entity65 model to explain the universe			1
space - time can be warped and distorted			0
it takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions , but theoretically , distortions are possible			2
in the case of the wormhole , a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space - time			2
imagine folding a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it to represent two points in space - time			0
the line between them shows the distance from one point to the other in normal space - time			0
if the paper is now bent and folded over almost double - the equivalent to warping space - time - then poking the pencil through the paper provides a much shorter way of linking the two points , in the same way a wormhole would create a shortcut			2
the problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are inherently unstable			2
when a particle enters a wormhole , it also creates fluctuations that cause the structure to collapse in on it			0
' what we get is that our galaxy could really contain one of these tunnels , and that the tunnel could even be the size of the galaxy itself , ' said professor @entity112 , from the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity43			0
' but there 's more			0
we could even travel through this tunnel , since , based on our calculations , it could be navigable			0
just like the one we 've all seen in the recent film ' @entity10 ''			0
he said the research was surprisingly close to what was depicted in director @entity124 's movie , for which theoretical physicist @entity125 provided technical assistance			0
' what we tried to do in our study was to solve the very equation that the astrophysicist ' @entity130 ' was working on , ' said prof @entity112			0
' clearly we did it long before the film came out			0
' any wormholes existing in nature have previously been assumed to be microscopic rips in the fabric of space - time			0
but the one possibly lying at the centre of the @entity3 would be large enough to swallow up a spaceship			1
professor @entity112 added : ' obviously we 're not claiming that our galaxy is definitely a wormhole , but simply that , according to theoretical models , this hypothesis is a possibility			1
' other ' spiral ' galaxies similar to the @entity3 - like its neighbour @entity150 - may also contain wormholes , the scientists believe			1
theoretically it might be possible to test the idea by comparing the @entity3 with a different type of nearby galaxy , such as one of the irregular @entity157			1
any wormholes existing in nature have previously been assumed to be microscopic rips in the fabric of space - time			0
but the one possibly lying at the centre of the @entity3 would be large enough to swallow up a spaceship , according to the latest study			1
pictured is an artist 's impression in their paper , the scientists write : ' our result is very important because it confirms the possible existence of wormholes in most of the spiral galaxies			1
. ' dark matter may supply the fuel for constructing and sustaining a wormhole			1
' hence , wormholes could be found in nature and our study may encourage scientists to seek observational evidence for wormholes in the galactic halo region			1
' the study follows similar research last year in which physicists at @entity189 arguedthat some wormholes are capable of staying open long enough to send messages backwards and forwards through time			2
‘ my calculations showed that if a wormhole is very long compared to how wide it is , you can get negative energy created in the centre of the wormhole , ' said professor @entity203 ‘ it ’s not quite the right sort to keep the wormhole stable – which is what i ’d hoped - but it does mean the wormhole collapses very slowly ' the wormhole would be open just long enough , dr @entity203 suggests , to send a photon through to the centre			0
because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time , if professor @entity203 ’s theory proves correct , a message could be sent through time			2
space - time can be warped and distorted			0
it takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions , but theoretically , distortions are possible.in the case of the wormhole , a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space - time ( artist 's impression pictured )			2

if a wormhole exists , it would be large enough to swallow a spaceship
theory follows discovery of a super-massive black hole in our galaxy
this black hole may be a wormhole in disguise , according to the study
the scientists believe the portal could be constructed from dark matter
they have based their conclusion on complex mathematical models
other galaxies , similar to the @entity3 , may also contain wormholes
