@entity0 vs @entity1 @entity2 @entity3 , @entity4 sunday 1 february - 11.30pm gmt the way that the @entity6 builds a city around an american football event is phenomenal			1
i was speaking to a couple of @entity12 journalists this week who were saying that this was the first time that they had been out to @entity16 for the @entity17			1
they just ca n’t believe how the whole city has become engulfed by the @entity6 and the @entity17			1
the commercial investment that has been put into the game is huge			1
i know there are a lot of cultural differences and we are very different to the @entity16 in the way we see sport , but imagine if we could make a bigger spectacle out of the @entity30 final			1
even if it ’s just getting players at a press conference or giving fans access to players to be able to see them in the build - up to the final , that ’s a small step that i think would make a massive difference			1
opening the game up to the fans and letting the fans have some access to maybe a practice or a meet and greet would make the event more personal			1
the state of @entity4 will host @entity17 49 between the @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 in @entity3 is all quiet leading up to the blockbuster event recording artist @entity50 performs on stage during a festival organised just next to the stadium around 100,000 people attended the festival on thursday as they enjoyed @entity17 week what i ’ve witnessed this week is mind - blowing			1
in downtown @entity60 it is like a walking @entity61			0
there are players from every generation of the game walking around just soaking up the atmosphere			0
it would make a huge difference to the @entity30 final if we started to consider how we could market it and make it a bigger event , not necessarily on this scale			1
we went to an event on thursday when @entity50 was djing and they literally built @entity78 next door to the stadium			1
there were around 100,000 people there - it was that big			1
even though it was raining it had that festival atmosphere			0
it ’s that kind of commercial investment that makes a massive difference			0
they were all student - looking types at the festival , but it is all part of the @entity17 and based around that			1
you might not be a football fan , but you ’ll still enjoy the activities provided by these big corporate companies because they ’re in town for the @entity17			2
@entity99 will perform during the half - time show on sunday night at the @entity2 the @entity102 singer brought her dog to a press conference this week as she addressed the media former @entity107 49ers quarterback @entity106 ( right ) at an event in @entity60 on thursday actor @entity109 ( left ) and rapper @entity110 ( right ) perform at a @entity111 during @entity17 weekend there are parties everywhere with all the big - names like @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			1
and obviously you ca n’t help but avoid all the chicken wings , the loaded potato skins and the pitchers of ale flying around			0
if we could maybe bring the people of the @entity125 and @entity126 over and just show them what the @entity16 do , we might be able to start to do something like this at home			2
@entity131 there are a lot of aspects to this game that are very similar to last year			2
once again we have got the very young @entity136 , playing in his second @entity17 on the bounce , going up against one of the grand masters of the game in @entity141 , who is making his sixth @entity17 appearance and won three already			1
i would argue that @entity141 is probably the best quarterback to play the game			0
everybody knows how good the @entity1 are on offense			2
the key for the @entity0 defense is containing the read option ( where the quarterback has the option of giving the ball to the running back or instead holding onto it and running around the outside )			2
if the @entity0 can shut down the outside run and read option then they have got a real chance of containing the @entity1 offense			1
the @entity1 defense is without doubt one of the best defensive groups we have seen in recent times			2
the ‘ @entity168 ’ are the best group of defensive backs in the @entity6			0
they are very talented , very quick and all quite tall			0
it is quite intimidating for wide receivers of the opposing team to see			0
the @entity1 defensive backs do n’t show many different looks in their defensive formation , but they ’re so quick and so fast in closing down opposing teams			1
@entity141 is preparing to play in his sixth @entity17 having won three titles already @entity141 and his @entity0 team - mates practice in @entity179 , @entity4 in the lead up to sunday 's showdown @entity136 will play in his second straight @entity17 having been in the league for just three seasons i think @entity141 will struggle because the @entity1 defensive line is very quick			1
@entity141 likes to sit in the pocket and is not very mobile			0
he will stand in the pocket for the longest time until he finds a receiver who is wide open			0
i think the @entity1 will focus on that and blitz a lot			2
they wo n’t necessarily put a spy on @entity141 because he does n’t run , but they ’ll use the extra man to blitz			0
tight end @entity194 is going to be one of @entity141 ’s key targets			0
against the @entity197 , the @entity0 mixed up the run and the pass			2
if they can establish the run game on sunday it will help them when they try and pass , because the @entity1 defense will be leaning towards stopping the run			1
@entity206 used to be head coach of the @entity0 before @entity208 fired him and that ’s when the @entity211 era began , so @entity206 might have a chip on his shoulder			2
@entity0 tight end @entity194 is fitter and healthier this season than he has been for a long time @entity1 cornerback @entity216 speaks out during media day in @entity60 @entity206 ( left ) was sacked as @entity0 head coach and replaced by @entity211 ( right ) @entity136 led the @entity1 to a crushing 43 - 8 victory over the @entity220 last year in @entity221 people in town have been saying that if you give @entity0 head coach @entity211 two weeks to prepare then he is going to come up schemes , plays and formations that the opposing team night not necessarily have seen on film			1
after last year ’s catastrophe of me calling the @entity220 to win - and we all know what happened there - i ’m going to toe the line on this one			1
i think it ’s going to be a close game and i hope it goes down to the fourth quarter			1
@entity242 's silence i have seen @entity244 ’s press conferences and it is quite amusing to sit and watch him and listen to what he has n’t got to say			0
we saw commissioner @entity249 ’s press conference on friday and he was asked about @entity244			0
the commissioner is right in saying that we have all got jobs to do and there are some elements to our job that we do n’t really like but we have to do them to fulfill the role and our positions			0
but american football teams have 60 different players , so why keep putting up a guy who does n’t say anything ? we are not going to get anything from him , so put another running back in			0
@entity244 has been at the centre of attention this week for what he has n't said to the media @entity6 commissioner @entity249 said that people have to do parts of their jobs they might not like @entity273 's favourite super bowl moments 3			2
@entity275 39 - 20 @entity220 - @entity276 , january 25 , 1987 this was the year i really got into @entity279 and i knew the rules and what to look out for			1
the sun setting over the iconic @entity283 in @entity102 made the whole event look beautiful			0
i remember watching up to the end of the first quarter and had school the next morning			0
but my mum stayed up and recorded the game on @entity290 but paused the adverts , because if you did n’t pause the adverts you would n’t get the whole game on one tape			0
that @entity17 started a period of about 10 years where my mum or dad would pause the adverts to get it all on a @entity290 video			2
in that game we saw @entity303 and @entity304 and two iconic teams			0
that ’s one @entity17 i remember for it ’s visual beauty			2
the iconic @entity283 in @entity308 , @entity102 on the day of @entity309 in 1987 head coach @entity310 is lifted into the air after the @entity275 beat the @entity220 @entity275 running back @entity312 scores a touchdown at the @entity283 in @entity102 2			2
@entity314 27 - 23 @entity316 - @entity315 , february 1 , 2009 this was the first @entity17 i watched live and i was fortunate enough to be sat just over the end zone when @entity320 threw the final touchdown to win the game for the @entity314			1
little did i know that the wide receivers coach for the @entity324 , @entity323 , was on that squad and he won a @entity17 ring in that game			1
@entity328 celebrates catching the game - winning touchdown for the @entity314 in 2009 1			0
@entity331 46 - 10 @entity0 - @entity309 , january 26 , 1986 this was the first @entity16 game that i ever saw			1
it was one of the best defenses that had ever played the game			0
i was n’t aware at the time , but as i slowly taught myself about the history of the game , i realised that @entity331 defense was one of the best to play the game			0
it was also the first time i saw @entity343 run the football and they had @entity346 aka ' @entity346 '			0
that was the season that made him a household name , even in @entity12			0
the @entity331 dominate the @entity0 to win @entity309 in @entity350 @entity343 runs the ball for the @entity331 ( left ) as @entity346 aka ' @entity346 celebrates ( right ) @entity273 presents @entity352 on @entity353			1
the @entity17 coverage starts at 22.30pm sunday 1st february .			0

@entity0 take on @entity1 in @entity17
state of @entity4 has put on a phenomenal show this week
the events staged as part of the @entity17 build - up appeal to everybody , not just @entity279 *followers*
there was an event this week where @entity50 was djing and there were around 100,000 people there for a festival
we could try and make the @entity30 a bigger event and spectacle by following some of the *examples* of this @entity17 week
after picking the @entity220 to win last year , i *'m* going to toe the line this time but hope for a close game that goes all the way
