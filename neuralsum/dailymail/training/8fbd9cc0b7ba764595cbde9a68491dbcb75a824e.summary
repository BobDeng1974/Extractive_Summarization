the @entity12 beauty salon owner said : ' as it stands i have no relationship in my life , i would love to find love			1
' it was time for me to get my balls out and move on and find someone and a situation that is going to work moving forward for me and my son in the future			0
' still keeping quiet as to the identity of the gentleman in question , @entity4 explained that they are , ' not in a relationship '			1
she goes on to add : ' it was very emotional when i said what i did , it was a true reflection of how i felt - even though i used the wrong word and it got misinterpreted , after five bottles of champagne my lips got carried away with themselves			1
' but i was quite happy to be honest and open with the girls			0
' at the time of her confession @entity4 was hosting a dinner party for her fellow housewives @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 at her lavish @entity5 home			1
@entity4 with her co-stars from the hit @entity66 show @entity67 of @entity5 ( @entity68 ) @entity69 , @entity60 , @entity59 , @entity61 and @entity62 becoming frustrated that they would n't stop talking about their happy love lives @entity4 blurted her revelation to her stunned cast mates			1
the tv show follows the lives and loves of the six woman , @entity4 is the odd one out of the bunch as being single she is not technically a ' housewife '			1
this is n't the first romance of @entity4 's that has n't gone quite as she 'd hoped though			1
her marriage to multi-millionaire businessman @entity85 , 54 , with whom she had a son , @entity86 , eight , lasted just two years			0
they split when she was 30			0
she describes the process of coming out of the union - which she ended - as difficult , along with adjusting to single life			1
' it was quite hard and i had to change a lot of the people that i went out with because when i was married it was always couples , ' she said			0
' i needed to find myself again and almost change my friends because i was n't going to dinner parties any more , i was n't going on couple weekends away			2
it was a whole life changing experience for me			0
' i lost myself and i needed to find myself			0
i 'd been with someone since the age of 18 and i did n't know who i was			2
' by the time you get to 30 you change massively as a woman and who you are and what you want and you evolve			0
' in a shot from the show @entity4 drinks champagne in the bath showing off her lavish @entity5 lifestyle two years on and @entity4 is more settled , she has a successful beauty business which has been open for just over a year and she 's just started a second building business			1
she and @entity85 are close and he 's even appeared alongside her on the show			0
@entity4 does admit there have been moments where she has doubted whether she made the right decision to end it , but she 's proud the pair have remained friends			1
she says : ' it 's really important because at the end of the day once upon a time we did love each other and , as much as that relationship has changed and we 're no longer intimate , i do n't think the love ever really dies			2
' there 's always going to be that love for one another and because we 've got a child it 's logical that we get on so that @entity86 does n't lose out - the only people that lose out in an acrimonious split are the children and i never wanted that to happen to our son			1
' @entity4 wears a glamorous blue gown , she has revealed to @entity21 that she thinks it is important to maintain her glamorous look at all times @entity4 dotes on @entity86 and revealed that he , like most school - children would , has been revelling in his newfound fame after briefly appearing in the show			1
' he 's always telling his classmates to remember to turn on to the show , even though they 're too young to watch it , ' she said			0
what kind of man it would take to tame @entity4 , who refers to herself as a ' snake ' in the opening credits of @entity152 ? ' i 'd like someone who is loyal and faithful , that 's the number one condition , ' she said			1
' the biggest draw for me would be someone who would love my son and accept my son as well so it was n't just a relationship about him and myself there 's also a third person involved there			2
' likewise , if my future partner had children i would welcome his children into my life as well with open arms			2
' because i 'm a successful businesswoman as well , i 'd like someone who is ambitious and successful like myself because they i would feel that we 're equal			0
' @entity4 revealed she works hard to stay groomed and always wears a full face of make - up if there 's one thing the @entity67 of @entity5 stars are known for it 's their ability to look glamorous at all times			1
even when they 're in the gym these women are rocking big hair , full make - up and only the most stylish of work out gear			2
@entity4 tells us that for her looking super-groomed has always been a priority : ' i 'm a bit of a perfectionist so i like to be well dressed , suited and booted everyday			1
' i 'm presenting myself to the world so i always make sure i have been to the gym , i have a full face of make - up on			2
' i 'm very well presented , i like to make sure that my nails are manicured and my hair 's done			0
' i 'm blessed because that 's the line of work that i 'm in and , having a business that 's open seven days a week , i never have a crisis that something 's not been done			0
' i always keep on top of myself to make sure i 'm maintained and groomed to the best of my ability			0
' @entity4 , who enjoys @entity205 and @entity207 facials says that her favourite brand of make - up is the @entity211 collection started by @entity212			1
she said : ' i love @entity214 brows , we have the range here			0
i invested in the whole thing			0
i fell in love with the colours , i fell in love with the lady who started it			0
' but now she 's on the television , does she feel under pressure to look good all the time ? ' i do n't look at it that i 'm under pressure from other people but i put myself under pressure myself			2
i know at the end of the day i can be the best person i can be and if i do n't keep it up then the only person i 'm letting down is myself			2
' does she want more children in the future ? ' 110 per cent yes , i definitely want to have more children			2
i do n't have dreams of having a huge family but to go through that whole thing again marriage , the engagement and the baby			1
' she 's also in the strange situation of receiving prank calls from ' fans ' , an experience she described as ' quite strange , it 's surreal			0
' she added : ' on one hand it 's nice because they 've watched the show and they want to get to know you and on the other hand it 's quite surreal because i 've gone from being a woman in @entity5 who very few people know to being on a national and very successful show			0
' but would she date a fan ? ' i have n't thought about it , i suppose if i 'd like them i would n't pooh - pooh it , they 'd have to be a bit of a fan or they would n't like me ! '			1
