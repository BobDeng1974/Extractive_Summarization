do n’t get me wrong			1
watching @entity2 on a @entity4 card , in the wee small hours from @entity1 , was a wonderful thing			1
however , @entity7 , full house , local rivalry , and during pub hours … well that was something else entirely			1
sport - on - the - telly fans have been somewhat spoilt for choice for action from the @entity16 ’s headquarters recently			1
@entity18 , you could be forgiven for thinking , with @entity20 ’s parting shot before @entity21			1
not a bit of it , because @entity24 and @entity25 decided they would take their problem with each other outside			1
it was , unfortunately , a double whammy if you wanted to see what the organisers did with the place in 24 hours flat			1
firstly , you ’d have to be someone who has bought into the principle of buying lots of your sport			1
and secondly , you ’d have had to cough up extra to watch it live on @entity41 ’s @entity40 service			1
what a picture ! @entity44 's @entity43 captures @entity7 in all its glory on saturday night winner : @entity24 beat @entity25 with an 8th round knockout in front of 80,000 at @entity7 @entity49 shot : @entity24 landed a massive right hand in the eighth round that knocked the young challenger out all over : the @entity53 looks down on @entity54 after landing the decisive blow as viewers were in for a treat i shall light that particular blue touch paper , and now gracefully retire from it			1
because what is fundamentally important here is that between the channel and the event organisers , they put on a televisual experience that really said to me that the new @entity7 has now arrived			1
those who did n’t go the whole hog and fork out £ 17 for the full night - and i imagine there were plenty of pubs , clubs and front rooms full of people who had all chipped in and did - were given a taste of what was to come for a tantalising 45 minutes on @entity77			1
@entity78 was tasked with being the host for the evening			1
although he is clearly not a super slick live outside broadcast tv anchor , he certainly is a natural performer , with plenty of charm and , of course , tremendous boxing knowledge			1
he was ‘ pitchside ’ for the night on a raised platform alongside @entity86 and @entity87 - whose silver grey suit positively shimmered in the resplendent late afternoon sun. what ’s more , @entity88 also stepped out into the sunlight and promptly delivered a perfectly - timed first - round win - a glimpse of what was to come before the action switched exclusively to @entity96			2
and as the sun started to set , so the scene was being set			2
as @entity100 was going about his business , the stadium began to fill up			2
but , more striking at that point than the sight of an enormous crowd , was the noise			2
there were still plenty of empty seats to be seen , but what could be heard was a hubbub that sounded like a torrent of rushing water			2
it was a maelstrom of excited chatter from tens of thousands of people all getting set for night to fall			2
during the fight , the crowd were shown on the big screens the interview with @entity25 on arrival we were also seeing at home			2
a reaction that commentator @entity124 described as a ‘ mixture ’			0
and he was n’t wrong			0
it was a mixture of loud booing , and really loud booing			0
light show ! @entity24 makes his way to the ring before defeating @entity25 in front of adoring supporters the heat is on : @entity77 and @entity7 put on quite the show in front of millions of viewers at home into the night then , and now we were presented with the full package			1
a stunning overhead shot captured the majesty of the moment			0
the bubbling cauldron that we could see through the roof , with spotlights dancing into the air , and the tiny hotspot of the ring in a sea of bodies			0
while outside , lamp posts and passing traffic gave the impression that the streets were apparently paved with gold			0
mind you , all the action was n’t inside the ring			0
at around ten to 10 , @entity25 was now running late and in danger of missing his bus			0
we saw a backstage shot of a rather flustered @entity77 production assistant nervously explaining on his radio that he was unable to coax @entity165 from his dressing room			0
enter stage right @entity167 who looked all set to go toe to toe with @entity25 himself			0
just as he was about to shout the odds , the door flew open , and out strode @entity25 , looking very much ready for business			0
knows how to put on a show ! @entity177 ' entrance for the bout was spectacular on a @entity180 bus earlier in the evening @entity24 had described the occasion as ‘ proper gladiator days ’			0
and as he stood alone on a small stage , shadow boxing and soaking up the cacophony of sound from a dark abyss of people , the deal was sealed			0
@entity7 burst out of the box			0
and of course it got a fight , and a finish , that justified the build - up - worthy of the occasion itself			0
football is of course what @entity7 is all about , but from what i watched in the corner of my room , this new incarnation of the stadium had just hosted a game of one - a - side that has rubber - stamped it as a sporting stage for something really special .			0

the package was worth the £ 17 charged on @entity40
@entity78 is a natural performer in front of the *camera*
