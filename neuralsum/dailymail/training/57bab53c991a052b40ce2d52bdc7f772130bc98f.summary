click here to see more of our brilliant @entity1 , including @entity4 's heat map @entity5 chose his words carefully given he already has one @entity8 charge relating to referees hanging over his head , but his anger at the officiating following this dramatic draw was clear			1
never one to shy away from emphatic statements , the @entity16 manager claimed @entity19 ’s challenge on @entity20 in the midst of @entity23 ’s goal was tantamount to ‘ assault ’			1
@entity4 scored a late equaliser to hand his side a point against @entity16 at the @entity28 substitute goalkeeper @entity29 dived the right way but was unable to save @entity4 's spot - kick @entity16 captain @entity32 scored from the penalty spot to extend his side 's lead @entity32 placed the ball past @entity37 from the penalty spot to put his side 2 - 0 up @entity40 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 @entity37 6 ; wisdom 6.5 , @entity19 6 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 5.5 ; @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 ; @entity46 6.5 ( @entity47 83 ) , @entity48 5 ( @entity23 46 7.5 ) , @entity49 6 ; @entity4 7 subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 booked : @entity48 , @entity44 , @entity47 goal : @entity23 51 , @entity4 manager : @entity58 7 @entity16 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 @entity20 6 ( @entity29 55 ) ; @entity59 6.5 , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 7 , @entity62 6.5 ; jedinak 7 , @entity63 6.5 ; @entity64 5.5 ( @entity65 64 ) , @entity66 6.5 ( @entity67 73 ) , @entity68 7 ; @entity69 6.5 subs not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , fryers , @entity74 booked : jedinak manager : @entity5 6.5 ref : @entity76 7 mom : @entity23 att : 24,738 goals : hangeland 16 , @entity32 45 @entity78 , who broke his neck in the 1956 fa cup final , got a mention			1
the goal , six minutes after the interval , sliced @entity16 ’s 2 - 0 lead in half to set up a last - gasp equaliser from the penalty spot by @entity4			1
his composed finish , in the third minute of added time , only enhanced his reputation as well as his standing as @entity93 ’s leading marksman in the top - flight			1
seven in the @entity96 now , @entity95 will note			2
@entity5 had no complaints that referee @entity76 pointed to the spot when @entity32 foolishly slid in on @entity23 as he shaped to shoot			1
but he complained that @entity76 had failed to act when @entity19 tripped @entity99 in the area in the first half			2
having accused referee @entity104 of being influenced by @entity106 players last weekend , none of his @entity16 players tried to apply any pressure			2
‘ it ’s a certain penalty , ’ @entity5 said ‘ you ca n’t win			2
we had four or five @entity106 lads surrounding the referee last week and we were told that was wrong			2
i do n’t want my lads to start going silly			0
’ on the @entity20 incident he said : ‘ it ’s just like an assault			0
@entity19 goes for two or three yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face			0
i ’ve not seen one of them since @entity78 , it ’s ridiculous			0
’ that description is exaggerated to say the least but it is true that another referee may have blown for a foul as the players collided following @entity49 ’s corner			0
@entity20 was down for three minutes receiving treatment but wanted to continue			0
@entity5 overruled and dragged his goalkeeper off			0
‘ he ’s telling the physio , “ i ’ll be alright ” and i did n’t want to risk it , ’ @entity5 said			0
‘ once they ’d scored i thought they ’d try the same again			0
the only one to give him some protection was me			0
’ @entity58 believed the incident was no more severe than when bodies came together for @entity16 ’s opening goal in the 16th minute			2
@entity61 headed @entity68 ’s corner into @entity19 , then prodded the rebound in with his right boot			1
‘ i looked at the referee on both occasions and neither time he gave a free - kick , ’ said @entity58			1
‘ there was an awful lot of players flying in at those inswinging corners			0
i thought the contact was after the ball had been headed by @entity23			1
’ berahino put in a hard working display against the @entity40 as seen on the above heat map			1
click here to see more of our @entity1 palace summer signing @entity61 had given his side the lead in the 16th minute @entity16 were awarded a first half penalty when @entity68 was fouled by @entity46 @entity163 miles @entity40 109.6 68.1 @entity49 90 11.7 7.3 @entity43 90 11.3 7.0 @entity45 90 11.3 7.0 @entity16 110.3 68.5 @entity63 90 11.1 6.9 @entity32 90 11.1 6.9 @entity69 90 10.8 6.7 @entity16 built on their lead shortly before the interval when @entity43 slid in desperately on @entity68			1
@entity32 strode forward and sent @entity37 the wrong way			1
in the end a draw seemed fair , certainly once @entity23 arrived at half - time in place of @entity48 to change the complexion of this match			1
it was @entity23 's first goal of the season after recovering from a groin injury and @entity58 felt he played a major part			1
he said : ' there 's no doubt @entity23 made a difference and before the game i thought we might need him			1
having watched @entity16 and looked at their strengths and the way they are able to play i felt @entity23 would be needed at some point			2
' @entity58 admitted , though , he had to get angry with his side after their first - half no show			1
he said : ' they did see another side to me , one which does n't come out very often but has to come out from time to time			2
' i was bitterly disappointed with the first 32 minutes of the game			0
we conceded the penalty on a counter attack but for the first 32 minutes we were awful			0
after that we did what we were supposed to be doing and we eventually got a reward for that			0
' @entity16 , meanwhile , are on the brink of being taken over by @entity206 entrepreneur @entity205 , the owner of the @entity208 and @entity207			0
@entity5 had an opinion on that too			0
‘ if the billionaire is in the background i ’m sure we ’ll be looking for telephone numbers , ’ he said			0
a busy january might beckon			0
