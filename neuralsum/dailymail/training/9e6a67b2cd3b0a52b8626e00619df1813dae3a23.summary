when the @entity3 @entity2 struck down a law wednesday morning that limits @entity3 ' contributions to political candidates , liberals in @entity1 hyperventilated			1
within minutes , far - left sen. @entity7 of @entity8 fired off a terse press release slapping the five justices , all appointees of @entity13 presidents , who joined in a majority to open the floodgates to more money in politics			1
' this in itself is a small step , but another step on the road to ruination , ' said @entity7			1
' it could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it			1
' to equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with " freedom of speech " is totally absurd , ' he @entity45			1
@entity50 , a @entity52 @entity51 , took on the @entity2 directly			1
' the court is utterly ignorant about elections			1
not one of them has ever stood for office , ' @entity50 said during a press conference			1
' they have the enthusiasm of amateurs and think they know what they 're talking about and in fact they 're just dead wrong			0
' the conservative judges ' decision , he lamented , was rooted in a ' lack of humility			1
' in a crowded field of congressional reactions , it 's common for the most outrageous sound bites to be heard most clearly			0
but @entity32 – and one leftward tilting @entity13 – see the decision in ' @entity76 ' as a sequel to the controversial ' @entity79 ' case , and it genuinely seemed to upset them			1
@entity82 sen. @entity81 predicted in a statement ' that as a result of recent @entity2 decisions , there will be scandals involving corrupt public officials and unlimited , anonymous campaign contributions that will force the system to be reformed once again			1
' sen. @entity7 , a @entity8 @entity51 , warned that the @entity2 ruling ' could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it ' his namesake 2002 @entity101 law reformed the use of ' soft money ' in @entity3 politics , a subject on which he has continued to be heard in the twelve years since its passage			1
both the latest decision and ' @entity79 ' overturned long - held limits on money in elections			2
@entity32 politicians have finely honed the art of loudly objecting to the presence of seven - and eight - figure purses weighing in every two years , especially demonizing @entity118 and @entity117 , a brotherly duo of libertarian big spenders			1
senate majority leader @entity120 has been this spring 's most prolific @entity117 - basher , mentioning them by name five times in a four minute speech on tuesday about @entity126 @entity13 ' budget proposal – a document that he claims was written to appease the larger - than - life political donors			0
' it 's a blueprint for a modern ... how would we say this ? @entity117 - topia			0
yes , that 's it , ' @entity120 said on the @entity33 floor			0
' call it whatever you want			0
we might as well call it the @entity117 budget because that 's what they 're doing , protecting the @entity117 brothers			0
' true to form , @entity120 targeted the duo after the @entity2 handed down its decision			2
the ruling , he told reporters , ' take [ s ] away people 's rights ; because , as you know , the @entity117 brothers are trying to buy @entity3			2
' democrats , too , have their billionaire sugar daddies			0
@entity154 has poured hundreds of millions into issue advocacy groups and directly into campaign coffers			0
and @entity157 has put up nearly $ 100 million this year in order to push climate change as part of @entity32 campaign platforms			2
the @entity163 case will please fundraisers on both sides , just in time for november 's midterm congressional elections			0
chief justice @entity169 ( front c ) delivered the opinion for a majority of five jurists , all of whom were appointed by republicans @entity175 : @entity82 sen. @entity81 bucked the trend and joined with @entity32 who were angry at the nation 's top jurists the @entity2 left in place the legal limits on how much an individual can donate to any single candidate			1
but the aggregate limits have been eliminated			0
before wednesday morning , a single donor could contribute a maximum of $ 123,200 to candidates in each two - year election cycle , including no more than $ 48,600 directly to candidates and another $ 74,600 to political action committees and the political parties themselves			2
@entity32 – including president @entity194 's solicitor general @entity193 , who argued the case – worry about a scenario where money could be moved between campaign funds if someone ' maxed out ' all his or her potential giving			2
in all , $ 3.6 million can now be donated every two years			0
that includes the maximum allowed for every @entity126 and @entity33 races , for @entity32 or @entity13 parties in all 50 states , and for the national parties			2
theoretically , either party could conspire to more much of that money into a single high - stakes campaign , effectively busting the new ceiling for a wealthy giver			0
barely a week ago the @entity2 was thrust into the national spotlight , hearing oral arguments in an emotional case centering on whether @entity215 requires employers to pay for health care provisions that offend their religious beliefs but during oral arguments , justice @entity220 was skeptical			2
' what i see are wild hypotheticals that are not obviously plausible and lack certainly any empirical support , ' he told @entity193			0
in the end , chief justice @entity169 had the last word , writing for the majority that ' [ c ] ontributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual 's right to participate in the electoral process through both political expression and political association			1
' ' a restriction on how many candidates and committees an individual may support is hardly a ' modest restraint ' on those rights , ' he added			0
' the government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse			0

@entity32 sen. @entity50 *blasted* the justices , saying they are ' utterly ignorant about elections ' and that they suffer from a ' lack of humility '
sen. @entity7 called the reform a ' step on the road to ruination ' and said it could bring ' the end of any fairness in the political system '
@entity268 left sen. @entity269 carped that the ' shock to our electoral system ' will ' *empower* billionaires to drown out the voices of everyday @entity3 '
sen. @entity276 , another @entity51 , *complained* about ' *reckless* @entity2 decisions ' and ' *gerrymandering* and *draconian* election laws '
