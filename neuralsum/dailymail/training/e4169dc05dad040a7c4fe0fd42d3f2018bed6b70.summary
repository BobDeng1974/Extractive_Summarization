@entity29 strode forward and whipped a pass to @entity72 , who backheeled the ball to a stop on the edge of the area to set up @entity44			0
but he sent his shot high over the bar			0
wednesday responded and could have taken the lead had @entity55 volleyed @entity21 ’s cross on target rather than just wide			2

the £ 800,000 summer signing from @entity140 collected the ball on the wing and with @entity5 ’s defence backtracking advanced into the area before finishing confidently past @entity13			2
it was wednesday ’s first goal in 247 minutes after two games failing to find the net			0
@entity5 pressed for an equaliser and captain @entity36 was denied by a superb block in the six - yard area			2
