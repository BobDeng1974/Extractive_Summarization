by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:25 est , 25 february 2014 prisoners are normally punished for fighting – but one jail in @entity6 does just the opposite			2
@entity8 offers inmates the chance to have their sentences reduced or even be released , by beating outsiders in fights			1
there 's also prize money up for grabs			2
the concept is a twist on @entity20 movie in @entity21 , where prisoners fight each other to entertain the warden			0
the bizarre sense of razzamatazz is heightened by the fighters ’ clothes – they wear special ‘ @entity37 ’ shorts - and the cheerleaders who sometimes parade around			1
the fights are watched by prison officials and huge numbers of inmates			1
brutal : an outside fighter ( left ) takes on an inmate as the referee looks on reward : beating inmates in the bouts gives civilians huge bragging rights many of the prisoners train every day for the battles a boxer warms up before stepping into the ring the fights are presided over by prison officials the incentive for the prisoners is obvious , while @entity70 from @entity71 , who made a film about the fights , explained that winning bouts against prisoners gives foreigners ‘ epic bragging rights ’			1
many of the outside fighters are very experienced , but they ’re often up against inmates who train every single day and it ’s the latter who win most often , according to @entity83			1
' prison fights are done to help the prisoners			0
it lets the prisoners fight so they can earn money , ' said mr. @entity87 , prison fights coordinator			0
‘ they also fight to reduce the time of their sentences			0
to reduce their sentence and to bring honour and fame to @entity6 , if they can defeat foreign fighters and fight a lot			2
some of the fighters are in for drugs , robbery or murder			0
there are boxers doing life or 50 years			0
there are boxers who can never get out			0
’ safety measures : the boxers who have been jailed for very serious crimes , such as murder , are not granted freedom - even if they win lots of fights the @entity37 concept is similar to that of @entity20 movie in @entity21 , where prisoners fight to entertain the warden if prisoners win fights it 's said that it brings honour to their country			1

@entity8 *organises* ' @entity37 ' tournaments
inmates can battle for their freedom or a reduction in their sentence
