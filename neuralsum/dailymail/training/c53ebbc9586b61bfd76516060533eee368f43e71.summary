all he had to do was think intensely about moving his hand and the rest was done by the chip in less than a tenth of a second			1
a team from @entity40 and research firm @entity41 opened up the @entity44 patient ’s skull and inserted the 0.15 - inch chip into his brain to ‘ read ’ his thoughts			1
the information is transmitted via cable to a computer which decodes it and adds commands that would normally come from the spinal column			0
the computer is connected to a sleeve of electrodes on his arm which stimulates the muscle fibres to move			0
