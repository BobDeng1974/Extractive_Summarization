by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:22 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 04:54 est , 6 august 2013 the taxpayer is being saved millions of pounds by a group of internet geeks in jeans , a long way from the buttoned - up formality of mandarins in @entity9			0
@entity10 is the youngest , having walked away from a degree or even a levels to join the government ’s @entity13 aged just 17			1
tasked with dragging the civil service into the 21st century , he aims to make government relevant to a generation more used to smartphones than form - filling			1
web genius : @entity10 was just 17 when he swapped the classroom for life as a civil servant but he is responsible for some of the most popular features on gov.uk the team is based in @entity28 , halfway between @entity9 and the trendy ‘ @entity29 ’ of internet start - ups in @entity31			1
@entity10 is the youngest member of a team of 250 which by 2015 is expected to have saved the taxpayer £ 1.2 billion			1
most of the savings come from mothballing scores of websites for ministries and quangos , to create a single site – www.gov.uk – which becomes a one - stop site for anyone wanting to find out what the government is doing , or access forms , data or advice			1
the site has faced criticism for its over-simplified look , but this year beat the @entity51 and the @entity53 cauldron to win @entity54			0
the chance to work on the mega-site , from its early beta stages , proved too much for @entity58			2
his parents bought their first computer when he was only six and at secondary school he designed websites and taught lessons in @entity65 for other students			2
he later quit college after completing as levels in politics , economics and business studies after his freelance computing work took over			1
he said : ‘ it got to the point where i thought : i 've got to make a call			0
‘ do i want to focus on my studies or do i want to leave college and do other things ? , ’ he told @entity76			2
as a 17 - year - old in a government workplace he was too young to officially go to office parties			1
‘ it was orange juice and do n't tell anybody i 'm here , ’ he added			0
swapping the classroom for the ultra-informal offices of @entity88 meant he could quickly put his theory into practice			0
now 19 , he still lives at home with his parents in @entity93			0
but he is responsible for some of the most popular sections of the site , including an updating calendar on when the next bank holiday is and when the clocks change			1
he has also designed a tool for paying council tax online			2
stripped back : the single government website beat the @entity51 and the @entity103 to win @entity54 in april he could easily get snapped up by internet giants like @entity105 or @entity106			1
but @entity10 insists that part of the appeal is making life easier for the great @entity111 public			1
he said : ‘ it 's very nice to work for your country in a sense			2
the @entity116 is the ultimate @entity111 institution and it 's great to be a part of that			2
" ‘ working for the public sector is great			0
you can actually making user 's lives easier			0
that 's what keeps me coming back to work			0
’ cabinet office minister @entity129 has already met @entity10 , and believes the use of the internet can transform the way the government works – and spends money			1
launching @entity88 ’s new offices , mr @entity129 said : ‘ we are determined to offer world class digital products that meet people ’s needs and offer better value for taxpayers ’ money – and that is why we have set up the @entity88			0
‘ the @entity88 will be the centre for digital government in the @entity111			0
‘ it will transform the way people access government information by using digital technology to deliver services that put the user first and give them the smartest and most cost - effective service possible			0

@entity10 is part of a team dragging government into the 21st century
left college after @entity163 levels to start work aged 17 on gov.uk website
designed popular features , including a bank holiday *checker*
