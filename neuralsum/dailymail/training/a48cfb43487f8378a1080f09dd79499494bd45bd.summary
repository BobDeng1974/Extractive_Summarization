by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 17:07 est , 2 february 2013 crunch time : @entity2 is desperate for a majority of conservatives to back his plans for gay marriage few votes have set @entity9 mp against @entity9 mp as bitterly as this tuesday ’s vote on gay marriage			1
there ’s even dark speculation in the tea rooms that those with skeletons in their cupboard who vote against will find these skeletons tumbling out on to the front pages			1
a growing number of mps are simply refusing to discuss the matter with their colleagues			2
it is a free vote , meaning @entity9 mps are – officially – allowed to vote however they want			1
the @entity27 will comfortably pass through the @entity28 given the vast majority of @entity30 and @entity22 who are in favour of it			1
however , everyone knows that @entity35 would love a majority of @entity9 mps to back it and is desperate to avoid a majority opposing it			1
they are pulling out the stops to try to get this result			2
@entity2 ’s two closest @entity42 allies have been deployed , with @entity43 making the case to the public in this newspaper and @entity47 trying to talk round wavering mps			1
behind the scenes , others are being more direct , arguing that given the pace of change no one who opposes this measure will ever become party leader			2
at the moment , those counting the @entity9 votes for no 10 expect it to be very close			1
they predict 120 for it , 120 against and 60 abstentions			2
only one @entity9 cabinet minister is certain to oppose the measure , the environment secretary @entity63			1
the party leadership expects defence secretary @entity66 and possibly one other secretary of state to abstain			2
however , they are hopeful that the socially conservative former leader @entity69 will come out for gay marriage			2
as someone close to @entity2 says : ‘ the size of this rebellion really does matter			1
’ the vote will be seen as an indicator of @entity9 dissatisfaction with the prime minister			1
one of those set to vote against it says : ‘ it is a good way to show we are fed up without defying the whip			1
’ close race : defence secretary @entity66 , left , is expected to abstain from the vote but @entity69 may come out in favour of gay marriage the number of @entity9 @entity22 in the no camp appears to have risen in line with the mutinous chatter			1
some mps are furious with the leadership for raising this issue			2
one senior opponent of gay marriage complains : ‘ it has split the conservative party and made us all out to be gay - bashers			1
’ so why is @entity2 doing this ? many suggest it is because he wants to demonstrate his 21st century credentials			1
but those who know the prime minister best claim the reason is simpler			0
‘ he really believes it , ’ says one gay colleague , who has discussed the issue with him extensively			0
it is hard to overstate how enthusiastic @entity2 is about marriage			1
even as prime minister , he takes the time to write long , personal letters to friends and staff who are heading down the aisle			0
one divorcee in his circle refers , only half - jokingly , to him as ‘ the marriage police ’			2
a @entity9 in a civil partnership remarks : ‘ if this passes , @entity2 will insist we all get married			1
’ @entity2 and his intellectual ally @entity125 have wanted to back gay marriage since he became leader in 2005			1
so what held them back ? the plan was to introduce it at the same time as marriage tax breaks			2
but this idea has fallen foul of austerity			0
in recent weeks , more than one cabinet minister has urged a revival of this plan			0
no 10 has refused , for fear of looking as if it has been pushed into it by @entity9 concerns over gay marriage			1
this is a major strategic misjudgment			0
for without this something blue , @entity2 will be jilted at the altar on tuesday night by his party when he asks them to vote for something new			1
lost her shine : cabinet minister @entity152 eighteen months ago , @entity152 was one of the government ’s rising stars			0
but since her elevation to the @entity42 , she has lost the confidence of @entity157			0
they believe that if she had not been moved from @entity159 in the autumn reshuffle , she would have been forced to resign over the flawed @entity162 franchising decision			0
aides were also concerned by her refusal to offer @entity165 – her predecessor as international development secretary – official help for a @entity169 appearance to defend @entity154 policy on @entity171			0
with @entity165 on the road to political rehabilitation , there ’s speculation he will return to his old department at the next reshuffle			0
but in the current febrile atmosphere , the prime minister might not want to jettison any cabinet minister – let alone one who used to share an office with @entity183			0
it has been a torrid few days for the @entity185			0
but one thing is cheering up @entity2 ’s foot soldiers : @entity188 is back working for the party			1
@entity188 , the straight - talking @entity190 strategist who steered @entity183 to victory in @entity192 twice and ran the @entity9 general election campaign in 2005 , has been making his presence felt this week			1
last wednesday he addressed the @entity195 and received a desk - banging reception after his declaration that the party did n’t have to choose between securing its base and reaching out to new voters			2
rousing : campaign manager @entity188 has been making his presence felt among @entity185 this week on thursday @entity188 addressed @entity9 special advisers at @entity202 , stressing the importance of ramming home the party ’s message			1
but many in government think that @entity188 ’s discipline is needed not at @entity202 – but inside no 10			0
they complain that , absurdly , the @entity210 is now selecting when individual news announcements should be made			0
there is also frustration at how so many of the policies meant to come out of the mid-term review have yet to be finalised			0
one exasperated source says , ‘ you ca n’t get a decision on anything ’ out of @entity35			0
the @entity185 are trying to move on to an election footing			0
but the campaign machine can only be as good as the policy material it is working with – and that will require no 10 to take some real decisions			0
every february , the same problem comes around for @entity47 : bonuses at the state - owned @entity228			0
inside the @entity230 , there is a sense of resignation			0
one source says ; ‘ it is going to be hot politically but there ’s not much we can do			0
’ some of those close to the chancellor hope that the improving stock market will enable him to start selling off the state ’s 82 per cent stake in @entity228 before too long			2
it would certainly be a bonus for @entity47 if he could avoid another round of controversy in february 2015 , which will be just three months before polling day .			0
