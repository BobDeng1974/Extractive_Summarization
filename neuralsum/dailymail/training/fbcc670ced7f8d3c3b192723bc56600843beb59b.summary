@entity0 dismantled the @entity1 to work out how much each component cost to make			1
the cheapest @entity3 @entity1 costs $ 274 to make , plus a $ 6 manufacturing cost , yet sells for $ 499 in the @entity5 @entity6 launched its @entity1 last month , which is twice as fast as previous models and 20 per cent thinner - yet a new report has now found it ’s also cheaper to make , meaning @entity6 's profit margins just increased			1
@entity11 - based analytics firm @entity0 took the tablet to pieces and worked out how much each individual component would cost to manufacture			2
it discovered the cheapest @entity15 - only @entity1 costs $ 274 to make , based on preliminary results , yet sells for $ 499			1
this is despite the fact the @entity1 is $ 42 cheaper to make than the third - generation model			1
@entity0 ’ @entity20 only looked at the price in dollars			0
if the figures are converted to @entity25 prices this works out at £ 170 production costs compared to a retail price of £ 399			1
elsewhere , the @entity28 with @entity30 costs £ 188 ( $ 304 ) to make , according to preliminary results , and this represents a 6 per cent drop in production price of the @entity1 3 , down from £ 201 ( $ 325 )			1
when the £ 4 ( $ 6 ) manufacturing cost of the @entity1 is added in , the total cost to make the tablets increases to $ 280 ( £ 174 ) for the smaller @entity3 model and $ 310 ( £ 192 ) for the @entity40 device			1
‘ while the @entity1 slims down in size , the profit margins are getting fatter , ’ said @entity41 , senior director , cost benchmarking services for @entity0			0
‘ although the @entity28 ’s new , ultra-thin display and touch screen are more expensive than for the third - generation @entity1 , @entity6 has held the line on cost by taking advantage of price erosion in other areas			2
@entity0 ' @entity20 checked each of the @entity1 's components , pictured			0
the firm only looked at the price in dollars , but if the figures are converted to @entity25 prices this works out at £ 170 production costs compared to a retail price of £ 399			2
this works out at a 135 per cent mark - up			0
‘ furthermore , the @entity1 leverages the same components and suppliers that are used in the @entity65 and 5c as much as possible			0
’ the profitability of the @entity1 rises dramatically as the built - in storage capacity increases			0
for example , the @entity40 model costs @entity6 only £ 5.20 ( $ 8.40 ) more to produce - but has a retail price that ’s £ 80 more in the @entity25 and $ 100 higher in the @entity5 @entity6 was criticised for not dropping the prices of its latest iphones and @entity73 in a bid to appeal to emerging markets			1
this cost breakdown shows that @entity6 is sticking to its traditional pricing strategy			0
this may also be , in part , due to the fact the firm ’s earnings recently fell 9 per cent			0
it was the third consecutive quarter its earnings dropped compared with the previous year			0
@entity5 figures cost to make ( plus $ 6 overall manufacturing cost ) : $ 280 sales price : $ 499 in this instance $ 274 = 100 per cent			1
to find out the relative percentage for the sales price , $ 280 is divided by 100 ( % ) to make 2.8			2
this is essentially equivalent to one per cent			0
if the sales price of $ 499 is divided by 2.8 , it works out at 178 per cent , meaning the mark - up is 78 per cent			2
@entity25 figures @entity0 ’ @entity20 only looked at the price in dollars , so the figures were directly converted to @entity25 prices for components - the sales price is the price available in the @entity102			0
cost to make ( plus £ 4 overall manufacturing cost ) : £ 174 sales price : £ 399 in this instance £ 174 = 100 per cent , so £ 174 is divided by 100 ( % ) to make 1.74			1
if the sales price of £ 399 is divided by 1.74 , it works out at 229 per cent , meaning the mark - up is 129 per cent .			2

*researchers* dismantled the @entity1 to work out costs for each component
@entity3 model worked out at £ 174 ( $ 274 ) to make , yet retails at £ 399 ( $ 499 )
this is £ *26* ( $ 42 ) less than what @entity6 paid to make its @entity1 3
the @entity40 model costs £ 5.20 ( $ 8.40 ) more to make than the smaller model , yet retails for £ 80 extra in the @entity25 and $ 100 extra in the @entity5
