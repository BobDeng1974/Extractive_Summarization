by @entity1 reporter published : 15:59 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 20 november 2013 as the @entity3 continues to deal with the fallout of the @entity7 / @entity6 bullying scandal , a former player has revealed that he , too , was the victim of harassment from teammates as a professional football player - and former @entity12 quarterback @entity11 led the charge			1
former @entity3 offensive lineman @entity14 was teammates with @entity11 for six years in @entity16 - from 2004 to 2009 - and by the end of his time in the @entity16 , he 'd considered suicide after enduring unsubstantiated rumors about his sexuality and constant harassment from @entity11 and others			1
@entity14 currently is married to a woman and has a son , @entity25 ' bullied ' : @entity14 says he contemplated suicide after relentless harassment from teammate @entity11 the harassment was so bad that @entity14 was forced to miss training camp before the 2008 season so he could get professional help to deal with depression			1
' [ @entity11 ] was a big part of it — he was a big part of my issues there			1
bully is a strong word , but he was degrading to me and spread rumors			1
it ’s bothered me that i have n’t really spoken about it , ' @entity14 told syncweekly.com			1
@entity14 says he does n't understand why @entity11 turned against him - after all , as an offensive lineman , it was @entity14 ' job to protect the former @entity48 star from linebackers looking to take his head off			1
@entity14 is n't sure why he was made to be a target , but says it could have to do with a variety of factors - the way he wore his hair ( a mohawk often dyed red or white ) or the @entity59 sneakers he wore , could have contributed to other players ' opinion of him			1
' some guys , they just find one thing and run with it , ' his brother @entity63 - also a former @entity3 lineman - says			2
' @entity68 having a little style and swag , they just ran with that			2
big guys do n’t usually wear @entity59 shoes , but we do			2
they made some comments and snickered about that			2
they may not like it that you dress a little different			2
' ' @entity80 ' : @entity14 comes short of calling @entity11 a bully , but says he was certainly no leader whatever the reason , the relentless harassment drove @entity14 to consider suicide			1
' one time i had a crazy idea of flipping my car			2
i knew i did n’t want to kill myself because i would n’t use a gun			2
i was a coward in that regard			2
because if i flip my vehicle and i ’m paralyzed and i live ... that ’s the kind of stuff that went through my head , ' @entity14 says			1
' i was kind of at my wit ’s end , but i was still afraid to talk to somebody			2
the very first person i opened up to was a paid psychiatrist			0
it was hard to do			0
' after missing training camp , @entity14 asked coach @entity100 if he could address the team as a whole and apologize for his absence			1
' i poured my heart out			0
i ’m not a public speaker , so i was nervous , ' @entity14 says			1
' but i felt it had to be done , so i was standing there talking , and in the middle of talking to them i was making eye contact with as many of the [ players ] as i could			0
so guess who was looking at me rolling his eyeballs ? can you guess who was doing that while i was pouring my heart out to my teammates ? you know how that made me feel ? after that , my thoughts were so screwed up			0
then i started to stutter and thought , ‘ ' these guys probably think i ’m full of sh * t. ’ ' at that point i really cared			0
[ @entity11 ] was rolling his eyes at me the whole time			1
' ' a living hell ' : @entity14 says the @entity12 locker room had little comradery and was full of immature players @entity14 describes the atmosphere in the @entity12 locker room as ' cliquey , ' with @entity11 always needing to be the center of attention			1
' i could be sitting in the players ’ lounge with a group , having some laughs , and he ’d get his say in so the attention can shift , ' @entity14 says			1
' he was the type of person that had everything in the world he could want , but that still was n’t enough			0
he wanted the attention on him			0
there was a whole lot of that behavior			0
he was n’t just that way with me			0
i ’m thinking , '' ‘ every day i strap on my shoulder pads and helmet , i ’m here to protect you			0
’ '' @entity14 also attributes the immaturity of other players to the rumors regarding his sexuality			1
he says he has nothing against homosexuals , but that being labeled one in the @entity3 is dangerous			0
he says that after he caught wind of the rumors , he would wait until other players were out of the shower before he would go in , as to make sure other players did n't think he was there to look at them			1
' if you want to question someone , i ’d see guys in the shower talking face to face , ' @entity14 says			1
' if you want to go further , i ’ve even seen a teammate piss on another teammate			2
they think it ’s funny			0
they are having a conversation and the whole time one guy is peeing on him and the other does n’t even know			0
this is the stuff that goes on , and i am the one having to defend myself			0
there were a lot of immature dudes on the team			0
' class act : @entity14 ( center ) says @entity188 qb @entity187 ( left ) made him feel right at home in the locker room after a series of injuries , @entity14 was released by the @entity12			1
he was picked up by the @entity188 and had a much better experience with quarterback @entity187			0
' we were in the weight room the day after a game , stretching , and @entity187 came up to me and said , ' ‘ @entity14 , thanks for protecting me , ’ ” @entity14 said			1
' that never happened in @entity16			1
i had heard that @entity199 bought his linemen @entity201			0
that ‘ ' thank you ' ’ was my @entity201			0
that meant a lot to me , but the entire organization was like that			0
' i had the time of my life in @entity209			0
i just wished i could have played a few more seasons there			0
