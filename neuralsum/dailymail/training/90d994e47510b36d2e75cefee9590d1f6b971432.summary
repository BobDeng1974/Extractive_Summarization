by @entity1 reporter published : 09:33 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 09:34 est , 30 april 2012 trouble : @entity3 prime minister @entity2 is facing extremely tough times ahead @entity3 today officially entered into a double - dip recession - with experts warning that @entity8 - ordered public sector spending cuts will plunge the eurozone 's fourth largest economy into further turmoil			1
economists also said the cuts , combined with troubles in the banking sector , would delay any return to growth until late this year or beyond after the nation sank into recession for the first quarter			1
it is the second recession in just over two years and comes as the government tries to convince investors it will not need outside aid to pay its bills like other countries caught up in the debt crisis			1
the country is now facing intense pressure from its @entity31 peers to fix public finances , and growing domestic resistance to austerity measures that have helped push unemployment to more than double the @entity8 average			1
ratings agency @entity37 's added to the country 's problems with a two - notch rating downgrade last week and today chopped the credit score of eleven banks			1
while the 0.3 per cent contraction from january to march from the previous quarter was slightly better than the forecast drop of 0.4 per cent , it confirmed the economy is in a tough spot			1
' the wheels are very clearly coming off the economy , ' @entity48 economist @entity47 said			2
' it would n't surprise me to see a very significant decline in gdp both in the second and third quarters this year , and it 's still reasonably easy to envisage gdp to be down about 1.5 per cent this year			0
' @entity3 was last in recession , defined by two straight quarters of economic contraction , at the end of 2009			2
on an annual basis , the economy contracted by 0.4 per cent , compared with growth of 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter , today 's official data showed			1
riots : @entity3 have been taking to the streets to protest against public sector cuts they deem to be unfair and unjustified the government 's latest economic plan , published on friday before it was sent to the @entity70 for approval , forecast a contraction of 1.7 per cent in 2012 turning to 0.2 per cent growth by next year			2
@entity3 bonds showed little reaction to the report but yields have risen to around 6 per cent in recent weeks as investors digest the country 's worsening economic news			1
yields of around 7 per cent are seen as financially unsustainable and have led to @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 seeking bailouts from the @entity8			0
@entity31 markets have remained relatively stable today , despite the news			1
the @entity88 is 0.20 per cent down at 5,737.10 ; @entity90 's @entity89 is 1.18 per cent down at 3,227.75 ; and @entity92 's @entity91 is 0.28 per cent down at 6,782.20			0
the @entity37 downgrades of both the financial institutions and the sovereign put the country 's fragile banking system back into the spotlight , while massive unemployment will remain a drag on already tight public accounts			1
the banks were damaged by the real estate collapse that began in 2008 and now bad loans in other sectors of the economy have risen sharply			1
pain in @entity3 : the nation 's banks have virtually no access to the wholesale debt markets and have taken on a large amount of cheap @entity114 debt they have virtually no access to the wholesale debt markets and have taken on a large amount of cheap @entity114 debt and have bought domestic debt , helping the @entity119 to fulfil half of its gross issuance already this year			1
@entity114 data today showed that @entity3 and @entity124 banks filled their coffers with government bonds last month , confirming that they had helped keep a lid on yields			0
but non-residents , which before december held an average of around 50 per cent of @entity3 's debt , held just 37.5 per cent in march , the @entity119 said			0
the country 's two largest banks @entity134 and @entity135 have suggested they may not buy any more government debt this year , adding to fears the @entity119 may have to pay higher costs to place new debt			2
some investors have been betting the @entity114 will restart its programme of buying bonds of troubled euro zone states to help @entity3 out but some central bank policymakers are fiercely opposed to the idea			0
as well as facing pressure from @entity31 to cut its deficit , there is resistance in @entity3 for the austerity measures needed to achieve this			2
thousands of @entity3 took part in protests yesterday after data showed unemployment at nearly 25 per cent in the first quarter			0
this tallies with a wave of revolt around @entity31 to the austerity measures that have been prescribed by policymakers from @entity31 institutions and from fiscally conservative countries such as @entity92			2
economists , including some from the @entity163 , have started to question whether it is right to push austerity at the expense of restarting growth			0
@entity47 added : ' i assume we get some policy response out of the @entity114 and @entity3 is allowed to rein back on its fiscal austerity it is pushing through			0
' there 's certainly a lot of push back as people question the @entity92 - centric view of the world that everyone needs more austerity			0
' the @entity3 government has announced savings of over € 40billion this year from both central and regional government budgets , to try and cut the deficit to 5.3 per cent of gdp this year from 8.5 per cent of gdp in 2011			0
the conservative government , which took power from the @entity188 in december , has introduced a labour reform and a banking sector reform which forces the banks to raise over € 52billion in capital this year			0
however , with property prices expected by some to fall another 20 - 30 per cent , many economists believe increased banking provisions against potential bad real estate loans will not be enough to stabilise the sector			0
some economists say the country will eventually need a financial bailout package like @entity84 and @entity83 but the government has repeatedly said it will not seek outside help .			2
