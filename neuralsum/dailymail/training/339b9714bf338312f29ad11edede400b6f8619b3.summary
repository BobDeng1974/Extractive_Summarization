seven years ago the idea of a career in @entity20 was completely alien to @entity0 , who grew up in impoverished conditions in @entity22 wanting to play for his beloved @entity23 only to see those hopes — along with his aspirations of playing professional basketball — dashed			1
@entity0 is over the moon to realise one of his childhood dreams and play at @entity2 this weekend @entity11 offensive tackle @entity0 greets @entity32 defensive tackle @entity31 now , after just three seasons in his new sport , he is back home in @entity36 hoping to help the @entity11 kick - start their season with their first victory in front of his mum and daughter , who have never seen @entity0 ( left ) play live before			1
