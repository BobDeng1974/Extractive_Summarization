finally there : farmer @entity8 pictured finally arriving at @entity27 yesterday to begin the excavation of spitfires buried in @entity5 at the end of @entity31 the team : the @entity4 archaeologists , pictured yesterday at @entity27 , will start digging in the next few days and hope to find anything between 36 and 60 planes the 21 - member team will start excavations near the airport in the country ’s largest city , @entity42 , in the next few days			1
at least 36 - and potentially as many as 60 - of the @entity4 fighter planes are believed to have been buried in the @entity5 jungle towards the end of the @entity31 in 1945			1
in 1996 aviation enthusiast mr @entity8 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , was told the rare @entity49 were buried there in crates in august 1945			2
high hopes : aircraft enthusiast @entity8 , 62 , has spent the past 17 years researching and investigating into the case of the missing @entity55 saved for posterity : the historic planes were buried in the @entity5 jungle in august 1945 he subsequently spent two years researching the project , eventually gathering eight eye - witness reports backing up the claims			1
surveys undertaken at one of three sites in @entity5 have indicated the presence of large areas of electrically conductive material around 10 metres beneath the surface of the ground			0
the location matches the eight eye - witness reports collected by mr @entity8 , who has made 16 visits to @entity5 over the years conducting surveys and negotiating with authorities			2
hopeful : @entity8 , pictured in front of a spitfire at the @entity78 in @entity79 , hopes the planes will still be in ' first - class condition ' one of the @entity55 ( pictured : the tail fins ) being crated up in @entity5 in 1945 ready to be buried avengers re-assemble : the team hopes to be able to uncover the @entity86 in a good enough state so that they can be reassembled upon their return to @entity4 ( file photo ) his project reached a landmark junction last year when sanctions blocking the movement of military materials in and out of @entity5 were lifted			1
speaking shortly after arriving at the international airport in @entity42 , mr @entity8 said : ' we are expecting them to be in first - class condition			0
' he believes the excavation project will take about four to six weeks to complete			0
the @entity55 remains @entity4 ’s most famous combat aircraft			0
its reputation was cemented during the @entity103 when the fast - moving single - seater aircraft helped beat back waves of @entity107 bombers			0
@entity4 built a total of about 20,000 spitfires , although the dawn of the jet age at the end of the @entity31 meant that the propeller - driven planes quickly became obsolete			1
searchers hope they are in pristine condition , but @entity117 , a freelance archaeologist who is part of the search team , said it was possible all they might find is a mass of corroded metal and rusty aircraft parts			2
but he added : ' i ’m very confident that we ’ll have answers to the story of what happened ... in 1945			0
' the venture is being backed by the @entity131 videogame company @entity130 , which is best known for its multiplayer titles including @entity133 and @entity134			0
