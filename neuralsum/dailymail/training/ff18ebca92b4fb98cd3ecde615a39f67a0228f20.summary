cervical cancer is an uncommon type of cancer that develops in a woman 's cervix			2
the cervix is the entrance to the womb from the vagina			2
cervical cancer often has no symptoms in its early stages			2
the most common symptom is unusual vaginal bleeding , which can occur after sex , in - between periods or after the menopause			2
over the course of many years , the cells lining the surface of the cervix undergo a series of changes			0
in rare cases , these precancerous cells can become cancerous			0
however , cell changes in the cervix can be detected at a very early stage and treatment can reduce the risk of cervical cancer developing			2
in most cases , the treatment will be : early cervical cancer – surgery to remove some or all of the womb , radiotherapy , or a combination of the two advanced cervical cancer – radiotherapy and / or chemotherapy , although surgery is also sometimes used source : @entity109 ' it sounds weird to say but for me this has been a positive experience			1
