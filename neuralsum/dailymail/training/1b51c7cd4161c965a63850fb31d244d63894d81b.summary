haunting and beautiful , the work of poets such as @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 continues to fascinate almost 100 years after the war began			0
but while @entity4 's vivid images of suffering in the trenches still strike a chord today , not every war poet is remembered quite so well			1
now those poets , among them dashing @entity13 and the gentle , nature - loving @entity14 , are to star in a new book that brings their work back to life			1
dashing : @entity13 ( inset ) wrote into @entity20 , a poem that finally made it into print after his death in 1915 in his new book , @entity26 , historian @entity25 tells the stories of these half - forgotten poets - many of whom offered a take on war that could n't have been more different from the miserablist approach taken by @entity4			1
one who certainly did n't was @entity13 , a glamorous @entity34 - educated sportsman who served in the @entity35 , a cavalry regiment			0
arriving in @entity36 with the first cohort of @entity39 soldiers to go into battle , @entity13 was pleased to be there			0
' @entity36 and @entity43 civilians cheered @entity13 and his men , making him think that the locals were " wonderful " , ' writes @entity25			1
' at first he felt lost in the fog of marching and counter-marching where " only the virtue of the @entity49 faith emerges triumphant "			0
but " it is all the most wonderful fun ; better fun than anyone can imagine			0
i hope it goes on for a long time "			0
' early days : @entity39 troops , @entity13 among them , were cheered by civilians when they first arrived hard : despite the setbacks of @entity59 ( pictured ) and the @entity60 , @entity13 never lost his taste for fighting the flowers left thick at nightfall in the wood this @entity65 call into mind the men , now far from home , who , with their sweethearts , should have gathered them and will do never again			1
he later wrote that he ' adored war ' , describing it as a ' big picnic but without the objectiveness of a picnic '			0
but letters were n't all that he was writing			0
while serving in the @entity79 during the battles of the @entity81 , @entity59 and @entity82 , @entity13 was also writing poetry			2
unsurprisingly , @entity13 's work glories in the dirty business of fighting , describing the exhilaration of streaming over the top of the trenches and running at the @entity92 lines			2
his most famous work , @entity93 , was even published in the @entity94 the year it was written			1
sadly for @entity13 , however , he was n't alive to see it			0
fighting in the second battle of @entity82 , he was hit in the head by a splinter from a shell and died of his wounds 13 days later			1
he was just 27 years old			0
gentle : @entity14 was 39 when he was killed at @entity101 while serving with the @entity102 brave : @entity14 signed up after being sent a mocking poem by his friend , @entity106 poet @entity105 unlike the more famous names who would follow him into the annals of poetry as the war continued , @entity13 never became disillusioned with war			1
fellow poet @entity14 , however , never really wanted to be there at all , only signing up after being sent a mocking poem by his friend , the @entity106 poet @entity105			1
@entity14 , a grammar - school educated writer , could n't have been more different from the aristocratic @entity13			1
a gentle man with a passion for nature , he spent most of his life in the @entity121 , then @entity123 countryside , where he lived with his wife @entity124 and three children			2
when war broke out , @entity14 , then aged 36 , could have avoided the draft but eventually joined the @entity102 in november 1916			1
by early 1917 , @entity14 was in @entity36 and serving with his unit near @entity101			1
while he was there , he composed his heartbreaking piece , in @entity131 , a four - line poem that movingly decried the loss of millions of young men			2
sadly , @entity14 would become one of them			2
on the 9th april 1917 , he was killed by the concussive blast of one of the last shells fired during the @entity139			0
he was just 39 years old			0
some desperate glory : the @entity141 the poets knew by @entity25 , Â£ 20 , is published by @entity143			2

@entity145 was 27 when he died fighting near @entity82
his most famous work , @entity93 , *appeared* in the *papers* *shortly* after
another little - remembered poet is the gentle , nature - loving @entity14
@entity14 , who was *38* when he joined up , was killed at the battle of @entity101
both men appear in a new book written by historian @entity25
