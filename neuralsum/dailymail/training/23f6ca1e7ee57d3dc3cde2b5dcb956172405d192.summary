although @entity1 has n’t revealed when its fresh service will be rolled out globally , @entity1 's @entity152 vice president @entity151 said in february : ‘ we do n’t publish forward strategy plans but history would suggest that once we roll out something across @entity158 , typically that leads to international expansion			1

the @entity139 tool complements @entity1 's @entity172 app that launched in february			0

it also lets users scan and dial phone numbers of launch websites from magazines , adverts or posters			0
