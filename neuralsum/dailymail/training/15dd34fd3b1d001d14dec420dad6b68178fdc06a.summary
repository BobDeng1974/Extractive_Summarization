but @entity1 's family refused to accept the prognosis and eventually won an injunction preventing the hospital from switching off the ventilator , and transferred the teen to a undisclosed facility in @entity8 willing to keep her alive			1
now they 're petitioning the court to reverse the death certificate , using the videos as evidence of @entity1 's life			2
