a singing doctor has been handed £ 8,000 of taxpayers ' money to make a music video in which he tells people how to use their inhalers			1
dr @entity13 , who is based at @entity14 , was praised two years ago for his home - made video , ' breakfast at @entity9 ' - a take on @entity12 's breakfast at @entity7 - in which explained guidelines for treating asthma patients			1
he has now been given a @entity20 grant to pay for a professional film crew to create a new video to help asthma patients use their inhalers properly			1
but the @entity24 has labelled the grant ' nonsense ' , claiming that the funds could be put to better use at a time when the @entity20 is facing budget freezes			1
he is pictured in a previous video he funded himself dr @entity13 , 33 , is keeping details of the new song under wraps until it is broadcast next year			2
he said : ' the aim will be to help educate people about when and how to use inhalers			0
' if it helps to change people 's behaviour it could lead to fewer hospital admissions and the cost of the project could easily be recovered			1
' research shows that there is a lack of awareness among people as to when and how to use their inhaler			0
' the next logical step , having made a video aimed at staff was to create a video to show patients how to manage their condition			0
' for his previous video , dr @entity13 used his mobile phone , a home computer and help from this friends to create what became a @entity69 hit			0
the grant was awarded after dr @entity13 was praised for creating a @entity69 video about asthma guidelines the doctor insists the video could cut the number of people going to their doctors or hospital and so will recoup the funding invested in it he took the lyrics from @entity81 by @entity12 and turned it into breakfast at @entity9 , the name of a @entity14 hospital , to explain the guidelines medics should follow in treating asthma patients			1
the video won the @entity89 in @entity90 2012 and the @entity91 2013			0
although the stars of his new video are all staff at @entity14 's hospitals , a professional film crew has been hired to shoot it			1
the project was one of only 46 out of a total of 600 applications which received a share of a £ 2.5million @entity103 fund to improve care			0
dr @entity13 said : ' this video is a little more serious and while i want it to include humour i do n't want to offend anyone and i do n't want the video to be patronising			0
' we are aiming for hundreds of thousands of views			0
the last video showed me there was an appetite for this sort of thing			0
' the doctor won two awards for his previous video , which he made with his mobile phone and home computer a scene from dr @entity13 's previous video			2
campaigners have hit out at the funding of his latest project @entity128 , chief executive of @entity103 , said : ' once again frontline clinicians and @entity20 managers are proving that , given the chance , the @entity20 can be one of the most innovative health services in the world			2
' but @entity135 , campaign manager for the @entity24 , said : ' taxpayers will be baffled that , with finances so tight , the @entity20 is dishing out recording contracts to its own staff			2
' while dr @entity13 may well have a delightful singing voice , it 's nonsense to prioritise a grant like this when front - line staff are feeling the pinch of a necessary pay - freeze			2
' the @entity20 must cut out this kind of waste , as well as removing layers of middle - management and unnecessary bureaucracy , if it is to remain sustainable as our population ages			1

doctor was praised for making self - funded asthma guidelines music video
now he 's been given £ 8,000 of taxpayers ' money to produce another
he insists film will cut hospital admissions and so save @entity20 money
campaigners say it 's a waste of cash at a time of *straitened* budgets
