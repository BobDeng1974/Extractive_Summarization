early discoverers : the @entity0 may have known as early as august 2007 that the setting of global benchmark interest rates was flawed the @entity0 may have known as early as august 2007 that the setting of global benchmark interest rates was flawed			2
following an inquiry with @entity5 banking group @entity4 in the spring of 2008 , it shared proposals for reform of the system with @entity5 authorities			1
the role of the @entity0 is likely to raise questions about whether it and other authorities took enough action to address concerns they had about the way @entity19 rates were set , or whether their struggle to keep the banking system afloat through the financial crisis meant the issue took a backseat			1
a @entity0 spokesperson said in a statement that ' in the context of our market monitoring following the onset of the financial crisis in late 2007 , involving thousands of calls and emails with market participants over a period of many months , we received occasional anecdotal reports from @entity4 of problems with @entity19			1
' ' in the spring of 2008 , following the failure of @entity38 and shortly before the first media report on the subject , we made further inquiry of @entity4 as to how @entity19 submissions were being conducted			1
we subsequently shared our analysis and suggestions for reform of @entity19 with the relevant authorities in the @entity5			1
' the @entity0 statement did not provide the precise timing of the communication with the @entity5 authorities			1
@entity38 collapsed in early march 2008 and was then acquired by @entity51			0
meanwhile , legislators on @entity53 have signaled they are interested in learning more about what @entity0 officials knew with regards to allegations of @entity19 manipulation			1
on july 9 , represenative @entity59 , chairman of a subcommittee of the @entity62 , sent a letter to the @entity0 asking for transcripts of any ' communications with @entity4 regarding the setting of interbank offered rates from august 2007 to november 2008			1
' in the letter , a copy of which was reviewed by @entity74 , the @entity70 @entity69 asked @entity0 president @entity75 to provide the transcripts by friday			0
@entity77 , who chairs the @entity78 , said on tuesday he was concerned by the allegations of the potential ' widespread manipulation ' of @entity19 and had directed his staff to schedule briefings on the issue			0
dependent : the rates set by @entity19 are an integral part of the world financial system , including the @entity87 ( pictured ) , and are used to price some $ 550trillion in loans , securities and derivatives @entity77 also said the committee planned to ask treasury secretary @entity92 and @entity94 chairman @entity93 about the allegations at hearings later this month			1
@entity4 last month agreed to pay $ 453million to @entity5 and @entity98 authorities to settle allegations that it manipulated @entity19 , a series of rates set daily by a group of international banks in @entity104 across various currencies			1
the rates are an integral part of the world financial system and have an impact on borrowing costs for many people and companies as they are used to price some $ 550trillion in loans , securities and derivatives			0
by manipulating @entity19 , banks could have made profits or avoided losses by wagering on the direction of interest rates			0
during the enormous liquidity problems in the financial crisis they could , by reporting lower than actual borrowing costs , have signaled that they were in better financial health than they really were			0
powerful player : @entity92 served as the chairman of the @entity94 before he was promoted to his current position as the @entity130 so far , the scandal has been more of a @entity5 affair , prompting the resignation of @entity4 top three executives , condemnation from the @entity5 government amid a public outcry , and questions about the lack of oversight from @entity5 regulators			1
the @entity143 's deputy governor @entity142 on monday even had to deny suggestions that government ministers had pressured him to encourage banks to manipulate @entity19			2
but the deepening investigation by regulators in @entity5 , the @entity98 , and other countries is expected to uncover problems well beyond @entity4 and @entity5 banks			1
more than a dozen banks are being investigated for their roles in setting @entity19 , including @entity154 , @entity51 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			0
. regulators , including the @entity0 , had a responsibility ' to force greater integrity and cooperation , ' and it had clearly reviewed the situation and had the resources to investigate , said @entity165 , an associate research scholar at @entity166 , who has written about @entity19			1
' obviously they considered this to be within their orbit			0
' many of the requests for improper @entity19 submissions came from traders in @entity175			0
as one of the world 's most powerful regulators , the @entity0 has the power to ' jawbone ' banks to force them to make tough decisions , said @entity183 , former associate general counsel at the @entity94 in @entity184 and now a lawyer at @entity184 law firm @entity186			0
still , he said by the autumn of 2008 , the @entity0 's focus was locked on the impact of the meltdown of @entity191 and @entity192 as it sought to prevent a global economic disaster			2
@entity4 said in documents released last tuesday that it first contacted @entity0 officials to discuss @entity19 on august 28 , 2007 , at a time when credit problems arising from the @entity98 housing bust were beginning to mount			1
it communicated with the @entity0 twice that day			0
between then and october 2008 , it communicated another 10 times with the @entity98 central bank about @entity19 submissions , including @entity19 - related problems during the financial crisis , according to the documents			1
in its document listing those meetings as well as ones with @entity5 authorities , @entity4 said : ' we believe that this chronology shows clearly that our people repeatedly raised with regulators concerns arising from the impact of the credit crisis on libor setting over an extended period			1
' as a bank doing business in the @entity98 , @entity4 @entity98 operations would have come under the @entity0 's purview			1
this would have been even more the case after it acquired the investment banking and trading operations of the bankrupt @entity191 in september 2008			0
under fire : @entity4 has had billions wiped off its shares since it was rocked by the @entity19 - fixing allegations officials with the @entity0 talked to authorities in @entity5 about problems with the calculation of @entity19 and also heard from market participants about whether an alternative could be found for @entity19 , people familiar with the situation said			1
in early 2008 , questions about whether @entity19 reflected banks ' true borrowing costs became more public			2
the @entity240 published a paper raising the issue in march of that year , and an april 16 story in the @entity244 cast doubts on whether banks were reporting accurate rates			0
@entity4 said it met with @entity0 officials twice in march - april 2008 to discuss @entity19			1
according to the calendar of then @entity0 president , @entity92 , who is now @entity98 treasury secretary , it even held a ' @entity252 ' meeting between 2.30 - 3.00pm on april 28 , 2008			1
at least eight senior @entity0 staffers were invited			0
it is unclear precisely what was discussed at this meeting or who attended			0
among those invited , along with @entity92 , was @entity75 , who was then head of the @entity260 at the @entity0 and who succeeded @entity92 as its president in january 2009			2
also invited was @entity264 , a @entity0 economist who published a report three months later that questioned whether @entity19 was manipulated			2
investigation : now the inquiry is coming stateside as authorities are looking to see what the timeline of warnings was regarding the @entity94 's suspicions about @entity19 problems ' a problem of focusing on the @entity19 is that the banks in the @entity19 panel are suspected to under - report the borrowing costs during the period of recent credit crunch , ' said that report in july 2008 that examined whether a government liquidity facility was helping ease pressure in the interbank lending market			1
when asked for comment , @entity264 directed questions to a @entity0 spokeswoman			2
@entity75 could not be immediately reached for comment			0
to be sure , the @entity0 's reports have sometimes been inconclusive			2
one from last month - only shortly before the @entity4 settlement was announced - found that ' while misreporting by @entity19 - panel banks would cause @entity19 to deviate from other funding measures , our results do not indicate whether or not such misreporting may have occurred			1
' questioning : the former head of @entity4 @entity297 has been summoned to @entity298 over his knowledge of his bank 's role in fixing the rates however , a 2010 draft of a related paper had said that banks appeared to be paying higher rates to borrow from other banks during the financial crisis compared with the levels they reported			0
one step the @entity0 could have taken in 2008 when questions initially were raised was to find a way to get its staff embedded in the @entity19 calculation process , @entity166 's @entity165 said			1
there , they could use the @entity317 - an electronic system through which banks settle interbank loans between one another - as a backstop to measure whether banks were accurately reporting borrowing costs			0
then after the financial crisis had passed , regulators could have helped ' urge on a newer and better system , ' he said			0
the @entity0 was not part of the @entity4 settlement , which was the first major resolution in the @entity19 probe			1
the @entity335 , the @entity98 @entity333 , and the @entity334 in @entity5 , settled with @entity4			2
the scandal has thrown into sharp relief a potential regulatory gap : no single regulator appears to have had ultimate responsibility for making sure rates banks submitted were honest			0
on monday , the @entity143 's @entity142 called the issue of banks improperly submitting rates a ' cesspit			0
' in documents released with the @entity4 settlement , the @entity335 said @entity4 traders on a @entity175 derivatives desk asked another @entity4 desk in @entity104 to manipulate @entity19 to benefit trading positions			2
' for monday we are very long 3m ( three - month ) cash here in @entity175 and would like the setting to be set as low as possible , ' a @entity175 trader emailed in 2006 to a person responsible for setting @entity4 rates			0
@entity359 , a @entity360 finance professor who has followed the @entity19 issue for several years , said that he believed regulators were ' on the case reasonably quickly ' after questions were raised in 2008			2
' it appears that some regulators , at least at the @entity0 , indeed knew there was a problem at that time			0
@entity0 staff have subsequently presented some very good research on the likely level of distortions in @entity19 reporting , ' @entity359 said			2
' i am surprised , however , that the various regulators in the @entity98 and @entity5 took this long to identify and act on the misbehavior			0

questions over whether @entity0 did enough over libor concerns
then - @entity0 chairman @entity92 calendar included ' @entity252 ' meeting in 2008
@entity0 says got anecdotal @entity4 reports of @entity19 problems and shared suggestions for reform with @entity5 authorities
