by @entity1 reporter published : 15:11 est , 20 october 2012 updated : 15:11 est , 20 october 2012 to look at little @entity4 's bright smile you would never think that just four weeks ago her life was hanging in the balance			1
the three year old , from @entity7 , in @entity8 , has been battling a brain tumour which , at one stage , stretched from ear to ear			1
then , just one month ago , when it seemed she ’d beaten the tumour , she was so badly hit by stomach bug @entity17 , it looked like she may not even be around to celebrate her october 8 birthday she shares with her dad @entity19			1
brave smile : three year old @entity4 , from @entity7 , @entity21 , who has battled back from the brink of death twice devastated parents @entity19 and @entity25 could only look on helplessly as doctors at @entity28 ’s @entity27 ( @entity27 ) battled to save their little girl			1
@entity4 ’s latest problems began when , after completing 25 of her 28 chemotherapy doses , she contracted , as a side effect , mucositis - a painful inflammation of the digestive tract			1
encouraged by her progress , her consultant decided to stop the chemotherapy to spare her further pain			0
@entity25 recalls : ' we were on a high			0
we just felt so relieved that " yes , that looks like the end of the cancer			0
" ' thumbs up : the cheeky toddler gives the camera her view on the situation but the very next day , @entity4 ’s temperature rose , so it was back up to the @entity27 again			1
and very quickly , things took a dramatic turn for the worse			0
with her immune system low , the @entity17 - a usually harmless stomach bacteria - had turned life - @entity53 told the @entity54 : ' basically , all the good bacteria had been wiped out by the bad			1
' anyone we asked said it was severe - and we knew severe cases often did n’t make it			2
' @entity4 suffered a prolapse , her lung collapsed and her little body swelled up massively because it was retaining fluid			1
@entity17 produces poisons which cause diarrhoea , and in the worst cases , a potentially fatal infection of the abdomen			2
medics quickly fitted a catheter and put the little girl on morphine , paracetemol and ketamine , but the toddler was still screaming and rolling in pain			0
father @entity19 said : ' you could n’t fit another person into the room - every consultant and doctor was in there			0
' @entity25 said : ' when i heard my mum on the phone to my dad crying , saying he ’d better get himself up , that ’s when it hit home			0
' according to the family even the nurses looking after @entity4 struggled to contain the tears			2
she was placed in intensive care and on a ventilator , where she was sedated for several days ' so her tummy could go to sleep '			0
play time : @entity4 will not let her condition get in the way of her fun doctors administered , for the first time , two types of drugs intravenously , in a move which will benefit other children in the future			2
it worked and before long , @entity4 was out of danger			2
even then the drama was not over			0
condensation in her feeding tube dripped into her lung , prompting another emergency response			0
yet after a four - week hospital stay , just a few days later @entity4 was ready to return home to be reunited with brother @entity118 , 17 , and @entity119 , 13 , and play again with her favourite loved @entity122 characters			1
all end of treatment tests have shown no sign of @entity4 ’s tumour returning			2
she ’s also back on a normal diet			0
her grateful parents now want to spread the word about @entity131 accommodation which meant they could stay with @entity4 in @entity28 during her treatment - and the need to give blood , with @entity4 receiving more than 30 pints .			1

@entity4 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , nearly died four times
almost *killed* by @entity17 - a usually harmless stomach bacteria
