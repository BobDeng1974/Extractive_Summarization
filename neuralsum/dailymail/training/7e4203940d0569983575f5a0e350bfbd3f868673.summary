by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 03:51 est , 13 august 2013 leading supermarkets are selling @entity3 new potatoes that can be up to seven months old			1
an investigation by @entity5 in @entity6 uncovered evidence that the big chains are misleading customers about the freshness of potatoes on sale			2
the findings have led industry body the @entity15 to call on supermarkets to adopt a new definition of what constitutes a @entity3 new potato			1
misleading : a council investigation has found @entity3 new potatoes have often been harvested months before they arrive on supermarket shelves the probe was sparked by customer @entity23 who complained to his local @entity25 office that potatoes on sale as ' new ' potatoes had been stored for prolonged periods after harvesting			1
investigators monitored the sale of ' new ' potatoes from @entity33 , @entity34 , co-op , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 's and @entity40 - between december 2012 and march this year and asked for planting and harvesting information			0
@entity33 and @entity36 did not respond			0
in each of the 24 samples , the potatoes had been harvested four or five months previously			1
one sample from @entity40 had been harvested in august 2012 did not go on sale until march 2013 , but were still described as new			0
council officers were also concerned that the way some loose potatoes were displayed within supermarkets could suggest to customers they had been freshly dug , when that was not the case			0
they passed their concerns to the @entity15 , which confirmed there was not an agreed industry standard description of new potatoes			1
the revised description defines a new potato as a one that has been specially grown and harvested early , packed full of taste , with a thin skin or one you can rub off with a finger			1
call for change : industry campaigners the @entity15 now want all supermarkets to adopt a revised definition of what constitutes a @entity3 new potato leading retailers are now being urged to adopt the new guidelines			1
today , mr @entity23 told of his delight that the potato industry was taking action following his intervention			0
he said : ' i 'm very pleased to be able to say that , following the initial verification that there could be a problem with selling stored potatoes as ' new ' , the council committed to a thorough investigation , which has had a positive outcome and i will follow any developments with interest			0
' @entity87 from the @entity15 added : ' new potato is a term that over-time has become short - hand for a small potato cooked in its skin , often boiled , baked or teamed			1
' to meet demand for quick and tasty potatoes , we have lost the seasonality			0
' our description of a ' new potato ' means customers know they 're enjoying potatoes at their seasonal best and if your supermarket adopts the description , you can be sure of what you 're buying			2
' named and shamed : one sample of @entity40 potatoes had been harvested seven months before they were put on the shelves today , @entity40 said they would abide by the new standard and look at relabelling their @entity111 , @entity112 and new 2.5kg products			2
a spokesman said : ' we are pleased to support the @entity15 's new industry standard description of ' new ' potatoes			2
' new or salad potatoes are popular with our customers all year round			0
we would love to be able to supply freshly lifted new potatoes year - round from @entity3 growers but due to the nature of the growing season , this is n't possible , so we use cold storage to ensure we can always meet customer demand			2
' we will be reviewing the labelling of three of our potato products to be sure we are giving the clearest possible information to our customers in line with the ' new ' definition			0

investigation finds @entity3 new potatoes often harvested months *ago*
campaigners now want supermarkets to adopt revised definition
@entity15 : ' new potato should mean potatoes at their seasonal best '
