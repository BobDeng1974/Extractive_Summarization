by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 18:02 est , 18 august 2013 boys do better than girls in exams such as science because they are better at taking risks , the man in charge of admissions at @entity4 said yesterday			1
@entity10 claimed : ‘ we have generally seen male students tend to be much more prepared to take risks , which is why they do well in exams			1
‘ generally , female students are risk - averse and will tend to take longer to think about an answer			1
if it ’s a multiple - choice question [ boys ] will generally go with their gut feeling			1
girls will try to reason it out			2
’ boys are better at exams than girls because they are ' more prepared ' to take risks , according to the man in charge of admissions at @entity4 he said that what while it depends on the subject discipline , the university had seen male students tend to be much more prepared to take risks , which is why they do well in exams			1
he said boys tended to ' whizz through ' timed multiple choice exams whereas girls may not even finish them			1
admitting he was talking in ‘ broad brush strokes ’ , the director of undergraduate admissions at @entity4 added : ‘ if you are using timed multiple - choice assessments , that has a bearing on the likelihood of the female students even finishing the section			1
’ however , professor @entity45 , a board member of the women in @entity48 campaign and chairman in science engagement at the @entity51 , said his statement was ‘ factually incorrect ’			0
she pointed out that while boys dominated subjects such as physics , girls actually achieve better results across the board			1
she added : ‘ girls are outperforming boys at all subjects			1
they are getting better results than boys even in subjects like physics , which are traditionally seen as a male preserve			2
‘ boys may be following gut feeling , but that is n’t necessarily the way to get the right result			2
’ professor @entity71 agreed that boys did tend to be favoured when more weight was given to exams than coursework			2
‘ if you phrase a question in the context of a story , boys tend to strip away what ’s irrelevant more quickly			0
‘ but , if you ask any teacher , girls are more organised at completing coursework and getting it in on time			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity87 is crying out for more female scientists and engineers because it ’s important not just to have a male perspective , and more needs to be done to tackle the stereotypes in schools that mean teachers are pushing girls away from science subjects			2
’ @entity4 said there were 17,500 applications for 3,200 places at @entity4 this year			0
mr @entity10 said that so much effort was put into selecting students when theyfirst apply that they did not do much during the clearing process			1
thursday ’s a-level results revealed that this year the big winners in the battle of the sexes this year were boys			0
eight per cent of boys achieved the top grade of a compared to 7.4 per cent of girls			1
last year they were separated by just 0.1 per cent			0
boys also narrowed the gap in combined a * and as with a 0.2 per cent improvement to 26 per cent , while girls slipped half a per cent to 26.6 per cent			1
0verall , girls still managed to outperform boys in all subjects except maths , chemistry , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			2
@entity10 , the director of undergraduate admissions , said that female students tend to be risk - averse whereas boys ' go with their gut feeling ' four in five physics exams were sat by boys , an increase of four per cent in a year			1
they also took 60.7 per cent of the maths papers , up 3.9 per cent			0
but girls accounted for 74.3 per cent of psychology entries , a rise of 5.2 per cent , and around seven in ten psychology a-levels			0
experts suggested peer pressure might be deterring candidates from taking exams usually associated with the opposite sex			0
@entity142 is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust			0
end - of - course exams replacing bite - size tests on modular courses is one of the measures being introduced under the @entity151 ’s watch			0
' they only begin to think about it once they ’ve got a string of @entity156 at that level			0
it gives them the confidence to think @entity4 is within their reach			0
' our biggest concern is that the proposed reforms could undo an awful lot of work that has been going on in the higher education sector to encourage students			0

@entity10 is director of undergraduate admissions at the university
he said that female students were risk - averse but boys ' went with gut '
a levels saw 8 **%** of boys get top grade of a * compared to 7.4 **%** of girls
