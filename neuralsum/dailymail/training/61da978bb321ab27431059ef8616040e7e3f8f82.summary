@entity0 would be the first to admit he has gone dangerously close to blowing his career			1
the @entity2 forward had a rather poor attitude and was kicked out of @entity4 — he was even sent out on loan by @entity6			1
‘ i was playing for @entity7 with team - mates who were carpenters and police officers , ’ he says			1
‘ at that stage i did think it was over			2
’ @entity0 's career almost ended before it had began due to his bad attitude and taste for fast food the talented forward turned his life around at @entity17 ( left ) and secured a move to @entity2 he quit football after being released by @entity4 , albeit only for a few months			1
and a minor brush with the law , for celebrating promotion with @entity17 a little too enthusiastically , did not enhance his chances of fulfilling his potential			1
nor did a taste for fast food that saw him balloon in weight			2
yet here he is in the hotel next to @entity2 ’s training ground , slim and athletic and talking as candidly about his past as he does passionately about his future			1
talking in a way that left me thinking he might be the hungriest footballer i ’ve encountered			2
he seems driven by a fear , having already wasted opportunities , of not now making it big			2
when he came up against @entity42 in the @entity43 last month , his biggest game to date , he was awestruck at first			2
‘ i was looking at @entity45 and @entity46 and thinking , “ what ’s someone like me doing on a pitch with players like that ? ” it was unbelievable			2
the 26 - year - old is hungry to succeed after almost wasting his chance to make it in the big time ‘ while you ’re on the pitch you have to concentrate on your job			1
i was marking @entity59 but i kept finding myself watching @entity45			2
i was looking at his positioning and trying to learn what ’s required to get to the top			2
the 26 - year - old was the outstanding player in a match @entity2 won in style			1
his manager , @entity66 , pulled him to one side at the end			2
‘ now do you believe you can play at this level ? ’ he asked			2
@entity66 considers @entity0 , a natural no 10 with two great feet and a burst of pace , as the finest player in the @entity74 , a view endorsed by the recent player - of - the - month award			1
but the journey to this point has been a difficult one			2
@entity0 's path from a tough @entity4 estate to @entity74 star has been a difficult one @entity84 offered him a trial 10 years ago , but he is still waiting to hear how he did			1
some members of his extended family are travellers but he grew up in a council house in a tough neighbourhood in @entity4			1
his parents split when he was two and he ca n’t recall meeting his father , who is now deceased			2
his mother re-married and @entity0 has a lot of time for the long - distance lorry driver who became his stepfather and supported them by doing night shifts			1
but he did struggle with authority figures in football			2
@entity0 was seven when he first started at @entity4 and for two years his older brother would escort him to and from training			1
but from nine , with his brother drawn to the usual teenage distractions , @entity0 commuted alone			1
@entity0 talks to @entity106 's @entity105 near @entity2 's training ground in @entity108 ‘ it was n’t the best part of town to grow up in , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m not saying it was an excuse but you had to look after yourself			2
it was n’t somewhere you ’d necessarily want to bring your kids up			0
i struggled to take criticism from the coaches			0
i ’d take it personally and answer back			0
‘ i did n’t like being told what to do			0
i never did anything terrible			0
i ’ve always been someone who would be first in the training ground and last out but i ’d mess around			0
‘ i would n’t work as hard as i needed to			0
because of the ability i had i did n’t think i needed to			0
but by the time i was 15 , @entity4 — the club i ’d always dreamed of playing for — had let me go			1
’ he ‘ gave up football ’ for a while after that			0
‘ but i then came to realise that football was the best chance i had			0
i was n’t great at school ! ’ he phoned three clubs : @entity6 , @entity135 and @entity136			1
@entity6 offered him a trial and at 16 he made his first - team debut , playing well enough to secure that week - long trial at @entity84			1
@entity0 was awestruck at first while playing during @entity2 's win over @entity42 in the @entity43 ‘ they put me in digs and i did well in a reserve game against @entity144 , ’ he says			1
‘ i remember being at @entity145 and watching the first team train			0
seeing players like @entity148 and thinking , “ this is amazing ”			0
but i went back to @entity6 and never heard a thing			1
’ by the time he was 21 he secured a move to @entity17 and it was @entity154 who finally started to get through to him			1
particularly when it came to his diet			0
‘ he got me right head-wise , ’ he says			0
the two remain friends even if @entity0 was unhappy when @entity154 refused to sell him to @entity160 18 months ago			1
‘ @entity160 were bidding for me during a game and i thought i was about to join a club that had been drawn against @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 in the @entity166 , ’ he says			0
‘ but he would n’t let me go because it was so late in the window , and i accused him of denying me the chance to provide for my family			0
i was sent off in three of the next four games ! ’ and now @entity0 is excited by the prospect of testing himself against star - studded @entity174 he was sent off when @entity2 ’s scouts went to watch him against @entity177 but @entity66 signed him and the @entity178 has also been a hugely positive influence			1
‘ people would see me and think i did n’t even look like a footballer in the past , ’ he says			0
‘ but i ’ve lost a stone and a half since i came to @entity2			1
i ’ve been doing things right for the last two years , eating right , working hard			0
i can still be a joker but i know when it ’s time to work and when it ’s time to have fun			0
’ he is focused on gaining promotion with a @entity2 side top of the championship			1
focused also on another chance to test himself against players he hopes to face regularly			0
it is @entity174 on sunday in the @entity43			0
‘ @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , ’ he says with excitement			0
‘ they ’re my kind of players			0
’ he performed to their level against @entity4 , nearly scoring what would have been a wonderful goal when a startling piece of skill was followed by a shot on the turn that rattled a post			1
‘ i thought , “ that ’s just my luck ” , ’ he says			0
‘ i was up against the best centre half in the world ( @entity215 ) and it would ’ve been great if that had gone in			0
‘ @entity174 is another chance to show what i can do			0
’ and another step , he hopes , towards becoming a @entity222 player and the security he now seeks for his young family : his partner and their two young boys			1
‘ i want to be able to provide a better life for my family , ’ he says			0
‘ and i want to get my mum out of that council house			0

@entity0 was rejected as a teenager by @entity4 and @entity84
the forward was even sent out on loan by @entity6
he *revived* his career with help of @entity17 boss @entity154
@entity0 was sent off when @entity2 scouts went to watch him
the 26 - year - old is now considered the finest player in the championship
