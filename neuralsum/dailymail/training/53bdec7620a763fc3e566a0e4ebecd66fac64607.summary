speaking to the @entity27 , he said that he had a ‘ continuous trajectory ’ for the company and that it was not just about profit			1
he said : ‘ it drives me crazy when people write stuff and assert that we 're doing something because the goal is to make a lot of money ’			1
mr @entity1 added that it was ‘ not like i just decided to get more involved in ads ’ and that it was part of a long process			1
he said : ‘ i needed to because basically the ad product had to be more integrated			0
and that created all these hard decisions that we needed to do well			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s change of mind happened just before @entity6 went public in may last year - a bungled stock market launch which saw one quarter of its share price vanish in a day			1

the social networking site , is accused of monitoring messages and website links sent between users so they can profile what people read online			2
this in turn allows the website , which has 24million @entity154 members , to charge more for the information			0
it is thought the information is particularly valuable because people are more likely to reveal their true interests in messages they think are private			0
