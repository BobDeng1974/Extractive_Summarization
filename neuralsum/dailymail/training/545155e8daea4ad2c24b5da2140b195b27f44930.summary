by @entity0 last updated at 5:15 pm on 1st february 2012 it 'll never stir the passions like a @entity3 and you wo n't see its picture adorning the bedroom wall of the average adolescent teenage boy			0
but the venerable @entity9 has overtaken @entity11 f - series truck to become the best selling vehicle of all time			1
the ultra-reliable , if perhaps rather dull , @entity15 runaround has clocked up global sales of around 37.5 million since it was first rolled out in 1966			1
record breaker : the humble @entity9 has become the world 's best selling car of all time original : a first generation @entity9 from 1966			1
over the past 40 years one has been sold every 40 seconds with its winning recipe of value - for - money , thrifty gas mileage and a huge dealer network , a @entity9 has been sold on average once every 40 seconds for the past 40 years			1
now into its tenth generation corollas are manufactured in @entity15 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
however production in the @entity44 , based in @entity45 , @entity46 , ended in march 2010			0
sales of the car really took off during the 1970s oil crisis as its frugal four cylinder engine offered great mileage , a feature that continues to add to its popularity today			1
it 's success brings to an end an impressive 24 year run by @entity11 's f - series pick - up truck which , with sales of over 35 million , now pulls over into second place			1
in third place is the @entity62 having notched up sales of 27.5 million			2
@entity64 's @entity63 comes in at fourth with 23.5 million sold and @entity11 's @entity65 which has sold 20 million , is in fifth			1
despite only being in eighth place over all in terms of total sales many experts still rate the @entity70 as the most successful car ever			2
nearly 17 million cars were produced between 1908 and 1927 - a period when car ownership was far less widespread than it is today			2
sporting pedigree : corollas won @entity9 the @entity77 in 1999 like the @entity70 the @entity9 succeeds because it is inexpensive to buy , inexpensive to operate , reliable and easy to repair			0
early corollas were rear - wheel drive while later models were mostly front - wheel drive and some models were four - wheel drive			2
the greatest : boxer @entity85 promotes the @entity86 at a press conference in @entity88 in 1980 although always regarded as sensible rather than sporty the @entity9 has had some racing pedigree			0
in 1999 @entity9 entered corollas driven by @entity91 and @entity92 into the @entity93 subsequently winning the manufacturers title			0
despite concerns that the earthquake and @entity98 which hit @entity15 last year would seriously damage production , @entity9 , which is @entity15 's largest vehicle manufacturer , has posted surprisingly upbeat sales predictions for next year			1
the firm lifted its 2012 domestic sales forecast to 1.63 million vehicles , up 6.5 percent from its previous prediction and 36 percent higher than 2011 , after the government last month decided to re-introduce subsidies for fuel - efficient cars			1
it is expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of such green car incentives and subsidies thanks to its broad line - up of hybrid vehicles , including the @entity114 , its cheapest and most fuel - efficient hybrid to date , launched late last month			2
the company 's forecast for 18 percent sales growth overseas was unchanged , bringing the global forecast to 8.58 million vehicles , up 21 percent on the previous year , excluding @entity122 and @entity123			1
that would be a record for the company , whose sales slipped 6 percent to 7.1 million vehicles in 2011 , hampered by the massive earthquake in northeast @entity15 and @entity40 flooding			2
earlier this week on a visit to the @entity133 show president @entity134 hailed the rebound of the @entity44 car industry			0
a @entity138 truck from 1948 ( left ) and a modern @entity138 ( right )			0
the f series was the best selling vehicle for 28 years and remains the best selling truck of all time @entity64 's @entity143 ( left ) and @entity144 ( @entity145 ) are in third and fourth place respectively @entity134 sat inside shiny new plug - in electric hybrids and burly trucks declaring , ' the @entity44 auto industry is back			1
' as @entity150 surged ahead in @entity153 's @entity152 primary , @entity134 emphasised his administration 's rescue of @entity156 and @entity157 from the brink of collapse rival			0
the president told reporters it was ' good to remember the fact that there were some folks who were willing to let this industry die			0
because of folks coming together we are now back at a place where we can compete with any car company in the world			0
' who 's that coming up behind me ? president @entity134 tests a @entity175 during a visit to the @entity177 at the @entity178 in @entity179 yesterday			0

global sales of *37.5million* mean it *replaces* @entity11 's f - series truck as best selling vehicle of all time
