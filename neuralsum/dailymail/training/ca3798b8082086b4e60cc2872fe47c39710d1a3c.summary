snowflakes are understood to be unique - at a molecular level at least			0
but scientists have revealed that each and every one of them can in fact be sorted into 35 general shapes , which in turn tell experts how they formed			1
the shapes , which include column crystals , irregular snow particles and plane crystals - which make ‘ traditional ’ hexagonal snowflakes - vary according to temperature and humidity			1
snowflakes can occur in a huge variety of shapes			0
this infographic shows the basic levels of classification for the 35 shapes , which are then subdivided into 121 categories , decided by researchers at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 @entity28 - based chemistry teacher @entity27 , created an infographic based on recent research to show the different shapes , which he published on his blog , @entity32			1
it shows 39 types of ‘ solid precipitation ’ or snow , including the 35 types of snowflakes and their names , which can be further divided into 121 subtypes			2
simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals , are more common at low humidities , while more complex flakes , such as plane crystals are formed in areas of high humidity			1
simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals , are more common at low humidities , while more complex flakes , such as plane crystals ( a stock image is pictured ) are formed in areas of high humidity ‘ we still do n’t know the precise variables behind the formation of particular shapes , although researchers are continually working on theoretical equations to predict snowflake shapes , ’ mr @entity27 wrote			1
the latest study by researchers at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , splits the classification into three levels : general , intermediate and elementary , with the graphic showing the 39 intermediate categories			2
these are sorted into eight groups : column crystals , plane crystals – which are what many people imagine snowflakes look like – a combination of column and plane crystals , aggregation of snow crystals , rimed snow crystals , germ of ice crystals and irregular particles , one of which looks a little bit like a fern			1
the number of elementary categories used to explain snow crystals has increased from 21 in the early 1930s , to 42 in the 1950s , 80 in the 1960s and now stands at 121 , as of 2013			2
snowflakes are of interest to scientists who not only want to understand their formation , but also wish to find out how crystals could be used in different applications , such as in silicon and semiconductors			1
the study of snowflakes falls within crystallography – the exploration of crystal structures – which allows chemists to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids			0
‘ crystallography works by passing x-rays through the sample , which are then diffracted as they pass through by the atoms contained therein , ’ mr @entity27 explained			0
‘ analysis of the diffraction pattern allows the structure of the solid to be discerned			0
’ the technique was used by @entity113 to photograph the double helix arrangement of dna prior to @entity116 and @entity118 ’s confirmation of its structure			0
last year , a man has created a beautiful video showing how snowflakes flakes grow to form their shapes under a microscope			2
@entity128 video maker @entity126 filmed the formation of hexagonal ice crystals to produce a two minute ‘ microscopic time - lapse '			1
the flakes are created when a water droplet freezes around pollen or a speck of dust in the air , creating an ice crystal			2
@entity128 video maker @entity126 filmed the formation of hexagonal ice crystals to produce a two minute ‘ microscopic time - lapse '			1
this is a still from the video , which shows a water droplet freezing around a speck of dust to create an ice crystal then more water molecules land on the crystal , creating the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways along the ‘ arms ’			0
these ice crystals that make up snowflakes are symmetrical because they reflect the internal order of the crystal ’s water molecules as they arrange themselves in predetermined spaces to form a six - sided snowflake , the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) explained			1
the reason that some flakes have six lines of symmetry is because of the hydrogen bonds in water crystals			0
as the water freezes , bound - together water molecules crystallise into a hexagonal structure so that each point on a hexagon is an oxygen atom with hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom on each side , @entity166 reported			0
as the freezing process continues , more water molecules are added to the microscopic structure , causing it to bloom outwards along its six sides and transforms into what we recognise as a snowflake			0
the precise nature of the shape created depends upon the temperature and the humidity			0
@entity188 , needle - like crystals form at slightly warmer temperatures like - 5 degrees @entity191 , whereas flakes that form in cooler temperatures such as -15 degrees @entity191 are flatter and more circular in shape .			2

@entity28 - based chemistry teacher @entity27 , created an infographic to show the different shapes
they can be divided into eight general categories , or 121 sub categories to show more detail
simpler snowflake shapes , such as germ of ice crystals , are more common at low humidities
more complex flakes , such as hexagonal plane crystals are formed in areas of high humidity
scientists are not exactly sure why particular shapes are created but are working on equations to predict shapes
@entity222 formation could help scientists find how crystals could be used in silicon and semiconductors , for example
