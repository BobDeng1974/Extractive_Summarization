but the former health secretary did not reply and instead instructed an official at the @entity15 ’s ‘ customer service centre ’ to inform him he was ‘ unable to comment ’			1
he is one of 14 babies and two mothers feared to have died at the hospital since 2001 because of neglect – another 30 infants and women suffered serious harm			1

tragedy : @entity55 is held by his sister @entity56 , before he died just days later in @entity9 in 2008 after staff failed to spot and treat an infection bad care : 14 babies and two mothers feared to have died at @entity9 since 2001 because of neglect ¿ another 30 infants and women suffered serious harm and when asked whether it should be published , miss @entity43 , 38 , is alleged to have said : ‘ are you kidding me ? ’ she has since denied making that comment , while @entity68 and mrs @entity40 have both said that they did not intend to cover up the report			1
backed by @entity72 , the families of children who died have demanded a police inquiry			2

mr @entity7 , 35 , said yesterday : ‘ our plea was simply ignored			1

’ mr @entity7 wrote to mr @entity8 after trying in vain to get various other bodies to investigate the tragedy – including the @entity35 and the @entity91			1
cover up : @entity35 executive @entity40 tried to get rid of evidence of blunders the letter read : ‘ in order to save lives in the @entity98 and react more quickly when things go wrong , it is clear to me that the system in place at the moment needs to change			0

’ mr @entity7 last night called for a full police investigation into the cover - up			1
he said : ‘ my view is that the police should now interview these people and carry out an investigation to understand what happened			0

’ earlier this year the @entity131 said it would be carrying out an independent inquiry into the maternity unit – similar to that undertaken at @entity166 hospital , where hundreds died through neglect			1

he vowed that a new system would ensure hospital wards and nursing homes were inspected only by professionals in that field			2
asked if he could guarantee hospitals are safe at the moment , mr @entity200 said : ‘ no i ca n’t and that ’s why we want a new chief inspector of hospitals to come in and give us that expert assessment			0
‘ someone independent who is going around and saying we can trust this hospital , this hospital ’s doing a great job , or no , we ’ve got problems in this one			2
‘ we do n’t have that at the moment and that ’s what we need			0
’ while admitting his words would alarm patients , he said : ‘ i need to tell the truth – we do n’t have a regulatory system and a regulator that ’s doing what the public need			0
