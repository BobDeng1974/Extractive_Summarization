although @entity14 has already removed dozens of the apps , security firm @entity13 warns there could be more out there			1
the researchers say the rogue apps were available in @entity14 's @entity20 - and secretly mined bitcoin in the background researchers say the key signs area rapidly depleting battery and a handset that feels unusually warm			1

download a mobile security app that protects against malware as a first line of defense			2
' your phone is running low on battery and it seems to be working harder than usual			1
would you ever suspect that it was secretly mining @entity39 for someone you do n’t know ? ' it said			2
the firm today revealed it found a piece of mobile malware in @entity44 that quietly uses the phone ’s processing power to create new coins			1
' we call it badlepricon , ' they said			2
' and yes , that is how the malware authors spelled ' leprechaun '			2
' we hope they were going for a clever play on the word ' con			0

security firm @entity13 today revealed it found a piece of mobile malware in @entity44 that quietly uses the phone ¿ s processing power to create new coins			1
however , the researchers say both scams were unlikely to have made hackers much money			0
' a phone ’s computing power does n’t actually result in that many coins , ' they said			0
' the difficulty for @entity39 is so tough right now that a recent mining experiment using 600 quadcore servers was only able to generate 0.4 @entity39 over one year			0
' because of these difficulty levels , miners often do n’t work alone			0
instead , they work in groups , pooling their processing resources			0
