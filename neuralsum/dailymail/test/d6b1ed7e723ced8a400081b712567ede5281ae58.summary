a virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the @entity2 and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in @entity5 that held nearly 10 percent of the state 's egg - laying chickens			1
poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus			1
but the @entity13 @entity12 said monday that the @entity15 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest @entity5 's @entity17 - prompting a massive bird cull			1

discovery of the bird flu on an @entity5 turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation 's top egg - producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the @entity13 with its breakfast staple the confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country			1
seven other @entity2 states have also been hit by the virus , dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since march			1
the virulent strain in question is the @entity15 , a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn			1
yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply			0
so far , only two egg operations have been hit â€” the one in @entity5 and one in @entity56			1
except for a couple of backyard flocks , all the other cases in the @entity2 have been at commercial turkey farms			1
@entity61 has had 28 turkey farms hit , far more than any other state			1

the country 's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the @entity13 @entity12 precautions : most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out , and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu officials say that 's because @entity61 is the top turkey - producing state , and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl			1
@entity15 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds , backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and @entity94			1
@entity13 @entity12 officials say the virus could be a problem for several years			2
the @entity12 's chief veterinary officer , dr. @entity98 , said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there 's ' very likely ' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter			2
an outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly			2
the government does n't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself , but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution			0
that gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly			0
outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of @entity13 production			2
@entity128 , which owns @entity129 , said monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks			2
@entity65 prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production			0
retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who 'll stock up on stuffing mix , cranberries , sweet potatoes , pies and other traditional favorites			2
however , several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu			1
most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out , and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in			0
other precautions include workers often having to shower on their way in and out , wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots			0
equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized			0
but despite these measures , the system does n't always work			0
according to experts , the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult			2
and if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way			2
farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs			1
less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans , or a flock turning quiet			0
while vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time , this strain is new to @entity192			1
once an infection is confirmed at a farm , all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading			0
these flocks are usually killed by pumping a water - based foam into the barn , following guidelines from the @entity13 @entity12			0
the foam suffocates the birds within minutes			0
if birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died			0
composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds			0
it 's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella			0
the compost is then used as fertilizer .			0

the deadly @entity15 bird flu virus has been found at a farm in northwest @entity5
up to 5.3 million hens must be destroyed in the state to contain outbreak
