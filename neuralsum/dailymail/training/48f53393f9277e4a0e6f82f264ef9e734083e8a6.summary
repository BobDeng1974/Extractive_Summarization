they are the signature style of superheroes but now they are hitting the mainstream - that 's right brace yourself , this summer sees the return of the catsuit			1
@entity8 is well known for sparking a summer trend , just take a look at how well the floral headband took off , but could the latest surge in the famously unflattering skin tight all - in - ones be the craziest yet ? @entity15 and @entity16 are well known for their controversial fashion choices but even the slightly tamer dressed , such as @entity19 were spotted trussed up in these brightly coloured , tight numbers			1
how do you go to the toilet ? @entity15 was spotted in one of @entity24 's bold catsuits at this year 's @entity8 the signature printed @entity26 and bodies are designed by @entity24 who was inspired by her visit to @entity30 's @entity29 and wanted to start a fashion movement with her bold stand - out pieces			1
despite many of us being a tad scared of skin - tight lycra the russian born designer has enjoyed great success and is predicted to continue selling well over the summer			1
@entity24 told the @entity41 that despite her celebrity success she was still aiming higher with @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 being her dream celebrities to dress			2
bold and bright : the usually tamely dressed @entity19 is a fan of the @entity48 ( left ) but @entity16 is no stranger to prints @entity29 fever : actress @entity51 paired her @entity52 with a metallic shirt and fringed jacket it 's true that festival fashion has become less about utility and more about trends with wellies taking a backseat what with @entity15 's white fringed boots and @entity64 's red suede shoes being anything but sensible footwear for a mud bath			2
but there is still something about an all - in - one skin - tight jumpsuit and a muddy festival that does n't quite marry			1
however @entity24 insists that her designs are more than just a fashion statement			2
she told the @entity41 : ' you need to wear something very , very simple ( at a festival ) and something you can easily move around in			2
' our silhouettes are easy to take on and off , are sexy because they are body hugging and backless and have a very funky print			0
as we know @entity8 is pretty messy , rain and mud are easily washed off			0
' catsuits were n't the only unlikely trend to to make a return at @entity8			0
this year 's festival saw the rebound of portable music as an accessory and we are n't talking about @entity92 ! remember the whacky eighties trend of lugging a boombox around on your shoulders ? well the new take is the same idea but with less shoulder cramp			1
@entity15 , @entity100 and @entity101 were all spotted wearing @entity102 at this year 's @entity8			1
it was acceptable in the 80s : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity100 ( right ) were spotted blasting 80s tunes from their @entity106 over the @entity8 weekend @entity15 refused to be parted with hers on day one of the festival and reportedly made her crew join her in a group sing - along to @entity112 's @entity111			1
@entity100 created his own on - the - go party by stealing @entity114 to blair music from the vip bar with pals including @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
his playlist also included some 80s diamonds such as @entity126 , we predict it 's only a matter of time until @entity100 is spotted in rollerblades and leg warmers			0
the brightly coloured straps for the speakers came from a recent fashion collaboration between dr @entity135 and iconic @entity137 fashion designer @entity136 to create a summer accessory for the @entity102			0
to pimp up your pill 80s style and in designer fashion you 'll need to be happy to pay high - end prices with the straps coming in at £ 199			0
if you want to make your @entity143 portable you better be prepared to pay the premium price of £ 199 the @entity143 strap has been designed by @entity137 fashion designer @entity136			0

this year 's festival saw several celebs *sporting* the skin - tight lycra suit
designed by @entity24 they are expected take festivals by storm
the designer says that the suit is extremely *practical* festival wear
