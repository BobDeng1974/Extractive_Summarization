a new type of vaccine has been developed which could provide long - term protection and last a lifetime against all types of influenza a new type of vaccine has been developed which could provide long - term protection and last a lifetime against all types of influenza			1
the ' universal ' vaccine targets part of the virus common to all strains , meaning it could provide a way around the problem of the bug frequently mutating and making preventative treatment ineffective			1
it was created by a team working for @entity21 healthcare company @entity20 using techniques that have also raised hopes of a new generation of vaccines against other diseases			0
the study has been published in the journal @entity29			0
team leader @entity30 said : ' this structure - based vaccine improves the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity , and it provides a foundation for building broader vaccine protection against emerging influenza viruses and other pathogens			1
' @entity39 kills between 250,000 and 500,000 globally per year , according to the @entity40			1
earlier this month experts warned a deadly bird flu virus sweeping through @entity43 had taken the first steps towards becoming a global threat to human populations			1
in the space of one month , the avian strain known as @entity48 spread through all 31 @entity43 provinces and claimed 125 victims , killing a fifth of those infected			0
scientists say it is mutating rapidly and already has two of five genetic changes believed to be necessary for human - to - human transmission			0
currently the virus has made its home in chickens , and only affected people who have had close contact with the birds , often at live markets			2
the @entity20 team 's vaccine is built using protein ' self - assembling nanoparticles ' , which when injected create antibodies that attach themselves to parts of the virus that are common to different strains			1
in lab tests on ferrets , which can suffer the same strains of flu as humans , it was more potent and affected more strains than the current licensed vaccine , the team said			1
an employee wearing a protection suit sprays disinfectant on chickens at a poultry market in @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity43 following an outbreak of a deadly bird fly virus it is also safer to make than standard vaccines , which are produced by growing the virus in a lab. the @entity94 way it is made means similar methods could be used to create vaccines against other diseases			2
scientists gave a cautious welcome to the research , but said trials on humans were needed to see if it worked as well as hoped			0
professor @entity105 , chair in influenza virology at @entity107 , said the research targeted a ' soft underbelly of the virus '			2
' in short this paper takes us a step closer to believing that a universal flu vaccine is possible , by thinking outside of the box in terms of how to synthesise and manufacture flu vaccines , ' she said			2
' what 's more this route could be faster , cheaper and safer than the one we usually use			0
' professor @entity121 , professor of vaccinology at the @entity123 , added : ' there 's no indication as to whether any clinical trials are planned , and since this is a new type of vaccine it might be some time before they could start			0
' so at the moment it 's an interesting development in the lab , with some novel aspects , but definitely not a universal influenza vaccine and it needs to be tested in clinical trials before we get too excited			0
