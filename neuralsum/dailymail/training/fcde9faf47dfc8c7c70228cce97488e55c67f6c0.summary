the obesity crisis in the @entity2 could be solved if they lifted the ban on importing haggis , a leading medic has claimed			1
former surgeon @entity6 claimed 24million @entity2 @entity7 were missing out on the delicacy , which ' satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food @entity2 consume '			2
but ministers warned the best chance of securing agreement to sell haggis in the @entity2 was to get manufacturers to stop including sheep lungs			1
the @entity16 heard claims that the obesity crisis in the @entity2 could be solved if they lifted the ban on importing haggis the consumption of sheep lung , a key ingredient of haggis alongside heart and liver , has been banned in the @entity2 since 1971 and all @entity25 lamb has been banned since 1989 following the @entity27 crisis			1
the haggis market is already said to be worth £ 15million in the @entity25 and supporters argue it could be worth far more in the @entity2 , given the popularity of @entity7 heritage in the country			1
lord @entity6 , a @entity35 peer , said there could be health benefits for the @entity2 if haggis was on the menu			1
the former professor and director of surgery at @entity42 , @entity43 , told peers : ' the @entity2 government is depriving 24 million @entity2 @entity7 of this wholesome food which satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food @entity2 consume			1
lord @entity6 claimed 24million @entity2 @entity7 were missing out on the delicacy , which ' satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food @entity2 consume ' ' this would help to deal with the greatest epidemic they have - the obesity epidemic , which is killing millions , costing billions of dollars and the cure is free			2
' however , @entity56 , a leading fertility doctor and television presenter , hit back , saying that haggis was ' revolting ' but if it could be used to curb obesity it should be promoted in @entity60 first			0
the @entity61 said : ' i confess to being a little bit surprised that one of the most senior qualified medical practitioners in the chamber is asking this question seeing there is a questionable issue about haggis , which i find personally a revolting food			2
' would charity be better at home and if it does really deal with obesity maybe we should be promoting it a little bit in @entity60 ? ' the government hopes the ban on @entity25 lamb can be lifted as part of a @entity82 - @entity2 trade deal currently being negotiated , which is potentially worth more than £ 10bn to the @entity25 economy overall			1
food minister minister @entity84 said there were two obstaclkes to exporting haggis			2
' @entity88 , the @entity2 restrictions on the import of lamb			0
we are working with the @entity2 authorities towards achieving approval to lift those restrictions with i think good prospects , ' he said			0
' secondly the @entity2 's unwillingness to recognise animal lungs as an acceptable food stuff			0
in this regard the most promising avenue in the short term is the production of haggis omitting the inclusion of lung and the @entity7 government recognises this			0
' former environment secretary @entity109 had lobbied the @entity2 authorities during a visit last summer			0
@entity111 of @entity112 urged @entity113 to raise the issue during talks with @entity116 in the @entity117 today			1
@entity111 of @entity112 urged @entity113 to raise the issue during talks with @entity116 in the @entity117 today he demanded that ' this ridiculous ban comes to an end ' , adding : ' if it is not too late , i see that the prime minister is with president @entity116 today , so can my noble friend send an urgent message to make sure that this visit is a triumph by having a private word with the president to make sure that the ban is now lifted ' lord @entity130 replied : ' unfortunately , i can not guarantee a rapid resolution of the problem , but i hope i have made clear that we are working extremely hard towards it			1
promoting food and drink exports more generally is a key government priority			0
' we are working hard to champion @entity25 food and drink overseas with , i think , considerable success			0
' @entity142 mp @entity141 said : ' if @entity144 was around today , no doubt he 'd brand @entity56 a ' sleekit , cow'rin , tim'rous beastie ' for this affront tae a haggis			0
' what 's really revolting is the millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money spent funding the bloated @entity16 year on year which seems to serve little purpose other than to allow unelected peers to insult our national dish			0
