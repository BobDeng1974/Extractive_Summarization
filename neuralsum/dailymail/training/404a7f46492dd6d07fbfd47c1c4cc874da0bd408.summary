by @entity0 published : 09:04 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 18:26 est , 25 november 2013 energy companies are making £ 53 profit from every customer on the back of spiralling prices and a long cold winter			1
industry regulator @entity6 said the amount has soared by an astonishing 76 per cent in a year – from an average of £ 30 in 2011 to the £ 53 figure for 2012			1
the details are included in an official study which also shows that profits from supplying households are up five-fold since 2009 – rising from £ 221million to £ 1.19billion			2
gas and electricity bills for every home and business now make even more profit for energy firms profits on the average bill have risen from £ 8 in 2009 to £ 53 in 2012 , fuelled by a bitterly cold winter the increase will infuriate customers who are struggling to keep warm and cover the cost of other essentials such as food and transport			1
figures published today are expected to show that thousands of elderly died last winter from conditions exacerbated by the cold			0
at the same time , the screw is being tightened further as the ‘ big six ’ energy firms are in the midst of a new round of price hikes			0
@entity37 , the biggest supplier , has just increased its tariffs by 10.4 per cent for electricity and 8.4 per cent on gas – adding around £ 123 a year to bills			1
@entity6 said the company ’s profit margin was some 6.6 per cent in 2012 , which was the highest of the big suppliers and ahead of the 5 per cent claimed by executives			1
looking at the supply of gas to households alone , its profit margin was 11.2 per cent , while the figure for its rival @entity52 was higher still at 11.4 per cent			2
@entity53 , director of energy pressure group @entity54 , said : ‘ the increase in supplier profits contrasts with declining affordability			2
the sector is riding out tough economic times better than its customers			0
‘ energy costs remain a concern for households , and are set to rise further with the costs to make energy supply greener and more secure			1
profits made from every domestic customer soared in just a year to £ 53 , energy watchdog @entity6 said ‘ fuel poverty levels in the @entity69 are extremely high			1
the government ’s @entity70 estimates there are now at least 6.5million households affected			0
‘ more needs to be done to help consumers , ideally with a robust and well - targeted energy efficiency programme			0
’ the @entity6 figures show that the average percentage profit margin per household customer rose from 2.8 per cent in 2011 to 4.3 per cent in 2012			1
the big energy companies insist these figures are reasonable and relatively small when set against the margins made by some other businesses , such as supermarkets			2
@entity6 released this graph showing average profit margins from 2009 to 2012 for all parts of the supply businesses of the @entity87 however , @entity6 revealed that the profit margins made by these same companies on the electricity and gas they both generate and supply is a whopping 20 per cent , which is high by most standards			1
adding the money made from generation to the total for selling power to the public , total profits for the big six suppliers last year were £ 3.7billion			1
the major energy firms – @entity37 , @entity52 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 – claim recent rises in bills are the result of an increase in wholesale energy costs and the government ’s green taxes			2
total profit margins varied markedly between the companies for supplying gas and electricity to homes and businesses in 2012 however , the @entity6 figures show that the increased profit margins has also hit customers in the pocket during what is already a crippling cost of living squeeze			1
an independent study commissioned by @entity6 concludes that the wholesale cost of energy did rise in 2012 , while the firms also faced bigger bills to access the national grid of pipes and cables			1
however , it said : ‘ the profit margin that suppliers on average earned from each consumer also increased , from £ 30 in 2011 to £ 53 in 2012			1
there is some evidence of rising profit margins			0
this rise has been due to a combination of higher prices and volumes rather than lower costs			2
’ campaigners are due to hold protests over rising bills at the offices of @entity37 and @entity102 today			2
the biggest driver of increases in bills was rising wholesale costs , adding £ 75 to the average customer @entity154 , of @entity155 , said : ‘ the big six are lying to us when they say the problem is “ green taxes ”			1
‘ the real problems are the big six ’s profiteering and the rising cost of polluting energy like oil and gas			0
’ energy @entity69 , which speaks for suppliers , said the @entity6 figures were misleading and failed to take account of the billions of pounds being spent on developing new power stations and wind farms			1
it said : ‘ the main reasons customers have seen their household bills go up is because the cost of gas and electricity have gone up as well as other add - ons , such as the social and environmental policies , rising fast			0
’ rising costs : households have seen their energy bills surge over the past decade if you have never switched suppliers , or have n't switched for an extended period of time , then now is the time to do it			2
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
but suppliers tend to charge more for electricity to those customers who live in their ' home ' region - the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly before energy deregulation			0
so switching away will almost always save you money			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0
the simplest and often best way to switch energy bills is to use an online service , which can compare the tariffs on offer for you			0
one way of doing that to find the cheapest energy supplier for you is by using this is @entity221 's fuel bills switching service , powered by @entity223			0
we have chosen @entity223 as our partner because they are a long - standing , well respected firm with evidence to show that they can get our readers the best deal			0

vows to open up market to more competition to drive down costs
bills due to rise by up to 10 *%* this winter as *temperatures* *plummet*
