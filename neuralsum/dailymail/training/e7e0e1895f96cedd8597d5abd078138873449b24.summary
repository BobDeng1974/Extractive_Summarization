by @entity0 a village cricket team has been banned from hitting sixes after an angry neighbour threatened to take the club to court over balls landing in her garden			1
@entity8 , 69 , complained that it was dangerous if the heavy cricket balls fell within the grounds of her detached home which lies at the end of the club ’s grounds			1
now @entity16 in @entity17 has been forced to introduce a ban on batting sixes and has had to spend over £ 4,000 on installing a 50ft high net			1
dispute : @entity8 , 69 , who owns the circled house , threatened to take the club to court dispute : @entity26 , the captain of the cricket team , explained how protecting @entity8 's house from cricket balls has cost the club its savings but yesterday , the club , which has used up all of its financial reserves to meet miss @entity8 ’s demands , discovered that the grandmother has put her £ 850,000 home up for sale			1
chairman of the club , @entity40 , said : ‘ we play on average two games a week for five months a year and have been in the village for over 85 years , in all that time we have not had any complaints other than those from @entity8			1
‘ about two years ago she complained and threatened to take an injunction out to stop the club playing cricket but we managed to come to an amicable decision in january			1
‘ but it means we ’ve had to use up all of our funds , money we had hoped to use to replace our tractor so we can cut our grass and build a new shed as the old one is falling down			0
’ the 61 - year - old businessman added : ‘ we understand she is concerned and a ball has gone over and smashed a pane once before which we covered the cost for but it is odd that she has now put her house on sale			0
‘ either way the net , which unfortunately is a bit of an eyesore because of the great white posts , will prevent any future problems there			0
’ village green : a £ 4,000 net will have to be erected and draped between the three poles at one end of the pitch team captain @entity26 , 30 , added : ‘ cricket is a way for many people to keep fit and socialise , its a shame how one person can ruin that for the others			1
‘ there seems to be a lot of health and safety cases being taken to the extreme across the board and its a bit worrying if that continues in this way			0
’ the club , which has around 30 members with games being played between may and september , is now enforcing a ‘ local rule ’ after consulting the @entity95			2
the new rule means that if a player hits a six , no runs will be allowed to be scored			2
however , residents of the affluent village of @entity102 near @entity103 said that they supported the cricket club and had no reason to be concerned			1
one villager has even donated £ 400 to cover the cost of the net which will be installed on three 50ft posts which the club had made and shipped in from @entity111			2
rules : the club has also instituted a new rule discounting any runs scored from sixes a neighbour , who lives near the grounds but did not want to be named , said : ‘ we all love the club and have never had any problems			1
it is mainly dads and sons from the village who play			0
‘ it is only the odd ball that comes over every now and then , and the club would cover the cost of any damage caused			0
‘ i ca n’t see why such a fuss has been caused , particularly as @entity8 has put her house up for sale			2
it is just a local club and it can not afford paying for all these measures			0
’ another villager added : ‘ the club is part of our community , it puts on events for the village and allows dog walkers to use it grounds			0
‘ it has always been there and she ( @entity8 ) knew it was there when she moved in			0
‘ if you live next door to a cricket pitch what do you expect ? ’ the club initially installed a 15ft high net after first receiving the complaint from @entity161 but balls continued to land in her garden			1
miss @entity8 , whose son is a barrister , has given the club a month to demonstrate that the problem has been solved by the new preventative measures			2
the grandmother , who has lived in her house for eight years , said : ‘ the old net was much lower so the balls came over and made it very dangerous to be in the garden			2
we came to an amicable solution			0
’ mr @entity26 , 30 , said the club , which survives on donations and money from fundraising events , will now have to find funds to buy a £ 3,000 tractor and £ 1,000 to build a new shed for storage from other means .			0
