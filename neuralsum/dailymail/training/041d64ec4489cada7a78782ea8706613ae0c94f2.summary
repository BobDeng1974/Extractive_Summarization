by @entity0 published : 03:24 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 08:02 est , 31 august 2012 television network @entity1 has been attacked for refusing to show the @entity3 opening ceremony live and only showing five - and - a - half hours of the @entity4 in total			1
commentators called the move ' disrespectful , ' as coverage was confined to occasional highlights and daily @entity11 packages			1
fans will be unable to watch any events live , despite the @entity15 team of 223 athletes being the third largest at the @entity4 after @entity17 and @entity18			1
burning curiosity : @entity15 viewers were unable to watch the glittering @entity3 opening ceremony live disappointed fans : @entity1 's coverage of the @entity3 has been confined to highlights shows and daily @entity11 packages the network will wait until september 16 - seven days after the @entity4 end - before screening a 90 - minute special on the @entity3			1
equality campaigners complain that @entity29 athletes are not being treated as the equal of their able - bodied teammates			1
@entity31 , an it consultant in @entity32 who has launched an online campaign calling for better coverage , said : ‘ it ’s a sign of disrespect , especially to those military veterans who are competing			0
attitudes are supposed to have changed since the days of @entity39 , when veterans were ignored			1
what message does this send ? ’ ' the effect on people would be simply amazing and the barriers it would break down between able - bodied @entity15 and the disabled would be monumental , ' added mr @entity31 , whose petition has so far attracted about 1,300 signatures			2
' @entity49 : ' some viewers have started an online petitions and say the move is offensive to the athletes big showing : @entity1 insists its coverage is a major increase on previous years , up from the single 90 - minute programme it offered from the @entity3 disappointed viewers have now started several online petitions in an effort to persuade the network to change their policy			1
@entity63 , from @entity32 , wrote on @entity64 : ' it would be an opportunity for @entity1 to take a big step toward the recognition of physically challenged athletes who have reached the pinnacle of their physical abilities and are competing at a world class level			2
' @entity1 insists its coverage represents a major increase on previous years , up from the single 90 - minute programme it offered from the @entity3			1
it also points out that the @entity75 , and not the network itself , controls broadcast rights to the @entity3			2
the news follows criticism of @entity1 during the @entity81 over not showing key events live			2
instead , it showed them on tape - delay in primetime slots - which still drew in record audiences			2
interrupted : @entity87 and @entity88 of @entity89 perform during the @entity90			0
their performance was delayed until after @entity1 showed an hour - long preview of a new show cut : @entity95 of @entity96 plays at @entity81 closing ceremony			0
the band 's performance was cut for @entity15 viewers even though it made the official song for the @entity81 sports fans were particularly enraged when the 100m men 's sprint - won by @entity105 runner @entity104 - was delayed by nearly six hours for @entity15 audiences			1
@entity1 also spoiled the results of @entity15 swimmer @entity110 's gold medal - winning race when it ran an advert for the today show revealing the outcome before it was telecast that night			0
it caused outrage by cutting a tribute to the victims of the @entity118 2005 terrorist bombings from its opening ceremony coverage , explaining that it was n't tailored for the @entity15 audience			0
during the closing ceremony , it delayed showing @entity89 's performance for an hour - long preview of a new show			0
frustrating : sports fans were also annoyed when @entity1 delayed @entity104 's 100m win by nearly six hours bad start : @entity1 edited out a tribute to the victims of the 2005 bomb attacks in @entity118 in the @entity132 @entity133 was flooded with gripes about @entity1 keeping most day 's marquee events off the air until they can be shown in prime - time , the broadcast that brings in the most viewers and advertising revenue for the network			1
but many of the gripers were apparently still watching anyway and , for some , knowing the results only whetted their appetite to see how the competition played out			0
many of the @entity133 complaints were posted with the hashtag # nbcfails			0
' the # olympics do n't revolve around @entity15 time zone or # @entity1 's prime time			0
air it live @entity1 ! ' one user posted			0
@entity155 , official @entity17 broadcaster of the @entity3 , was slammed for repeatedly cutting from the live action of the @entity3 opening ceremony to ad breaks .			0
