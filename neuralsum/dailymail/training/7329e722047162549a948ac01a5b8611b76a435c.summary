@entity10 , 25 , told @entity11 's @entity12 on benefits and @entity14 he and other @entity15 had come to the @entity16 because it was a ' soft touch ' for scroungers , a court heard			1
but his boasts caught up with him when former soldier @entity19 , 34 , recognised him from the programme after tripping over the busker 's money - filled coat on a street in @entity25			1

' i said " you 're out of order for going on this tv programme and saying you can milk the system "			2
' i admit i raised my voice - but after he started laughing at me			2
' i 'm an ex-soldier - 10 to 12 years ago			1
i was three years in the @entity47 and served with the @entity48 , @entity49 and all races			0
' if he had been an @entity52 , @entity53 or @entity54 i would have had the same feelings towards him			0
' the court heard that @entity19 threw the coat into the gutter in @entity59 , @entity25 , on the morning of april 26 , scattering the cash everywhere			1
he then grabbed @entity29 's accordion and threw it into the road , saying : ' this is @entity52 money for @entity52 people			0
' a crowd quickly gathered , with many puzzled by what was happening because they had not seen the tv programme , the court heard			0
the court heard that @entity19 was grabbed by a girl from a hen party and he then stormed off , yelling : ' i will see you do not busk in @entity25 again			1
' ex-soldier @entity19 , 34 , was found guilty of racially aggravated threatening behaviour @entity29 , who travels the country telling people he lost his legs as a child when he was run over by a train , did not report the incident and did not co-operate with police who investigated after complaints from the public			1
the incident would never have come to police attention if pensioner @entity87 had not reported the matter and a university professor had not taken pictures			2
mr @entity87 overheard @entity19 telling the busker : ' go back where you come from			1

he is milking the system and it winds me up			1
' he is not even from @entity25			0
it costs £ 23 to £ 25 on the train so he must be earning some right money busking			0
' @entity121 , defending , said : ' it was a chance meeting			0
he had seen this programme which was glorifying milking the system			2
' he was annoyed this man was claiming money when he should not have been			0
it was nothing to do with his nationality			0
' but prosecutor @entity131 argued : ' the target of the abuse was a foreign national and therefore it 's a racial incident			2
' @entity19 , of @entity135 , @entity136 , denied racially aggravated threatening behaviour but was found guilty			1
he was given a four - month suspended jail sentence and ordered to pay £ 100 costs and an £ 80 victim surcharge			1
