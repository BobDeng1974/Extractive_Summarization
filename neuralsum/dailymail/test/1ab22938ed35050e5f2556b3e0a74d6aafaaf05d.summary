the little girl who broke millions of hearts after surrendering to a camera she mistook for a gun is now in the clutches of @entity6 , the @entity0 can exclusively reveal			2
four - year - old @entity7 was pictured late last year by photographer @entity8 in @entity10 refugee camp , just 10km from the border with @entity12			2
she , her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the @entity16 camp since @entity7 's father was killed in the 2012 @entity18			1
but two weeks ago , the family took a fateful decision to move south , towards the city of @entity22 - only for it to fall into the hands of @entity6 's brutal @entity16 affiliate at the weekend			1
it means , once more , the family are in danger of becoming victims of a battle between the regime and rebels which has killed 220,000 since 2011 - 10,000 of whom were children			2
pictured : an @entity45 fighter holds his group flag in front of @entity22 's governor building @entity50 law : @entity45 have promised to bring in @entity50 law in the city , and have already started burning things considered banned under @entity55 - like these cigarettes the @entity45 - led rebels is set impose @entity50 law on the city , which is only the second state capital to fall from the grip of president @entity61 's regime			1
' we salute the people of @entity22 and their stand with their sons , the @entity66 , ... and @entity67 willing they will enjoy the justice of sharia , which will preserve their religion and their blood , ' said @entity72 , @entity45 's leader , in a recording released on wednesday			1
this is horrifying news for those living under the @entity45			2
the group group has a reputation for violence which is only rivaled by the horrors seen in @entity81 - controlled territory			0
@entity82 , of the @entity83 , warned : ' @entity45 is an outspoken @entity6 affiliate			1
it espouses a severe interpretation of @entity55 and sharia law			1
' they have been known to execute women who are allegedly running brothels , and stone adulterers			0
it is a violent interpretation of sharia law			1
' indeed , the group appears to be all but following in the footsteps of @entity81 , who have terrified the world with an onslaught of violence , including throwing people from the tops of buildings and getting small children to shoot so - called spies dead			0
worringly , the @entity45 - who reiterated their allegiance to @entity6 in the last month - have said they want to create their own ' islamic state '			1
the group is known for its use of suicide bombers as it tries to achieve its goal , and has claimed responsibility for mass executions , murdered journalists and even priests in the past few years			0
in the days since they took control of @entity22 , there have been reports of two @entity120 men being executed , while the @entity122 - citing local news sources - claimed a @entity124 priest had been kidnapped by jihadists			1
fight : the city fell after a four day battle which saw fighters on both sides lose their lives flee : it is thought about 15,000 people ran from the city as the @entity45 approached trauma : @entity134 reports many of the children were traumatised by what they had seen for a child like @entity7 , who has clearly already been left horribly traumatised by a war which has been raging her entire life , life under the strict sharia law is likely to be nothing be more terrifying			1
but life is no better under the @entity16 regime : indeed , it is @entity61 's fighters who were said to be behind the @entity18 in which she lost her father			2
pro-government militia killed at least 55 people that day , going from house to house , murdering men , women and children			2
it was after this the family fled north , to the camp near the border with @entity12 , which has grown to become a home to 30,000 refugees			0
but despite being so close to the safety of @entity12 , the family appear to have never made it across			0
instead , for reasons unknown to @entity0 's source within the camp , they decided to leave the camp - venturing out into territory which has changed hands between the different rebel factions and the @entity173 numerous times over the last four years			0
the @entity0 's source within the camp said : ' the child does not exist now in the camp			0
they fled to a village in @entity22 about two weeks ago			1
' wherever they have gone , it means the family are trapped once more between three violent sides - none of which are prepared to stop until they have wiped the other off the face of the earth			0
relative safety : many of the 15,000 are headed to refugee camps like @entity10 , near the @entity12 border - but it is not known where @entity7 and her small family are civil war : fighting has been going on @entity7 's entire life , killing 10,000 children since 2011			1
pictured : @entity10 , her home after he father was killed in 2012 and living in an area recently won by one side , does not guarantee survival - or peace			0
a source in the @entity16 military force told @entity209 : ' we have an obligation to liberate the city ... i swear to god the highest we are not scared			2
' @entity215 , director of the @entity216 at @entity217 , was also certain @entity218 would not give up without a fight			0
he told @entity220 : ' @entity61 will likely bomb @entity22 so that its captors find little peace in their new prize			0
' mr @entity82 thinks it is unlikely they will have gone to areas controlled by the @entity16 government			0
one suspects the memory of what they did to her husband will mean @entity7 's mother will keep her family away from @entity61 's forces			1
but villages not in the control of the regime have come under attack since @entity45 's assault on @entity22 - which itself sent 15,000 people fleeing for their lives			1
ironically , many are making their way to the refugee camps in the north - like @entity10 , the safe haven @entity7 has just left			0
and now there are reports of the regime using chlorine - filled bombs against the towns surrounding @entity22 - a new horror for the little girl and her family to contend with			2
one can only imagine how @entity7 , caught in the crossfire in a fight she is too young to understand and so scared already she surrenders to cameras , will respond to any of this .			0

@entity7 and her family are thought to have gone to @entity22 two weeks ago
but @entity22 fell to @entity6 's @entity16 affiliate at weekend after four day battle
@entity45 's leader has now promised to bring in sharia law in the city
already started burning banned items and two @entity120 killed by jihadists
