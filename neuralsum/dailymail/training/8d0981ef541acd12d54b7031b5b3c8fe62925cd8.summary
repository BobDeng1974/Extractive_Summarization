' by the time of the attempted @entity230 robbery , 6 january 2013 , @entity56 , of @entity59 , was in custody			0
they tip over one of the store 's racks of produce to make room for the cable that is attached to their car while one member is trashing the store to make way for a cable , the other decides he is going to manhandle the employee , pulling the employee 's top over his head the thieves attach the cable to the @entity230 before running it back through to their car following the failed robbery @entity61 was linked to the purchase of the car by phone records and @entity60 took delivery of the vehicle			1

all three men have extensive criminal records			0
detective inspector @entity289 from @entity16 police said : ' these were very serious offences committed by offenders who thought nothing of threatening innocent people with weapons including a gun and knives			2
' they were terrifying ordeals for the victims and witnesses involved who , despite the trauma they suffered , co-operated fully with the investigation that brought these men to justice			0
' the significant sentences they have received reflect the seriousness with which the courts treat offences of this nature			0
