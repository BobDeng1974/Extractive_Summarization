the @entity0 has been formally dropped from the 2015 calendar that came as no shock , with the sport 's commercial supremo @entity13 telling reporters in december that the local @entity17 promoters did not want to hold the may 3 race but he had to include it for legal reasons			1

@entity13 recently revealed it was only included on the calendar for contractual reasons the decision to axe it again from what would have been a record 21 - race list leaves a three week gap between @entity42 on april 19 and @entity43 on may 10			1
some @entity45 teams had seen the decision to include the @entity17 race as simply a means of allowing teams to have five engines per car this season and avoid a planned reduction to four			0
