police are using @entity3 stun guns on youngsters every day , disturbing figures have shown			1
officers wielded the 50,000 volt weapons against more than 400 under - 18s in only one year – including some as young as 11 – a huge rise compared with seven years ago , when the potentially deadly devices were first cleared for use on that age group			1
senior police figures are campaigning for @entity3 to be handed to every one of the country ’s 127,000 frontline officers			2
but @entity14 , who as home secretary first authorised the weapons in the @entity17 , said he is concerned that police are rushing to use @entity3 rather than trying to defuse angry confrontations			1
dangerous : records have shown that more than 400 under - 18s were tasered by police in the latest figures speaking to @entity25 , he said : ‘ i think it ’s time for a review that incorporates the use of @entity3 with advice and support on how to deal with difficult situations			1
' for a youngster , 11 years old , a taser is not in my view an appropriate way of dealing with a situation – which clearly must have been out of hand , but where we need to train people to use more traditional alternatives			0
’ mr @entity14 went on to urge chief constables to look at who is authorised to wield tasers and examine ‘ whether alternatives can be used ’			2
according to the latest @entity48 figures , 431 under - 18s had a @entity3 used against them in 2013 , an increase of more than a third compared with the previous year			1
the figures show that they included an 11 - year - old , a 12 - year - old , four 13 - year - olds and 33 14 - year - olds			1
one of the taser shootings took place at a @entity59 school for children with learning difficulties in december 2013			0
police shot three pupils , all aged 14 or 15 , at @entity64 in @entity65 after being called to a ‘ violent incident ’			2
concern : @entity14 , who was home secretary when the weapons were first authorised , has called for a review on the use of @entity3 the age group most likely to face being tasered was 17 - year - olds , with some 180 incidents recorded , followed by 16 - year - olds with 132 incidents			1
the statistics included situations in which @entity3 were fired , used to ‘ light up ’ a target with a red sighting dot or merely removed from their holster			0
tasers were introduced in @entity83 and @entity84 in 2003 in a 12 - month trial for firearms officers in five police forces			2
four years later police were told they could use them on under - 18s , leading to 27 recorded cases in which they were employed			1
in 2008 @entity3 were rolled out across the country , and were no longer limited to specialist officers			0
supporters say the weapons offer a vital tool for police to defuse dangerous confrontations without the use of live ammunition			0
but critics are concerned that @entity3 are being drawn in everyday situations to bully and intimidate members of the public			0
there are also fears that the weapons are being used inappropriately , for example on those already in custody , the mentally ill and the young and vulnerable			0
solicitor @entity109 , who represents people who have been tasered by police , said : ‘ tasers should only be used on children if there is no other feasible way to restrain them			2
’ but @entity118 commander @entity117 said : ‘ if a 14 - year - old is committing a violent act or if they are self - harming , then our job is to make sure that stops in the safest way possible			0
and in certain circumstances @entity3 is that option			0

most recent figures show police used tasers on a total of 431 under - 18s
