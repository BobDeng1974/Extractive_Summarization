a size 28 woman who was a bridesmaid three times is celebrating shedding six stone - and is planning to walk down the aisle as a bride			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , weighed 18 stone 7lbs and had struggled with her weight all her life before dieting to a svelte size 10/12			1
the 24 - year - old , who has been a ' fat bridesmaid ' three times , ditched her diet of crisps for breakfast , pork pies for lunch and frozen pizza for dinner and dropped to 12 stone in less than two years			1
@entity6 , pictured left at her @entity24 's wedding in 2010 , always thought of herself as the ' fat bridesmaid ' however she has now lost six stone and is looking forward to her own wedding and now the @entity27 consultant is just one year away from walking down the aisle for a fourth time - to marry the love of her life @entity31 , 24			1
@entity6 said : ' i have always been bigger - as a child i was always the biggest in my class			1
i just ate rubbish and had a really poor diet			2
i ate a lot of pasties and sausage rolls			0
' i did n't think i 'd ever be different			0
but then in september 2012 my sister asked me to be her bridesmaid and i promised her i would lose weight for her wedding			1
' i wanted to look good for her wedding , but i just kept getting bigger and bigger - i could n't shift the weight			2
@entity6 poses with her fiance @entity31 , the pair are planning to marry next year and @entity6 hopes to wear a size ten dress ' it was n't until that @entity51 when my @entity52 said to me she was shocked at how big i was , that it actually hit home			1
it was a bit of a rude awakening for me			0
' when i lost the weight i actually sent her a card to say thank you			0
' the bridesmaid dress they got for me was a size 28 - i was devastated			2
but in the end i fitted into a size 16 dress and i felt absolutely amazing that day			0
' @entity6 was the bridesmaid for many weddings over the years , by 2013 though ( left ) she had begun to lose weight and wore a size 16 dress for her sister 's wedding @entity6 looks pleased as she holds up a pair of her own shorts			1
she has dropped from a size 22 to a size 10/12 @entity6 , who runs three @entity27 groups , was spurred on to turn her life around after a family member made a comment about how big she had gotten			2
and after her sister asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding - in may 2013 - @entity6 gave it her all and watched as the pounds just seemed to drop off			1
@entity6 joined a local @entity87 and by changing her diet , and going to @entity89 and aqua fit classes at the gym , she shed an amazing five stone in the first year			1
crisps and dip as a snack later lunch : a pasty or pork pie evening meal : frozen pizza or a take away and pints of cider breakfast : yoghurt , oats and fruit lunch : stir fry or a @entity27 healthy fry up evening : homemade chilli or spaghetti bolognese @entity6 was not happy with her size and was spurred on to lose the weight by an aunt who commented that she was ' shocked ' at how big she had become @entity6 and @entity31 lark about with a pair of her old trousers , @entity6 was previously a size 22 and it took her another 12 months to budge the final stone - tipping the scales at a much slimmer 12 stone five pounds before @entity51			1
@entity6 said : ' the weight came off quickly and i just stuck to it			2
and the more weight i lost , the more i wanted to go to the gym as i did n't want to have any loose skin			0
' and now i am just a much healthier person			0
i will go out for a run or take the dog for a long walk			0
i still want to lose a bit more but weight loss is an ongoing journey			0
i still have to work hard at it			0
' and my next goal is my own wedding in the summer - i ca n't wait to walk down the aisle as a size 10 bride			2
' my mum and future mother and sister - in - law are slimming too for it so we are all doing it together			0
it 's great for me to see how my weight loss has had an impact on so many other people			0
