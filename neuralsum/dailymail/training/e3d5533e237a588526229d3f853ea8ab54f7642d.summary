her body is being put back together during a series of major operations - including surgery to smash and re-shape her skull @entity4 , nine , suffers from @entity23 syndrome , has also had metal bars fitted in her neck to hold the rest of her body in place			1

as soon as she arrived she was taken away from me and wrapped up			0

@entity4 had to have each of her fingers and toes separated to give her ten digits and was also born with no knuckles ' her head was really big at the front , her hands and feet were fused like a glove and she just had stumps for big toes			1
' she had a cleft palate and there was even a big bump sticking out at the bottom of her back			0
“ the doctors did n’t even know what was wrong with her - they had to get a specialist in to diagnose her			0
' it ’s a miracle to think how much she has achieved considering how poorly she was as a baby			0
' ' she copes very well , and much better than doctors ever thought she would			0
' but it ’s hard for her - she ca n’t look left and right , and she has no knuckles so it can be difficult for her as a nine - year - old to do the things she wants to do			2
@entity4 before and after her facial reconstruction			2
during the operation , her skull was smashed and re-shaped			0
she also had metal plates inserted into her face , which will help build it up and re-shape it in the first year of her life , she underwent major facial surgery and once attended 27 appointments in a month ' she gets the mickey taken out of her a lot because of her looks , but that ’s just life , and she has learned to deal with it			1
she really is a child that does n’t let anything stop her			2
' many parents give children with @entity38 up for adoption but we knew we had to find a way to get through it			0
' @entity4 , from @entity112 , @entity113 , has a severe form of the condition , which affects one in every 100,000 babies			2

among other anomalies , children with @entity23 syndrome have webbed fingers and toes			2
it affects one in every 100,000 babies			0
she has since had more than a dozen further procedures , including the most recent - a 14 - hour operation at @entity146 ’s @entity145 to lift her sunken face			2
the surgery involved inserting metal plates into @entity4 ’s face before fitting her head with a metal frame			1
this helped to bring the bones in her head forward to transform her appearance			0
her mother said : ' she ’s gone through a lot , including being rushed into surgery to have two metal bars fitted in her neck to secure her head in place so she would n’t become paralysed from the neck down			1
' she was in hospital six days in total and had to be put into a coma for two days after the operation - waking up to a face full of metal is a lot for a nine - year - old to take in			2
' ' during this latest operation @entity4 had metal plates inserted into her face , which will help build it up			1
' wires are attached to the plates and the frame , which we have to manipulate to ensure her face is developing correctly			0
' also unable to use her hands or feet , @entity4 had to have each of her fingers and toes separated to give her ten digits			1
professor @entity184 , who had to travel to @entity185 to learn how to perform some of the procedures at @entity187 , said : ' @entity4 ’s condition is very rare and expertise is necessarily concentrated in our highly specialist units			2
@entity4 will wear the metal frame for the next three months and hopes to return to school in september ' our unit in @entity196 is the only one in the @entity197 to offer microsurgical reconstruction in these cases , which we believe greatly enhances recovery , especially when combined with excellent community support and the kind of attentive loving parents @entity4 has			1
' mrs @entity4 and husband @entity205 , 42 , as well as their older children @entity209 , 18 , and @entity210 , 16 , have had to adapt their lives to look after @entity4 , who has needed a lot of care since birth			0
@entity4 will wear the metal frame for the next three months and hopes to return to school in september			1
mrs @entity4 , who cares for @entity4 full - time , added : ' we are seeing the changes already so there should be a big difference in the next few months			0
' it could take her classmates a while to get used to it as her appearance will change quite drastically , but the main thing @entity4 wants is for people to stop staring at her			1
' she asks why she is how she is , but i just tell her him upstairs wanted to make her special			0
' my broken doll is nearly fixed and i ’m so proud of her			0
