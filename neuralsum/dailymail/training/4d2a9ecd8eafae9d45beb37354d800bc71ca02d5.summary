by @entity0 for @entity1 teenage sprint sensation @entity2 will face his hero @entity3 for the first time at the @entity6 ’s @entity5 tomorrow — but says taking his driving test this week was much more daunting			1
@entity2 , who announced his arrival on the international scene by clinching a 400 metres silver medal at the @entity11 , earned green l - plates after passing his exam			1
he wo n’t be racing behind the wheel any time soon as he still does n’t have his own car , but reaching top speed around a lap of the track at @entity20 ’s @entity19 is his sole focus in any case			1
golden boy : @entity24 ( left ) enjoys his @entity11 400m relay gold medal with team - mate @entity26 hero : @entity2 will face his idol @entity3 tomorrow a personal best of 44.75sec won the 19 - year - old the silver medal behind his friend and mentor @entity26 at the @entity11 in @entity33 — an astonishing improvement of four seconds in 12 months — and he views today ’s @entity36 event as another stepping stone to fulfilling what many believe is his world - class potential			1
@entity40 @entity3 , the reigning world , @entity42 and @entity43 champion , is the figure @entity2 aspires towards and competing against such a calibre of athlete will provide valuable experience			1
he wants to pick up tips from @entity3 , just two years his senior , as well as get his autograph			1
but there will be no trepidation when it comes to racing on a track he has trained on since the age of nine — which is more than can be said for that driving test			1
‘ i ’ve been learning for quite a while , ’ he says			1
‘ a long time , let ’s just say that			2
i ’ve failed a couple of times			2
second place : it was a silver medal for @entity2 in the individual 400m in @entity33 behind @entity67 on the podium : @entity2 collects his silver medal in @entity33 ' i can run in front of thousands of people but in a car i get pretty nervous			1
when i was doing the manoeuvres i was shaking all over the place			2
the left - hand reverse was a bit tricky			2
i do n’t have a car , i ’ve been catching the bus to training			2
‘ @entity3 is the biggest name in the business at the moment			1
i am a huge fan			0
this will be the first time i ’ve raced him			0
me and my friends are always mimicking his interviews			0
‘ on the track i will be in race mode but off the track i ’ll be wanting pictures , autographs			0
i ’ll be going crazy			0
' i ’ve met him before but now i can get a proper talk with him			0
i ’m definitely going to try and pick his brains			0
he ’ s won everything and he ’s only 21			0
i want to do the same as him			0
i do want to beat him			1
‘ i know that track like the back of my hand			0
i have n’t got a time in mind			0
every race is a learning experience , i want to get a bit more consistency			0
