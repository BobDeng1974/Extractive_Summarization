@entity1 buyers are getting much less storage than they pay for because the device is sold full of ' bloatware '			1
bloatware includes apps and files that are added to handsets by the manufacturers and networks before they are sold to customers			2
the @entity1 , which costs around Â£ 550 @entity12 - free , is advertised as having @entity13 of internal storage , yet because or these preinstalled apps , operating system files and network features , this is almost halved to @entity18			1
the @entity1 was launched in march and has already sold 10 million handsets , according to figures from @entity21			2
the @entity22 is a compact version of the @entity1 with many of the same software features			0
its hardware features are more like the @entity27 bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones , tablets , or computers			2
as well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files , bloatware can also slow down your device			2
bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars , desktop widgets or other unwanted additions			0
some of the preinstalled @entity21 files are needed for its new features , such as eye tracking , air gestures and voice commands			1
others , however , are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps , games and the @entity56 and @entity57 hubs			0
to add insult to injury , many of these apps and hubs ca n't be removed			0
it is common practice for phones and tablets to go on sale without the full amount of storage advertised because a certain amount is always taken up by the essential operating system files			1
yet this usually leaves around 70 % to 80 % of storage left , as is the case with the @entity75 7 , for example			0
@entity78 and @entity79 handsets traditionally have 60 % of space left after bloatware and system files are taken into account			1
some of the preinstalled @entity21 files on the @entity1 , pictured , are needed for features such as eye tracking , air gestures and voice commands			2
others , however , are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps , games and the @entity56 and @entity57 hubs			0
many of which ca n't be removed but the worst offenders are @entity21 's @entity97 tablet that is advertised with @entity98 of internal storage , but only has @entity100 free			1
and @entity103 's @entity102 tablets that offer @entity98 , but owners can only use about @entity105			0
@entity21 has responded to the criticisms about the @entity1 's storage capacity			1
although , the reply just states what files are taking up the space , and advises people that a solution to the problem is to buy a microsd card if they want extra storage			1
@entity21 said : ' for the @entity1 16 gb model , approximately 6.85 @entity100 occupies the system part of internal memory , which is 1 gb bigger than that of the @entity27 , in order to provide a high resolution display and more powerful features to our consumers			1
' to offer the ultimate mobile experience to our users , @entity21 provides a microsd slot on @entity1 for extension of memory			0
' the @entity1 went on sale in the @entity133 at the end of april			0
it comes with a microsd card slot , which means owners have the option to increase the storage up to @entity98			0
