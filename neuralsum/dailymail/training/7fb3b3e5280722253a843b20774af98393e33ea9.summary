there was only one realistic bidder - the @entity2 - for @entity3 highlights but there could be a four - way fight for the live rights from 2016 - 17 when the mega offers are tabled next friday			1
there are encouraging signs for the @entity3 that @entity10 are seriously considering joining the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in a super heavyweight tv contest for the next three - year contracts			1
@entity12 and @entity13 are certain bidders , while @entity16 , who own @entity18 , are making the right noises since @entity20 revealed their interest in the rights a fortnight ago			1
now it has emerged that @entity10 have been using @entity24 sports rights specialist @entity23 as a consultant on the @entity3 possibilities			1
the @entity2 will keep @entity3 highlights on its @entity28 programme after @entity29 failed to bid although that is not a firm indication that the @entity33 - based station will bid , it does suggest they are thinking about it			1
having the world ’s richest tv network involved would take the price of the 168 matches bundled in seven packages — already mooted to fetch £ 10million a game — further into the stratosphere			0
if @entity10 bid , it is likely to be on their own rather than in partnership with @entity12			1
that combination seemed possible when @entity10 let their pundit @entity47 work as a co-commentator on @entity49 matches last season , an experiment that has not been repeated this campaign			2
@entity53 is pictured presenting an episode of the @entity2 's @entity28 @entity53 delivers the news to his @entity57 followers on thursday afternoon the fact @entity29 did not come to the table for @entity3 highlights makes it all the more odd that they chose to sack lead football presenter @entity62 with immediate effect last week and replace him with @entity3 - friendly @entity64			1
the timing suggested a link with the highlights , yet @entity29 say @entity64 ’s appointment was unconnected			2
meanwhile , the @entity2 ’s retention of @entity28 is not expected to stop @entity53 hosting @entity12 ’s @entity72 coverage next season , although an exclusivity clause in @entity75 ’s @entity2 contract related to the @entity77 market will have to be renegotiated			2
broadcaster @entity64 was named as @entity79 's new lead football presenter last friday @entity62 , who has been replaced as @entity29 's lead football host , pictured in west @entity24 last friday no wonder @entity82 have been struggling to find a new shirt sponsor prepared to pay the sky - high price owner @entity86 believes that his team command			0
the classless club reacted to the @entity90 charging @entity91 for his blatant stamping offences by not holding a press conference before saturday 's pivotal @entity3 game against @entity95			2
the decision was supported by chairman @entity97 and the club board as well as communications chief @entity99			0
@entity91 , training with @entity82 on thursday , has contested his @entity90 charge for stamping on @entity102 @entity91 appears to stamp on @entity102 's right leg during a feisty opening period at @entity105 on tuesday can was left writhing on the ground in pain but @entity91 was not punished my referee @entity109 keeping the @entity3 highlights in their traditional 10.30pm slot on the @entity2 is good news for the @entity114 , who have an agreement with @entity117 for a 9pm start for their highlights next season			1
had @entity29 won the rights , there was a fear their highlights might have been scheduled to clash with @entity125			2
swimming in hot water @entity127 could have celebrated the success of football and cricket - both national sports - highlighted by their @entity132 but instead chose to hammer swimming ’s falling participation levels in their press release			0
overall annual sports participation numbers are down from 15.7million to 15.6m in the year ending october 2014 , for which @entity127 chief executive @entity137 blamed swimming , whose numbers dropped by 245,000			0
the poor figures meant @entity127 ’s promises to return swimming to multi-year funding after improved governance had to be put on hold			0
@entity127 trust their @entity132 data implicitly , although that confidence is not shared by every sport			0
@entity150 , who sponsor swimming , found participation in decline but not nearly as drastically as the @entity132 suggests			0
the survey also had cricket up when their own research showed a seven per cent fall			0
@entity158 certainly has n’t worked for the @entity161 - backed @entity160 presidential candidate @entity159 , whose stunt campaign folded on thursday night with the failure to find one nomination - let alone five			1
however , @entity166 fan @entity165 has used the online money - raising method to gather the £ 800 needed for a billboard poster in @entity169 in response to the @entity171 ’ advert outside @entity166 ’ new home at the @entity174			0
former @entity175 and @entity176 star @entity159 failed to get a nomination for @entity160 presidential candidacy			1

@entity2 are set to secure @entity3 highlights from 2016 - 17
@entity10 are considering joining @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in bidding for the live rights
@entity159 failed to get a nomination for @entity160 presidential candidacy
