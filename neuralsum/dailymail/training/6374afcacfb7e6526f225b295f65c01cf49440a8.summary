by @entity1 reporter published : 07:09 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 4 june 2013 when builder @entity3 retired he decided to scale down his activities - quite literally			1
the 67 - year - old , who could claim to be @entity8 's smallest builder , has created three miniature villages in his garden			1
he has also created a 12ft high model of @entity12 so he does n't lose track of time when pottering outdoors			1
the dome on this building was modelled on @entity30 , @entity31 @entity3 , of @entity32 , @entity33 , said : ' i have been working all my life outside and i can not just sit in the house and watch the television			1
' that 's why i decided to build the miniature houses as it gives me something to do			2
' so far i have built three different villages on my lawn , all around 15ft in size			2
' one of the villages is a miniature version of @entity32 where i live			2
' the second village is made using local stone from @entity50 and @entity51 and is based on houses i 've seen in the @entity53			2
' the third village is based on nice houses i have seen all over the country			0
' his phenomenal attention to detail goes into every building , from small cottages like this one , to larger grand buildings that resemble iconic institutions this is a replica of one of the houses in @entity3 's village of @entity32 , which he has recreated in his garden retired builder @entity3 has built three villages and towns in his garden the retired builder 's handy - work has now become a big hit with tourists , who stop to take photos			1
@entity3 first began building the villages 22 - years - ago as a hobby , using his garage as a workshop			1
he initially obtained planning permission to build six houses on his land			0
however after building three , @entity3 decided to use the rest of his land to build a garage and began producing miniature houses during the evenings and weekends to fill his garden			1
although his first miniature house took him around a month it build , it was n't long before @entity92 developed a mould which allows him to create a house in two days			1
the buildings , which have plastic windows , are made by filling a square mould with concrete			1
his latest work involves building a mansion based on @entity101 , in @entity102 , and a water feature which operates through a sensor when visitors pass			1
he takes great care to maintain the village gardens as well as the local pubs , churches , mills and waterways			2
the grand pillared building to his left was based on @entity102 's @entity101 hall attention to detail : @entity92 devotes his time now to making every inch of his miniature villages as realistic as possible practical : since he does n't like to wear a watch while working , @entity3 decided to build his own @entity12 so he could always check the time while toiling away work in progress : @entity3 said he has no plans to stop building his miniature villages any time soon as for his 12ft high @entity12 , @entity3 said : ' i do n't like wearing a watch when i am working in the garden so i built @entity12 so i would know what the time was			1
' it has four actual clocks inside and it took me around 12 weeks to make			0
' @entity3 , who also worked as a coal miner in @entity134 , admits the villages have become an attraction for visitors			1
he said : ' i think it makes the garden look nice and it also a bit of an attraction			2
' it 's a bit of interest for people passing through			0
' it is surprising the amount of people who stop and ask questions			0
' i get pleasure out of seeing people passing and taking pictures			0
running out of space : sat behind a replica of @entity32 's @entity153 ( front left ) , @entity3 said : ' my lawn is not big enough to make any more villages so i am just dotting the houses i make around the garden now			1
' tourists stop and gawp at the incredible creations @entity3 has built on his lawn , taking photos of his idyllic settlements devotion : @entity3 spends most of his time in his garage building new homes : ' i think the longer i live the more i will make			1
' and he has no plans to stop making miniature buildings anytime soon			2
@entity3 said : ' my lawn is not big enough to make any more villages so i am just dotting the houses i make around the garden now			1
' they will probably all join together one day			0
' i do n't know how many i want to make , i think the longer i live the more i will make			2
' i will be making them until i drop down dead			0
' it 's not quite @entity176 - but @entity177 is still proud of the huge velociraptor in the front garden of his semi in @entity181 , @entity182			1
crowds have been flocking to visit a prehistoric predator that answers to the name of @entity187			0
@entity177 said : ' ever since he pitched up here , he has had hundreds of visitors			0
i get at least four knocks at the door a day from people asking me if they can play with my dinosaur , it 's quite odd			0
the owner says he was given the model as a gift from a friend who used to keep @entity187 in his bar the dinosaur is now a useful landmark for people returning from a night out in @entity181 ' people go mad for him , they stop in their cars to take pictures and i have heard he has even got his own @entity207 page			0
' he says he was given the model as a gift from a friend who used to keep @entity187 in his bar			0
now he 's a useful landmark for people returning from a night out			0
' taxi drivers have told me they get a lot of people who live near here asking to be taken to where the dinosaur is on @entity219 , ' said @entity177			0
'' so he is helping out in that way			0

@entity3 , 67 , could n't bear to give up building so carried on in his garden
