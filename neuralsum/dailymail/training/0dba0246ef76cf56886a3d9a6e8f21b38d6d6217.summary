only 48 copies of the three - volume book , @entity17 1944 - 45 , were ever published , soon after the war - and are all held in museums or military institutions			2

the king had just knighted @entity30 on the battlefield - the first occasion that had happened since @entity67 in 1415 a modest man , sir @entity68 was one of the most important wartime generals but is almost completely unknown because of his determination to stay out of the limelight			1

' he completed a successful campaign with the capture of the northern ports of @entity138 in may 1945			0
' the reason @entity60 has not achieved the prominence of any other commander lies in the fact that he was extremely modest and selfless			0
' he would only accept praise and glory for his men and never for himself			0
' his modesty was also in evidence when he refused to take the surrender of some @entity138 , telling them to return when field marshal @entity61 was around			0
after the war , he declined to take the position of @entity152 and instead accepted the position of @entity129 commander in chief of @entity155			0
