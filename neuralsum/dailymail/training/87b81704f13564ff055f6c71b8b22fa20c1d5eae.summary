by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 21 january 2013 justice secretary @entity1 has described a plan to close an @entity4 unit as ‘ sticking two fingers up ’ at local residents – putting him on a collision course with the health secretary , @entity9			1
the emergency ward at @entity11 in @entity12 is under threat following a controversial recommendation by @entity16 officials			1
mr @entity1 , the local mp , has vowed to fight the proposals in a move that could trigger a @entity20 row			1
contentious : the justice secretary @entity1 ( left ) is on a collision course with @entity9 secretary @entity9 ( right ) over the proposed closure of the @entity4 unit at @entity11 he is the second minister to clash with the government in a backlash over nationwide closures of casualty units after @entity27 , the @entity28 , began a fight to save his local @entity4 ward at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , which may be closed later this year			1
mr @entity1 ’s intervention comes as professor sir @entity35 , @entity16 medical director , launches a review into how emergency services are organised , warning that the number of closures could accelerate because ‘ large - scale reorganisation ’ is needed			1
in a strongly worded email , mr @entity1 told constituents last week : ‘ it is very obvious that our own local doctors should have the main input in what happens			1
and yet the provisional recommendations have been put forward without them even having the chance to have their say			0
‘ i have therefore written to all of our local gps to ask them their views on the future of @entity11			1
if a good majority of our local doctors say they want to see changes , we will have to listen to them			2
but at the moment things seem to be moving ahead without them even having the chance to express their views			0
’ concern : @entity11 could lose its @entity4 department if controversial plans go ahead and he added : ‘ i hope the people who are carrying out this review realise today just how much they have effectively stuck two fingers up at @entity12 residents in the way that this has started			1
’ the ‘ @entity73 , @entity75 ’ review was originally being carried out into four hospitals in @entity77 : @entity79 ( @entity78 ) , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity83 ’s ( @entity82 ) , but last week @entity84 said it was being extended to include @entity11			2
proposals include having three hospitals with @entity4 and maternity units , meaning others could be downgraded or closed			1
mr @entity1 has claimed some of the financial difficulties at @entity11 have come as a result of losing some services to private providers			1
however , his intervention was last night described as ‘ hypocrisy ’ by @entity98 spokesman @entity97 because he backed the @entity99 , which opened up the @entity16 to competition from the private sector			0
mr @entity97 said : ‘ @entity1 is not the first @entity103 cabinet minister to be caught out			2
now it ’s coming home to roost , ministers might think again about ignoring local concerns and axeing @entity4 units to save cash			1
’ under threat : the entrance to the @entity4 at @entity11 the threat to @entity11 brings the total number of @entity113 around the country that could be closed or downgraded to 34			1
mr @entity9 himself staged a prolonged fight against the closure of his local hospital , the @entity119 in @entity120 , when it was threatened in 2006			1
the campaign , which saw him join a candlelight vigil outside @entity124 , was a success			0
the latest plans threatening @entity77 hospitals mean nine a&es in the capital now face the axe , leaving questions over how overstretched emergency services will cope			0
a @entity134 spokesman said it would need ‘ additional funding ’ to meet the extra demand caused by changes to the local @entity16			0
he said : ‘ we are facing increasing pressure and we can not absorb additional demand as a result of changes to local @entity16 services , particularly the closure of emergency departments			1
as well as the impact of increased journey times and potential increases in patient handover times at hospital , our experience shows that changes in @entity16 services can lead to increases in referrals to us from healthcare professionals			0
’ the regulator , the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) , has criticised poor staffing levels at the @entity134 , which have contributed to delays in response times for less urgent calls and led to staff training being cancelled			0
concerned : shadow health secretary @entity165 said @entity4 units were struggling the number of people waiting longer than four hours for treatment in @entity4 has rocketed by 20 per cent in a year			1
more than 600,000 people have spent over four hours waiting during 2012 - 13 so far – 100,000 more than in the same period the previous year			0
revealing the figures , shadow health secretary @entity165 said @entity113 units were struggling to cope and ‘ suffering from @entity174 ’s toxic mix of cuts and reorganisation ’			0
the government expects 95 per cent of all people attending @entity4 to be seen within four hours			2
but in the week ending january 13 , only 92 per cent of patients were seen within that time frame in major @entity4 units			2
it is the 16th consecutive week that the @entity16 has missed the target			0
a @entity159 report published last month said : ‘ there were not enough qualified , skilled and experienced staff to meet people ’s needs			0
‘ staffing levels should be reviewed and increased in light of increased demand on the service and to ensure that staff have sufficient time for breaks and training			0
’ the report also highlighted problems with missing or damaged equipment in ambulances which was putting patients at risk			0
in one case , a paramedic crew did not have a mechanical suction device when attending to a patient who was choking			0
in the end a kit was borrowed from other professionals on the scene			0
@entity209 , chief executive for @entity11 and @entity210 , said : ‘ no decisions have been made about which sites will be affected and further work needs to be done to determine whether the recommendations would work in practice			2
’ a @entity218 spokesman said : ‘ we have always been clear about changes to @entity4 – they are local decisions , they must have support of local clinicians and existing services can not be withdrawn until new and better arrangements are up and running			2
