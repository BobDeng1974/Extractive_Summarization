@entity0 , 14 , who organised a pupil walk - out at his school because they were being taught by too many supply teachers as maths problems go , it ’s not a tricky one			1
one despairing schoolboy minus one full - time maths teacher plus two flunked gcse options exams equals a classroom crisis			1
when @entity0 , 14 , called a wildcat walkout of pupils to protest about poor standards in maths teaching at his @entity17 high school , he caused a national debate about the prospects for pupils at the 416 @entity22 schools in special measures			1
now , in an exclusive interview with @entity25 , he reveals that he felt he had to take a stand after he scored just 16 out of a possible 95 in a double maths exam designed to help him choose his gcse options			1
he called the strike because he actually wanted extra help with his maths , felt he needed more homework to help him get on , and was fed up with the endless run of supply teachers who failed to turn up on time			1
‘ i am a normal schoolboy , in the middle set for most things and definitely not very good at maths , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ but i have to have a maths pass at @entity41			2
this is a pivotal point , you have to knuckle down and get on			0
i do not want to amble out of school at 16 without decent qualifications			0
‘ the strike was n’t about being famous for a few minutes or about making trouble for my school , which i love			1
it is about my prospects and the success i want to have in life after i have left			1
i do not want to move schools because that defeats the object of the exercise which is to make my school better for everyone			0
i will move if i have to , but what about the other children there ? how does that help them ? ’ the schoolyard strike at @entity64 in @entity17 on march 12 made @entity0 a teen folk hero and garnered headlines around the world			1
it also saw him excluded for two days and facing a critical reception from some older pupils when he returned last tuesday			1
but he does not regret his actions – even though they further embarrassed a school where , according to @entity74 in january 2013 ‘ standards are low and have declined ’			0
@entity75 , @entity17 - where @entity0 organised his sit in to protest against lack of work on friday , a third interim report concluded it must stay in special measures			1
this comes as no surprise to @entity0 , whose @entity84 maths lessons lost any rigour when his maths teacher left at @entity87			1
‘ the teacher who took over from her lasted a fortnight , if that , and then left , ’ he says			0
‘ and that ’s when it started to go downhill			0
' we were left to do what we wanted ; people were eating and drinking in lessons , chatting to friends , not concentrating , just not learning			0
’ there followed , @entity0 estimates , a carousel of six or seven different teachers , some supply , some staff maths teachers drafted in from other classes , before a new teacher was appointed three weeks ago			1
some taught him just once , meaning he rarely got the help , or the homework , he needed			1
he lavishly praises the teacher who left			0
asked why , he says : ‘ she taught us			0
she was always in class on time , she helped us , acknowledged our effort , she set us homework and marked our books			2
’ as a result of the shambles , @entity0 complained			1
he approached a staff maths teacher as well as his own head of year and then saw @entity118 ’s acting head , @entity117			2
when he did not feel he was being taken seriously , he emailed @entity17 and @entity74			1
' ... i do n't want to leave without qualifications ... ' and then , at 12.15pm on march 12 , he organised a demonstration outside classroom @entity123 , his old maths class			1
he had invited 20 like - minded pupils , but soon the numbers doubled and @entity0 had to direct the crowd out to the school field where they sang @entity130			1
teachers came running , believing a fight was in progress			0
i had a piece of paper with two bullet points on it			0
the first point said grades and the second said teaching			0
' i did n’t have a plan or a script apart from that – i ’d only thought of it the night before and i had n’t even confided in my mum			2
‘ i got the idea of a strike after watching walkouts on the tv			2
i told my teachers i was sorry but at least i ’d got their attention			0
they said it was n’t a good kind of attention , that it was n’t respectful , but i did n’t care			2
i was glad i finally had some			0
’ @entity0 loves his school , rates many of his teachers and admires mrs @entity117 , who he says is ‘ all about education , very approachable and can get things done ’			1
yet he , rather than the creaking superstructure of @entity64 , was blamed for the mutiny and excluded for two days			2
‘ i was shocked , ’ he says			0
‘ i thought i might get detention but i ’m not a serial offender , i do n’t fight or cause trouble			2
i have been criticised by kids who are not in my year but my friends are supportive			0
’ as are his parents , @entity171 , 52 , who works in a sandwich shop , and taxi driver @entity173 , 64			0
@entity0 comes from an ordinary family – two hard - working parents who live in a semi and whose budget stretches no further than an annual break in a @entity22 holiday camp			1
@entity171 says : ‘ @entity0 is a lovely boy ; he ’s kind , well behaved and responsible			2
' he is stubborn but in a good way			0
he wo n’t back down if he believes in something			2
he has achieved what he set out to and we are proud of him for that			0
’ if you were to give marks for resourcefulness , @entity0 would get an @entity188			2
he got himself a role as an extra in @entity190 last year and works as a reporter for the children ’s pages of his local paper			0
as for the school , it ca n’t comment on @entity0 , but mrs @entity117 said : ‘ this is undoubtedly a challenging time			1
however , we continue to try to improve teaching standards			0
’ @entity118 ’s motto is @entity201 , the best from all , but despite those bold words , its end - of - term report is still going to read : ‘ could do better			0
