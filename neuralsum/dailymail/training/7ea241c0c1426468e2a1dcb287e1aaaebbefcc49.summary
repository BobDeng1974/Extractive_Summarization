@entity0 says that @entity1 are unlikely to spend in the january transfer window despite the problems with his strikeforce this season			1
@entity1 have been hit hard by the departure of @entity7 in the summer and injuries to @entity9 which have kept the @entity11 international out since august , with winger @entity12 being used in a central role in recent weeks			1
but @entity0 expects @entity9 to be back in action by mid-january after he returns from his rehabilitation in @entity16 later this week , and still believes £ 16million signing @entity17 can make a contribution – albeit off the bench – therefore reducing the need for new signings			1

' we 've brought in players we feel we can develop in the summer			0
my job is to coach the players who are here			0
' i do n't think it 's a good time to spend			2
last year we did n't bring in anyone in			0
the owners will always back what we want to do			2
if there was something we felt would benefit the group in the short or long - term then we 'd do it , but i do n't want to stockpile players			0
we 've got some outstanding young talents			0
my focus will always be on what we 've got from within			0

' @entity1 lost @entity7 ( left ) and have been without the injured @entity9 ( right ) recently @entity17 has only scored twice since moving to @entity1 from @entity52 in the summer and has yet to find the net in the @entity54			1
asked if the former @entity56 striker is going the same way as @entity58 , whose @entity60 career never got off the ground before he was offloaded to @entity62 , @entity0 replied : ' i do n't see that			1
the team functions in a certain way and we need a certain profile of player to make it work as it has been over the past few weeks			2
' he 's a player who still has contribution to make for us			1
he 's working hard in training and wants to be the best he can be			2
whether he starts a game or comes off the bench we will look for a contribution from him			2
' @entity1 have had a difficult first half to the season after finishing runners - up in the @entity54 in may , although seven points from three games over @entity83 has lifted the mood around @entity60			1
@entity0 believes 2014 has been a good year on the whole and is looking forward to the second half of the season as his team challenge for another top - four finish			1
@entity17 ( left ) has only scored twice since moving to @entity1 from @entity52 in the summer @entity17 ( right ) is yet to score in the @entity54 since the £ 16m move and @entity0 is backing the striker ' it 's been another year of progress , he added			1
' obviously since the end of last season it 's not been as good as what we 've wanted but over the course of 2014 we 've made significant strides forward			2
' if you look at the points total over the course of the year only two teams are above us , @entity56 and @entity106			0
' despite the start to this season we 've actually made good progress			0
i 'm pleased but we 've still got a lot of work to do			0
' there are a lot of very good teams trying to get into the top four			0
@entity106 and @entity56 are up there and too far ahead for us to effect that at this stage , but there are a number of other positions to go for			0
' for us we 're building confidence and momentum and i 'm really looking forward to the second half of the season			0
