by @entity0 published : 20:44 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 20:46 est , 18 november 2013 hard times : @entity2 , pictured , has said elderly people are ' discarded like rubbish ' and thrown away coming home at the end of a busy day , @entity2 puts the key into her front door and finds herself in a dark , empty flat			1
there is nobody for her to make a cup of tea for , nobody to ask her about her day and nobody to sit on the sofa with to watch tv			2
it is for the tv presenter a lonely time and has been since her husband , @entity20 , passed away 13 years ago			1
the 73 - year - old , best known for presenting @entity23 television series @entity21 , has admitted she has found it difficult to adapt to life on her own and knows she is not alone as yesterday she said older people are often treated like ‘ discarded rubbish with a sell by date ’			1
and with @entity31 approaching , miss @entity2 is only too aware that this is the loneliest time for some of the @entity35 ’s 10 million people now over 65			1
with this in mind she is rolling out @entity38 , a 24 - hour helpline service aimed at elderly people who are struggling to cope with loneliness , nationally on monday november 25			1
talking about her decision to set up the service she said in a new interview with the @entity45 : ‘ recently i received a letter from @entity47 , clearly a clever woman who has brought up a family and held a responsible job , and yet who feels that in her old age “ my days are pointless and i ’m a waste of space ”			2
‘ reading it , i felt a surge of anger			2
something must be done to assure our older population that they are valued			2
we must reach out to them , link them back into their communities , and convince them that older people are a resource , a national treasure			1
there must be no sell - by date , no moment when older people become rubbish to be discarded , thrown away			1
loneliness is , according to the @entity74 , as dangerous physically as smoking or obesity			0
mentally and emotionally , it is utterly destructive			0
‘ this is the generation that does not readily ask for help			0
they do n’t want to be a burden			0
@entity83 is a creeping enemy , it isolates , erodes confidence , until it becomes more and more difficult to step outside the front door			0
’ loneliness : miss @entity2 lost her husband @entity20 , pictured , 13 - years - ago and has struggled with life alone ever since miss @entity2 ’s late husband , documentary - maker mr @entity20 , died from heart disease in 2000			1
their relationship began as an affair in 1968 , when he was her head of department at the @entity23			0
they married in 1977 and spent 30 years together until his death , aged 69 , and had three children together			1
however , the presenter has been living on her own for the past two years after her youngest child @entity101 , now 32 , moved out			1
she sold the family home and now lives in a two bedroom flat in @entity105			0
it was earlier this year that miss @entity2 spoke of her own sadness at being a widow , saying she would give up a decade of her life to spend just ten more minutes by her late husband ’s side			1
miss @entity2 has also revealed she had even once pleaded with her daughter @entity112 , 34 , to move back in with her in a bid to help her overcome her loneliness			0
however , she admitted it never happened , adding ‘ what was i thinking ? she ’s a young woman who values her independence and has every right to live by herself			0
’ family : documentary maker @entity20 , who died from heart disease , with his wife and their children @entity112 , 4 , @entity126 , 3 , and @entity101 , 2 for miss @entity2 loneliness is linked with loss , she states in her @entity45 piece : ‘ the loss of a partner , of a job , of a neighbourhood , of friends			1
‘ some people are alone all their lives and never feel it			1
but @entity139 wrote to me : “ i have just said goodbye to my wife who died of @entity141 ’s			0
it ’s 65 years since we married , but more to the point , 72 since we first kissed			1
and she waited for me throughout the war , and i for her			0
loneliness … tell me about it			0
” ' having successfully set up the @entity146 telephone service , miss @entity2 knew providing a similar service for the eldery would prove just as invaluable			0
she said : ‘ @entity146 has shown that a helpline that ’s free , safe and confidential can transform lives			1
over the last 27 years , 3.2 million children have rung 0800 1111 and found the support and comfort they desperately needed			1
now we are launching a helpline for older people , @entity38			1
we have been running a pilot service for the past year , funded by @entity158			2
it has already transformed lives			0
as one gentleman told us , “ when i put the telephone down , i feel like i belong to the human race			0
” help at hand : the television presenter , pictured working at a @entity146 call centre , is launching ' @entity38 ' - a helpline for the elderly - on november 25 the @entity38 has been running as a pilot for a year but will now be available nationally			1
callers will be provided with information , friendship and advice linking them with projects in their communities			0
volunteers will also be trained up to become @entity175 , making regular calls to older people to talk , discuss their hopes and dreams , pick over the news and share views			2
miss @entity2 added : ‘ our hope for the future is that @entity38 will find its place in enriching older people ’s lives , and counteracting loneliness , the most terrible poverty of all			2
’ pensioners need to realise there is more to life than having a nice garden , an expert on ageing said yesterday			2
@entity196 , of @entity197 , said that society was sidelining the elderly , leading to a ‘ criminal waste ’ of their knowledge and experience			2
but retirees who settle for ‘ tending the roses ’ also have to shoulder some responsibility			0
he said : ‘ this is a massive personal resource that is being parked in the potting shed , or wherever			0

73 - year - old said @entity31 can be lonely for @entity35 *'s* 10 million people over 65
