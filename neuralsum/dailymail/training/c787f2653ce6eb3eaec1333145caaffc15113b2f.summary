pensioners will today be offered new freedoms to dip into their retirement cash			2
in the latest phase of the biggest shake - up of private pensions in a century , the over- 55s will be able to withdraw several lump sums from their pension pots instead of just one			1
@entity9 ’s move raises the prospect of pensioners using their funds almost like bank accounts to invest in property or shares , pay off debts or help children and grandchildren			2
shake - up : the latest phase in changes to pensions will be announced today by chancellor @entity9 the chancellor has already announced that they will no longer have to buy poor - value annuities			1
and a crippling 55 per cent tax charge on pensions left to children and grandchildren is being abolished altogether			2
up until now , retirees were able to take 25 per cent of their pension tax free – a sum fixed on the day they first dipped into their pots			1
if you had a £ 100,000 pot at the age of 55 , the maximum you could take tax - free was £ 25,000			1
the rest typically went into an annuity			0
however , in the @entity39 the chancellor will announce you can dip into your fund multiple times and have 25 per cent of each slice tax free			1
the balance would remain invested and grow , again tax free – giving savers an incentive to keep their money invested in the stock market			2
money headaches : previously couples had to decide what they would do with their pensions the first time they dipped into the pot , creating a system which was less flexible than the one being introduced ( posed by models ) under today ’s proposals , if the 55 - year - old with a pension pot of £ 100,000 was to withdraw £ 5,000 they would receive £ 1,250 – or 25 per cent – tax free and the remaining £ 3,750 would be taxed at their current income tax rate			1
the £ 95,000 remaining in their pension fund – and any growth – could later be withdrawn in as many instalments as they wanted – 25 per cent of it tax free			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ people who have worked hard and saved all their lives should be free to choose what they do with their money , and that freedom is central to our long - term economic plan			1
‘ from next year they ’ll be able to access as much or as little of their defined contribution pension as they want and pass on their hard - earned pensions to their families tax - free			1
’ criticism : @entity80 said the move could encourage people to overspend early in retirement @entity84 , a pensions expert and a @entity86 adviser on older people , said : ‘ the government ’s changes have the potential to help millions of pension savers make better use of their pension funds			1
being free to access their money freely as they need to , rather than being forced to buy particular products , will be very popular			0
‘ it ’s something you could n’t do ever before because of the inflexibility of the system			0
‘ as soon as you wanted to take any money at all out of your pension fund , you had to secure an income with the remainder			0
so you had to buy an annuity or a drawdown product			0
‘ now you will have the freedom to do what you want			0
however , people need to know that their pension provider will allow them to take advantage of the new freedoms			0
‘ currently , most pension companies are not ensuring that their customers can take money out flexibly			0
i call on the industry to make sure people can really benefit from the new changes as quickly as possible			0
’ some economists and @entity121 mps warn that allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pots rather than forcing most to buy an annuity , providing an income for life , was risky			2
most people at 60 or 65 underestimate their life expectancy and could overspend early in retirement , they argue			1
but mr @entity9 insisted that the 13million people in defined contribution pension schemes are ‘ responsible people ’ who had saved throughout their lives and were quite capable of making decisions for themselves , with professional advice			1
he used his party conference speech last month to announce another reform – an end to ‘ penal ’ taxes on pension cash left by people to their children and grandchildren			0
at present , if people die without exhausting their pension funds , their inheritance to any children or grandchildren over the age of 23 is taxed at a ruinous 55 per cent			0
but from april next year , the tax will be abolished altogether , bringing it into line with money left to spouses			0
in another boost for pensioners , the government ’s ‘ triple lock ’ to guarantee rises in the state pension above inflation and wages is expected to take effect today			2
today ’s inflation figures are the ones traditionally used to fix the pension increase for next year			2
but with experts saying the inflation rate is likely to be well below 2.5 per cent , the triple lock will kick in to ensure a rise at that level – meaning another significant real - terms increase in pensioners ’ pockets .			0

move will be announced today by the chancellor @entity9
it is latest phase of biggest shake - up of private pensions for a century
change is in rule which allows 25 **%** of pension to be withdrawn tax - free
