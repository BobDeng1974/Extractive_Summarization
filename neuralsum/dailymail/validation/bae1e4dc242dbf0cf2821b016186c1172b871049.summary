asking a young child to talk about @entity1 and the concept of human rights , equality or the right to individual self - realisation is quite a leap from asking them about their favourite food			2
but that 's exactly what @entity12 has done , in a heart - warming video called @entity15 , which poses such questions to children ranging in age from five to nine			1
one girl is asked : what did @entity1 do ? she says : ' he stood up for what he believed - that white people should n't just have all the fun and black people should have fun as well			1
' another is asked : who was @entity1 ? she replies : ' @entity1 was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should			1
' but then he was put into jail because of what he said - and then he finally went out because people were protesting for him to come out			2
and then there was a song @entity38 - and everything kind of became how he wanted it to be			0
' meanwhile , an equally challenging poser is put to a ' short five - year - old ' boy : what does equality look like ? his sweet response ? ' if there was one man over here like he was five years old , and one man over here like he was five years old too , they would all be the same size			0
' ' @entity1 was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should			2
' this was the reply to one of a series of human rights questions put by @entity12 to children aged five to nine ' fear - the more you worry about it , the bigger it gets ... and the more you think positively , the more fear would be , like friendly - you would n't worry about anything , and have a great time basically ' ' if there was one man over here like he was five years old , and one man over here like he was five years old too , they would all be the same size ' other questions put to the youngsters included topics that might faze some grown - ups			1
for example : at a time of daunting global events , many people are afraid			1
what would you advise ? a boy , aged about nine 's reply ? ' fear - the more you worry about it , the bigger it gets ... and the more you think positively , the more fear would be , like friendly - you would n't worry about anything , and have a great time basically			1
' the video was released by the human rights organisation to coincide with the publication of its new book @entity87 on @entity89			1
the book combines the words of human rights heroes such as @entity1 , the @entity92 , @entity93 , chief @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 with beautiful illustrations from international artists including @entity99 and @entity100			2
in a time when children across the world are traumatised , frightened and confused by news events , the aim of the book is to empower them to explore hard - won rights and understand how precious they are			1
' the world would n't be the same ... the world would be terrible - and it would be quite boring ' ' being unique without anybody stopping you being unique ' the video was released by the human rights organisation to coincide with the publication of its new book @entity117 on @entity89 author and former children ’s laureate @entity119 wrote in the foreword to the book : ' @entity87 is a feast of visual stories – brave words and beautiful pictures , woven together to inspire young readers to stand up for others and to make a difference			1
' it gives me great hope for the freedom of future generations			0
' i have grown up , not in a perfect country by any means , but in a society where , by and large , we can say what we like , write what we like , be who we want to be , so long as we do not threaten the liberty of others and so long as we respect their rights			0
' what we can forget , if we are not careful , is that it was not always like this			0
these rights have been fought for , died for , argued over , for centuries			0
' indeed the struggle to protect and defend our freedom goes on , both in our own country and in the world beyond			0
' @entity152 , @entity12 ’s @entity153 director , said : ' in a time when many children ca n't help seeing news about threats from terrorism and other atrocities , this book celebrates heroism and shows how important it is for all of us to stand up and make a difference			1
' every child should be given the strength to stand up for themselves and each other			0
' there is no better book to inspire and empower young readers , to give them courage and confidence for the future			0
' @entity174 ’ can be pre-ordered from good bookshops or at http://amnestyshop.org.uk / - published march 5			0
