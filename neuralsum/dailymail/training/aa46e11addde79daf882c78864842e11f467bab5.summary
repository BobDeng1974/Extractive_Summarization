she said : ‘ the current strikes , and further proposed strikes , will cause great damage to the education of young people in both of these schools and i have no doubt that other schools will be affected			2
’ the letter added : ‘ i am disgusted by the response of the @entity11 : instead of negotiating with the employer , it has chosen to strike in selected schools , thereby damaging the life chances of vulnerable young people in this authority			2
‘ it can not be right that children should be made to pay for a dispute that is essentially between a union official and her employer , the local authority			1
’ teachers at the two schools will walk out again with ballots planned at two more schools – @entity60 and @entity61			0

twelve secondary school heads voiced their ‘ disgust ’ yesterday at strikes in support of mrs @entity10 , pictured , who is battling to keep her job as a full - time union official ‘ i 'm self - employed so it 's been difficult to get on with my work with the children at home , ’ she said			1
' i worry that this may set a precedent for the future			0
' why does she think she can disrupt all the kids in their schooling just because she feels the rules do n't apply to her ? ' i do n't see why the kids have to be dragged into this			0
' it beggars belief and it 's tantamount to blackmail			0
she 's blackmailing the council			0
' it 's wrong and she 's showing no sign of backing down			0
she seems determined she 's going to win this no matter what - and at the expense of the children			2
' i 'm so frustrated about this , it really annoys me			0
’ meanwhile a father in his 40s whose children attend @entity26 school said : ' we are just concerned about our children 's education			2
they 're being used for a political issue which is nothing to do with them			0

the letter from local secondary heads said : ‘ secondary school head teachers have found , and continue to find , that ms @entity10 ' preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation			1

’ another letter , from a ‘ significant number of primary head teachers ’ , stated : ‘ it is our view that it is simply not feasible to do so whilst current union working practices exist			0
’ mrs @entity10 was suspended in july over the concerns expressed by heads as well as other allegations , including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a @entity124 mayor ‘ abusing ’ her position and also that she fired off a rude email to a councillor after food waste was not collected in her street			1
