by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:56 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 08:21 est , 20 december 2012 detectives were last night investigating claims of an extraordinary police plot to ‘ blacken the name ’ of @entity6 – as a fabricated email sent by a serving officer was made public			1
the barely literate message helped cost the then chief whip his job , despite the fact key sections of it were directly contradicted by @entity16 footage viewed by the cabinet secretary sir @entity17 days later			1
crucially , it was sent to mr @entity6 ’s deputy @entity19 on the evening of september 20 – the night before details of his ‘ @entity24 ’ confrontation with police officers in @entity23 were made public by @entity26 newspaper			1
controversy : @entity6 with his wife yesterday the altercation happened on the evening of september 19 when mr @entity6 tried to leave @entity23 on his bicycle by the main gate , but was told by police that he must use the side gate			1
he admits swearing at the officers but denies the most damaging allegation , that he called them ‘ f * * * ing plebs ’			1
mr @entity6 clung on to his job for three weeks before resigning when he lost the confidence of fellow @entity40 mps			2
the timing of the email , four days before an alleged copy of the official police log was leaked to the @entity45 , shows that the sender had access to internal police information			1
in it , the sender attempts to corroborate the account of officers on the gate , saying that mr @entity6 called them plebs and ‘ continued to shout obscenities at the poor police officer ’			1
the email is now known to have been sent by a serving police officer posing as a member of the public and claiming to have witnessed the incident as a passer - by			2
a second email claiming to be from an alleged witness to the incident was sent to mr @entity19 a few days later but its contents have not been disclosed			0
a constable in the elite @entity68 has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office			0
metropolitan police commissioner @entity71 has said the officer was not at the scene as he claimed , but has insisted this does not undermine the account given by the officers on duty			1
mr @entity71 has repeatedly backed the account by his officers who confronted mr @entity6 in @entity23 and last night the @entity80 said his position has not changed			1
yesterday @entity82 announced a major investigation into the controversy manned by 30 detectives			0
the inquiry is being supervised by the @entity87			0
the inquiry will examine whether the officer who sent the email was acting alone or whether there was ‘ any evidence of a conspiracy ’			2
detectives are also investigating the source of the stories in the @entity26 and @entity45			0
during prime minister 's questions , @entity96 today expressed his dismay at the allegation that a police officer tried to ' blacken the name ' of a cabinet minister ' @entity96 told @entity39 yesterday : ‘ a police officer posing as a member of the public and sending an email potentially to blacken the name of a cabinet minister is a very serious issue and does need to be seriously investigated			1
’ the first email was released by @entity112 last night			0
the programme ’s political correspondent , @entity113 , said the officer had admitted not being at the scene , adding : ‘ the impression i got was that he was a very frightened man – even hinting that there were others in the background			0
’ former shadow home secretary @entity122 said mr @entity6 had been the victim of ‘ a really serious injustice ’ and should be restored to the ministerial ranks			2
he said : ‘ this is a shocking revelation that a police officer seems to have masqueraded as a civilian – more than seems to , i ’ve seen the emails and clearly did so – and acted in a way which effectively completely undermined mr @entity6 in the eyes of the prime minister and the rest of @entity23 right at the point they were making the decision : do we support him or not ? ’ mr @entity6 used freedom of information laws to obtain a copy of @entity16 footage which he says contradicts the official police report of the incident mr @entity6 left his @entity143 home this morning amid calls from some @entity40 mps for him to be reinstated in the government the email is littered with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes , including a reference to mr @entity6 ’s ‘ digesting behaviour ’			1
the author claims to have been showing his nephew from @entity154 around @entity143 when he witnessed the clash between mr @entity6 and police officers			2
he went on : ‘ imagine to our horror when we heard @entity159 shout very loudly at the police officers guarding “ you ( expletive blacked out ) plebes ! ! ” and “ you think you run the ( expletive blacked out ) country ” and just continued to shout obscenities at the poor police officers			0
’ the account in the leaked police log of the clash also states that there were ‘ several members of the public present opposite the pedestrian gate ’			1
they were said to have been ‘ visibly shocked ’ by the language mr @entity6 used			0
but @entity16 footage suggests there were only a few passers - by while the confrontation was taking place – and that none of them appeared to be interested in what was going on			1
the @entity16 footage is silent , making it impossible to know what mr @entity6 said , although it appears to have been only a brief exchange			1
cabinet secretary , @entity17 cabinet secretary sir @entity17 was under fire last night over an ‘ incompetent ’ investigation into police claims that @entity6 called them ‘ plebs ’ during an angry confrontation in @entity23			1
sir @entity17 , @entity193 ’s most powerful civil servant , was asked to carry out an investigation into the explosive claims in september after a police account was leaked to the press , and @entity23 was passed two emails claiming to be from a witness to the event			1
yesterday it emerged that sir @entity17 had viewed the @entity16 evidence that casts doubt on the version of events provided by both the police at the scene and the fabricated evidence in the email sent by another officer posing as a member of the public			1
@entity213 said sir @entity17 concluded that he ‘ could not be confident that the evidence in the emails was reliable ’			0
but , incredibly , he did not draw any conclusions about the accuracy of the police log – or even ask to look at it			2
sir @entity17 told the prime minister that the @entity16 footage contradicted police claims that the clash with mr @entity6 was witnessed by a number of ‘ shocked ’ onlookers stood at the gates of @entity23			1
but neither man took the issue further with the police			0
sir @entity17 went to ground yesterday , pulling out of a @entity231 event at which he would have faced questions from the @entity197			0
former shadow home secretary @entity122 said the investigation was ‘ not exactly @entity234 ’			0
he added : ‘ all the investigations did not go to the heart of the matter			0
look at the @entity16 , see whether it is consistent with the allegations made , consistent with what ’s been said			2
’ @entity242 , a member of @entity244 ’s @entity243 , said : it looks as if the so - called witness statement was not properly interrogated and i have to say … i do think that does speak of an incompetent inquiry undertaken by @entity213			0
’ @entity23 denied that the investigation had been botched			0
‘ the prime minister ’s view is that reasonable inquiries were made , ’ mr @entity96 ’s official spokesman said			2
‘ its conclusion was that one could n’t be confident that the evidence in the emails was reliable , including on the basis of a number of inconsistencies with the @entity16 footage			2
‘ there clearly remains a genuine difference of view about what words were actually used … the review was of the e-mail evidence that was submitted to us			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity6 demands an inquiry into ' completely untrue ' allegations that he called @entity23 officers ' f * * * * * * plebs '
' three phrases were hung around my neck and used to destroy my career '
@entity96 ' furious ' at reports an off duty officer tried to ' blacken the name of a cabinet minister '
@entity16 footage casts doubt on account in leaked police log
