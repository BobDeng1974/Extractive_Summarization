but hidden behind @entity5 ’s surburban home lies a tropical wonderland			2
the bamboos , palms , banana trees and lush greenery would not be out of place in a steamy @entity13 jungle			0
there is even a wooden ‘ jungle lodge ’ to complete the garden ’s exotic feel			1
secret garden : @entity5 , 57 , has created this stunning jungle garden at his home in @entity21 , @entity22 where the wild things are : the tropical garden is filled with banana trees , bamboo plants and palm trees the tropical garden even has a wooden hut in the middle of it where mr @entity5 can entertain his guests when mr @entity5 , 57 , and his wife moved into their house in @entity38 , @entity21 , 25 years ago their back garden was simply a long and narrow lawn			1
the prospect of many hours of mowing inspired the software salesman to transform the turf into something far more interesting			0
he planted various shrubs every year , put down timber walkways and constructed ponds which he filled with koi carp			0
over two decades the foliage thrived and grew to fill the 85ft by 30ft garden			0
mr @entity5 built the thatched lodge six years ago at a cost of £ 2,000			1
the best things are worth waiting for : @entity5 shows his neighbour @entity55 around the garden which has taken him 20 years to complete adapting : despite temperatures in @entity22 often dropping below freezing in the winter months , mr @entity5 says his tropical plants manage to @entity61 weather surprisingly well delivery : mr @entity5 transporting gunneras ready to plant in his exotic garden transformation : the garden started off as a regular back yard before its metamorphosis this sunday he is opening the space up to the public as part of a ‘ garden trail ’ designed to inspire visitors with ideas of how to transform a small piece of land			1
visitors would be forgiven for thinking they have been whisked away to the @entity78 rather than a suburb in @entity22			2
mr @entity5 , who spends about eight hours a week maintaining his greenery , said : ‘ i ’m not overly bothered about mowing lawns			1
i had always wanted a garden with wooden walkways and koi carp and lush planting			0
’ towering over the jungle : @entity5 's outdoor hut has views across his garden under construction : @entity5 has spent years - and thousands of pounds - constructing his garden paradise as well as bamboos and palms , a variety of ferns , gunneras and hostas combine to create the tropical effect			1
the garden copes well with the northern climate , except the banana plants , which are kept inside during winter			2
mr @entity5 added : ‘ there is no special skill			0
it ’s basic carpentry skills , a bit of pond digging … and putting plants in			0
’ transformation : the keen gardener used wooden blanks and poles to give his paradise an authentic jungle feel early stages : the hut is pictured halfway through being constructed before the roof was put on top of it hard graft : a small digger in the back of mr @entity5 's garden levels the ground so the foundations of his hut can be laid down			1

@entity5 , 57 , has spent 20 years creating his dream garden in @entity22
it takes the keen gardener eight hours to maintain it every single week
he spent £ 2,000 constructing a ' jungle lodge ' and £ 150 a year on new plants
