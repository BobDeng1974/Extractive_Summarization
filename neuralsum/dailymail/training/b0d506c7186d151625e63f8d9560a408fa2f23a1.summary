in a season in which many big - name signings failed at @entity4 last season , one at last stood out as a player of the highest quality			1
@entity8 turned up late in the @entity4 spending spree last summer , arriving on august 31st from @entity10 , one of seven transfers designed to fill the considerable hole left by @entity15 ’s departure from the team			1
he ended up proving something more than an afterthought , however , being the player who most consistently delivered over the course of the season , despite a change of managers and playing philosophy mid-season from @entity25 to @entity26 , and his free kicks are now an established major part of @entity4 ’s weaponry			1
pass notes : @entity8 ( r ) claims that @entity4 are playing like @entity10 under @entity31 philosophy : @entity31 wants @entity4 to play a high intensity passing and pressing game ‘ i think i was a bit impressed that i could keep up that level , ' said @entity8			1
’ i had so many games			0
at @entity10 , there were a lot of games but you were in and out of them			1
here it ’s a harder competition and it got harder and harder , so i think i impressed myself			0
’ it was n’t the easiest season in which to settle			2
‘ we had some pretty dark days , ’ he says , referring to the 6 - 0 and 5 - 1 defeats against @entity49 , the 5 - 0 defeat to @entity51			0
now of course he has yet another manager to impress , his third in 11 months at @entity4 , in @entity31			1
all the early signs are good			0
@entity8 looks to be carrying on from where he left off last season , with @entity31 ’s insistence on passing football seemingly more to @entity8 ’s taste than the direct style of @entity62			1
in fact the @entity64 manager seems closer to the @entity10 philosophy that @entity8 imbibed as a youth in @entity68 , where he trained under @entity69			1
‘ i think a lot of the ideas are a bit similar : that he wants to play football ; if you can turn , you turn ; if you can play forward , you play forward			0
and again it ’s a bit about ball possession and structure and where you need to run			0
’ there is one downside to the @entity31 way : the constant pressing he insists upon requires a level of intensity in pre-season training that few of the @entity4 players have previously experienced			1
‘ it ’s been a hard pre-season , ’ admitted @entity8			1
‘ we ’ve been getting closer to where we want to be when the season starts			0
the first few weeks there were times when we went to bed pretty early			0
‘ now of course you try to get used to it			0
there have been double sessions two times a week when we were training at 10 o ' clock and then again at 4 , so it ’s a long day			0
mentally as well it ’s pretty hard but it ’s fun to play football , so it ’s alright			0
’ @entity116 of class : the @entity119 international believes the manager has got them playing like former club @entity10 mentors : the @entity4 playmaker was schooled by @entity125 legends @entity69 and @entity126 ( @entity127 ) famously @entity31 had @entity129 players walking over hot coals in pre-season last year , though it seems @entity4 ’ players have been spared that for now			1
‘ we have n’t done that , ’ says @entity8 , a little alarmed at the suggestion			2
‘ only at @entity129 are they walking on fire ! ’ @entity138 , @entity8 , like everyone in football , was taken with @entity31 ’s @entity129 last season			1
‘ i think i was impressed like everyone else			0
when we played against them they wanted to play football and for me personally that ’s a good thing , that you want to keep the ball and create something			2
’ as for those @entity8 specials , the free kicks in which he now has a reputation , there has been less time to practice at present , given the intensity of the training			2
‘ i do spend a lot of time on them but i have n’t done it this much in the pre-season			0
on target : the 22 - year - old scored seven league goals for @entity4 last season ' we are training really hard so you do n’t want to load your legs too much , too early			1
but last year it was pretty much every day doing shooting and that is probably going to happen again this season			2
‘ i prefer to practice with a keeper			0
it ’s funny to beat the keeper			0
’ @entity175 is spared that indignity , however ; a reserve team keeper usually comes out to help @entity8			2
it ’s a skill he developed as a youngster at @entity10 , where @entity69 was his youth team coach , although for this area of the game he had to seek help from elsewhere			1
‘ i ’ve never really seen him ( @entity69 ) shoot a free - kick			1
@entity186 used to take them at @entity188			0
so he did n’t teach me anything about free - kicks , no. i learnt some from @entity126			1
he loved to take free - kicks as well			0
he tried to help me sometimes			0
’ we 're ready ! @entity4 will hope to hit the ground running after a decent pre-season campaign hammered time ? @entity4 play @entity196 in their opening game after losing to them three times last season new season : @entity200 stars in @entity201 15 on saturday against @entity196 we will get an idea as to whether the @entity31 era has begun to make some substantial differences to @entity4			1
they lost three times to @entity196 last season , thrashed 3 - 0 at home , losing in the @entity210 and then going down at @entity211 at the end of the season after @entity214 was sent off early on			1
‘ i do n’t know why we played badly against them , ’ said @entity8 , speaking at the launch of @entity218 new @entity217 deal			1
‘ we still had chances but we didn ’ t score and they did			0
of course we were a bit unlucky with the red card and everything			0
hopefully , if we keep ourselves in the game , we ’ll have a better chance than we had last year			2
of course , they play different from what we want to do , but we will have to show we can do better than last year			2
’ indeed , and if @entity31 pre-season training is anything to go by , they should at least come out of the blocks flying			2

@entity4 are playing like @entity10 under @entity31 , says @entity8
