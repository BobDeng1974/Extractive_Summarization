after the launch of the @entity2 and @entity2 , several new owners complained that the slim aluminium phones bent out of shape after being placed in tight pockets			1
so to avoid another ‘ bend gate , ’ @entity6 is rumoured to be planning on using stronger materials to construct its next generation smartphone			1
the forthcoming phone could feature the same @entity13 aluminium as its forthcoming @entity15 edition , which is reportedly also used in competition bicycles			2
this image shows a bent @entity21 the material would make the next @entity2 60 per cent harder than the @entity2 6 , @entity23 - based @entity22 reported			1
the metal is the same as that used to make professional sports bikes but has been altered by @entity6 to make it lighter , according to cult of @entity31 the forthcoming phone could feature the same @entity13 aluminium as its forthcoming @entity6 watch sport edition ( pictured ) , which is reportedly also used in competition bicycles the @entity15 has a lightweight anodised aluminium case			1
@entity6 used a new alloy of @entity37 aluminium that 's 60 per cent stronger than standard alloys			1
the same alloy is used to make racing bikes			2
the display is protected by strengthened @entity43 glass			0
together , the materials make the @entity15 edition 30 per cent lighter than the other @entity47 models			1
@entity6 polishes the aluminium used in its sports watch then anodises it to using tint zirconia beads to create a hard and scratch - proof outer layer			1
‘ we believe this aluminium alloy sets a new standard both in the way it performs and the way it looks , ’ @entity6 ’s senior vice president of design @entity53 said previously			1
the next generation iphones , which are expected to be called the @entity21 and @entity62 , are expected to be unveiled in september and may include a @entity64 chip and @entity65 , which also features in the @entity66			0
it ’s also possible that the @entity69 tech giant will release a four - inch version of the phone called the @entity72			0
days after the launch of the @entity2 , owners revealed they can be bent out of shape when stowed in a pocket			1
the handset is made from a combination of 6000 series anodised aluminium and stainless steel with titanium inserts , @entity77 reported			2
@entity6 polishes the aluminium used in its sports watch then anodises it to using tint zirconia beads to create a hard and scratch - proof outer layer addressing ‘ bend gate ’ after the phone ’s launch , @entity6 spokeswoman @entity87 said : ' with normal use , a bend in @entity2 is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale , a total of nine customers have contacted @entity6 with a bent @entity2			1
' tests showed that the phone bent out of shape under 100lbs of pressure - the same as the @entity101			0
but accusations of unintentionally bendy handsets have dogged @entity6 since 2012 , when some users claimed the @entity105 and later the @entity106 had a similar weakness			2
the reason for the bend is due to the @entity2 and @entity105 6 plus being made out of aluminium			1
aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so , if enough pressure is applied , it will bend and move			0
according to @entity116 , no part of either of the new @entity115 has more than a quarter of an inch ( 0.64cm ) of aluminium in any spot			0
this means that , in areas of the phones that are weakest , it ’s possible it could be susceptible to bending			0
this is noticeable in images , with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the sim card slot			0
these areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and sim card , so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend			2
to stop the phone bending , users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone			0
for example , do not have it sideways in a pocket , as your pocket will push it against your leg , possibly causing bending			0
putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect , so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option			0
another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied .			0

rumours *suggest* @entity6 will used 7000 series aluminium in the next @entity2
alloy is already used to make sports bikes and the @entity15
would make next handset 60 per cent stronger than the @entity2 6 's case
just days after its launch the handset was shown to be easily bent
