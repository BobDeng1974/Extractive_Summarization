by common consensus , @entity0 was rinsed by @entity3 winger @entity2 during @entity5 ’s 2 - 1 defeat at the @entity6 last sunday			1
a day later he joined up with the @entity8 squad , preparing for a @entity10 qualifier against @entity11 on saturday and the friendly at @entity13 against @entity14 on tuesday			0
the idea was to protect this kid , to nurture one of the genuine talents in the game			0
instead we are hell bent on burning him out			0
a weary @entity0 was given a roasting by @entity2 at @entity3 on sunday @entity27 ' recovery time ( in days ) between matches at @entity30 last season : 7 , 7 , 15 , 9 , 12 , 31 , 7 , 8 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 17 , 10 , 4 , 7 , 3 , 11 , 7 , 22 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 30			1
his recovery time between matches for @entity5 and @entity8 this season : 6 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 10 , 7 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 10 , 3 , 6 , 3 , 5			1
for a 19 - year - old , making his way in the game after a £ 16m move from @entity30 in the summer , he is playing an awful lot of football			1
way too much football , as it happens			0
last year , when he was in and out of the @entity30 team , interchanging at right back with @entity44 , he played 1,821 minutes of first - team football in the entire season			1
four months into his career at @entity5 , playing for one of the top clubs in @entity8 and the national team ’s new right back , he has already played 1,535 minutes for club and country			2
last season , his first full season since he graduated from the academy at @entity57 ’s , @entity27 averaged a game every 12.5 days for @entity30			1
this is his recovery time , in days , between games at @entity30 last season : 7 , 7 , 15 , 9 , 12 , 31 , 7 , 8 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 17 , 10 , 4 , 7 , 3 , 11 , 7 , 22 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 30			1
those spells out of the team gave @entity27 time to recover , allowing his body to develop and to acclimatise to life as a top class professional athlete			2
this year , playing for a team that had ambitions to win either the @entity70 or @entity71 at the start of the season , he gets a game every 4.6 days on average			1
here is @entity27 ’ recovery time , in days , as an @entity5 and @entity8 player between matches : 6 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 10 , 7 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 10 , 3 , 6 , 3 , 5			1
he is being played round the clock for club and country			0
@entity2 tries to spin away from @entity27 ' during @entity3 's win at the @entity6 chambers on his @entity8 debut against @entity88 in september - he has now won three caps since he played in the 3 - 0 victory over @entity91 in the @entity92 at @entity93 on august 10 , @entity27 has appeared in 16 @entity5 games			1
five of them have been in the @entity71			0
throw in his @entity8 debut , a nine - minute appearance against @entity88 on september 3 , and the figure rises to 17			0
then add on his first start against @entity103 at @entity93 , plus the trip to @entity105 a few days later and we ’re up to 19			0
before @entity27 arrived at @entity5 in the summer , he had made 25 appearances in his entire professional career : 24 last season , trading places with @entity44 when @entity112 saw fit , and one the year before			1
he was at @entity113 on tuesday , playfully patting his @entity8 team - mate @entity115 ’s stomach and teasing him about his summer excesses			0
a dejected @entity27 walks off alone as @entity117 celebrate their equaliser in the 3 - 3 draw 2013 - 14 - @entity30 matches : 24 minutes played : 1,821 2014 - 15 - @entity5 and @entity8 matches : 20 minutes played : 1,535 @entity115 , also 19 , has played a lot of football , too			1
after breaking into @entity30 ’s first team he made 28 appearances in his first season			2
last year , before his £ 31m move to @entity128 , he played 41 times for @entity30			2
at the time he looked like he could go on for ever			0
this season , after travelling to the @entity130 with @entity8 , he has struggled to recover from injury			0
it will take time to rediscover his best form			0
@entity27 has to be given time too , particularly after his punishing schedule for @entity5 and @entity8			1
think back to a time when @entity139 was coming through at @entity140 in the mid-nineties and it is a world away from the demands being placed in front of @entity27			2
@entity139 was used sparingly at first , called into the @entity8 squad with @entity146 before @entity147 to train with the team and give the pair experience of the elite level			0
@entity27 leaps above @entity151 for @entity30 last season , when he had much more recovery time the idea , a brainchild of @entity156 , was to show two promising players what is in front of them if they continued to develop			1
both went on to have long and enduring careers for club and country , but too much is being asked of @entity27 at such an early stage of his career			2
naturally he wants to play , but there is no time to learn when he is being asked to play at the very highest level of the game , on average , every 4 - and - a - half days			2
think back to august , when he was voted @entity5 ’s player of the month and looked assured and accomplished in the heart of that defence			0
with the right guidance , he can play like that every week			0

@entity0 is playing too much football and it is burning him out
he played 24 times last season - already this term he has 20 appearances
@entity27 had much more recovery time at @entity30 than at @entity5
he played on average every 12.5 days at @entity30 - now it 's every *4.5* days
@entity27 endured a torrid game against @entity2 on sunday in @entity5 's 2 - 1 loss at @entity3
