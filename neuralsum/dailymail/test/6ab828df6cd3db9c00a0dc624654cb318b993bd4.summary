@entity0 has insisted that @entity1 will not be sold this summer , even if he fails to agree a new long - term contract at @entity3			2
but as we 've seen in the past - with @entity6 's move to @entity7 a prime example - that sort of promise is n't always kept			0
here , @entity11 takes a look at five possible destinations for the @entity15 man			0
@entity1 , pictured in training on thursday , has attracted interest from a number of big clubs @entity20 the @entity21 have a genuine interest in the @entity24 wonderkid and believe they have the financial capabilities to pull off a mega-deal			1
but when push comes to shove , can they emerge victorious in what could turn out to be an auction ? @entity1 has rejected a contract worth Â£ 100,000 - a - week and could look to force a move away from @entity24 @entity32 the big question is how would @entity1 fit into @entity35 's plans given his wealth of attacking talent			1
but when the best players become available , the best clubs are always in the market			0
it is no different with the @entity42			0
@entity43 will also be a major pull for @entity1			2
@entity45 city are always in the market for the best @entity48 talent as they try to keep up with homegrown quota regulations			0
@entity1 will , perhaps , be the best available @entity48 player in the market this summer			2
expect @entity45 to make their move early in the transfer window			1
@entity24 boss @entity0 has insisted that the club will not sell @entity1 this summer @entity54 would @entity1 do it ? would @entity24 sell to @entity54 ? it would certainly a bold move should he join @entity24 's fiercest rivals			1
they certainly have the finances to make a deal happen			0
@entity54 are looking for superstars this summer			0
this would be a super transfer			0
@entity64 @entity65 is understood to be a big fan of the 20 - year - old			1
but would @entity1 be up for playing abroad at such an early stage of his career ? if he is , then expect @entity64 to be in the running for his signature this summer			1
@entity64 boss @entity65 is believed to be keen on @entity1 and could make a move for him			1

@entity1 could leave @entity24 in the summer transfer window
@entity20 and @entity45 are both interested in signing him
@entity32 could make a big money move if @entity1 becomes available
@entity64 boss @entity65 is believed to be an *admirer*
