@entity0 insisted he did not want @entity1 to leave the @entity2 , at a lunch in @entity4 @entity1 faces being ‘ governed by fax ’ from @entity7 and reduced to the standing of @entity9 if it leaves the @entity2 but stays in the single market , the prime minister said yesterday			1
at a lunch in @entity4 @entity0 insisted he did not want @entity1 to leave the @entity2			1
and he warned the ‘ @entity9 option ’ of simply having access to the single market would lead to ‘ government by fax ’ , with @entity1 unable to influence the @entity2 ’s laws			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t want @entity1 to leave the @entity2			1
i think that we benefit crucially from the single market and i think it is worth understanding what leaving would involve			0
‘ you can be like @entity9 , and you can have full access to the single market , but you have absolutely no say over the rules of that market			2
’ @entity9 is a member of the @entity30			0
this grants it access to the single market , but it is obliged to respect the laws of the free trade area			0
it last held a referendum on full @entity2 membership in 1994 , when it was narrowly rejected , but anti-eu attitudes have hardened in recent years			2
mr @entity0 said there was now a ‘ settled will ’ in @entity1 for ‘ quite significant reform ’ of the relationship with the @entity2			1
but his comments came as the president of the @entity47 said @entity1 needs to make up its mind whether it wants to stay in the @entity2 or not			1
in a sign of growing @entity2 frustration with @entity1 , @entity51 effectively warned @entity53 critics of @entity7 to put up or shut up – suggesting the @entity1 should quit if it was not ‘ comfortable ’ with the rules of the 27 - nation club			1
mr @entity51 said : ‘ it is good for the @entity2 to have @entity1 on board , provided of course @entity1 is comfortable with the situation			1
award : @entity61 and @entity51 @entity2 plan ' like tantric sex ' ‘ no country is obliged to be in the @entity2 – we are a free association of free countries			2
‘ now it is up to @entity1 to decide if it wants to keep its position or not			0
’ his comments will pile pressure on mr @entity0 to give in to demands from @entity53 mps and stage an in / out referendum on @entity76			0
but in a blow to the prime minister ’s strategy of renegotiating the terms of @entity1 ’s membership , @entity2 home affairs commissioner @entity77 yesterday warned the @entity1 would not necessarily be allowed to retain @entity2 co-operation on some areas of justice policy if it opted out of others			2
@entity53 mp @entity87 welcomed mr @entity51 ’s intervention , adding : ‘ when even the arch euro - federalist @entity51 realises we need to make up our minds about membership of the @entity2 it is extraordinary that the government continues to run scared of a referendum			1
’ former @entity53 defence secretary @entity96 argued mr @entity0 ’s renegotiation strategy would not be seen as credible unless it included the threat to leave			0
he said : ‘ we should set out what our relationship ought to be and make clear to our @entity76 partners that if a consensus can be reached , our continued membership of the @entity2 could be the recommended course of action			2
‘ equally , if we were not given such assurances , then we have to be clear that the @entity1 people might well decide to leave			0
’ in a speech , dr @entity96 added : ‘ to be frank , if the choice is between the current trajectory towards ever closer union and leaving , then i would choose to leave , albeit reluctantly			0
if the choice is between a looser , more economic relationship and leaving , then i would choose to stay			0
’ mr @entity0 also said yesterday a deal on the deadlocked negotiations over the @entity2 ’s long - term budget was only achievable if @entity7 backed down on its demands for an inflation - busting increase			0

he warns : ' we will have absolutely no say over the rules '
@entity51 : ' @entity1 needs to make up its mind whether it wants to stay in the @entity2 '
