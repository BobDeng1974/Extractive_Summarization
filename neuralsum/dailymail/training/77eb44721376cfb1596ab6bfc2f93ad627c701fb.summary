president @entity1 has appeared to criticise the men , who were locked up for more than 12 years in the @entity13 detainment camp in @entity16 , saying they lacked a work ethic			1
but the men are equally disappointed with their new lives - with one telling the press they had simply swapped one prison for another			1
the men arrived in @entity22 in december , after @entity23 said his country would take them in and help them get resettled			1
the six , who were detained as suspected militants with ties to @entity29 in 2002 but were never charged , were cleared for release in 2009			1
but they were stuck in @entity9 for the next five years because they could not be sent home - and no one wanted them , until @entity5 stepped into the breach			1
it offered them a residential facility to study @entity37 , learn about @entity5 culture and integrate to their new home - which has about 300 @entity42 residents out of a total population of 3.3million			0
a labour union was drafted in to help find the men work , but it has since said the men have turned down jobs they have been offered			2

but he returned from his visit despondent			0
on his radio programme he said the former detainees are far from the ancestors of @entity5 , who he described as gritty , hard - working immigrants			2
' if these people were humble people of the desert , poor people , they 'd surely be stronger and more primitive , but they 're not , ' @entity23 said of the former prisoners			0
' through their hands , features and family histories , it seems to me that they 're middle class			1
' his comments have not been universally welcomed			0
senator @entity89 , of the @entity90 , defended the men wednesday , tweeting : ' the @entity9 six were jailed for more than 10 years in dreadful conditions			1
' the psychological damage must be terrible			0
making them work now ? premature			0
' his comments about their state of health appear to be backed up by lawyers working for the six men			0
@entity101 , of @entity103 @entity102 , told the @entity104 last month : ' my client [ @entity105 ] has lost ability to walk after 13 years in @entity9			2

while at @entity9 , @entity105 was at the center of a legal battle in @entity137 courts over the military 's use of force - feeding			2
when he arrived in @entity5 , he was reportedly weak as a result of repeated hunger strikes			0
in recent videos , @entity105 appears thin but not overly so			0
