by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 12:52 est , 14 march 2013 a @entity2 firm has unveiled radical plans to launch a space shuttle from the top of an @entity7 passenger jet			1
@entity8 says the system will be a far cheaper way to launch satellites - and says it can sell launches for £ 7m , around a quarter of the price currently charged			1
the firm claims its system , which could launch satellites weighing upto 250kg , could take to the air in 2017			1
once it reaches this height the shuttle is released and its jet engines kick in to take it to an altitude of 80km , when the satellites are put into orbit and the shuttle glides back to earth the @entity8 launch model uses an @entity21 , an aircraft already certified for zero gravity flights , to take the shuttle up to 10,000m on its back			2
once it reaches this height , the shuttle will be launched to take it to an altitude of 80km , when the spaceplane doors open and put the satellites into orbit			0
once this operation has been completed , the shuttle will return to earth by gliding towards its launch airport - and can be reused			2
' our launch programme benefits from the input of technologies previously developed and certified through original partnerships between major players in the aerospace sector such as the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , @entity57 , the @entity58 and @entity59 , ' said the founder and ceo of @entity26 , @entity62			0
an @entity21 which @entity26 will use to launch its space shuttle an artist 's rendition of an @entity26 satellite , which the firm says can be launched for around £ 7m , far cheaper than current solutions the firm also plans to build its own spaceport in @entity70 , although says in theory it could launch from any airport			1
other countries , such as @entity74 and @entity75 , announced during the launch that they would be partnering with @entity26 in order to build spaceports in their countries too and discussions are under way with several other potential partners			2
the system is likely to face competition from @entity86 's @entity85 , which has announced plans for a version of its @entity85 space system , called @entity90 , that could also deliver satellites into orbit at low cost			0
it has produced a design that will be air - launched from @entity85 ’s carrier aircraft @entity96 , the same mothership that will launch the company 's @entity99 on suborbital passenger flights			0

@entity26 claims it can launch satellites for £ 7m - a quarter of the current price
