the ' @entity1 ' card from @entity2 not only promised weeks of unlimited pasta , but a look into why the chain is fighting to hold onto customers			1
the @entity8 - themed chain sold the $ 100 card last month that allowed 1,000 people to dine on endless pasta , breadsticks , soup and salad for 49 days			1
the passes sold out in less than an hour , with some turning up on @entity16 for hundreds of dollars			1
it was a successful publicity stunt for @entity2 's parent company , @entity18			2
but the company 's troubles are n't over : it 's fighting to hold onto customers , with sales at its flagship chain declining for each of the past three years			1
and a hedge fund last month sent shareholders a 294 - page treatise criticizing @entity18 's management as part of a push to take control of the board at the company 's annual meeting on friday			1
this image provided by @entity18 shows @entity2 's @entity38			2
' the @entity8 - themed chain had just announced to let 1,000 people pay $ 100 for the pass that gave them unprecedented free reign to its pasta			1
the passes sold out less than an hour after they went on sale online			1
( @entity44 photo / @entity18 ) @entity18 says it 's making changes to turn around business			2
that includes modernizing its menu with ' small plates ' like crispy risotto bites and updating its marketing			2
to get a firsthand look at @entity2 's troubles , i paid for a @entity38			2
i mostly enjoyed my meals , but the reactions of my companions shed some light on why the chain is struggling			1
some think the menu is overwhelming and the service is slow			0
others feel bad about eating all the empty calories			0
and one colleague who ordered the meat lasagna said : ' i can make this at home			0
' the food @entity2 has become a punchline in some circles that do n't see it as serving authentic @entity8 food			1
one night , i asked my fellow diners what they thought about the criticism			0
@entity80 , 40 , said he considers @entity2 's food to be ' @entity82 ' and likes the consistency it provides			0
i found the food to be tasty too , if basic			0
my main complaint is that the noodles are on the soft side , but others might not prefer their pasta @entity91			1
the bigger issue is nutrition ; my go - to dish of corkscrew pasta with meat sauce and meatballs probably was n't the best option			1
the dish is 920 calories			0
@entity2 did add a ' @entity101 ' two years ago with options that include a chicken breast served with potatoes and spinach at 550 calories			0
but those are n't part of the pasta promotion			1
that does , however , bring me to another problem @entity2 has : an overwhelming number of options			0
executives acknowledge the need to simplify the menu , which has been criticized for mushrooming to nearly 100 items , including burgers			1
still , @entity18 president @entity119 recently said it 's hard deciding what to get rid because ' everybody has their favorite			0
' the prices the other common complaint among my companions was that the prices are too high , with dishes like @entity131 costing $ 18 in @entity132			1
a steak and potatoes dish cost $ 30			1
@entity2 notes prices vary by market but that in most places , those dishes cost $ 9.49 and $ 19.99 , respectively			2
still , @entity2 acknowledges it needs to get better at offering value			0
in fact , the @entity1 was intended to promote its @entity139 , which lets people eat as much pasta as they want in one sitting for $ 9.99			1
that promotion has run every year since debuting in 1995			0
like other aspects of its business , though , @entity2 has acknowledged that it has n't been as effective as it could be			0
as a result , the promotion was pushed to late september this year , instead of early august			0
@entity147 , @entity2 's executive vice president of marketing , said @entity2 realized the idea of a hot bowl of endless pasta is n't as appetizing when it 's hot out			1
the @entity139 is @entity2 's most popular deal , but i never saw it advertised in the restaurants			0
that 's likely because the chain does n't want to distract customers who are likely to pay more for something on the regular menu			2
while it may make sense from a business perspective , it was inconvenient and confusing			0
i had to look up the options for pasta , sauce and toppings available on my phone or ask the waiter			2
another problem ? the @entity139 made @entity2 's regular prices in @entity132 seem more inflated			0
just a single plate of pasta and meat sauce costs $ 17 on the regular menu			1
a waiter told me on one visit that a man at a nearby table was on his seventh bowl , so maybe he got his money 's worth			0
but @entity2 said about a third of people do n't even ask for a second plate .			2
