@entity0 are monitoring developments with @entity3 midfielder @entity2			1
the @entity5 man did not travel with the club to @entity7 on @entity8 as he protects his hamstring injury			1
however , clubs have become aware that he has grown frustrated following the lack of talks over a revised contract			0
the 24 - year - old only joined @entity3 from @entity16 in 2013 for £ 13million and signed a five year deal			1
it is understood that was linked with incentives and @entity21 has since hinted that he would discuss new terms with the player to reward his performances			0
his troublesome hamstring injury has been sorely felt by the team as well as the player this season			0
his importance has been widely recognised by team - mates and other @entity42 clubs have taken keen notice			0
@entity44 is only 16 years old , but has impressed at @entity45 @entity46 wanted to buy him in january and were willing to go to £ 20m but they are wary @entity3 will refuse all offers and do n't want to become engaged in a saga hence looking at other targets			1
@entity0 have similar reservations but like the player and will see how events develop			0
head of recruitment @entity53 was a big admirer of @entity2 during his time at @entity57 and watched the midfielder regularly while he was playing for @entity16			1
@entity0 are in the process of re-shaping their squad and are looking to offload midfielders but believe @entity2 would fit into @entity63 's pressing style should he be willing to make the move			1
@entity46 , meanwhile , have had an opening offer for @entity45 midfielder @entity44 rejected			1
the 16 - year - old also has an offer from @entity68			0
@entity69 has made a bid to bring @entity44 to the @entity71 , but it was rebuffed @entity72 are showing an interest in @entity26			1
the @entity27 striker is a target for @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity0			1
city have played down their chances of signing the @entity81 star but it is understood the club 's hierarchy are keen on a £ 25m transfer			0
@entity72 are scouring @entity86 for potential new strikers to back up @entity88 while rumours also persist that the @entity90 may yet move on in the summer			2
@entity91 is also expected to return to @entity92 from his loan at @entity72 where he has scored four goals in 13 appearances			1
@entity72 are also favourites to sign @entity96 from @entity97 although @entity98 , @entity92 and @entity27 remain interested			2
@entity26 , pictured ahead of @entity27 's game at @entity100 on @entity8 , is interesting @entity72 @entity46 and @entity77 have checked on @entity102 striker @entity101			1
the 21 - year - old was offered to @entity104 for £ 3.5m last summer but they were unsure about taking a gamble on a young forward from @entity107 who was untried in the @entity110 leagues			0
the @entity111 forward , who is looked after by @entity114 's former agent @entity113 , has scored six goals in his last six games and is now rated in the £ 12m bracket after helping propel @entity102 to fifth in @entity118			2
@entity77 scouts are looking for forwards who fit into their profile of being quick , technically good and able to play a pressing game			2
their budget at this stage means a loan is more likely for january if anything with permanent deals shelved until the summer			2
@entity102 would be reluctant to sell @entity128 in january unless clubs made an inflated offer			2
@entity101 is in form at @entity102 , and @entity46 and @entity77 are both said to be interested @entity98 expect @entity132 to resume talks over a loan deal for @entity135 over the coming days			1
@entity132 want a loan with view to a £ 12m deal for the @entity139 but have also asked about taking @entity140 from @entity141			2

@entity98 are awaiting news on their bid for @entity148			0
@entity150 's officials are in @entity151 and will return to @entity152 on sunday			0
they want @entity98 to increase their offer for @entity148 while @entity98 will then decide whether to loan him to @entity104 or @entity155			2
@entity135 ( right ) is expected to resume talks over a loan deal to @entity132 in the next few days @entity77 's highly - rated defender @entity158 has signed for @entity159 on loan and will be joined by team - mates @entity161 and @entity162			1
@entity158 , 19 , was initially signed from @entity163 and is tipped to make a breakthrough at centre - back while @entity161 , 21 , a former trainee with @entity0 , is a full back who can play either side			1
@entity162 , 20 , can play across the forward line			0
@entity77 's highly - rated defender @entity158 has signed for @entity159 on loan @entity171 spent last thursday training with @entity92 at @entity173 before visiting @entity76 but the growing belief is that @entity175 may have persuaded him that they could be his best option			1
their youth system is renowned and guarantees a quickfire progression into the first team			0
@entity171 and his father are considering , understandably , whether moves to bigger clubs would stagnate his progress			0
he is already playing in the first team and is a @entity186 international at 16			0
