by @entity0 a @entity2 mother says it was a pair of 9 and 10 - year - old neighborhood boys who ran to her rescue and instructed her how to perform cpr on her two - month - old son after hearing her desperate cries for help			1
when @entity11 ’s son @entity10 abruptly stopped breathing on monday afternoon she was sitting home alone and in her panic lost her cell phone , and as she immediately felt , any chance of calling 911			1
' i was sitting in the living room with the baby and i noticed that he was off that day			0
he seemed kind of non-responsive to my smile			0
something did n't feel right			0
at that point i put my finger under his nose and realized he was not breathing , ' she told 11alive			0
across the street in @entity47 was 9 - year - old @entity30 and 10 - year - old @entity31 tossing a football			1
though the woman ’s cry initially scared the boys , they obeyed before going one more step further			0
' i said even if it 's a burglar we still need to help because it 's the right thing to do , ' recalled @entity30			1
as @entity31 called police and waited on the ambulance outside , mrs @entity11 said @entity60 raced inside to her , a boy she had never met before , and realizing what was wrong directed her on what to do			1
instructors : the two boys say they not only called 911 for the woman but rushed over to instruct her on how to deliver cpr to the infant after seeing a how - to poster at school ' i told her to push on the baby 's chest five to 10 times with only two fingers , tilt back the baby 's head , plug the baby 's nose and breathe into the baby 's mouth , ' said @entity30			1
' he said it so confidently that i just listened to him right away , ' the mother said			0
seconds later , the baby started streaming			0
' he screamed but i told her that that 's a good sign because the baby 's breathing , ' @entity30 said			1
an ambulance arrived moments later with @entity31 guiding them in			2
recognition : after a few seconds the baby began breathing again , saving its life according to the mother but deserving no more than a thanks according to the boys ' if the little boy had n't shown me how to do the compressions right here ... my baby would not be alive right now , ' she told @entity103			1
' and i am incredibly grateful			0
' the boys say they learned cpr after memorizing the steps seen on a poster hung in their elementary school 's cafeteria			1
' we just wanted to know if case it happened , but we never knew we 'd have to do that , ' said @entity31			2
' we did n't care if we were on the news , ' said @entity30			2
' we just cared about saving the baby			0
' mrs @entity11 says @entity10 later spent two nights in a hospital while diagnosed with sleep apnea			2
