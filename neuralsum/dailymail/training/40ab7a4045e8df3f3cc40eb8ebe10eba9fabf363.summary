it ’s certainly a reason to call it ‘ cattle class ’			0
train passengers get less space than livestock when being transported , it was revealed today			2
the government has assumed that non-seated train passenger occupies 0.25m2 of floor area - about the size of a sofa cushion			2
now more than 1,700 new train carriages for services in @entity14 and the @entity74 are being built with the thinking that four people can occupy every m2 of standing space			2
but @entity80 animal welfare regulations say that at least 0.3m2 must be given to calves and adult goats when transporting them , reported @entity84			0
@entity86 sheep weighing less than 55kg ( 8st 9lbs ) should have the luxury of between 0.3m2 and 0.4m2			0

in a bitter blow for passengers , it was announced last week that fares will rise by an average of 4.1 per cent in january , far higher than the pay rise that the majority of workers can expect			0
over the past decade , the cost of many annual season tickets for the growing number of workers who commute into @entity14 has risen by more than 50 per cent			2

‘ there is now more competition in the skies , particularly with the recent launch of @entity40 's @entity117 , which is operating several domestic routes			0
more competition usually means better prices for flights			0
