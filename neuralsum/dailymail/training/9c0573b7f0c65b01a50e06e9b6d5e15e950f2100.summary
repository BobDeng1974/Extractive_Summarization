@entity0 , known as @entity0 , seemed to be a healthy young woman when a health inspector knocked on her door in 1907 , yet she was the cause of several typhoid outbreaks in @entity6			1
@entity0 was the first ' healthy carrier ' of typhoid fever in the @entity9			1
it all began in the summer of 1906 , when @entity6 banker @entity11 took his family on vacation			0
the @entity14 hired @entity15 to be their cook			0
soon afterwards , one of the @entity11 's daughters became ill with typhoid fever			1
then , mrs @entity20 and two maids became ill ; followed by the gardener and another of the @entity24 ' daughter 's			0
in total , six of the eleven people in the house came down with typhoid			2
legendary : known as ' @entity0 ' , @entity0 was the first person identified as a carrier of typhoid bacilli in the @entity9			1
herself immune to the disease , she spread typhoid while working as a cook in the @entity6 area main staircase : nurses ' building			0
one of the oldest buildings on campus , this is where " @entity44 " @entity0 was known to socialize during her later years on the island dormitory : it was thought that an abundance of sunlight and fresh air would aid in recovery from pulmonary tuberculosis ; this theory was never tested at @entity53 , where the tb pavilion was left derelict beauty : main street during summer			1
this was the main thoroughfare for the island 's automobiles during its years of operation ; now , the road is covered with dirt and vines western street : this street led to the morgue ( pictured right ) and physical plant ( pictured left ) on the island , as well as to the chapel , which collapsed many years ago @entity71 : @entity72 on @entity53 had a complete physical plant which supplied all steam heat and electricity for the island @entity76 has made 17 trips out to @entity72 on @entity53 in the @entity78 , beginning in 2008			1
his fascination with forgotten abandoned places led him to become fascinated with the island some 5 years prior , and he spent that time making the connections necessary to make the trips happen			2
he now boasts a collection of over 5,000 photos taken out on the island			0
a curated selection of these images is available in print at @entity88			0
additionally , @entity76 has published a widely read history of the island on his blog , @entity0 could not understand how someone who was not sick could spread the disease , so she went on the run			1
eventually she was captured and forced to live in isolation upon @entity53 , a particularly treacherous stretch in @entity6 's @entity78			1
@entity0 was taken by force and against her will and was held without a trial			2
she had not broken any laws , yet the government locked her up in isolation indefinitely			0
@entity72 , was the name of the facility on the island where she was kept			2
it treated everything from smallpox and leprosy to venereal disease and heroin addiction			0
the island has been abandoned since 1963 , but more than a dozen buildings remain , in various states of disrepair			0
@entity0 was presumed to have infected some 51 people , three of whom died , over the course of her career as a cook			1
she died after a total of nearly three decades in isolation			2
auditorium , @entity121 : last used as part of a public school that was a part of a failed drug rehab program on the island , this auditorium was abandoned half a century ago , in 1963 western staircase in winter , @entity128 : broken out windows on each landing let snow into the building gantry crane : this is where the ferry from the @entity137 terminal would dock once or twice a day , to bring people and supplies to the island , and people and bodies away nurses ' building in winter : one of the oldest remaining structures on the island , the @entity146 is in rough shape ; several floors and portions of floors are inaccessible to those unwilling to jump across voids in the floors cast iron staircase : one of the more unique and surprising architectural features on the island , this cast iron staircase linked the three contiguous floors on the @entity158 ( oldest ) portion of the @entity145 ' building @entity0 did not understand a lot about typhoid fever and , unfortunately , no one tried to explain it to her			1
though commonly known at the time that typhoid could be spread by water or food products , people who are infected by the typhoid bacteria could also pass the disease from their infected stool onto food via unwashed hands			1
for this reason , infected persons who were cooks , like @entity0 , were the likeliest to spread the disease			1
in february of 1910 , a new health commissioner decided that @entity0 could go free as long as she agreed never to work as a cook again			1
@entity0 accepted the conditions and agreed that she would take hygienic precautions to protect those with whom she comes in contact with from infection			2
however , she was unable to find work that was as well paid as a chef and @entity0 eventually went back to working as a cook			2
five years later , in january 1915 , the @entity187 in @entity188 suffered a typhoid fever outbreak			1
twenty - five people became ill and two of them died			2
bedroom , @entity193 : @entity195 ' cottage is among the oldest buildings on @entity53 , and potentially hazardous to the health of anybody who decides to climb about in it key to the past : oxidized copper keys and chemical stalagmites on windowsill , @entity205			0
because it is so hard to reach @entity53 without the permission of the @entity209 , many artifacts remain in situ operating room , @entity128 : the newest building on the island , the tb pavilion was built to feature medical facilities that were state - of - the - art in 1939 ; the island was then abandoned for the first time , and it was never used corridor , @entity128 : the most recently constructed structure on the island , the tb pavilion is in wonderful shape - there 's barely any significant structural damage bathroom , @entity193 : the entire southern wall of this bathroom has collapsed , leading to wonderful lighting in the bathroom an investigation found that a recently - hired cook , mrs. @entity230 , might be to blame			0
it was , of course , @entity0 , using a pseudonym			0
there was little public sympathy for @entity0 because she knew at this time she was a healthy ' carrier ' of the virus			1
it was suggested that she willingly and knowingly caused pain and death to her victims using a pseudonym made even more people feel that @entity0 knew she was guilty			1
she was sent to @entity53 for a second time to live in the same isolated cottage			0
for a further 23 years , @entity0 remained imprisoned on the island			1
@entity128 : with a combination of @entity252 grants and @entity6 money , a new , state - of - the - art facility for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis was built on @entity53 morgue : this room served as the morgue for @entity72 , in the building that ' @entity44 ' @entity0 trained to be a pathological assistant in , and where upon her death an autopsy confirmed that she had live typhoid cultures in her gall bladder wraparound porch , @entity146 : the porch in the rear courtyard of the @entity145 ' building demonstrates the diverse architectural modalities of the building , which was constructed in stages over more than a decade gymnasium , @entity121 : when @entity72 was repurposed from a quarantine hospital to a drug rehab , a school was hastily constructed out of the old @entity121 corridor , @entity275 : when the primary purpose of @entity72 became as a detention facility for juvenile drug offenders , the @entity121 was re-purposed as a school the entire island is a captivating place for photographers like @entity76			1
he has made 17 trips out to @entity72 since in 2008			0
@entity76 admits he has a fascination with forgotten and abandoned places and has now taken 5,000 photos on the island			0
' it is a singular experience stepping off a boat onto the shores of @entity53 - almost like stepping half a century back into time			0
and this makes sense , because the island was fully abandoned in 1963			0
i can not , in my photography or in my historic research , begin to describe the smells of the various parts of the island or the feeling of walking into the room where ' @entity44 ' @entity0 first trained as a pathologist and ultimately was autopsied in			2
i can not explain what it 's like to feel the adrenaline rush as i edge along the roof of the @entity146 to reach a room that no stairs connect to any longer to get a photo , or the frustration at being unable to penetrate the one room in the @entity311 where the lock has rusted shut , virtually wiping the room off the grid			0
' what i hope to communicate with my photos is - as best i can - a sense of what it 's like to step back in time , to a place with a marvelous history			0

@entity0 , was the first person in the @entity9 identified as a carrier of the pathogen associated with typhoid fever
she was presumed to have infected some 51 people , three of whom died
forced to live in isolation on an island in the @entity78 by public health authorities she died alone
new pictures more than 100 years later capture the nature of the facility where she was quarantined
