@entity1 ’s @entity0 has admitted he allowed himself a smile when @entity3 scored a late goal for @entity5 on sunday			1
in derby week , that is something you do not hear very often			2
for @entity1 boss @entity0 , however , the @entity10 goal that turned three @entity12 points into one at @entity14 was perhaps the best moment of a week that underlined @entity1 ’s uncertain form once again			1
having let a two - goal lead slip to draw in the @entity22 at @entity23 last tuesday , @entity0 ’s team subsequently lost at @entity19 in the @entity20			1
ahead of wednesday ’s @entity25 tie at home to @entity27 , @entity1 still search for consistency			1
at that moment i thought the game was finished and i went to drink a glass of water			2
when they told me after how the game finished i smiled			2
’ that is as close as @entity0 is likely to come to a show of emotion , in public anyway			1
nevertheless the @entity42 knows that , with @entity5 to come at the @entity44 on sunday , his team are fortunate to be only six points behind @entity12			1
‘ this year maybe we are playing in irregular form , ’ he said			2
‘ maybe some parts of the game are well , and others not so well			2
the @entity20 champions dropped points in the title race after losing 2 - 1 at @entity19 on saturday @entity0 admits being pleased after @entity3 scored a late equaliser against league leaders @entity12 ‘ we are always clear that we need to improve and we are thinking about the best way to do it			1
‘ it ’s very difficult to analyse the whole of last season and compare with just some games of this season			0
last year we had one point less than we do this year			0
we did n’t start so well as i wanted last year either			0
‘ i think it ’s important to have some clean sheets			0
as a team you play easily or you play with more trust when you do n’t concede any easy goals at the beginning			0
‘ but we must improve in general , not just the defending			0
we must create more chances , we must score more goals			0
we are working on that and i am sure we will return to be the same team we were in the most important part of last season			0
’ @entity77 was pictured back in training with @entity1 's squad following his groin injury as often with the city manager , there was some contradiction in his message on tuesday			1
what he was clear about , however , was his team ’s need to win on wednesday , on sunday and then at home to @entity23 in the @entity22 next week			1
he said : ‘ i think we must win the three games			0
they are three important competitions			0
’ city welcome back forward @entity77 into their squad for the @entity27 match after a month and a half out with a groin problem			1
meanwhile , @entity0 has paid little heed to news that @entity5 striker @entity98 had been limping this week ahead of sunday ’s game			1
‘ we really do n’t change our way to play for one player , ’ he said			0
‘ if it ’s not @entity98 it will be @entity103 , @entity104 or @entity3			1
they have so many creative players			0
we can not prepare for a game talking about one player			2
