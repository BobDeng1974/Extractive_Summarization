by @entity0 - jones published : 13:23 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 13:23 est , 15 january 2014 the @entity2 has sparked fears amongst residents on his estate that he is planning to mine under their homes by invoking an ancient right			2
the colourful aristocrat claims he has the right to the minerals under vast swathes of west @entity16 , which he argues dates back to when the title included a much larger area of land			1
much of the land has since been built on or sold off but lord @entity23 is claiming his @entity25 , which boasts @entity26 , held on to the mineral rights for whatever is underneath the ground			1
' controversial ' aristocrat : the @entity2 has raised fears he is planning to frack on his estate after invoking an ancient right			0
he argues that the rights to the minerals under a vast area of west @entity16 date back centuries council officials have responded by informing worried villagers how to contest the claim and tried to reassure them that fracking or mining is not an immediate concern			1
@entity46 , town clerk in @entity47 , @entity16 , said fracking had been raised as a concern because the area is close to the @entity50 which has been mooted for possible test drilling			2
however , she added that lord @entity23 's application is a legal technicality and he would need to be granted a licence to extract gas			1
@entity56 ( pictured ) is on lord @entity23 's 9,000 acre estate along with @entity26			1
but the aristocrat has applied for mineral rights to a larger area of land they argue was ' vested in the land owner centuries ago '			0
' residents have expressed worries that following recent publicity these letters have been sent out in order for the rights owner to have access to the mineral rights for the purposes of fracking			0
' @entity74 makes it clear that any oil or gas belongs to the @entity78 , not to the owners of the land , and they would have to grant licences to extract them			0
' she explained that until 2002 , interests in mines and mineral rights existed but did not need to be recorded on the @entity86			0
' however , following the @entity88 , the interests needed to be recorded by october 12 , 2013 , in order to be protected , ' she said			0
' @entity56 believes the interest in the mineral rights has been in the ownership of the family for hundreds of years and has registered this interest accordingly			0
' residents on the @entity56 estate ( pictured ) are worried that lord @entity23 plans to begin fracking as the area is close to the @entity50 which has been mooted for possible test drilling			1
council officials are advising them on how to respond she continued : ' they are not seeking to create any new rights , but to protect existing ones , â €			2

lord @entity23 made an application to assert his right to land around @entity47 , @entity16 before @entity107
residents are now worried that he plans to mine vast swathes of land
council officials have *stressed* the application is only ' a legal technicality '
