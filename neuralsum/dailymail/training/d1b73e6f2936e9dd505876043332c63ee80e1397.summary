a city 's independent traders are launching their own currency to boost local businesses and prevent it becoming another victim of ' @entity5 '			1
organisers hope the @entity8 pound will stop big companies and bankers swallowing up cash that is desperately needed by hard pressed local firms			1
over 100 business have already signed up to accept the new currency , which goes into circulation in may , including a family bakery , local theatre , dozens of small cafes and @entity19 brewed @entity20			1
the currency has been launched in @entity8 to help the local economy and prevent big companies ' hoovering up ' cash from local trade notes will printed in £ 1 , £ 5 , £ 10 and £ 20 denominations , with one @entity28 worth exactly £ 1 sterling			1
consumers can open an account with the @entity32 , which is administering the scheme			2
this money can then either be cashed for the notes or used electronically to pay bills online or even with a mobile phone			0
the currency has the backing of the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) and will have the same protection as any other deposit account			1
@entity42 , the director of the @entity28 , said the scheme hoped to keep cash in the city			2
he said : ' this will be money created by the people of @entity8 for the @entity8 people			1
' @entity50 companies just hoover up money from a local area			0
' massive shops with massive marketing and advertising budgets can easily wipe out local businesses			0
' money goes into their financial system and typically out into @entity60 and into the offshore sector			0
' we 'll be driving to get more money going to independent traders , to ensure we continue to keep the diversity of our city			1
keeping it local : the @entity8 pound will be available in several denominations and will help retain the ' diversity of the city ' ' one of the reasons people love living here is because it 's got a massive number of diverse , independent traders			1
' sometimes we do n't realise what we 've got until it 's gone			0
' the whole town clone town @entity81 has n't yet happened in @entity8 yet , but there have been a lot of independent firms that have struggled			1
' we have seen the shutters go up in and around @entity8			1
' we also hope that visitors to the city will change a bit of money while they are here			2
' it 's a serious goal , but it will also be a bit of a novelty and fun for tourists			0
' the organisers are holding a competition to help design the new notes , although they have already created a logo , and produced security features to counter forgery			0
there is a silver hologram design , a gold foil strip with serial numbers embedded and other features which are impossible to reproduce			0
@entity105 ( corr ) , leader of @entity107 , said : ' this is a chance to demonstrate the economic resilience of the city			2
' we want to make it as easy as possible for people to use the @entity28			0
' the @entity114 was the first to launch , in @entity115 in 2006 and has 70 traders involved			0
eighteen months ago @entity117 , in @entity118 , starting printing its own currency , but to date no more than 30 firms are taking the money .			2
