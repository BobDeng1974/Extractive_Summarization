@entity1 @entity0 even travelled to @entity2 to take part in an @entity5 - style clash between @entity6 and @entity2 quiz champions we 're about to watch @entity0 ’s finest hour			1
he flicks on the dvd and there he is — all gleaming smile and big hair — flanked by a brace of matronly women			2
he ’s notching up the points so smartly on a quiz show called @entity19 that his fellow contestants look mildly stunned			1
@entity0 ’s score is unfeasibly high			1
he seems to have acquired several thousand points			2
he carries off a ( relatively modest ) £ 500 , but this is 1996 ; a gentler era , before tv quiz shows became ferociously competitive and offered bonanza prize money			1
@entity0 is on a winning streak with @entity19			1
the following week he comes back and trounces the opposition again			2
kerching ! another £ 500 drops into his lap. ‘ @entity19 was a quiz show with a difference , ’ he says			1
‘ the host , @entity34 ’s brother @entity33 , read out the answer and you had to supply the question			2
i blasted through , knocking the reigning champion off her perch			2
’ @entity0 , 64 , does not look like the archetypal quiz nerd			1
he has the aura of a @entity43 pop star			2
but do not be deceived : his brain is a veritable compendium of trivia , and he has the fastest trigger finger since @entity48			2
he is also , it emerged last week , @entity6 ’s most prolific quiz show contestant , having made 28 appearances on tv game shows over the past 30 years			1
the @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 : these are just a sample of the shows on which he has competed			1
he has faced a panoply of star hosts from @entity64 ( ‘ my comedy idol ’ ) to @entity69 ( ‘ very pleasant ’ ) , @entity65 ( ‘ terrific ! ’ ) and @entity66 , @entity67			2
‘ luckily i have the hide of a rhino , ’ says @entity0 , a comedian and entertainer			1
‘ @entity67 did n’t intimidate me one bit			2
‘ i ’m used to performing — after all , it ’s my day job — and i was expecting a bit of flak from her			2
‘ when i was voted off she said : “ oh , so @entity0 , you ’re a comedian			1
that was n’t very funny , was it ? ” i ’d have liked a bit of banter with her , but i did n’t get the chance			2
’ keeping up appearances : quiz show master @entity0 on the set of @entity65 in 1990 , left , and on @entity87 , right through the ages : @entity0 's appearance on @entity90 in 1986 , left , and @entity55 in 2008 , right his most recent appearance , broadcast last week , was on a show called face the clock , hosted by impressionist @entity94			1
it was n’t all glamour , however			2
‘ the auditions for @entity93 were in a freezing cold warehouse in @entity99			2
you have to answer questions against the clock , but you ’re not told when the time will run out			2
i lost by a split second , narrowly missing the £ 1,800 jackpot			2
’ @entity0 , alas , has endured an infuriating number of such near - misses			1
he has won a relatively modest £ 5,000 in prize money over the years , though when critics carp that this makes him more vanquished than victor , he points out that surmounting the hurdle of the audition is a triumph in itself			1
he says his job helps him keep cool under fire			0
he works in clubs , pubs , on cruises and as an after - dinner speaker , and never gets stage fright			0
he also has instant recall and the memory of an elephant			1
‘ most contestants are nervous , but i never am , ’ he says			0
‘ there are auditions before every show and you have to come across as confident and knowledgeable			1
’ his top subject is @entity43 pop music , and by golly , he ’s good			0
not only is his brain a compendium of every hit song of the decade , he also recalls bogglingly obscure facts			0
‘ i know @entity137 used a @entity139 t - 60 bass amplifier and i can remember the registration numbers of @entity143 ’ road managers ’ cars			0
’ but how good is his general knowledge ? i fire a couple of questions from the @entity149 ’s fiendish @entity148			0
‘ @entity150 was an early potential title for which novel of 1883 ? ’ he answers correctly : @entity154			0
‘ which instrumentalist might play a rimshot ? ’ he ’s right again : a drummer			0
@entity157 : @entity0 racking up the money on @entity159 , hosted by @entity94 trivia - mad : @entity0 in his first television appearance with presenter @entity162 on @entity87 in 1982 dedicated : @entity0 , pictured here appearing on @entity65 with @entity65 in 1990 , says he would liked like to be a quiz show host himself the one subject that often stumps him is sport			1
‘ i do n’t follow players , managers or teams			0
i do n’t even know the star players of my local football team , @entity171			0
’ @entity0 is self - taught — he was encouraged to leave his @entity173 grammar school by teachers , who felt he was more interested in his pop band than studying			1
actually , they were only half - right			0
@entity0 did love music and performing			1
his mum , @entity178 , ‘ a frivolous type who loved dancing ’ and worked at the @entity182 in @entity173 , encouraged him			0
‘ she said to the manager : “ let my nipper sing			0
” so i went on the stage			0
it was my first gig			0
’ but he also had a thirst for knowledge			0
‘ my dad , a carpenter , taught me to love books , ’ he says			0
i absorbed information like a sponge			0
but my teachers said i had the attention span of a gnat			0
’ he got into quiz shows by default when he auditioned for tv talent contests @entity202 and @entity203 , and failed to get on			1
friends teased him for knowing a lot of useless information			0
‘ i thought : “ i ’ll show them			1
i ’ll try a quiz show , ” ’ he says			1
human encyclopedia : @entity0 has made 28 appearances on quiz shows in the past 30 years his first appearance was in 1982 on @entity213			1
hosted by the perennially popular @entity162 — @entity0 ranks him ‘ the ultimate quiz show host ’ because of his geniality , clarity of diction and the speed with which he rattled through questions			1
in its heyday , the show drew 20 million viewers			1
@entity0 was on sparkling form			1
he even beat a fellow contestant , a vicar , on the buzzer with a @entity227 question			1
what was it ? ‘ in the @entity231 , @entity230 was beguiled by what ? ’ he recalls			0
he leapt in so swiftly with the correct answer , a serpent , the vicar was left pink with embarrassment			0
four years later , he was invited to fly to @entity2 for a @entity213 : the @entity5 contest			1
‘ the two weeks in @entity239 was a prize in itself			0
’ also picked for the gb team was the accomplished quizzer @entity242			0
‘ she sat by the pool studying lists , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t do any swotting			0
you ca n’t revise , because you never know what ’s going to come up , do you ? ’ in the event , however , @entity248 ’s mugging up paid dividends			0
he encountered her again in 2008 on @entity55			0
@entity0 still kicks himself over the question that lost him the contest ; a tricky one on @entity255 films			1
‘ people watch at home and say “ oh it ’s easy			0
i could answer that ” , but it ’s a different ball game when you ’re in the studio			1
it can be nerve - racking , ’ he says			0
@entity0 , who has two daughters and four grandchildren , lives in @entity266 , @entity267 with his @entity269 - born wife @entity268 , 59			1
‘ and no , i ’ve never asked her to take my speeding points , ’ he quips , referring to @entity270 and his @entity269 - born wife			0
he is never short of a wisecrack , and would rather like to be a quiz show host himself — but not on one of the more cerebral shows			1
he says there is a quiz show hierarchy , and @entity280 , @entity281 are considered the elite			1
he auditioned for the latter , and did n’t get on			0
and it irks him when he encounters ‘ big - headed ’ sorts on shows			1
modest : despite all his appearances , @entity0 has won only £ 5,000 over the years ‘ sometimes you come across university types who can be annoyingly boastful			1
you hear them listing the shows they ’ve been on and it can intimidate the more nervous contestants , ’ he says			1
@entity0 has rarely been flummoxed , though last february in @entity296 , he did have a moment of madness			1
‘ the question was “ what do you call something that provides a steady income ? ” and , of course , the answer was a cash cow			0
but it was so easy i thought it was a trick question			0
it was my first dumb answer			0
’ even contestants with nerves of steel can become jibbering wrecks under pressure			0
i wonder if @entity0 has a favourite			1
‘ one contestant was asked to name a bird with a long neck			2
he said : “ @entity320			0
” ’ during his three decades as a quizzer , he ’s seen prize money shoot up and competition become fiercer			0
getting onto a show like @entity325 is a costly , time - consuming exercise			2
‘ a friend spent £ 1,000 on phone calls before he qualified for the show			2
then he did n’t get past the “ fastest - finger ” question — which is something silly such as “ how many rivets are there in the @entity333 ? ” he was quite miffed			2
’ @entity0 may be approaching his bus pass years , but his memory is still as sharp as a tack			1
‘ i have n’t had any senior moments yet , ’ he says			0
‘ besides , older people have had time to acquire a breadth of knowledge			0
actually , they make the best quizzers — so perhaps my best years are yet to come			2
