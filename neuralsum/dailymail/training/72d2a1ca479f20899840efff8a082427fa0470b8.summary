by @entity0 silly putty : one of the world 's most popular toys and now , also , a novel way to make your phone hold a charge for longer ? that 's according to a group of researchers in the @entity12 at the @entity13			1
they 've developed a way to use the material found in the toy and surgical tubes to make lithium - ion batteries that last three times longer between charges compared to the current standard			1
a team of researchers from the @entity13 have created a lithium - ion battery that they say lasts three times longer the current industry standard using material found in @entity1			1
pictured is the silicon polymer and battery used for the research the team created silicon dioxide ( @entity34 ) nanotube anodes for lithium - ion batteries and found they had over three times as much energy storage capacity as the carbon - based anodes currently being used			1
@entity1 was one of the most popular toys of the 20th century , a result of an ' accident ' during the @entity43			2
it was invented by engineer @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 in 1943 as he was attempting to create a synthetic rubber			0
the result was not able to replace rubber - but its unusual qualities , the ability to flow like a liquid , bounce like a ball , or break given a sharp blow , made it a popular toy			2
by 1987 , two million @entity1 eggs were sold every year			2
the mass is composed of 65 per cent dimethyl siloxane ( hydroxy - terminated polymers with boric acid ) , 17 per cent silica ( crystalline quartz ) , nine per cent @entity60 ( castor oil derivative ) , four per cent polydimethylsiloxane , one per cent decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane , one per cent glycerine , and one per cent titanium dioxide			0
the researchers say this has significant implications for industries including electronics and electric vehicles , which are always trying to squeeze longer discharges out of batteries			0
' we are taking the same material used in kids ' toys and medical devices and even fast food and using it to create next generation battery materials , ' said @entity86 , the lead author of a paper on the research			0
the paper , @entity90 of @entity91 as @entity89 for @entity92 , was published online in the journal @entity94			0
it was co-authored by @entity96 , a mechanical engineering professor , @entity97 , an electrical engineering professor , and several of their current and former graduate students : @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
the team originally focused on silicon dioxide because it is an extremely abundant compound , environmentally friendly , non-toxic , and found in many other products			1
silicon dioxide has previously been used as an anode material in lithium ion batteries , but the ability to synthesize the material into highly uniform exotic nanostructures with high energy density and long cycle life has been limited			1
there key finding was that the silicon dioxide nanotubes are extremely stable in batteries , which is important because it means a longer lifespan			1
specifically , @entity34 nanotube anodes were cycled 100 times without any loss in energy storage capability and the authors are highly confident that they could be cycled hundreds more times			2
the researchers are now focused on developing methods to scale up production of the @entity34 nanotubes in hopes they could become a commercially viable product			0

team from the @entity13 have created a longer - lasting battery
they used the material found in @entity1 to get three times more charge
the researchers used a *modern* variant of silicon dioxide , found in the toy
with this they created new non-toxic battery nanotube anodes
they say the tech could be used in phones , cars and more in future
