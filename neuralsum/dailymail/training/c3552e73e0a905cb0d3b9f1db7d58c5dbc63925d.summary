by @entity0 published : 13:32 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 13:44 est , 12 december 2012 from super-size doors to reinforced wheelchairs , everything is larger than life			0
this is one of the @entity7 ’s first dedicated weight loss wards , where last year four surgeons performed more than 600 operations to try and help clinically obese patients			1
based at the @entity12 , the ward is at the heart of one of the fattest places in the country , where more than 40 per cent of adults are overweight			1
at 47 stone , he was too big to wash himself at home or even fit through his bathroom door it 's a case of desperate times calling for desperate measures			1
patients who come to the ward are generally treated with extreme surgery , such as gastric bands , sleeves and balloons to reduce stomach size			2
and with obesity and its related illnesses expected to cost the @entity38 £ 50 billion each year by 2050 , it 's thought many more units will open across the country going forward			1
@entity12 's ward has been captured in the new @entity43 documentary @entity20 , which follows the stories of patients seeking surgery at the hospital and explores possible reasons behind their weight gain , the reality of gastric surgery and what it means for them – plus the challenges faced by the staff who work there			1
@entity21 is one of the largest patients the unit has ever treated			1
and too heavy for a reinforced ward bed , the hospital has been forced to hire another one at £ 150 a day in the programme , consultant surgeon @entity60 is brutally honest about why the patients are there			2
‘ there is no medical problem that is causing people to be obese , ’ he says			0
‘ the vast majority of people are obese because their calorie intake over time has not matched their calorie burn			0
the usual patient we get has been trying all the diets under the sun and all the medicines under the sun and they ’ve failed			0
and they ’re just crying for their life back			0
’ one such person is @entity21			1
he is so fat that he ca n’t fit through his own bathroom door – and he ’s too big for even a reinforced hospital bed			0
the 29 - year - old weighs a whopping 47 stone – only ascertained by using industrial strength scales			1
housebound for over a year and with his life at serious risk , during the show the father - of - two is admitted for an indefinite stay to be put on a controlled diet , with a view to surgery if he can lose some initial weight			1
when he married 10 years ago , @entity21 had a slimmer figure			1
right : everything on the @entity20 is big - from double - sized doors to reinforced wheelchairs at 47 stone , he is one of the biggest patients the unit has ever treated			1
and too heavy for even a reinforced bed , the hospital has been forced to hire another one for him at a cost of £ 150 a day			0
he said : ‘ at the moment i feel like my weight ’s just eating my life			2
if i do n’t do anything now i just feel like i ’m not going to be here			0
’ during the programme consultant surgeon @entity60 explains : ‘ we ’re bringing him in to get him to confront his addictive behaviour			0
he ’s almost pathologically obese , but why ? ’ and with no sign of any significant weight loss within the first few days , the staff suspect that @entity21 is buying crisps and fizzy drinks from the hospital trolley			1
with @entity21 ’s stay in the @entity20 costing the @entity38 £ 250 a day , they are forced to confront him about his commitment			2
@entity120 ( left ) was 26 stone and wheelchair - bound until she went to the ward			1
after a gastric sleeve procedure she can walk again until she went to the ward , 47 - year - old @entity125 , weighed 26 stone			1
wheelchair - bound and suffering from raised cholesterol , high blood pressure and diabetes , her husband @entity126 had become her carer			2
during the course of the documentary she shed four stone to prove her commitment to making permanent changes to her diet			2
after undergoing gastric sleeve surgery , which reduced her stomach by 7/8ths , her @entity125 ’s diabetes improved rapidly and she is now able to walk unaided with just a walking stick			0
she said : ‘ it ’s unbelievable			0
i just never , ever thought i would get down to this weight again			2
’ dr @entity60 adds : ‘ if we get the right people , 98 per cent who go for surgery will succeed			0
’ with the high cost of medication for obesity - related illnesses such as diabetes , asthma , high cholesterol and high blood pressure			0
' gastric surgery costs about £ 8,000 … if we get them ( the patients ) off the medicines , we recover the cost of the operation in less than two years			0
' ‘ @entity20 is on @entity43 on wednesday at 8pm .			0
