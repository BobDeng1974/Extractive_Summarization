@entity0 , @entity1 , is the home of swagger			1
so it is fitting that two men with perhaps the most impressive struts in @entity7 football will go head - to - head just a stone ’s throw away at @entity11 next month			2
@entity1 against @entity12 in the @entity14 quarter - finals means only one thing : @entity16 versus @entity17			1
@entity16 , the self - styled @entity18 , and @entity17 , the man who said : ‘ i do n’t need the @entity19 to know i ’m the best			1
’ time to deliver : @entity16 's @entity1 side have been drawn against @entity12 in the @entity14 , which means he will be up against one of his former players , @entity17 mutual respect : @entity17 , left , and @entity16 worked together while the pair were at @entity25 here i come : @entity17 will be aiming to knock @entity1 out of the @entity14 with @entity12 will @entity27 and @entity28 be big enough for the both of them ? we are about to find out thanks to friday ’s draw			1
we know they can work together , having seen them forge a strong bond during their time in tandem at @entity25 — so much so that the @entity38 wrote in his autobiography : ‘ @entity16 would become a guy i was basically willing to die for			1
’ but what happens when these two heavyweight egos exchange blows ? @entity16 will certainly fancy his chances of seeing @entity1 qualify for a third consecutive @entity7 semi-final			1
speaking before yesterday ’s draw , he said : ‘ the most difficult opponents you can get in @entity7 football are all in the draw			2
maybe all the teams want to face us			0
‘ @entity1 are maybe the biggest outsiders … maybe us and @entity54			1
@entity38 talent : @entity17 , seen here with @entity12 midfielder @entity57 , is one of the best strikers in @entity59 on current form giving direction : @entity16 shouts instructions to @entity63 at the @entity64 in 2008 ‘ you have the two finalists from last season ( @entity68 and @entity69 ) ; you have the two @entity71 giants ( @entity70 and @entity72 ) ; you have @entity73 , a fantastic team over the last couple of years and you have @entity12			1
‘ maybe they look at us and @entity54 , because they are not having a great season , and consider us the two clubs they all want			0
’ @entity1 faced @entity12 in the group stages in 2004 - 05 , drawing 0 - 0 at home and winning 3 - 0 away			1
the @entity83 ’s mind games have become a feature of his second stint at @entity11 — with his assertion that @entity1 are not serious title contenders , despite being top of the @entity90 , the most baffling of all			1
@entity16 seems intent on doing everything to relieve pressure on his players			1
he will no doubt insist @entity12 are favourites to win the tie — and there is a strong argument to back that claim — but he will still fancy his chances			1
thanks to their @entity102 owners , @entity12 ’s squad is one of the most expensively assembled on the continent			1
however , as @entity1 ’s @entity106 can testify , money can not buy everything			1
having spent a fortune , the @entity108 still had to wait nine years and endure numerous nights of heartbreak before @entity14 success in @entity113 in 2012			0
silver service : @entity1 owner @entity106 finally got his hands on the @entity14 trophy in 2012 nine years after buying the club @entity119 clash : @entity17 , left , and @entity16 will go head - to - head when @entity12 take on @entity1 @entity12 have not gone past the quarter - final stage since 1995 , when they lost in the semi-finals			1
@entity16 , on the other hand , knows exactly what it takes to go all the way — as do his players			1
two consecutive @entity59 trophies prove that			0
so , in the end , this tie could be decided by two larger - than - life characters			2
can @entity16 ’s tactical acumen nullify @entity17 ’s threat ? or will the @entity38 ’s sheer talent be too much for @entity1 ? we are about to find out			1
meanwhile , get ready for those egos to be inflated just a little bit more @entity16 and @entity17 are no shrinking violets , so there is every expectation of fireworks now that these two are drawn on a collision course , writes @entity146			1
on the @entity1 job : ' if i wanted to have an easy job i would have stayed at @entity150			2
beautiful blue chair , the @entity14 trophy , @entity153 , and after @entity153 , me			0
' on @entity153 : ' he must really think i ’m a great guy , otherwise he would not have given me so much			0
he must have a very high opinion of me			0
' on his ability : ' please do n’t call me arrogant , but i ’m @entity7 champion and i think i ’m a special one			0
' on nicknames : ' i am the only one who has won the three most important leagues			0
maybe instead of the ‘ @entity18 ’ , people should call me the " only one "			0
' on his looks : ‘ if they made a film of my life , i think they should get @entity167 to play me			0
he ’s a fantastic actor and my wife thinks he would be ideal			0
’ on trials : ' @entity171 asked me to have a trial with @entity174 when i was 17			0
@entity17 does n’t do auditions			2
' on versatility : ' i can play in the 11 positions because a good player can play anywhere on the pitch			0
' on injury : ' an injured @entity17 is a pretty serious thing for any team			2
' on what to get his wife for her birthday : ' nothing , she has @entity17			2
' on being marked by @entity190 : ' first i went left , he did too			0
then i went right , and he did too			0
then i went left again , and he went to buy a hot dog			0
' on @entity16 : ' @entity16 is a big star			2
the first time he met my wife he said : " @entity196 , you have one mission			0
feed @entity17 , let him sleep , keep him happy			2
" he says what he wants			0
