by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:26 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 18:02 est , 26 february 2013 panic spread through @entity4 stock markets yesterday as political paralysis in @entity6 sent shares tumbling			1
the @entity8 fell 84.93 points to 6270.44 , wiping £ 21.5billion off the value of @entity12 ’s blue chip firms			1
the losses were worse on the @entity14 with the stock market down 4.9 per cent in @entity16 , 3.2 per cent in @entity17 , 2.7 per cent in @entity18 and 2.3 per cent in @entity19			1
bank shares were the biggest fallers			0
@entity22 and @entity23 lost more than 4 per cent			0
the cost of borrowing surged in @entity6 and the cost of insuring the country ’s debt against default climbed to its highest this year			2
choice : the split between the centre right forces of @entity33 ( left ) and the centre left forces of @entity36 ( right ) raised the real prospect of a fresh election the markets plunged across the world after the @entity6 election resulted in deadlock thanks to one of the largest protest votes in living memory			1
the result in @entity6 is expected to slow the country 's recent economic gains , and threatens to tip the entire eurozone back into full - blown crisis mode			1
in a rejection of the austerity reforms needed to ease the country ’s massive debt , more than a quarter of voters backed the @entity56 , led by comedian @entity57			1
meanwhile , the disgraced former prime minister @entity33 unexpectedly exploded back on the scene with 29.2 per cent of the vote			1
@entity62 tabloid newspaper @entity61 expressed its horror at the election result and renewed instability in the financial markets with the headline , ' are they going to destroy our euro now ? ' mr @entity57 's anti-euro and anti-austerity party , which took 25.6 per cent of the votes , was the most popular single party in @entity6			1
the @entity56 drew support away from both major parties , leading to the prospect of months of deadlock as politicans attempt to form a new government			2
the centre - left groups , led by @entity36 , had 29.5 per cent of the vote in the lower house , only just ahead of mr @entity33 's centre - right alliance			1
mr @entity57 took to the internet to taunt the country 's mainstream politicians over their disappointing performance			0
' we 've started a war of generations , ' he said in a statement posted on his website			0
' they are all losers , they 've been there for 25 to 30 years and they 've led this country to catastrophe			0
' the charismatic anti-politician , who was once convicted of manslaughter , has vowed not to join a coalition with any other party , meaning politicians face deadlock in their attempts to form a government			0
looking positive : @entity56 leader and comedian @entity57 and his wife @entity106 ' the winner is : @entity108 ' was the headline in @entity110 , while commentator @entity111 wrote in @entity112 : ' the " non-party " has become the largest party in the country			2
' despite mr @entity57 's success , a coalition between the centre - left and centre - right could be the most likely outcome after mr @entity33 this morning suggested he would consider teaming up with mr @entity36 , saying that both parties ' must be prepared to make sacrifices ' and rejecting the possibility of fresh elections			1
the centre - left was left in a state of shock by the results after failing to achieve the resounding win it had been expecting			2
@entity130 , a senior member of mr @entity36 's party , insisted that his grouping should be first in line to try and form a government , while the leader said : ' we will handle the responsibilities that these elections have given us in @entity6 ’s interest			1
' turnout was unusually low at 75 per cent - historically , it has usually been above 80 per cent , though this is the first national election held during winter			0
plunge : @entity142 markets were the first to fall today , sparking a global sell - off of shares after the election mr @entity36 is guaranteed a majority in the lower house , the @entity147 , due to election rules giving the largest alliance more than 50 per cent of the seats			1
but the situation in the @entity152 is much more confused - mr @entity33 's group is likely to be the largest with 116 seats , with mr @entity36 close behind on 113 , but no party is close to a majority			1
the party headed by current prime minister @entity158 , who has emphasised the need for radical economic reforms and continued austerity , performed disappointingly , attracting just 10.6 per cent of votes			0
mr @entity158 took over the government in november 2011 , with the support of both major parties , and pulled @entity6 back from the brink of an @entity168 bailout by restoring investor confidence and lowering the interest rate on the country 's bonds , which was unsustainably high			2
this split raised the prospect of a fresh election – and further delay to much - needed economic reforms in the single currency ’s third largest economy			2
competition : @entity158 casting his vote - mr @entity158 's party is expected to gain fourth place mr @entity36 , who was widely considered the favourite , has a reformist track record and has worked closely with mr @entity158 , leading to hopes that he would continue along the same path			1
however , the election results mean that if he is to have any hope of power he will depend on either mr @entity57 or the mercurial mr @entity33 , who are likely to reject the austerity demanded by the @entity62 government and other international lenders			2
if investors begin to doubt that @entity6 will enact reforms to keep its economy on track , the damage will quickly spread to other @entity4 countries , amidst fears that @entity6 is too large for an @entity168 bailout			2
leading centrists in the country lamented the results - @entity205 , a former foreign minister who lost his parliamentary seat in the election , said : ' the worst is yet to come for @entity6			2
' @entity208 , global head of market economics at @entity211 , said today that the election result was likely to shave up to one per cent from @entity6 's growth rate this year			1
‘ there ’s no alternative to the austerity that the @entity168 wants , ' he told @entity217 's today programme			0
' but the politicians are not going to offer that up on a plate because it ’s a recipe for rejection			0
‘ the @entity6 people are saying we do n’t want to do the hard yards			0
the news will have to get worse and a lot worse before it gets better			0
’ decisions : people read electoral information banners in a polling station in @entity234 during @entity6 's general elections as soon as results started to be declared last night , the euro began falling , reaching a seven - week low against the dollar by this morning			1
the single currency has rallied strongly in recent weeks as fears of an imminent break - up of the eurozone eased			0
but analysts said a change of government in @entity6 – and the possible return of mr @entity33 – could see the austerity measures implemented by outgoing leader mr @entity158 reversed and plunge the economy deeper into crisis			1
the @entity56 has come from nowhere in three years to secure the vote of one in four @entity6			1
its 64 - year - old leader , mr @entity57 , attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters as he toured town squares in a camper van			0
much of his support comes from young @entity6 , who are frustrated by never - ending corruption scandals and mobilised by social media			2
shock : opinion polls had underestimated the appeal of the @entity56 in the run - up to the election fragmented : seats in the @entity152 are allocated on the basis of the country 's regions earlier exit polls had shown the centre - left coalition ahead in both houses			1
but initial optimism from market investors soon evaporated once later projections pointed to a lead for mr @entity33 ’s centre - right coalition			1
the former premier , who resigned 15 months ago after bringing @entity6 to the brink of economic ruin , has made an astonishing comeback			0
his trial , on charges of paying for sex with an underage girl , has been postponed until after the election			0
mr @entity36 , a former communist , would have to win both houses to form a stable government			0
he has said he would continue with reforms begun by technocrat mr @entity158			0
the country is likely to endure political horse - trading over the next few days to try to appoint a government			0
if no party can form a majority , another caretaker technocratic government may have to take power until fresh elections can be held in may			0
@entity297 , of the @entity298 , said : ‘ under a scenario where the combined parliamentary representation of mr @entity36 ’s centre - left and mr @entity158 ’s centrists is insufficient to form a majority , a period of minority government followed by further elections would be likely			1
‘ such an outcome would place strong additional upward pressure on government borrowing costs			0
if this were to continue for a prolonged period , it could be destabilising for other distressed peripheral euro area countries			0
