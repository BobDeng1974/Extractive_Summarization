@entity0 and @entity1 will be asked to pay a £ 20m loan fee for @entity4 ’s @entity3 but both clubs have baulked at the price and will wait to see if @entity4 will do business on sunday			2
the 28 - year - old @entity9 striker wants to leave @entity4 after a year and hopes to join @entity10 - but the @entity12 club have thus far been reluctant to commit anymore of their summer transfer budget			1
if @entity3 ca n’t move to @entity10 he wants a loan move to keep open the option of moving to the current @entity17 holders			0
the player ’s wages are around £ 200,000 a week meaning the entire package comes to around £ 30m for a player who could leave after a year , making @entity1 and @entity0 extremely reluctant to do business at that price			1
however , @entity4 are determined to re-coup some of the £ 50m they paid for him last summer			0
@entity0 are most obviously in need of a striker , with @entity37 out until @entity38 , leaving @entity39 , who is as much a wide player as a centre forward , as their only experienced central striker			0
cover : @entity0 could be prepared to pay a loan fee following an injury to striker @entity37 in the market : @entity1 boss @entity46 could also make a move for the @entity9			2

@entity9 wants to leave @entity4 after a year and hopes to join @entity10
@entity0 and @entity1 waiting in the wings if @entity10 move falls through
@entity3 's wages are around £ 200,000 a week meaning the entire package comes to around £ 30m
