@entity8 shed 11st 7lb after promising a dying teenager she would join the bone marrow register after seeing it - and being deeply moved by the teenager 's blog - ms @entity8 decided she too would sign up to donate her stem cells and save lives			1

determined to fulfill her pledge , she even sent @entity14 a tweet , promising she would lose weight to join the register			1
@entity14 replied , urging her not to give up - and ms @entity8 has since lost 11st 7lb			1
she said : ' i thought @entity14 was incredibly brave and inspiring and when i read her tweet encouraging people to join the bone marrow register , i knew straight away that i wanted to do something for her			1
' being rejected was a turning point because here was this amazing young woman who was terminally ill yet doing all she could to help others – and i was just wasting my life being fat			2
' i could n't even walk up the stairs at work without becoming out of breath			0
now my weight was stopping me doing one thing for @entity14			2
' next week she will make a life - saving donation in memory of @entity14 , who died in january 2013			1
' @entity14 told me not to give up and i did n't want to let her down , ' said ms @entity8			1
' her amazing legacy can go on saving lives and i hope everyone reading this will donate as well – not for me , but for @entity14			2
' ms @entity8 's weight loss was inspired by the @entity10 , who was dying from cancer and urging people to join the bone marrow register			1
but at 25st , she was too fat - so tweeted @entity14 promising to lose weight ms @entity8 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , had battled with her weight for as long as she could remember - spending her teenage years wearing size 18 clothes			1
' i longed to wear trendy clothes like the other girls at my school but i could only shop in the ' fat ' section of shops , ' she said			0
by the time she married at 27 , she walked down the aisle in a size 28 wedding dress - but says she knew the five - year marriage was doomed			0
' in my heart i knew i was n't right for him and he was n't right for me			0
but i was a big girl and i told myself it would probably be my only chance to get married and settle down			0
i hoped we could make it work			0
' she went on to find love again - but blissfully happy with new partner @entity92 , she piled on even more weight			0
after four years together , by 2012 her weight had peaked at 25st and @entity92 's had rocketed up from 14st to 19st 8lb			0
' we were just so happy together , ' she says			0
' we enjoyed going for drinks and meals and cooking together , but it was always really high - calorie , bad foods			0
' ms @entity8 had battled with her weight all her life - and by the time she promised to join the register she was 25st with a @entity32 of 60 after meeting partner @entity92 , she piled on more weight due to the couple 's love of fatty food and drinks ogether they weighed a whopping 44st 8lb and attracted cruel insults wherever they went			1
but ms @entity8 , who works in a fizzy drinks factory , was still shocked when she tried to join the bone marrow register after reading about @entity14 and was turned down			1
to join the register , donors needed a @entity32 below 30 , but hers was 60			1
so she sent @entity14 a tweet that read : ' i promise to lose weight so i can join the register '			1
and to her total surprise , @entity14 tweeted back , saying ' please do it '			2
spurred on , ms @entity8 said : ' i told myself that this time i would lose the weight			1
but it felt like such an impossibly huge mountain to climb			0
' i wanted to lose 11st , so that meant more than half my body weight had to go			0
i wondered how on earth i could ever manage to do it			0
' the couple embarked on a weight loss challenge and between them , have lost 17st she joined a local @entity136 and swapped takeaways for vegetable stir - fries , salads and fresh fruit for chocolate bars and crisps			2
and as the weight slowly started to fall off , she continued to follow @entity14 on @entity144 as she ticked off all the wishes on her bucket list , which included meeting @entity147 and whale watching			2
' i followed her doing all the incredible things she had on her list and , like all her thousands of followers , i just thought her courage and bravery were amazing			0
' to keep on track , she decided that she too would write a list containing all the reasons she wanted to lose weight			0

' to speed up her weight loss , she began also took up running - and before long , partner @entity92 also joined the weight loss challenge			0
' there was some healthy competition between us , which definitely helped , ' said ms @entity8			1
' we had a scoreboard in the kitchen and whoever lost the least weight that week had to cook for the other			2
by last summer , she was able to cross off number 14 on the @entity192 - sitting in a deckchair			0
she said : ' it might sound a bit daft , but just to be able to sit down without worrying if i would fit into the chair or not felt really fantastic			0
' i 'd never been able to just sit down in a chair before because usually i would n't fit , especially if it had arms			0
' another milestone moment came when she was able to buy tights that were labelled ' one size only '			0
