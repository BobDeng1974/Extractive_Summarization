by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 05:07 est , 17 october 2012 federal agents have raided the @entity3 pharmacy linked to the widespread meningitis outbreak across @entity5 that has left 16 people dead and left more than 200 ill with the infection			1
agents from the @entity9 searched the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) in the @entity13 suburb of @entity14 , with officers from the local police department providing support			1
nearly 14,000 people nationwide are at risk of infection because they received injections from suspect steroid medications shipped to 76 facilities in 23 states			0
raided : the @entity9 searched the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) in @entity14 after at least fifty vials of steroids containing fungi linked to meningitis were discovered caution : the grounds of the pharmaceutical company 's headquarters were cordoned off as the agents raided the property outbreak : the @entity11 's products have been linked with the deadly meningitis outbreak across @entity5 which has left 16 dead the raid took place as calls came for an even wider probe into whether the pharmacy may have broken federal laws dealing with controlled substances , as additional meningitis cases were announced in the country			1
@entity47 , @entity5 attorney for @entity3 , said in a statement : ‘ i can confirm that this office and our law enforcement partners are investigating allegations concerning the @entity10			1
’ @entity53 said it was ‘ entirely premature ’ to speculate about what might be uncovered			0
@entity56 , a lawyer representing @entity11 , said the raid was unnecessary and that ‘ asking would have produced the same result			1
’ he added : ‘ it is difficult to understand the purpose of this search , since we have been clear that ( @entity11 ) would provide , and has provided , anything requested			1
‘ we 've been clear that warrants were n't needed			0
’ the entrance to @entity11 's headquarters was cordoned off with yellow tape as the agents searched the property into the night			1
the @entity9 's criminal unit , the @entity71 , is a team of agents with specialised knowledge and training to investigate violations of food and drug laws			1
it pursues about 1,200 criminal cases each year			0
long haul : agents and local police search the premises well into the night lethal : the raid was undertaken as the outbreak widens , with 231 confirmed cases across the country the raid came as a leading @entity5 lawmaker called for an investigation of whether the compounding pharmacy violated federal laws covering potentially addictive drugs			2
meanwhile , the @entity5 meningitis outbreak is widening			2
a 16th fatality was announced on tuesday , after the death of a patient from south @entity97			0
according to statistics released yesterday by the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , there are 231 confirmed cases of meningitis in @entity5 , 19 more cases than the previous figures revealed			0
experts believe the outbreak will get worse before it gets better			2
dr @entity107 , an infectious diseases expert at the @entity109 in @entity110 , said : ‘ we will see more patients reporting in ill and we 'll have to treat many more			0
’ the @entity9 on monday widened its investigation of the cause of the fungal meningitis outbreak to other drugs made by @entity11			1
product : pictured are the vials of the injectable steroid used to treat back pain made by @entity10 implicated in the fungal meningitis outbreak last week the @entity9 said that more than 50 vials of steroid treatments from @entity11 tested positive for a fungus that causes meningitis			1
infections have been detected within two weeks of a patient receiving the @entity11 - supplied medication methylprednisolone acetate , on average , and up to 42 days afterward			2
but anyone exposed to the vials of the steroid - used to treat back pain and other conditions - should be vigilant for health problems for several months , @entity100 officials said			0
local health authorities have contacted over 90 percent of patients who may have been exposed			0
although it remains unclear exactly how any medication could have been contaminated , federal regulators have come under criticism for failing to prevent the outbreak by closely regulating drug compounding companies such as @entity11 , which prepare medications for clinics and doctors largely outside federal oversight			1
the @entity9 has said the law does not give it adequate authority to do so , leaving regulation largely to the states			2
the pharmacies are owned by @entity151 , an engineer , and his brother - in - law @entity152 , a pharmacist who was in charge of pharmacy operations at @entity11			2
' it does seem like the agencies , both at the state and the federal level , may have been misled by some of the information we were given , ' @entity3 governor @entity155 said last wednesday			0
hopeful : @entity100 workers at the @entity165 hope that the raid of the @entity11 can help to control the widespread outbreak besides the meningitis cases , two additional patients have a different type of fungal infection from injections in their joints ( as opposed to back injections )			1
@entity3 democratic representative @entity175 , a senior member of the committee that oversees business , called on the @entity178 to investigate whether @entity11 violated federal laws designed to stem illegal activity in controlled drugs			2
the company already faces multiple investigations by the @entity9 and several states , but mr @entity175 's request could launch an even more serious probe involving the @entity187 , which oversees sales of potentially addictive or controlled drugs			2
the @entity9 said on monday it was looking into two other drugs produced by @entity11			1
the agency said it had received reports of a patient with possible meningitis who received an injection of a different steroid from the one found to have caused the deaths			0
it said on tuesday that one transplant patient was infected with a fungus after receiving a drug used in open heart surgery manufactured by @entity11			1
the @entity9 originally said two such patients were infected			2
investigation : @entity207 and his colleagues at the @entity100 are working round the clock to ascertain exactly how the outbreak of fungal meningitis began confirmed : the @entity100 have said they have found @entity212 , a type of fungi , in patients with meningitis another patient identified by the @entity9 received an injection of the steroid triamcinolone , also supplied by @entity11			1
on tuesday , @entity9 official @entity220 stressed that the two additional products had not been linked to confirmed infections			1
she asked doctors to contact patients injected since may to make sure they had no signs of infection			0
@entity11 said in a statement that it was reviewing the new information from the @entity9			1
the @entity9 has been inspecting the @entity11 facilities			1
@entity220 said that based on the condition of the plant and other factors , ' we really ca n't assure the sterility of these products			0
' the legal threat to @entity11 also mounted as more victims of meningitis filed lawsuits , including two filed by @entity241 residents this week			1
all but eight of the 23 states that received suspect medications from the @entity3 specialist pharmacy have reported at least one case of fungal meningitis			0
meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord			0
symptoms include headache , fever and nausea			0
fungal meningitis is not contagious			0
the outbreak has raised questions about how the pharmaceuticals industry operates as a whole in the @entity5 @entity11 engaged in a practice called drug compounding that is not regulated by the @entity9 , which generally oversees drug manufacturers			1
tragic : @entity263 , 67 , from @entity241 died of meningitis in september , weeks after being treated with steroids for back pain grieving : @entity263 's husband , @entity267 , received similar treatment at the same clinic where his wife was treated but said there was ' no evidence ' he had contracted meningitis in compounding , pharmacies prepare specific doses of approved medications , based on guidance from a doctor , to meet an individual patient 's need			0
a @entity282 investigation found that @entity11 solicited bulk orders from physicians and failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required under state regulations			2
state pharmacy regulators have said that @entity11 violated its license in @entity3 by not requiring patient prescriptions before shipping products			1
the states reporting cases of meningitis are @entity294 , @entity241 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity97 , @entity305 and @entity306			0
@entity263 , 67 , from @entity307 , @entity241 , is one of the victims of the infection			0
ms @entity263 's husband , @entity267 , received pain - killing injections at the same @entity313 - area clinic where his wife was treated shortly before her death			0
the grieving husband was forced to have a spinal tap to check to see whether he had been infected , but said there was ' no evidence ' that was the case .			0

agents from the @entity9 searched @entity10 ( @entity11 ) in @entity14 , @entity13
last week more than 50 @entity11 products tested positive for fungus which causes meningitis
experts expect outbreak to worsen before it gets better
