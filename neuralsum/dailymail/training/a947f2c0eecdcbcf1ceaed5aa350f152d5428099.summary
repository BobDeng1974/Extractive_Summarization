mr @entity15 first came to public attention in 2003 when former @entity38 prime minister @entity37 compared him to a concentration camp guard			1
a confirmed @entity6 federalist , he has previously demanded that the @entity18 sets @entity6 budgets and repeatedly demands more money for @entity11 - an attitude that would undermine mr @entity2 ’s efforts to secure a new deal with the @entity6			1
one insider told the @entity47 that picking mr @entity15 would be like returning to the centralising days of former commission president @entity48 , a bitter opponent of @entity10 attempts to reclaim powers from @entity11			1

they would feel he would be sensitive to their sensitivities on @entity26			0
’ one government source in @entity75 denied that mr @entity2 has settled on mr @entity3 as his chosen candidate but said : ‘ the question is : how do you stop @entity15 from winning ? in terms of making @entity26 more competitive , more flexible and if you want to stop tying businesses up in red tape , he is not the man			1
’ the prime minister told business leaders that he was determined to secure a ‘ yes ’ vote in a promised in / out referendum on @entity6 membership in 2017			2
warning : @entity87 said that @entity2 needed to change @entity10 's relationship with the @entity6 but he told the @entity90 annual conference : ‘ it is my judgment that our current consent of remaining inside the @entity6 is wafer - thin - we have not made the argument enough about why @entity26 matters			1

‘ i think that ’s absolutely crazy in a globalised economy , it ’s an anomaly , it ’s an anachronism , we should get rid of it			0
’ he added : ‘ i happen to think @entity2 has a massive chance now			0
he ’s greatly respected among leaders and he could say to his colleagues around the table that in the end , unless you give me what i need , i ’m afraid the @entity10 people are going to vote against			0
