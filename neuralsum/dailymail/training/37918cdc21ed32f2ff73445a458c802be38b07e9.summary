@entity0 continued their 100 per cent start to this season 's @entity2 with a one - sided victory at @entity5 on wednesday night			1
goals from @entity7 and a @entity8 double gave the current tournament holders a 3 - 0 lead at half - time which they did n't look back from			1
for @entity5 , the result was a nightmare which saw £ 16million summer signing @entity14 substituted at half - time after a dire performance			1
here , @entity19 's @entity18 gives his verdict on how the players performed			2
@entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity22 - 5.5 failed to convince when coming for crosses and found himself embarrassed by @entity26 ’s prod for @entity8 ’s second			1
@entity29 somewhat with super save when one - on - one with @entity7			1
@entity22 failed to convince once more when trying to dealing with crosses inside his box @entity32 - 4.5 allowed @entity7 the freedom of @entity5 ’s half at one point in the opening period by advancing too far forward and failed to get close to @entity8 for his header			1
@entity38 - 5 errantly tried to shepherd the ball back to @entity22 when it bounced off @entity26 for the third goal and crashed into the hoardings when @entity8 smartly side - stepped his sliding tackle by the touchline			1
@entity44 - 5.5 being caught out by a sublime pass from @entity46 is no disgrace but appeared an uncertain presence @entity49 - 5.5 attacking thrusts were limited and defensively @entity46 had the beating of him			2
over-stretched to cut out @entity8 ’s pass that set up @entity7 in the second half			1
@entity49 ( right ) struggled against @entity54 ( left ) throughout their battle at @entity57 @entity58 - 5.5 tried to get physical with @entity7 straight out the traps with a bodycheck			1
@entity61 failed to translate his energy into effective action			0
@entity64 - 5 swamped by @entity0 ’s carousel of midfield passers			1
@entity67 and @entity68 just a class apart			0
tried to unleash @entity5 ’s attackers with one swift pass forward but failed each time			1
@entity72 - 6 produced a fine shot from 18 yards that whistled narrowly past the post , probably via a deflection from the fingertips of @entity78			2
a very good show given this was his first start since september 9			0
@entity72 ( left ) impressed in his first @entity5 start since september 9 due to injury @entity84 - 6.5 willing runner all evening and @entity5 ’s brightest player			1
tested @entity78 with a dipping shot in the second half			0
@entity14 - 4.5 offered little as an attacking presence and sulked when things did not go his way			2
@entity93 looks nigh for him to start on the bench			0
@entity96 - 6 went closest for @entity5 with a crisp shot from outside the box that smacked the post			2
but failed to dazzle like he can			0
@entity14 ( right ) was woeful for the @entity101 up front and was substituted at half - time as a result substitutes @entity106 - 6.5 ( for @entity107 ’ ) @entity106 was silvery when he came on and did more than @entity14 in his first 10 minutes			1
@entity108 - 6 ( for @entity109 ’ ) , @entity111 - 6 ( for @entity110 ’ ) manager @entity113 - 6 held faith with @entity14 but went unrewarded			2
must consider altering tactics now			0
credit for picking @entity72 , at least			0
@entity113 ' faith in starting @entity14 was unrewarded as the striker provided a woeful display @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity78 - 6.5 beat away @entity64 ’s long - range shot in the first half but then looked shaky from the @entity5 captain ’s corner , juggling the ball			1
appeared to make a finger - tip save from @entity72 ’s effort but was not recognised by officials			0
@entity128 - 6.5 got in an early shove on @entity84 to mark his presence and was consistent			0
brought ball out of defence confidently			0
@entity133 - 7 young centre - back snuffed out danger like a defender 10 years his senior			0
@entity26 - 7 real determination from @entity0 ’s nuisance - in - chief to reach the ball for @entity8 ’s second ahead of @entity5 ’s players and was untroubled in the main by the hosts ' attack , neatly dispossessing @entity84 at one point			1
@entity26 ( left ) was largely untroubled by @entity5 and did well to help create @entity8 's second goal @entity147 - 7.5 offered a proper attacking outlet with bursts forward to pin back @entity32			1
defended soundly too , which sometimes is n’t the case			0
@entity54 - 8 simply beautiful pass to set up @entity7 and displayed the touches that made him one of the star ’s of the @entity155 for @entity156			2
even after a nasty cut to his face			0
@entity67 - 8.5 appeared effortless as he conducted the @entity0 midfield with pass after pass			2
dictated the flow of the game from the first minute			0
@entity67 ( left ) bossed the midfield for @entity0 , dictating the tempo with his array of passing @entity68 - 7.5 helped strangle the life out of @entity5 by keeping attacks flowing and tempo high			1
@entity171 - 7.5 starting because of injury to @entity173 , he showed he is more than just a stand - in			0
neat dribbles down the left and retained the ball consummately			0
@entity8 - 9 - @entity178 took his first with a brilliant header and showed striker ’s instincts by side - footing second inside six - yard box			2
broke at pace time and again			0
@entity8 doubled @entity0 's advantage with a brilliant looping header to cap off a brilliant display @entity7 - 8.5 celebrated his goal like a man who knew he would score			1
caressed the ball into the back of the net and was a constant menace with darting runs			0
substitutes @entity196 - @entity195 ( for @entity197 ’ ) , @entity199 - @entity198 ( for @entity200 ’ ) all came on when the match was won and barely broke a sweat			0
@entity7 was a constant menace throughout the match and set the tone by scoring @entity0 's opener manager @entity208 - 8 sent his gilded crop out with ferocity and little sympathy			1
will be pleased he saw out a 3 - 0 half - time lead against @entity5			1
referee @entity214 - 7 had no major decisions to make and correctly booked @entity67 for a crude bodycheck on @entity84			0
real boss @entity208 ( right ) got his tactics spot on and will be delighted with his side 's performance @entity220 laments first - half showing			2

@entity8 scored twice in *dominant* win for @entity0
@entity7 scored @entity0 's opener in @entity2 win
@entity14 was dire for @entity5 and was replaced at half - time
