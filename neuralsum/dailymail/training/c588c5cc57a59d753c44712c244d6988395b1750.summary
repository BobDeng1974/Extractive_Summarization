upset at president @entity4 's policies on @entity5 and @entity6 , members of @entity2 's ruling family are threatening a rift with the @entity8 that could take the alliance between @entity10 and the kingdom to its lowest point in years			1
@entity2 's intelligence chief is vowing that the kingdom will make a ' major shift ' in relations with the @entity8 to protest perceived @entity8 inaction over @entity6 's civil war as well as recent @entity8 overtures to @entity5 , a source close to @entity2 policy said on tuesday			1
prince @entity22 told @entity24 diplomats that the @entity8 had failed to act effectively against @entity6 president @entity25 and the @entity28 - @entity27 conflict , was growing closer to @entity29 , and had failed to back @entity2 support for @entity31 when it crushed an anti-government revolt in 2011 , the source said			1
' @entity2 does n't want to find itself any longer in a situation where it is dependent			2
' it was not immediately clear whether the reported statements by @entity22 , who was the @entity2 ambassador to @entity10 for 22 years , had the full backing of @entity45			2
the growing breach between the @entity8 and @entity2 was also on display in @entity10 , where another senior @entity2 prince criticized @entity4 's @entity50 policies , accusing him of ' dithering ' on @entity6 and @entity28 - @entity27 peace			1
in unusually blunt public remarks , @entity54 called @entity4 's policies in @entity6 ' lamentable ' and ridiculed a @entity8 - @entity58 deal to eliminate @entity25 's chemical weapons			1
he suggested it was a ruse to let @entity4 avoid military action in @entity6			2
' the current charade of international control over @entity25 's chemical arsenal would be funny if it were not so blatantly perfidious			0
and designed not only to give mr. @entity4 an opportunity to back down ( from military strikes ) , but also to help @entity25 to butcher his people , ' said @entity54 , a member of the @entity2 royal family and former director of @entity2 intelligence			0
inaction : the @entity2 say they are getting upset by president @entity4 's inaction in dealing with the conflict in @entity6 the @entity8 and @entity2 have been allies since the kingdom was declared in 1932 , giving @entity76 a powerful military protector and @entity10 secure oil supplies			1
the @entity2 criticism came days after the 40th anniversary of the october 1973 @entity82 oil embargo imposed to punish the @entity83 for supporting @entity28 in the @entity84			2
that was one of the low points in @entity8 - @entity2 ties , which were also badly shaken by the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity8			1
most of the 9/11 hijackers were @entity2 nationals			0
@entity2 gave a clear sign of its displeasure over @entity4 's foreign policy last week when it rejected a coveted two - year term on the @entity96 in a display of anger over the failure of the international community to end the war in @entity6 and act on other @entity50 issues			1
@entity54 indicated that @entity2 will not reverse that decision , which he said was a result of the @entity96 's failure to stop @entity25 and implement its own decision on the @entity28 - @entity27 conflict			2
picking sides : @entity58 president @entity109 , seen here with bin sultan , has sided with the @entity6 government in the conflict ' there is nothing whimsical about the decision to forego membership of the @entity96			2
it is based on the ineffectual experience of that body , ' he said in a speech to the @entity10 - based @entity123 on @entity8 - @entity124			0
in @entity126 , @entity8 secretary of state @entity125 said he discussed @entity76 's concerns when he met foreign minister @entity128 in @entity129 on monday			1
@entity125 said he told the @entity2 minister no deal with @entity5 was better than a bad deal			1
' i have great confidence that the @entity8 and @entity2 will continue to be the close and important friends and allies that we have been , ' @entity125 told reporters			1
prince @entity22 is seen as a foreign policy hawk , especially on @entity5			0
the @entity142 kingdom 's rivalry with @entity5 , an ally of @entity6 , has amplified sectarian tensions across the @entity50			2
a son of the late defense minister and crown prince , prince sultan , and a protégé of the @entity150 , he fell from favor with @entity45 after clashing on foreign policy in 2005			0
but he was called in from the cold last year with a mandate to bring down @entity25 , diplomats in the @entity154 say			0
over the past year , he has led @entity2 efforts to bring arms and other aid to @entity6 rebels			1
' @entity22 told diplomats that he plans to limit interaction with the @entity8 , ' the source close to @entity2 policy said			1
secretary of state @entity125 says he 's confident the @entity8 will continue to have a good relationship with @entity2 this happens after the @entity8 failed to take any effective action on @entity6 and @entity168			1
relations with the @entity8 have been deteriorating for a while , as @entity2 feels that the @entity8 is growing closer with @entity5 and the @entity8 also failed to support @entity2 during the @entity31 uprising , " the source said			1
the source declined to provide more details of @entity22 's talks with the diplomats , which took place in the past few days			0
but he suggested that the planned change in ties between the energy superpower and the @entity8 would have wide - ranging consequences , including on arms purchases and oil sales			2
@entity2 , the world 's biggest oil exporter , ploughs much of its earnings back into @entity8 assets			1
most of the @entity2 central bank 's net foreign assets of $ 690 billion are thought to be denominated in dollars , much of them in @entity193 bonds			0
' all options are on the table now , and for sure there will be some impact , ' the @entity2 source said			2
he said there would be no further coordination with the @entity8 over the war in @entity6 , where the @entity2 have armed and financed rebel groups fighting @entity25			1
the kingdom has informed the @entity8 of its actions in @entity6 , and diplomats say it has respected @entity8 requests not to supply the groups with advanced weaponry that the @entity83 fears could fall into the hands of @entity212 - aligned groups			1
@entity2 intelligence chief @entity54 also is outraged the international community has let the war continue in @entity6 @entity2 anger boiled over after @entity10 refrained from military strikes in response to a poison gas attack in @entity218 in august when @entity25 agreed to give up his chemical weapons arsenal			1
representative @entity220 , a member of the @entity8 @entity223 ' @entity222 leadership , told @entity225 ' @entity224 on tuesday that the @entity2 moves were intended to pressure @entity4 to take action in @entity6			1
' we know their game			0
they 're trying to send a signal that we should all get involved militarily in @entity6 , and i think that would be a big mistake to get in the middle of the @entity6 civil war , ' @entity220 said			0
' and the @entity2 should start by stopping their funding of the @entity212 - related groups in @entity6			1
in addition to the fact that it 's a country that does n't allow women to drive , ' said @entity220 , who is close to @entity4 on domestic issues in @entity244 but is less influential on foreign policy			0
@entity2 is concerned about signs of a tentative reconciliation between @entity10 and @entity29 , something @entity76 fears may lead to a ' grand bargain ' on the @entity252 nuclear program that would leave @entity76 at a disadvantage			0
@entity54 expressed doubt that @entity4 would succeed in what he called an ' open arms approach ' to @entity5 , which he accused of meddling in @entity6 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity31			0
' we @entity2 observe president @entity4 's efforts in this regard			0
the road ahead is arduous , ' he said			0
' whether ( @entity252 president @entity266 ) @entity265 will succeed in steering @entity5 toward sensible policies is already contested in @entity5			0
the forces of darkness in @entity270 and @entity29 are well entrenched			0
' the @entity96 has been paralyzed over the 31 - month - old @entity6 conflict , with permanent members @entity58 and @entity273 repeatedly blocking measures to condemn @entity25			2
@entity2 backs @entity25 's mostly @entity142 rebel foes			0
the @entity6 leader , whose @entity278 sect is derived from @entity279 , has support from @entity5 and the armed @entity257 @entity279 movement @entity281			0
the @entity6 leader denounces the insurgents as @entity212 - linked groups backed by @entity142 - ruled states			0
in @entity31 , home of the @entity286 , a simmering pro-democracy revolt by its @entity279 majority has prompted calls by some in @entity10 for @entity8 ships to be based elsewhere			0
many @entity8 economic interests in @entity2 involve government contracts in defense , other security sectors , health care , education , information technology and construction .			2

@entity2 is an important ally to the @entity8 as it provides a secure source of oil
@entity2 diplomats now promise a ' major shift ' in relations with the @entity8 over inaction in the conflict in @entity6
secretary of state @entity125 says he is committed to keeping a good relationship with the @entity2
