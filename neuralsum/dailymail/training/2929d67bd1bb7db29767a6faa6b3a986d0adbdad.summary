the study by the @entity99 - based small - arms research organisation @entity98 documented weapons seized by @entity102 forces from militants in @entity1 and @entity94 over a 10 - day period in july			1
the report said the jihadists disposed of ' significant quantities ' of @entity42 - made small arms including @entity109 assault rifles and included photos showing the markings ' property of @entity42 govt '			2
it also found that anti-tank rockets used by @entity116 in @entity94 were ' identical to @entity118 rockets transferred by @entity95 to forces operating under the @entity121 umbrella in 2013 '			0
the rockets were made in the then @entity122 in the 1980s			0
@entity7 is believed to have seized large quantities of weapons from @entity94 military installations it has captured as well as arms supplied by the @entity42 to the @entity1 army after it swept through northern @entity1 in recent weeks			1
the militants could have opened or damaged the dam , flooding wide areas as far as @entity134 's international airport , where hundreds of @entity42 personnel are stationed , national security council spokeswoman @entity129 said			2
@entity42 defence secretary @entity137 , travelling in @entity136 , said the @entity1 government had asked the @entity42 to launch the airstrikes			1
the six - month - old battle for control of the @entity30 has been a rare case of co-operation between local @entity3 tribes and the @entity146 - led @entity1 military			1
the @entity148 tribe in @entity67 has a long - standing fight with the @entity7 , which split with its parent organization @entity150 last year			0
@entity54 is complicated terrain for the @entity42 as they seek to root out @entity7 , since @entity3 fighting on behalf of the @entity134 government are the exception to the rule			1
the large desert province , bordering @entity94 , @entity156 and @entity95 , has been at war with @entity134 since last december when then - prime minister @entity158 sent troops to raze an anti-government demonstrators ' camp			0
that sparked a tribal revolt against @entity158 whom @entity3 accused of isolating them with indiscriminate arrests			0
@entity7 fighters took advantage of the chaos to muscle in and become the dominant force among @entity3			2
the fighting there , which has displaced 430,000 people since january , strengthened the @entity7 ahead of its lightning blitz this summer across the north of @entity1 , also threatening the semi-autonomous , @entity176 - backed enclave of @entity102			1
injured in battle : a member of @entity1 security forces , backed by @entity3 tribesmen , gives assistance to comrades who were wounded during the attack location : @entity42 warplanes have launched five air strikes on @entity7 militants trying to capture @entity30 meanwhile , the head of the @entity189 has urged its members to confront @entity7 extremists ' militarily and politically '			1
the apparent call to arms came as president @entity43 prepares to go to politicians and the @entity42 public with his own plan to stop the militants			2
backing from the 22 - country @entity189 could provide crucial support across the @entity199 for mr @entity43 's effort to assemble an international coalition against @entity116 , the marauding group that has conquered large parts of @entity1 and @entity94 and committed beheadings and mass killings to sow terror			0
@entity207 forces have already agreed to take on the extremists			0
@entity189 chief @entity209 said what is needed from @entity212 countries is a ' clear and firm decision for a comprehensive confrontation ' with ' cancerous and terrorist ' groups			0
the @entity189 includes @entity216 , @entity95 , @entity156 , @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity219			0
mr @entity43 will meet congressional leaders tomorrow and then outline his plan to the war - weary @entity42 public on wednesday , the eve of the 13th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			0
' i just want the @entity42 people to understand the nature of the threat and how we 're going to deal with it and to have confidence that we 'll be able to deal with it , ' the president said .			0
