by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:11 pm on 7th july 2011 @entity3 airports are bracing for another volcanic eruption that could cripple summer travel plans			0
scientists are closely monitoring unusual underground activity that could signal a massive explosion at a volcano dubbed the ' @entity10			1
' the @entity12 volcano in southern @entity13 is capable of producing four times the debris of the country 's last ash - producing blast that caused flights to be cancelled across northern @entity18 in may			1
danger : scientists have recorded ' unusual ' magma movement beneath the @entity23 volcano in @entity13 , prompting fears it could soon erupt in april last year , ash from an eruption at @entity13 's @entity29 volcano grounded flights across @entity3 for days , disrupting travel for 10 million people in the biggest airspace shut down since @entity34			1
@entity36 geophysicist @entity35 said yesterday that magma appeared to be moving deep beneath the giant volcano			0
' the movements around @entity12 have been unusual in the last two to three days			1
the mountain has been slowly expanding in the last few years because of magma buildup			0
the volcano is ready to erupt , ' he added			0
in the past few decades , @entity23 has erupted about every 10 years , most recently in february 2000 , and experts believe another one is overdue			2
@entity23 is so active that scientists estimate about 10 % of the tephra - the solid matter ejected when a volcano erupts - produced in @entity13 over the past millenium , about five cubic kilometres , comes from this one volcano			1
it is feared that four times as much debris will be spewed into the air as when @entity29 , pictured , erupted last year ' no eruption has started in @entity23 volcano			1
but it might start without any warning			0
' said @entity13 volcano expert @entity61			2
@entity23 , which means hooded cloak in @entity13 , has erupted more than 20 times â€“ and once a decade in recent times in 1970 , 1980 , 1991 and 2000			1
its first eruption , in 874 , produced 2.5 cubic km of tephra , the scientific term for various kinds of debris emitted by volcanoes			0
the @entity29 eruption in april 2010 produced roughly 1.8 cubic km over three days			2
the main reason it grounded so many flights for over a week was that the ash cloud hung so low			2
if @entity12 blows , the amount of disruption it causes will depend on it size and the speed and direction of the wind			0
both of @entity13 's latest eruptions provided warning signs several hours before , but @entity23 is known for having a very short fuse			1
' @entity23 never gives you much of a warning , ' said mr @entity90 , in 2000 , it began rumbling an hour and a half before the outbreak of magma , which was actually an unusually long warning			2
in 1970 we only got 25 minutes notice , ' he added			0
powerful : smoke plumes from the @entity98 in may			0
@entity23 could produce up to four times as much debris if it erupts @entity101 , a project manager at the @entity13 @entity102 , said no immediate safety precautions were being taken but : ' we will watch the mountain and developments very closely			1
' after @entity13 's last two eruptions , geologists have warned that the country 's volcanoes appeared to have entered a more active phase and that more eruptions could be expected , with @entity23 believed to be first in line			1
the volacano , situated about 70 miles east of the @entity13 capital , @entity116 , is a neighbour of @entity29 .			0

@entity23 could erupt soon after ' unusual ' activity recorded
@entity121 , dubbed ' @entity10 ' , could produce four times as much ash as last big @entity13 eruption
planes could be grounded for days if @entity23 explodes
