by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:15 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 04:13 est , 5 november 2013 the @entity4 must reopen its inquiry into vote - rigging scandal which exposed union dominance , @entity3 said today			1
the former chancellor who is leading the campaign to keep @entity10 in the @entity11 called for a ' very thorough investigation '			2
and he stepped up pressure on @entity4 leader @entity14 , insisting the details of the inquiry had to be published to ensure justice is ' seen to be done '			1
warning : former chancellor @entity3 said there had to be a ' very thorough investigation ' into the alleged attempts to rig the selection of the @entity4 candidate in @entity23 mr @entity3 is one of the most senior @entity4 figures to date to call for a new investigation into the @entity27 's influence on candidate selection in @entity23			1
it comes afterthe whistleblower at the centre of the scandal sensationally rejected claims by @entity27 that she had withdrawn her story			1
mr @entity3 told the @entity35 : ' something has gone very wrong in @entity23			0
there needs to be a very thorough investigation			0
i understand the police are looking at matters now			0
' if they proceed , then that is what 'll happen but if they do n't there needs to be a full inquiry and i am quite clear that the results have to be published because that is the only way in which people will be satisfied that justice is done and been seen to be done			2
' his dramatic intervention comes after @entity4 's leader in @entity10 @entity55 admitted the party 's original investigation into @entity27 's influence on candidate selection ' was n't entirely complete ' and should be looked at again			1
@entity61 party chairman @entity60 said : ‘ @entity3 is the latest senior @entity4 figure to blow the whistle on @entity27 ’s shadowy tricks in @entity23			1
' @entity67 bosses up there have been pushing @entity14 around : fixing @entity4 seat - selections , intimidating families and their young children , and signing up people as @entity4 members without their knowledge			1
embarrassed : leader of the @entity57 @entity55 said the vote - rigging scandal had damaged local party morale			0
‘ @entity14 has been totally silent about this , ever since he caved in and cancelled @entity4 ’s inquiry			1
if @entity14 is too weak to stand up to his union paymasters , then he is too weak to stand up for hardworking people			2
’ the leader of @entity82 and @entity83 north of the border also said the long - running row had left people in @entity23 ' embarrassed ' to be members of the party			2
whistleblower @entity89 triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption when she revealed her family had been signed up to the @entity4 without their consent			1
it happened as @entity27 activists were waging a bitter battle to seize control of the safe @entity4 seat of @entity23 , where she lives			1
this led to claims that she and others had been signed up as @entity4 members without their agreement in a bid by the union to manipulate the candidates ’ selection			1
they allegedly hoped to flood the seat with members who they thought could be persuaded to back @entity27 ’s choice to be the party ’s prospective mp			1
the investigation into mrs @entity89 ’s case was dropped suddenly in september , after @entity27 officials produced documents stating that she had withdrawn her claims			1
but , speaking for the first time , mrs @entity89 , 61 , told the @entity125 : ‘ i did not change the testimony			1
i did not change anything			0
i did not withdraw anything			0
’ she is now demanding to know whether the evidence she gave was tampered with by @entity27			1
‘ i want all the emails to see what ’s what , ’ she said			0
‘ i have n’t seen them			0
this has been going on for months			0
i do n’t know what the emails are saying			0
i want to see everything so i know what was said and if anything was changed from what i said			0
’ her statement is entirely at odds with public claims made by the union			2
it raises the prospect of the shelved @entity4 investigation now being reopened			2
@entity148 : the revelations of union practices need to be look at again , ms @entity151 ( right ) said , in an apparent warning to @entity4 leader @entity14 ( left ) ms @entity151 said : ' i think we certainly need to look at that because obviously there is a concern if the investigation was n't entirely complete			1
' again , i say these matters are ongoing			0
we know that some complaints have been given to the police , ' she told @entity164 @entity10 's @entity163 programme			0
' in this process what we want to do is get beyond the point where people are claiming and counter-claiming and get to the point where again individual @entity4 members are treated with respect and , more critically , we fight to get a @entity4 representative in @entity23 who will stand up properly for the people of @entity23			1
' however ms @entity151 rejected calls to publish the party 's internal report , insisting no political party did so with its own investigations			0
' i understand how difficult it is to be a @entity4 member in @entity23 now			2
they have been embarrassed by who was representing them			0
they are now frustrated by what was going on			0
we will work closely with them , ' she added			0
mrs @entity89 ’s bombshell claims appear to undermine the grounds on which @entity4 leader @entity14 closed his investigation into the vote - rigging allegations			1
the whistleblower at the centre of the @entity4 vote - rigging scandal , which saw @entity196 ( right ) become the front - running candidate for the @entity23 seat vacated by @entity199 ( left ) , says she has not withdrawn her story whistleblower @entity89 , from @entity23 ( pictured ) , @entity10 , triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption when she revealed her family had been signed up to the @entity4 without their consent they came as shocking evidence emerged of the practices @entity4 investigators uncovered at @entity23			1
@entity4 has refused to publish its findings but yesterday leaked extracts of its initial inquiry were published			2
they suggested that @entity27 activists falsified up to 112 membership documents , forging signatures on many , and ‘ coerced ’ and ‘ badgered ’ constituents into signing direct debit forms			2
in some cases they even paid the joining fees themselves to get more members on the books and established a secret system for signifying those signed up ‘ specifically for the selection ’			1
last night @entity4 supporters and critics demanded that mr @entity14 publish the full report into the alleged vote - rigging			1
only today , @entity27 leader @entity231 said that the ' evidence from the families has been withdrawn ' ‘ we ’ve heard umpteen reports , allegations , suppositions as to what did or did not happen			1
we ca n’t tell fact from fiction			0
we ca n’t tell what is and is not being spun , ’ a local party spokesman said			0
‘ i want him to publish the report , the constituency wants him to publish the report , everyone i ’ve spoken to wants him to publish the report			0
if errors have been made , then what you do is you get them on the table , you discuss them , you learn from them , and you move on			0
’ conservative mp @entity256 said : ‘ these incendiary revelations show the full extent of @entity27 ’s infiltration of the @entity4			1
but still @entity14 refuses to hold a proper inquiry , or to publish @entity4 ’s internal report			2
this is further evidence that the @entity27 union tried to dupe @entity14			1
‘ yet despite calling it “ bad practice ” , @entity14 backed down in the face of pressure from @entity27 boss and @entity4 paymaster @entity231			1
‘ from day one @entity14 has shown that he is too weak to stand up to the trade unions			0
if @entity14 was forced into a deal with @entity27 to avoid bad publicity during this selection , how many other dodgy deals are being struck between @entity4 and their trade union paymasters ? ’ the @entity275 ’s brother @entity274 said there was ‘ no place ’ for the style of politics being pursued by some trade unions			1
he told the @entity35 ’s @entity281 : ‘ @entity14 was right to say that he wants to reform the relationship with the unions			0
what you call “ old politics ” , rightly has no place , obviously			0
’ mrs @entity89 wrote to @entity4 in march demanding to know how what information they had on her family after she discovered four of them had been enlisted as @entity4 members without signing any forms			1
unite activist @entity295 , @entity4 ’s @entity23 constituency chairman , was trying to get @entity196 – a close friend mr @entity231 – selected as @entity4 candidate and allegedly started a recruitment drive			2
@entity14 's brother , @entity298 , said there was ' no place ' for the style of politics being pursued by some unions it is claimed that mr @entity295 and @entity304 signed up people from the area - including the @entity307 - without their knowledge			2
last night it emerged that mr @entity295 will not be seeking re-election as constituency chairman later this month			0
@entity311 , who was running against @entity304 , acted as the intermediary with the @entity307 in their original statements			0
‘ the statements were then allegedly changed , ’ she told the @entity125			0
the @entity4 did n’t , as far as i ’m aware , come back to ask the @entity307 why they changed their statements , or if they changed their statements			2
’ after mrs @entity89 made her claims , the affair was probed by @entity4 as well as the police			1
but mr @entity14 called off the investigation in september , claiming evidence from ‘ key witnesses ’ had been withdrawn			0
his decision has come under increasing pressure			0
last week emails showed @entity27 officials had themselves drafted the crucial new statement which exonerated them on mrs @entity89 ’s behalf			1
by speaking publicly for the first time , mrs @entity89 has fatally undermined @entity27 ’s claims that it has ‘ no case to answer ’			1
@entity27 has also faced furious criticism after the @entity125 last week revealed its shocking campaigns of bullying and intimidation against more than 60 businesses and the families and friends of bosses			2
asked if there will be a new inquiry , a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ information has been handed to the police			2
we think it is wise to let the process take its course			0
