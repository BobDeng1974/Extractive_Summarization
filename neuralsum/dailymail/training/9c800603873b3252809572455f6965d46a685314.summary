@entity1 head coach @entity0 has taken the blame for his controversial play call in the dying moments of the @entity5 and said he did n't run the ball because he thought they had time to seal the win			1
his team had the ball on the one - yard line , needing a touchdown to win the game with @entity14 , one of the league 's best running backs , in the backfield			1
yet , instead of asking @entity14 to try and make that yard , @entity18 ran a passing play , with @entity21 trying to find receiver @entity22			1
@entity25 corner @entity23 read the situation perfectly , timed his move and made the interception to assure a fourth @entity5 title for the @entity25			1
explaining his decision he said they did n't want to run against their goal line defense and were planning on waiting until the third or fourth down to make the game - winning play			1
he therefore decided to ' waste ' the play			0
we had plenty of downs and a time out and did n't want to run against their goal line people right there			1
' i told my guys that 's my fault totally			0
we had plenty of time to win the game			0
we were playing for third or fourth down , but it did n't work out that way			0
' the decision to pass rather than give the ball to @entity14 was instantly criticized by former players and analysts			1

@entity77 coach @entity0 was not surprisingly the man given the blame			2
' that play call will haunt @entity0 for the rest of his career , ' tweeted former @entity84 receiver @entity83			1
' give the ball to @entity86 ( @entity14 ) in that situation			2
' @entity0 said his thinking was that the @entity25 had their run defense in place and with his wide receivers on the field , they were not well matched - up for a run play			1
crucial moment : @entity18 ran a passing play , with @entity21 trying to find receiver @entity22			1
but @entity25 corner @entity23 intercepted and secured the title he added : ' it is a really clear thought but it did n't work out right			1
we happened to throw them the ball and they make a big play			2
' at this time it seems like overthinking but they have extra guys at the line up scrimmage so we do n't want to waste a run play on that , ' he said			2
' we make those decisions every game , all the time			2
they work out sometimes and they do n't other times			0
this one did n't work out right for us			0
' we had a good play			0
if it was a catch , it would be a completely different story			0
i thought it was going to be a touchdown when i threw it			0
i thought it was going to be game over , ' he said			0
@entity0 said he and @entity21 had shared a moment of disbelief at the end of the game			2
' we just looked at each other trying to realize the gravity of what we just witnessed			0
we did n't say very much '			0
some of the @entity136 players however disagreed			0
linebacker @entity137 told @entity138 he did not understand the call as they have ' the best back in the league '			0
