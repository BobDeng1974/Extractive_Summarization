for 12 years the @entity10 sportsman hid his sexuality , fearing the reaction of the macho boxing world , but the featherweight champion is now out , proud - and wearing the rainbow shorts to prove it			1
being comfortable with who he is has been a struggle for @entity1 , who first realized he was gay after competing for @entity20 in the @entity21			1
@entity22 : @entity1 will wear rainbow shorts as a nod to the @entity25 big fight : @entity1 , left , is taking on @entity27 , right , for a world champion title in @entity29 ' i was not happy with my life			1
i would feel a lot of pressure , and inside , i felt weighed down			0
i cried at night hoping the pain would go away , ' he told @entity36			0
he eventually told his parents he was gay but , although his mother accepted him his father became distant			2
as the 126lb boxer 's career began to turn professional , suspicions about his sexuality circulated			0
he recalled how a crowd turned hostile and verbally abused him in 2008 , and said he denied he was gay to his own promoter , @entity45			2
' [ @entity49 ] once asked me quite openly before a fight , " @entity46 , tell me , are you going to tell people that you are gay ? ’ " , ' @entity1 said			1
' there were other people standing around us , too			0
i was shocked and said , " no , i 'm a man "			0
' @entity1 could only hide for so long and , with the help of a therapist and his new promoter @entity59 , the 32 - year - old finally had the courage to tell the world he was gay in october last year			1
pride : the boxer says he feels liberated after finally admitting he is gay settled : cruz with his boyfriend @entity64 who he is due to marry later in the year acceptance : the boxer , who is ' out and proud ' , wears rainbow shorts when he fights ' i feel liberated			1
i feel free , ' @entity1 , who is due to marry his boyfriend @entity64 in @entity70 later this year said			1
' i [ came out ] so i can also be a better boxer			0
now i have respect in the streets and the ring			0
' the couple would also like to adopt children from @entity20 , although the country currently does n't allow same - sex marriages or adoptions			0
coming out has brought worldwide support for @entity1 , who was inducted into the @entity80 over the summer			1
and , as he tries to make history by becoming the first openly gay man to win a world title , @entity1 will pay homage to his sexuality by wearing rainbow shorts in a nod to the @entity89 community			1
he has also dedicated the fight to the memory of former world champion @entity92 , who died aged 75 in july , and waited decades after retiring before he admitted he was bisexual			2
for all @entity1 's fears of being rejected by fellow boxers and fans , @entity27 , the man he will face in the ring tonight has also been supportive			2
prepared : @entity1 is ready for the fight of his life as he goes after a world title ' i admire him for what he ’s done , ' @entity27 said			1

' the fight is a once in a lifetime opportunity for @entity1 , however , who is determined to win			1
' it 's the most important fight of my life			2
i 'm a gay man , but i 'm also a boxer , ' he told the @entity111			2
' my two worlds have come together and i will fight with all my heart			0
