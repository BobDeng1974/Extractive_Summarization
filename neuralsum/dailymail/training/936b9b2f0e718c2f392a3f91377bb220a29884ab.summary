scientists are poised implement decades of study to give vision to the blind if a new bionic eye is approved by the @entity5			1
in january , the @entity6 was supposed to approve the @entity7 by @entity10 developer @entity8 , now those in the @entity11 who would qualify for the device wait with bated breath as february roars on			2
the implant and eyewear duo will most benefit patients with an inherited form of degenerative blindness that destroys the retina called retinitis pigmentosa , which affects about 3,000 people in the @entity11 new eyes , new life : one day @entity39 ( left , with grandson @entity40 ) hopes to see his families faces again with the help of the @entity7 ( on @entity39 , right ) sufferers of the disease experience a gradual retinal generation and an accompanying loss of vision that eventually leads to blindness			2
by implanting a series of electrodes inside the eye , the @entity7 prosthesis will make up for the failing retina by itself transmitting information about lightness and darkness , for instance , to the brain			1
a second aspect of the @entity7 is the eyeglass headset			2
patients wear eyeglasses mounted with cameras that then transmit data about what is in front of them to a small wearable computer			0
cyborg eye : a tiny set of electrodes become an electronic retina , as seen in this close - up form there , the information is transmitted wirelessly to the implant and the brain is sent a series of electrical impulses the patient eventually learns to interpret as light , dark , and shapes			1
‘ no one really thought it would be possible because the tissue around the eye is so soft and delicate , ’ dr. @entity83 , of the @entity84 at @entity85 told the @entity86			1
‘ if we continue to develop this type of technology and begin to understand the new electrical language of pulses to the brain , to the eye , we can apply it to other parts of the body and we can change our world and how we relate to it , ’ continued dr. @entity83 , who has been working on the technology for 25 years and is co-creator the @entity105 seeing the future : lead reseachers believe the device will once day allow the blind to see color and even have their vision zoon , like like an @entity113 one early patient , @entity39 of @entity115 , @entity116 , had lost his sight completely to retinitis pigmentosa and sought help from the @entity7 researchers			1
after undergoing the implantation in 2011 , @entity39 was able to distinguish between dark and light and used that ability to help him maneuver through space			0
his hope is to one day see the face of his grandson , @entity40			0
neither @entity39 nor any of the other recipients of the @entity7 in the @entity11 and @entity25 thus far are able to see completely normally			0
however , researchers say some of the @entity7 recipients are able to identify letters just a few inches tall			0
dr. @entity83 says the device 's reliance on an external computer is key to its future success and usefulness			0
‘ software upgrades will allow us to do more for people – because the implants do n’t need to change , the glasses can be enhanced with software upgrades			1
’ @entity83 sees a future where thanks to his device , once - blind patients will see in various colors and even , he says , in digital zoom , just like ‘ your @entity113			0

first bionic human eye now awaiting approval from @entity5
@entity155 is the product of over 20 years of research
' we can apply it to other parts of the body and we can change our world ' says *inventor*
