by @entity0 this is the moment a quick - spinning whirl of multi-coloured ' tornado ' fire shot into the sky while a farmer was burning off his field			1
the natural phenomenon , sometimes described as a ' fire devil ' , was caught on camera in this incredible image by stunned driver @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the photographer who snapped the scene said the colourful inferno and thick clouds of grey smoke - created when the fire mixed with strong winds - was the ' coolest / scariest thing ' she had ever seen			1
she used the hashtag # nofilter - which users sometimes employ to show they have not used any effects to create the image - to emphasise how shocked she was by what she had seen			0
she wrote : ' had such a wonderful weekend , but this had to be the coolest / scariest thing i 've ever seen			0
' a farmer burning off his field and as we stopped so i could take a picture the wind whipped up this fire twister			1

fire whirls are formed when intense heat and strong winds combine			2
the dangerous - looking mixture then creates a tornado - like column which whips up debris and other gases			2
ms @entity10 later told @entity52 news : ' thanks to my love of @entity27 i chose to drive by and as i stopped to take a picture the wind whipped up the fire into this funnel			1
' the sound and heat were intense and a bit scary not knowing if it would stay put , but it only lasted a couple minutes			0
' fire whirls are described by meteorologsists as ' rapidly spinning vortices that form when air superheated by an intense wildfire rises rapidly , consolidating low - level spin from winds converging into the fire like a spinning ice skater , pulling its arms inward '			0
they are usually very narrow but can reach nearly 100ft .			0
