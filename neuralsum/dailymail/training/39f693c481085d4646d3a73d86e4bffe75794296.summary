the increasing popularity of dating apps on mobile phones has fuelled a surge in cases of sexually transmitted diseases , say doctors			1
@entity7 and other match - making firms have proved explosively popular , especially among those in their 20s and 30s , providing users with lists of potential sexual partners nearby			1
but sexual health experts say ' hook - up ' apps are leading to rises in sexually transmitted infections ( @entity20 )			1
syphilis cases went up nine per cent , from 2,981 to 3,249			1
@entity33 , of the @entity34 and @entity35 , said : ' you do n't have to be a genius to work out that these sorts of apps make having casual sex a damn sight easier			2
' you can find , down to a metre or two , the nearest available person who is interested			0
this is something that just has n't been available before			0
' millions now use @entity7 , which lets users connect via their phones if they ' like ' each other 's picture			2
advocates say it works because it is spontaneous and discreet , but critics believe it is making casual sex more normal			0
an app called @entity59 is equally popular among gay men			1
mr @entity33 said : ' thanks to @entity59 or @entity7 , you can acquire chlamydia in five minutes			1
' @entity64 can cause infertility in women , though most clear it naturally			0
gonorrhoea can cause infertility but needs antibiotics to clear it			0
doctors are worried by a rise in antibiotic - resistant gonorrhoea			2
syphilis can lead to blindness , brain damage and even death if left untreated			0
experts at @entity30 found such apps had a role in six outbreaks of syphilis across @entity83 since 2012			1
they were enabling ' hyper - efficient transmission ' of infections , dr @entity84 of @entity30 told @entity88 magazine			1
outbreaks that would once have been confined to one area were spreading to other towns and cities , he said			0
the companies behind these apps argue no firm evidence yet exists to link them to rises in @entity20			0
but a spokesman for @entity30 said : ' the only way to get protection from @entity20 is to practise safer sex			2

so - called ' hook - up ' apps are being blamed for an increase in sex diseases
gonorrhoea cases in @entity30 have increased by 15 per cent in 12 months
syphilis cases have increased by nine per cent between 2012 and 2013
' thanks to @entity59 or @entity7 , you can acquire chlamydia in five minutes '
