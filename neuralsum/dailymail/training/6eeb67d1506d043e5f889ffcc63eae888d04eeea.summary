when you look at the size of the golf balls it amazes me he managed to swallow one let alone five			1
trapped : the golf balls which were in @entity8 's stomach			1
he was given only a 50/50 chance of surviving after this x-ray was taken ' we call him @entity61 now and my friends are always asking if he 's feeling under par. ' @entity7 takes @entity8 , who weighs 40kg , on daily walks around the edge of @entity37 and @entity66 , near his home in @entity68 , @entity69			1
@entity7 , a former managing director of an automotive firm , said : ' i take @entity8 for a walk around the side of the golf course twice a day			2
' apparently he ate the balls over a period of about six months - which is quite amazing			2
' it means he would have been walking around with these in his stomach for ages			0
' but it only became a problem when two of them moved from his stomach into his gut			0
' he was fine on the friday before he fell ill but he started whimpering , vomiting , and could hardly move by the sunday			0
golf ball ' treat ' : it is thought @entity8 swallowed the balls while being taken for walks around the @entity37 and @entity66 ' we had no idea what was wrong with him			1
we took him to the vets on monday morning and they were extremely worried			2
' so they took an x-ray and found he had five golf balls in his stomach			1

the op almost killed him as they had to cut very close to his pancreas			0
' thankfully he has made a full recovery and seems to be more boisterous than ever			0
' i still do n't know why he likes to eat golf balls - he probably thinks they 're treats			1
' @entity106 removed the balls from @entity8 's badly damaged gut - and said there were fears he may die			1
she said : ' it 's not common to find dogs eating odd objects but we do see it from time to time			0
' i have removed socks , children 's toys , needles and more from dogs in the past			2
' two of the balls had passed into the gut as the body tried to digest them which caused the blockage			0
' we were not sure if he was going to make it at first but thankfully he pulled through			0
