@entity1 's terms and conditions says it will only pay out compensation for signal blackouts lasting 72 hours or more most of us know the pain of having a call cut off or waiting an age for a web page to load after losing mobile phone signal			1
but in order to claim compensation from phone companies , users are being asked to meet a bizarre list of criteria that includes losing signal for three days solid			2
in @entity1 's terms and conditions it says it will only pay out for signal blackouts lasting 72 hours or more , while @entity22 asks user to prove that they lose signal at least seven times a day			1
the company demands that anyone seeking compensation send them logs of dropped calls , or pictures of the screen whenever they lose internet connection			0
@entity1 has around 19million customers , covering a quarter of the @entity36 market , while @entity22 , along with partners @entity37 , have around 31million customers			1
@entity39 said it does not have a fixed policy and would treat each customer on a ' case - by - case ' basis , while @entity44 said it would offer a goodwill gesture , but refused to specify what this meant			1
the details of each company 's policy are written into the terms and conditions of the contract that customers sign when buying the new phone			0
one of the most common reasons for a signal blackout is that a user has entered an area where wireless radio waves , transmitted by signal masts , can not reach			0
this can either be because the mobile handset is too far from the nearest mast , or because a tall building has blocked the waves			2
however , issues with the handset can also cause a temporary loss of signal , as can overcrowding on a particular network or radio frequency , or interference from other devices			0
the research , carried out by @entity77 , comes just after culture secretary @entity78 announced plans for roaming networks			0
the details of each company 's policy are written into the terms and conditions of the contract that customers sign when buying the new phone this system would allow phone users in areas with poor mobile signal to automatically switch between providers if they find themselves cut off , as in foreign countries			1
the move is part of a government drive to eliminate mobile phone ' black spots ' , where no signal is available , which are especially common in rural parts of the country			0
ministers have separately pledged Â£ 150million to build large numbers of new mobile phone masts			2
a spokesman @entity103 told the @entity77 that most issues with signal were faults with individual handsets , which were outside of its control			0
the spokesman said that if users can prove the issue is the fault of the mobile operator , it will offer a goodwill gesture on a case by case basis .			1

@entity22 asks users to prove they have been cut off seven times a day
meanwhile @entity39 and @entity44 say they with deal with each case separately
