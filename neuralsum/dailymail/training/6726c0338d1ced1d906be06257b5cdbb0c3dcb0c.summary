@entity0 will make his first @entity1 start on saturday but there was a time when the hooker looked more likely to follow in the footsteps of @entity6 , the @entity7 skateboarder , than @entity8 , the 110 - cap @entity10 front - row			1
having ditched scrums for skate parks at the start of secondary school , a career in international rugby did not seem a likely outcome for the tearaway teenager			0
but the cost of competing prompted @entity0 to give up his beloved hobby and after returning to his local rugby club his career has been on an upwards trajectory			2
‘ until i was 15 or 16 i was skateboarding instead of playing rugby , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i came second at a @entity26 event in @entity27 — my mate from @entity29 actually won it and a boy from my street came third			0
@entity0 came off the bench for @entity1 against @entity34 - but is set to make his first start against @entity36 ‘ i was one of those putting wax on the kerbs but i was snapping too many boards and they are expensive ! i joined my local youth rugby team [ @entity41 ] and it became a lot more social than going down the skate park on your own			1
’ @entity0 , 26 , has not looked back — apart from one impromptu outing on the board two years ago that ended with his 17st 5lb frame landing flat on the pavement			2
he made his @entity50 debut as a replacement against @entity52 in march 2009 before earning his first @entity1 call - up in the summer of 2013			2
@entity0 used to be into skateboarding like professional boarder @entity6 on saturday he will take over from @entity57 ’s @entity56 , his former @entity50 team - mate who was wearing a protective boot earlier this week , for the second test against @entity36			1
last saturday ’s home debut against the @entity34 was a baptism of fire in terms of the pace of the game , which @entity0 admits was far greater than what he is used to in the @entity67 competition			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity68 ( right ) stand dejected at fulltime after defeat by @entity34 ‘ obviously , it is different coming off the bench but it was so much quicker than i have ever played , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but it was something i enjoyed — apart from the result			0
we are focusing on all the positives , we are not hiding from what happened in that last 10 to 15 minutes , but we have to move on and focus on this week against @entity36			0
’ @entity0 has earned his place in the @entity1 side after good performances for @entity50 the former @entity84 student will run out in front of more than 70,000 supporters at the @entity87 , with cheaper tickets meaning sales have well surpassed the disappointing turnout for saturday ’s defeat by @entity34			1
‘ i went to college and the coach [ @entity93 ] said i could play in the @entity94 , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ i thought that would be as far as i could go			0
then @entity96 came in and gave me a chance with the @entity50 and now i have been told i ’m going to start at the @entity87 on saturday			0
it ’s a dream come true			0
