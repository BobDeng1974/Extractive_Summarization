' but many viewers also used the social network to express their anger and concerns over @entity10 's rally coverage , including historian and @entity1 presenter @entity86			2
he wrote on @entity69 : ' appalling of @ @entity88 to imply any and all jews ( not @entity46 ) responsible for treatment of @entity7 by hectoring lady in @entity6			1
' and added : ' then he had gall to patronise her at the end - " you see people see it from all sides " that @entity7 plight justifies anti-semitic murder ? ' @entity9 @entity102 editor @entity101 also joined the debate , tweeting : ' what is @ @entity88 's problem with @entity9 ? once is problematic			2
' the @entity108 , which works to combat @entity109 in @entity110 , has circulated footage of the incident , and has called on those offended by it to formally complain to the @entity1			0
director of communications , @entity115 , told @entity117 's @entity69 apology was ' not really good enough '			0

the petition authors said : ' it was the wrong time and place to ask such a disgraceful question			0
the unity march was a time for @entity58 and the rest of the world to come together and unite against the rising threat of terrorism and anti-semitism , as well as an opportunity to mourn and remember those killed in the horrific attacks			0
@entity10 was in @entity6 to cover yesterday 's rally , held in memory of the 17 victims of last week 's terror attacks , including four @entity9 people in a siege at a @entity20 supermarket ' nevertheless , mr @entity10 showed no sensitivity and asked a tasteless question on live tv which has outraged those who have seen the clip , as well as leaving the interviewee speechless and defenceless			1
' it is not the first time @entity10 has been accused of @entity109			0
in november during a review of the following day 's newspapers on the @entity42 channel , @entity10 , who was anchoring the discussion , faced criticism after discussion of a story about @entity186 leader @entity185 reportedly losing @entity9 support			1
the @entity1 said @entity10 ( pictured ) had no intention of causing offence , and had been discussing a wide range of issues with the rally participants a guest on the programme , political observer @entity195 , had referred to a ' jewish lobby ' , which had abandoned support for @entity186 over his condemnation of @entity46 attacks on @entity200			1
there was anger that @entity10 had not pulled up the guest on her comments , and had added : ' a lot of these prominent @entity9 faces will be very much against the mansion tax '			1
the @entity1 defended the comments , and said : ' it was clear that he was not suggesting that @entity9 people in particular are against the mansion tax			2
' mr @entity115 said his organisation and 33 individuals had complained to the @entity1 about the november broadcast			0
' the @entity1 said there was no anti-semitism in what he said , but according to the @entity220 definition , if a minority group feels it is anti-semitic , it should be considered as such , ' he said			0
' it 's obviously offending people			0
' he added : ' and now he 's done it again in an extreme example when people are mourning the deaths of four jews , among the other victims , and his reaction is to say this to a @entity9 woman who is saying it 's like the 1930s			2
' to somehow bring in mitigating circumstances , is terrible			0
' the @entity235 's [ @entity235 , now the @entity235 ] working definition of @entity109 includes collective blaming of @entity9 for the actions of @entity46			2
' @entity239 , executive director of @entity241 - based group @entity240 , told @entity117 he would ' echo the calls for @entity10 to resign '			2
' i was not the only one who was utterly disgusted at the deeply patronising , offensive and frankly partisan way he hassled this woman - a woman who as a @entity6 jew is genuinely concerned for her well - being â€“ seeking to justify the abhorrent murders of four jews in @entity6 with the @entity46 @entity7 conflict , ' he said			1
' it was tactless , arrogant and he should at resign			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' @entity10 has apologised for what he accepts was a poorly phrased question during an in - depth live interview with two friends , one @entity9 and of @entity46 birth , the other of @entity67 @entity65 heritage , where they discussed a wide range of issues affecting both the @entity65 and @entity9 communities in @entity58			1
