@entity0 is ready for the role of team leader at @entity3 , after a superb season that has seen him outperform reigning world champion @entity5			1

the 25 - year - old @entity10 has only been with the team for a year since his promotion from @entity13 , but says he can shoulder the extra responsibility			1
@entity0 believes he is ready to be the no 1 driver at @entity3 after an excellent first season the @entity10 has out - performed his team - mate , world champion @entity5 ' it 's time now for me to take that role , ' @entity0 told @entity21			1
' i 'm not as experienced as @entity22 , but i feel i 've definitely learned enough now that i can keep the team up at the front where they belong and help them out with developing [ the car ]			0
' i want to be racing at the front , so i 'll do what i can to keep it there			0
' @entity0 is more than 50 points ahead of his @entity32 team - mate in the standings , and still technically in with a chance of denying @entity35 or @entity36 the title			2
@entity0 of @entity10 drives past the @entity39 building before the @entity41 @entity40 this weekend @entity0 is looking to shine in @entity42 as he attempts to catch up with the @entity44 cars in the standings ' it 's mathematically still possible , ' says @entity0 , although realistically the 98 - point gap to @entity35 is too much to bridge			1
but he does look likely to finish above @entity5 , despite not really being put ahead of his team - mate by @entity3			0

' there have n't been any scenarios where i 've really pushed and said , " come on guys , do something â€” give me a team order			0
" @entity0 can still mathematically catch @entity35 , who leads the @entity61 the @entity10 knows that he is unlikely to compete for the title this year , but believes he can in years to come ' i think they 've handled it well			1
i was behind @entity22 for a little bit in @entity66 , but then i boxed [ made a pit stop ]			0
' we sort of tried a different strategy and that got me in front			0
there has n't really been a standout point where i was frustrated			0
' i told the team as the season went on , " if there has to be some orders , ok , " but i want to beat the guy in front on track and not have to rely on them			2
