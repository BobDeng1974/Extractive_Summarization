by @entity0 geologists have come out in defence of carbon capture and storage following concerns raised by leading climate scientists over its safety			1
the @entity10 report yesterday highlighted a number of barriers to using @entity4 , including fatal co2 leaks , transport issues and operational risks , such as seismic tremors			1
@entity4 refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs			2
pictured is @entity27 , co-chairman of the @entity28 , @entity29 , co-chairman of the @entity28 , and @entity31 , chairman of the @entity10 , from left , pose prior to a press conference as part of a meeting of the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) in @entity36 while the technology has the potential to reduce the emissions of a typical coal - power plant by up to 90 per cent , there remain concerns over storing such huge amounts of carbon underground			1
for instance , a report released in 2012 by the @entity46 said that carbon storage may pose a greater seismic threat than oil and gas extraction			2
a further study by @entity52 argued that tiny quakes could damage the seal of @entity56 repositories , releasing the gas back into the atmosphere			2
but the case for @entity4 to reduce emissions is compelling			1
according to the @entity61 , @entity4 could provide one - fifth of the global emissions reductions required by 2050			1
the case for @entity4 to reduce emissions is compelling			1
according to the @entity61 , @entity4 could provide one - fifth of the global emissions reductions required by 2050 one of the main concerns over @entity4 is the pressure that it can exert on the porous rock deep underground			1
‘ it ’s like putting more air into your car tyre , ’ explained professor @entity66			1
‘ because you ’ve got a volume of air in there already , when you increase pressure you can crack rock			0
’ ‘ the other type of risk is there are geological faults underground , and if you increase the pressure , then that can lubricate that fault and create a small tremor on it , ’ said professor @entity66			1
‘ that has n’t happened with carbon dioxide disposal , but it has happened with dams on a tiny scale			2
’ if a tremor is large enough , it could cause @entity56 to leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere			1
this would be a hazard because co2 at high concentrations is an asphyxiant and could be fatal to humans			0
in 2010 , a study by @entity100 found that leaks from carbon dioxide injected deep underground could bubble up into drinking water aquifers near the surface , driving up levels of contaminants in the water tenfold			0
earlier this year , the @entity110 government said it will fund a multi-million pound project to design a carbon capture and storage plant at the @entity114 power station in @entity115			1
meanwhile the @entity116 has 19 large - scale @entity4 projects in operation or in various stages of development – the greatest amount for any country			1
the @entity10 report , however , said : ‘ barriers to large ‐ scale deployment of @entity4 technologies include concerns about the operational safety and long ‐ term integrity of co2 storage as well as transport risks			1
’ it added that : ‘ for the large ‐ scale future deployment of @entity4 , well ‐ defined regulations concerning short ‐ and long ‐ term responsibilities for storage are needed as well as economic incentives			1
’ the ‘ negative tone ’ from 235 eminent @entity145 scientists and economists came as a surprise to a 100 - strong group of geologists meeting in @entity142 today			1
@entity66 , a professor of @entity4 at @entity147 , told @entity148 that with regard to carbon capture , the @entity10 report was ' inherently conservative ' and ' outdated			1
' ‘ the reason the @entity10 write this sort of language is because they work by a set of academic publications and so have to put forward the opposing view , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity10 report also does n’t really cover the last three or four years of research , and with a new field such as @entity4 , that is crucial			2
’ although there are concerns about burying billions of tonnes of @entity56 underground , engineers have been doing something similar for decades			2
carbon capture and storage ( @entity4 ) has not yet been applied to scale and many barriers remain			1
pictured is a @entity170 employee at the carbon dioxide capture and storage facility in @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 since the 1930s , the oil and gas industry has been injecting various fluids underground , and since then , researchers have been attempting to understand the risks this poses to human safety			2
one of the main concerns over @entity4 is the pressure that it can exert on the porous rock deep underground			0
‘ it ’s like putting more air into your car tyre , ’ explained professor @entity66			1
‘ because you ’ve got a volume of air in there already , when you increase pressure you can crack rock			0
’ but he added that the oil and gas industry has the technologies to monitor this pressure and prevent subsurface cracks from appearing			2
‘ the other type of risk is there are geological faults underground , and if you increase the pressure , then that can lubricate that fault and create a small tremor on it , ’ said professor @entity66			1
‘ that has n’t happened with carbon dioxide disposal , but it has happened with dams on a tiny scale			2
’ if a tremor is large enough , it could cause @entity56 to leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere			1
this would be a hazard because co2 at high concentrations is an asphyxiant and fatal to humans			0
in 2010 , a study by @entity100 found that leaks from carbon dioxide injected deep underground could bubble up into drinking water aquifers near the surface , driving up levels of contaminants in the water ten-fold			0
professor @entity66 , however , said their more recent studies have placed the risk level to humans dying from a @entity4 leak at one in 30 million			1
' storing carbon dioxide underground is new and leaks are certainly possible – we will need to put careful monitoring in place to make sure they are n’t happening , ' said @entity243 , @entity244			0
' most of the @entity110 ’s potential storage is under the sea though , so leaks are less a safety issue and more about ensuring our captured carbon is n’t lost			0
' if it is , not only will it contribute to climate change but it will need to be accounted for in the @entity110 ’s carbon footprint as well as the carbon footprint of the companies that produced it			0
' a number of co2 storage sites are currently operating , including a @entity260 project beneath the @entity261 , showing that the concept can work on a small scale			0
scaling up , however , would require huge amounts of @entity4 fluid to be transported to storage sites , comparable to the volumes of oil and gas transported today			2
' one potential issue is how pure the carbon dioxide going into the pipelines and storage , ' said ms @entity243			0
' if there are impurities , this could cause corrosion in the pipeline or make the pressures under which carbon dioxide turns from a gas to a liquid unpredictable			0
' these could turn into legal issues if different companies put their carbon dioxide into the same pipeline or store , as you would need to know whose supply was impure in order to know who should pay for the consequences			0
' @entity4 refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs the @entity10 reports form a trilogy of documents on the causes , impacts and solutions to climate change			2
the first part , published last september , found that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘ dominant cause ’ of global warming			0
the second part , published a fortnight ago , warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘ already occurring on all continents and across the oceans ’			0
the final part , published on sunday , on the options for mitigating global warming , warns that we must drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels			0
the @entity10 report , published yesterday in @entity36 , said shale gas may provide electricity and heat for our homes long beyond current targets if scientists can safely develop an emerging technology that traps carbon dioxide and stores it underground			1
the scientists added that wind , solar and hydroelectric power need to triple or even quadruple in scale over the next 35 years if global warming is to be safely controlled			1
the @entity10 document is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change			0
it will inform the policy decisions of governments around the world and will also be used as a bargaining tool before next year ’s @entity145 climate conference in @entity349 , which aims to set legally - binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions			2
it is the third of three it has prepared on the causes , impacts and solutions to climate change			0
the first concluded that humans are almost certainly the ‘ dominant cause ’ of global warming			0
the report added that shale gas may provide electricity and heat for decades to come if scientists can safely develop a technology that traps @entity56			1
a young protestor holds a placard at the entrance gate belonging to a site run by @entity372 the second warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘ already occurring ’ across the world			0
yesterday ’s report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is taken			0
it calls for massive investment in low - carbon alternatives worldwide of around £ 90 billion a year and says governments will need to pour subsidies in to get systems off the ground			0
nuclear power could make an ‘ increasing contribution to low - carbon energy supply ’ , the report finds , but says ‘ operation risks ’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘ variety of barriers ’			1
last year in @entity110 , coal provided 36 per cent of electricity , gas provided 27 per cent , nuclear 20 per cent , oil one per cent and renewable sources 15 per cent			0
yesterday 's report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is take			0

@entity410 said risks include @entity56 leaks , transport issues and seismic tremors
‘ negative tone ’ came as a surprise to geologists meeting in @entity142 today
@entity66 , a professor of @entity4 at @entity147 , told @entity148 that carbon capture is proven and safe on a large - scale
it could reduce emissions of a typical coal - power plant by up to 90 *%*
report added that shale gas may provide electricity and heat for decades to come if scientists can safely develop a technology that traps co2
