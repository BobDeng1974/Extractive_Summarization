rail scam : dr @entity1 faces jail after admitting to six counts of fraud by false representation an international lawyer faces ruin after admitting dodging more than £ 23,000 in rail fares			1
dr @entity1 , 43 , was told he could be jailed after police discovered he spent more than two and a half years cheating the system			1
he gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an @entity16 market town to @entity19 ’s @entity18 station			1
investigators discovered the @entity22 graduate and @entity23 regularly pretended to have travelled from @entity24 instead to save himself huge sums			0
the @entity27 - born lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law , despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an @entity34 children ’s charity and director of leading think - tank , the @entity37 , aimed at ‘ promoting prosperity ’			1
on friday , he pleaded guilty at @entity39 ’ @entity40 to six counts of fraud by false representation , carrying a maximum penalty of ten years in jail			1
the deception places him among the ranks of @entity48 ’s biggest fare dodgers , closely behind a former millionaire fund manager			0
@entity50 was banned from working in the @entity51 last year after avoiding £ 43,000 in train fares from his home in @entity54 , @entity55			1
the scam began to unravel for @entity1 when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at @entity18 last november			1
he claimed to have travelled from @entity24 , in @entity19 , instead of @entity58 , @entity16 , where he and his wife live in a £ 550,000 five - bedroom detached home			1
@entity1 was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor			2
@entity50 ( pictured left ) became the biggest fare dodger in history after avoiding £ 43,000 in train fares from his home in @entity54 , @entity55			1
right , how the @entity69 reported the story in august 2014 when he turned his back @entity1 ran away , but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day			2
an investigation was carried out by @entity74 , which found that the lawyer had dodged fares since april 2012			2
it is understood that he did so by boarding a train at @entity79 and @entity80 without a ticket			0
he then got off at @entity18 , tapping out with an oyster card			0
because there was no start point to his journey , the automated system charged him the maximum @entity88 fare , which is currently £ 7.60			2
but this is still far less than the £ 19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home			0
it was the same ruse employed by @entity50 , who was caught out when his train company realised he had not bought a season ticket since 2008			1
@entity1 ’s train operator , @entity99 , claims he now owes them more than £ 23,000 , which he has agreed to pay back			1
on friday , prosecutor @entity102 told the court : ‘ clearly , the distance between @entity24 and @entity18 , where he was working , is far less than to his true home of @entity16 , and as such he has gained financially			2
‘ the financial loss to @entity99 because of his fraudulent conduct is in excess of £ 23,000			0
’ he said @entity1 had also ‘ altered a photo - card to avoid detection ’ , adding : ‘ it was planned			2
’ @entity1 gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an @entity16 market town to @entity19 ’s @entity114 ( pictured ) @entity1 is the author of a book on international law and worked for a major @entity19 law firm before becoming a senior figure at @entity119 , an investment fund consultancy			1
the @entity121 - based company said he left three years ago			0
he blamed ‘ family problems ’ for his behaviour and his lawyer said he showed ‘ genuine remorse ’			0
@entity126 , defending , said the loss to the railway company was ‘ much closer on my calculation to £ 7,500 ’ and asked for the figure to be reviewed			0
but he said his client was in a position to pay back all the cash , saying ‘ a means form has been completed which shows compensation can be paid in the full amount ’			0
@entity1 was released on unconditional bail while a further assessment of how much he owes is made			0
he will be sentenced next month .			0

following *publication* of this *article* , *solicitors* representing @entity50 have contacted us to say that while £ 43,000 was paid to @entity162 trains to settle the matter out of court , this sum does not reflect the value of the *unpaid* fares alone , which could be measured in *hundreds* rather than thousands of *pounds* .
