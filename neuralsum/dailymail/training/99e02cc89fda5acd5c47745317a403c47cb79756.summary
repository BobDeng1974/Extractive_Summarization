the investigation began at 7.30 pm on sunday when someone saw a text message about the incident and contacted authorities , @entity23 11 reported			1
' so it would be a concealed childbirth			0
he did n't know if it was true or not			0
his remarks were that " i can not keep this			0
i have to tell somebody "			0
' investigators shortly found the family involved and went to their house but the girl was at work			2
at the home , family members were shocked by the possibility that someone there had given birth , @entity8 said			2
as investigators looked around the home , one saw what appeared to be a bloody towel or shirt in the teen 's bedroom , he said			1
' we had some suspicions , but we did n't have anything else , ' @entity8 said			0
investigators left and discussed getting a search warrant , but the girl 's father called back about 10pm sunday and said , ' you need to come back to our house			1
we found what you 're looking for '			0
he led investigators to a shallow grave in the backyard where he had uncovered enough to see the baby 's head , @entity8 said			1
discovery : sheriff @entity8 said police investigated after someone alerted authorities about seeing a text message about the hidden pregnancy			1

' i did n't really agree with that when i first heard it , ' he said			0
' but the social services people said teens are very , very clever in hiding this type of stuff			0
there may be ways of concealment that i do n't know about			0
' he encouraged others in this situation to talk with a counselor , get prenatal care and at least use @entity13 's safe haven laws to drop off their baby			1

it 's not clear if they knew that the baby was buried , he said			2
he expects concealment of birth charges and possibly others			2
' if things go the way our investigation is leading us , it could become a death investigation , ' he said			0
' from sunday night and nobody knowing , it 's evolved in our investigation that at least the newborn child 's father was aware ( of the pregnancy ) and that he had told some people about it			1
' from what seemed to be a clearly discrete pregnancy has turned into at least a half dozen or so people knowing about this pregnancy			0
