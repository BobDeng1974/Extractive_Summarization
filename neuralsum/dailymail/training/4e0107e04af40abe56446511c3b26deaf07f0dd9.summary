when @entity0 was released all those years ago on @entity1 , a well - known gaming website recommended you bought on that console it if was the only means of playing the game			1
see , @entity0 was a @entity7 title , ported and scaled down for console - and during that transition , the quality of the experience suffered slightly			1
the same is true of the @entity13 games			0
if you 're after jaw - dropping visuals , photo - realistic character models and want to see the frostbite 3 engine in all of its glory , either wait for next - generation offerings or play it on a high - powered pc			1
if you ca n't wait that long , current - gen will suffice - but expect the overall experience to take a hit			1
stunning : to get the best out of @entity26 , you must play it on a high - end pc or wait for next - gen consoles at its core , @entity26 is a multiplayer game , and this is by far its strongest hand			1
there are 10 maps in total , all perfectly designed to cater to your gameplay style - whether that 's finding a ' quiet ' spot and sniping enemies with a high - powered rifle , dog - fighting in a jet - plane or engaging in naval combat			1
destructive environments make a comeback , but its ' @entity45 ' that steals the show			2
this introduces massive , destructive events that drastically change the map when certain criteria are met			0
these events are best discovered for yourself , even if they become slightly predictable the more you play			0
there are also plenty of new modes from @entity56 - that sees two sides fighting to defuse a bomb , to @entity59 , that caters to the ever - growing second - screen gaming market			2
the latter sees you get a tactical map of the battlefield where you can direct your team to different points of interest , send in supplies and warn your troops of impending attacks			0
there 's no ignoring the fact that the campaign , although incredibly entertaining while it lasts , ultimately feels tacked on			2
it 's not helped by a stats counter , rewarding you for killing foes and headshots , that seems completely out of place and acts as a reminder that this is multiplayer game at heart			2
any emotional punch the plot tries to deliver is hence crushed as enemies are not seen as ' living things ' but a means of ending the level with the highest score possible			0
still , the five - or - so - hour - long single - player is leagues better than its predecessor 's bland effort , featuring set - pieces that give even the most far - fetched @entity96 moments a run for their money			1
plus , it even features a more than capable performance from its leading men , particularly @entity104 's @entity103			0
a blast : the single - player story may be lacking in emotion , but it 's still a very enjoyable , five - hour thrill ride sadly , there 's no avoiding the @entity110 problems			1
enemies will run right past your teammates and make a beeline for you , take cover right next to your squad mates and launch grenades at every given minute			0
these gripes do n't massively detract from the experience , but are noticeable throughout the entire campaign			0
even so , @entity26 is a compelling package - one that serves to satisfy both those waiting for a full - fat @entity96 : ghosts campaign , and keen multiplayer gamers			1
battlefield 4 is out now			0
@entity7 was powered by @entity127 graphics card in @entity128 ( a single @entity129 was able to run the game at maximum settings at a smooth framerate , too )			2
follow us on @entity134 : @ @entity135 and on @entity136 : @entity137 .			0

next - generation graphics look stunning on pc but @entity140 takes a hit on console
*vastly* - improved single - player campaign but it 's short - lived
*brilliant* multiplayer that caters for all types of gamers
' @entity45 ' *mechanic* is fun to start with but can wear thin
