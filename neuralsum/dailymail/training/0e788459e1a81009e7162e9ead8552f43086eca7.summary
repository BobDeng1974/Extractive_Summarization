by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 16 january 2013 a woman whose mother died of breast cancer has become the first in @entity5 to take preventative medication to reduce her risk of developing the disease			1
the innovative treatment could now be offered to thousands more women after new guidelines were announced yesterday aimed at protecting those most at risk of breast cancer			1
@entity14 , from @entity15 , started taking tamoxifen in summer 2011 at the age of 35 because of her family history of the illness			1
cancer - free : @entity20 has been taking @entity21 as a preventative for 18 months she was healthy and had no signs of cancer but decided to take part in the trial at the @entity28 in @entity29 to minimise her chances of falling victim			1
miss @entity20 's mother , @entity32 , died from the illness 20 years ago aged only 44 , so she feared that she , too , could be vulnerable			0
when miss @entity20 , who is now 36 , discovered two benign lumps , it gave her the impetus to sign up for the pioneering treatment			2
she was referred to the @entity40 where tests revealed she had a high risk of developing the cancer			2
but doctors say her risk of developing breast cancer has been minimised by taking part in the preventative medication study			1
miss @entity20 is one of 136 healthy women taking a daily tamoxifen pill for five years as part of the clinic 's research			1
family history : @entity14 , pictured left as a child with her mother , @entity32 , hopes to avoid breast cancer the drug , which blocks the uptake of the hormone oestrogen by cancer cells , stopping them multiplying , is normally given to women with the illness to reduce their risk of the cancer recurring			1
but research has shown it can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 70 per cent when used as a preventative medication			1
international trials showed its preventative effects could last up to 20 years			2
powerful drugs : @entity21 may now be used to prevent breast cancer yesterday the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) suggested women at risk of developing breast cancer should be offered the powerful preventative drugs raloxifene ( @entity81 ) or tamoxifen ( @entity21 , @entity21 or @entity21 )			1
even those judged to be at ' moderate ' risk could be given daily medication for five years before or after the mediation in what has been hailed an ' historic step ' in the history of treating breast cancer			1
@entity77 , the watchdog that advises the @entity91 on best practice , said it was recommending the drugs because there was ' good evidence ' to show they worked in a preventative capacity			1
breast cancer specialist professor @entity98 said the drugs were a ' reasonable option ' for women at high risk because of evidence that they cut the death rate			1
he said ‘ i do n’t think women or doctors will be deterred from using them by the lack of a licence			0
‘ @entity77 's support for preventive drugs could encourage clinicians , it will give them more confidence when talking to women at high risk about their options			0
' miss @entity14 , an academic health researcher who lives with her partner @entity115 , 39 , said : ' it was obviously very hard losing my mum at the age of 15 and the memories of her illness have stayed with me even though i was very young			1
' when i was told about the trial and asked to take part , it was a no - brainer			0
' anything to reduce my risk of breast cancer can only be a good thing , so i did n't have to think twice			0
' i 've been on the trial for a year and a half and i 'm very happy with it : tests have shown that i 'm cancer - free			1
' it 's great that this trial is leading the way nationally			0
' ' anything to reduce my risk can only be a good thing ' : @entity14 takes tamoxifen daily one in 10 women in @entity5 will develop breast cancer , and studies have shown a strong genetic link			1
the disease is the most common cancer in the @entity5 with around 50,000 women and 400 men diagnosed with the condition each year			0
women with faulty genes such as @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 are among those who have a more than 80 per cent chance of being diagnosed with the disease			0
professor @entity157 , research director at @entity40 , said : ' the first patient to be treated with tamoxifen was treated at the @entity160 in 1969 so @entity29 has a long history of leading the way in breast cancer research and treatments			2
' our studies have shown that it can help to reduce the risk of breast cancer by 70 per cent in some women so i welcome the draft guidance by @entity77 with open arms			2
' the hormonal drug tamoxifen has been a mainstay of breast cancer treatment for 30 years			2
it halves the chances of the disease returning or affecting the other breast and reduces the risk of dying from it			0
the drug is used for five years after surgery and works in breast cancers stimulated by the hormone oestrogen			0
prevention trials show it cuts the chances of developing the disease by 30 to 40 per cent			0
@entity21 can be used in women before the menopause , unlike some newer drugs , as well as afterwards			0
according to @entity195 , possible side effects include hot flushes , nausea , indigestion , weight gain and leg cramps			0
less common side effects can include depression , tiredness , headaches , blood clots , vision problems , voice changes and , in rare cases , womb cancer			0
@entity21 is still used by thousands of patients although newer , more effective drugs called aromatase inhibitors have become more important			0
@entity81 , which is prescribed for thinning bones , halves the chances of developing invasive breast cancer and has fewer side effects than tamoxifen			2
it is not allowed as a first - choice treatment on the @entity91 but is an alternative if patients ca n't tolerate cheaper drugs .			0

@entity14 , 36 , is *perfectly* healthy but takes tamoxifen daily
the researcher , from @entity15 , @entity225 , has never shown signs of cancer
*government* health watchdog backed preventative use of drugs yesterday
