until recently , @entity1 law allowed men to escape prosecution for rape if they agreed to marry their victim			1
@entity35 , 16 , killed herself when she was married to her attacker ( pictured , @entity36 with a picture of daughter @entity35 ) a judge could recommend marriage rather than jail if the deal was agreed to by the victim and both families - who usually gave consent for fear of losing family honour			2
the law was repealed in january this year after a huge wave of protests following the death of @entity51 , 16 , who swallowed rat poison and killed herself after being forced to wed her attacker			0

despite @entity60 475 being repealed - as the law was known - violence against women remains common in the @entity64 nation			0
campaigners say the new law relies on outdated definitions of rape and violence elsewhere in @entity1 statue , and are asking for the country 's entire legal system to be reformed			2
for example , the severity of punishments can be decided on the basis of whether the victim was a virgin or not before the attack took place			0
a spokesman for @entity81 said : ' the definition of rape fails to recognise the reality that rape is committed in different ways including within coercive circumstances which do not necessarily require physical violence , with perpetrators and victims of all genders , and within marriage			0
' this flawed , narrow definition still allows rapists to escape accountability			0
