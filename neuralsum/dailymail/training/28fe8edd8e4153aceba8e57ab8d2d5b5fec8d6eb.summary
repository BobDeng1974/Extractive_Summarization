by @entity1 reporter published : 09:21 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 12:18 est , 31 january 2014 medical reports have revealed that @entity5 doctors were fooled for years by @entity6 , the gunman who killed 12 people in last yearâ € ™ s rampage at @entity10 € ™ s @entity9			1
the records show that he lied so convincingly to those treating him that they concluded he had no mental health issues despite serious problems and encounters with police during the same period			2
just weeks before the shootings , a doctor treating him for insomnia noted that the patient worked for the @entity24 but wrote hauntingly ' no problem there			2
' more than 100 pages of treatment and disability claims evaluation records for @entity6 , spanning more than two years have now been revealed			2
they show @entity6 complaining of minor physical ailments , including foot and knee injuries , slight hearing loss and later insomnia , but resolutely denying any mental health issues			1
in a bizarre incident in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity6 told police on august 7 that disembodied voices were harassing him at his hotel using a microwave machine to prevent him from sleeping			1
after police reported the incident to the @entity9 , his employer , a defense contracting company , pulled his access to classified material for two days after his mental health problems became evident but restored it quickly and never told @entity9 officials it had done so			2
just 16 days later , after @entity6 told a @entity5 emergency room doctor in @entity66 that he could n't sleep , the doctor wrote that his speech and thoughts seemed ' clear and focused ' and noted that he ' denies flashbacks , denies recent stress			1
' liar : the medical records showed that @entity6 answered ' no ' when asked , ' do you have anything that could be considered a weapon ? ' the medical records said @entity6 , 34 , was found sleeping in the @entity5 waiting room in @entity66 on august 23 while waiting to see a doctor			1
during that visit he was prescribed 50 milligrams of trazodone , an antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication that in such low doses can be used to treat insomnia			0
' denies any pain except discomfort rt ( right ) temple , ' a nurse wrote on august 23			0
' @entity87 ( patient ) taking no medications including any otc ( over-the - counter ) medications			0
' an attending doctor provided additional details , saying @entity6 suffered from fatigue after sleeping only two or three hours every night over the past three weeks			1
' speech and thoughts clear and focused			0
denies drugs , cocaine , heroin , caffeine product , depression , anxiety , chest pain , sob ( shortness of breath ) , nightmares			0
he denies taking nap during the day			0
denies @entity114 ( suicidal ideation ) or @entity116 ( homicidal ideation ) , ' the doctor wrote			0
' he works in the @entity24 , no problem there , ' the doctor added			0
the medical records showed that @entity6 answered ' no ' when asked , ' do you have anything that could be considered a weapon ? ' the @entity5 told the @entity125 that was a standard question it asks veterans whom it treats in a triage setting			1
five days later , on august 28 , @entity6 visited a @entity5 medical facility in @entity41 , again complaining of sleeplessness : ' patient presents to @entity132 with c / o ( case of ) awakening each morning about 4am like clockwork and he can not figure out why this is happening			1
' he answered ' no ' when asked whether he was having feelings of hopelessness for the present and the future			0
another doctor that night described the examination as ' unremarkable			0
' the @entity5 gave him 10 more tablets of trazodone and sent him home just before 9pm			0
@entity6 , a defense contractor and former @entity9 reservist , went on a deadly shooting rampage at the @entity9 on september 16 , spraying bullets in a hallway and firing on workers from a balcony			1
he died in a gunbattle with police			0
understanding an attack : before the @entity9 shootings , @entity6 left behind a note that @entity158 agents recovered saying he had been targeted by ultra-low frequency radio waves for the previous three months he had purchased the shotgun he used two days before the shooting from a gun shop in @entity163			1
@entity6 had been involved in at least two earlier shooting - related incidents , in 2004 when he was arrested in @entity165 and charged with malicious mischief for shooting the tires on a construction worker 's vehicle and in 2010 when he was arrested in @entity170 , @entity171 , for firing a rifle into a neighbor 's apartment			1
no charges were filed in those two cases , but it was not immediately clear whether @entity6 was answering honestly on aug. 23 when he was asked whether he still had any weapons			2
the @entity158 told the @entity125 it found no weapons when it searched the hotel where @entity6 had been staying after the shootings			2
before the @entity9 shootings , @entity6 left behind a note that @entity158 agents recovered saying he had been targeted by ultra-low frequency radio waves for the previous three months â € ” the period that covered his visits to the @entity5 medical facilities when he denied he was experiencing any stress or violent thoughts			1
@entity189 , a lawyer representing the family of one of the shooting victims , told the @entity125 it 's possible that @entity6 was evasive with his doctors but expressed skepticism that physicians adequately questioned @entity6 about why he was n't sleeping			1
' there does n't appear to be very much curiosity about what the ideology of the insomnia is , ' said @entity189 , who represents the family of @entity203 in a federal lawsuit			0
the lawsuit claims the @entity5 failed to treat @entity6 ' mental illness			2
@entity189 noted that @entity6 aggressively confronted a family at @entity208 on august 4 , just days before his encounter with police on august 7 that was so bizarre that police contacted the @entity9 about their concerns			1
@entity6 ' family also had concerns about his mental health during the period			1
victims : one man lays on the ground in the @entity9 after being shot			2
12 died in the attack if doctors were perplexed about the cause of a patient 's problem , there are limits as to how far they can investigate			1
the executive director of the @entity229 , dr. @entity230 , said conducting an online search of a patient would be time - consuming and unlikely to help			2
that 's particularly the case for a doctor working in an emergency room setting treating a condition as common as insomnia , he said			0
with few exceptions , it would be illegal to contact others , such as family , friends or an employer to search for clues , @entity230 said			0
' in an emergency setting , a patient with insomnia who does not report stressors or substance use , who denies suicidal or homicidal thoughts and who otherwise does not have urgent psychiatric or medical issues would typically be referred for further , full evaluation of the insomnia in a nonemergency setting , ' said dr. @entity260 , acting director of quality improvement for the @entity262			0
the @entity125 obtained 114 pages of @entity6 ' medical records under the @entity265 after requesting them a few weeks after the shootings			1
it is unusual for the government to disclose anyone 's medical files , but the @entity5 agreed that the public interest in the mass killing outweighed @entity6 ' privacy rights in keeping his treatment records secret after his death			1
in the records the @entity125 obtained , the government withheld the names of all the doctors and others who treated @entity6 to protect their privacy			1
@entity282 and the @entity24 are investigating the shootings , including whether faulty security clearance procedures allowed him to get and maintain his job			0
looking over the tape : @entity6 is seen on surveillance footage carrying a backpack into the building some lawmakers have said @entity6 fell through the cracks at the @entity5 and should have been treated by mental health professionals , but they have stopped short of specifying what government doctors should have done differently			1
the medical records also describe @entity6 ' efforts to qualify for disability payments because of ringing in his ears and orthopedic problems			2
in february 2011 , almost immediately after @entity6 received an honorable discharge from the @entity9 , he complained about tinnitus , which he said was ' annoying and can be distracting			1
' he said it began in 2009 when he was still serving in the @entity9			0
an audiologist in @entity304 determined that his hearing in both ears was ' within normal limits ' and said any hearing loss or tinnitus probably did n't occur when he was serving in the military			0
in october 2011 , @entity6 filed another disability claim for what he said was a broken right foot he suffered when he fell down stairs in 2009 , causing him mild to moderate pain daily			0
the @entity9 alleged in a nonjudicial punishment in july 2009 that @entity6 was drunk when he leaped off stairs and suffered a broken ankle , but @entity6 appealed the disciplinary action and it was removed from his record six months later because there was insufficient evidence he had been intoxicated			1
@entity6 also complained to the @entity5 about a spine problem and conditions with his knee and shoulder			2
an examiner concluded that @entity6 had a degenerative disc in his back and less movement than normal in his shoulder and knee			0
the government granted him a 20 per cent disability rating for orthopedic issues in december 2011			0
he was awarded an additional 10 per cent for tinnitus and received $ 395 in monthly benefits retroactive to his leaving the @entity9 , or about $ 4,740 .			0

@entity6 left a note saying that he had been targeted by low - frequency radio waves for three months before the september 2013 shooting
that time period lines up with when he was *regularly* visiting @entity344 doctors complaining of sleeplessness
medical reports show doctors wrote him off and gave him sleeping pills , concluding ' no problem there ' in reports
@entity6 went on to kill 12 people at the @entity9
