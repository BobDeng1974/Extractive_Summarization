prime minister @entity1 's chief of staff has come under fire yet again for her controversial decision to ban @entity5 appointments from retaining their positions on government boards			1
the move by @entity10 has been derided by the business community as ' unrealistic ' because nearly all of the directors on government boards were employed during @entity5 's six - years in government			1
speaking at an @entity18 lunch , chairman of @entity20 , @entity16 confirmed the ban on @entity5 appointees to government boards , claiming he will lose his position when his contract expires in june			1
' @entity5 was in power for six years			1
virtually everybody currently serving on the boards of government bodies was either appointed or reappointed while @entity5 was in power , ' mr @entity16 said			1
' if @entity1 persists with his policy , there will be a full clean out of directorships			1
' ' the reality is that , yes , there is a rule that no one on the board of a federal government agency has been reappointed , ' mr @entity16 said			0
' it 's an issue that many people are finding worrying			0
' mr @entity16 , who is also chairman of @entity48 , said the policy was at odds with what the @entity18 and @entity51 subscribed to as good governance			1
' my understanding is that there are many people like me who are disappointed with this quite brutal rule , ' he said			0
' i have n't come across anyone actually in government , let alone in private enterprise , who says ` oh this is a wonderfully good initiative '			0
' @entity64 member and @entity66 director dr @entity63 said the panel 's size had been significantly reduced as members had not been reappointed when their terms came up			0
in february , it was revealed that @entity72 was at loggerheads with top cabinet ministers over her attempts to micro manage @entity76 and steal @entity78 's thunder ' the reality is we lost a lot of people who brought great expertise , major institutional investors , investment bankers etc , and i think it 's to the detriment of how the panel functions			0
' mr @entity16 said @entity90 needed excellent people on these challenging boards			0
' the last thing we want to be doing is to one kick them off after three years , let alone send a very strong message saying this is the way it ought to be			0
' dr @entity63 , a director of @entity66 , said she was strongly against the rule , as was chairman of @entity100			0
@entity16 is a former @entity101 and is coming up for reappointment in following months , like many of his colleagues			0
many of them are part of the boards for humanitarian or charitable reasons			1
' my understanding is that there are many people like me who are disappointed with this quite brutal rule , ' he said			0
but @entity1 's devotion to @entity116 is unmoving			1
the prime minister has defended her time and time again , calling her ' the fiercest political warrior i 've ever worked with ' in february , it was revealed that @entity72 was at loggerheads with top cabinet ministers over her attempts to micro manage @entity76 and steal @entity78 's thunder			1
foreign minister @entity76 is understood to have been involved in a feud with @entity10 after her extensive attempt to micro manage the government included controlling minister 's media appearances			2
meanwhile , treasurer @entity78 's grievances with @entity10 are also understood to have stemmed from her tendency to over-step her mark and take control			2
at a small celebration following the release of the party 's first budget , @entity10 undermined the treasurer by having the first word - leading the toast , and ultimately taking ownership of an accomplishment that should have been @entity78 's to savour			2
but @entity1 's devotion to @entity116 is unmoving			2
the prime minister has defended her time and time again , calling her ' the fiercest political warrior i 've ever worked with '			1
he is known to have told associates that raised complaints against her : ' you would n't be here if it was n't for @entity10 '			2
meanwhile , @entity1 's future remains uncertain with some disgruntled mps claiming it is only a matter of time before the leadership issue comes to a head .			0

@entity10 has banned @entity5 appointees from keeping their jobs
it was confirmed at an @entity18 lunch
it has been *met* with outrage from the @entity168 and business community
many of the appointees do the job for humanitarian reasons
@entity1 is a staunch *supporter* of @entity10 calling her a ' political warrior '
