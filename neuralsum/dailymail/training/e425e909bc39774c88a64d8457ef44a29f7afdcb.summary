a church tried to teach its youth group a lesson by staging a raid in which unsuspecting teens were ‘ kidnapped ’ at gunpoint , forced into a van and made to watch one of their pastors being assaulted in his house			1
the ' lesson , ' according to pastors at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , was meant to teach them about what @entity17 missionaries are subjected to in other parts of the world			1
however , at least one girl , 14 , was bruised and battered after the object lesson , and has now filed a complaint with the police			1
' i had my hands behind my back			0
they said , ` just do as i say , and you wo n't be hurt			0
' ’ the girl said she and about 17 other teens were taken to the pastor 's house , where it appeared he was being assaulted , covered in what looked to be blood			1
eventually , she said , the adults in charge revealed it was a staged event			0
one of the two ‘ kidnappers ’ was an off - duty police officer who was carrying a real gun , according to abc27.com			1
however , the gun was unloaded at the time of the raid			1
the girl was shocked that no one told her and the rest of the youth group the raid was only a drill			1
' they heard me crying , ' the girl said			2
' why not right then and there tell us it was a joke , when you see me crying ? ' @entity12 of @entity27 ’s pastor , @entity77 , told the @entity78 that the church is ' so saddened ' that the girl was traumatized at the wednesday evening youth meeting			1
kidnapped : the teens were shoved into these church vans and driven to the pastor 's house learning exercise : pastor @entity77 said the staged abduction was meant to show them what sort of persecution @entity17 face in other parts of the world but he said his intent was never harmful – instead , it was designed to prepare them for what they might encounter as missionaries			1
@entity77 did n't disclose the names of those involved but said the mock kidnappers included an off - duty police officer and a retired @entity104 captain			1
' it was a youth event , to illustrate what others have encountered on a regular basis , ' he said , adding that the focus of the lesson was ' the persecuted church ' in other countries			2
@entity77 said there were about 17 students at the meeting and the mock kidnappers covered the students ' heads , put them in a van and interrogated them			2
neither the students nor their parents were told about the raid beforehand , he said , though it was discussed with the parents of one youth who might have health issues			1
@entity77 said the church has conducted similar events at least twice before , adding that ' there was much thought given to the safety aspect			2
' ' if anyone was ever uncomfortable , they would be removed ' from the exercise , @entity77 said , though part of the idea was to shock the students with the experience			0
in the future : @entity77 says : ' i would find a way that we could continue to keep the shock value , ' he said , ' but i would find a way to inform the parents ( beforehand ) ' @entity147 police chief @entity145 declined to comment until an investigation into the raid is complete			1
the names of the mother and daughter who complained have n't been made public			0
there could be consequences if the teens did n't know what was going to happen and did n't agree to be a part of the event , @entity154 first deputy district attorney @entity153 said			0
one security expert told the @entity78 that role - playing training is sometimes conducted ' at the quasi-military level ' for groups that are going to work in war zones			2
@entity166 , chairman of business intelligence and investigations at @entity169 , a worldwide risk consulting company with headquarters in @entity172 , said the idea of conflict zone training ' is to acclimate someone to a possible situation that might arise			0
' the training might involve everything from what items they should take to the country to a review of who they 're meeting and security conditions there , he said			0
@entity188 , who studies international affairs and terrorism at @entity191 , a @entity192 school that emphasizes a ' @entity17 worldview , ' questioned the wisdom of submitting a youth group to a mock kidnapping			1
' it just seems inappropriate for that age group			2
you would think there would be permission from the parents , ' @entity188 said , adding that he 's never heard of anything like that happening at a church			0
he said that while there have been highly publicized episodes of violence directed against @entity17 missionaries in other countries , it seems those countries ' local religious groups are more at risk			1
@entity77 said members of the church have made numerous mission trips overseas and have learned to be cautious			0
he said they were planning a trip to @entity219 but reviewed current news and advisories and decided it was unsafe			0
@entity77 said he ' would love to ' apologize to the girl and her mother but feels he ca n't until the police investigation is done			2
he said the church wants to keep doing the program but would make changes			0
' i would find a way that we could continue to keep the shock value , ' he said , ' but i would find a way to inform the parents ( beforehand )			0
