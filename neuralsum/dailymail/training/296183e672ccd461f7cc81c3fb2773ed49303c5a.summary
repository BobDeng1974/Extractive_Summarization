a new book has branded @entity2 one of the world ’s most dangerous tourist destinations			2
@entity6 author @entity5 suggests that widespread police corruption , violence and crime are all blighting a country once commonly referred to as the ‘ @entity11 ’			1
in his book @entity2 : deadly destination , mr @entity5 attempts to expose the reputation of @entity2 as a welcoming country , claiming a boom in tourism since the 1960s has created a hatred of foreigners and a ‘ murderous indifference ’ to the millions of tourists who flock to the country ’s white - sand beaches , picturesque countryside and thriving nightlife each year			1
‘ @entity2 ’s carefully manufactured reputation for hospitality , as a land of palm trees and sun - drenched beaches , happy - hour bars , world class hotels and welcoming people , as paradise on @entity49 , is very different to the reality many tourists encounter , ’ mr @entity5 says in the book , which is being published next week			1
‘ the rapid growth in @entity2 tourism has been a triumph of advertising and image creation ; building the perception , firmly entrenched in the @entity58 , that @entity59 embrace strangers			2
‘ in reality , the relations between ethnic thais and foreigners are often difficult ; and there has been growing friction and disengagement , a drift from curiosity to contempt , as visitor numbers have increased			2
in the first nine months of 2014 , there were more than two million fewer foreign tourists who visited @entity2 compared with the same period a year previously ‘ while many foreigners leave the country happy , there are equally thousands of travellers from @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity6 , @entity80 and the @entity81 , both short - time tourists and long - term residents , leaving the country impoverished , distressed , frightened and unlikely to ever return			1
‘ if , with the murder or accidental deaths of tourists a common event , they leave at all			2
‘ life in @entity2 is cheap			2
and the deaths of foreigners often go unlamented ; even unrecorded			0
tourists are still given few warnings of the reality of the situation they are entering			0
’ mr @entity5 previously worked as a news reporter for the @entity98 from 1986 to 1994 and for the @entity6 between 1994 to 2009			1
he has been visiting @entity2 since the 1970s before moving there in 2010			0
after being repeatedly robbed and attacked , he began looking into news reports on the welfare of tourists , which he describes as ‘ scandalous ’ , suggesting that the police have little interest in helping foreigners who report crimes			2
from an initial forecast at the end of last year of 30.27 million foreign visitor arrivals @entity2 ’s @entity109 is now forecasting 25.5 million foreign visitors in 2015 figures released by the @entity113 government showed that between 2011 and 2012 there were 296 @entity113 deaths in @entity2			1
in the 12 months up to april 1 , 2013 there were 389 @entity113 deaths in @entity2 , while in the same period up to april 2014 there were 362 deaths and 267 hospitalisations of @entity113 tourists			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ the attitude of murderous indifference to the welfare of strangers is ingrained enough in the @entity2 psyche for it to justify formal government warnings to the many hundreds of thousands of tourists venturing into the bars and clubs of @entity2 on a nightly basis			1
‘ it is standard operating procedure in @entity2 for the bars and clubs to pay bribes to the local police and municipal authorities in order to be able to open their doors			2
‘ if a bar , club or parlour does not make this payment in all likelihood they will be closed down			0
' the police are not acting in the best interests of the visitors making complaints for the simple reason that they are being paid by bar and club owners ; the commonplace complaints of tourists about being robbed are simply shrugged off			0
' as well as the murder of @entity113 backpackers @entity159 and @entity160 in mid-september , there was a bloody military coup in @entity2 in may @entity2 's much - prized tourist industry , which accounts for 10 per cent of the country 's gdp , is in decay following more than 12 months of political unrest			1
as well as the murder of two @entity113 backpackers in mid-september , there was a bloody military coup earlier this year			1
in the first nine months of 2014 , there were more than two million fewer foreign tourists who visited @entity2 compared with the same period a year previously			2
from an initial forecast at the end of last year of 30.27 million foreign visitor arrivals , @entity2 ’s @entity175 is now forecasting 25.5 million foreign visitors in 2015			1
talking about the country ’s widespread crime , mr @entity5 adds : ‘ visitors to @entity2 are not warned by travel agents , airlines or their own governments that their passports are highly prized in @entity2			1
@entity6 author and journalist @entity5 has written a new book branding @entity2 one of the world 's most dangerous destinatons			1
it will be released next week ‘ depending on the nationality , a passport can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market , several months ’ pay for many @entity59			0
' there are gangs stealing passports to order			0
@entity78 , @entity79 , @entity6 and @entity196 passports are particularly prized			0
‘ there is an established practice across the country of bike , car , jet - ski and other rental services requiring passports as collateral			0
when punters return to claim their documents , they have disappeared			0
' @entity209 adds : ‘ the daily robbing , bashing , drugging , extortion and murder of foreign tourists on @entity2 soil , along with numerous scandals involving unsafe facilities and well established scams , has led to frequent predictions that @entity2 ’s multi-billion dollar tourist industry will self - destruct			1
' @entity113 backpackers @entity159 , 23 , and @entity160 , 24 , were killed on the island of @entity223 in september the book 's author claims that those who know @entity2 well were unsurprised by the murder of @entity113 tourists @entity159 , 23 , and 24 - year - old @entity160 , who were killed in an attack on the island of @entity230 september			1
he said : ‘ the international coverage of the recent brutal killing of two @entity113 backpackers on the island of @entity223 has highlighted what many long - time observers of @entity2 already knew , that its tourist industry is poorly managed and the @entity11 has come to justifiably be regarded as one of the most dangerous tourist destinations on @entity49			1
’ the @entity113 government has issued official warnings about violence to the 860,000 @entity113 tourists who travel to @entity2 each year			1
asked why he decided to write the book , @entity209 told the @entity246 : ‘ at the beginning of 2010 , uncertain of what to do next after leaving full - time journalism , i decided to head to @entity2 , which i remembered fondly from previous visits			0
‘ it only came to me slowly , after having my drinks repeatedly spiked , being robbed , bashed and having my passport stolen , that @entity2 was not quite @entity11 that i had once thought it to be			0
@entity6 author @entity5 began visiting @entity2 in the 1970s before moving there in 2010 ‘ i badly wanted to live in @entity2 , and spent more than three years in and around @entity252			1
unlike many expatriates and tourists , i spent a lot of time with the @entity59 themselves			0
‘ having spent so much time with them , i finally began to understand how they thought ; and to understand that they actively dislike foreigners , have no compunction in robbing them , and that their cultural distaste for foreigners and ultra-nationalistic pride in their own country fuels and justifies the crimes against tourists			0
' he added : ‘ unfortunately , with millions of tourists besieging the country , the locals ’ response to foreigners has gone from curiosity to contempt			2
‘ overwhelmed with millions of tourists , many of whom appear to save their worst behaviour for the streets and bars of @entity2 , cries of “ @entity285 ” , i do n’t like foreigners , and “ @entity2 is for @entity59 ” can be heard from one end of the country to the other			1
‘ those who think that mishaps only befall those who are misbehaving are fooling themselves			0
' britons are warned that assaults and robberies are reported regularly in the @entity297 archipelago the @entity298 warns @entity113 travellers : ' @entity301 tourists including @entity113 nationals have been victims of vicious , unprovoked attacks by individuals and gangs in @entity297 , @entity306 and @entity223 ( the @entity297 archipelago )			0
in january 2013 a @entity113 national was killed in a shooting incident while at a beach party in @entity311 on @entity312 and in september 2014 , 2 @entity113 nationals were killed in @entity223			0
' it adds : ' violent sexual assaults and robberies against both men and women are reported regularly in the @entity297 archipelago and @entity320 province			0
these are particularly common during the monthly @entity323 parties and generally occur late at night near bars			0
' a spokesman for the @entity326 of @entity2 ( @entity327 ) dismissed mr @entity5 ’s claims of the dangers facing tourists , calling them ‘ an exaggeration ’			1
‘ @entity327 are of course disappointed to hear of this but as an organisation has much confidence in @entity2 as a tourist destination as do the 860,000 , and growing , number of @entity113 travellers who visit @entity2 annually			1
they said : ‘ the vast majority of visitors enjoy a safe and trouble free time and 65 percent repeat tourist arrivals is testament to how much they love @entity2 and wish to return year on year			2
‘ this number would n’t be so high if tourists did n’t feel safe and enjoy visiting our country			0
‘ accidents , robberies and deaths are not exclusive to @entity2 , sadly we read tragic news stories about tourists travelling all over the world			2
a spokesman for the @entity326 of @entity2 called mr @entity5 's claims ‘ an exaggeration ’ ‘ the author , @entity5 ’s , book title is somewhat an exaggeration and we are certain that those who come across this book will conclude themselves that @entity2 is by no means the most dangerous country in the world to visit			1
‘ tourist safety remains of upmost importance and priority to @entity327			0
@entity2 accepts that some of the country ’s safety and security measures need to be improved and just this month the prime minister of thailand , @entity372 - o - cha and the @entity373 , mrs @entity370 announced several new measures to upgrade and improve safety standards within the travel and tourism industry			0
‘ as always , we recommend tourists exercise common sense and courtesy , be considerate and respect local culture and law when travelling abroad to ensure a problem free and rewarding holiday			0
