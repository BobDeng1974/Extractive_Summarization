five grands prix will start an hour earlier this season in the wake of recommendations passed on following @entity5 's horrific accident in @entity6 last year			0
the @entity8 's life - threatening crash in fading light and heavy rain in his @entity11 resulted in the swift formation of the @entity13 , with luminaries such as @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 on board			1
one of the @entity13 's suggestions was that of the four - hour rule whereby ' the start time of an event shall not be less than four hours before either sunset or dusk , except in the case of night races '			0
@entity5 was involved in a horrific incident at the @entity6 @entity28 in october @entity5 's car pictured during a rain - soaked @entity6 @entity30 before his horror crash in the past , a number of races have started in mid-to - late afternoon to accommodate early morning television audiences across @entity35			2
