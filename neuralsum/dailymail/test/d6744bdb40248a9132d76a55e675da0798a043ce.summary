@entity0 today threatened to ' change the direction ' of the @entity3 parliament without even becoming an mp as the @entity5 stepped up its demands on @entity7			1
the @entity5 leader insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament , even though she is not even standing for election to the @entity13			1
and she vowed to use the influence of dozens of mps to get her way for the next five years without voting down the government			0
the @entity5 have enjoyed a surge in popularity since september 's referendum on independence , despite 55 per cent of people voting stay in the @entity3			1
a new opinion poll by @entity40 puts the @entity5 on 54 per cent , up two points on two weeks ago , with @entity7 down two points to 22 per cent			1
@entity7 now faces the prospect of near - wipeout north of the border , robbing @entity22 of his chances of an overall majority			2
however , ms @entity0 has made clear she would act to ' lock ' the @entity30 out of power and prop up a @entity7 government			2
both sides have ruled out a formal coalition , and yesterday mr @entity22 said he had ' made it clear we 're not interested ' in deals , such as a ' confidence and supply ' arrangement where the @entity5 would agree to back @entity7 on important votes such as the @entity58			1
but ms @entity0 insists that after polling day , @entity7 will be forced to do as she says			2
' @entity22 can say what he wants right now , he 's entitled to do so , but he ca n't deny reality , ' she told @entity64 's today programme			0
' if there is a situation after the election where neither of the big parties has a majority they will have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to and compromise with others in order to get their policies through			2
' now , whether that 's as part of a formal deal , or on an issue - by - issue basis it gives parties like the @entity5 enormous clout and enormous influence			1
' a new opinion poll by @entity40 puts the @entity5 on 54 per cent , up two points on two weeks ago , with @entity7 down two points to 22 per cent support for the @entity5 has soared since the independence referendum in september , when 55 per cent of people voted against leaving the @entity3 labour leader @entity22 , arriving at the @entity92 in @entity93 with local candidate @entity94 , said he had ' made it clear we 're not interested ' in deals , such as a ' confidence and supply ' arrangement where the @entity5 would agree to back @entity7 on important votes such as the budget a briefing by @entity105 's company suggests the @entity5 will be the real winners of the election the @entity5 will emerge as the winners from the general election whatever happens on may 7 , @entity105 's firm has warned			1
@entity111 , the consultancy chaired by the former labour cabinet minister , warns @entity7 will be pulled to the left if @entity5 calls the shots			1
' @entity7 may be wary of the @entity5 , because it knows an arrangement with the party could annoy some @entity118 voters , but it may have little choice if it is to form the next government , ' the company said in a pre-election briefing			1
analyst @entity122 says the @entity5 will have ' maximum leverage ' soon after the election and will seek to ' pull the @entity7 to the left , away from the centre ground of @entity118 politics '			1
' this will include pushing @entity7 towards higher public spending , ' he adds			2
the company has made clear that the document are the personal views of mr @entity122 , a former chief economist to the foreign office			0
she insisted that she will lead any talks with the next @entity3 government , despite the fact that she is not standing as an mp			2
@entity139 is currently the @entity5 leader in @entity140 , while @entity141 – who is set to return to the @entity13 – had also been viewed as a potential powerbroker			1
ms @entity0 made clear that she will be in charge : ' i am the leader of the @entity5 and therefore if there are discussions to be had after the election , i will lead those			1
' i am the leader of the @entity5 and people voting @entity5 know that and i do n't think are under any illusions about that			2
' polls continue to suggest that neither @entity7 or the @entity30 will get an overall majority , leaving them to rely on smaller parties to form a government			1
ms @entity0 said that mr @entity22 will ' have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through '			0
she added : ' under the @entity165 it is possible for other parties to change the direction of a government without bringing a government down			1
' the @entity5 leader rejected the suggestion that her party was more austere than @entity7 , insisting ' every single penny ' had been passed on from grants to the health service			1
ms @entity0 said : ' we are putting forward as part of our anti-austerity argument the fact we would vote for considerable increases in health spending across the @entity3 to meet the terms of the @entity185 and ensure as we go into the next decade the health service is properly equipped to face up to the challenges it will meet			0
' she added : ' as long as @entity140 decisions affect @entity191 it matters to the @entity5 and it matters to @entity191 that those decisions are good decisions , to we have a vested interest in making sure the politics at @entity140 is better politics			1
' @entity196 defence secretary @entity195 said : ' when @entity22 's biggest union paymaster is saying that he will be forced to do deals with the @entity5 , it 's no surprise that @entity0 knows she will be pulling @entity22 's strings if he gets into @entity201			2
' working people will pay the price for an @entity22 government that 's propped up by the @entity5 – through more debt , more borrowing and more taxes			1

ms @entity208 - who had been due to set out her party ’s plans to control rents during a visit to a south @entity219 housing estate - was said to be “ resting ” ahead of her battle bus launch tomorrow			0
earlier she dismissed suggestions that @entity7 had stole their thunder , dismissing their proposals as a “ watered down ” version of what the @entity225 are offering			0
she told @entity227 : “ we need to move away from thinking of homes primarily as financial assets and go back to thinking they are safe places for people to live			0
” the @entity225 would also abolish right to buy , she said , and build 500,000 social homes on brownfield sites over the course of the next parliament			0
the party would link a cap on annual rent increases to the consumer price index , as part of a package of measures to make the private rented sector fairer for tenants			0
it is also calling for a @entity247 to investigate ways to bring rent levels down			0
ms @entity208 said : “ at the moment , the private rental market is structured in a way that benefits landlords over tenants , and treats homes as investment vehicles			0
“ as more people rent , rather than own , their homes , it is vital that we correct this imbalance			0
“ keeping rent rises in line with inflation will reduce poverty and allow tenants a better standard of living			0
we also need to look in to all options for cutting rent			0
that ’s why we ’re calling for a @entity247 to tackle our housing crisis			0
” it is not the first time the @entity225 ’ campaign plans have gone awry - the party twice had to postpone a poster launch while earlier this year ms @entity208 suffered a “ brain fade ” during a radio interview in which she struggled to explain her party ’s policies .			0
