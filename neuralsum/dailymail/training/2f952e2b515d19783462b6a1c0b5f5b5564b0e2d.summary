' our research shows 14 per cent of parents of under - 10s have had their kids suggest a payday loan when they ’ve been turned down for things like toys			2

' the @entity272 should give a robust lead in introducing a 9pm watershed for these payday loans so that children are not influenced by this insidious onslaught			0
' the number of adverts should be curbed as the public are being duped into thinking that getting into debt is an easy option and pain free - quite the contrary			1
