the mystery of where @entity2 's water came from has got murkier			1
results from the @entity6 space probe has proved that water did not come from a comet , as had been previously thought			1
the @entity6 mission , which made history by landing on @entity11 in november , shows the water on the icy mass is unlike that on our planet			2
experts now believe asteroids are the most likely carrier of water			2
over the past few months , the @entity33 's @entity6 space probe closely examined the type of comet that some scientists theorized could have brought water to our planet 4 billion years ago			1
it found water , but the wrong kind - it was too heavy			2
one of the first scientific studies from the @entity6 mission found that the comet 's water contains more of a hydrogen isotope called deuterium than water on @entity2 does			1
' the question is who brought this water : was it comets or was it something else ? ' said @entity53 of the @entity54 in @entity55 , lead author of a study published in the journal @entity59			2
something else , probably asteroids , @entity53 concluded			0
many scientists have long believed that @entity2 had water when it first formed , but that it boiled off , so that the water on the planet now had to have come from an outside source			2
the findings from @entity6 's mission to the duck - shaped comet @entity69 complicate not just the question of the origin of @entity2 's water but our understanding of comets			1
until now , scientists sorted comets into two types : near and far			0
the near ones , sometimes called the @entity83 family , originally come from the @entity84 outside @entity85 and @entity86			0
the far ones hail from the @entity88 , which is much farther out			0
but thanks to the dynamics of the early @entity92 , this is not a straightforward process			0
long - period comets that hail from the distant oort cloud originally formed in @entity96 – @entity85 region , far enough from the @entity98 that water ice could survive			0
they were later scattered to the @entity92 's far outer reaches as a result of gravitational interactions with the gas giant planets as they settled in their orbits			0
conversely , @entity83 - family comets like @entity6 's comet were thought to have formed further out , in the @entity84 beyond @entity85			1
occasionally these bodies are disrupted from this location and sent towards the inner @entity92 , where their orbits become controlled by the gravitational influence of @entity83			0
until now , scientists sorted comets into two types : near and far			0
the near ones , sometimes called the @entity83 family , originally come from the @entity84 outside @entity85 and @entity86			0
the far ones hail from the @entity88 , which is much farther out			0
in 1986 , a spacecraft came within about 400 miles of @entity117 's comet , an @entity88 comet , and analyzed its water			2
it proved to be heavier than @entity2 's water			1
but three years ago , scientists examined the water in a @entity84 comet , @entity124 , and it was a perfect match for @entity2 's water , so the comet theory was back , stronger than ever , @entity53 said			1
the comet visited by @entity6 is a @entity84 comet , but its water was even heavier than @entity117 's , @entity53 said			1
that shows that @entity84 comets are n't as uniform as thought , and it once again complicates the issue of @entity2 's water			1
' that probably rules out @entity84 comets from bringing water to @entity2 , ' she said			1
the image comprised of four images taken with the navigation camera on @entity6 and released by the @entity19 on thursday , nov. 20 , 2014 shows comet @entity69 on nov. 17 , 2014 from a distance of 42 km ( 26 miles ) from the center of the comet			2
@entity143 astronomer @entity142 , who was n't part of the research , called the results startling but said they do n't eliminate comets altogether			0
the water could have come from other types of @entity84 comets , he said			0
@entity153 @entity152 program manager @entity151 , however , thinks it does pretty much rule out comets			0
while asteroids are a good suspect — they probably had more water on them 4 billion years ago than they do now — another possibility is that @entity2 kept some of its original water in its crust or in ice at the poles , @entity53 said			1
' this surprising finding could indicate a diverse origin for the jupiter - family comets – perhaps they formed over a wider range of distances in the young solar system than we previously thought , ' says @entity53 , principal investigator for @entity176 and lead author of the paper reporting the results in the journal @entity59 this week			0
' our finding also rules out the idea that @entity83 - family comets contain solely @entity2 ocean - like water , and adds weight to models that place more emphasis on asteroids as the main delivery mechanism for @entity2 's oceans			1
' ' we knew that @entity6 's in situ analysis of this comet was always going to throw up surprises for the bigger picture of @entity92 science , and this outstanding observation certainly adds fuel to the debate about the origin of @entity2 's water , ' says @entity203 , @entity19 's @entity204 scientist			1
' as @entity6 continues to follow the comet on its orbit around the @entity98 throughout next year , we 'll be keeping a close watch on how it evolves and behaves , which will give us unique insight into the mysterious world of comets and their contribution to our understanding of the evolution of the @entity92			2

experts had though a comet *collision* brought water to @entity2 , *seeding* the oceans and *providing* *ingredient* for life
@entity6 found its comet contains a different type of water , with more of a hydrogen isotope called deuterium
experts now believe asteroids may have been *responsible* from bringing @entity2 's water
