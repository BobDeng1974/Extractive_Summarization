former @entity1 manager @entity0 has heaped some of the blame for his @entity1 demise on the state of the pitch at @entity7			1
the 66 - year - old , who was sacked as manager of the south @entity11 club on sunday , endured a difficult four months , but says that he was not helped by the playing surface at @entity1 's home games			1
' @entity14 and @entity15 were disappointing performances [ 1 - 0 and 3 - 1 losses respectively ]			2
other than that , the pitch has been terrible at home , ' @entity0 told @entity22 's @entity21			1
' it 's not bad for the away team , playing once , but we 've kept it bad			2
they [ the @entity1 players ] could n't do the kilometres they 've done away from home			1
it was like running on sand , and that has hampered them			1
' @entity49 , the incoming @entity1 boss - as revealed by @entity50 on monday - will not suffer the same problem , as the @entity7 pitch was dug up after @entity53 , to be replaced before their next home game against @entity56 on january 10th			1
@entity0 went on to explain the other shortcomings he faced in his time at @entity1			1
@entity59 celebrates as @entity14 beat @entity1 1 - 0 at @entity7 at the start of december @entity0 also cited the defeat to @entity15 ( pictured ) as another low - point of @entity1 's season so far ' the infrastructure at @entity1 is very poor , but @entity49 will get time			1
the training ground is not in the best state			1
we thought we had a new one a few months ago , but that fell through			2
the chairman is working very hard			2
' all we wanted was a striker and a left - sided defender and we 've been looking for a while now			0
' when you look at the @entity40			0
i think they can do it , you know			0
i think @entity49 knows what he needs			0
i think they can finish as high as they did last year			0
now @entity0 has departed , @entity49 ( left ) will take the reins at @entity7 - his old club @entity49 ( right ) celebrates after scoring the winning goal for @entity1 in the @entity83 semi-final in 1990 ' quite honestly , you 've seen how we played at @entity56 and we 've played like that most games , we 've just been punished at home			1
' @entity0 was sacked with the @entity1 languishing in the bottom three of the @entity40			1
last season , with @entity91 at the helm , they were propelled to 12th , but have failed to find the same form this term			2
the departing manager though , is happy with the job he did at @entity7			1
@entity0 ( centre ) understands the criticism he received on @entity53 for taking off @entity100 @entity101 made a bold move by sacking @entity0 after four months , and has appointed @entity49 instead ' yes , absolutely			1
the @entity104 game i actually just changed the tactics because of the way @entity104 played			0
i was convinced we could go to @entity109 and win			0
i were disappointed not to go to @entity109 , i 've never had an opportunity to say goodbye to their fans			0
at both clubs , i did n't get much chance to bring in players			2
' ' the crowd had a right go at me ( on @entity53 )			0
i would have had a right go at me , taking @entity100 off at 3 - 0 down			0
his wife was having a baby and we had @entity109 48 hours later			0
there was a group that shouted , not thousands and thousands			0
there were no abuse at the end of the game , @entity1 fans have been great to me			2
' and so , that is that			0
@entity0 leaves @entity1 in the bottom three , but with high aspirations for the rest of the season			1
according to the @entity137 man , @entity49 is the right man to move the club forward			0
in fact , he told him that in august .			0

@entity0 blamed @entity1 's poor form on the @entity7 pitch
he says ' it was like running in sand ' , which has hampered the players
@entity0 also says @entity1 's infrastructure and training ground are poor
despite leaving them in the bottom three , @entity0 was happy with how he performed as manager at @entity1
