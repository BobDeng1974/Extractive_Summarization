by @entity0 wished you could hoover early in the morning but do n't want to wake the whole house up ? or want to pop the washing machine on at night but do n't want to keep your neighbours awake ? such dilemmas could soon be a thing of the past , as the launch of the world 's quietest vacuum heralds a wave of ' silent ' gadgets			1
here , @entity12 puts them to the test			1
hoping to do an early morning wash but worried about waking the whole house up ? there 's a hush - hush solution @entity19 @entity20 , £ 99.95 , decibels : 55 ( compared with average of 80 ) hairstylists love this hairdryer because they can still talk over its hum what it claims : improved motor technology means the average noise level of a hairdryer has been reduced from 100 decibels ten years ago to 80 or fewer - the level of a standard telephone dial tone and slightly quieter than the noise of city traffic from inside a sealed car			1
at 55 decibels , this is little more than a steady hum , which allows you to talk as you dry			2
@entity40 's verdict : hairstylists working behind the scenes at catwalk shows love this dryer because they can still speak over the small but powerful 2,100 - watt motor , which has two heat settings			1
i chatted to a friend happily while i dried my hair			2
the downside is that i became distracted and ended up with a ' do ' like @entity52			2
rating : perfect - especially if , like me , you have a teenage daughter who seems to use the hairdryer all day			2
8/10 stylish - but , at £ 120 , a costly way to buy a little peace and quiet kettle kitchenaid @entity58 , £ 119.95 , decibels : 60 ( average 80 ) what it claims : has a dual - wall construction like a @entity65 flask , with two skins and airspace inside that traps the sound and stops the angry bubbling noises made by most rapid - boil kettles			1
@entity40 's verdict : so stylish i could happily forgive it for whistling louder than @entity75			1
but i flick the button , wait for the boil crescendo and - nothing			2
there is a low , constant sound but not the angry bubbling i 'm used to			0
does kettle noise actually bother me , though ? at nearly £ 120 this is a costly way to buy a little peace and quiet			1
rating : the @entity84 of kettles - gorgeous but expensive ! 6/10 it 's not the smallest or lightest of hoovers , but it is very quiet @entity89 @entity90 , £ 249.99 , decibels : 66 ( average 86 ) what it claims : the quietest vacuum cleaner on the market - so quiet you can vacuum when the children are in bed and the tv is on			1
a new motor compresses the air intake to reduce sound			0
@entity40 's verdict : i scoffed at the tv ad showing a scientist wheeling this new - fangled vacuum around a sleeping tiger			1
but i tried it out at home while @entity110 , our spaniel cross , lay sleeping			0
he has a terror of vacuum cleaners , which means any vaccuming noise is made worse by the sound of his barking			1
but he did n't wake once			0
compared with my faithful @entity122 vacuum , this sounded as if it was producing half as much noise			1
it 's not the smallest or lightest model but would be perfect for anyone who lives in a flat or shares a house			1
no screech , and no scattering of children holding their ears rating : at last you can watch @entity134 and vacuum at the same time			1
10/10 @entity136 @entity138 cuisine 5200xl premium , £ 369.99 , decibels : 70 ( average 90 ) what it claims : the quietest food processor around			1
even on the chopping function , there is just a gentle whirr			0
winner of a prestigious @entity148 award from the @entity149			0
@entity40 's verdict : experts say that any sound above 85 decibels can damage the ear - so each time i use my trusty old @entity156 at home , i really am suffering : it registers more than 92 decibels and sounds like a helicopter landing in the garden			1
i place this @entity138 next to it and flick the switch			0
no screech , no scattering of children holding their ears			0
rating : used by tv chefs so they can talk to camera as they chop and blend			0
8/10 @entity169 so quiet , i could n't tell if it was running @entity172 , £ 575 , decibels : 38 ( average 52 ) what it claims : this clever machine takes more than 140 knives , forks , saucers and cups but is so quiet you 'll hardly know it 's on			1
it takes 132 minutes to complete a cycle			0
@entity40 's verdict : this has a time delay so you can set it going after midnight for lower energy costs , but it 's so quiet it wo n't wake the family			1
i tried mine during the day and could n't tell if it was running , so had to open the door to see ( getting a steam facial in the process )			0
rating : i like to know if my dishwasher is on			1
if you do n't mind a slightly louder one - 42 decibels - try the @entity200			0
this has a clever gadget that projects the remaining time and exact progress of the washing cycle onto your floor , so you do n't open it in mid-flow			0
5/10 noiseless , but also very expensive washing machine @entity212 , £ 999 , decibels : 49 normal wash , 73 spin ( average 55 and 88 ) what it claims : contains an extra-quiet mode to run your machine at a reduced noise level during quiet periods , such as at bedtime			1
uses a special wash rhythm that allows your clothes to soak and gently wash with less spin and noise			0
@entity40 's verdict : my washing machine screams the house down on spin cycle but this is so quiet i could sleep beside it			2
any washing machine will be quieter on a concrete floor than a wooden one			0
rating : very quiet but expensive			0
6/10 i was able to empty the ironing basket without missing a word of @entity239 @entity240 @entity241 , £ 300 , decibels : 30 ( average 60 ) what it claims : the quietest ever steam - generating iron			2
winner of an award from the @entity149			0
@entity40 's verdict : irons are not terribly noisy but can be annoying if you try to alleviate the drudgery by watching telly			2
steam generators work when you press a button by releasing steam via a pump from a water tank			0
this increases the steam but creates a loud rumbling noise followed by a bellow of steam			0
in contrast , this iron was almost completely silent			2
i was able to empty the ironing basket without missing a word of @entity239			0
rating : quiet even when you press the steam button - a silent dream			2

launch of the world 's quietest vacuum marks the arrival of ' silent ' gadgets
