fake @entity18 profiles were found to be posting malicious links to brand pages such as the @entity24 page			1
when these links were clicked on it would install a computer virus called the @entity28 onto the user 's pc here are six basic statements			0

you use @entity18 so much that it has had a negative impact on your job / studies			1
if you score 4 ( often ) or 5 ( always ) on at least four of these six points , then you could be addicted to @entity18			2
researchers tested a scientific scale on 423 students which measures how hooked users are			2
they found women are more at risk of addiction because of the social nature of the site			2
the @entity58 team found ambitious types are less likely to become addicted as they take advantage of the site for their own purposes , such as work and networking			0
the @entity66 lets users measure their dependency on the social networking site by answering six basic questions with how closely they reflect their behaviour			2
those who answer ‘ often ’ or ‘ very often ’ to at least four of the questions are considered addicted			0
the scale is based on the same six core elements of addiction used by doctors to identify alcoholics and drug users , the journal @entity80 said			0
lead researcher dr @entity81 , of the @entity83 ’s @entity82 , said addiction is more common among younger users			0
‘ we have also found that people who are anxious and socially insecure use @entity18 more than those with lower scores on those traits , ’ she added			2

@entity110 , of the @entity111 at @entity112 scanned users of social networks using @entity115 , and found that sharing information about themselves triggered the same neural pathways as food , money and sex			1

dr @entity81 said : ‘ the use of @entity18 has increased rapidly			2
' we are dealing with a subdivision of internet addiction connected to social media			0
’ some users , @entity18 can be as addictive as any drug - and now scientists have designed a simple test to root out addicts from ordinary users			1
occasionally doing this , for instance to try and encourage replies from business contacts , is fine			0
but a constant need to do this could border on addiction			0
the results from the student volunteers suggested @entity18 addiction was more common among younger adults and women rather than men			2
it was more prevalent among those who are ' anxious and socially insecure ' as they are often too introverted to speak in person but happy to maintain an online contact .			0
