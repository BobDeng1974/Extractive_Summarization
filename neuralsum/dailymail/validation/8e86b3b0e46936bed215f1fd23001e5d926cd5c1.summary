' @entity14 cried a lot to start with			2
i felt a bit bad about that			0
she was ok in the end though			0
it was just quite dark and atmospheric , and i think it gave her a fright			0
the tot takes a break and relaxes far way from all the fun of filming @entity3 ' but she loved the costume because she 's a typical girl who loves dressing up in long girly dresses			2
