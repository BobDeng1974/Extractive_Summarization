a month later the couple had a hole cut through his floor with a power saw while mr @entity52 was at home , and had his electricity cut off			1
a beam was also cut through in the belief that the property would be deemed unsafe and the tenants would be forced to move out			1
shocking : a tenant was at home when he realized a power saw was being used to cut a hole in his floor @entity80 : @entity52 had successfully fought eviction when the @entity50 had a large hole cut in his floor despite repeated demands from building inspectors for the beam to be repaired , the @entity50 refused			1

' the attorney for two of the other tenants called the @entity50 ' lawless landlords '			0
the couple had changed the locks on the apartment leased to @entity103 and @entity104 after they began paying a reduced rate because they were being overcharged under rent control law			1
after changing the locks , the @entity50 entered the apartment , dismantled furniture and stole $ 2,000 , a @entity112 watch and a phone			2
when mr @entity103 came home to find mr @entity116 , 38 , in his home , the landlord kicked him in the chest , according to the law suite			2
mrs @entity11 also broke into the apartment and poured ammonia on the tenants ' clothes and furniture			0

the couple also threatened the building manager with a semi-automatic weapon and ordered the windows to one of the apartments to be boarded up while the tenant was still inside			1
@entity138 , mr @entity116 's attorney , told @entity139 7 : ' he and his wife were naive when coming to a town like @entity1 , to try and do what they wanted to do , not realizing how tough the landlord tenant laws are here			2
' she added : ' they 're not saying their behavior was appropriate , they regret their behavior			0
' dangerous : the couple also had joists cut in the apartment building in their attempts to evict the tenants full house : when the @entity50 bought the apartment building in @entity37 it already had five tenants when the @entity50 were arrested in 2008 they posted bail and left the country			1
