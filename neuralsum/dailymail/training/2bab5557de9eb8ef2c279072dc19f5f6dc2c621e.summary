by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 13:27 est , 9 november 2012 @entity1 and @entity2 , who watched their £ 50,000 retirement dream wash down the @entity5 before smashing into a lock a devastated couple had to flee for their lives after their 60ft houseboat was washed down a river weir – because they forgot to sign up for flood warnings			1
@entity1 and @entity2 were returning cruising down the river during a relaxing break on the £ 50,000 river barge when conditions suddenly got dangerous			1
they were sailing along the @entity5 in @entity19 when heavy rain and rising water levels began to pull the 14 - tonne boat under the surface			1
the couple leapt off the sinking boat with their two dogs just in time , before watching in horror as strong currents caused their retirement - dream boat to smash into @entity31			1
the boat is being refloated today - more than a week after it sank - so that it can be moved and the river reopened			1
however boating experts already believe the vessel will never be river - going again			1
the couple said they had received no flood warnings or messages not to travel , despite torrential rain making the stretch of river unsafe for boats			1
crash : pumping operations are being used to recover the sunken narrowboat , which was submerged for over a week they thought they been added to the @entity50 's emergency warning system - but failed to realise boat owners must sign up for every river they travel on			1
mrs @entity53 , 58 , said : ‘ i feel so lucky to be alive			0
it came to the point when it was almost tilted completely over before i got off			0
accident : the narrowboat sank at @entity31 in @entity19 after conditions got difficult pumping out water : the narrowboat is refloated and safely moored so that the river can be reopened ‘ we would never do something that would be reckless			1
i did not receive any emails from the @entity65 alert telling us not to travel			0
‘ the flags at the lock were green and were not changed to red until after our boat sank			2
we are really , really upset			0
we had spent a lot of money doing it up to make it homely			0
’ the couple had remortgaged their home in @entity75 , @entity76 , to pay for the boat			1
stuck : the 60ft vessel hit the sluice gate on the @entity5 when water levels rose they bought it five years ago for £ 25,000 and ploughed another £ 15,000 into repainting it , fitting a fire , solar panels and decorating it			1
luckily , the couple say they have £ 40,000 of insurance cover and believe they will qualify for a payout because the @entity50 classify the damage as an accident			2
mr @entity93 said : ‘ rivers are so unpredictable			0
the water gushed in to the engine and cut out theelectricity			0
luckily the boat is insured			0
lucky escape : the narrowboat became wedged against a river sluice gate - fortunately its owners managed to escape before it started to sink ‘ but the only positive thing is that my wife and i are alive			1
she was on the back of the boat and could have been thrown in to the water and in to the sluice			0
‘ one of our dogs jumped off and i went back on to the boat to rescue the other one			0
the @entity50 said today that river users have to sign up for weather alerts for every waterway they travel on			2
a spokesman said : ‘ signing up for advice on one river does not give up updates for every anglian waterway			0
‘ people should make sure they are signed up for the specific river they are using			0
‘ a message was sent to every person signed up for @entity5 strong stream advice service at 9.30am on thursday , november 1			2
‘ the advice not to use the @entity5 on @entity65 was also in place from thursday morning			2
‘ the flag poles along the @entity5 are managed by unpaid volunteers			2
‘ warning signs are in place at various locations along the river , and they are deployed by @entity50 operatives who work their way along the waterway when strong stream advice is issued			0
