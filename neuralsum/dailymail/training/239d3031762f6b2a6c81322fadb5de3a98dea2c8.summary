by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 04:32 est , 21 november 2012 the owners of an iconic home used in @entity4 's film @entity3 have become so sick of it being a tourist attraction that they have erected a 6ft - fence around it			1
after 23 years of visits by film buffs , @entity10 and @entity11 decided to build the wall outside their @entity14 house where @entity16 's character lived in the 1958 thriller			1
the house is listed on websites as part of a film fan tour so over the past two decades the couple have had tourists eagerly lining up outside their home			2
but now the changes have annoyed @entity4 fans - they have also added a new entryway , and the @entity50 have put stucco over the brick chimney , reports the @entity53			1
their son @entity54 , who oversaw the design work , insists that when the job is completed , ' the house will retain the same feel			0
' ' i took the changes seriously , ' he said			0
' but this is n't historic value - it 's pop culture history			0
' ' the bottom line , ' said @entity67 , ' is it 's our house , we paid for it , we maintain it and we want to enjoy it			2
' film buffs : the house is listed on websites as part of a film fan tour so over the past two decades the couple have had tourists ringing their door bell hoping to catch a glimpse of the inside of the house changes : the alterations have annoyed @entity4 fans - the couple also added a new entryway , and the @entity50 have put stucco over the brick chimney the house is listed on @entity93 website which says : ' falling for the possessed woman act , @entity90 rescues @entity95 and takes her back to his apartment			1
@entity90 â€™s home stands , virtually unchanged , at 900 @entity29 on the corner of @entity99 , just at the foot of the series of famous hairpin bends on the " @entity103 " , which you 'll recognise from films such as @entity106			0
' the house was flagged for review as ' a potential historic resource ' - based partly on its age because it is over 60 years old and partly because it featured in the film			2
but it was waived because it was concluded the $ 15,000 work would n't cause any ' material impairment ' .			0

after 23 years , @entity67 and his wife , @entity116 , are sick of their @entity14 home being a tourist attraction
in *addition* to the 6 - foot wall across much of the front , the house has a new entryway , and they have put stucco over the brick chimney
