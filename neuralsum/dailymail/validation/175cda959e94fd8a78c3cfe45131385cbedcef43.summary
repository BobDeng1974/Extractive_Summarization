@entity1 's striking blue eyes water as bright sunlight floods into the @entity3 at @entity4 and he casts his mind back to a monday night in @entity6 almost 21 years ago			1
‘ that was the first time i met him , ’ he says			2
‘ he was a lot skinnier and younger looking , as we all were			2
it was my first year as an amateur and his first as a conditional because he ’d been riding on the flat in @entity14 for a couple of years			2
it was towards the end of the season and he ’d already ridden 70 - odd winners and i had 10			1
but even before that i ’d heard people saying “ this @entity22 rode a winner today , he was amazing ”			1
it takes very little time in the racing world for word to get around			2
he was getting horses to win that other people could n’t and all the people that you want to be talking about you were talking about him			2
’ if @entity32 had been a postman , a plumber or a professor , @entity1 would probably be talked about as the greatest jump jockey ever			1
he has been runner - up 15 of the 19 times @entity22 has been champion jockey and that figure will probably be 16 come the end of the season			1
@entity1 ’s tally of nearly 2,800 winners far outstrips the totals of giants of the game such as @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , all of whom won the title at least three times			1
@entity1 would be talked about as one of the greatest jump jockeys ever if it were n't for @entity32 @entity1 has finished runner - up to @entity22 in the race to be crowned champion jockey 15 times when @entity22 retires at the end of the season @entity1 , 37 , is favourite to finally achieve his dream but there is no hint of bitterness at the years of playing second fiddle			1
‘ my main ambition has always been to be champion jockey and @entity64 has been the thorn in my side for a long time , ’ he says			1
‘ but it ’s not his fault			2
it ’s my fault that i have n’t ridden more winners than him			1
i find it slightly strange when people say , “ now he ’s retired you can give it a real kick ”			2
i go for it every day of the week , every year			2
i ’ll start off the first day of next season as always			0
‘ obviously without @entity64 it ’s definitely going to help but you ’ve got a host of young jockeys like @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and older ones like @entity86 and @entity87 so there ’s going to be no easy run of it			0
’ @entity1 has ridden nearly 2,800 winners during his career but never been champion jockey @entity1 rides @entity93 as he wins @entity95 ' @entity94 at @entity96 @entity22 celebrates after winning the @entity97 on @entity98 in 2012 @entity22 has often credited the pressure @entity1 puts on him for motivating him to ride on wet winter evenings as well as at the big occasions like the @entity102			1
in 2009 he wrote : ‘ having @entity103 as an adversary has , more than anyone else , spurred me on to ride more winners			1
the threat of him beating me to the title has made me more driven			0
’ at this , @entity1 chuckles			1
‘ i ’m not sure about that , i ’ve just chased him a lot , ’ he says			0
‘ it ’s like running with @entity114 , he ’s just turning back and laughing as he ’s moving away			0
’ many of the great sporting rivalries of the past have been characterised by sniping and swiping			0
but @entity1 claims there is no room for that in racing , where jockeys know the perils every time they line up at the start and on a more basic level , they have to live with each other day in , day out			1
‘ the valets set up our gear every morning			0
it does n’t matter how many winners you ’ve ridden , it ’s how long you ’ve been riding			1
because we started at the same time we ’re usually sat next to or near each other			0
the longer you ’ve been there the closer you get to the door			0
he ’s been pushed out and i ’m going to be next to the door			0
@entity138 ridden by jockey @entity1 jumps the last to win @entity139 at @entity140 on friday @entity22 credited pressure from @entity1 as his motivation for riding so many winners ‘ through the winter when we ’re racing seven days a week there ’s every chance we ’ll be at the same meetings for days on end			1
i leave home at 4am and get back at 7pm			0
i rarely see my children [ @entity152 six , @entity153 three and @entity154 , one ] awake during the winter			0
i definitely see @entity64 more than my children and probably my wife , @entity157			0
’ @entity1 grew up on an arable and cattle farm in @entity159			1
he rode ponies as a child and as a teenager spent summers working at @entity165 ’s yard			0
‘ he offered me a job when i left school at 16 , ’ says @entity1 , ‘ i think my parents thought i ’d go for two years , see a bit of life then go to agricultural college and come back and be a farmer			1
’ he would read copies of the racing newspaper @entity175 , now defunct , at breakfast time			0
‘ @entity45 was from the same county so i looked up to him , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ when i understood racing a bit more @entity43 was the man i looked up to			0
he ’s still someone i look up to today			0
even though i ’ve won more races , to be champion jockey would make me feel i belong in that bracket			2
’ the @entity102 is live on @entity182			0
for tickets go to @entity184			0
