by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 14 may 2013 it ’s sad that it had to end like this for the vintage steam roller - but at least the pub is still standing			1
the operator of the 10 - ton machine was forced to crash into the historic 16th century @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , to avoid crushing a car that suddenly pulled out in front of him			1
the driver operating the ' lord @entity16 ' - plated vehicle hit the side wall of the @entity19 listed pub after the car turned onto a downhill road in front of him without warning			1
instead the hulking traction engine came off worse , with the roller collapsing to the ground after its iron casing sheared off in the collision			0
@entity26 had to be hosed over the black @entity28 steam roller to keep it cool while it took two hours to recover the machine by a mobile crane			2
the steam roller is thought to have been travelling at just 2mph after pulling away from traffic lights			0
witness @entity55 , 49 , spoke to the shocked steam roller operator afterwards , who told him he could have killed the car driver had he not taken the evasive action			1
badly damaged : the operator of the 10 - ton machine was forced to crash into the historic 16th century @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , to avoid crushing a car that suddenly pulled out in front of him crash : the driver operating the ' lord @entity16 ' - named vehicle swerved into the side wall of the @entity19 listed pub after the car turned onto a downhill road in front of him without warning mr @entity55 , a conservation adviser for @entity73 , said : ' i saw the aftermath of the accident and spoke to the guy driving the steam roller			1
‘ he said he was driving down the hill and somebody pulled out in front of him , probably thinking the steam roller was travelling very slowly			2
' there was n't that much damage to the building , mainly because it is made of @entity43 stone , but the front of the steam roller came clean off ' @entity55 , witness ' his option was to go straight into the back of the car and crush it or swerve into the pub. the machine did n't fail and it was n't driver error			1
' surprisingly there was n't that much damage to the building , mainly because it is made of @entity43 stone , but the front of the steam roller came clean off			1
’ @entity100 , manager of the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , said : ' i was in the flat upstairs when i heard a massive noise			1
the floorboards physically moved and i initially thought a bomb had gone off			0
' but then it went very quiet			0
about 30 seconds later my phone started ringing and a member of staff told me what had happened and that i should come and take a look			0
vehicle came off worse : the pub is made of robust local @entity43 stone and thankfully suffered little damage unusual sight : customers and staff in the pub reported feeling the building shake when the crash happened taken away : it took two hours to recover the machine by a mobile crane in @entity9 , @entity10 ' the steam roller was almost in half with damage that must cost thousands , yet there was almost no damage to the building apart from a bit of chipping			1
' the stuctural engineer has said everything is fine - it 's a very strong building which was built in 1549			0
' i was in the flat upstairs when i heard a massive noise			0
the floorboards physically moved and i initially thought a bomb had gone off ' @entity100 , manager of the @entity140 ' what i think happened is the steam roller stopped at the traffic lights nearby and was pulling away , so it ca n't be going more than 2mph			0
i think it misjudged the turning and then ploughed into the wall			0
' and @entity147 , who took photos of the crash , told @entity150 : ' i heard the steam roller coming down the road , so i took my four - year old daughter out into the street to have a look and take a picture			2
' we were standing at the exact point the roller hit the wall and moved out of the way at the last moment when i realised what was happening			2
' customers and staff inside the pub , which had recently reopened after refurbishment , reported feeling the building shake .			0
