he has been patiently waiting in the shadows for the right time to strike			1
now @entity3 has finally made his move , but does he still deliver that killer blow ? thankfully , within 15 minutes of soaking up the sights from the @entity9 engine , it ’s clear 47 has lost none of his edge			2
licence to kill : missions are varied and are teeming with interesting and life - like characters			1
hitman : @entity15 had a slightly cartoon - feel to it , with samey looking characters populating worlds that lacked soul and character			1
but realism is paramount in @entity23 , with levels inhabited with npcs that have personality			2
you ’ll hear people talking about arguments with their wives , playing guitars in their hotel rooms , confiding in friends – this is a living , breathing world like no other			1
this serves as a wonderful contrast to the death and destruction – and , disturbingly , reinforces a sense that you are taking a ‘ life ’ rather than eliminating a lifeless ‘ bot ’			2
environments are sumptuous , too , the highly - saturated colour palette giving the entire game a @entity48 - style sheen			1
whether it 's walking along the sun - kissed balcony of a beach - side villa , or exploring the dank , underground sewers below a nightclub , @entity23 brings each world to life with remarkable aplomb			1
the narrative is so strong ( involving a kidnap ) , that there ’s a reason for the variation , too – and loses that fragmented feel of its predecessor			1
indeed , this is perhaps the closest thing to playing @entity67 ’s taken that you ’re going to get			2
gameplay has also had a significant overhaul			2
you are still awarded points for creative kills but there is now much more choice			2
want to snipe a target ? you can			2
fancy getting up close and stabbing him in the back ? that 's possible , too - although it 's very difficult			1
you are encouraged to steal other people ’s clothes , but @entity85 can often see through them			2
agent 47 can use his ‘ instinct ’ to camouflage himself slightly , but characters are very hard to trick			1
initially , early levels may consist primarily of trial and error , as you get used to the rather ruthless @entity93			1
they also react realistically to your actions			0
in @entity15 , you were quickly shot in the head for going into an ‘ out of bounds ’ kitchen			0
here , you ’ll be warned off and given time to walk away			0
only if you stand there staring blankly at someone will they get angry and try to arrest you			0
this is made all the more convincing by the voice acting			0
although not uncommon to hear characters mutter the same phrases , as much care and attention has been put into the @entity85 ’ dialogue as it has the game ’s key players			1
waiting in the shadows : agent 47 can use disguises but sometimes stealth is the best approach agent 47 can also use his instinct to see through walls and identify targets			0
it generally works well , and is put to brilliant use in the point shooting mechanic			0
here , when multiple takedowns are needed , you can mark and execute targets – similar to in @entity128 : conviction			0
indeed , there ’s no sense of a mission being a failure if you ’re forced to use your weapons – unlike its predecessor which often resulted in a bloodbath if a hit did n’t go to plan			0
often killing the character who has sussed you out results in enemy suspicion and alertness to decrease or vanish			0
longevity is helped through each missions ’ carefully - intertwined sub-challenges			1
these range from collecting new weapons , to acquiring all of the disguises			0
they work well , although you never feel punished if you finish a level without all the loot @entity154 campaign mode will take most players around 10 hours , but thankfully contracts mode offers plenty more thrills			1
here , you play through the levels and assign three targets			0
you then compete online to get the highest score by assassinating them in whichever way you wish			0
take a risk or play it safe ? sometimes the most obvious path is the most dangerous			0
thankfully , levels offer lots of different ways to slip past potential threats unnoticed			1
but given the strength of @entity23 ’s campaign , it ’s hard for this not to feel slightly tacked on			1
still , this is the deadliest hitman yet that 's destined to be a hit			0
follow @entity176 on @entity177 : @ @entity178 and on @entity179 : @entity180 .			0

wonderfully dark narrative with *beautiful* graphics
lots of ways to complete ' hits ' backed up with clever *sub-mission* structure
varied environments , packed with ' living , breathing characters '
contracts adds some longevity , but may feel slightly tacked - on by some
@entity93 can be *unforgiving* at times
