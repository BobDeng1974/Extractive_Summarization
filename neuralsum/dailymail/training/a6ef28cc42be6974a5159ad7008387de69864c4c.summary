@entity0 , the father of @entity2 shooter , had n't spoken to his son for more than two years and his father is at a loss for what drove @entity7 to kill 20 students and six teachers at his old elementary school			1
a family friend told @entity12 that father @entity0 ' is as clueless as everybody ' as to what cause the boy to snap			1
@entity7 , 20 , had not spoken to his brother @entity16 or father for upwards of two years at the time of the shooting			1
@entity7 reportedly distanced himself from his father @entity21 when he started to become serious with his new girlfriend , and current wife			2
@entity21 and @entity7 's mother @entity24 split in 2001 but did not formally divorce until november 2008			1
court records made the split appear amicable as both parties agreed to put their sons needs above any bitterness , but @entity7 was apparently the one to cut ties with his father in 2010			1
trouble brewing : a new report claims that @entity34 cut off ties with his father @entity21 ( left ) when he began seriously dating his then - girlfriend and current wife @entity35 ( right ) in 2010 new life : @entity0 stopped visiting his son @entity7 in 2010 when he began living in this @entity39 house for the first nine years following the split , @entity21 visited @entity7 and @entity16 at their mother 's home in @entity44 from his new house in @entity39 , 45 minutes away			1
the @entity12 reports that @entity7 cut ties from his father in 2010 , right about the time that @entity21 began living with @entity35			1
@entity21 has been living with @entity35 in @entity39 for about three years and they married last year			0
overwhelmed with grief : @entity44 , @entity49 has finally laid the last victim to rest but the town continues to grieve as this woman looks for a place to lay her flowers remembering the victims : many of the memorials have included crosses for the @entity61 victims and @entity62 for the one @entity64 victim , @entity63 a sign hangs in @entity44 , @entity49 thanking first responders of the @entity2 shootings paying tribute : a couple looks on at one of the many memorials set up throughout @entity44 news of the inner - workings of the @entity0 family comes on the same day that they released a statement saying that a hoaxer pretended to be @entity77 , @entity7 's 24 - year - old brother and conducted an interview with the @entity79			1
the @entity79 conducted the interview over @entity82 chat with an account claiming to be the brother of the dead shooter			1
a number of quotes given to the paper included grammatical mistakes and spelling errors			0
in the chat , the hoaxer said that ' i am a victim ... i loss [ sic ] my mom and brother			2
' the so - called @entity77 posted two photos on @entity82 over the weekend , one of his brother @entity7 and one of his mother @entity24 - who was the first victim in the shooting spree - with emotional messages in the captions			1
' i will miss you bro			0
i will always love you as long as i live , ' he wrote under a picture of a then - teenaged @entity7			0
a similar sentiment went out to his mother , for whom he said ' i miss you mom			0
i love you so much			0
you will always be in my heart			0
' though this incident seemed unusual given it was the first time @entity16 formally spoke with a reporter , it was not the first time that he took to @entity82 to speak out about the case			2
on the day of the shooting , @entity16 initially posted denials of his involvement on @entity82			0
relations were not much better between @entity7 and his older brother @entity16 , 24 , as the paper revealed that the two brothers had not spoken since after @entity123 in 2010			1
at that time , @entity16 moved away to @entity124 , and though that is not terribly far from @entity49 , the two siblings do not appear to have been concerned about staying in touch			0
@entity16 was initially identified as the shooter in the crazed hours immediately following the shooting on friday december 14 when @entity7 killed his mother in their @entity49 home and then proceeded to kill 20 young children , six teachers and himself			1
because @entity7 had his brother 's identification on him at the time of the shooting , police initially announced that it was @entity77 who was the murderer			1
in reality , @entity16 was at work at financial firm @entity142 in @entity124 when television news reports began claiming he was the shooter			1
@entity0 quickly told his boss : ' i need to go			0
' he then walked out of his @entity149 office , according to a co-worker who spoke to @entity151 on condition of anonymity			0
thirty minutes later , @entity155 police officers stormed the office			0
between leaving his place of work and being taken in for questioning , @entity0 defended himself in a series of bizarre @entity82 posts when he was mistakenly named as the killer after his @entity163 was found at the scene			0
' everyone shut the f * * * up it was n't me , ' he insisted on his @entity82 page on friday			0
' i 'm on the bus home now it was n't me			0
it was n't me i was at work it was n't me			0
' @entity173 , a friend of @entity77 's , told the @entity174 that he sent @entity16 a @entity82 message friday asking what was going on and if he was alright			1
according to @entity173 , @entity0 's reply was something along the lines of : ' it was my brother			2
i think my mother is dead			0
' the relationship between @entity16 and his brother is one that will undoubtedly come to light as time goes on , but part of the reason why @entity16 was ruled out as a suspect in the shooting was because he has not seen his brother in over two years			2
mourning : a hoaxer pretending to be @entity77 ( left ) said that he will forever remember his brother @entity7 ( right ) who was responsible for 27 deaths and who killed himself during the @entity2 shooting real words : immediately after the shooting , @entity151 took a screengrab ( pictured above ) of @entity77 's @entity82 account where he spoke out saying that he had no connection to the actual shooting love : the hoaxer claiming to be @entity16 said that he loved his mother @entity24 , right , who was the first victim of the shooting and was killed in bed at her @entity44 home , left that absence does not seem to have made him any less loyal , however , as he now takes to @entity82 to criticize those who criticize his dead brother			1
for instance , when someone wrote on @entity16 's pace that his brother deserved to ' rot in hell ' and was the ' @entity217 ' , @entity16 responded by writing ' i am so tired of people blaming me or something my brother did			2
i love @entity7 , hes [ sic ] my brother			2
' @entity16 continued , saying that the person who commented was a stranger : ' he is calling my brother a monster when he do n't [ sic ] even know him ' .			2

hoaxer claiming to be @entity2 shooter @entity34 's brother @entity16 gave fake interview to reporter
said that he felt like a victim too and missed his mother and brother
the real @entity77 had not spoken to @entity7 in two years
comes as report says @entity7 cut off ties to his father @entity0 in 2010
