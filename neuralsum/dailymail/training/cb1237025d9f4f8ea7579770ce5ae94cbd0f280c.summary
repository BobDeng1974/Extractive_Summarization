@entity0 and @entity1 spent three decades building their version of paradise in the @entity5 , where they raised their five children and created a haven that survived two previous bushfire disasters			1
the couple ’s beloved home , with its picturesque garden and spectacular views that led it to become a local landmark that even featured in television commercials , was destroyed in minutes when the worst bushfires in decades tore through the region this week			1
the couple was on a beach holiday when they learned homes in the @entity5 were under threat , and then they received a phone call that every homeowner would dread – their place was among those destroyed			1
all the memories we made there , all my jewellery , our treasured things , just gone , ' @entity1 , 60 , told @entity52			1
' it was absolutely devastating , like a knife going in			2
even now it 's surreal , i ca n't quite put into words how it feels			0
' over 40 houses have been confirmed lost to the inferno , including the @entity1 ’ property			1
@entity0 , 70 , and @entity1 , 60 , had lived in their @entity38 property for 30 years , raising five children while living there and pouring countless hours of love into the creation of their perfect home which had survived @entity68 and @entity69 before it was taken away from them in a matter of minutes			1
' we were down at our beach shack at @entity74 two and half hours away when we found out there were fires up in the @entity5			1
our neighbours rang us to say they could see flames approaching the house , and we were just glued to the television screen trying to find out information , ' @entity1 told @entity52			1
happier times : this picture was taken while the couple were on a cruise last year to celebrate their birthdays ( 70 for @entity0 and 60 for @entity1 ) its picturesque garden was one of the main features of the georgeous house what was once a beautiful garden is now just scorched earth and ashes ' we knew that the fire was travelling really quickly and the wind changed and was really strong and just blew the fire back which made it rush up the gully towards our house			1
' it was in the firing line , the fire came up fast and hot , and the @entity107 had to pull back , there was n't anything they could do			0
' the fire consumed their property , including their custom - built pergola , prized garden , and fish pond , which had been the venue for photo - shoots , weddings , and even television advertisements			1
@entity1 's neighbour @entity119 was the one to break the news to them that the fire had completely destroyed their house , leaving nothing but rubble and ash			1
' @entity119 said it was the hardest phone call he 'd ever had to make , ' @entity1 said			1
' i 've never felt anything like it ; it 's almost worse than being told someone has died			0
i lost my dad recently and @entity0 lost his father , so this is just heartbreaking			1
' @entity0 and @entity1 did n't receive the official notification from authorities until saturday , but saw footage of their burnt house on the news , which @entity0 said was a shock			1
' i thought , @entity143 , that 's our house			2
we 'd seen photos of what it looked like so had some idea but it 's still shocking			0
it certainly hardened us up a bit , so we 're a bit more prepared for what we 'll see when we go back , ' @entity0 said			1
the house , which was built in 1966 , survived the @entity68 of 1983 and @entity69 in 2009 the fire grew very quickly making the @entity107 pull back			1
all they could do then was look on in horror the couple have still not seen their property , which for the moment sits desolate and amid a suburb of houses that were unbelievably unscathed by the fire			2
the house , which was built in 1966 , survived the @entity68 of 1983 and @entity69 in 2009 , but ' was no so lucky a third time , ' said @entity1			1
' to have to start all over again at 70 is quite daunting			0
we 've worked hard our whole lives , like so many people , and now i 'm not sure what we 'll do , ' she said			0
‘ we have had many people comment that it was a spiritual place and it had a very special effect on people when they would visit			0
we will really miss it			0
’ @entity1 ran a well - known curtain - making business from her custom built workshop at the back of the property , which made the loss ' a double whammy '			1
' i had two lovely ladies working part time for me who now do n't have jobs			0
they relied on that income and now i have to tell them that there 's nothing for them to come back to , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity0 said that trying to figure out where he and @entity1 would go was extremely difficult , made all harder by the vulnerability of their situation			1
' regrouping is going to be hard			0
i 'm not a young man anymore , and the uncertainty of it all , and feeling so fragile after working so hard is devastating , ' he said			0
@entity202 proud : for three decades the couple made the property in the @entity5 their home they both said that they 've been incredibly blessed by the love and generosity of their friends and family , and even strangers who have heard of their loss			1
' we 're both quite fiercely independent , so it 's been very humbling for people to be so loving when we felt most vulnerable , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's been hard to accept it , but we 've had offers of accommodation and food and clothing			0
we 've had so many beautiful things happen to us , ' said @entity1			1
@entity0 said that each time he explains what happened to the house he relives finding out about the loss all over again , which has made the ordeal even more emotionally draining			1
' we 've had so many people concerned about us and wanting to love us , but we find ourselves caught between our own emotions and the needs of other people , ' he said			0
' this has been an experience which brings you to a level you would n't normally go to			0
when someone dies , you go to a funeral and start the grieving process , but the land is still ours , so that shocking and devastating loss does n't go away			0
' but despite this , if anything , the disaster has brought the couple even closer together			0
' we are still very much in love , very solid , and this is n't going to change that at all , ' @entity0 said			1
the @entity253 are preparing for a walk through of their property on friday , and are using their beach shack as a ' home base ' to start to piece together the details of their life they still have in order			2
in ruins : all that stands of the house now are badly burned beams and pillars ' it will be part of the moving on process			2
it would be amazing if we could find something still left			0
if i found my pearls that would be a miracle , ' said @entity1			2
' we are luckier than most			0
we 've got some clothes and some other items down here , and it 's familiar so we feel somewhat safe			0
' we are so fortunate to be living in a country like @entity281 where we have a government that will look after us			0
we 're very conscious that would n't happen in other places and the spirit of community we have experienced has been amazing			0
' the region will rebuild of something as awful as this			0
out of the ashes a phoenix will rise and there will be good things to come out of something so horrible			0
' they said that they were so grateful to the firefighters and @entity107 volunteers who had been battling against the fires in the region , labelling them ' unsung heroes '			0
' they are just wonderful			0
we do n't even know their names but all the volunteers and police did the best for people they did n't even know and put their lives at risk to help others , ' @entity1 said			2
@entity0 and @entity1 said that despite the overwhelming devastation of their situation , the experience has taught them about how fragile life is			1
@entity1 ran a well - known curtain - making business from her custom built workshop at the back of the property			1
it also was destroyed ' life can change in an instant			2
you ca n't take anything in life for granted , ' @entity1 said			2
' we enjoyed that house and the garden so much			2
we got to sit out the back and watch the sun go down with a glass of white wine , and raise our children , and see our six grandchildren at all our family celebrations			0
' some people never get that			0
no fire or rain can take those memories away from us			0
' the bushfires that tore across the @entity5 over the last six days have been declared 95 per cent contained , with only two ‘ hotspot ’ areas of concern remaining			2
@entity107 chief officer @entity348 said interstate firefighters were heading home as the declaration of major emergency for the area had been rescinded			2
@entity354 has released a satellite image of the bushfires @entity281 bushfires captured by a @entity356 ( @entity356 ) on their @entity358 satellite the images show smoke billowing out across the @entity5 where infernos continues to rage through a sixth day			2
