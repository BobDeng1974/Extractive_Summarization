by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:11 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 26 may 2013 waving her arms and yelling , this is the moment @entity5 – dressed as the @entity6 – gave a band of drummers its marching orders			1
the actress admitted that she must have looked like a ‘ batty old woman ’ as she stormed out of the theatre where she was performing and told the noisy drumming troupe to shut up			1
video footage clearly shows the oscar - winner ’s furious gesticulations as she attempted to quieten the deafening throng outside @entity19 ’s @entity18			0
speaking to the @entity37 , she said something ' had to be done ' as the noise had been getting louder and she and fellow actor @entity41 could barely hear each other speak			2
she said : ' i was so upset from struggling through the scene with @entity41 that i literally walked straight off stage , straight up the stairs and straight out the stage door and banged my way through the crowd who were watching and said ' stop , you ’ve got to stop right now ’ only i might have used stronger language than that			0
' they were very sweet and stopped the minute they knew i was n’t just a batty old woman haranguing them on the streets of @entity58 on a saturday night			0
' angry : @entity5 , circled , storms out of the theatre to remonstrate with revellers outside the theatre no messing : it is unclear what the famous actress said during the confrontation which was caught on camera woman on a mission : the actress is seen in this blurred footage trying to encourage the crowd to be quiet reports of her exact words differ , but it is clear the 67 - year - old was , like @entity76 , not amused			1
some said she told the group to ‘ shut the * * * * up ’			2
one is not amused : @entity5 as @entity6 in play @entity80 others said she ‘ stomped out and shrieked “ quiet ! i ’m trying to do a play in here ! ” ’ dame @entity5 is playing the @entity6 in @entity80 , a play about the monarch ’s private weekly meetings with various prime ministers at @entity88			1

saturday night ’s @entity97 performance of the play was disturbed by the sound of drums five minutes before the interval			2
a troupe of performers marched past the theatre in a parade designed to promote as one in @entity107 , a festival for gay and transgender people due to take place in @entity19 this month			2
followed by a crowd of around 200 , the musicians and dancers stopped outside a bar to perform a drum crescendo – unaware they were drowning out dame @entity5 ’s lines			1
now dame @entity5 has revealed she would like to invite the performers to see her play			1
audience member @entity121 told the @entity122 that the actress finished the first half without letting the noise affect her performance			2
when the second half was interrupted by a lighting blackout , she went on stage and revealed she had dealt with the source of the noise			0
‘ she was a real pro , she saved the day , ’ said mr @entity121 , a 43 - year - old communications consultant from @entity131			0
‘ the noise was really irritating , but she did n’t get ruffled on stage			0
‘ in the interval i went out and tried to ask the drummers to move on , to no effect			0
i do n’t think they realised they could be heard inside the theatre			0
too loud : the band of drummers set to promote @entity139 festival as one in @entity107 , seen in @entity19 's @entity58 , close to the @entity18 , which prompted @entity5 to leave her performance @entity6 interrupted : dame @entity5 left the @entity18 in the interval to tell the drummers off ‘ i went back in without realising dame @entity5 had also been out			1
then in the second half the performance was halted for several minutes by a technical failure			0
‘ dame @entity5 came on stage and said , “ we ’re having a bad night ”			1
' she apologised for the noise and said , “ i went outside dressed as the @entity6 and told them , not too politely , to ‘ go away ’ as they were spoiling the play ”			1
’ mr @entity121 added : ‘ i have since heard that she was even less polite than we had imagined			0
’ writing on @entity155 , @entity154 said : ‘ brilliant – @entity5 , dressed as the @entity6 , stormed off stage last night and told a bunch of drummers to “ shut the * * * * up ”			1
’ miss @entity154 could not be contacted to verify whether she heard the exchange first - hand			0
one of the parade organisers said : ‘ she stomped out and shrieked , “ @entity162 ! i ’m trying to do a play in here ! people have paid a lot of money for tickets ”			0
’ yesterday a spokesman for as one in @entity107 offered @entity5 a free ticket to the event to apologise for the disturbance			2
