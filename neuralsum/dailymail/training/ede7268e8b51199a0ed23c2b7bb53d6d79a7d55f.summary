by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 19 february 2013 @entity2 : 08:03 est , 21 february 2013 the plane waiting to take off was filled with passengers and had £ 32million worth of diamonds in the hold			0
three minutes later the gems were gone – all the time it needed for a gang of robbers armed with machine guns to force their way in , seize them and escape			1
not a shot was fired and the passengers were apparently unaware of the drama until their flight was cancelled minutes later			1
once inside the hold they quickly located the 120 parcels of diamonds kept in a sealed container no bigger than a shoebox			0
it is understood that the gems had just been put on board			2
they had been brought to the airport in an armoured van which was still beside the @entity59 plane during the robbery			0
last night investigators had found the charred remains of the van most likely used in the heist but little else			0
brazen : an airport spokesman said the robbers made a hole in the perimeter fence and drove up to the @entity59 passenger plane , which was ready to leave , while wearing outfits that resembled police uniforms brazen : the gang threatened staff and seized two locked metal trunks containing the valuables as they were being loaded onto a @entity79 flight to @entity80 at around 8pm on monday night the gang ’s remarkable efficiency led to speculation last night that it could have been an inside job			1
they broke through the airport ’s perimeter fence using a @entity87 and an @entity88 around 20 minutes before the @entity90 plane bound for @entity80 was due to take off at 8pm on monday			1
they made a high - speed exit through the same hole in the fence			1
because many of the diamonds were uncut , the chances of recovering them are said to be very low			0
they had been transported from @entity99 where eight in ten of the world ’s rough diamonds are processed			1
great escape : the gang used two black cars in their raid , grabbed the cache of stones and sped off into the darkness , said @entity109 , spokeswoman for the @entity23 prosecutor 's office on alert : a truck from the security company @entity114 is seen at the airport 's cargo zone after the heist a decade ago , the @entity119 city of @entity99 , the world capital of diamond - cutting , was the scene of what was probably one of the biggest diamond heists in history			1
robbers took precious stones , jewels , gold and securities from the high - security vaults at @entity99 's @entity133 , yielding loot that police in 2003 estimated to be worth about $ 100 million			1
@entity99 's @entity136 stands in the heart of the high - surveillance diamond district where police and dozens of cameras work around the clock			1
security has been beefed up further since the spectacular 2003 robbery			2
but it is thought the goods stolen in monday 's raid , 30 miles away in @entity23 , may have belonged to those very traders who that security is trying to protect			1
prosecutors would not say who owned the diamonds or what they were worth			0
@entity119 state broadcaster @entity153 initially reported that the value was € 350million ( £ 300million )			0
a spokesman for the @entity157 later said the value may be closer to £ 32million			0
‘ in any case it ’s one of the biggest robberies we ’ve seen , ’ he added			0
@entity23 airport spokesman @entity163 could not explain how the area could be so vulnerable to theft			0
he said : ‘ we abide by the most stringent rules			0
’ @entity168 , a @entity169 aviation security consultant , said the lack of an immediate response to the security breach was concerning			2
he said : ‘ it does seem very worrying that someone can actually have the time to drive two vehicles on to the airport , effect the robbery , and drive out without being intercepted			0
’ a decade ago , robbers made off with valuables estimated to be worth £ 50million at the time from the vaults at @entity157			2
in 1983 , six robbers broke into the @entity114 ’s - @entity185 warehouse at @entity186 and made off with gold , diamonds and cash worth £ 26million			1
only two of the robbers were convicted and most of the gold was never recovered			2
precious : the robbers made off with a cluster of diamonds like this worth an estimated £ 32.3million ( $ 50m ) investigation : prosecutor 's office employees @entity109 and @entity199 update the media			2

eight men cut hole in security fence and burst through in fake police cars
gang were armed with machine guns , but seized gems without firing a shot
robbers sped off through same gap in fence just a few minutes later
thought stones belonged to diamond and gold traders in @entity99
