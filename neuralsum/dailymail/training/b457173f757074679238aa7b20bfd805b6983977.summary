by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 02:45 est , 27 november 2012 this is the hilarious moment an angry lioness launched herself at a huge lion - but ended up sitting on his head			1
this grumpy mum was n't best pleased when the lion tried to try to tame her cubs - and pounced straight at the enormous beast			1
but she obviously misjudged her distance - as she ended up sitting on top of the lion 's mane like a hat - before falling to the ground below			1
@entity16 hath no fury : the moment the lion luanched herself at the male to protect her cubs the lioness sprang from nowhere the minute she felt her cubs were under threat the outraged mother comically misjudged her distance and ended up on the lions head wildlife park ranger @entity26 captured the comic moment on camera , as he patrolled the @entity30 plains			1
@entity26 said : ' we had gone out to try and photograph some lions , and were met by a very playful pride of seven @entity34			1
' the four year old male @entity34 was playing with three young cubs - or rather , they were tormenting him , since all he wanted to do was have a rest			1
' the older male and a female were walking 20 metres from us , rubbing their heads every couple of seconds showing affection			0
' while watching them the other female appeared from the thicket			0
as soon as the 4 year old male saw the female , which is the mother of the cubs he was knocking over every now and again , he jumped up and jogged towards her			2
' it looked like she was just waiting for the right moment			0
she stood still until the last second			0
the lioness lost her grip eventually slipping from the head of the male the male lion paid little attention to the incident and strolled on after the mother fell to the ground ' as he was half a meter away , she pounced on him			2
she did loose her grip though and quickly fell to the other side of him			0
' with the female at his paws on the ground he just glanced down , as though to say : ' was that it ? '			0
' he just kept on walking past her and us sitting in the cruiser , and lay down to rest close to a thicket behind us			0
' the cubs quickly saw the opportunity of mum laying on her side , ran towards her and started suckling			2
