' despite naming @entity9 as a person of interest in the @entity79 case , it 's not clear just what authorities believe his connection is to the dog			1

' please be assured that these three agencies are working in concert to identify and hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the torture of @entity99			1

the two - year - old dog , found near a @entity28 play park , had been beaten , burned , starved and stabbed in the eyes in what was described as ' medieval ' torture animal rescue workers described the injuries inflicted on the pit bull , including a crude split to give it a forked serpent tongue , as the worst they had ever seen			1

when she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car , but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light			0
vet @entity147 - @entity146 was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog 's body			2
' her joints were pulled apart like medieval times , ' she said			2
' she was beaten , stabbed , burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life			2
' the vet added : ' when i saw how vulnerable she was and i understood immediately the duration of her suffering , my heart collapsed			0
' torture : the dog 's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart public outrage saw a number of tips come flooding in to help the @entity5 police department in tracking the perpetrator , along with thousands of dollars that had been set aside for a reward			1
the @entity91 of @entity6 offered $ 5,000 , followed by the @entity173 - based @entity172 put up $ 2,000			2

' in pain : the dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep horrified : @entity194 says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered although there was no evidence of sexual interference , which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases , the dog 's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly			0
despite the pain and suffering @entity99 had clearly experienced in her short life , staff at the rescue center said she was sweet natured			2
' within hours of being found she had pain medication , food and love			0
she experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life , ' dr @entity146 said , adding that the dog 's injuries were so severe she would have always been in pain if she had n't been put down			0
