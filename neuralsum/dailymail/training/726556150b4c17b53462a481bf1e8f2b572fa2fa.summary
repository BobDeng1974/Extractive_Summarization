by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 04:02 est , 15 january 2014 claims : the @entity6 leader insisted people 's expectations of well - paid jobs , decent pensions and home ownership had been ' undermined ' @entity11 ’s claim that he would be the champion of the middle classes if he won power was yesterday dismissed by critics who warned his plans would squeeze struggling families still further			1
mr @entity11 said the ‘ promise of @entity22 ’ would be restored by a @entity6 government that would boost the aspirations of a social class who had been let down for years			1
he insisted people ’s expectations of well - paid jobs , decent pensions and home ownership had been ‘ undermined ’			1
his remarks were seen as an attempt to broaden @entity6 ’s narrow focus on the cost of living , and address the perception that the party is chiefly concerned about the prospects of low - income households			1
but last night there were few indications of how mr @entity11 intends to fulfil his claim – or any acknowledgement that the last @entity6 government squeezed the middle class with more than 150 stealth tax rises			1
critics said his support for higher property taxes and environmental levies would hit many families further			0
mr @entity11 , in an article for the @entity46 , said he would produce specific policies to deliver higher living standards , with some expected in a speech on the economy later this week			2
‘ under @entity52 , life is getting tougher still , ’ he wrote			1
‘ our country can not succeed and become collectively better off unless @entity22 has a strong and vibrant middle class			1
indeed , the greatest challenge for our generation is how to tackle a crisis in living standards that has now become a crisis of confidence for middle - class families			1
’ on welfare , mr @entity11 said he wanted to ensure that ‘ the social security system rewards work and contribution ’ – which suggests @entity6 is still examining proposals to make benefits more generous for those who have paid taxes for a longer period			1
response : @entity74 chairman @entity73 said the only way to ensure a financial stable future is ' to stick to @entity52 's long - term economic plan ' tories said this would add billions to the welfare bill			1
a @entity82 source said : ‘ they oppose every single welfare cut and their new idea seems to be to spend more on welfare			2
the alternative would be to cut benefits elsewhere in the system , which their party would n’t support			0
’ future : treasury minister @entity92 said the important thing was having plans in place for long - term growth shadow cabinet office minister @entity97 said @entity6 could not put a figure on how many people were ‘ in the middle ’ , but added : ‘ you ’re talking about millions of families who are feeling deeply insecure now , who perhaps historically felt fairly secure			1
’ he said measures would include making banks lend more to small businesses and families			2
but @entity73 , the @entity74 chairman , said : ‘ the only way to ensure a better and more financially secure future for hard - working people and for their children is to stick to @entity52 ’s long - term economic plan			1
‘ but @entity11 has no plan			0
he has opposed every difficult decision we have taken to start turning our economy around			0
all he offers is more of the same old @entity6 policy that got us into a mess in the first place – more spending , more borrowing and more taxes			2
’ treasury minister @entity92 said : ‘ the important thing is that we have the conditions for long - term growth			1
that means making sure that we ’ve got a competitive economy , good infrastructure , a competitive tax system and so on			0
’ @entity128 , of the @entity130 think - tank , said : ‘ taxes and inflation are two of the key issues facing the middle class			1
proclaiming himself the saviour of the middle classes , he mentions jobs , housing , pensions and university education – in fact , anything but the two key issues affecting the middle class in the past five years			2
’ home affairs editor @entity146 considers the assertions made by @entity11 in the @entity46			0
@entity149 @entity150 : the middle class is being squeezed by a cost - of - living crisis as never before			1
reality : the timing of mr @entity11 ’s intervention was unfortunate			0
yesterday inflation fell to two per cent , hitting the @entity158 ’s target for the first time in four years			0
wages are predicted to grow 2.5 per cent this year , meaning the cost of living should now begin to fall			2
anxiety of the middle classes @entity150 : so many families feel a gnawing anxiety about what the future holds			0
millions never dreamt that life would be such a struggle			0
reality : while he correctly identifies with concerns , mr @entity11 ’s timing was again poor			0
yesterday a poll in the @entity174 found 52 per cent of voters are now confident about their financial position and ‘ ability to keep up with the cost of living ’ – the highest since october 2010			1
impact : critics said mr @entity11 's support for higher property taxes and environmental levies would hit many families further university students @entity150 : university tuition fees have trebled but even graduates often can not find decent jobs			2
reality : on monday , a survey of 100 big employers found there will be a 9 per cent rise in graduate recruitment this year – about 1,400 extra jobs			0
a grim retirement @entity150 : middle - income earners in their thirties and forties already know their pension entitlements are set to be less than those of the previous generation			0
reality : indisputably true , but what mr @entity11 fails to mention is that @entity6 is to blame			2
in 1997 , @entity204 abolished the @entity205 paid to pension funds and companies			0
it has been estimated this cost pension funds up to £ 150billion			0
home ownership @entity150 : the dream of home ownership seems more distant than at any time since the war : it now takes 22 years for an average earner to save a deposit for a first home , compared with just three years at the end of the last century			0
reality : under @entity6 , average prices rocketed from £ 68,085 in 1997 to £ 167,207 in 2010			2
the @entity219 says its help to buy scheme has already enabled 26,000 families to purchase homes			0
low - paid jobs @entity150 : in the past three years , half of new jobs have been in low - pay industries and the average worker is now £ 1,600 worse off than before the election			1
reality : mr @entity11 ignores the fact that wages are now rising at their fastest rate for six years , according to figures			0
where the blame lies @entity150 : our programme is rooted in an understanding that this crisis began before the @entity74 - led government came to power			2
reality : this is the only time in the 900 - word article when he even hints @entity6 might be to blame for the economic crisis			1
but he avoids directly mentioning the ruinous levels of spending and debt under the last government			0
and what he did n’t say ... the @entity6 government clobbered the middle classes like never before with repeated stealth taxes			1
@entity255 doubled ; the rate of fuel duty was raised 12 times ; @entity258 rose by £ 572 per family in real terms ; and between 1997 and 2010 , an extra 900,000 people were dragged into paying the top rate of tax ( a trend that has continued under the @entity219 ) .			0
