@entity0 are set to be without their two top strikers , @entity2 and @entity3 , for at least a month			1
last season ’s 26 - goal top scorer @entity2 is expected to be sidelined for four weeks after suffering a hamstring injury at @entity6 last weekend			1
and manager @entity7 dismissed reports suggesting that @entity3 , who weighed in with another 21 goals as @entity0 won promotion , is close to returning from the knee ligament injury he suffered in march			1
‘ it ’s factually wrong , ’ said the @entity0 boss			1
‘ @entity3 ’s just on his way back			1
there ’s certainly no rush on him			2
he ’s out on the grass and moving nicely , but he ’ll be under no pressure from us			2
@entity2 is out for at least a month with a hamstring injury as @entity0 operate with their top strikers @entity2 has a ' straightforward hamstring injury ' , says @entity0 boss @entity24 ‘ i ’m not thinking that he ’s thinking he ’s going to be ready in the next month , because he ’s not			1
@entity3 is not close to a return from a knee ligament injury , says @entity7 ‘ with @entity2 , it ’s a straightforward hamstring injury			1
it will heal naturally but we wo n’t put a timescale on it			1
we thought it was that but i ’m just pleased that scans showed something straightforward			2
’ the @entity0 are still waiting for their first win of the season after drawing at @entity6 last weekend when @entity36 had a late penalty saved			1
with @entity2 and @entity3 sidelined , @entity7 said that it will be up to the players who takes the next one			1
‘ normally the players ( decide ) amongst themselves , ’ he added			2
‘ last year with @entity2 and @entity3 , it was deemed that if one got tumbled over he took the penalty			1
but they both practised them			2
‘ you could tell from his whole body language last week that he was desperate to take it			2
he struck it well but the keeper made a great save			2
‘ you ’ve got to look at the people who want to take them			0
i ’m not going to demand someone takes them			0
i took one once and i did n’t want to take it , so i do n’t put anyone under pressure			0
’ despite the winless start , @entity7 insists that spirits remain high at @entity60 as they prepare to face @entity61 at home on saturday			1
‘ it ’s never a question of morale here , that ’s always good , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re close to getting our first win			0
we ’ve arguably deserved one and have n’t got one			0
the performance levels are good but i ’m not naive , we ’ve got to win games			0
@entity6 keeper @entity73 brilliantly saves a penalty from @entity0 's @entity36 ‘ i ’m only human			1
of course you want to lay your head down on saturday with your first win and three points are in the bag			0
‘ but it ’s the reality , the @entity81 , a step up , a hard task			0
we delivered a very good performance and missed a penalty , that ’s the obvious one			0
but it ’s nip and tuck and some games are like that			0
it was a good point away from home – we ca n’t be too greedy			0
‘ i put enough pressure on myself so outside opinion is not something i find too taxing			0
we do n’t want to be here for fluff – “ oh good old @entity0 ” – we want to achieve things			1
last year was promotion , this year is different			0
we ’re all learning and developing			0
