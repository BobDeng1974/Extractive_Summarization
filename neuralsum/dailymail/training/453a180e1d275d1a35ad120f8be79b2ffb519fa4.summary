by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 18:45 est , 10 december 2012 a deadly bug that has claimed thousands of lives around the world began in @entity5 , a study has found			1
scientists traced the origins of @entity8 ( @entity8 ) to two separate drug - resistant strains that emerged in the @entity10 and @entity11			1
both produce tough spores that spread easily over long distances - even between continents - and are hard to eradicate			2
however , the scientists said they did n't know if the bug spread due to international travel as they were following the trail of the pathogen rather than infected people			2
the strains , @entity22 and @entity23 , went on to spark a global epidemic in the early to mid 2000s			1
this map reveals how scientists believe it then spread around the @entity30 @entity8 is a bacterium that infects the gut , causing diarrhoea , fever and cramps			1
in some cases , infection can lead to life - threatening complications			0
those most at risk are people in hospital taking broad - spectrum antibiotics , those with serious underlying conditions and the elderly			0
however , at the height of the outbreak in 2006 , @entity44 , 32 , became the first healthy young person to die from the infection in @entity30			0
the mother from @entity50 died less than two weeks after having a son after a series of doctors failed to diagnose the superbug , which she picked up in hospital			0
by 2007 , there were almost 53,000 reported cases of @entity8 infection in @entity59			2
urgent counter measures taken against the bug saw the number of @entity59 cases fall dramatically to 17,414 in 2011			0
scientists writing in the journal @entity66 told how they used a global collection of samples from hospital patients to map the progress of both epidemic @entity8 strains			1
@entity8 is a bacterium ( see right ) that can cause diarrhoea , fever and cramps			2
it can lead to life - threatening infections to vulnerable patients in hospitals			2
c.diff spores are highly resistant to most cleaning materials , therefore hand washing is very important @entity44 , 32 , died from @entity8 in 2006 two weeks after giving birth to her son @entity82 lead researcher dr @entity83 , from the @entity84 in @entity85 , said : ' between 2002 and 2006 , we saw highly publicised outbreaks of @entity8 in hospitals across the @entity30 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity89			1
' we used advanced dna sequencing to determine the evolutionary history of this epidemic and the subsequent pattern of global spread			1
' we found that this outbreak came from two separate epidemic strains or lineages of @entity8 , @entity22 and @entity23 , both emerging from @entity5 over a very short period and rapidly spread between hospitals around the world			1
' co-author professor @entity101 , from the @entity102 , said until the early 2000s , the antibiotic fluoroquinoline was an effective treatment for @entity8			1
but the @entity5 strains both proved resistant to the drug , making it useless			1
' we 've seen that since these strains acquired resistance to this frontline antibiotic , not only is it now virtually useless against this organism , but resistance seems to have been a major factor in the continued evolution and persistence of these strains in hospitals and clinical settings , ' said @entity118			2
the first outbreak strain of @entity8 , @entity22 , originated in the @entity121 area of the @entity10 in 2001 and quickly spread across the country , before jumping to @entity123 and @entity124			1
it was followed by @entity23 which emerged in 2003 from the @entity127 area in @entity11 , and spread rapidly over a much wider area , covering the whole of @entity5 and reaching out to @entity89 and @entity130			1
clostridium difficile infection is a type of bacterial infection that can affect the digestive system			0
it most commonly affects people who are staying in hospital			0
the symptoms , that can range in severity , include diarrhoea , fever and painful abdominal cramps			0
it can also cause life threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel due to a build - up of gas			0
spores of the bacteria are passed out in faeces and can survive for months on surfaces			0
if you touch the contaminated surface and then your nose and mouth you can ingest it			0
it does n't cause problems in most healthy people but @entity8 can multiply and produce toxins in the guts of people taking antibiotics			0
treatment includes withdrawing the antibiotic causing the problem or using the antibiotics vancomycin or metronidazole			0
source : @entity171 tracking the spread of @entity8 to the @entity30 , the researchers pinpointed separate transmissions from @entity5 to @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			1
another transmission event brought the bug from continental @entity89 to @entity180 in @entity181			1
these events triggered large scale @entity8 outbreaks in many @entity30 hospitals			2
' we have exposed the ease and rapidity with which these fluoroquinolone - resistant @entity8 strains have transmitted across the world , ' said dr @entity190 , another member of the @entity84 team			1
' our research highlights how the global healthcare system is interconnected and how we all need to work together when an outbreak such as this occurs			0
' our study heralds a new era of forensic microbiology for the transmission tracking of this major global pathogen and will now help us understand at the genetic level how and why this pathogen has become so aggressive and transmissible worldwide			0
' this research will act as a database for clinical researchers to track the genomic changes in @entity207 difficile outbreaks			0

@entity8 sparked a global epidemic in hospitals in the early 2000s
bug started as two drug - resistant strains - one in @entity10 and one in @entity11
first strain hit thousands in @entity10 , @entity123 and @entity124
second strain spread to @entity5 , @entity89 and @entity130
