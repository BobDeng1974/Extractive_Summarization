a set of @entity2 instructions dating back to 1974 has emerged online which gently urged parents not to slap gender stereotypes onto their children			1
the pamphlet , which was posted to @entity7 on saturday and won widespread praise , reads : ' to parents ... a lot of boys like dolls houses			2
they 're more human than spaceships			0
a lot of girls prefer spaceships			0
they 're more exciting than dolls houses			0
' it concludes : ' the most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them			0
' winning praise : a photo of a set of @entity2 instructions dating back to 1974 was posted to @entity7 which gently urged parents not to slap gender stereotypes onto their children the uplifting instructions were posted by @entity36 _ , who claims it was found it at his or her partner 's grandmother 's house			1
initially , the photo aroused suspicions that it was fake , but @entity2 has since confirmed its authenticity			1
in a statement made to io9 , a company representative said : ' the text is from 1974 and was a part of a pamphlet showing a variety of @entity2 doll house products targeted girls aged 4 and up from the 1970 ’s			1
' the text remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been , and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world			0
' despite a great deal of approval for the 1974 instructions , however , many commentators argue that these gender - neutral ideals are no longer a part of the brand 's dna			1
popular angle : a @entity2 advert from the early 80s for ' @entity72 ' also positions itself as a brand for girls and boys alike ' it 's too bad @entity2 products are now packaged and marketed to specific gender roles , ' one @entity77 user wrote in response to a photo of the pamphlet			1
' they seem to have lost their way over the last 15 years , ' echoed another			0
indeed , the @entity87 - founded company , which was launched in 1932 , has landed itself in hot water a number of times in the past few years over issues of gender equality			2
in 2011 , it debuted its very pink - dominated @entity94 range , aimed at girls , which came with ads including such strap - lines as , ' cupcakes are ready ! ' and ' time to chill with the girls at the beauty shop ! ' times have changed : @entity2 sparked much criticism when it launched its girl - targeted @entity94 collection in 2011 for its patronizing gender stereotyping turn - around : the company then released its ' @entity107 ' collection in august ( pictured ) , featuring a female chemist , paleontologist and astronomer , which sold out in a matter of days earlier this year , a seven - year - old @entity112 girl called @entity113 wrote a letter to @entity2 which promptly went viral			1
in it , @entity115 complains of the few ' girl ' @entity2 characters , writing : ' all the girls did was sit at home , go to the beach , and shop , and they had no jobs			2
she added : ' but the boys went on adventures , worked , saved people ... even swam with sharks			0
' following an apology from @entity2 , the company released its ' @entity107 ' collection in august , featuring a female chemist , paleontologist and astronomer			2
none of the characters , it should be noted , wore pink ; and the $ 19.99 set sold out in a matter of days .			0

many commentators have pointed out that @entity2 products today are packaged and marketed to specific gender roles
