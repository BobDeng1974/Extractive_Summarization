by @entity0 for @entity1 orthopaedic surgeons in @entity3 have said they will not be able to deliver the same standard of care in an independent @entity3 and have attacked @entity6 ’s ‘ erroneous ’ claims about the @entity7			1
the @entity7 has been at the centre of the independence debate , as mr @entity6 has repeatedly claimed the only way to stop it being privatised is for @entity3 to break away from the @entity11			1
but in an open letter sent to @entity1 , @entity3 ’s orthopaedic surgeons strongly dispute that claim and have criticised mr @entity6 for his misleading statements			1
the orthopaedic surgeons say in the letter : ‘ we are concerned about the statements about privatisation of the @entity7 being used as an argument for voting ‘ yes ’			1
‘ we gather that there are still a number of people who may vote ‘ yes ’ because they feel they have to do so to save the @entity7			0
‘ as health is a completely devolved issue , this has allowed our health service to develop completely differently without interference from south of the border			1
’ in a poll of orthopedic surgeons from across the whole of @entity3 , 95 per cent did not consider there was any risk of an increase in privatisation with a ‘ no ’ vote			1
yet , worryingly , 90 per cent considered they would struggle to recruit and retain the same quality of clinical staff if @entity3 was independent			2
a group of @entity3 orthopedic surgeons have warned people not to vote yes because of @entity6 's claims about the @entity7 former prime minister @entity59 has threatened to stand for election to the @entity61 over @entity6 's lies even more concerning was that more than 85 per cent felt they would not be able to deliver the same standard of care to their patients			1
the letter , which is signed by a third of @entity3 's 180 orthopedic surgeons , added : ‘ the overwhelming majority of @entity3 orthopedic surgeons therefore are seriously worried that they will not be able to provide their patients with the same standard of care with independence			1
‘ people must decide how to vote in the next 48 hours , but the reason for voting yes should not be to save the @entity7 and indeed there is grave concern in our community that this would be to the detriment of patient care			2
’ @entity83 , a professor of @entity84 in @entity85 , said : ‘ the @entity86 say that you have got to vote ‘ yes ’ to save the @entity7 , but that seems to be entirely erroneous as health is a devolved issue			1
‘ what ’s so frustrating is that anything is being said to try and win the referendum , as if this was a standard election , yet this is far more than the selection of a political party for four or five years			0
’ it was leaked by senior @entity7 staff furious with claims from @entity99 campaigners that the @entity7 is under threat if @entity7 votes no. supporters : @entity3 nationalists both old and young gathered in @entity104 ahead of the referendum vote opposition : unionists also turned up at the event and expressed their anger over the issue light - hearted : a yes supporter with an enormous sticker covering her face earlier this month , former prime minister @entity59 threatened to stand for election to the @entity61 over @entity6 ’s ‘ lies ’ about the @entity7			1
the former prime minister said he would make a dramatic return to frontline politics north of the border to tackle the @entity86 head on			0
mr @entity59 said : ‘ the nationalists want you to believe that if an @entity124 prime minister sought to privatise the @entity7 in @entity3 or cut its budget , @entity3 would be powerless to prevent this from happening			2
@entity3 's health service will be at more risk of cuts in spending if @entity3 vote to leave the union , an independent report found			1
figures from the @entity134 showed @entity3 has been cutting health spending while there has been increases in funding in @entity124			2
@entity85 plans to cut @entity7 funding by 1.2 per cent next year compared to five years ago , the report found , while @entity124 is due to increase health spending by 4.4 per cent			0
as health spending is already devolved , the reports suggest the @entity3 government has placed ' less priority ' on funding the @entity7 than @entity145			1
it added : ' the @entity3 government has chosen to protect the @entity7 in @entity3 slightly less than it has been protected in @entity124			2
' @entity147 , @entity134 director , said it was hard to see how an independent @entity3 could spend more on the @entity7 than it could in a union where it will have significant tax raising powers			1
in the longer term , the fall in oil revenues and an ageing population could make for a tougher fiscal outlook for @entity3 than the rest of the @entity11			0
‘ they want you to believe that the @entity61 is powerless to act to safeguard our @entity7			0
‘ they want you to conclude that separation is the only answer if you care about the @entity7			0
this is a nationalist deception – a claim that does not stand up to the evidence and that is not supported by the facts			0
‘ what the nationalists do n’t tell you is that the @entity3 health service can not be privatised by @entity145 because all decisions about our nhs are made here in @entity3			2
the @entity61 , created by @entity175 in 1998 , has full control over our health service			0
elsewhere last week , @entity175 leader @entity178 claimed that an independent @entity3 would have to cut the @entity7 by the equivalent of 36,000 nurses due to the necessity of swingeing austerity			1
he urged @entity3 voters not to risk the future of the health service by taking a leap into the unknown - saying that thousands depend on @entity124 hospitals for ' life - saving treatment '			2
his pitch came after 200 @entity7 workers , including respected doctors , wrote an open letter arguing that the service can ' ill afford the cuts ' which would result in the event of a @entity99 vote on thursday			1
in the letter , employees of @entity7 - including academics , gps , consultants , porters , dentists , staff nurses , medical secretaries , pharmacists and trainees - spoke out against independence			0
they wrote : ‘ we love our @entity7 and believe that working for it , as we all do or have done , is both a privilege and an act of service to our fellow citizens			0
' we are living through tough financial times and can ill afford the additional cuts that would surely come should @entity3 choose the risk of independence ahead of the broad shoulders of the @entity11			0
' patients from @entity3 can access the care they need anywhere in the @entity11			0
@entity223 would , at best , put them at the back of the queue and specialties would need to be replicated here in @entity3 at huge additional cost			0
' preparations : staff at a polling station in @entity232 making the final arrangements ahead of the vote count thumbs up : but a group of surgeons has denounced @entity6 's plans for the @entity7 control over the @entity7 in @entity3 is currently devolved to the @entity3 government , led by mr @entity6 , and @entity145 politicians are powerless to meddle with the service			1
but the @entity86 points out that the @entity11 government retains overall control of the public finances , and could therefore reduce the amount of money available to fund @entity3 's public services			1
they have said the ‘ key gain ’ a ‘ yes ’ vote will give them is ‘ cast - iron protection ’ against knock - on effects from ‘ future @entity145 cuts ’			0
@entity255 , the health secretary in the @entity257 parliament , recently told @entity258 : ‘ the consequences of a no vote would be reduced budgets as a result of privatisation , patient charges , fragmented pay arrangements for health staff , with further pay restrictions and austerity as a matter of ideology south of the border			0
’ we are concerned about the statements about privatisation of the @entity7 being used as an argument for voting ‘ yes ’			0
i gather that there are still a number of people who may vote ‘ yes ’ because they feel they have to do so to save the @entity7			0
as health is a completely devolved issue , this has allowed our health service to develop completely differently without interference from south of the border			1
despite orthopaedic surgery often being the first component of health to be privatised , 95 % of a poll of orthopaedic surgeons from across the whole of @entity3 did not consider there was any risk of an increase in privatisation with a ‘ no ’ vote			2
however worryingly 90 % considered that we would have difficulty recruiting and retaining the same quality of clinical staff if @entity3 was independent and of even greater anxiety was that over 85 % were concerned that they would not be able to deliver the same level of care to their patients			2
the overwhelming majority of @entity3 orthopaedic surgeons therefore are seriously worried that they will not be able to provide their patients with the same standard of care with independence			2
people must decide how to vote in the next 48 hours , but the reason for voting yes should not be to save the @entity7 and indeed there is grave concern in our community that this would be to the detriment of patient care .			0
