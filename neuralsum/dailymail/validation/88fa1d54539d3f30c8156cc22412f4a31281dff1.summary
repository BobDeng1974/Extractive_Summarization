it is one of @entity3 's most popular tourist cities , where visitors flock to visit the nearby ruined temples of the @entity7 region			1
but while foreign visitors stay in luxury hotels and splash out of escorted trips to discover the delights of 12th - century temple @entity13 , families work in a rubbish dump just 18.6 miles away for a meager Â£ 1 a day			1
and now the rubbish site itself has piqued the curiosity of tourists , who have added a morbid visit of the site to their tour itineraries , so they can snap photos with the children working to sort the rubbish			2

she has worked at the site for a year and has seen many tour groups passing through the landfill site to photograph what they see a @entity31 tourist covers her mouth with her hands due to the strong smell caused by the mountains of toxic waste and decaying food the desperate photos showing the hard life of adults and children living and working at the site were taken by @entity44 filmmaker @entity43 , who visited the area to document child labour conditions in the country			1

he does not understand why tourists visit the garbage dump where he works , but he likes the sweets that tourists give him in recent years , the huge increase in @entity60 's population - in part to deal with the influx of tourists - has caused an exponential increase in the amount of rubbish taken to the dump site - causing even worse conditions for workers			1
local organisations have also noticed an increase in the number of tourists visiting to site out of curiosity , to photograph the poverty - stricken locals working to sort the rubbish			1
@entity43 explained : ' i went to @entity60 , where my colleague and friend @entity112 , a freelance photographer for @entity114 , had been developing a project over various years			1
he gave me the contacts i needed to enter the site			2
' while i was taking photos to demonstrate the realities of child labour , i realised tourists were arriving to visit , sometimes in buses and other times in tuk - tuks , @entity3 taxis , i thought it was horrible , and it should be reported			1
' in that moment , i changed my point of view and instead decided to report on the practice of tourism as one of the causes of slave labour , including child labour			1

her mother was who took her to the garbage dump to earn money when her father abandoned them while spending time talking to the 200 or so people living at the site , more of 50 of whom are children , @entity43 realised the rubbish dump was being offered as an alternative kind of tour to the usual temple visits			1
he told @entity176 : ' what disgusted me , what i did n't understand and what i do n't think is understandable is why these tourist visit places where children work , or visit orphanages where children have lost their parents			2
' it seems awful to me that tourists and people with money take part in this , from their position of privilege , show such contempt towards the inhabitants of the countries they visit and towards their human rights			2
' what is the most contemptuous , what we should n't allow under any circumstances , is that they use children like a some kind of entertainment , violating all their human rights in the process			0

' they earn their money separating paper , metal , plastic and all recyclable materials then having them weighed and sold to the company that controls the rubbish dump			0
' children and their parents are all landfill workers and spend 10 hours a day scavenging for rubbish and recyclable materials every day tons of organic and inorganic waste arrive in large trucks forming mountains of toxic compounds , between those mountains the inhabitants of the landfill seek recyclable materials such as glass , paper and metal with which earn money in recent years the garbage generated in @entity60 has doubled and the landfill capacity has been exceeded he added : ' i spoke to the locals about whether tourist visits were a rare occurrence			1
they told me that every day tourists arrive			0
hotels and tourists guides are offering trips as something exotic and different to the usual temple visits			2
nobody has banned these visits and the rubbish dump also charges visitors an entry fee			0
' dubbing the practice ' dirty tourism ' , @entity43 explains in the promotional materials for his work : ' around the world , the popularity of the routes of poverty , including orphanages , slums or landfills is growing			2
' these types of tours use children and their families for the economic benefit of the organizers , leading to greater exploitation and denigrate children as mere leisure objects			0
