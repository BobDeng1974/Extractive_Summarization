by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 13:15 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 16:42 est , 13 october 2013 a dramatic new blockbuster starring @entity4 paints cargo ship captain @entity5 as a hero , but some crewmembers say he was no leader and even blame him for the 2009 hijacking by @entity11 pirates that made him famous			1
the film version portrays @entity5 ' crew as layabouts who fell into the hands of pirates , the first time a @entity21 cargo ship was hijacked in 200 years , before @entity22 arrived to bail them out			1
but a recent lawsuit and firsthand account say just the opposite			0
' @entity5 was n’t the big leader like he is in the movie , ' says a crewman who served under the @entity5 , no doubt one of the 11 who are now suing @entity31 , the company that owns the ship , for nearly $ 50 million			1
telling a lie ? captain @entity5 ' story has been turned into a blockbuster film starring @entity4			1
but crew who were there during the 2009 @entity11 pirate saga allege that the hero @entity4 plays has little to do with the real @entity41 ' no one wants to sail with him , ' the anonymous sailor told the @entity44			1
the source said that 's because @entity5 has a reputation for being ' sullen and self - righteous ' and alleges that in april 2009 his arrogance led to the hijacking of the @entity21 - flagged @entity50			1
' the crew had begged captain @entity5 not to go so close to the @entity11 coast , ' @entity51 , the attorney who brought the claim , told the @entity44			1
' he told them he would n’t let pirates scare him or force him to sail away from the coast			0
' the lawsuit alleges that @entity5 was left an anti-piracy plan when he took command of the ship in march 2009			2
' shoot me ' : @entity4 plays the title role in @entity41 , and portrays the real life mariner as selfless and dedicated to his crew drama : the film dramatizes the april 2009 attack on the @entity50 , which ended with a @entity71 amphibous rescue of @entity5 , who was tied up but unhurt with the pirates in the ship 's tiny life boat ( pictured ) ' he did n’t want anything to do with it , because it was n’t his plan , ' the crew member claimed			1
' he was real arrogant			0
' his fault ? captain @entity5 became a hero in the press , wrote a book on the ordeal , and even met the president , but at least one crew member on the scene says he was actually the reason they were hijacked @entity5 denies such a plan existed			1
whether the plan existed or not , the crux of the suit lies in whether 57 - year - old @entity5 intentionally ignored repeated warnings that he keep the ship at least 600 miles from the @entity11 coast			1
the crew member said the ship was just 235 miles from the coast , while @entity5 has admitted to putting the ship around 300 miles from shore			2
either way , he has n't admitted to wrongdoing in the matter and is a witness for the defense in the case			0
an even bigger mischaracterization crewmembers see in @entity5 ' account and in the film is in the moment the captain says he gave himself up to the pirates to save his crew			2
' if you ’re gon na shoot somebody , shoot me ! ' @entity4 ' character says tells the pirates in the film			2
but crew members say it did n't happen that way at all			0
' we vowed we were going to take it to our graves , that we were n’t going to say anything , ' chief engineer @entity120 told @entity125 in 2010			0
' then we hear this pr stuff about him giving himself up			0
and the whole crew ’s like , " what ? " ' according to @entity120 and others , @entity5 never said that			0
when the crew tried to swap a pirate who @entity120 had taken hostage for @entity5 , the hijackers simply sped away with the captain			2
the crew would n't see their captain again until days later after a daring rescue by @entity22 , who found @entity5 tied up but unharmed in the ship 's life boat			2
@entity142 would later pen a book on the ordeal , one that paints him in a far more positive light than do his former mates			0
he would also go on to meet president @entity147 in the @entity148			0
director @entity149 said the movie was n't intended to tackle every twist and turn but defended the film and said it hews to the truth			0
however , @entity149 said : ‘ movies are not journalism			0
’ ' he was real arrogant ' : according to an anonymous crew member and a lawsuit against his company , it was captain @entity5 ' arrogant disregard for repeated warnings about pirates that got the ship hijacked			1

captain @entity5 has been labeled a hero after pirates took him hostage from the @entity50 , but a fellow sailor says that 's a lie
' @entity5 was n’t the big leader like he is in the movie ' : the captain played so *sympathetically* by @entity4 has been *accused* of putting the crew in *danger* with his self - righteous *attitude*
the film @entity41 *details* how @entity11 pirates hijacked a @entity21 cargo ship in 2009 for the the first time in 200 years
