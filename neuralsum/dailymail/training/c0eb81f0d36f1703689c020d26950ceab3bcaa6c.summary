by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 02:37 est , 17 may 2012 statement : @entity2 and @entity3 accusing a coroner of ' compounding ' their grief by banning their lawyer from asking key questions the parents of a baby killed by a falling lamppost spoke of their fury yesterday after a coroner ordered a jury to rule his death was an accident			1
@entity2 and @entity3 accused her of ' compounding ' their grief by banning their lawyer from asking key questions			1
@entity20 suffered fatal head injuries when the lamppost fell on to his pushchair five days after a workman cut through a supporting metal plate			1
he died in hospital 48 hours later , on the eve of his first birthday			1
mr and mrs @entity30 said they felt ' let down ' by coroner @entity32 , who they said refused to let their lawyer call witnesses from the council involved or question the workman			2
they had asked the coroner to give the jury the option of returning a verdict of unlawful killing , or an open verdict			2
but mrs @entity32 said the jury could only return a verdict of accidental death because there was not enough evidence to support anything else			0
outside the inquest , mrs @entity30 , 40 , a senior lawyer at finance firm @entity52 , said : ' we came here knowing it would be an extremely challenging time for us			2
' however , we did not expect our upset and anguish to be compounded by what we feel was the coroner ’s decision to exclude from consideration questions and evidence that might lead us to better understand how our son , @entity62 , was killed			1
portrait : mr @entity3 and his wife @entity65 with their son @entity66 who was killed by a lamppost which fell on top of his pram after its foundations were inadvertently severed happy family : @entity74 laughs during a photo shoot with his mother , @entity2 , and father , @entity65 ' we feel let down that crucial witnesses were not called or declined to answer questions			1
' mr @entity3 , 42 , a pilot , and his wife , who live in @entity83 , had a second son , @entity84 , born last september			1
their lawyer @entity85 , from law firm @entity87 , said the couple would launch legal action against those responsible for @entity62 ’s death			0
she claimed the inquest had missed questions including why no ‘ qualified engineer ’ was supervising the workman			1
the inquest heard workers were under pressure from the local council , the @entity99 of @entity100 , to complete a road - widening project in @entity83 , @entity103 , before voting began for the 2010 general election at the nearby town hall			1
tragedy : nanny @entity108 lies behind @entity74 's buggy in @entity83 , @entity103 a police officer removes the pram from the scene : @entity113 said she was wheeling the sleeping toddler past roadworks when she heard a ' hollow ' noise followed by a ' terrible scream ' @entity118 admitted cutting the plate and was found guilty of gross misconduct by his employer , construction firm @entity122 , and given a written warning			1
he told police : ' if i could take the place of that child , then i would			1
' @entity74 was struck by the lamppost while his nanny @entity113 waited to cross the road at traffic lights			2
@entity108 , 62 , was also hit as she pushed her granddaughter @entity133 in a pram next to @entity74			0
but mrs @entity32 said she would not invoke her powers to issue recommendations that councils should check the safety of lampposts because it would be expensive and ' burdensome '			0
she said : ' if i had thought there was any real evidence to support manslaughter or unlawful killing as a reasonable verdict , i would have felt obliged to refer it back to the @entity147 or the police , and i do n’t think that ’s the case			0
' she told the jury : ' the only conclusion i am in fact going to leave to you is that of accidental death			2
' the issue of statutory liability for health and safety matters is not for this court and i do not consider that there is any evidence of a gross error that could give rise to any other conclusion , be it neglect , negligence or indeed unlawful killing			0
' but she left the door open for the family to launch civil action over the death			0
respect : a couple look at flowers laid at the scene			0
nanny miss @entity113 tried to revive the little boy with mouth - to - mouth resuscitation but he never regained consciousness a @entity99 of @entity100 spokesman said : ' we would never compromise safety by placing pressure on council officers or contractors to rush to complete work			2
' this is not the first time mrs @entity32 has faced criticism over a ruling			0
in november 2005 , she ruled that @entity189 , 34 , who was killed by a blood infection days after giving birth , died from natural causes			1
this was despite a midwife ’s admission that at least one ' gross mistake ' was made in the mother ’s treatment			0
and in 2003 she came under fire for holding the inquest of @entity202 actress @entity201 , who plunged 40ft from a balcony after a drugs and drinks binge , without listing it so the public and press could attend , as is standard practice			0
she later said this was an oversight .			0
