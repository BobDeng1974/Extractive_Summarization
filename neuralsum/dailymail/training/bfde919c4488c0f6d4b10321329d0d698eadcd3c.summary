police officer @entity0 has said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into the shooting of @entity3 will find ' nothing ' and clear him just as a @entity6 grand jury did earlier this week			1
the @entity7 continues to pursue two investigations , one into potential civil rights violations by @entity10 when he shot dead 18 - year - old unarmed @entity3 in @entity11 , @entity6 , and one into the practices of the @entity13			1
during his interview with @entity15 on tuesday , @entity10 insisted he had never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career			1
' the training took over			2
' however , the @entity26 and the @entity7 are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations by @entity10 , and a broader inquiry has been launched into the police practices of the overwhelmingly white @entity11 force , which operates in a predominantly black community			1
attorney general @entity33 said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding , that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the @entity38 , and will remain so			1
' while the grand jury proceeding in @entity38 has concluded , the @entity7 's investigation into the shooting of @entity3 remains ongoing , ' attorney general @entity33 , 63 , said			1
it 's not over : federal investigations into the shooting of @entity3 will continue despite grand jury decision , attorney general @entity33 said in a statement after monday 's grand jury verdict ' in addition , the @entity7 continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the @entity51			1
' @entity10 , speaking to @entity15 ' @entity52 on tuesday , admitted that he 's worried about there being a federal criminal investigation , but is confident investigators will find ' nothing ' to suggest he broke the law			1
' i stand by what i did , ' he said			2
' i stand by my training , and just have to wait and see what they determine			2
' @entity52 asked @entity10 : ' you 're confident that no charges will be brought ? ' @entity10 responded , ' yeah			2
' to win a criminal conviction on civil rights charges , federal prosecutors would need to prove that @entity10 intended to violate @entity3 's rights when he shot and killed him on august 9			1
' the bar is very high , ' said @entity70 , a @entity71 law professor			2
she added , though , that federal prosecutors do not always see things the way local prosecutors do			0
the @entity7 are investigating whether it can be shown that officer @entity10 ( right ) willfully deprived 18 - year - old @entity3 ( left ) of his civil rights when he shot him several times while he was unarmed without a criminal indictment , @entity3 's family might have no better legal recourse than to sue local authorities over the teenager 's fatal shooting			1
after a @entity38 grand jury decided on monday not to indict officer @entity10 - and given the high bar to a federal criminal prosecution - the family may follow the path of other high - profile @entity90 police shootings and file a civil lawsuit for wrongful death or civil rights violations			1
in some such cases , the authorities who oversee police departments agree to settle for millions of dollars			0
' there might be a lot of political forces that would be at work that would give the @entity3 family a chance at a quick settlement , ' said @entity106 lawyer and former prosecutor @entity105			0
during his interview with @entity15 on tuesday , @entity10 insisted he had never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career the burden of proof in a @entity90 civil suit is lower than in a criminal case			1
a plaintiff needs to show liability only by the preponderance of the evidence , not beyond a reasonable doubt			0
in recent years , @entity106 agreed to pay $ 7.15 million to the family and friends of @entity122 ; @entity123 agreed to a $ 4.1 million settlement with the family of @entity126 ; and a @entity128 transit agency said it would pay $ 2.8 million to the family of @entity130 , according to news reports at the time			0
all three men were shot to death by police officers in cases that drew widespread attention but not murder convictions			0
@entity139 sued @entity140 after his videotaped 1991 beating by police , and a jury awarded him $ 3.8 million			0
' there are so few cases in which officers are criminally charged , but plenty of instances in which very successful civil rights cases are brought , ' said @entity151 , a @entity152 law professor			1
violence : police gathered on the streets of @entity11 on monday as protesters reacted after the announcement of the grand jury decision not to indict @entity11 police officer @entity0 in the death of @entity3 @entity161 , a lawyer for the @entity3 family , said on @entity163 on tuesday that the family was focused on the @entity7 investigation , not getting money from the city , but would explore legal options including a wrongful death lawsuit			1
' that will have its day , ' he said			0
@entity11 assistant city manager @entity172 declined to comment on any possible suit			0
if the family brought a civil lawsuit , a jury would essentially be asked to determine whether @entity10 acted ' reasonably ' when he shot @entity3 , @entity151 said			1
and although the grand jury appears to have accepted @entity10 's self - defense claims , that does not necessarily mean a trial jury would do so in a civil lawsuit , said @entity182 , a law professor and director of the criminal justice clinic at @entity185 in @entity186			1
the deadline to file a lawsuit would be two to five years , depending on the type of claim and whether it was under state or federal law , said @entity186 lawyer @entity194			2
the @entity7 continues to pursue two investigations , one into potential civil rights violations by officer @entity0 when he shot @entity3 and one into the practices of the @entity13 @entity3 's family members could sue @entity10 and city officials on behalf of either themselves , @entity3 's estate , or both			1
the suit could seek compensation for economic damages such as lost future income and funeral and burial expenses , as well as punitive damages , according to similar suits in past cases			0
the family could sue based on wrongful death or deprivation of civil rights , said @entity105 , who represented the estate of @entity216 in a wrongful death lawsuit against former athlete @entity218			2
after a jury acquitted @entity218 of murder , a civil jury in 1997 found him liable for the deaths of his former wife and her friend @entity224 and ordered @entity218 to pay $ 33.5 million in damages to the victims ' families			2
a claim on either theory would be difficult to win , @entity105 said , because of conflicting witness accounts and physical evidence @entity10 acted in self - defense			2
what other investigations are underway ? the @entity26 and the @entity7 are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations			1
investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution			0
whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges , @entity7 lawyers have a single focus : whether it can be shown that @entity10 willfully deprived @entity3 of his civil rights			1
that is a difficult burden to meet , especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force			0
some other past high - profile police shootings , including the 1999 killing of @entity254 in @entity106 , did not result in federal prosecutions			0
what about broader allegations of racial insensitivity on the part of the @entity11 police department ? beyond the shooting itself , the @entity7 is conducting a wide - reaching investigation into the practices of the entire department			0
that investigation is focusing on stops , searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department			0
it has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the @entity11 force			0
such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation			2
the @entity7 has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years , or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that			0
and regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation , there 's also the potential that @entity3 's family could file a wrongful - death lawsuit against @entity10			1
how long might these other investigations go on ? the @entity7 has not set a timeline for either investigation , though outgoing attorney general @entity33 has said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office			2
he said late on monday that that investigation was independent of the local probe , and that ' we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence			0
' how will authorities deal with any protests ? president @entity304 appealed for calm and understanding monday after the no - indictment announcement , saying the country needed ' to accept that this decision was the grand jury 's to make			1
' @entity33 , too , said the decision should not lead to violence			0
even so , within minutes of the announcement , crowds in the streets of @entity11 shattered windows , vandalized cars and taunted police while officers released smoke and pepper spray to disperse the gatherings			0
in anticipation of the protests , @entity6 gov. @entity323 pre-emptively declared a state of emergency and activated the @entity327			0
gun sales surged before the grand jury decision and some shop owners boarded up their stores			2
a federal law enforcement team has been working with top commanders in @entity11 and from neighboring police departments to help reduce tensions and build trust			1
are there longer - term efforts to deal with underlying problems ? @entity323 several days ago named 16 members to a panel aimed at helping the community heal after the shooting			0
the commission , which will study underlying social and economic conditions , is expected to make recommendations in a report due by september 2015 .			0

officer @entity10 said the investigation into whether he carried out a potential civil rights violation will find ' nothing '
he insisted that he has never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career
admitted he 's worried about the fact that there is a federal criminal investigation , but confident will come to same conclusion as grand jury
' i stand by what i did . i stand by my training , and just have to wait and see what they determine ' he said
