by @entity0 for @entity1 click here for all facts , stats and graphics from the big match at the @entity7 when @entity9 received the ball midway inside his own half , even he could not have dreamt how it would end			1
@entity14 ’s corner had been headed clear by @entity15 after 58 minutes and the big @entity17 striker was under pressure from @entity19			2
@entity9 turned the @entity20 and set off optimistically towards the @entity22 goal with very little support from his team - mates			1
substitute @entity25 positioned himself in @entity9 ’s path , hoping no doubt to hinder his progress , but he was left looking rather foolish as the former @entity30 striker simply accelerated past the stationary @entity31			1

ratings by @entity76 at the @entity7 still , it appeared as though he had taken the ball too wide of goal as @entity19 raced back to block the shot , but suddenly the ball was flying off his right boot and through the legs of goalkeeper @entity39			2
it was @entity9 ’s first goal since joining @entity34 this summer , and a wonderful one at that			1
@entity34 could hardly believe it themselves , and with good reason			2
to appreciate the magnitude of this result , you have only to consider the statistics			0
@entity34 had lost on all six of their previous @entity96 visits to the @entity7 , failing to score so much as a single goal			1
the aggregate score was 15 - 0			0
@entity22 , on the other hand , only lost once here in the league throughout last season and that was to @entity104			1
the two defeats mark the only occasions on which they have failed to score in 71 home league games			2
the champions will claim that they should have had one , possibly two , penalties in the second half after the ball ricocheted off @entity56 and struck @entity15 on the hand from close range before @entity44 was brought down by @entity58 towards the end			0
‘ all of you know that it was a clear penalty , ’ said city manager @entity32 of the second incident			0
however , @entity34 had a decent appeal of their own turned down by referee @entity73 in the first half when @entity9 tangled with @entity19 and then went down under the defender ’s untidy challenge			1
‘ people are saying that theirs was a good call for a penalty but i saw the one that we should have had in the first half , ’ said @entity34 manager @entity124			1
the @entity131 has not enjoyed the happiest of returns to the @entity7 since he was unceremoniously sacked in 2009			2
the best of it was a point with @entity137			0
even beating relegation with @entity139 was tainted by having to see his successor , @entity140 , snatch the title on the last day of the season			0
@entity32 managed it in his first season in @entity146 but the @entity147 will be concerned at his team ’s lethargy at times on saturday			0
they lacked the cutting edge that saw off @entity152 so convincingly last monday , creating only a handful of chances that fell to the wasteful @entity44			0
finish : @entity9 slotted past @entity39 after a swift counter attack as @entity22 suffered a rare home defeat in the @entity96 decisive : @entity25 watches on as @entity39 is beaten by @entity9 's shot which was enough to earn victory for @entity34 red devil : @entity9 was on the books of @entity30 between 2009 and 2012 , but scored just one goal in five league appearances delight : @entity34 celebrate @entity9 's winner as their fans dance with delight in the away end at the @entity7 mins @entity168 @entity22 total 105.7 65.5 @entity14 90 10.9 6.8 @entity44 90 10.8 6.7 @entity19 90 10.7 6.6 @entity34 total 109.0 67.7 @entity65 90 11.4 7.1 @entity9 90 10.9 6.8 @entity63 90 10.6 6.6 data courtesy of the @entity170 , the @entity171 of the @entity96 despite the attacking options available to him , @entity32 acknowledged that he now has 48 hours before the transfer window closes to add to his squad			1
whether that involves as @entity177 striker @entity176 remains to be seen			0
but @entity22 were held at bay too easily here by a @entity34 side with two stubborn banks of four and a typically tenacious attitude aimed at knocking their opponents out of their stride			1
the game was only a few minutes old when @entity49 went down and stayed there after colliding with @entity57 as he spun past the @entity34 skipper			2
@entity56 was booked for going through the back of @entity14 who then clashed with @entity57 and was more than happy to see @entity47 go into battle with the big defender on his behalf			0
@entity22 also lost @entity43 before half - time when their new £ 14million signing limped off with a groin injury following a challenge with @entity62			2
@entity44 covered a lot of ground , as his heat @entity200 ( below ) , but could n't help @entity22 avoid @entity201 @entity202 returns : @entity34 manager @entity124 celebrates victory against his former club at the @entity7 despair : @entity22 captain @entity41 ( left ) and manager @entity32 ( right ) react to their home defeat despondent : the loss ended @entity22 's 100 per cent start the season after the champions beat @entity212 and @entity152 their best chance arrived in stoppage time at the end of the half when @entity49 twisted and turned around the penalty box before releasing @entity19 on the overlap			1
the @entity20 ’s low cross picked out @entity44 who met it with a first - time effort with his left foot that clipped @entity55 ’s bar			0
@entity44 had two more good chances in the second half , one of which brought the reflex save from @entity55 , and one that led indirectly to @entity34 ’s winning goal on the counter attack			1
they had to do more than their fair share of defending to keep the lead and it was n’t particularly pretty			0
but @entity124 is slowly introducing the passing game that persuaded his employers to choose him as @entity240 ’s replacement , and at times they looked almost comfortable against the @entity96 champions			1
‘ we ’re @entity34 , we ’re passing the ball , ’ sang their supporters as the @entity244 played their way out of trouble in the dying minutes			2
back at the @entity7 and on the brink of victory , it was music to @entity124 ’s ears			1
challenge : @entity22 striker @entity47 is tackled by @entity34 's @entity62 physical : @entity34 's @entity63 and @entity22 midfielder @entity45 battle for possession of the ball on the run : @entity22 's @entity259 midfielder @entity44 evades the challenge of @entity34 's @entity63 reach : @entity34 goalkeeper @entity55 smothers a shot from @entity262 striker @entity49 strength : @entity22 captain @entity41 tries to hold off @entity34 's @entity265 flashpoint : @entity22 forward @entity47 exchanges words with @entity34 defender @entity57			1
