when @entity1 planted an awkward kiss on an unwitting @entity3 at the @entity4 on sunday evening , the surrounding paparazzi swiftly captured the fist - gnawingly awful moment in its full glory			1
@entity3 's icy stare spoke volumes as @entity1 snaked an arm around her svelte waist and brushed his lips against her cheek , and promptly sent the @entity13 into a frenzy of @entity1 - related memes			2
but it seems the @entity18 actor is n't the only one guilty of mistiming a smooch			1

he says : ' in social situations , a man should take the lead from the woman as to how they will greet			2
' sadly women do n't know now that they need to make the first move , as it were			2
if the woman extends her hand then that means the pair will shake hands			0
if she opens her arms wide , there will be a hug , and so on			0
' it 's hard enough for couples who are comfortable in each others ' presence but greeting an acquaintance can also throw up squirming situations			0

' he adds : ' while across the pond in @entity142 social kissing is not as popular although it is seen more in @entity144 and @entity34			0
and if you get stuck - simple extend a hand and forget the kiss altogether			0
' political mishaps : the @entity149 ( left ) usually have great chemistry but this kiss falls short of the mark and ( right ) @entity154 leader @entity153 tries to wave and kiss at the same time ... with dismal consequences @entity156 appeared to be aiming for @entity158 's eye in this clinch at the @entity161 premiere in @entity18 in 2001 @entity162 and @entity163 both look confused with what 's happening in this smooch at the ' @entity167 ' film premiere in @entity34 in 2012 is @entity168 looking so intense because she 's wondering where husband @entity82 's hand has disappeared to ? the former @entity142 footballer and his wife look like they 'd need a crowbar to separate them and squeeeeeze ! @entity176 ( left ) is n't letting wife @entity177 get away while ( right ) @entity178 soaks up a lunging kiss from @entity180 at the @entity181 7 premier in 2014 etiquette consultant @entity107 offers some sage advice on how to handle public displays of affection with lovers , close friends and mere acquaintances ... how not to do it : @entity190 and @entity191 missed the kissing target during a polo match in @entity194 in 1992			1
