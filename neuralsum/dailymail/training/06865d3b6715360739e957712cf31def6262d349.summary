by @entity1 reporter published : 12:21 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 18:09 est , 1 october 2013 a growing number of spoof videos of men pretending to pick up women in bizarre ways have appeared on @entity7 , including one where nude man wanders the streets with an erection asking for phone numbers			1
while some say the trend displays harassing behavior , others think it 's just good fun			1
as shocking as their behavior appears , these men have a surprising success rate			1
@entity21 : as part of a trend in @entity7 videos where men ask women out in odd ways , @entity22 asks women for their numbers while nude by far the most forward of all these videos is naked @entity32			1
the title of the spoof says it all : a naked man who calls himself @entity37 approaches women on the street and asks for their number			1
not surprisingly , most of the women looks completely shocked			2
a helper stands by with a microphone to get the women 's reactions			2
some immediately turn around and walk away , gasp , and one duo of girls yelps , ' @entity50 s * * t ! ' grossed out : the grave gentleman approaches several women , most of whom react with shock and dismay ' you can have my number if you 'd like ' : oddly enough , some of the prankster 's targets warm up to him video source @entity7 most of the women make their disinterest known			1
' many of the women he ambushes laugh it off , ' writes the @entity70			2
' but that does n’t make his invasion of women ’s space any less troubling			0
' nevertheless , some actually warm up to the naked man			1
' you can have my number if you like , ' says one woman			0
@entity37 approaches another group of women who he apparently especially likes			0
' i 'm actually standing here having a boner , ' he tells as just laugh at him			0
' you turn me on			0
is it visible ? i do n't want to look			0
' another spoof , from @entity85 , features a similar stunt			1
clothed men walk around asking women for their numbers while outfitted with prosthetic erections			1
shocker : in another spoof , men wearing prosthetic erections approach women and ask for their phone numbers ' i 'm gon na throw up ' : while most of the women laugh off the prank , some were suitably offended ' can i have your number , ' asks one of the men			1
' no , ' the girls says			0
' i 'm gon na throw up , ' says her friend			0
they 're the exceptions in what the jokesters call an ' experiment , ' at least in the women they chose to include in the spoof			2
many of the women gladly give the men a phone number			2
whether or not it is the girl 's number remains unclear			0
' this experiment is null and void , ' writes @entity7 user @entity121 , ' without the actual statistics of ﻿ how many women put their real phone number in the phone			0

naked @entity32 video part of a pickup video spoof trend that some are calling *sexual* harassment
other videos feature clothed men with fake erections and men giving *uninvited* *kisses*
