@entity0 fell in love with her husband @entity2 after she was attacked by a doberman while canvassing on his behalf - even though she had been ' furious ' with him after a bungled first date			1
mrs @entity0 , 44 , has revealed that she first met the @entity5 at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend and thought he was ' good looking ' and ' unattached '			1
but the @entity9 leader failed to tell his future wife that he was secretly going out with their ' mutual friend ' - understood to be the former @entity14 economics editor @entity13			1
worse still , the politician persisted in trying to bore his future wife with constant talk of economics , which she ca n't stand			1
in an interview with the @entity33 , mrs @entity0 said : ' canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with @entity2 in 2005			1
' i had never been out leafleting before and did n't realise you had to keep your eye out for dogs on the other side of the letterbox			0
' i 'd been bitten by a doberman			0
@entity2 bandaged me up and i fell in love with him			0
' the doberman incident happened while canvassing in mr @entity46 's constituency in @entity47			1
however , mr @entity46 almost doomed the couple 's relationship on their first encounter after he failed to reveal that he was already in a relationship			1
she said : ' i thought he was good looking and clever and seemed to be unattached			0
but we just went down a conversational cul - de - sac			0
' apparently we had nothing in common			0
he wanted to talk about economics – one of my least favourite subjects			2
none of our conversations went anywhere			0
' the unpromising start to their relationship was compounded when she found out he had been going out with the woman who invited them to dinner			2
she said : ' i found out he was secretly going out with the woman who had invited us for dinner			2
' i bumped into him a couple of times after that , but we did n’t start seeing each other for at least a year			0
' mrs @entity0 said she first met the @entity5 at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend - understood to be the former @entity14 economics editor - who @entity2 was secretly in a relationship with mrs @entity0 said neither her or her husband are bothered about the ' kitchengate ' controversy when it emerged the couple had two kitchens - or ' bacongate ' when mr @entity46 was caught struggling to each a sandwich the couple have two children , @entity93 and @entity94			1
however , mrs @entity0 , who is a lawyer , said she has no intention of giving up her job in the event her husband is elected prime minister			1
she said she was ' genuinely taken aback ' by the suggestion			0
mrs @entity0 said she has been surprised by some people 's obsession with their domestic arrangements			1
she added : ' with kitchengate , i was just amazed at the ink being spilled			2
i ca n't get upset about things like that when people are having terrible lives in this country and around the world			0
' there are things in politics that are really serious and then there 's lots of other stuff			2
it 's partly why @entity2 and i get on so well			2
both of us could n't care less about kitchengate or bacon buttygate			0

@entity46 bored his future wife @entity124 on their first meeting at a party
the @entity9 leader *discussed* economics when she had little interest
he then failed to tell her that he was going out with the dinner party 's host
mrs @entity0 said she and her husband are not *interested* in ' kitchengate '
