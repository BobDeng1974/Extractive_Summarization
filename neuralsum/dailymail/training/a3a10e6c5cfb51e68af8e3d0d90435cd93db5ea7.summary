@entity0 began this summer wanting pace , bounce and carry in their @entity4 pitches but have instead been confronted with surfaces more akin to @entity7 and @entity8 than @entity9 ’s , @entity10 and @entity11			1
the result on wednesday was that @entity13 felt very much at home on the first day of a pivotal series for @entity16			1
certainly there was no home advantage in @entity19 for @entity0 on a low , slow batting paradise of a pitch that was prepared more to ensure that the first @entity22 will last into the weekend rather than produce compelling cricket			2
@entity24 never gives much away but the @entity13 coach would have been inwardly grinning like a @entity27 cat behind his inscrutable façade at the warm hospitality offered to his side here by his old employers at the @entity33			2
@entity38 averages 18 outside of @entity13 but here he was able to record his first test century away from his home country even though @entity0 did pretty much all they could to keep their opponents within reach			1
@entity34 and @entity63 have fabulous records at @entity11 but with the ball refusing to swing other than for an all too brief spell of reverse after lunch this was every bit as tough for them as @entity73 ’s famous victory in @entity74			1
@entity0 , to be fair , had a pretty good day but still ended it with @entity13 on 259 for four and if this is the way it will be for a five - @entity22 series that will be crammed into just 42 days then there will be some exhausted bowlers by the end of it			1
breakthrough : on a tough day for @entity0 's pace attack @entity34 took wickets in quick succession short stuff : @entity87 evades a bouncer from @entity34 before falling to a similar ball from @entity90 put down : @entity16 puts down a chance at silly point from @entity87 that is if any bowlers are still standing by then			1
the first casualty of a punishing itinerary came on the very first day when @entity98 , returning to the @entity0 side , appeared to suffer a side injury pushing himself through the dirt			2
@entity101 will not be the last if the @entity22 venues continue to put the bottom line before the need to produce more of an even contest between bat and ball , let alone the wishes of a national side who ultimately pay domestic cricket ’s bills			0
new drainage systems and the heavy roller are being blamed for lifeless @entity116 pitches but far more pertinent is the @entity33 ’s prohibitive bidding system for tests that sees counties paying huge fees to stage matches			0
tests have to last five days for any county to make a profit from big matches			0
@entity63 was seen in animated conversation with @entity11 groundsman @entity127 on tuesday , apparently questioning the look of the pitch , and his worst fears were realised by this lifeless , soul - destroying 22 yards of turf			2
taking the strain : there were fears @entity98 had succumbed to a side injury on day one comeback : @entity98 returned to the attack late in the day but flat wickets it could take a toll on @entity0 's quicks there must be some guilt at @entity11 because @entity127 took the almost unprecedented step of admitting he had got things wrong in his preparation			1
‘ we wanted to produce a pitch with pace , bounce and carry but unfortunately it has n’t happened , ’ said @entity127 on day one			0
‘ there ’s quite a lot of moisture underneath but it ’s a hard surface on top which is why it ’s lacking pace			0
‘ our only instruction is to produce a good cricket wicket and , with hindsight , we may have left a bit more grass on it but this is the first day of a five - day test and we hope it might quicken up a bit			1
’ @entity0 , not to mention spectators seeking value for money , will hope he is right			0
‘ we are amazing hosts , ’ said @entity34 wryly			0
‘ and we are as frustrated as everyone watching			0
as bowlers we want our nicks to carry and for there to be a more even contest between bat and ball but i thought our attitude was fantastic			0
we could have moaned and groaned but we just got on with it			0
the pitch is what it is and we ca n’t do anything about it			0
’ prize wicket : @entity63 celebrates his dismissal of @entity13 danger man @entity182 for a solitary run @entity184 puts @entity13 in control at lunch , after @entity13 had moved serenely to 106 for one , @entity0 already seemed to be staring down the barrel but they pulled things back after the interval in an hour where @entity13 scored just 18 runs and lost two wickets			1
@entity34 , who had taken his 50th test wicket at @entity11 when @entity193 fell to a brilliant @entity45 catch , suddenly got the ball to reverse and @entity16 backed him up with imaginative field placings			2
@entity197 was equally well caught by @entity198 after @entity16 had placed him at silly mid on while @entity198 ’s safe hands were equally to the fore when @entity182 played at a @entity63 delivery he could have left alone and edged to slip			1
after that normal service was pretty much resumed with @entity0 ’s only other success coming when @entity87 toe - ended an attempted pull off @entity90 to @entity16 at silly point before @entity13 ’s captain @entity50 joined @entity38 in an unbroken partnership of 81 that saw @entity13 on top at the close			1
dangerous : no 3 @entity208 was threatening a big score before he was dismissed for 38 top take : it took an excellent catch from @entity198 ( centre ) off the bowling of @entity34 ( right ) to remove @entity197 @entity38 became watchful , notably while spending 48 balls in the 90s , while @entity50 was much more forthright , his strong wrists to the fore in his punchy strokes with minimal backlift			1
@entity0 need to separate the pair quickly on thursday			0
no real criticism could be aimed at the bowlers who , on the whole , let @entity16 down at @entity10 , with @entity63 in particular looking much more like his old self while conceding only 26 runs from his 19 overs			1
@entity16 is under considerable scrutiny so it should be said that tactically he was bright and imaginative , with his only flaw being his reluctance to plug the third man gap where more than 30 per cent of @entity13 ’s runs were scored			2
he can only hope that an expected change in the weather on day two might alter conditions for the bowlers			0
otherwise @entity0 could be in trouble .			0
