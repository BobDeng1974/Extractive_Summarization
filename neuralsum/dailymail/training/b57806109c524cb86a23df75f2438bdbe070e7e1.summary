by @entity0 tomorrow is only the beginning			1
at 3pm in the @entity3 i will introduce the @entity4			1
it will take 30 seconds , no more , but it will set in motion an important process			1
for this is truly a matter of life and death			1
the aim , in practical terms , is to change the way we treat patients , many of them terminally ill. the @entity4 's ultimate goal is to help find a cure for cancer			1
i confess to a personal interest			1
on december 17 , 2009 , my wife , the novelist @entity21 , was diagnosed with primary peritoneal cancer			1
it was at the hospital , at 5.32pm , that @entity21 was told the news			1
legacy : lord @entity0 with his wife @entity21 before she died last year from cancer she uttered three words			1
we did n't know then that it was terminal			1
and , as we discovered , there is precious little cause for optimism in the cancer ward			1
it is a place of fear and uncertainty and medieval treatments that are degrading and ineffective			1
i have witnessed scenes there that would not be permitted in a @entity51 horror movie			1
@entity21 died on june 2 , 2011			1
since then i have felt a gnawing , numbing , grief			1
@entity54 say this @entity55 with @entity21 or my love of @entity21 would be ridiculous			1
i would n't know about any of this if it were n't for her and what happened			1
but let me make clear : there is no real connection			1
i want to make a valid , worthwhile contribution , to put all that i have learnt to good use , and i realise that 's not necessarily helped by being the relative of the deceased			2
it 's worth remembering the people who have helped with the drafting of this @entity55 have no connection at all			2
my team has spent a year researching this and we 've consulted some of the top medical minds in the country			2
we also have their backing			2
the @entity55 itself has been drafted by one of the top parliamentary counsels , the person who is managing the legislative process is the former @entity83			2
their motive is not bereavement , it is to encourage people to find a cure for cancer			2
that 's exactly how i feel			2
i am a rational person confronted with a conundrum			2
which is , how is it possible that there 's been so much technological advance in so many spheres but not in cancer ? certainly not in the type of women 's cancers that @entity21 suffered			1
and i 've found one explanation			2
in @entity105 law there is only one test in cases of medical negligence			1
if a doctor is accused of failing to provide the proper care , a panel of expert witnesses is called to determine whether they would have acted in the same way			2
it stands to reason therefore that you are more likely to be found guilty of medical negligence if you depart from standard procedure			2
your livelihood and reputation are at risk if you deviate from the status quo			2
this , the , is a key barrier to progress			2
innovation is deviation by definition			2
this @entity55 will change the law in a very specific way by setting out a procedure that doctors can follow if they want to try a new and different treatment			1
according to professor @entity133 , chief executive at @entity134 , thanks to research into the cancer genome we are now on the brink of being able to provide much less toxic therapies			2
doctors know how to use them in a small subsection of a few cancers such as blood and lung cancers but they should be given more freedom to utilise them in an experimental setting			1
this @entity55 sets out the framework for that			0
how is it that we are still relying on chemotherapy , radiotherapy and invasive surgery when none of them guarantee a certain outcome ? worse , they often do more harm than good			0
most people think the terrible thing about cancer treatment is the hair loss			0
hair loss , particularly for a woman , is a terrible thing , but the side effects of the drugs are much more horrific than that			0
they create the same symptoms as the disease - nausea , diarrhoea , vomiting and fatigue			0
change : @entity175 peer lord @entity0 wants to amend the law to make it easier for doctors to try new treatments for cancer a further effect of the drugs is to damage the immune system , which opens a path to fatal infection			1
so a person is as likely to die from the treatment as from the cancer itself			0
with this @entity55 , doctors may try new methods , confident that they have a legal framework to work within			1
i realise there will be objections			0
nobody 's going to change the law without objections			1
firstly , i expect the government will say it 's otiose , a term much used in @entity202 , which means unnecessary			0
in other words this @entity55 will bring no benefit , they are already doing a marvellous job , tremendous new funds are being given to cancer research and people are working day and night on a cure			0
i do n't think that 's a serious objection because i do n't think anyone who has any experience of cancer would agree that everything 's going terribly well at all			0
the second objection is much more important , and it 's that this @entity55 is dangerous			0
it 's a license for recklessness and will allow quacks and snake oil merchants to practise experiments on patients and put lives at risk			0
in fact , the opposite is true			0
a correct process , set out in law , will deter illogical or unreasonable departure from standard practice			1
a great deal of our research has focused on finding that balance between innovation and recklessness			0
and we need that innovation			0
while the medical profession has made great inroads in some diseases , in others , such as pancreatic or ovarian cancer , there has been very little advance in rates of survival			0
according to the experts , the cure for cancer , like the discovery of penicillin or insulin , will come from a man or a woman who has an idea			0
and it is going to happen one day			0
but if it is to work they need to test that idea and prove that it 's true			0
this @entity55 is going to help encourage that person			0
so there is my motivation			0
true , my personal sorrow knows no bounds			0
conventional thinking tells us to ' move on ' after death			0
that would be a monstrous act of betrayal			0
@entity21 is me , i am her , we are one			1
death can not change that			1
my wife said poetry saved her life			1
its essential truths have rescued me too			0
in a poem by @entity283 , @entity284 , out , a boy 's arm is cut off in the sawmill			0
as he bleeds to death his workmates , ' since they were not the one dead , turned to their affairs			0
' @entity21 said that was the most brutal line in all of @entity105 literature			1
i will not be the one to turn away			0
if this @entity292 can help even one person , a mother , daughter , father , son , i will be happy			0
but ultimately , one day , i hope it will help find a cure			0
it will be a fitting legacy .			0

still suffers ' gnawing , numbing grief ' of losing his wife @entity21
set to introduce @entity4 on monday
will change the law so doctors are able to try new treatments
