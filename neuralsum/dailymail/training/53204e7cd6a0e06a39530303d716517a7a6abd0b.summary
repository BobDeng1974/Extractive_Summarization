he said his years in regional rep were vital in developing his talent and without that experience the current crop are unlikely to become great actors later in their career			1
treading the boards : @entity1 , pictured , said his apprentice in regional rep was crucial to the development of his acting powers theatre : @entity1 is not ' snooty ' about his film roles and is happy to be as famous for @entity30 as for the famous production of @entity32 , pictured with @entity33 above when asked if the current system could ‘ produce another @entity34 ’ he said : ‘ @entity36 , @entity6 or @entity7			1
i got better as an actor , and still i ’m getting better			1
that ’s only been possible because there ’s always been work			2
’ @entity42 star began his career at the @entity44 in @entity45 in the early 1960s where he trod the boards in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			2
now , he believes actors move too quickly into film and television			1
he told @entity53 : ‘ the situation is desperate			1
there are no [ resident ] companies in this country , not even the @entity59 has one			1
‘ the danger is going to be that the current generation of actors wo n't develop into good middle – aged performers because they wo n't have been able to live from their work			1
‘ the strength of @entity4 theatre should be that these actors in their middle years know what they 're doing and are good at it			2
not rich , not famous , but making a living			2
’ apprentice : @entity1 said without regional rep @entity4 will no longer produce actors of the calibre of @entity7 , pictured with @entity1 in production of @entity79 fame : @entity1 said he does not mind being as famous for his role as @entity82 , pictured left , as his critically acclaimed theatre roles , and even appeared as @entity85 in @entity86 , right he is not alone in his appreciation of regional rep - where a resident company perform a variety of plays , including classics and modern work			1
@entity7 has also previously spoken about the benefits of learning and making mistakes on the stage in the early part of her career			1
@entity6 is also reported to have been advised by @entity100 to take up regional rep. @entity1 added : ‘ why do you act ? you act for an audience			1
in the theatre , you 're in their presence			2
‘ film stars do n't know what it is to have an audience			0
‘ you see some at awards ceremonies who can hardly make it to the middle of the stage , they 're so nervous			0
there 's a microphone so they do n't have to project			0
and they read their words			0
‘ you see a theatre actor come on and it 's , “ oh , hold on , there 's a show happening ”			2
‘ @entity126 at the @entity127 – that 's a theatre man who happens to be a film star			0
’ calibre : @entity1 said that without repertory theatre @entity4 will no longer be able to produce acting greats such as @entity8 , pictured left , or @entity6 , right @entity1 found international stardom in the latter half his career , particularly with his roles in the blockbuster @entity30 trilogy and x-men trilogy			1
@entity1 said he is not ‘ snooty ’ about the parts he takes			0
he said : ‘ i 've always had very catholic tastes			0
@entity143 and @entity144 – men are both good storytelling			0
‘ they 're not franchises about cannibals or mindless outer space visitors			0
these are epic tales that do more than entertain			0
‘ millions and millions of people have seen @entity30			0
of course i 'm more famous for that than @entity32			0
just because a piece of work has been seen by so many more people does n't mean it 's less in value			0
‘ i 'd as soon see a pantomime as a revival of @entity47 ; it all depends if it 's any good			0
