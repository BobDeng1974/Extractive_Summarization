having been flushed with the success of seeing @entity2 reach the @entity4 final , a local bathroom maker has decided to commemorate the occasion with none other than ... a limited edition ' @entity8 '			2
rather than being a poor excuse for toilet humour , @entity9 has created a toilet seat featuring the club 's tiger stripes on one side - which could still cause some fans an upset stomach after owner @entity19 's derided attempts to rebrand the club			0
but , perhaps even more concerning , is the image of @entity22 that greets the user once the lid has been lifted , supposedly a tribute to the first manager to lead @entity2 to a @entity4 final			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity22 on @entity2 's @entity30 date toilet humour ! @entity9 's toilet seat features the @entity34 ' stripes and @entity22 under the lid ! however , should the @entity34 ' attempts to upset overwhelming favourites @entity37 fail when the two sides meet at @entity30 on saturday , the aim of any disgruntled supporters after the game can not be guaranteed			1
@entity22 's team talk will have been made easier after an image that appeared to show @entity37 's victory bus , emblazoned with the words ' @entity37 , the @entity4 @entity47 2014 ' was leaked - while traffic notices around north @entity48 suggest making way for a victory parade on sunday			2
not to be outdone , @entity2 have confirmed they would be staging their own celebrations , although at least the statement was less self assured : ' should our historic appearance in the @entity4 final next weekend result in @entity57 lifting the iconic trophy , a victory parade through the streets of @entity2 will take place on sunday 18 may			0
' the parade will start at the @entity63 and take in many areas of @entity2 including @entity65 , the city centre , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
' causing a stink ! @entity22 's reward for taking @entity2 to their first @entity4 final is his image in a toilet seat parade : a picture of a bus embossed with the @entity37 badge and strap - line ' @entity84 ' has emerged @entity9 , the @entity86 's leading bathroom manufacturer , employs around 300 people in @entity2 and has been making their products there since 1936			1
@entity89 , managing director , @entity9 @entity86 , said : ' we are very proud of our hometown football team , @entity2 and wanted to do something to mark their achievement and let them know everyone at @entity9 will be supporting them in the final			0
' this is certainly something a little bit fun and a little bit different , but because of our heritage and our innovative designers , we understand bathrooms better than anyone else and know that people want personalised solutions for their bathrooms at home			0
' let ’s just hope this @entity109 seat lid is n’t the only thing @entity22 will be lifting up this weekend – and we are certainly hoping that @entity2 win , rather than loos ! ' underdogs : @entity2 will have to overcome favourites @entity37 in the @entity4 final at @entity30			1

@entity2 will play @entity37 in the @entity4 final at @entity30 on saturday
to celebrate , @entity9 have produced a commemorative toilet seat
the seat features the @entity34 ' stripes on one side and manager @entity22 's image on the other
