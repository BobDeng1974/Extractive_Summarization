with 20 goals to his name this season , @entity1 captain @entity0 is regarded by many as the best striker outside the @entity7			1
in fact , @entity0 has been lighting up the @entity9 for the last three seasons , scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game			1
the next logical step for the @entity18 - born striker is the top flight and , with @entity1 just a point off the top of the table with five games to go , he could well be skippering the @entity24 in the @entity7 next season			1
@entity1 striker @entity0 won the @entity9 's @entity26 for march hornets skipper @entity0 is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading @entity1 to the @entity7 @entity0 believes he can follow in the path of @entity30 and @entity31 by becoming a @entity7 hit @entity1 are currently just one point behind @entity9 leaders @entity35 with five games left to play and @entity0 , who was this week named the @entity36 , makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level			1
he said : ' i 've looked at @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity41 and @entity42 before that			2
' these are all people that have been in the @entity9 , done well , then held their own in the @entity7			1
' there is a sign there that you can really go on ( from the @entity9 )			2
if you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals			2
' i want to make sure that when i go up there i 'm ready for it and i show what i 'm about			0
' it seems fair for @entity0 to say ' when ' and not ' if ' he plays at the top level because on this season 's evidence he and striker partner @entity57 certainly are ready for it			1
between them the championship 's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and @entity0 waxed lyrical about his @entity67 strike partner			1
' he 's a natural finisher , ' he said			0
' before saturday ( when @entity57 scored from 20 yards in the win over @entity71 ) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18 - yard box			1
' he 's definitely a poacher and when he scores he normally scores doubles , one game he got four			0
he scores in bunches which is a sign of a real good striker			2
' @entity0 is adamant that together he and @entity57 could terrorise @entity7 defences			1
' i 've been and watched a few games this season and i do n't see why not , ' he said			2
@entity1 striker @entity57 has also been in fine goalscoring form during the course of the campaign @entity0 has been impressed with @entity87 since the @entity1 manager took charge in october ' i think you have to be very ruthless in the @entity7 and we 've shown that we can score goals			1
' are we confident we can do it ? definitely			0
' @entity1 - currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference - joined the promotion - chasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss @entity87 took charge in october			1
but referring to that period @entity0 , who has played under seven managers since joining @entity1 from @entity105 in 2010 , insists : ' it was n't that bad			1
' he added : ' it definitely brought the players closer together			0
' it 's just one of those things really , in any line of work if your manager changes your job does n't change			0
' @entity1 have won 15 of @entity87 's 27 matches in charge and @entity0 has been impressed by the @entity119 's tactical flexibility			1
ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity121 , he said : ' we 've got a talented squad so we can go from 4 - 4 - 2 to 4 - 4 - 2 diamond to 3 - 5 - 2 or 4 - 3 - 3			2
' his ( @entity87 's ) adaptability would be the one thing that makes him stand out			0
' former @entity1 boss @entity127 handed @entity0 the captain 's armband during his brief spell in charge but @entity0 's role in the revival of @entity1 's season , not just as goalscorer but as captain , can not be underestimated			1
@entity127 made him captain before the start of the season and @entity0 seems to have taken to the role like a duck to water			2
' i was very vocal anyway , ' he said			0
' if i 've got something to say i 'm going to say it anyway , good or bad , and i think that once people know me they respect that			0
' if you 're doing good i 'll tell you you 're doing good , if you 're doing wrong i 'll tell you you 're doing wrong			0
i do n't expect anything else of others towards myself			0
' the added responsibility of now having to lead even more by example , i think that 's the only that 's changed			0
' but then i think i did it pretty well beforehand , i think that 's why they made me captain			0
they know what i 'm about and what i offer			0
' but now it 's a case of justifying why they have made that decision			0
' @entity0 served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release			1
@entity0 has warned his @entity1 team - mates they have ' three weeks of hard work ' ahead of them ' the two are definitely linked , ' he admits			1
' but it 's more down to personal growth and realising what an opportunity i had , instead of being an idiot and just letting my chance go by			0
' i 've just grasped it with both hands and become a better footballer and a better person for it , so it ( prison ) was probably a blessing in disguise			0
' captaining @entity1 in the @entity7 next season , @entity0 admits , would be the crowning glory after three years ' hard work following his release			1
' that would be the fairytale ending , ' said the 26 - year - old			2
' but we 've got three weeks of hard work before we can even start thinking about that , so i 'm just going to keep working and hopefully that fairytale can come true			0
' you get the feeling @entity0 will be playing in the @entity7 regardless of what happens in the next few weeks			1
but @entity1 have as good a chance as any of promotion with their talismanic captain in the side .			2
