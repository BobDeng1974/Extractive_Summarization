by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 02:04 est , 22 august 2013 @entity1 off to sleep at 2am as her tiny two - month - old son @entity3 lay beside her			2
with him snuggled between @entity1 and her husband @entity5 , the fledgling family seemed the picture of contentment			2
but a couple of hours later @entity1 awoke with a start and realised @entity3 was no longer by her side			2
her shock had turned to panic by the time she discovered him under the duvet at the bottom of her and @entity5 's marital bed			1
' he 'd either wriggled there or we had pushed him down in our sleep , ' says @entity1			2
' i get a cold sweat when i think about it			2
@entity3 could have been smothered			2
he was sound asleep and it was just a lucky coincidence i woke up			2
who knows what could have happened ? he could have died and become a statistic			2
' dangerous bonding : babies can be squashed or suffocated if they sleep in the same bed as their parents ( posed by models ) the statistic to which @entity1 refers is the number of babies who die of @entity39 ( @entity39 ) each year			1
they were given a disturbing new focus recently when researchers revealed that babies who share a bed with their mothers are up to five times more likely to die than those who sleep separately			1
@entity39 - the sudden and unexplained death of a child under the age of one - kills 300 babies a year in @entity51			1
it has been long known that premature babies and those with breathing and heart problems are more susceptible , while parents who smoke , take drugs or drink to excess are known to put their baby at risk			1
but it now transpires that even the most diligent mothers , like @entity1 , are also jeopardising their baby ’s safety by co-sleeping			1
' babies have been squashed or wriggled under the duvet and can die from being overheated ' the comprehensive review - compiled with data from five previous studies and after examining nearly 1,500 cases of @entity39 - revealed that an estimated 88 per cent of deaths that occurred while a child slept with their parents would not have happened if the baby had not been bed - sharing			1
' @entity78 , i suppose we knew it was risky , ' says @entity1 , 40			2
' it was n't a choice to co-sleep that night			0
we were just so tired			0
i was absolutely mortified and still am			0
' an adult bed can be a dangerous environment for a baby , as @entity87 , a senior lecturer in midwifery at @entity89 , explains : ' babies have been squashed or wriggled under the duvet and can die from being overheated			1
' yet 50 per cent of all mothers share a bed with their baby at some stage , despite @entity97 guidelines urging them to place an infant in its own cot for the first six months			1
risk : half of all mothers share a bed with their baby at some stage , despite @entity97 guidelines urging them to place an infant in its own cot for the first six months this is , perhaps , due to the popularity of trendy ' attachment parenting ' , as espoused by psychologists such as @entity112 and celebrity mothers from @entity114 to @entity115			1
it encourages mothers to feed their babies on demand and never let them out of their sight			1
the ' breastapo ' also has a case to answer : pressure on women to breastfeed has led to a huge rise in co-sleeping , with 80 per cent of mothers succumbing to it			1
because breast milk is easier to digest than formula , babies grow hungrier faster and need to be fed more often than their bottle - fed peers			1
many mothers feel the only way they can get any sleep at all is to keep their child by their side			1
@entity1 , an event manager , who lives with @entity5 , 42 , a chartered surveyor , and @entity3 , now seven , and @entity139 , four , in @entity140 , @entity141 , admits that 's what happened to her			0
' i was desperate to breastfeed and was advised by my parenting class to keep @entity3 on my breast non-stop to get feeding established , ' she says			1
' when i think of what could have happened i feel sick			0
i now fully appreciate how dangerous co-sleeping can be ' ' but he never got enough milk			1
i was feeding every two hours			0
i would never have slept			0
' @entity3 was given a bottle and his own cot in their room , but @entity1 is still haunted by the incident			1
' when i think of what could have happened i feel sick			0
i now fully appreciate how dangerous co-sleeping can be			1
' yet plenty of professional bodies still promote its benefits			0
@entity160 , senior policy advisor at the @entity161 , insists the organisation does not advise new parents on whether to sleep with their baby , but adds : ' we are aware of the advantages of bed sharing for a baby in terms of reassurance and establishing breastfeeding			1
' for parents it works very well because they get more sleep			0
historically and culturally babies have slept close to their parents			1
' certainly , until the advent of the cot in the 19th century , co-sleeping in western society was de rigueur			1
parenting expert @entity180 , author of @entity181 , insists that co-sleeping poses no added risk if planned properly			1
' it is the most common way of sleeping in @entity186 and they have the lowest sids rate in the world , ' she says , claiming that mothers instinctively form a protective ' frame ' around their baby with their body			1
but @entity180 admits there are caveats			0
babies should always be put in sleeping bags above , never under , parents ' duvets			1
three 's a crowd : sleeping with your baby can drive a wedge between couples they should sleep on their mother 's side of the bed , as research shows fathers are less attuned to their child 's movements and more likely to roll on top of them			1
and formula - fed babies - without the immunity - boosting properties of breast milk - should not co-sleep at all as studies have shown them to be at a higher risk of @entity39 in the first place			1
professor @entity222 , who runs the @entity223 at @entity224 , says she has also discovered that breastfeeding mothers instinctively position their babies more safely in their bed than those who have never breastfed			1
' mothers who have only bottle fed place their baby up near their face , rather than at their chest , so they are on the pillow and at risk of suffocation , ' she says			1
' your partner will start to feel left out if you have a little person with you 24 hours a day			0
there is never time to be a couple ' some co-sleep for the feeling of closeness as much as to facilitate breastfeeding			2
' the increased skin - on - skin contact releases a hormone called oxytocin that promotes bonding , ' says @entity180			0
@entity251 , 40 , a company director from @entity252 , co-slept with her daughter @entity253 , now three , after her birth in september 2009 until her son @entity255 , now 18 months , was born in february last year			2
now he still sleeps with @entity257 if teething or fretful			0
' it feels unnatural not to , ' says @entity251			0
' he wants to be close to me - why would i deprive him of that ? ' she says health visitors and midwives were already aware of the dangers at the time she gave birth			0
' it was rammed down my throat i should n't do it but i have always been mindful of safety and my natural instinct won over , ' she says			0
' it is wrong that mothers are made to feel guilty			2
' and what of the husbands in this arrangement ? co-sleeping inevitably creates an added barrier to spousal relations which are often already strained by a newborn			0
@entity251 admits that there were times when her husband @entity282 , 43 , a company manager , ' put his foot down '			2
' but at the end of the day it ’s not him getting up in the night , is it ? ' she claims co-sleeping has had little impact on their romantic life , however			0
' i sleep better this way so i 'm happier , which means i 'm a better mother and wife			0
' but maternity nurse @entity295 , author of @entity296 , is adamant co-sleeping has a ruinous effect on a relationship : ' your partner might enjoy it for the first few days but he will start to feel left out if you have a little person with you 24 hours a day			0
there is never time to be a couple			0
' attachment parenting advocates as much skin - on - skin contact as possible @entity309 could n't agree more			1
she and her husband @entity310 , a welder , agreed long before their son @entity311 was born in july 2009 and daughter @entity313 came along two years later that there was no place in their family for co-sleeping			0
' i adore my children but do n't want to spend every waking moment with them , ' she says			0
' our bedroom is the only place we can get away			0
there is barely enough room for two of us without a baby in the middle			0
' @entity311 and @entity313 both slept in a cot at the bottom of the bed before moving into their own rooms at four and eight months respectively			1
@entity309 , 33 , breastfed each for eight months and says that the safety implications of co-sleeping worried her almost as much as the invasion of her marital privacy			2
' i 'd go downstairs to feed so i did n't risk falling asleep on our bed , ' she says			2
' i was paranoid about suffocating them and no matter how tired i was i 'd never feed lying down			0
' @entity309 , a primary school teacher from @entity343 , was brought up by her own parents never to enter their room and is now training @entity311 and @entity313 to do the same			0
the upshot is that neither wakes in the night , she adds			0
' i have friends who have co-slept and their children are now six and still getting into their bed			2
at what point do you draw the line and say they need to sleep on their own ? ' it is a controversial question			0
but based on the latest scientific findings , it seems that sooner would be infinitely safer than later .			0

babies who share a bed with their mothers are up to five times more likely to suffer @entity39
@entity97 urge placing infant in own cot for first six months
many mothers share a bed due to popularity of ' attachment parenting '
others find it easier when breastfeeding
but it can also ruin relationships as well as being dangerous
