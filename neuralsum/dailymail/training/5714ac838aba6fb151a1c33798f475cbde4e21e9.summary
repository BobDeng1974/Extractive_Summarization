by @entity0 flaming hot : actress @entity2 who , like 650,000 of her fellow @entity3 , has red hair , a trait scientists claim could be threatened by climate change global warming could lead to the extinction of @entity3 's redheads , expects have claimed			1
experts believe that @entity3 ’s gloomy climate has led to a red hair emerging as a genetic adaptation to help exploit rare sunny days and boost @entity15 production			1
but as the world warms up , some predict that the change in climate will lead to more sunny days for the @entity3 - meaning they will no longer be so well adapted to their environment			1
only about 1 - 2 per cent of the world ’s population has red hair but in @entity3 the figure is much higher , with about 13 per cent , or 650,000 people , with flaming locks			1
@entity29 , managing director of genetic testing company @entity30 , said the country ’s dull weather was responsible for a larger number of flame - haired men and women being born			0
dr @entity29 told the @entity37 : ' we think red hair in @entity3 , @entity40 and the north of @entity42 is adaptation to the climate			1
we do not get enough sun and have to get all the vitamin d we can			0
' if it was to get less cloudy and there was more sun , there would be fewer people carrying the gene			0
' red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 , which causes a mutation			2
that means a person who does not have red hair can still produce red - haired children if they and their partner is a carrier of the gene			2
despite concerns that red hair dying out , many experts say it is likely to continue for many generations			2
research publised last year by @entity72 found that 20million people in the @entity74 and @entity40 have ginger genes			0
the most red - headed part of @entity74 and @entity40 is the @entity77 of @entity3 with @entity78 as a red - hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of the three common red hair gene variants			1
but the biggest surprise revealed by the research is just over 34 per cent of the population of parts of the north of @entity42 are carriers , making @entity88 and @entity89 as red - headed as @entity40			0
football boss @entity90 , another @entity91 : many experts say red hair is likely to continue for many generations the findings are ironic in the light of research by the @entity98 think tank which claimed that redheads suffer more discrimination per head of population than ethnic minorities			1
they conducted an experiment and found that ' a job applicant with ginger hair is seven times more likely to be rejected than a dark - haired applicant , and eight times more likely than a fair - haired applicant			0
' @entity114 , lecturer in psychology at the university of the @entity118 , and herself a redhead , said : ‘ red hair still gives out deep cultural signals			0
' women , for example , are wild and quick - tempered , while ginger - haired men are unattractive and geeky			0

experts believe @entity3 's gloomy climate is behind *emergence* of red hair
the adaptation helps redheads *absorb* more vitamin d on cloudy days
but as the world warms , more sun could mean the trait is not helpful
