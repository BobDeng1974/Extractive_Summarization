by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 08:19 est , 14 march 2014 @entity2 at @entity3 graves : the @entity5 man says teachers rely too much on poetry to educate children about horror of the war teachers rely too much on poetry to educate children about the realities of the @entity3 , @entity2 has said			1
after addressing a conference of teachers debating how to mark the centenary of the @entity3 , he said that the poems of @entity16 and @entity17 ' fail to answer the really interesting questions '			1
teachers have long used poems such as @entity17 's @entity20 to teach pupils about the suffering of soldiers in the trenches			1
but @entity2 said such an approach merely ' luxuriated in the horror ' of the conflict			1
after telling an audience that ' poetry is part of the problem of how we teach @entity3 ' , he lamented that the war was ' only ever taught as poetry now '			1
' all that is taught is about the pointless sacrifice , ' he told @entity37			0
' it 's not helpful to see the whole thing through the eyes of poetry			0
' such an introduction to the war could lead to people ' passing on half - baked prejudices ' , he went on , adding : ' the big question is why @entity17 , after writing his anti-war poetry , and @entity16 , after his letter of protest , decided to go back and fight			1
' ' luxuriating in the horror of the thing really wo n't do and does n't set out to answer the really interesting questions			1
' @entity2 had earlier told the conference in @entity55 , organised by @entity56 and @entity57 , that a lack of a sense of duty made another war like the @entity3 ' unimaginable ' now			1
he said he believed that modern life is all about the ' pursuit of personal pleasure ' , a concept that would have been alien to young people during the @entity3			0
' there was what is notably absent now - another thing that i think makes this sort of conflict unimaginable in the future - there was a sense of duty , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' if you consider the way we lead our lives now , we lead our lives essentially in an atomised fashion , pursuing personal pleasure			0
' it 's all about personal choice ; do what you want , please yourself			0
' this was a world that was unknown to young people in 1914 , 1915 , 1916			0
' poets : after addressing teachers debating how to mark the centenary of the @entity3 , he said that the poems of @entity16 , left , and @entity17 , right , ' fail to answer the really interesting questions ' @entity2 last week said that modern society is too ‘ self - obsessed ’ and ‘ hedonistic ’ to breed the kinds of soldiers needed for a conflict like the @entity3			1
speaking at a literature festival in @entity101 , he said the idea of ‘ duty ’ had now diminished in favour of ‘ personal freedom ’ , adding : ‘ what would [ the younger ] generation fight for ? the right to use your @entity109 ? what are the great noble causes ? ’ he added : ‘ ideas of duty , clearly strongly felt by many people , have diminished as the international significance of the country has diminished			2
‘ we live in such a relativistic society now , and materialist , self - obsessed and hedonistic ; it ’s hard to imagine circumstances under which people would say that “ it is worth it , i am willing to risk my life and well - being for this			1
” ’ mr @entity2 , 63 , said he had ‘ no doubt whatsoever ’ that the war would not be fought today but that in his opinion , ‘ some things are worth fighting for			1
’ social media generation : @entity2 also claimed recently that a conflict like the @entity3 would not happen today because society is too ' self - obsessed ' and ' hedonistic ' wednesday 's conference conference also heard from the novellist @entity136 , the author of @entity137 , who said he believed that all young people should visit not just @entity140 war graves but @entity142 ones too to ensure that they understand " where we come from "			1
the best - selling writer and former children 's laureate also suggested that children need to be told personal stories about historical events such as the @entity3 because these are often too big for them to comprehend			0
mr @entity136 said stories are able to get through to people in a way that history books are unable to do			0
he told delegates he wanted to inspire and alert young minds to what happened during the war because it was ' the critical moment of our times , it was the cusp of history '			2
' over the top ' during the @entity162			0
@entity2 believes nothing like this war would ever happen again because the young men and women of today have no motivation to fight or ' ideas of duty ' ' i think it should be , i wo n’t say obligatory , but the minister of education in me says obligatory , for every child to go there and stand there and look at those graves , but not just our graves , to go to the @entity142 graves where actually they do n’t go , ' he said			1
' because they were sons and fathers just as our boys were			0
so i think that ’s important because we are living in this world where we travel , we are @entity185 , we feel together with these people but it is important for us to know where we come from			0
' he also said that fiction and stories can teach people about different topics			0
' of course history has to be the basis of it , that ’s absolutely the case , but it is the case also that the records that are left behind , that is the diaries , the letters home , those voices which speak from the heart , from the front to those who are loved at home , or simply jotted down , or the poems that they wrote , they have a way of getting through to us as a history book might not be able to do			2
' speaking on how to educate pupils about the war , @entity136 said stories are able to get through to in a way that history books are unable to he added : ' what i ’ve tried to do all my writing life and all my teaching life is to bring stories to children			1
and i think the critical thing about making stories that work for children is that the children have to somehow feel the reality of the story			0
' mr @entity136 said that teachers can stand in front of pupils and tell them about a major moment in history - such as the atrocity of the @entity232			2
' it ’s all huge , it ’s all too massive to comprehend such suffering and anyway for them , it was then , so whilst they might write an essay about it and somehow you ’ve told them that story , you have n’t touched them , and you and i all know the way to touch them - they read @entity246			0
' they go there and they know it then , and they care about it because they care about one person			0
' in a written statement for the conference , organised by @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity255 said that children must be taught to understand the significance of the @entity3 and the debt owed to the generation who fought in it			2
the prime minister insisted that pupils must learn why war broke out , what it was like for those involved and how the conflict helped to shape modern society			1
and he suggested that schools should not ' shy away ' from teaching pupils about the realities of the conflict			1
he said that this year ’s centenary will be a ' hugely important national moment ' which will bring people together to reflect on the sacrifices made by many men and women			2
' i want to put children at the front and centre of those commemorations , so that they too understand the significance of the conflict and the debt we owe that generation			2
' the prime minister said pupils need to learn why war broke out , and how ' political alliances and rivalries ' could have such an impact on the lives of people around the world			2
he added : ' visiting the sites where it took place is a sobering reminder of those realities			0
' seeing the thousands of names that cover the memorials , the row upon row of headstones , brings to life the scale of the sacrifice			0
' as many people as possible should visit the battlefields , which is why the government is giving two pupils and one teacher from every state secondary school the chance to go to the @entity320 , mr @entity255 said .			0
