@entity1 @entity0 is speaking out against partisan politics in @entity3 - saying that the current @entity4 is n't ' equipped really to do anything '			1
@entity0 , who was the second woman ever appointed to the @entity1 , also talked about how she still experiences sexism in the chamber - and said she has no plans to retire anytime soon			1
while discussing @entity4 , @entity0 said she was confident the country would one day get the legislature it deserved			1
@entity1 @entity0 said in a recent interview that the current @entity12 - controlled @entity4 was n't ' equipped really to do anything ' ' the current @entity4 is not equipped really to do anything ... someday , we will go back to having the kind of legislature that we should , where members , whatever party they belong to , want to make the thing work and cooperate with each other to see that that will happen , ' she told @entity24			1
@entity0 's fighting words should come as no surprise			2
one of the loudest voices of dissent in conservative chief justice @entity30 ' court , she has hardly been shy when it comes to expressing her disapproval			0
but there was a period of time when she said she could n't make her point of view heard at all			0
' once it happened all the time that i would say something and there was no response and then a man would say the same thing and people would say " good idea , " ' she said			0
' that happens much less today			0
' and @entity0 , who has beaten two forms of cancer and said she does 20 push ups a day , also has no problem shooting down calls for her retirement based on concerns for her age and health			1
the eldest sitting justice on the court , @entity0 described her job as the ' best and hardest ' one she 's ever had - and she has no intention of letting it go just yet			1
' i will step down when i feel i can no longer do the job full steam , ' she said			1
@entity0 also discussed experiencing sexism in the chamber : ' once it happened all the time that i would say something and there was no response and then a man would say the same thing and people would say " good idea , " ' ‘ once i sense that i am slipping , i will step down ’ but @entity0 said she has only become more vocal about her opinions as she 's aged , saying that , when she was younger , she just accepted that there was nothing she could do about discrimination			1
but now @entity0 said she uses her opinions and speeches to try and teach ' how wrong it is to judge people on the basis of what they look like , the color of their skin , whether they 're men or women '			2
' my aspirations have not changed since the ' 70s , ' she said			0
' my hope for our society is that we 're going to use the talent of all of the people and not just half of them			0
' and when it comes to racism , @entity0 believes society still has a long way to go			0
' people who think you could wave a magic wand and the legacy of the past will be over are blind , ' she told @entity24			0
more recently , @entity0 made headlines after writing a scathing dissent against the @entity109 vs @entity111 case , which allowed corporations to use religious beliefs as a reason to not provide contraception in their health care plans			2
the justice was especially worried about how the ruling would affect women who now had to pay for their birth control out of pocket			0
she wrote : ' it bears note in this regard that the cost of an iud is nearly equivalent to a month 's full - time pay for workers earning the minimum wage			0
' @entity0 said she has only gotten more confident about voicing her opinions as she 's aged , saying that , when she was younger , she just accepted that there was nothing she could do about discrimination but @entity0 ( pictured here with the sitting @entity1 justices ) has become one of the loudest voices of dissent in chief justice @entity30 ' ( center of bottom row ) court @entity0 voiced similar concerns when discussing how state - enforced abortion laws were especially hurting low - income women			1
although @entity0 was confident that ' women of means ' will always have access to safe abortions , she said current state restrictions were operating ' against the woman who does n't have the freedom to move , to go where she is able to get safely what she wants '			2
even as she was happy to voice her opinions on race and women 's rights , @entity0 was careful to keep silent about same - sex marriage , which the court will rule on this year			1
' i do n't want to suggest how the court will decide that case , one way or another , ' she told @entity24			0
@entity0 , who is the first @entity1 to officiate a same - sex wedding and recently said nationwide marriage equality would not require ' a large adjustment ' from @entity166 , has already come under fire from groups			2
the @entity170 demanded that @entity0 disqualify herself from the upcoming hearings because she had made it ' crystal clear that she is going to rule in favor of redefining marriage when these cases come before her , ' a spokesman said			0
despite calls to retire so @entity177 can select her successor , @entity0 said she has no plans to quit and that she will step down when ' i feel i can no longer do the job full steam '			1

@entity0 said one day members of @entity4 will once again ' want to make things work and cooperate ' - despite their party *loyalties*
said she used to experience sexism in the court and that people would only listen to her ideas after a man *repeated* them
but the *81* - year - old says she has gotten more confident about voicing her opinions with age
has no plans to retire and will continue until she ca n't do the job ' full steam '
