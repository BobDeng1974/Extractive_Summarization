television fans now face paying bills of more than £ 100 if they want access to live sport and the latest hit shows			0
the rise of production costs and increasing competition between web - streaming services mean many pay for multiple television packages bundled with their broadband and phone lines			1
on - demand services like @entity14 offer viewers more choice than ever before as well as exclusive programming - but at a hefty price			1
watching popular shows like @entity21 , @entity19 is the @entity22 and former @entity25 drama @entity23 as well as every @entity27 match would require a subscription to @entity29 , @entity14 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
rising cost : to watch hit shows like @entity35 , left , and @entity19 is the @entity22 , right , viewers would need a subscription to @entity31 and @entity14 respectively the @entity37 reported that if those services are bought directly , it would cost around £ 792 a year or £ 839 in hd - on top of a £ 145.50 tv licence			1
