by @entity0 a tiny baby has a new chance at life after she was given open heart surgery minutes after being born			1
@entity5 , now five weeks old , developed a rare heart condition in the womb , and doctors said she was unlikely to survive			2
surgeons were able to put a stent into the young girl 's heart , which gave her enough time to make it through to a second procedure just a week later , making her the youngest patient to undergo the surgery			1
survivor : @entity5 was given heart surgery minutes after birth , and a further procedure one week later			1
she is pictured recovering from the later operation fighters : @entity23 and @entity24 ( pictured with @entity25 ) decided to go through with the birth despite the low chances of survival after they felt her kicking her mother @entity23 , 24 , was told 20 weeks into her pregnancy that her daughter had developed hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a condition where only one side of the heart can beat properly			1
doctors even took the step of recommending that she terminate the pregnancy - since @entity25 was so unlikely to survive - but @entity23 and her husband @entity42 were determined to see it through once they felt @entity25 kicking in the womb			1
mrs @entity5 told the @entity45 : ' @entity25 has proved she is determined to live			0
iâ € ™ m so proud of her			0
the doctors say one in three million babies are at risk of the same condition			0
' we were told @entity25 could have operations but would only have a 50/50 chance of surviving the first and would need two more ... when you hear that you wonder if you should bring a child into the world			0
' stronger : @entity25 , pictured in the past week , has recovered well from the procedures - though there is more to come mr and mrs @entity5 were told they could either terminate the pregnancy immediately , give birth naturally and let @entity25 die in their arms shortly after birth , or persevere with the surgery - which they chose to do			2
mrs @entity5 gave birth to @entity25 , who weighed 7lbs , by caesarian at @entity71 in @entity72 , and could not even hold her before she was rushed off to surgery			2
@entity25 remains in intensive care in the hospital , but has been introduced to her two brothers : @entity77 , four , and @entity78 , 22 months			0
she has more procedures to come , but has so far gone from strength to strength .			0

the child , now five weeks old , was rushed off to surgery minutes after birth
