she is famed for her flawless complexion and at the age of forty she does n't have a wrinkle in sight			0
and while @entity5 has n't succumbed to any plastic surgery like many of her tinsel town friends , she is not averse to using products and treatments and has lately admitted to using @entity11 - dubbed ' the ironing treatment ' - to keep her wrinkles at bay			1
the a-list actress said : ' i do n't mind a few wrinkles and freckles			0
i had this laser treatment recently , @entity11 , and it took a couple of years off my face but i have n't had any plastic surgery yet			1
' beating the wrinkles : @entity5 has admitted to having a laser treatment called @entity11 that helps beat her wrinkles the cosmetic treatment , that is also favoured by the likes of @entity30 and @entity31 , helps tighten and smooth the top layer of the skin by plumping up the lower layers			1
the aim of @entity11 is to boost the levels of the collagen in the lower layers of the skin to create a tightening effect			1
however , unlike lasers and tools such as the @entity43 ( a roller with lots of little needles on it ) , @entity11 aims only to ' damage ' the lower levels of the skin , and not the top level , which it does by using radio waves that trigger the collagen production			1
dr @entity54 is reportedly @entity30 's preferred doctor to use for the treatment			2
her @entity57 clinic has been using @entity11 for more than five years , treating more patients than anyone in @entity60			2
dr @entity54 said : ' @entity11 is a radiofrequency skin tightening treatment that heats the deepest layers of your skin to help tighten existing collagen and stimulate the body ’s natural renewal of collagen			1
fellow fans : @entity30 and @entity70 are also reportedly fans of the non-invasive treatment ' it ’s perfect for targeting wrinkles and fine lines around the mouth , eyes or forehead , and further on in the ageing process @entity11 is great for decreasing hooding in the eye area , tightening loose jowls and creating definition in the jawline , as well as firming up sagging skin under the chin			1
' this creates subtle , natural looking results like smoother , tighter skin , softened wrinkles and lines and an overall younger looking appearance , without having to go under the knife			2
' but it does n't come cheap			0
patients who want their face treated have three options - full face ( £ 3,900 ) , half face ( £ 2,900 ) , or just eyes ( £ 1,900 )			0
craze : could @entity11 be the new , less intrusive answer to @entity101 ? @entity5 says she has @entity11 but no plastic surgery as of yet but the process , which works in a similar way to a microwave oven , has some worrying potential side effects from facial burns to scarring			2
dr @entity54 said : ' most people will see optimum results after about six months , but some people , who have poor circulation , and those with very sun - damaged skin , can have a slower response , so a top - up treatment can help			0
' people say it hurts , but to me it just tingled and felt a bit like i 'd had sunburn			0
it 's given me the results of a facelift without having to go under the knife , ' she added			0
@entity30 and @entity5 are certainly convinced , and they 're not alone			0
another @entity11 fan is supermodel @entity70 , who said : ' for me , it 's for enhancement , like hair colour or make - up			1

@entity11 boosts levels of the collagen in lower layers of the skin
creates a tightening effect much like the skin has been ironed flat
@entity30 also a fan
costs up to £ *4,000*
