by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:44 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 14:32 est , 28 february 2013 man with no shame : sir @entity4 will meet senior directors from the @entity6 @entity6 hospitals last night stood accused of fiddling figures to mask the numbers of patients dying needlessly			1
the boss of one trust has been forced aside and experts called in to investigate a possible cover - up over death rates			0
and professor @entity16 , a renowned specialist on hospital performance , believes several other hospitals may be doing the same			0
the revelations came as the chief executive of the @entity6 , sir @entity4 , prepared to meet senior bosses from the new body in charge of hospitals and health services for the first time since the @entity28 scandal report			1
the @entity29 – the focus of the latest allegations – had had one of the highest mortality rates in the country			1
but in 2011 , the figures suddenly dropped by 10 per cent and the trust was named as one of only about 50 in the country with ‘ lower than expected ’ death rates			0
the fall was initially celebrated as evidence of improving performance but there are now concerns it was merely a statistical trick			0
in fact , it is feared that since 2001 , an estimated 2,000 - plus patients may have died unnecessarily at the trust			1
yesterday it emerged that dr @entity49 , the chief executive , has ‘ stepped aside ’ while a joint investigation is carried out by mortality experts and the local @entity6 body			2
the @entity6 ’s medical director , professor @entity53 , said : ‘ it is absolutely unacceptable for any part of the @entity6 to deliberately manipulate any patient information			0
‘ if we ’re to have an open and accountable @entity6 , where patients and the public know how @entity6 hospitals are doing , those hospitals must behave openly and honestly about their performance			2
’ yesterday the @entity63 heard claims that previous official reports into @entity6 care had been suppressed because they revealed a ‘ pervasive culture of fear ’			0
this came as the chairman of the inquiry into the @entity28 scandal called for an immediate ‘ culture change ’ in the @entity6			1
the probe at @entity29 will consider whether staff categorised patients as dying from septicaemia – blood poisoning – when they actually died of more easily - treatable @entity80 rates are meant to reflect the standard of care in a hospital			1
as such , deaths from serious illnesses such as septicaemia and cancer do not influence figures as much as preventable deaths from hip fractures and infections			0
scandal : professor @entity16 ( left ) believes that within the last five years other hospitals have lowered their mortality rates by wrongly labelling deaths			1
dr @entity49 ( right ) who has stepped aside there is concern that preventable deaths from hip fractures or urine infections were intentionally labelled as septicaemia to lower the mortality rate			0
over the last year there have been 800 cases of septicaemia when there should only have been 200 in a trust this size			0
professor @entity16 believes that within the last five years other hospitals have lowered their mortality rates by wrongly labelling deaths			1
they include @entity111 in @entity112 and @entity113 , @entity28 and @entity114 in the @entity115 where mortality rates have been slashed by up to quarter in a single year			1
investigation : the probe at @entity29 will consider whether staff categorised patients as dying from blood poisoning when they actually died of more easily treatable conditions he said : ‘ i ca n’t prove it because the hospitals are denying it			2
they keep saying it ’s a coincidence			0
’ but he added : ‘ the whole thing is appalling			0
’ the investigation at @entity29 will go back through the records of 200 patients who died from septicaemia or were diagnosed with the condition			2
but experts have already looked into 50 cases and say there is ‘ sufficient cause for concern			0
’ today , for the first time since the @entity28 report , sir @entity4 will meet senior directors from the @entity6 – the new body in charge of hospitals and health services			1
relatives of patients who died at @entity28 will stage a silent protest outside the meeting in @entity149 to reinforce pressure on him to resign			1
a spokesman for @entity29 said : ‘ we do not believe there are any clinical concerns regarding the care of patients , but rather there are questions that need answering about how the trust reports information about their care for administrative and financial purposes			2

sir @entity4 will meet directors from the @entity6
relatives of patients who died at @entity28 will stage a silent protest
the @entity29 had one of the highest mortality rates
it is feared more than 2,000 patients may have died unnecessarily at the trust since 2001
