trainer @entity0 was on sunday praying the ground at @entity2 dries out further for @entity3 , who will attempt to give @entity4 a glorious send off in @entity5 with a second victory in @entity8 's @entity7			1
the 19 - time champion won the 2007 running on @entity10 and success aboard @entity12 would be a fairytale start to what could be @entity4 ’s final week as a jockey			2
he has vowed to immediately retire if he wins saturday ’s @entity16 ’s @entity7 at @entity17 on favourite @entity18 , the gelding which won last year ’s @entity20 under @entity21			0
@entity4 will attempt to win the @entity7 on @entity22 in his final race meeting in @entity5 that @entity3 disputes favouritism for monday 's race is largely due to the presence of @entity4 on his back			1
the champion jockey could have ridden @entity29 or if in doubt , who both also carry the colours of his boss @entity33			1
@entity3 ’s form this season is not inspiring but he finished a creditable eighth in last year ’s race when asked to carry top weight – only three of the last 20 winners have carried more than 11st - and @entity0 has identified a reason why the 10 - year - old pulled up quickly at @entity43 on his latest run			1
the trainer said : ‘ he choked at @entity43 when he looked to be about to run a decent race on slightly better ground which would have helped			0
we have never had a breathing problem before with him			0
@entity3 disputes favouritism for monday 's race largely due to the presence of @entity4 on his back ‘ he has worked well with tongue tie twice since with @entity53 on board			1
i hope it dries up a bit , it is soft to heavy which would n’t help			2
‘ he ran blinder last year and it is an almost impossible race to win off top weight			0
’ @entity4 had a double at the track on sunday , which included a typically determined success on @entity65 - trained @entity64 in the grade one @entity66 , which looked unlikely jumping the second last			2
@entity68 ( @entity69 ) gave trainer @entity70 a first grade one win of his career in the @entity74			0
@entity4 is helped to lift the @entity66 trophy by @entity76 at @entity2 on sunday			0

@entity4 will ride @entity3 in the @entity7 on monday
@entity3 disputes favouritism largely due to @entity4 's choice to ride him
he could *'ve* ridden @entity29 or if in doubt , also owned by @entity33
trainer @entity0 said of the track : ' i hope it dries up a bit '
