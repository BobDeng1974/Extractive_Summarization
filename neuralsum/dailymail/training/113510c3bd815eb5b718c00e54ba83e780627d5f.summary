@entity1 senator @entity0 singled out @entity3 founder @entity2 on wednesday for taking jobs away from @entity6 workers and giving them to immigrants to drive down his company 's costs			1
sessions , a @entity11 who is known for his fierce opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants , railed on the @entity17 floor against @entity2 and other @entity18 backing executive action by the president and legislation authored by the @entity22 that would increase the number of guest worker permits			1
' the “ @entity36 ” are very fond of open borders as long as these open borders do n’t extend to their gated compounds and fenced - off estates , ' he claimed at one point , according to @entity32 , which reprinted a version of his speech			0
the @entity11 senator targeted @entity2 because he is the founder of a @entity60 based non-profit organization that lobbies the government to make reforms to the immigration system			1
the goals of @entity65 include getting the government to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who currently reside in the @entity6 and to allowing skilled workers to jump to the front of the immigration line			2
reports that the president could grant work permits to up to six million illegal immigrants this fall has sessions especially riled up about the influence that special interests could have on the @entity81 's decision			0
' the administration is meeting with the elite , the cosmopolitan set , who scorn and mock the concerns of everyday @entity6 who are concerned about their schools , jobs , wages , communities , and hospitals , ' @entity0 said			1
' these great and powerful citizens of the world do n’t care much about old - fashioned things like national boundaries , national sovereignty , and immigration control — let alone the constitutional separation of powers			0
' in his rant against @entity2 and his allies , @entity0 claimed they were pushing the @entity81 to issues executive orders that admit foreign workers to the @entity6 ' for the explicit purpose of taking jobs in the @entity6			1
' ' many of us have heard for a long time the claim that there is a shortage of @entity113 [ science , technology , energy and math ] and it workers , ' @entity0 said			2
' this has been the central sales pitch used by those making demands for massive increases in foreign - worker programs across the board — programs that bring in workers for every sector in the @entity6 economy			1
' but we know from the nation ’s leading academics , people who studied this issue and are professionals in it , ' he said			1
@entity2 is pictured here at the @entity136 at @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 last friday			2
@entity2 is the founder of @entity65 , an organization that lobbies the government on immigration reform , among other issues sessions proceeded to read from a july op - ed published in @entity147 in which five professors of public policy from five universities assert that they 've been unable ' to find any credible evidence ' that there 's a shortage of workers in those fields			1
' imagine , then , how many more @entity6 would be frozen out of the middle class if politicians and tech moguls succeeded in doubling or tripling the flow of guest workers into @entity113 occupations , ' the op - ed states			2
sessions offered up the op - ed as proof that tech companies like @entity3 and @entity166 are using the h - 1b visa program ' to keep wages down and to hire less expensive workers from abroad			2
' ' indeed , the same companies demanding more guest workers are laying off @entity6 workers in droves , ' he said , referring to @entity166 's decision to lay off 18,000 workers			1
' so i would pose a question to mr. @entity2			0
i read in the news that @entity3 is now worth more than $ 200 billion			0
is that not enough money to hire @entity6 workers for a change ? ' he said a few minutes later			1
' let me just say one more thing : @entity3 has 7,000 workers			2
why does n’t mr. @entity2 call his friend mr. @entity185 and say : look , i have to hire a few hundred people ; do you have any résumés you can send over here ? maybe i will not have to take somebody from a foreign country for a job an unemployed @entity6 citizen might take			1
' @entity185 is also a founder @entity65			0
sessions pointed out that several other large technology companies , including @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , have also had massive lay - offs in the last two years			0
' there is no shortage of workers , ' he concluded			0
the president , he said , has already acted unilaterally to expand the work visa program this year by 100,000 more people			0
meanwhile , real median hourly wages have declined by 3.4 percent since 2009			0
' so what about the good , decent , and patriotic citizens of our country who fight our wars , who obey our laws , who follow our rules , and want a better future for their children ? should their needs not come first ? ' sessions asked			0
' we can not put the parochial demands of a few powerful @entity225 ahead of an entire nation ’s hopes , dreams , and aspirations , ' he added			1
' the job of elected officials is to answer to the people who sent them to @entity234 — not to scorn them , not to demean them , not to mock them , and not to sell their jobs and dreams to the highest bidder			1
' the @entity17 has already passed the @entity81 approved @entity22 legislation , proposed by four @entity11 and four @entity18			1
that legislation stalled in the @entity81 more than a year ago			0
the @entity81 has since passed legislation that would bar president @entity241 from using executive orders to give amnesty to illegal immigrants but @entity17 majority leader @entity245 has refused to bring the legislation to the floor in the upper chamber			2
on wednesday sessions encouraged his fellow senators to ' stand up ' to @entity245 and the president , ' this body is not run by one man			0
we do n’t have a dictator in the great @entity17			0
every member has a vote , ' he said .			0
