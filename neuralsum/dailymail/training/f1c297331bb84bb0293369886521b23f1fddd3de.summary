new research from the @entity1 shows that since the beginning of the 21st century , temperatures in the snow covered land of @entity6 are actually getting colder - bucking the overall global warming trend			1
in the @entity9 , where temperatures can get as cold as 50 degrees below zero , local residents have experienced the increasing chill and scientists now confirm that the @entity14 state is indeed seeing a temperature drop			1
a new report from the research center at the @entity18 reveals that the 49th state of the union has cooled by 2.4 degrees fahrenheit since 2000			1
colder : since 1977 , the mean annual temperature has been steadily rising but starting in the early 2000s that has been falling data : scientists reviewed weather reports from 20 climate stations operated by @entity27 across the state to determine that it is in fact getting colder in the @entity9 the drop is described as a ' large value for a decade , ' in the academic paper ' @entity34 of the @entity35 : a @entity36 of @entity6			1
' scientists based their research on temperature readings from weather stations operated by the @entity41			1
these stations are scattered across the state and represent the different climatic zones present			0
based on the readings , 19 of the 20 stations have measured a consistently cooler climate over time			1
the region most impacted by chillier temps is @entity6 , notably @entity50 on the @entity51			2
that region saw temperatures drop most sharply by 4.5 degrees for the decade			2
amazing cold : an average of 40 inches to 100 inches of snow fall in @entity6 each year			2
this man struggles to get out of his home in @entity60 , @entity6 after a massive storm in jan 2012 ice everywhere : scientists say that temperatures in the @entity14 state have fallen over the past decade in @entity6 ( pictured : an ice covered home in jan. 2012 in the fishing town of @entity60 , @entity6 ) in the paper , researchers credit an ocean phenomenon , called the @entity71 , with bringing colder surface water temperatures and thus beginning the overall cooling effect			1
this oscillation has brought a weakening of the @entity76 , the breeding ground for storms that end up regulating weather systems in the rest of the 48 states			2
with a less active @entity76 , cold winter storms have been sticking around @entity6 longer and keeping the temperatures chilly			1
this climate shift could shed new light on the long feared impact of dangerous greenhouse gases causing a rise in the average temperature of @entity91 's atmosphere and the thawing of arctic glaciers and sea ice			0
before the 2000s , the warming trend in @entity6 has actually been twice the overall warming rate			0
the sudden temperature increase began in 1977 and has gone up ever since 1998			0
but now the trend has been reversed , with the mean temperature dropping			0
@entity102 , a @entity41 forecaster , said local residents have noticed the colder temps but joked that when you 're ' already bundled up for 20 - below ' a few degrees colder does n't have as much of an impact , he told the @entity107			1
mr @entity102 also pointed out that for the first time in 2011 , due to the colder weather , the @entity109 ice shelf extended nearly to the edge of the @entity51			0
though the chill has hit most areas of the state , there is one exception			0
the @entity118 of the state , in the town of @entity120 , has actually seen temperatures rise since the region is secluded by the @entity123			0
the mountain range originates on the far northwest end of the state and stretches 700 miles into @entity127 's @entity126			0
in @entity120 , temperatures were actually 3.1 degrees higher .			0

since 2000 , temperatures in @entity6 have dropped by 2.4 degrees @entity131
scientists reviewed weather reports from 20 climate stations operated by the @entity41 located across @entity6
19 of the 20 weather stations reported falling temperatures
an ocean phenomenon has *disrupted* a storm regulating system thus *allowing* cold winter storms to linger longer and bring a deep chill
local residents have noticed the colder temps but say its no big deal since they are already bundled up for 20 - below zero temperatures
