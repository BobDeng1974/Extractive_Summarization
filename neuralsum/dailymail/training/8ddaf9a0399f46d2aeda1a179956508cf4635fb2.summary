@entity1 governor @entity0 warned that heavily indebted households will be ‘ particularly sensitive ’ to higher interest rates mortgage lenders ‘ filled their boots ’ by approving scores of applications without making thorough checks just before tougher rules came in , the financial watchdog said			1
one in five loans was passed without verifying borrowers ’ salaries prior to the introduction of the @entity16 , which banned the practice			1
the figures came out as @entity1 governor @entity0 warned that heavily indebted households will be ‘ particularly sensitive ’ to higher interest rates			1
in a speech at a conference in @entity21 yesterday he said record low interest rates posed threats to the economy and ‘ the biggest risks are associated with the housing market ’			1
according to the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) between april and june this year , there were 50,000 mortgage sales when banks and building societies did not check buyers earned what they said they did			0
this was despite the practice being outlawed on april 26 , suggesting many applications were rushed through in the weeks beforehand			0
these mortgages accounted for 20 per cent of all sales , a 4 per cent increase on the previous quarter			0
@entity40 , mortgage policy manager at the @entity28 , said that ‘ just ahead of the @entity16 coming into force we saw an increase in the number of mortgages where income was n’t verified ’			2
‘ it looks as if there was a bit of filling of the boots going on before everything was switched off ’ , she added during a speech at the @entity49 , in @entity50 , yesterday			2
fast - track mortgages – when loans are granted without requiring proof of income – have since been banned under the @entity16			0
lenders must now verify all borrowers ’ income – which is normally done by checking several pay slips or , for the self - employed , looking at their company accounts			1
@entity65 , a director at mortgage broker @entity66 , said : ‘ it is inevitable lenders would try to push things through before the regulation came into force			0
’ one in five loans was passed without verifying borrowers ’ salaries prior to the introduction of the @entity16 , which banned the practice interest rates have been frozen at 0.5 per cent since march 2009 – slashing the cost of mortgages for millions and making it easier to get on the housing ladder			1
but mr @entity0 said the first rate rise since 2007 ‘ is getting closer ’			2
‘ the economic outlook is much improved , ’ he said			2
‘ while there is always uncertainty about the future , you can expect interest rates to begin to increase			1
’ the @entity89 stressed that any increases ‘ are likely to be gradual and limited ’ and to a level ‘ materially lower than in the past ’ when they averaged around 5 per cent			2
he said such a cautious approach was required in part because of high levels of household debt – much of it tied up in property			0
household debt soared from 100 per cent of household income in 1998 to 163 per cent in 2008 before the housing market crashed			0
it has since fallen below 140 per cent			0
two members of the nine - strong committee that sets interest rates at the @entity1 have urged an immediate rise to 0.75 per cent			1
analysts expect rates to rise late this year or in the first half of next year – although it is feared rapid rises could derail the recovery if households cut back on spending to meet mortgage repayments .			0
