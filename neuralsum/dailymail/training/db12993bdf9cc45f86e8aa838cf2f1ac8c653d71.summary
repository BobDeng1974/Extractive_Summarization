now these satellite maps show just how far we ’ve fallen from the march 2012 high of @entity17 recorded in @entity18 , @entity19 , to a daytime low of -7.8c in the same village on monday of last week			1

‘ the direction of the wind therefore plays a major part in what type of weather you and i will see , especially as we have the @entity71 to our west and continental @entity58 to our south and east			0

@entity103 forecaster @entity102 said : ‘ it 's a real north - south split today			0
over high ground up to 10cms ( 3.9in ) could have fallen over night , with the potential for the same amount again today			1

it 's very cold for mid-march when we should expect much higher temperatures ' @entity103 forecaster @entity102 more snow is expected on friday			0
he added that the cold weather and snow storms across the north were likely to linger throughout the week and could even lead to blizzard conditions in @entity87			0
it continues a cold month across the @entity0 which has brought an unwelcome delay to spring weather			0
mr @entity102 said that while snow is not uncommon for march , the continued cold weather is			2
