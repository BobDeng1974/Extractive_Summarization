was this the finest season in the history of @entity4 golf ? when you think of names like @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , it would be quite a statement			1
not to mention recent examples , such as 2012 when @entity15 was winning the @entity17 @entity16 and we had the miracle of @entity20			1
but , by way of a farewell column for this marvellous year , let ’s make the case			2
in the spirit of @entity26 , let ’s recall 12 days that add to a wondrous argument for thinking it just so			0
day one : @entity32 , @entity33 it was all a bit quiet until mid-may			1
thankfully , @entity37 @entity36 thought it too quiet			1
with a gutsy 30ft putt for par on the island - green 17th he secured a one - stroke win in the @entity44 ’s flagship event and ignited a stunning run of success			1
day two : @entity47 , @entity48 the week began with @entity49 revealing his split from fiancee @entity51			1
@entity53 , we thought : what next ? thankfully , the answer was @entity56			0
seven shots back with a round left , @entity49 made up the deficit with a 66 for his first win on @entity4 soil			1
@entity36 holds the trophy after winning @entity32 at @entity33 day three : @entity63 , @entity64 the best 72 - hole performance in 2014 ? there ’s no argument			1
it ’s that man @entity36			1
after two rounds , he was the first man in major history to follow one 65 with another			0
no one got near him over the weekend , either			0
day four : @entity73 , @entity74 if you had to compile a list of players you would least like chasing you down the stretch , @entity75 would be near the top			0
@entity81 must have thought eight shots was enough insurance but @entity84 chased him down to complete a thrilling title defence			0
@entity36 celebrates winning the @entity63 with fellow @entity37 @entity86 at @entity64 day five : @entity87 , @entity88 he had already won once in july , in @entity17			1
now @entity90 crossed the @entity91 and delivered a links masterclass			0
four rounds in the sixties and a total of 16 under par on a course as forbidding as this one was a majestic effort			0
day six : @entity101 , @entity102 so much for @entity49 not being able to play links golf			2
like all the greats , he went away and worked hard on what was missing			0
his reward was two 66s to begin , a couple of eagles at the tail end of his next round , and a two - shot win on the final day			2
he became the first @entity4 to win three of the four majors			1
@entity49 announced his split from fiancee @entity51 ( right ) in may this year day seven : @entity114 , @entity115 who would have blamed him if he had rested on his laurels after his @entity63 win ? @entity49 , however , was a man on a mission			1
next stop , one of his favourite courses , as he caught @entity123 to claim his first @entity125 event			0
he was world no 1 once more			0
day eight : @entity127 , @entity128 over the previous eight rounds we had seen the power and glory of @entity15 ; now we saw the guts			0
after a long weather suspension he was three behind @entity135 and @entity136 and two off @entity138 with nine to go			0
yet he passed them all in the dying @entity141 light to seal his second @entity142 in a row			0
@entity49 won the @entity47 at @entity48 just days after splitting with @entity51 day nine : @entity144 friday , @entity145 it ’s never easy being heavy favourites , nor shifting momentum after losing the opening series			1
but @entity4 ’s golfers overcame both to turn a one - point deficit at lunch into a two - point advantage			2
the @entity17 had targeted @entity49 and @entity154 , only for @entity155 and @entity136 to demonstrate this was a team of many talents			1
day 10 : @entity144 saturday the @entity17 came back strong on the second morning , only to run into @entity158 and @entity75 at their most obdurate			1
alongside brilliant rookie partners @entity160 and @entity161 , they ensured there would be no @entity17 comeback			2
@entity154 helped @entity4 secure a memorable victory over @entity17 in @entity144 day 11 : @entity144 sunday a good start by the @entity17 and suddenly there were some frayed nerves			1
but @entity84 settled those by fighting back from three down against @entity168 to win the opening singles			2
with @entity171 , it was @entity160 who clinched the winning point with a wedge shot of a lifetime to 12 inches			0
day 12 : @entity176 , @entity177 it was fitting the final event came down to a shootout between four of @entity4 ’s stars			2
appropriate too , that the shot that separated @entity136 from @entity49 , @entity155 and @entity161 , to the par - three 17th , was one of the best played all year			2
@entity49 holds the @entity183 after his two - stroke victory at @entity102 in july quote of the year ' you could argue that @entity15 ’s run in the summer was the best three - week stretch of golf ever played			1
' @entity17 @entity135 offers his take on @entity49 ’s 12 rounds from mid-july to mid-august that earned him two majors and a @entity125			1
in sequence : 66 , 66 , 68 , 71 , 69 , 64 , 66 , 66 , 66 , 67 , 67 , 68			0
it was n’t just on the men ’s circuit that @entity4 ’s leading players dominated			2
thanks to @entity199 with his two senior majors and a brilliant year for the ageless @entity12 , they cleaned up among the over- 50s as well			0
meanwhile , at the @entity205 this week , @entity204 ’s @entity203 , at the age of just 18 , is in pole position to become the youngest winner of the @entity208 .			0

@entity37 @entity36 ignited stunning run of success at @entity33
@entity49 secured first win on @entity4 soil at @entity48
@entity4 claimed memorable victory over @entity17 in @entity144
