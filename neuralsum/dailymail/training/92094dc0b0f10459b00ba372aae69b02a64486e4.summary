scientists have revealed the most detailed map of the early universe ever created			0
captured by the @entity5 satellite , it shows the split second after the @entity7 - and indicates the universe is 80 million years older that scientists had thought			1
@entity5 's portrait shows the oldest light in our @entity12 , imprinted on the sky when it was just 380,000 years old			1
this relic radiation can only be reached once all sources of foreground emission , such as the galactic haze and the carbon monoxide signals , have been identified and removed			0
the latest image shows oldest light in our @entity12 , imprinted on the sky when it was just 380,000 years old			1
the image is based on the initial 15.5 months of data from the £ 515m @entity5 space telescope			0
' the extraordinary quality of @entity5 ’s portrait of the infant universe allows us to peel back its layers to the very foundations , revealing that our blueprint of the cosmos is far from complete , ' said says @entity49 , @entity50 ’s director general			0
@entity5 data also set a new value for the rate at which the @entity12 is expanding today , implying that the age of the @entity12 is 13.82 billion years - 80 million years older than previously thought			1
the findings bolster a key theory called inflation , which says the universe burst from subatomic size to its now - observable expanse in a fraction of a second			0
@entity62 , an astrophysicist who announced the @entity5 satellite mapping on thursday , says the findings also offer new specificity of the universe 's composition			0
' to a cosmologist , this map is a gold mine of information , ' he said			0
he says it is made up of slightly more ordinary matter and less of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy			0
' since the release of @entity5 ’s first all - sky image in 2010 , we have been carefully extracting and analysing all of the foreground emissions that lie between us and the @entity12 ’s first light , revealing the cosmic microwave background in the greatest detail yet , ' said @entity82 of the @entity83 , @entity84			1
the image is based on the initial 15.5 months of data from @entity5 and is the mission ’s first all - sky picture of the oldest light in our @entity12 , imprinted on the sky when it was just 380 000 years old			1
at that time , the young @entity12 was filled with a hot dense soup of interacting protons , electrons and photons at about @entity94			1
when the protons and electrons joined to form hydrogen atoms , the light was set free			2
as the @entity12 has expanded , this light today has been stretched out to microwave wavelengths , equivalent to a temperature of just 2.7 degrees above absolute zero			1
the new ' recipe for the universe ' : @entity5 's high - precision cosmic microwave background map has allowed scientists to extract the most refined values yet of the @entity109 s ingredients			0
this ‘ cosmic microwave background ’ – @entity23 – shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities at very early times , representing the seeds of all future structure : the stars and galaxies of today			2
according to the standard model of cosmology , the fluctuations arose immediately after the @entity7 and were stretched to cosmologically large scales during a brief period of accelerated expansion known as inflation			1
@entity5 was designed to map these fluctuations across the whole sky with greater resolution and sensitivity than ever before			2
by analysing the nature and distribution of the seeds in @entity5 ’s @entity23 image , we can determine the composition and evolution of the @entity12 from its birth to the present day			1

overall , the information extracted from @entity5 ’s new map provides an excellent confirmation of the standard model of cosmology at an unprecedented accuracy , the researchers say			0
but because precision of @entity5 ’s map is so high , it also made it possible to reveal some peculiar unexplained features that may well require new physics to be understood			0
one of the most surprising findings is an asymmetry in the average temperatures on opposite hemispheres of the sky			2
this runs counter to the prediction made by the standard model that the @entity12 should be broadly similar in any direction we look			1
furthermore , a cold spot extends over a patch of sky that is much larger than expected			2
the asymmetry and the cold spot had already been hinted at with @entity5 ’s predecessor , @entity171 ’s @entity170 mission , but were largely ignored because of lingering doubts about their cosmic origin ' the fact that @entity5 has made such a significant detection of these anomalies erases any doubts about their reality ; it can no longer be said that they are artefacts of the measurements			0
' they are real and we have to look for a credible explanation , ' says @entity184 of the @entity185 , @entity186			0
' imagine investigating the foundations of a house and finding that parts of them are weak			0
you might not know whether the weaknesses will eventually topple the house , but you ’d probably start looking for ways to reinforce it pretty quickly all the same , ' adds @entity196 of the @entity197 de @entity198			0
one way to explain the anomalies is to propose that the @entity12 is in fact not the same in all directions on a larger scale than we can observe , @entity50 said			1
in this scenario , the light rays from the @entity23 may have taken a more complicated route through the @entity12 than previously understood , resulting in some of the unusual patterns observed today			1
the results show a cold spot extends over a patch of sky that is much larger than expected , challenging theories of the symmetry of the universe ' our ultimate goal would be to construct a new model that predicts the anomalies and links them together			1
' but these are early days ; so far , we do n’t know whether this is possible and what type of new physics might be needed - and that ’s exciting , ' says professor @entity82			0
beyond the anomalies , however , the @entity5 data conform spectacularly well to the expectations of a rather simple model of the @entity12 , allowing scientists to extract the most refined values yet for its ingredients			1
normal matter that makes up stars and galaxies contributes just 4.9 % of the mass / energy density of the @entity12			2
dark matter , which has thus far only been detected indirectly by its gravitational influence , makes up 26.8 % , nearly a fifth more than the previous estimate			0
@entity239 and new : the previous best image of cosmic background radiation , ( left ) , compared to the new @entity5 images released today ( right ) conversely , dark energy , a mysterious force thought to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the @entity12 , accounts for less than previously thought			2
' with the most accurate and detailed maps of the microwave sky ever made , @entity5 is painting a new picture of the @entity12 that is pushing us to the limits of understanding current cosmological theories , ” says @entity252 , @entity50 ’s @entity253			1
' we see an almost perfect fit to the standard model of cosmology , but with intriguing features that force us to rethink some of our basic assumptions			0
' this is the beginning of a new journey and we expect that our continued analysis of @entity5 data will help shed light on this conundrum			2
