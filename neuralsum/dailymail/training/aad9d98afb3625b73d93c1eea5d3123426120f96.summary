i really hope history shows that all the criticism @entity3 , and especially @entity4 , have faced over the past two weeks turns out to be a blessing in disguise			1
every successful coach understands that no team progresses in straight lines			0
there are always tough lessons along the way			0
you do n’t become a bad team overnight and @entity3 still have every ounce of potential they took into the autumn series			1
what is important now is how they respond			0
at times of success a head coach needs to look out of the window and praise those who have contributed			0
at times like this , you have to look in the mirror			0
it is important not to overreact , but after five losses on the bounce there needs to be some soul - searching			0
@entity3 captain @entity30 ca n't fail but hide his disappointment after defeat to @entity33 it was a similar story against world champions @entity36 with @entity3 similarly outclassed @entity3 have had a very loud wake - up call			1
they are a long way behind @entity36 and @entity33 and possibly @entity39 — and it ’s worth remembering those three teams are at the end of their season and will be fresher in mind and body in 10 months when the @entity46 comes around			0
@entity3 got away with two narrow defeats that could have been a lot worse			2
@entity3 have been criticised not just because they have been losing but for the way they are playing , especially behind the pack			2
the autumn series started with 20 minutes of fast , expansive rugby which pinned the @entity36 behind their 22 - metre line and @entity55 produced one of the finest tries scored at @entity58			0
since then it has been stop - start , lacking clear attacking purpose and strategy			0
i have always advocated two playmakers at 10 and 12 and i ’m excited that @entity64 has belatedly opted to use that combination with @entity66 playing alongside @entity67			1
i really hope @entity67 goes well because this two ball - players concept is a lesson @entity3 and their fans need to understand if they want to be the best team on the planet , which must always be the goal			1
@entity67 is top quality and his presence at 12 should add a different dimension to @entity3 ’s attacking play			1
@entity67 ( left ) and @entity66 get the nod to face @entity79 with the latter at fly half @entity82 ( left ) and @entity67 go back years and their experience of playing together should be fruitful for @entity3 @entity82 needs to play flat to the gainline and commit @entity79 ’s aggressive defence in tandem with @entity67 in the way the great @entity89 partnership of @entity90 and @entity91 operated in the 1980s			1
@entity67 has been an easy target this week but suggestions he gets preferential treatment because his father is on the coaching staff are so wrong			2
@entity67 alone is not to blame for a misfiring backline			2
he will know he could have lost his place but this kid is tough , and i ’d back him to embrace the change			0
moving from 10 to 12 does n’t let him off the hook			1
he must go for broke : at 12 he is @entity66 ’s eyes and the linchpin of the backline			1
if he continues to play deep , @entity82 will be exposed			2
together , they need to move the @entity79 defence around by putting width on the ball and bringing may and @entity109 into the game			1
they need to split @entity3 ’s attack and create space for others			2
@entity64 ’s bold move should make @entity3 more creative			2
great sides down the years always had playmakers at inside centre — @entity39 ’s @entity119 is probably the best around			0
i would have selected @entity122 at 10 alongside @entity67 for his pace , range of passing and experience			1
do n’t get me wrong , @entity82 is an excellent prospect but i ’m surprised @entity122 keeps getting overlooked			1
@entity129 ’s @entity128 is another option at inside centre			0
a gifted playmaker with pace , he might get his chance before the @entity46			0
the enigmatic @entity122 ( right ) has enjoyed brief flirtations with @entity3 but is yet to fulfil his potential the mercurial @entity119 goes over for @entity39 against @entity137 in the 2007 @entity46 i fear we lack real speed at outside centre			1
@entity141 never lets the side down but by picking two ball - players at 10 and 12 you need out - and - out gas at 13 as well as at full back and on the wings			1
without this speed at 13 , our potency could be limited			0
i call it a back four and i ’d have preferred to have seen @entity151 or @entity152 selected as both players would give the side more pace than @entity141			1
if @entity3 stick with this 10 - 12 combination , they need an outside centre with searing pace			1
@entity160 has pace , but not searing pace , and if he ’s not available then @entity3 look short of options @entity3 need to move on from the last two defeats			1
this is a positive - looking team and i ’m eager to see what @entity166 will add to the back row			1
i liked what i heard from him this week when he spoke about no - one remembering how good @entity3 ’s culture is if they keep losing			1
i like the individuality and personality @entity166 brings			2
@entity3 ’s players should not be afraid to make mistakes			2
they should be free to express themselves and excite the crowd			0
they need to mix it up			0
@entity79 ’s biggest threat is their unpredictability			2
they gave us a real fright in the group stages in 2003			0
one thing is certain , @entity3 will face some great athletes with enormous physicality			2
discipline could be their downfall and i would n’t be surprised to see a couple sinbinned			0
@entity3 survived a scare in @entity39 , stuttering into the quarter - finals with an unconvincing win over @entity79 @entity195 ( second right ) looks on as @entity79 prepare to face @entity3 at @entity58 their build - up will have been affected by all the talk of going on strike			1
i have some sympathy on that front			0
i was in charge in 2000 when @entity203 and the players threatened to boycott the game against @entity206			0
it was an awful experience but when the dust settled i was actually very proud of the leadership @entity203 and the players showed under difficult circumstances			0
it takes courage to challenge the authorities and while @entity79 will have been disrupted , they will now have an even clearer understanding of what it means to pull on a @entity79 jersey			0
i ca n’t see how @entity3 can lose this game , so let ’s hope @entity66 and @entity67 unpick @entity79 ’s defence and we get the sort of rugby we all want to see .			1

@entity3 have been dealt some harsh lessons in the @entity228 *internationals*
but choosing playmakers @entity66 and @entity67 at 10 and 12 is a solid step
i would have selected @entity122 at 10 alongside @entity67 for his pace , range of passing and experience
this is a positive - looking team and i ’m eager to see what @entity166 will add to the back row
i ca n’t see how @entity3 can lose this game , so let **'s** hope @entity82 and @entity67 unpick @entity79 **'s** defence
