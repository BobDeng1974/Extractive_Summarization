a @entity1 high school has been ridiculed for erecting a sign boasting of its students ' achievements in @entity6 only for the poster itself to contain a glaring spelling error			1
@entity10 placed the huge sign at the front of the school to celebrate its students ' 2014 gcse success rates in @entity6 and @entity16			1
but what staff did n't realise was that the sign claimed 67 percent of students had ' ganied ' good gcses in the two subjects			1
pictured are the signs celebrating the students ' gcse results , with the offending error visible top left @entity10 admitted there had been a ' slip up ' with the spelling and said it was being corrected next to the embarrassing banner were other posters - all spelt perfectly - which described the school as ' a centre of excellence for the arts ' and boasted of its position within the top 100 schools for the greatest ' sustained improvement in gcse results '			1
one bemused onlooker , who did not wish to be named , described it as ' unbelievable '			2
he said : ' it must have been pretty recent because there were workmen looking at it trying to take it down			0
' they 're bragging about their success in @entity6 and @entity16 but there 's a spelling mistake			1
going back to your school days you are told " check , double check " and in the days of computer spell checking - it 's amazing			0
' the fact that the sign is obviously bragging about their success in @entity6 , it 's ironic that they 've put a spelling mistake there			2
' i 'm sure the school is going to blame the printers and the printers are going to blame the school			0
' the irony of the spelling error was not lost on @entity71 users who were quick to share photos of the sign this @entity71 user was left speechless after seeing a photo of the poster online it was n't long before other eagle - eyed locals spotted the error and quickly shared it on social media			1
@entity81 tweeted : @entity10 excelling at spelling as well as exam results			2
some proof reading gone amiss here			0
' @entity85 responded : ' wow ... not really much to be said there ! ' after being approached by @entity87 , a spokesman for the school admitted there had been a ' slip - up '			0
he said : ' this was obviously a slip - up , which we are correcting , but it should n't detract from our students ' achievements			0
