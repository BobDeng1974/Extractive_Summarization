many @entity1 fans will likely be horrified by the customised ' paint job ' that this @entity3 has endured			2
but a rare few may actually love it			0
at the very least it 's difficult not to appreciate the amount of work that has gone into this dragon auto - job			0
a matter of taste : to some this might be their dream @entity1 ' paint - job ' but it 's unlikely to appeal to the masses the scaly vehicle is made from yak bone , each scale decorated or painted gold but effort is no guarantee of achievement , and its questionable whether anyone would genuinely be seen in this vehicle			1
or whether it could still get anywhere near the @entity3 's usual top speed of 156mph			0
sprayed a gaudy gold , the @entity3 has then painstakingly been adorned with the limbs of a dragon , including legs and feet with golden claws , wings on the scissor doors , a tail that sashays behind it and a bonnet that is covered in scales			1
each and every scale is made from the bone of @entity42 's indigenous mountain yak , and is designed with a dragon - inspired pattern			2
the dragon 's claws clasp around the car 's wheels a fiery tail sashays from the @entity3 's boot it might be eye - catching , but whether or not the vehicle performs well is another question , given the excess weight from the bone , and resistance from the design			1
the unique design was on display last week at the @entity60 , in the southern @entity62 province			0
it 's not known if this model was for sale - and if so , if it sold - but it certainly stood out from the crowd			0
the vehicle 's bonnet is entirely covered in the boney scales , forming the dragon 's giant nose baffled : the unusual design got some bizarre looks from spectators attending the trade fair in the southern @entity62 province it is not known if the unique model was for sale at the import / export trade fair difficult to miss : the @entity3 has then painstakingly been adorned with the limbs of a dragon			1

@entity3 has been sprayed gold and adorned with bone scales and *feathers*
the dragon car has wings on its doors , claws on the wheels and a long tail
adornments are made from yak bones and would *greatly* affect performance
