but here are some faces you may not be so familiar with , for these images are of famous @entity13 when they were children			0
and yesterday the four female stars joined a string of celebrities to have shared photographs from their youth for charity			1
prime suspect for a royal role ? this nine - year - old is young @entity23 , now 68 , who went on to win an @entity24 what a model child this girl is : the six - year - old tucking into an ice - cream cone was years away from finding fame as a model in the 1960s			2
now 64 , the enigmatic @entity32 has vowed to help orphaned children find a home is n't she absolutely fabulous ! who knew this girl would one day star in @entity38 ? the 67 - year - old actress is still dressing up to perform , most recently in @entity40 with @entity41 in one , a successful actress and presenter balances on a gymnastics beam , under the watchful eye of her coach			1
the dark brown pixie - cut hairstyle is now a thing of the past but she can still deliver a performance , albeit in a somewhat different way			0
another , who has become a household name for starring in scores of major films and theatre productions , is recognisable from her wide - lipped smile as she poses on a beach wearing a floral swimsuit , while a young model - in - the - making can be spotted due to her skinny legs as she perches on a concrete step slurping on an ice cream			0
this little @entity66 has talent : years later she drops the brown bob and grimace ( left ) for a dazzling smile ( see below ) presenter - to - be : in this gap - toothed school photo she is a little more recognisable as tv 's @entity73 @entity75 : this innocent , chubby - cheeked child would later star in intense drama @entity77 little @entity79 , with a twinkling little grin , perfected anger by the time she landed a lead role in @entity84 honoured : this young @entity85 , now 67 , grew up to win an obe and numerous awards for acting and in a fourth image , a star known for her love of performance proves she had the acting bug at a young age , as she holds her skirt out wide to do a curtsey			2
the female stars are backing a campaign by @entity98 ’s , which is calling for more people to become foster parents to youngsters in need of homes			1
@entity105 , head of fostering and adoption at the charity , said : ‘ without the right foster family to care for them , many vulnerable children may never experience the love and stability they so desperately need and happy memories will remain a distant dream			0
what a character : the @entity117 crime writer looks dapper and adorable in his kilt , bow tie , and sleek hair stylish sweep : this little boy started life in the care of @entity98 's			1
he became top designer @entity125 first a sweet little @entity128 girl ( left and below ) , @entity126 later found fame as @entity130 on @entity84 confident : little @entity126 was confident and outgoing from a young age before hitting the stage and screen dreamy : despite the whistful gaze , this young @entity136 surely knew nothing of the trials and tribulations of romance , which would come when she starred in @entity142 , her breakthrough role in 1997 ' we are truly grateful that so many household names are helping us to broadcast our plea for people to consider becoming foster parents			0
‘ currently a third of all children in foster care are moved between different families more than twice every year due to the lack of suitable foster carers			2
' the number of children in the care system in the @entity13 has risen for the 7th year in a row to more than 90,000 and at least 8,600 new foster carers are needed in the @entity13			1
