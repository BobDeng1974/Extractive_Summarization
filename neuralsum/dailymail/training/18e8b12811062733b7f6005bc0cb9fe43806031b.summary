the @entity6 was immediately taken to the on - track medical centre after he lost control of his @entity9 on the exit of @entity11 before smashing into the barrier on the @entity13 as he attempted to re-join the track			1
@entity0 slid helplessly across the circuit with the @entity16 of @entity17 crashing into the side of his stricken @entity9 despite the @entity20 's last - gasp efforts to avoid him			2
drama : the crowd at @entity23 watch a big screen showing @entity0 walking from the wreckage out : @entity0 's @entity9 is lifted off the track after the spectacular crash at @entity23 out : @entity0 's car ( back right ) is smashed into by @entity17 's @entity16 ( back left ) @entity30 from 0 to 60mph in a @entity31 @entity33 @entity32 during launch @entity37 - @entity36 aircraft pulling out of a dive @entity40 - typical maximum turn in a fighter jet			1

@entity45 - @entity17 â€™s crash at the @entity46 @entity4 @entity2 - @entity0 's crash at the @entity5 @entity4 @entity48 - death or serious injury likely @entity0 eventually came to a stop on the other side of the circuit with sufficient damage to his chassis and minus three of his wheels			1

miraculously , @entity0 sustained only bruises to his knees and ankles in the accident , but is now a doubt for this week 's two - day test at @entity23			1
@entity9 are however confident that @entity0 , who revealed earlier this week that he is likely to retire from @entity69 when his contract expires at the end of next season , will be fit for the @entity73 @entity4 in a fortnight 's time			2
delay : the race was restarted after an hour as a barrier was repaired and the crash debris cleared away damage : @entity17 's rear left wheel scrapes along the @entity23 track after the crash ' unfortunately , my race today ended on the first lap , after i had managed to get away well , making up enough ground to be fighting for eleventh place , ' said @entity0 , who started in 18th after a miserable qualifying session			1
' at turn 5 , i went off the track and while trying to get back on , i must have hit a kerb			0
i then lost control of the car and ended in the barriers			2
' i am really very disappointed with how things went today , but now i want to put this incident behind me and just concentrate on the next race in @entity73			0

' it is the worst feeling you can have knowing that the wall is coming at you so quickly			0
