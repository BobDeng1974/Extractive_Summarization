@entity0 examined 10 playmakers from the @entity2 and ranked them against each other using their statistics			1
we 've looked at pass completion , pass completion in final third , goals scored , chances created and dribble success rate			1
and here 's how the scoring works : if the player ranks first , he gets 10 points			1
if he ranks second , he gets nine points			0
and so on , until the person in last gets a single point for coming 10th			0
@entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 ? what about @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 ? the @entity2 is packed full of brilliant playmakers			1
how can you compare such diverse talents ? @entity0 has attempted to rank a subjective list of 10 advanced playmakers , the men who bob and weave close to the front lines and pick locks			1
it excludes a deep - lying genius like @entity37 , while rewarding the players who thrive in the most congested part of the pitch			0
by using five key indicators – pass completion rate , pass completion rate in the final third of the pitch , goals scored , chances created and dribble success rate – we think we have found the best of the maestros			1
the leader in each category will get 10 , the backmarker will score 1 and the man with the most points out of 50 wins			2
it ’s not a flawless science – some playmakers have had more game time than others - but it offers an interesting barometer of how these men compare when set against each other			0
midfield maestros : @entity23 ( left ) and @entity22 make the list - but who finishes higher ? chances created : 50 ( 5th out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 47 % ( 8th ) pass completion : 81 % ( 10th ) pass completion in final third : 75 % ( 10th ) goals : 4 ( = 7th ) 10th - @entity25 a wonderfully exciting talent who has not yet hit his fastest stride this season			1
he has impressed in front of goal with four strikes and has five direct assists included in the 50 chances he has created			2
@entity25 brings thrills to a game and his dribble success rating is unfair , because even though he has only completed 47 per cent of his attempts , the fact remains he has tried 135 dribbles and succeeded many times			0
only @entity21 looks to beat his man more often			2
where @entity25 is let down is his passing			0
his pass completion of 81 per cent is four down on the next lowest and his success rate in the final third is also the worst of this sample			0
@entity100 ( left ) scored the winner against @entity102 and helped @entity103 beat @entity104 too chances created : 26 ( 9th out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 52 % ( 5th ) pass completion : 85 % ( = 7th ) pass completion in final third : 78 % ( = 6th ) goals : 4 ( = 7th ) 9th - @entity111 when he was breaking youth - team records at @entity113 , not many expected him to truly flourish in @entity114			1
but he is looking to be a quite brilliant player in @entity117 ’s side			0
he has thrived behind @entity114 ’s frontline , scoring four goals , including the winner against @entity121 at the weekend			0
his pass completion is respectable , though @entity114 ’s style means he has actually attempted fewer passes than any other player in the sample			2
his dribbling is exciting and effective , but he has only created 26 chances this season			2
@entity111 has made 88 dribbles - ranked third best in the 10 - and he has created 26 chances for @entity114 chances created : 17 ( 10th out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 48 % ( = 6th ) pass completion : 89 % ( = 2nd ) pass completion in final third : 86 % ( 2nd ) goals : 1 ( 10th ) 8th - @entity138 had his season badly delayed by a knee injury and was recently told to ‘ relax ’ by @entity141			1
plenty is expected of this excellent young talent , who is lagging some way behind his rivals in goals and created chances			2
but his passing statistics are excellent – his passing in the final third is second only to @entity21 , while he maintains a very high passing ratio all over the pitch			2
more than half his dribbles do n’t come off , but he tries more than most having attempted 96 this season , which is the third highest despite playing fewer minutes than anyone else on this list			0
he brings an excitement factor to a game			0
@entity138 has made 96 dribbles for @entity161 - the second best out of the 10 - but has just one goal chances created : 54 ( 3rd out of the 10th ) dribble completion : 48 % ( = 6th ) pass completion : 86 % ( = 5th ) pass completion in final third : 77 % ( 8th ) goals : 4 ( = 7th ) 7th - @entity170 one of the signings of the summer			1
he ’s scored four goals , directly assisted eight ( the most of players in this list ) and has created 54 chances , which ranks fourth against these particular rivals			1
a solid all - rounder who , like most here , takes an excellent free - kick			0
surprisingly for a player in a passing - orientated side , his passing in the final third is a full 10 per cent less than @entity21			1
@entity170 has made 44 dribbles and has a pass completion rate of 77 per cent in the @entity2 chances created : 60 ( 1st out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 40 % ( 9th ) pass completion : 85 % ( = 7th ) pass completion in final third : 78 % ( = 6th ) goals : 5 ( = 4th ) = 4th - @entity193 @entity194 have been a major surprise in the league this season and much of that is because of @entity193			1
he can play out wide but has often been part of narrower systems this season			0
he has proven himself a major threat and has reached five goals for only the fifth time in 14 @entity2 seasons			2
the 60 chances he has created is the most of any player on this list and he also has the best crossing figures			1
@entity193 is arguably the most surprising top player of the season with 60 chances created chances created : 52 ( 4th out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 59 % ( 4th ) pass completion : 84 % ( 9th ) pass completion in final third : 76 % ( 9th ) goals : 8 ( = 1st ) = 4th - @entity26 his passing statistics are good but look poor on a talented list such as this , but where the 22 - year - old @entity222 really thrives is in front of goal , where he excels at creating chances and getting shots off			1
his haul of eight goals is matched only by @entity21			2
for all that , he is also part of @entity233 ’s pressing machine – his 34 tackles is best in the list			0
@entity26 runs away in celebration after scoring @entity238 's winner against @entity239 chances created : 28 ( 8th out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 36 % ( 10th ) pass completion : 90 % ( 1st ) pass completion in final third : 82 % ( 4th ) goals : 5 ( = 4th ) = 4th - @entity27 his numbers paint a fairly accurate picture of a man who can score his share of goals and also passes better than anyone else on this list			1
but the numbers also show that no one attempted fewer dribbles and no one succeeded with less of those attempts			0
surprisingly he has only created 28 chances this season , though he has played almost 500 minutes less than @entity21			1
@entity27 has an 82 per cent pass completion rate and has scored five goals for @entity102 chances created : 40 ( 7th out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 76 % ( 1st ) pass completion : 86 % ( = 5th ) pass completion in final third : 79 % ( 5th ) goals : 6 ( 3rd ) 3rd @entity23 he did n’t have his best game against @entity269 and has managed fewer minutes on the pitch than all but @entity138 and @entity111 on this list			1
yet he is a devastating talent			0
his goals tally of six ranks third here , while outside of our key indicators he actually has the best goals to shots ratio ( 32 per cent ) of the field			0
flattered a little by his very high dribbling success rate of 76 per cent , considering his total tally of 33 completed dribbles is better than only @entity27 ’s 25			0
@entity23 has scored six goals , made 33 dribbles and created 40 chances for the @entity288 chances created : 49 ( 6th out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 67 % ( 2nd ) pass completion : 89 % ( = 2nd ) pass completion in final third : 83 % ( 3rd ) goals : 5 ( = 4th ) 2nd @entity22 the most two - footed player in the @entity2 ? it certainly seems that way , a delightful blur that is capable of gliding to his left or right to get through a crowd			1
a fairly distant second to hazard in this reckoning , though he has played roughly 250 minutes less than the @entity305 , which might explain why he has created 10 fewer chances			2
numerically , the most complete playmaker behind @entity21			2
@entity22 put in a heroic performance for @entity269 as they beat @entity311 at the @entity312 on sunday chances created : 59 ( 2nd out of the 10 ) dribble completion : 61 % ( 3rd ) pass completion : 89 % ( = 2nd ) pass completion final third : 87 % ( 1st ) goals : 8 ( = 1st ) 1st @entity21 unlike most in this list , he does n’t take a central role as he is often coming in from the left , but what a magnificent player			1
a creative genius with a balanced game			0
he has scored jointly the most goals ( eight ) of any of the playmakers in this group , but also has the highest pass completion rate for the final third of the pitch , where the gaps are minimal			0
he is also by far the most prolific dribbler – his tally of 175 dribbles is 79 more than the next nearest and he has a dribble completion rate that stacks up well against his peers			1
he does not fall outside the top three in any of our key indicators			0
fearless and effective – the best in this list			0
@entity21 has been instrumental for @entity343 this season as they look to win the @entity2 title			1

@entity21 has created 59 chances and has eight goals for @entity343
surprise package @entity193 has five goals and created 60 chances
@entity269 's @entity22 has the second - best dribble completion
