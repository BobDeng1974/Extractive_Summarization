@entity0 argued strongly that the pricing for @entity29 tickets should be reviewed and lowered , to be brought closer to prices for other parts of the stadium			0
' as in previous years , due to @entity0 supporters being in the vast majority , a huge number of our supporters will be required to pay a ticket price which we believe is too high			0
' clearly , we feel that @entity1 and other clubs involved should have taken a common sense approach to this matter in the interests of fairness for our supporters and to ensure attendances at the matches are as high as possible			0
' the @entity1 responded : ' the @entity1 notes @entity0 's statement on ticket pricing for the forthcoming @entity4 semi-finals and can clarify the following : all four participating clubs were consulted on ticket pricing for the semi-finals ; the semi-final ticket prices have been unchanged for the past four years ; the @entity4 semi-final gate , broadcast and advertising revenues for both matches are aggregated and distributed evenly to the competing teams , minus a 10 - per - cent levy			2
