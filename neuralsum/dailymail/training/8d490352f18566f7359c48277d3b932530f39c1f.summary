they were armed and brutal men who would fight to the death in front of baying crowds of thousands			2
yet despite the horrific nature of being a @entity9 , their tales have inspired many budding warriors			2
and now , despite @entity12 contests being banned in @entity13 , men can train to fight like @entity14 in an ancient roman amphitheater - at the world 's only @entity16			1
students are put through their paces with a series of gruelling agility , co-ordination , speed and strength tests			1
they are then taught basic weapon skills before they are thrust into the arena in full metal armour to put their new skills to the test in a battle with their instructor			1
@entity55 , from @entity54 , was brave enough to take on the challenge at the school in @entity24 , where he was trained by head trainer @entity59			1
speaking about the unique experience , he said : ' there have n't been any gladiatorial contests in @entity24 since @entity63 outlawed them in @entity13 , so i was unsure what exactly i 'd be learning			2
' first up was an assault course , consisting of ropes , benches and gauntlet of swinging sandbags hanging from a wooden beam			2
warrior : students at the school are also taught basic weapon skills difficult : this student learns some of the basic skills which @entity9 needed to know in order to survive preparations : the student hones his agility skills during his training ' i do plyometric work during my usual gym sessions , so the rope and bench jumps were n't too challenging but navigating through the sandbags required plenty of agility and co-ordination			1
' as part of his training mr @entity55 was introduced to @entity94 , a device with a rotating blade at ankle length and another at shoulder length			2
the aim is to duck and jump to avoid being hit by the blade			2
this device is similar to techniques used by gladiators to test strength but mr @entity55 said avoiding getting hit by one of the blades was no easy task			1
he said : ' all you had to do was duck and jump which sounded straightforward but it took all my strength to avoid getting tripped or hit in the face			0
' i established a rhythm of jumping the low pole and ducking the high one , when @entity59 suddenly changed direction			0
' in the split second it took me to adjust , the low pole caught my heel and sent me crashing to the floor			0
' after the strength , co-ordination and agility drills , mr @entity55 was taken to the armoury for the second phase of @entity9 training - weapon skills			1
action : this student looks ready for battle as he holds up one of his weapons banned : there have not been any gladiatorial contests in @entity24 since @entity63 outlawed them in @entity13			0
but that does n't stop people from still wanting to learn the basic fighting techniques impressive : this is the ampitheatre where the gladiators sometimes train trainer @entity59 said it was during this part of the training where students were taught basic fighting techniques including how to use a sword and shield			1
he said : ' gladiators mostly trained with a wooden sword called a @entity151 , it 's lighter and safer than a metal sword and it teaches you how to judge distance			1
' you have to think about it like boxing , you have a variety of strikes or punches that you can use in different combinations to attack your opponent			0
' gladiators would spend hours a day training on it to refine their technique			0
' having mastered basic fighting techniques , it was time for mr @entity55 to try the armour before going head - to - head with @entity59 in the arena			1
@entity55 was dressed in full @entity9 armoury which included a wide rimmed helmet with the traditional long fin on top , a protective metal sheath for his sword , a short wooden sword and a large rectangular metal shield			1
dedicated : gladiators would often spend hours training every day in order to refine their technique tricky : students are put through an assault course which consists of ropes , benches and gauntlet of swinging sandbags hanging from a wooden beam he said : ' i returned to the courtyard to find @entity59 holding the net in one hand and the trident in the other			1
' now try to attack me ' he said			0
' i shuffled awkwardly , wondering how on earth people fought like this at all , let alone for five minutes			0
' @entity59 struck my shield with the trident , knocking me down			0
i scrambled back to my feet but before i could fully recover he struck again , jabbing with the trident to stay out of range of my sword			0
' he began to rotate the net slowly until , accompanied by a final thrust of the trident , he aimed for the top of my head			1
hold : this shows weapons and armour used in the gladiator training ' before i knew what was happening i was skidding face - first into the sand as he dragged me down in one swift motion			1
he said if this were an actual fight , i 'd be dead			0
' it was an eye opening experience			0
trying to use the moves i 'd been taught while wearing all the armour and weaponry was difficult			2
' it was n't so much the weight , more having to carry it on specific parts of your body at strange angles			0
' after only a few hours training , i was exhausted from the heat , aching from all the reps and sore from the all the cuts and bruises i 'd picked up			0
' i now have a newfound respect for gladiators who , despite their diet and living conditions - not to mention the constant fear of death - were able to train relentlessly day after day			0
