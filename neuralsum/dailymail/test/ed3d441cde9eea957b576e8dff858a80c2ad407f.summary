@entity0 and @entity1 may have played out a goalless draw at the @entity3 on tuesday night , but there was still plenty to talk about after the @entity7 first leg			2
here @entity8 looks at the five things we learned after the two bitter rivals clashed again in @entity12			2
@entity1 must be careful with a talent like @entity14 something has to give at @entity1			1
@entity17 's favoured centre - back partnership is @entity18 and @entity19 , but in @entity14 , who turns 22 later this month , they have a diamond			1
@entity19 's injury trouble recently has meant @entity14 has started a few games , continuing the education that began under @entity25			1
@entity27 ’s coach has fluttered his eyelashes at the @entity30 international a few times during the past year , making sure he 's in pole position should the defender become available			2
@entity14 ( left ) impressed again for @entity1 - and saved @entity14 will be thinking he is more than ready to be the starting centre - back for a @entity7 team and with good reason			1
his performance here was wise beyond his years and his lightning quick turn of pace can help mop up after any errors			1
one sprint back to deny @entity42 was like watching a gazelle catch up with a rhino without even breaking sweat			1
@entity14 saved his team at the death too , mopping up after @entity48 rushed out his goal and failed to reach the ball			1
@entity51 is proving patience is a virtue @entity51 became the most expensive goalkeeper in @entity56 football history when he signed for € 16million from @entity57 in the summer			0
and then @entity58 promptly dumped him on the bench and installed another new player , @entity60 , in goal			0
there were reports in the @entity56 media that the coach did not rate him , that @entity0 wanted to sell him back to the @entity67 side			0
when he finally played , it was a disaster , with the team losing 3 - 2 to @entity71 and @entity51 put back on the bench			2
@entity51 ( centre ) denies @entity74 early on in the contest and the keeper had an impressive game eventually an injury to @entity60 left @entity58 with @entity51 in goal against @entity80 , where he became a hero in the penalty shoot - out which secured the team passage to this round of the @entity7 , and @entity0 's goalkeeper was brilliant again against @entity1			1
the @entity87 stopper was the only thing standing between @entity1 and a hatful of first - half goals			2
@entity51 's save from @entity74 - spreading himself wide and blocking the @entity92 's strike with his right arm - after barely more than three minutes had elapsed was hugely important			1
it was beautiful , crucial			0
the amazing atmosphere generated by @entity0 's supporters would have been dented by a goal that early			0
@entity51 makes a superb save to deny @entity98 ( third left ) from opening the scoring for @entity1 @entity100 was still to come , @entity51 making a superb save from a @entity98 snap shot , which he did n't see until very late , the highlight of a first - half in which he made six stops			1
it was altogether reminiscent of the backbone @entity0 relied on last season , with goalkeeper @entity108 essential in their @entity110 triumph and road to the @entity7 final			0
and all this after sitting on the bench for half the season			0
another fruitless evening for @entity74 nobody can say that @entity74 did n't work hard enough for @entity1 here , but instead that he just was n't good enough			1
the world 's most expensive player endured another frustrating evening , which started in the worst way possible when he missed a one - on - one chance			1
played in down the right , @entity74 had the ball on his favoured left foot , but his finish was too imprecise and @entity51 made a brilliant save			1
@entity74 did n't get involved much in the first half , with the game passing him by as sometimes it tends to do			1
@entity74 ( left ) worked hard again for @entity1 but failed to have the desired impact as @entity0 kept him quiet @entity74 ( right ) sees a shot saved by @entity0 keeper @entity51 as he endured another frustrating night he upped the effort in the second period but to little effect			1
working back in the right - back position he tried to skin @entity134 , but the @entity0 man nudged him and @entity74 tumbled			1
in attack he nearly eked out an opportunity for @entity139 towards the end , but the @entity142 striker was instantly closed down			0
it was that kind of night for @entity1 , and yet another one for @entity74			1
@entity144 does n't play for @entity145 ... he 's at @entity0 @entity0 are good at replacing their strikers , after they are perennially taken by bigger teams			0
@entity148 was replaced by @entity149 , who was replaced by @entity150 , who was replaced by @entity151 , who has now been replaced by @entity42			1
while the @entity152 has n't quite lived up to the @entity27 striker 's standards in terms of crucial goals , he 's as ready for a fight as the @entity158 , and that 's saying something			0
@entity42 , like @entity151 , also gets short shrift from the referee , with his reputation going before him			1
he riled @entity164 up so much here that the @entity1 defender snapped and punched him in the chest			0
the theatrics that followed were part of his skill set of dark arts too , even if referee @entity172 was n’t buying			0
@entity42 was left bloodied after a stray elbow from @entity18 but got little sympathy from the ref @entity18 and @entity42 clash , leaving the @entity178 striker needing treatment for a head injury a stray elbow from @entity18 left @entity42 with blood sprayed across his face , but he knows what the deal is at @entity0 – the pleasure comes with the pain			1
eventually it was the striker who ended up , somewhat harshly , in the @entity191 ’s notebook for fighting too hard in an aerial duel			0
although he could n’t find the net himself , his hold - up play was essential in giving @entity0 some breathing room and it ’s for the best that a row with @entity58 seems to have been buried			2
history says it 's advantage @entity0 this season @entity1 have taken on @entity0 seven times and not won once			0
this was the third draw ; @entity58 's side have won the other four games			0
the @entity207 coach will be pleased with this result , because now a goalscoring draw at the @entity210 next wednesday will see his team through			0
so far this season @entity0 have scored four times against @entity0 , while the @entity213 have netted 12 in reply , including five at the @entity215			0
@entity216 ( left ) will be crucial to @entity0 's chances of winning in the @entity210 @entity0 will be obliged to attack and that will suit @entity0 just fine			2
@entity58 's side are built to resist and with @entity216 up front , they will be able to hit @entity1 on the counter			0
last season @entity27 came to the @entity3 and fought for a 0 - 0 draw			2
they took that back to @entity223 and were soundly beaten by @entity0 , 3 - 1 at home			2
@entity58 will feel quietly confident his men can repeat the trick once more			0
furthermore , like for the 4 - 0 humbling @entity0 suffered in february , @entity227 is suspended and @entity228 , who has been out of favour , will play			2
@entity230 was booked against @entity0 and suspended too , but @entity231 can slot in for him without much fuss .			0

@entity74 missed a one - on - one chance after just three minutes
@entity14 impressed with his pace and general reading of the game
@entity42 left bloodied after clashing with @entity18
