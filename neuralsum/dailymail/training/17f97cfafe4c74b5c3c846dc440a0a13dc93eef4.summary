by @entity0 published : 20:41 est , 21 february 2013 @entity2 : 03:29 est , 22 february 2013 actor @entity3 playing mr @entity4 in the the classic novel - a surname which is one of 200,000 now extinct for the schoolmaster of the classic novel , ‘ mr chips ’ was an affectionate nickname			0
and sadly it seems that ’s the only way it will survive			0
‘ chips ’ , once popular in @entity20 and @entity21 , is one of 200,000 surnames which have disappeared from @entity17 and @entity18 over the past 100 years			1
others said to be extinct – with fewer than five left on the census – include @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
some very familiar names are also on their way out , according to the research by family history website @entity29			1
the surnames of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 are all at risk of vanishing within a couple of generations			1
in 2001 , 50 people or fewer were called @entity32 , @entity34 or @entity39			1
the study compared the prevalence of surnames in that year with the 1901 census			1
the researchers also compiled a list of the traditional surnames which are dying out the fastest			2
that was topped by @entity48 , which was the 374th most common surname in 1901 but has fallen to 12,500th today			2
others include @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
in some cases the decline is because other names have become more common , particularly @entity57 , @entity59 and foreign surnames			1
the researchers said many of the names which had vanished since 1901 had been anglicised by their owners			1
immigrants coming to @entity65 would often do this to ‘ fit in ’ or avoid complications with spelling			0
a spokesman for ancestry.co.uk said : ‘ this trend persists but to a far lesser degree today , accounting for just 6 per cent of current @entity65 residents who have changed their names			2
‘ one famous example of this trend is @entity32 , who was born @entity77 before her @entity79 father changed the family name to @entity32 in the 1950s			1
’ under threat : the surnames of @entity32 , left , and @entity34 , right , could be lost in a few generations the @entity84 also played a part in ‘ wiping out ’ some names			1
the spokesman added : ‘ unfortunately , when specific battalions suffered mass casualties during the conflict , whole towns or villages would lose a generation of young men			0
in the early 20th century many names were common , or exclusive , to an area , so such catastrophes could easily wipe specific surnames off the map			1
’ the study also found that people with rarer surnames were typically more attached to them			2
this is shown in a recent spike in double - barrelled names , which were once the preserve of the upper classes			2
one in 50 @entity65 now has a hyphenated name , compared with one in 50,000 in 1901			0
nearly half of these are preserving a family name			0
as for chips , the study found there were 33 of them listed in the 1901 census , and fewer than five in 2001			0
the real name of fictional @entity117 master mr @entity4 , who appeared in a 1934 novel by @entity119 and a film of the book five years later , was mr @entity122			0
but according to the study , that is on the way out too			0
- @entity126 and @entity127 are among the most ‘ creative ’ names owners give their pets , according to a poll by @entity131			0
dog names in the top 20 include @entity126 , @entity134 and mr @entity135 , while cat names include @entity127 , princess @entity137 and @entity138 .			0

many familiar surnames have died out since 1901
@entity142 , @entity25 and @entity26 among others under threat
