by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 8 december 2013 @entity2 fans travelling to the first match of next year 's @entity4 are going to face an army of dangerous creepy - crawlies when they arrive			1
cobras , scorpions , and tarantulas are all found in the tropical city of @entity11 , while the @entity12 has also warned against the risk of catching rabies from stray dogs			1
@entity16 has also voiced concerns about how players will cope in the heat , which averages around @entity21 ( @entity22 ) with humidity above 80 per cent			1
the @entity25 yellow scorpion is among the deadliest in the world and lives in the jungle around @entity11			1
it 's sting can be fatal to humans ( file picture ) fans will not want to wander too far off the beaten track in case they encounter deadly coral snakes the @entity37 rainforest around @entity11 is home to the @entity25 yellow scorpion , one of the planet 's deadliest varieties , with a venomous sting that can be fatal in children or elderly adults			1
while tarantulas are scary , they are in fact less venomous than a bee and their bite only causes a small amount of pain fans will also want to stay on the beaten track , as the jungle is also home to a variety of coral snakes , which lurk in the tree canopy and on the forest floor and use their fangs to deliver a deadly , paralysing venom when threatened			1
tarantulas also live in the loose soil , digging burrows where they wait for prey			1
while they can not kill a human , their bites are painful and the hairs on their bodies can cause itching and sore skin			2
the tropical climate also attracts false water cobras which can grow up to 7ft long and deliver their venom with a grinding , chewing action , rather than a quick strike , which causes bruising and swelling			2
aside from the stings and bites , which local hospitals say they can see five cases of every day , there is also a range of diseases to deal with			0
mosquitoes in the jungle carry both yellow fever and dengue , viral infections which cause headaches , fever and muscle cramps			2
there are around 100million cases of dengue every year and there is no vaccine for it , with symptoms taking around two weeks to clear up			0
supporters are being urged to vaccinate themselves against yellow fever , which can be fatal as it attacks the liver , causing jaundice and yellow skin - hence the name			0
the @entity107 stadium , due to be completed in january , will host @entity2 for their opening game against @entity109 the tropical heat , with temperatures reaching @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , brings mosquitoes which carry yellow fever and dengue which can cause fever , muscle cramps and headaches rabies is another serious risk from stray dogs found in the city 's favelas , or slum districts			1
the infection is almost always fatal unless it is caught and treated very early on , before symptoms develop			0
it is contracted through infected animal bites , with bats and dogs posing the highest risk			0
there are 55,000 deaths every year from the illness , though vaccines reduce the risk of dying			0
the @entity12 is also warning people to be aware of the risk of catching rabies from stray dogs			0
the infection can be treated early on , but is almost always fatal by the time symptoms develop ( file picture ) @entity11 is also known for gang violence , muggings and drug trafficking and 975 homicides were reported last year			1
the @entity146 has warned fans to be on their guard against robbers and pickpockets			0
the advice is to dress down and avoid wearing jewellery			0
local hotel owners are also raising their prices to capitalise on the event , with a single room now reportedly costing up to Â£ 500 per night			0
