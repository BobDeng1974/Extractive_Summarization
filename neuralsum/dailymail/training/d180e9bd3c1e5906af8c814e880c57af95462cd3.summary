the tank he was driving hit an improvised explosive device that blew a hole through its armor and set it ablaze			2
a chunk of shrapnel lodged in his spine , paralyzing his legs so that he could n't get out			2
he was brought back to live in his mobile home but the hallways are so narrow he could not get his wheelchair through most of them , meaning he was trapped in certain rooms			1
the high school chose to help him as part of their end - of - the - year project to honor veterans , something @entity40 's classes have chosen to do every year for the past 15 years			2
the students were spurred into action after mr @entity3 told his story to a @entity39 history class through yard sales and pizza nights , the group have raised more than ten times the amount they usually would they usually raise $ 25,000 or $ 30,000 for veterans charities and a celebratory dinner but have so far raised more than ten times that amount in just six months			1
mr @entity3 , a father - of - two young children , has been astounded at the response of the teenagers			1
blueprints have been drawn up for the new handicapped - accessible house and the students plan to break ground next month			1
' they gave up their last summer of high school for me , ' he said			2
@entity17 senior @entity87 said some people doubted the scale of their fundraising ambitions			2
he said : ' we had no doubt that it could be done			0
now there are some people in the community			0
' you know , the older people , the people who have jobs , who go through life every day and know the harsh reality of things			0
' those people doubt us			0
but we just accept it and say , " watch what we can do			0
" ' mr @entity3 , who has a @entity107 for ' warrior ' tattooed on his face , has been amazed at the response the veteran is pictured with his two children , nine - year - old son @entity113 ( left ) and six - year - old daughter @entity114 the students raised $ 80,000 in just four months , mainly through yard sales , pizza nights and selling things like t - shirts and refrigerator magnets			1
inspired by their efforts , businesses in @entity17 and neighboring @entity123 began to get involed			0
big box stores are offering discounts on building supplies and construction contractor has volunteered to pitch in when the building begins			0
an architectural firm provided the blueprints and a real estate agent waived her commission			0
the credit union at nearby @entity134 is kicking in money from new loans it writes			0
even the inmates at the local prison held a sale of their art work and donated the proceeds			0
' it 's really just amazing , ' says @entity143 , a local field representative for congressman @entity144			0
an @entity6 war veteran himself , mr @entity143 met mr @entity3 after he learned the former @entity148 specialist had been stuck in his home when the oversized van that accommodates his wheelchair broke down			1
@entity31 load items onto a trailer after a yard sale held to benefit @entity3 despite graduating high school in the summer , the students are continuing to fund raise for mr @entity3 it meant he could not get the 70 miles to the nearest @entity158 hospital to see a dentist to fix his teeth , which were rotting from the effects of the painkillers he must swallow each day			1
mr @entity143 's boss , who chairs the @entity165 , pressed the @entity166 to reimburse local doctors and dentists who agreed to treat mr @entity3 whether they were paid or not			1
then ms @entity40 , who met mr @entity3 at the annual pride of the @entity170 , invited him to tell his story to her students			1
he joked that the fact the horrific incident happened on his birthday was the worst part			2
that part really sucked , ' he said			0

@entity31 student @entity87 hugs mr @entity3 's daughter @entity114 the area of @entity194 , which has more veterans per capita than any other place in the country , honored mr @entity3 at public events			1
with the scale of his injuries , most people assumed he had a huge support network behind time and mr @entity3 admitted he let them think that			2
' i do n't like to complain , ' he said , adding the recurring dreams of burning to death in a tank were bad enough without revisiting them while awake			0
since ms @entity40 's students began helping him , he said the nightmares have almost stopped as the project has given him a sense of purpose			2
the fundraising effort was due to end with the summer vacation but this year 's group have vowed to continue until mr @entity3 has a new roof over his head , hopefully by the middle of 2014			2
@entity221 , 17 , who graduated in june and is now a college freshman , laughed when asked why she continues to help			0
she said : ' just look at him , man			0

' he 's not complaining			0
he 's just so motivating			0
