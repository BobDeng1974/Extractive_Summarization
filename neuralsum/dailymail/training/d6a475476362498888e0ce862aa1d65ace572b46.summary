@entity15 is a robotic camera and laser created by @entity18 after he moved to a new apartment and heard from neighbors that his dog , @entity22 , was making a lot of noise when @entity0 had left the house			1
@entity0 set up a controlled web cam to see what @entity22 was up to in his absence			0
' then i understood that i needed some kind of interaction with @entity22 , ' @entity0 says			0
' the solution came out of @entity22 's favorite toy - laser stick [ laser pointer ]			2
' @entity0 attached a laser pointer to the controlled webcam , ' and every time i moved the camera , the laser moved too , ' he says , which sent @entity22 off in wild pursuit and kept him away from the front door			1
creator : @entity54 creator @entity18 and his girlfriend moved to a new apartment with their dog @entity22 and quickly discovered @entity22 was making a lot of noise when they were out @entity0 says the device meant he could play with @entity22 when he was n't at home , just like they would if they were together			1
but it was n't just @entity0 playing with @entity22 - he made a website so that his friends could go and play with @entity22 too			0
' all of them wanted to have such a robot to play with their pets , ' says @entity0			0
that 's when @entity0 had the idea to develop @entity15 on a larger scale , and gathered a small team about him to put the concept into production			0
@entity15 : this is the @entity54 that 's going into production , which is made of aluminum and glass and has changeable ' skins ' to match your decor ' our goal is to develop a really nice looking robot that can fit any interior , ' he says			2
the prototype is a sleek aluminum and glass box that need only be connected to @entity91 and it 's ready to go			0
users simply go to the @entity54 website or connect through @entity95 or @entity96 to begin playing with their pets , meaning they can be entertaining @entity98 from virtually anywhere			1
puppy project : @entity0 developed the @entity15 for his dog @entity22 but quickly realized that all pet owners want to check up on their pets and keep them company while they 're out of the house according to the @entity54 website , the first @entity105 will be ready to ship by fall			1
the @entity15 has a 160 - degree wide - angle camera that streams 720 pixel video , a low - intensity laser pointer on a moveable platform , a microphone and speakers			1
users can share access to their @entity15 with family and friends , and even make it public so that anyone can play with their pets			0
