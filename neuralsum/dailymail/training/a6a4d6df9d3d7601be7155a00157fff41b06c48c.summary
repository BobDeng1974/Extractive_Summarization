by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:37 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 13 august 2013 commuters face a @entity4 hammering with rail fares to rise by 4.1 per cent			2
latest inflation figures used to set increase in ticket costs hit 3.1 per cent last month , and train companies can add an extra one per cent to price rises			1
transport secretary @entity12 , who sets the rules on fares , said it would be another two years before inflation - busting increases would come to an end as he admitted : ' nobody likes to see rail fares go up			1
i do n't like to see it and passengers do n't like to see it			0
' campaigners say january 's rise will be the sixth time in seven years , as rail fares have outstripped wages protests against rail fare rises were held across the country today , as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008			1
campaigners say january ’s rise will be the sixth time in seven years rail fares have outstripped wages			2
although ticket prices will have risen by 40 per cent since 2008 , average earnings are only expected to have increased by 15 per cent			1
mr @entity12 said : ' running the railways is a very expensive business			1
the taxpayer overall is contributing a lot and i am afraid that the passenger has to make his contribution			0
he does it as a taxpayer and as a passenger as well			0
' mr @entity12 said he hoped above - inflation rises would end by 2015 in line with estimates by the @entity54 's estimates			1
but his @entity56 opponent @entity55 said : ' @entity58 ’s cost of living crisis is leaving families struggling and yet another year of inflation - busting fare rises will just add to the pressure on household budgets			1
big money bonuses are needed to coax @entity66 bosses into improving services , the @entity12 insisted			2
@entity12 was challenged over why extra payouts were needed for the firm which runs the nation 's rail tracks			2
chief executive sir @entity72 and four other @entity66 directors could be paid more than £ 11million over the next three years – £ 5million of it in bonuses if they meet performance targets			0
sir @entity58 intends to leave next year , and is likely to walk away with a severance pay and bonus pot worth up to £ 1million			0
but mr @entity12 told @entity79 : ' @entity80 is one way which is a reward for delivering those services and has been seen across the front			2
' i think there are certain people in the @entity79 who get bonuses too			0
' mr @entity12 added : ' there 's a bit more than just doing their job			2
we are talking about some very , very complicated engineering works that are going on			0
' ' at a time when wages are stagnant or falling , it is completely out of touch for ministers to allow fares to go up by as much as 9.1 per cent again , yet allow private train companies to walk away with £ 305 million from passengers each year			1
' @entity56 would ban train companies from hiking fares beyond a strict one per cent above inflation limit , introduce a legal right to the cheapest ticket and crack down on rising car parking charges at stations			1
' the @entity110 and the @entity109 campaign group planned to stage demonstrations at almost 50 stations to mark the publication of the latest retail price index ( @entity115 ) inflation figure , which is used to calculate next year ’s rail fare rise			1
while the average rise in fares will be capped at 4.1 per cent , the @entity110 warned some season tickets could rise 9 per cent against forecasts of a 2.4 per cent increase in average earnings next year			1
it said rail privatisation was costing taxpayers £ 1.2billion a year despite ‘ minimal ’ investment in trains and stations			2
general secretary @entity129 said : ‘ every year , hard - pressed rail commuters have to hand over an ever greater share of their earnings just to get to and from work			1
‘ wage - busting fare rises are not even going on much - needed service improvements			0
instead , passenger and public subsidies are lining the pockets of the shareholders of private rail companies			0
’ @entity141 , of the @entity142 , said : ‘ getting to work is the biggest single monthly outgoing for many commuters , more than food , more than housing			0
‘ one of the surest ways of stamping on any green shoots of recovery is to price people off the trains and out of the jobs market			0
’ @entity157 , general secretary of the train drivers ’ union @entity155 , said : ‘ the increased costs of travel , and the inability of some to afford to travel , contrasts with the increased profits made by train companies			1
’ @entity164 , of the @entity166 union , said : ‘ the current system of privately - owned operators is haemorrhaging enough cash each year to cut fares by at least 18 per cent without reducing staff or services			2
yet every year we see fares soar way beyond the inflation rate			0
’ protests against rail fare rises will be held across the country today as it emerged that the cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008 but @entity183 , chief executive of the @entity184 , said : ‘ government determines how the average season ticket price rise is set each year			1
since 2004 , it has been @entity185 policy to allow regulated fares to rise above inflation to support investment in more trains , better stations and faster services			0
‘ this is helping to drive passenger satisfaction to near record levels while seeking to reduce taxpayers ’ contribution towards the cost of running the railways			0
‘ to help limit future fare rises , the rail industry is working with the government to find ways of providing services even more efficiently			0

cost of train travel next year will be 40 per cent higher than in 2008
average earnings are only expected to have increased by 15 per cent
transport secretary @entity12 says hikes will stay for two years
@entity110 and @entity213 will stage demonstrations at almost 50 stations
