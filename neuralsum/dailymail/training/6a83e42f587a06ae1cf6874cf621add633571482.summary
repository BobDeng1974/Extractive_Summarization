poet : a rare handwritten draft of a @entity3 's most famous first world war poem that derided the @entity4 for suggesting the @entity6 soldiers were mercenaries is set to sell for £ 15,000 a rare handwritten draft of a @entity3 's most famous first world war poem that derided the @entity4 for suggesting the @entity6 soldiers were mercenaries is set to sell for £ 15,000			1
‘ @entity16 ’ was written by the poet and is an angry denouncement of @entity4 propaganda stating that @entity6 troops fought for money not patriotism			1
@entity17 was a favourite of the troops serving in the trenches , and the draft is expected to attract a number of bidders when it goes under the hammer at @entity27 's @entity26 sale in @entity28 on october 1			1
the eight line poem was published in the @entity30 in october 1917 and the draft , which was written in pencil , shows @entity17 ’s deletions and revisions			1
it was intended as a response to the @entity4 propaganda insult at the start of the conflict , which claimed the @entity40 was made up of professional soldiers who were out for themselves , unlike the @entity4 army mainly consisted of conscripts and fighting for the @entity43			1
@entity17 uses the concept of mercenary ironically to honour the small force of professional soldiers sent to @entity48 at the start of the war who fought and died at the @entity52 in october 1914			1
they were pitched against a well - equipped and larger @entity4 army suffering heavy losses			1
these ‘ @entity40 , ’ adopted from a slur from the @entity60 when he described the @entity40 as a ' contemptible little army ' for holding up the @entity4 advance , saved the nation and paid with their lives			1
working drafts by the classical scholar and poet are very rare because he left instructions to his brother @entity68 to destroy them on his death			1
although he did give his brother discretion to retain any documents he felt would be worth keeping and the poem was probably saved because another poem			1
‘ @entity74 were he and i together ’ , was written on the back of it			2
draft version : ‘ @entity79 ’ was written by the poet and is an angry denouncement of @entity4 propaganda stating that @entity6 troops fought for money not patriotism saved : the draft ( left ) may have survived because another poem , ‘ oh were he and i together ’ , ( right ) was written on the back of it the text , again in pencil , is very faint and a deliberate attempt has been made to erase it but @entity94 clearly felt it should be retained and some experts believe it referred to @entity17 ’s other brother @entity97 , who died in the @entity98			1
others suggested it was connected to his unrequited love for his @entity103 friend @entity17 who had married and emigrated in 1897			0
this second poem was never published in @entity17 ’s lifetime though he did consider including it in his 1922 volume , last poems , only to withdraw it at the proof stage			2
these , in the day when heaven was falling , the hour when earth ’s foundations fled , followed their mercenary calling and took their wages and are dead			0
their shoulders held the sky suspended ; they stood , and earth ’s foundations stay ; what @entity124 abandoned , these defended , and saved the sum of things for pay			0
' whichever interpretation is correct , the poem clearly caused some soul searching for both @entity17 and his brother , ' said a @entity27 spokesman			1
' @entity17 ’s family and friends almost certainly knew of his deep attachment to @entity17			0
' on a e 's death in 1936 , @entity68 consulted another of the poet ’s close friends , @entity142 , about what to do with the more intimate material in his brother ’s papers			1
' @entity142 recommended that he keep them which accounts for the fact that this very personal hand written work survives			2
' the poet was born in @entity153 , @entity154 , in 1859 and is best known for his cycle of poems called ' @entity157 '			2
his work has inspired a broad range of writers , from @entity162 crime writer @entity161 to the production team behind the @entity165 film @entity166			0
@entity167 is considered one of the most prominent @entity170 classical scholars of the early 20th century			0
he was also professor of latin at @entity171 and later @entity172 where he died aged 77 in 1936			2
@entity17 , was born in the tiny hamlet of @entity174 , @entity154 , @entity175 , on march 26 , 1859 , the eldest of seven children			0
his family later moved to @entity153 , where he grew up , and in 1877 , he attended @entity179 , @entity103 where he was awarded a first class honours in classical moderations			0
he had unexpectedly failed his final exams after becoming distracted when he fell in love with his roommate @entity17 , but managed to pass his final year and went on to work at the @entity185 in @entity28			0
@entity17 was the greatest love of @entity17 's life , but he never reciprocated @entity17 's feelings , and went on to marry - without inviting @entity17 to the wedding			2
@entity17 continued to study classics , and became professor of @entity192 at @entity171 , @entity28 , in 1892			0
@entity17 was heralded as one of the foremost classicists of his age , and in 1911 took the role of professor of @entity192 at @entity198 , @entity172 , where he worked until his death			0
