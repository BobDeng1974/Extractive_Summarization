@entity0 has accused streaming services of giving music away , saying his band @entity3 were paid just £ 1,700 despite getting 34million plays the founder of rock band @entity3 has waded into the debate over music streaming , saying that he received just £ 1,700 in royalties despite his songs being played 34million times			1
in a series of tweets @entity0 , @entity3 's founder and instrumentalist , attacked @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and ' especially ' @entity17 for selling his music cheaply			1
he added that he has nothing against streaming , but wants musicians to be paid more , and says it is hurting young talent , stopping people from establishing themselves on the scene			2
@entity0 , who also runs the @entity27 record label , told @entity28 : ' you used to write a piece of music and people paid you to listen to it			2
' yet for younger artists who just want to play rock and roll , by the time they get to a major label , all their rights will have been sold away			0
' there will be not much meat left on the bone			0
you see these huge deals but will smaller bands be able to buy a @entity47 to go on tour in if this is n't sorted out ? ' artists have long railed against the low royalties paid from streaming companies , leading to @entity52 launching his own tidal service this month , promising bigger returns for musicians			1
pop megastar @entity56 and @entity57 , frontman of indie rockers @entity59 , have also pulled their music from services such as @entity14 in protest			1
however , record companies have been quick to upload their music on to these platforms to prop up the collapse in cd sales after music moved online			2
@entity0 , who heads up record label @entity27 as well as playing in @entity3 ( pictured ) , said he was not opposed to streaming technology , but was concerned young artists were getting a poor deal streaming companies have also defended their practices , saying they offer artists a fair price in an age where music can be easily accessed for nothing			1
@entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 banded together to help launch @entity52 's $ 20 - a - month tidal streaming service last month , which aims to offer artists a better deal			0
the membership - based service will operate in a similar format to @entity14 , providing music and exclusive videos that users can stream on computers , tablets and smartphones or listen to offline			0
the ongoing row between artists , music labels and streaming companies lead to @entity52 launching his own service , @entity105 , which aims to give musicians a better deal backed by a host of musicians such as @entity84 , @entity83 , @entity80 , and @entity110 , @entity52 plans to charge £ 20 - per - month for the service , and will give the artists a bigger share unlike @entity14 there is n't a free service and users will have to pay $ 9.95 for standard sound quality or $ 19.99 for ' lossless high fidelity sound quality			1
' tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of @entity14 , which offers lower levels for free users			0
speaking at the launch event , @entity110 said : ' our mission goes beyond commerce , it goes beyond technology			0
our intent is to preserve music 's importance in our lives			0
