prime minister @entity0 was today forced to urge his colleagues not to topple him in a ' make - or - break ' speech			1
' we were elected because the @entity5 people rejected chaos			2
that 's why we were elected , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity8 after a nightmare couple of weeks			1
in a message clearly aimed at his own party members , some who are scheming over his future , mr @entity0 said : ' it 's the people that hire , and frankly it 's the people that should fire '			1
the address - in which mr @entity0 sounded somewhat hoarse - was marked by a series of major backdowns			1
he was ridiculed after selecting prince @entity26 for the role mr @entity0 's speech today was widely touted as a ' make or break ' moment following a torrid couple of weeks , all topped off by a backbench revolt he announced he was effectively banning himself from doling out knighthoods , handing over the responsibility ' wholely and solely ' to the @entity34			1
he admitted he may have gotten ' carried away ' with the awards system of knights and dames , which he himself brought back after decades			2
and his proposed paid parental leave scheme - which would have paid new mothers 26 weeks full wage capped at $ 100,000 - was scrapped after a lengthy period of backbencher moaning			1
mr @entity0 instead announced the government will begin formulating a new childcare and families package			1
and he assured voters the gst would not be increased without a ' political consensus ' - name - checking all of the states and even opposition leader @entity50			2
mr @entity50 's team have been gleefully capitalising on the prime minister 's torrid few weeks , even distributing a game of bingo to reporters prior to mr @entity0 's speech which included known @entity0 catchphrases			1
the prime minister has been shaken by a coming together of various blows in recent weeks			1
at the weekend , the @entity62 government lost dozens of seats at the @entity65 state election and has likely lost its grip on power there			0
mr @entity0 was widely pilloried for knighting prince @entity26 on @entity69			1
and already this year he lost out to doctors when they launched a successful campaign against his plans to cut the @entity74 rebate			0
leadership speculation has raged in recent days but mr @entity0 today warned that his government must not repeat the mistakes of the past			1
' the @entity79 years can not become the new normal lest @entity5 join the weak government club and become a second rate country living off its luck , ' he said			0
' he 's got a tin ear			0
the captain 's pick of prince @entity26 was basically a fatal blow to his prime ministership			2
i think he 's got until the end of this week			0
' - south @entity5 independent senator @entity90			0
' if they think it 's the salesman , not what they 're selling , they will have learned nothing			0
it 's the arrogance which really frustrates people			0
' - @entity99 leader @entity50 ' it 's not just @entity0 , it 's the @entity0 government policies that are the problem			2
they have to reject the cruel and arrogant way they have been leaning on the poor			0
' - @entity109 leader @entity108			0
' we would be crazy to repeat the experience of the last @entity113 government			0
' we ca n't continue as we are			0
we are getting bad feedback			0
' - @entity62 back bencher @entity116 looking at the federal impact of the @entity65 election wipeout on saturday night			2
' the prime minister has the support of all members of his government , including me			2
' - @entity124 and purported leadership contender @entity125			2
the results come as speculation grows that a leadership adjustment is on the cards , possibly reinstating communications minister @entity125 to the top role there have been suggestions that foreign minister @entity133 and communications minister @entity125 may be in line for the top job			1
backbenchers began talking openly about dumping mr @entity0 as leader after the ' catastrophic ' election result in @entity65			1
mr @entity0 called an emergency cabinet meeting on the weekend to restore backbenchers ' confidence following the humiliating start to 2015			1
some of mr @entity0 's closest allies on sunday conceded party members were unsettled but insisted his leadership was not under imminent threat ' a few anonymous voices and a couple of people who have been prepared to put their head up do not constitute a basis to unsettle a prime ministership , ' attorney - general @entity114 said			1
however , opposition members have called for an end to mr @entity156 's time as prime minister , claiming his days are numbered			1
' if they think it 's the salesman , not what they 're selling , they will have learned nothing			0
it 's the arrogance which really frustrates people , ' opposition leader @entity50 said on sunday			0
foreign minister @entity133 , the deputy @entity62 leader , has also been rumoured to be lined up for the job ' all we are talking about now is the timing and method of execution , ' one @entity65 mp told @entity170			2
' this is catastrophic , unimaginable , ' said another			0
and its not just mr @entity0 that some people have in their sights			1
media mogul @entity175 was back on @entity176 again berating the government for its poor showing in the @entity65 elections			0
' shock turnover in @entity182 outing okay government			0
. blank check to nobodies			0
ca n't ignore this a huge message for @entity187			0
people have spoken ! ' earlier in the week the media tycoon tweeted that mr @entity0 should sack his chief - of - staff @entity190 after his widely scorned decision to award @entity192 royal prince @entity26 a knighthood on @entity69			2
the @entity194 reported that foreign minister @entity133 has confirmed to the prime minister privately she would not challenge him for the leadership at this point , but refused to deny it may happen in the future			1
following leadership troubles for @entity0 , the prime minister steered clear of the @entity65 campaign amid fears his presence would be a detriment to the campaign .			1
