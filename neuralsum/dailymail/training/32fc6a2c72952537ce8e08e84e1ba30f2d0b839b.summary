@entity1 's former pilot has hit out at the @entity3 star for accusing him of ' wanting money ' in a pending lawsuit between the pair			1
@entity7 - who claims he had a six - year gay affair with @entity1 when he worked for him in the 1980s - released a statement to @entity10 refuting @entity1 's comments			1
in an interview with @entity13 this week @entity1 , 60 , was asked about the pending lawsuit with @entity7 , to which he replied : ' this is every celebrity 's achilles heel			1
it 's just about people wanting money			0
it happens on many levels			0
@entity7 wants to write a book responding to @entity1 's comments , @entity7 said : ' what @entity1 said about me in a recent interview is an inaccurate description of what our court case is about			1
' our dispute is purely about declaratory relief and will be a non-monetary judgement			0
this is about the truth and my right for a court to decide who is telling the truth , not for mr @entity1 to make a judgement			2
' however , @entity10 has learned that according to @entity1 's representative , @entity7 had asked for $ 10 million to settle the case out of court			1
@entity7 was a pilot for @entity1 's aircraft company @entity48 for six years before leaving voluntarily in 1987			1
the former pilot alleges he and @entity1 enjoyed a sexual relationship when he was under his employment and the pair are currently disputing whether @entity7 signed a confidentiality agreement			1
last july , a @entity55 appeals court ruled that @entity7 would be able to argue his case that he does not have a confidentiality agreement with @entity1			1
when @entity7 left the actor 's @entity59 airline company in 1987 , he entered into a written termination agreement			1
@entity7 decided to ' tell the story of his life and those involved in it ' , including his personal relationship with @entity1 after he was ' unwillingly thrust ' into the spotlight when another former @entity1 employee spilled the beans about their purported gay relationship			1
@entity72 star : @entity1 , shown last week at the @entity73 , opened up about a lawsuit filed by his former pilot when @entity1 ’s attorney learned that @entity7 was planning to write a book , the pilot was warned that he would be breaching a confidentiality provision of the termination agreement			1
but the pilot asserted the agreement was ‘ not authentic			2
’ it was an earlier draft that he did not agree to , he said			0
he filed suit against @entity1 , asking the court to decide about the validity of the agreement and the validity of the confidentiality clause			1
speaking about the fact he has been subject to several allegations from supposed former lovers in the past , @entity1 told the @entity13 : ' also , i do n't care that much about it			2
other people may attack it back more than i do , but i let all the media stuff go a long time ago because i ca n't control it i think that 's why it persists , to some degree			0
' the star was dogged by gay rumors two years ago when an anonymous masseur sued him claiming sexual assault and battery and another masseur joined the lawsuit			2
both lawsuits were ultimately dropped by the masseurs			0
@entity1 said he has come to terms with being the target of such allegations			2
' also , i do n't care that much about it			0
other people may attack it back more than i do , but i let all the media stuff go a long time ago because i ca n't control it			0
i think that 's why it persists to some degree , ' the actor said			0
@entity1 's autistic teenage son @entity121 died in 2009 after suffering a seizure while on a @entity124 vacation in the @entity125 and the star said he was disturbed by some of the media coverage			2
too low : @entity1 's daughter @entity129 , wife @entity129 and late son @entity121 are shown in an undated file photo longtime couple : @entity129 and @entity1 , shown in august at a @entity133 gala in @entity134 , have been married since 1991 ' i found it most offensive with the loss of my son			0
i felt like that was the lowest i 'd ever felt			0
sex stuff is always going to be interesting to somebody , but you stay away from family			0
with that , i always felt like the media - not all of the media , but part of it - went too low there , ' he said			0
the @entity152 star opened up while at the @entity73 for his new film @entity153			0
he portrays a second - generation art forger who agrees to take on a job with his father , played by 84 - year - old @entity158 , in order to spend time with his dying son .			1

@entity1 insists that money is the *motivation* behind a lawsuit filed by his former airline pilot
@entity7 says he will get no money from the suit , but if he wins he will not be bound by any confidentiality agreement
but @entity7 tried to settle the case with @entity1 for $ 10 million
the pilot claims he had a six - year gay affair with the actor in the 1980s and is planning to write a book
