by @entity1 reporter published : 08:13 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 10:38 est , 22 may 2012 the third @entity3 victim of a rare flesh - eating bacteria underwent a sixth surgery as doctors begin to rebuild his groin after removing two pound of tissue in an attempt to fight the deadly disease			2
@entity11 , 33 , says the infection that set in after he received a cut on his side nearly killed him because he did n't take care of it quickly enough			1
the man from @entity18 , @entity3 , is recovering at @entity19 in @entity20 , the same place where @entity22 , 24 , lost her leg , her foot and both hands to the disease after it spread rapidly across her body			1
lucky to be alive : @entity11 watched his infection grow from the size of a peanut to the size of a grapefruit two victims : @entity22 , 24 , ( right ) was infected when she was cut after falling from a homemade zipline			1
@entity36 ( left ) came down with the disease after giving birth to twins surgeons are beginning to use skin grafts to repair the open wounds that he has after a half - dozen surgeries , he told the @entity46			1
' they have to rebuild my groin area , he said			0
' but i 'm feeling much better now			0
' mr @entity11 's condition has improved from ' critical ' to ' good ' after being admitted to @entity19 , spokeswoman @entity50 told @entity53			1
however , mr @entity11 , a landscaper , said his stubbornness almost cost him his life			1
after he received a small cut on his thigh , near his groin , while cutting weeds , mr @entity11 said he started to throw up			1
when the gash swelled , he went to the hospital in @entity62			2
two pounds of flesh : mr @entity64 had to endure five surgeries , but doctors believe they have removed the infected tissue @entity22 , pictured , a 24 - year - old graduate student at the @entity68 , suffered a nasty cut on her thigh when her zipline broke and she plunged into the @entity72 , east of @entity73			1
doctors stapled the wound shut , but it became infected with a flesh - eating bacteria on may 4			2
surgeons amputated her leg , but by then the disease had spread rapidly			1
on saturday , they also amputated her foot and both hands			1
now she finally appears to be on the mend , despite being in critical condition			0
she breathed on her own for 10 hours on sunday , the first time since being admitted to the hospital			2
@entity36 , 36 , pictured with her husband , had been home just 13 hours after giving birth to twins at @entity91 when she noticed a painful spot on her leg last on may 11			1
mrs @entity36 is a paramedic and her husband @entity94 is a firefighter , so they recognized quickly that something was wrong			1
her husband rushed her to @entity97 in @entity98			0
while they waited to be seen , the couple watched in horror as the spot on mrs @entity36 's leg grew a quarter of an inch in one hours			1
she has now undergone seven surgeries to remove the infected tissue and is currently listed in critical condition			2
doctors there put him on antibiotics and wanted to keep him for observation			0
' being the man that i am , ' @entity11 told the @entity46 , he refused and went home			1
that 's when he took a dramatic turn for the worse			0
the wound swelled from the size of a peanut to the size of a grapefruit , he said			0
the next day , he went back to the hospital where doctors told him he was close to death			2
they rushed him into surgery and began cutting out the infected flesh			2
despite the public attention on the horrific disease , ms @entity129 said her hospital , which has a nationally - recognized burn and wound clinic , sees about 50 cases of it each year			2
the nation focused on flesh - eating bacterial infection , called necatoriasis fasciitis , as ms @entity22 's terrifying ordeal			1
necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			2
' @entity143 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			2
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			0
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			0
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			0
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons			0
the graduate student caught it after cutting herself on a homemade zip that broke and sent her plunging into @entity3 's @entity72 at the beginning of this month			0
her father announced on sunday that she was able to breathe for 10 hours without a respirator , a new milestone in her long road to recovery			0
@entity36 , 36 , contracted the condition may 11 just hours leaving @entity91 in @entity73 , where she gave birth to twins			1
she is in critical but stable condition after undergoing seven operations to remove dead and infected tissue from her leg			1
doctors say that despite the strange surge in cases of the rare disease , the three infections are not related			0
mr @entity11 said he realized immediately after he received the cut that something was wrong			1
' i just out of the blue was n't feeling real well , and i went over and sat in my truck for a minute , and i was feeling real hot , and i started vomiting , you know , so we just stopped for the day , ' he told @entity216			0
like @entity217 and mrs @entity218 , mr @entity11 was rushed into emergency surgery , where doctors cut out as much of the infected tissue as they could			1
@entity11 said he 's slowly recovering after doctors managed to stem the spread of the rare infection			1
' i was told i was just a day or two from being dead or losing entire parts of my body , ' he told @entity227 .			0

@entity11 , *32* , is recovering at the same hospital as @entity22 , the first victim of necrotitis *faciitis*
miss @entity22 , 24 , has one leg , one foot and both hands amputated as the infection spread rapidly
