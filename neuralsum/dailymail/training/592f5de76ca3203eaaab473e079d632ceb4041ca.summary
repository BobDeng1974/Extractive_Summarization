at the same time the @entity1 decided individual rounds should last no longer than two minutes , as opposed to the three - minute rounds of men 's competition			1
menstruation was given as one of four key reasons why women 's boxing matches should not last as long as men 's , a list based on ' several facts ... reported during the convention which are of total concern			2
' the change from three - minute rounds to two - minute rounds brings the professional women 's game in line with amateur boxing , including @entity37 boxing , where both men and women fight shorter rounds			1
the @entity1 said that any promoter staging 12 - round fights for women ran the risk of fighters suffering ' severe injuries ' and that it would refuse to sanction any women 's fight lasting more than 10 rounds			1
' several facts were reported during the convention which are of total concern regarding any changes of the 10 x 2 female boxing matches , ' the @entity1 's statement said			1
' women are physically inclined to have concussions , much more than men			2
' a female fighter used to fight 10 x 2 which is 20 minutes , would need tremendous effort to adjust to 12 x 3 which is 36 minutes			1
' menstrual cycle has tremendous impact on the body of a woman , including 12 hormones which act in the body system , creating radical changes in several areas			1
' women 's endurance has been proven to be less than men			2

@entity93 , a blogger for @entity94 , wrote : ' actual evidence is overrated , right ? for the record , the women ’s marathon record ( 2:15:25 ) is less than 13 minutes slower than the men ’s record ( 2:03:23 ) , so i ’m not sure that ’s much of a reason to take such a drastic measure			0
' but what do i know ? i ’m just a woman , who probably lacks the thinking skills to understand this due to all those pesky hormones			0
' @entity86 - based boxing trainer @entity110 trains both men and women at his @entity113			2
he called suggestions that women were n't capable of fighting as hard as men ' rubbish '			0
' in my opinion , women train just as hard as men , ' he said			0
' they only getting punished by another female , they 're not getting pummelled by a man			0
