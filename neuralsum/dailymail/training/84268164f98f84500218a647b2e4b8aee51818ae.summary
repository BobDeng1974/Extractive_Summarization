by @entity1 reporter published : 09:50 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 13:31 est , 12 november 2012 the @entity3 company said it will proceed with its plan for @entity5 to take over as ceo today despite an intensifying scandal at the @entity8 which raised questions about his tenure at @entity13 's flagship broadcasting company			1
the firm 's leading paper , the @entity3 , has maintained its confidence in the new chief following news that mr @entity5 's successor , @entity19 , the director - general of the @entity8 , had resigned on saturday			1
@entity19 took the blame for a news program on the @entity8 's @entity23 programme , which aired a mistaken allegation that a former @entity13 senior politician sexually abused a child at a care home			1
@entity5 , newly named ceo of the @entity3 , arrives at the paper 's offices today in @entity30 @entity31 , former @entity8 director general , is facing questions over the @entity8 's @entity23 programme shelving of an investigation into child sexual - abuse allegations against @entity36 full backing : the @entity3 says it retains confidence in mr @entity5 despite the intensifying scandal at the @entity8 the latest embarrassment comes as the @entity8 faces police and other investigations into claims that hundreds of people , some as young as 12 , were sexually abused over the course of decades by one of their top personalities , the late @entity36			1
it is also facing awkward questions over how the same @entity23 program - while @entity5 was director - general - killed a report that was investigating complaints against the presenter and instead aired laudatory shows commemorating @entity36 after he died last year			1
mr @entity5 said he did not know about the nature of the investigation by @entity23 into @entity57 , and had no involvement in the decision to axe the report			2
he later said he had a ' chance meeting ' with a journalist who mentioned the @entity23 investigation into @entity57 , but said he had not been told any of the details or the scale of the problem			0
@entity19 's departure and his acceptance of responsibility for editorial decisions as director - general , adds pressure to any evaluation of @entity5 's role at the @entity8 and whether he was ultimately accountable for the shelving of the @entity75 report			1
but a @entity3 spokesman said yesterday : ' he is going to be ceo beginning november 12			0
' prolific paedophile : late presenter @entity36 is believed to have abused hundreds of women and children over his long career at the @entity8 in the firing line : @entity23 , presented by @entity83 ( above ) , was due to air claims that @entity36 had sexually abused women , but then shelved the programme @entity5 did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding @entity89 's resignation			1
earlier , he declined to be interviewed about his plans for the @entity3			0
@entity19 stood down after it emerged that @entity23 had aired allegations by a child abuse victim which led to former @entity95 treasurer @entity94 being wrongly identified as a paedophile			2
@entity94 had always denied any involvement and says he will now sue those who made the false allegations			0
following @entity102 's departure , two more senior @entity8 staff today ' stepped aside ' as the crisis at the corporation deepens			2
@entity106 director @entity105 and her deputy @entity107 follow @entity23 editor @entity108 , who also ' stepped aside ' last month following a shelved probe into @entity36 's sex abuse			2
@entity5 ( pictured at the @entity8 's new centre at @entity112 ) is taking over at the @entity3 despite questions hanging over him about the shelving of a @entity8 programme into paedophilia that was axed while he was head of the corporation resigned : @entity8 director - general @entity19 ( pictured ) stood down over the weekend after a separate @entity23 programme aired allegations that led to a senior politician being wrongly identified as a paedophile botched investigation : @entity23 reported allegations made by former care home resident @entity124 ( left ) , who who falsely claimed he was sexually abused by @entity129 treasurer @entity94 ( right ) the duo are expected to eventually return , but it comes just two days after the dramatic resignation of the @entity117 's director general @entity19 on saturday after only seven weeks in the job			1
meanwhile @entity135 chairman @entity134 was fighting for his job today as it emerged he had known of @entity23 â€™s disastrous plan to link a senior @entity95 to child abuse before the show aired			0
@entity36 , who died last year at the age of 84 , is now believed to have been one of the @entity143 's most prolific sex abusers , with hundreds of possible victims			0
the @entity145 is leading a national investigation into the @entity147 'll fix it @entity149 's activities and pursuing hundreds of lines of inquiry			0
former pop star @entity152 , 68 , comedian @entity153 , 69 , and a @entity8 producer have so far been arrested			0
they all deny the allegations .			0

mr @entity5 was head of @entity13 broadcaster when expose into @entity36 abuse was shelved
he said he had been made aware of the probe into late *tv* presenter , but *insists* he had no role in shelving the programme
he starts today as scandal intensifies over separate @entity8 probe which led to politician being wrongly named as a paedophile
