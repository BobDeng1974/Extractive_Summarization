to their astonishment , one came from dr @entity255 , who not only found her file in storage - but crucially , photographs			0
it gave them the lead they 'd been looking for and started putting out public service announcements on women 's television shows asking if anyone recognised @entity173			2
then they got a call from a neighbour			0
deputy @entity272 @entity271 , who took the lead , said : ' the tipster specifically described that they were caring for this cat and their love for this cat			0
' so that was just one piece of the puzzle on the tip that added up to saying " if this is n’t them it ’s something we better check out immediately because it sure sounds like them			0
" ' the pair were arrested in @entity26 on june 22 2011			0
prosecutors at @entity5 's two - month trial portrayed him as a cold - blooded , hands - on boss who killed anyone he saw as a threat , along with innocent people who happened to get in the way			1
