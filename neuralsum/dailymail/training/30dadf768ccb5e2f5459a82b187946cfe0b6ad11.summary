a furious prince @entity0 wants those responsible for printing the topless pictures of his wife jailed , it has emerged			1
the @entity6 and @entity7 looked happy as they ventured into the @entity9 jungle yesterday - just 24 hours after the controversial pictures of @entity7 were published in a @entity12 magazine			1
but despite their relaxed appearance , it has emerged the angry @entity0 is keen to pursue a criminal prosecution against those who snooped on his wife			0
judging by their expressions , though , no one could have guessed that the previous 24 hours had left the royal couple ' livid ' and ' violated ' fun : while the storm over the topless photographs of @entity7 continued to rage elsewhere , they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree on friday night @entity29 confirmed the royal couple would sue @entity31			1
but it has now emerged prince @entity0 is keen to take criminal action , and has vowed to give evidence at a trial			0
according to the @entity39 , when speaking to aides about those responsible for printing the pictures , the angry @entity0 said : ' i want them jailed			2
' a spokesman for prince @entity0 added that he had always felt strongly about privacy and harassment			0
he added : ' it ’s part of a very long - standing and heartfelt position by the @entity6 and @entity46 , given their past , to do everything they can to protect themselves			1
' they ’ve always said they do n’t have an issue with the mainstream media just doing their job , but they have always had an issue with paparazzi whose work intrudes on their privacy			0
' the @entity6 and @entity7 ventured into the jungle yesterday			1
this time it was the rainforest variety in @entity9 , rather than the legal or media kind			1
it seemed a symbolically fitting backdrop to their troubles			0
judging by their expressions , though , no one could have guessed that the previous 24 hours had left the royal couple ‘ livid ’ and ‘ violated ’			2
while the storm over the topless photographs of @entity7 continued to rage elsewhere – more pictures were published in @entity77 – they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree , photographed orang - utans and admired exotic flowers			1
strolling on the canopy : this was the type of jungle they could enjoy , a sanctuary from the vicissitudes of the outside world do n't look down : @entity0 strolls along the canopy bridge high above the rainforest as @entity7 follows him with a glimpse below jungle king and queen : @entity7 and @entity0 after crossing the canopy to a small wooden balcony overlooking the forest this was the type of jungle they could enjoy , a sanctuary from the vicissitudes of the outside world			1
they even wanted to stay the night			0
it was a case of i ’m a royal , @entity105			0
pretty much their every move was scrutinised of course , but even that did n’t seem to matter too much			0
at one point , having been winched high into the jungle canopy , @entity0 spotted a photographer who had been granted official permission to perch in an adjacent tree			0
it must have been quite a shock			0
but where the previous day he had glowered at anyone with a lens , the future @entity115 was now all smiles			0
‘ we saw a spy in a tree , ’ he later reported , laughing			2
thousands of miles away , @entity29 was fighting a legal battle on several fronts to prevent the further spread of the offending images			1
they were taken by a photographer using a long lens as the couple sunbathed on the balcony of @entity133 ’s chateau in the south of @entity135 ahead of their nine - day tour of the @entity138 , lawyers will seek an injunction in a @entity12 court			0
they are also thought to be trying to halt the publication of what is being billed as a ‘ 26 - page photo special ’ in an @entity145 magazine			1
yet the @entity29 could do nothing to stop the @entity77 edition of the @entity148 printing the same topless pictures yesterday , a move that even horrified the paper ’s owners , who were not notified beforehand			1
relaxed : the @entity153 couple even wanted to stay the night			0
it was a case of i 'm a royal , keep me in here on tour : @entity0 and @entity7 prepare to set off on their walk of the rainforest casual look : no designer dresses for @entity7 who wore tight - fitting jeans with a leather belt and green shirt thoughtful : the topless pictures are said to have left the royal couple feeling ' anger and disbelief ' the move was defended by @entity171 , the editor of the @entity173 - based newspaper , which is a joint venture between @entity175 – the publisher of the @entity177 @entity148 owned by @entity178 – and @entity77 ’s @entity179			1
but mr @entity178 said that he was ‘ profoundly dismayed ’ at the newspaper ’s decision , while a @entity175 spokesman conceded that it was a ‘ grotesque invasion ’ of the couple ’s @entity182 came from all quarters			2
the archbishop of @entity188 , dr @entity187 , said : ‘ it would be a very sad day when we are taken into the gutter of believing that every woman wants to flaunt her body for all to see			0
‘ the only time we can not escape revealing our nakedness is when we are born			0
beyond that our culture has said that the only other time should be in the privacy of our homes			0
’ in another development , a female @entity12 photographer who took pictures of the @entity206 sunbathing at the chateau – but not , she says , the topless ones – tried to distance herself from the affair			1
@entity209 near @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity135 , where the young royal couple were relaxing invasion of privacy : the @entity214 by ( bottom left ) on the opposing valley slope is where is where it is believed the pictures were shot with a long zoom camera @entity223 ’s work , which she insisted was ‘ decent ’ , was published in @entity211 newspaper last saturday with no complaint from the @entity226			1
‘ @entity223 is extremely concerned by the fuss and is naturally keeping a low profile , ’ said a @entity228 look of thunder on prince @entity0 ’s face as he left @entity231 , teeth clenched , yesterday morning was obvious			1
but it subsided by the time the royal party reached @entity237 , one of the two states that make up the @entity241 part of @entity9			2
@entity206 was dressed for the jungle in slim - cut beige jeans and a plaited brown leather belt , sturdy walking boots , and a sheer green blouse over a black t - shirt			2
the couple declined the use of ‘ anti-leech socks ’			2
‘ apparently they did n’t pass the sartorial test , ’ explained one of their party			2
however , the @entity7 may have regretted that decision as a jungle leech later attached itself to her leg			1
‘ she dealt with it very calmly and just bent down and picked it off			0
’ grotesque : the magazine put three naked photos of the @entity7 on the front cover @entity265 , a @entity241 prince who had previously accompanied prince @entity266 in a helicopter flight over the rainforest when he visited the region in 1972 , flew in with the couple			1
he said : ‘ they enjoyed it immensely , they asked lots of questions about primates , birds and insects , and @entity7 was taking a lot of photos			1
’ on arriving at a field centre , the couple attended a short briefing with a group of @entity241 and @entity286 scientists			0
they were then fitted with special harnesses and helmets in a private room before being hoisted 138ft up into a giant parashorea tomentella tree using a ‘ counterweight pulley system ’ which had been set by technicians to their combined weight , believed to be about 23 stone			2
as they waited in their harnesses at the base of the tree , the @entity6 looked at his wife and quipped : ‘ girls do n’t have the same wardrobe malfunctions as men do			1
‘ i hope i do n’t have any wardrobe malfunctions			0
’ @entity206 , appearing apprehensive as she looked upwards at her route of ascent , said : ‘ i ’m going to go “ whee ” and just fly up			2
’ @entity0 joked : ‘ it ’s not quite as impressive as the @entity315 , ’ referring to his uncle the @entity311 ’s abseil from @entity313 ’s tallest building			0
dr @entity316 , the director of the @entity319 ’s @entity318 research programme , who accompanied the couple , replied : ‘ size is n’t everything			0
’ the @entity6 and @entity7 had such a good time that they hoped to spend the night in the jungle but their team decided against it lest the unpredictable and fast - changing weather prevented them from advancing on to the @entity328 today on the next stage of their tour .			1

the @entity6 and @entity7 ventured into the jungle in @entity9 and looked happy and relaxed - despite controversy over topless pictures
thousands of miles away , @entity29 was fighting a legal battle on several fronts to prevent the further spread of the offending images
they are also thought to be trying to halt the publication of what is being billed as a ‘ 26 - page photo special ’ in an @entity145 magazine
