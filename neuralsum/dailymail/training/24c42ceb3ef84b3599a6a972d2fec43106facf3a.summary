after closing his eatery at the @entity17 hotel in @entity18 for refurbishment , tv chef @entity2 said that he was going to be telling his waiters to be ' less @entity20 and more high - end @entity7 '			2
instead , he 's focusing on giving his restaurant a friendlier ' dinner party atmosphere ' in order to attract more customers			2
he has said that when it re-opens it will focus more on friendly attitudes and less on long elaborate menus and wine lists			2
@entity2 said : ' i believe there has been a gradual , but genuine evolution in what the customer is looking for in today ’s fine dining offering and we are now moving away from the more formal styles of service			2
' in addition to a change in the style of service , the famous chef has also said that the starched linen used to cover the tables will also go ' on the bonfire ' , in favour of showing off the table legs			1
@entity2 told the @entity48 : ' my number one priority is ending the stuffiness			0
people want to come to relax and not sit there while the waiter talks you through the 10 different ingredients in the dish			0
' if someone comes in and says , " i want three courses and a glass of @entity61 and i want it in half an hour " , we ’re not going to stick our noses in the air and say , " humph why is n’t he having the tasting menu " , we ’re going to deliver it			0
' i want people to have that feeling you get when you ’ve been to a really good dinner party and you come away thinking , " wow , that was an amazing evening "			0
that ’s what we want to reproduce			0

@entity79 recent spent over a year managing the @entity82 restaurant @entity80 , and intends to bring what he 's learned about service back to the @entity12			1
a spokesperson for @entity86 said : ' the intention is not to make it into an @entity7 diner , its all about the service ' ' we 're stripping back the stiff and formal side and making it more engaging and friendly			1
' due to the recession and following economic slump , fewer people are eating out , choosing instead to dine at home or choose less expensive restaurants			0
