a mother who has overcome agoraphobia after shedding 5st 6lb has celebrated her new - found confidence by posing for pictures in her underwear			1
@entity6 , 49 , from @entity7 , decided to show off her size 12 figure in a racy photo shoot for her husband , @entity11			1
it 's something she would never have dreamed of doing when she was a size 20			1
she was so ashamed of her figure then , she developed a fear of leaving the house			2
but now i could n't be happier with my figure			0
' the mother - of - two gained weight after she moved from her hometown of @entity32 to @entity7 , for husband 's job with the @entity35			1
' when we moved away from my family , i lost my support network and @entity11 was working away a lot			0

weight gain : @entity6 rose to size 20 after she moved to @entity7 with husband @entity11 and developed agoraphobia she dropped to a size 12 after following an extreme diet plan but now eats healthily to maintain her shape @entity6 admitted that she struggled to make friends when they moved so she stayed in scoffing ice cream and crisps			1
she added : ' i used to phone for a takeaway that often my local pizza place knew my order before i 'd even told them what i wanted			0
' her size 12 ballooned to a size 20 and this made it even more difficult for her to settle in their new area as she became too embarrassed about her size to socialise			1
she said her shame over her appearance made her feel unable to leave the house and she found talking to strangers a painful and distressing experience			2
feeling fab at 49 : @entity6 said she 's now full of confidence before breakfast : four slices of thick white toast with margarine drink : coffee with milk and sugar lunch : four doorstep sandwiches or six bags of crisps , a tub of @entity83 's , a family bar of chocolate dinner : ten inch spicy pizza and garlic bread with cheese snack : an entire packet of biscuits or sharing pack of sweets after breakfast : shredded wheat , skimmed milk drink : black coffee lunch : @entity99 on wholegrain brown bread dinner : spaghetti @entity102 with lean mince and salad or @entity105 and lentil vegetable stew no snacks her weight then began to take its toll on her relationship with @entity11 , as well as on her health			1
she felt out of breath going up the stairs and doing day to day chores			0
it was only when her doctor advised her to sign up for the @entity117 - an extreme diet that consists of only liquid food for the first 12 weeks - that she decided to beat the bulge once and for all			0
thanks to her diet she lost three stone in 16 weeks and went from 15st 11lbs to 10st 5lbs			1
and as the pounds dropped away , so did her agoraphobia			0
@entity6 is now recovered enough to go out alone and live an active life and has swapped the junk food for a healthy diet of veg and lean meat			2
she even felt confident enough to produce a calendar of underwear snaps for her husband			2
@entity6 said : ' since dropping my extra weight it has been the biggest confidence boost of my life			2
it 's helped me overcome the extreme agoraphobia that i had and i can live a normal life			0
' i feel absolutely incredible - who knew you could feel this good at 49 ! '			0
