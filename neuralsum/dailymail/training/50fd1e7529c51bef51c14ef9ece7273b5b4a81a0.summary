when the @entity1 was built in 1889 it became the tallest man - made structure in the world as well as a global cultural icon			1
it also became a source of jealousy in @entity9 , where architects immediately started drawing up plans to rival and outdo the @entity13 landmark			0
newly uncovered documents reveal an intense competition was held to find a design for what was to be called the @entity18			2
landmark : the winning design , by @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , right , looks similar to the @entity1			1
the winners received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was 215 feet taller than the @entity1 the winning entry was to be built in @entity29 , @entity9 and was intended to be a centerpiece of a new funfair			1
however the building of the ambitious octagonal structure hit a stumbling block as the project ran out of money after only completing the first floor			2
these pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue			0
rivalry : the runner up in the competition , left , won 250 guineas			0
there was intense competition for the design of what was to be called the @entity51 and 68 architects entered designs original ? one design , left , looks like a helter skelter			0
the winning entry was to be built in @entity29 , @entity9 some look like carbon copies of the @entity1 itself , while others resemble bizarre structures of the future			1
one drawing is even similar to a helter skelter and another mirrors the shape of a drill			0
the winning design , by @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was 215 feet taller than the @entity1			1
unusual : this design on the right looks like the eye - catching @entity74 that 's just been built at @entity77 copying ? these designs still resemble the @entity1			1
the winning design was 180ft taller than the @entity74 it would also have been 180 feet taller than the @entity74 , which is the tallest building in @entity82			1
just like the second placed tower , it bears a strong similarity to the @entity1			2
the @entity1 was subsidised by the @entity87 government , whereas the bill for the @entity18 was footed completely by the @entity90 firm , @entity89 , which held the design competition			2
forty seven metres of the winning design was built before it was demolished and @entity93 built the fun fair was opened to the public in 1896 before the ill - fated attraction , still only 47 metres high , was demolished in 1907 after problems with shifting foundations			1
it became known as the @entity100 or @entity101 and @entity93 was built over the top of it for the 1923 @entity104			1
when the stadium was rebuilt 12 years ago the concrete foundations of the tower were rediscovered			0
problems : @entity109 ran out to build the winning design			1
the entry on the right looks much like a drill @entity13 's @entity1 was built in 1889 by @entity113 , and was originally the entrance arch to that year ’s @entity115 – a world fair celebrating @entity87 engineering			2
at first it was criticised as a blot on the landscape , with writers @entity121 and @entity122 among those complaining about the ‘ odious column built up of riveted iron plates			0
’ but it was soon revered as a striking piece of modern structural art , and is now the most popular tourist attraction in the world with an entrance fee			0
it is by far the most prominent symbol of @entity13 , and indeed of @entity87 culture , featuring in countless films , documentaries , photographs and paintings			0
@entity113 originally had a permit to allow his tower to stand for 20 years , but it avoided being demolished after becoming a valuable communication beacon during the @entity141			0

the winning design was 215 feet taller than the @entity1
only one storey was built as the *organisers* ran out of money
it was demolished and @entity93 was built on top of it
