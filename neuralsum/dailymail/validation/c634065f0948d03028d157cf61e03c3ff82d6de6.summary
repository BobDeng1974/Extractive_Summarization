a 22 - year - old man bought a coin that he believes could date back more than 2,000 years for just £ 29			1
coin collector @entity2 snapped up what he thinks is a half shekel from @entity5 - which dates back to @entity6 - at an auction in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the coins are believed by biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay @entity14 his 30 pieces of silver for betraying @entity17			2
lost treasure ? the coin found by @entity2 , 22 , which he believes to be half a shekel from @entity5 collector : mr @entity2 , pictured , bought the coin for just £ 29 at an auction in @entity8 , @entity9 but one expert claims the coin is unlikely to be an original and believes mr @entity29 might have a ' mock up '			1
the battered coin weighs 7.7grams , half of a full shekel 's weight			1
the earliest reference of the coin comes in @entity6 and it is understood that they remained in circulation			2
shekels were used for temple tax in ancient @entity41 due to their relatively higher concentration of silver than other roman coins			1
in @entity46 it is said : ' then when @entity14 , who had betrayed him , saw that he had been condemned , he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ... ' in some translations of the bible , the word ' silver ' is replaced with ' shekels '			0
mr @entity2 , from @entity58 , @entity59 said that he bought the coin as part of a selection but quickly realised he had ' something special '			1
he said : ' as soon as i saw how old it was i knew i had something special on my hands			0
i had no idea what it was though until i typed it in to the search engine			0
' i 'm not really a coin collector , but i just love to grab a bargain			2
' but after looking at images of the coin , one expert said he does not believe it to be a shekel as mr @entity29 had hoped			1
payment : the coins are believed by biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay @entity14 his 30 pieces of silver for betraying @entity17 , illustrated in this image above professional numismatist @entity86 told @entity87 : ' i can confirm that this is not even a coin but either a contemporary forgery , although this is doubtful , or more like a modern mock up of a " coin " believed to be some kind of shekel			1
' mr @entity86 , who runs @entity94 coins with his partner @entity95 , said it was the fabric of the coin and the fact that it has half its surface missing that gives it away			1
@entity95 added : ' some coins have surface deposits but nothing like that '			0
mr @entity86 added that coins such as that is not likely to be found in the @entity107			0
the coin , if real , could fetch up to £ 500 if it was to be sold			2
mr @entity2 has no intention of selling it on as it reminds me of playing with artifacts when he was younger			2
he said : ' we had these old coins lying around when i was a kid			0
they always fascinated me because of the places they have travelled and the hands they could have passed through			0
' mr @entity29 started attending auctions as a teenager and said he loved their competitive nature			0
he said : ' bidding against other people is part way between placing a bet and taking part in a competition			0
' i hate leaving any auction empty handed			0
my home is full of quirky objects that i 've picked up along the way			0
without doubt , the half shekel is my favourite so far			1
