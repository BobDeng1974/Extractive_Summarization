at first glance , this looks like a rodent infestation straight out of @entity3			0
but this is actually a sculpture by the @entity7 novelist ’s great - great granddaughter @entity5 , an acclaimed artist in her own right			0
she forged the rodents from bronze , though at more than 2ft long they are much larger than life			2
the 13 giant bronze rats sculpture , which was created by @entity13 , an ancestor of @entity7 novelist @entity14 ‘ a rat would n’t readily come to mind when buying or making a sculpture , ’ she has admitted			1
‘ but they actually have a lot of humour and make amazing shapes			0
’ @entity5 ’s collection of 13 rats will go on show at the @entity25 in @entity26 from october 1 to 24			1
@entity5 , who is keen to play down her lineage , has created other works such as a judo sculpture for the @entity30 and you ca n’t miss the building , as it has five bronze monkeys scaling its walls – another of @entity5 ’s playful creations			1
other previous work has included a judo sculpture for the @entity30 and artwork for the @entity41 sports studios of @entity44 broadcaster @entity42			2
but she is keen to downplay her lineage , saying : ‘ it is fantastic to be related to such a great writer , but i would never wish to even begin to tread in his huge footsteps			0
