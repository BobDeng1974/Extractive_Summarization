unanswered questions : @entity2 chief constable @entity1 , whose force hacked @entity4 on sunday phone records despite the outcry over @entity9 ’s revelations that police were hacking its journalists ’ phones , police are still refusing to reveal the scale of the snooping			1
at least four forces across @entity16 – as well as the taxman – have been exposed for using controversial anti-terror powers to expose sources and trace leaks			2
but they are still blocking requests from journalists to reveal the full details of their surveillance conducted under the @entity26 ( @entity26 )			1
@entity27 obtained records of this newspaper ’s phone calls in order to trace the confidential source of our stories about shamed cabinet minister @entity35 , who had falsely accused journalists of conspiring to bring him down over his illegal penalty points swap with his wife			1
last night the force – while claiming it ‘ welcomed a wider debate ’ about @entity26 – declined to answer key questions about the controversial investigation			0
it would not say how many phone numbers were trawled through as part of the probe – codenamed @entity47 – into @entity35 ’s bogus claim that he was the victim of a conspiracy			1
nor would @entity2 say how many individuals were identified after their private numbers were revealed through the @entity26 application to telecoms companies			1
and the force would not say what had happened to the data since the probe in 2012 – raising the prospect it is still lying in police files			2
the force would also not identify the senior officers who had approved the @entity26 application , only saying it was a superintendent and an inspector			1
assistant chief constable @entity65 said in a statement : ‘ we welcome a wider debate on whether this specific investigatory power – when used in lawful pursuit of serious wrongdoing – should be the subject of judicial authority or oversight from an appropriate regulatory body when matters of journalistic privilege are apparent			2
as part of this debate consideration has to be given to how material held by the media that might be relevant to a criminal investigation is shared with the police and the courts			2
’ police forces across the country failed to reveal how many times reporters have been monitored using @entity26			1
of the 37 forces who rejected freedom of information requests by industry journal @entity91 , 24 said it would cost too much to trawl through their records , while 13 cited security reasons			0
however , every chief constable has now been ordered to provide the information both by a watchdog and @entity99			2
the interception of communications commissioner , sir @entity102 , has told all chief constables to hand over ‘ full details of all investigations that have used @entity107 ripa powers to acquire communications data to identify journalistic sources ’			1
and the chairman of the @entity117 , @entity116 , said : ‘ i will be writing to them , each of the police forces , to ask how many times they ’ve used @entity26 powers and where			1
i ’d like it broken down by profession			0
’ sources said it will be a huge undertaking for police as , until now , they have not been required to collate figures on how many times they have accessed journalists ’ data since the law came into force in 2000			1
the records can not be searched in a single database , so police staff will have to painstakingly reopen every single @entity26 application made over the past 14 years to see if it makes reference to journalistic sources			0
figures obtained by pressure group @entity135 show police made more than 120,000 @entity26 requests for communications data in a single year – 2011 - 12 – so the total number of files to be searched will top one million			0
as well as @entity2 , it is known that three other forces , as well as @entity143 tax officers , have used @entity26 in leak investigations			0
@entity145 called the police 's actions ' dangerous ' and said ' if they can do it to journalists they can do it to all of you ' @entity153 trawled through phone data for @entity156 ’s political editor @entity155 so detectives could track down the source of the ‘ @entity162 ’ story that led to @entity161 chief whip @entity160 resigning			1
the @entity163 refused to say how many times it had used @entity26 in leak inquiries			0
@entity165 bugged the car of local newspaper reporter @entity167 in a 19 - month leak inquiry that ended with the case against her collapsing			0
the force declined to comment on her case but said : ‘ @entity26 is designed to ensure the powers are used lawfully and in a way that is compatible with human rights			0
it also requires those authorising the use of covert techniques to give proper consideration to whether their use is necessary and proportionate			0
’ @entity184 obtained phone records of a reporter on the @entity187 , @entity188 , to find out how he had got a story about a rape investigation – even though his paper did not run the controversial piece			1
@entity143 also used the law to get hold of phone records for one of its own solicitors , @entity196 , after it wrongly thought he had told a newspaper about a secret deal with millionaire bankers			2
the taxman declined to say how many times it had used @entity26 on its own employees			0
last night , police chiefs insisted they took great care when using @entity26 , and promised to co-operate with the watchdog ’s inquiry .			0

police used anti-terror laws to hack @entity4 on sunday reporter 's phone
trawled through thousands of private numbers to identify secret source
despite outrage they are still refusing to reveal the scale of the snooping
@entity222 would also not identify senior officers who had approved the action
but all police chief constables must now tell @entity117 how often they have spied on journalists
