@entity1 doctors have discovered two genes that affect how well statins work two key genes that affect how well cholesterol - busting statins work have been identified by @entity1 doctors			1
the find paves the way for a life - saving blood test that helps ensure people ’s cholesterol is kept under control			1
the simple and inexpensive test could also be used to identify those at risk of side - effects to statins – so they can be prescribed something else			1
and help doctors target individual patients with the most effective statins for their case			2
statins , which lower levels of artery - clogging cholesterol , are the most widely - prescribed drugs in @entity1 and are taken by up to eight million people			1
they are credited with saving thousands of lives a year , but side - effects from blurred vision and fatigue to muscle and liver damage can deter people from taking them			1
plus , the drugs simply work better in some patients than others			0
working with scientists from around the world , researchers from @entity40 , have now shed light on why this is			0
by analysing the dna of more than 40,000 people taking statins , they found two genes linked to how much the drugs lowered cholesterol			2
one of the genes makes it harder for statins to get into the liver , where they lower cholesterol			1
this makes the drugs less effective			0
the second gene , however , makes statins work extra-well , the journal @entity60 reports			2
lead researcher , professor @entity64 , now wants to discover if the genes affect a person ’s risk of heart attacks and strokes			2
this extra research could lead to people being given a blood test before being prescribed statins			1
if their genes show they will respond poorly to the drugs , they could be given a higher dose , a particular statin , or a different cholesterol - lowering medicine all together			2
keeping a lid on cholesterol could prevent deadly heart attacks and strokes – and reduce the number of people living with disability caused by them			0
it is hoped the test would also spot those at risk of muscle wasting , a rare but potentially dangerous side - effect of statins			1
it is hoped the discovery will pave the way for a new simple blood test to identify those people who will benefit from statins , and help doctors find the best course of treatment for each individual			1
file picture the test could cost as little as £ 5 a person – and take just a year to develop			0
however , studies would have to show it would save the @entity111 money overall if it was to become routinely used			0
co-author , dr @entity112 , said : ‘ statins are one of the safest and most effective drugs in clinical use			0
‘ some statins are more effective than others in different individuals			0
‘ this study highlights … genes that may individually or collectively influence the way statins act in the body			0
‘ in future , this information could help us select the most effective statin for each patient			0

@entity1 doctors have discovered two genes that affect how well statins work
paves the way for a life - saving blood test that could identify those at risk of side - effects to statins , *allowing* doctors to prescribe other medication
statins lower levels of artery - clogging cholesterol , but many people suffer side - effects *including* blurred vision , muscle fatigue and liver damage
