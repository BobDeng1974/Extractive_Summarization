by @entity0 growing pains : splash tv presenter @entity2 has revealed she suffered body ' angst ' when she was a teenager @entity2 has revealed she suffered body ‘ angst ’ when she was a teenager and that she now worries her daughter could go through the same			1
yesterday the @entity7 ! tv presenter admitted she and her husband worry that @entity10 , who is eight , could develop body image issues as she grows up			1
it is a concern that may stem from her own experiences of her changing body when she was at the peak of her sporting career			2
mrs @entity2 represented @entity17 in rhythmic gymnastics but was forced to retire from the sport aged 17 due to sciatica			0
she kept a diary during her teenage years and admitted that she wrote about feeling uncomfortable with her changing body once she hit puberty			1
mrs @entity2 , 40 , who co-presented @entity23 2012 for the @entity24 alongside @entity25 , made her comments in a wide - ranging interview in which she spoke about the importance of healthy eating in her family and being able to recognise hunger			1
opening up about her family ’s lifestyle , and her daughter , who appears to have inherited her mother ’s sporty genes and is a keen gymnast and swimmer , mrs @entity2 , 40 , said : ’ i would never want my daughter to think she had to eat less of something			1
' we talk about over eating , about how that ’s not good , to eat more than you need to			1
‘ but at the same time you can give those messages without it being about body image , it ’s about health again			1
it all comes back to health as opposed to being svelte or fitting into your jeans			0
’ the presenter went on to talk about a diary she kept as a child , in which wrote fearfully about her developing body			1
mrs @entity2 , who is married to @entity59 , 41 , said : ‘ i was always aware , when you do gymnastics you ’re always in a leotard – you ca n’t be any more , the next thing is being naked			2
' and so you ’re very aware of your body so when i hit puberty i did n’t want to change			1
i wanted to stay a little girl ’s body , i did n’t want to become a woman , it did n’t feel that it was right			1
‘ so at first i was n’t really embracing the changes , and thinking “ oh no , i want to keep looking like this ”			2
and i do n’t know why i worried , i was never going to get big boobs , and i was never going to be that curvy , nobody in my family is really			2
ratings hit : @entity2 with fellow splash presenters @entity77 , left and @entity78 , centre ' but even the tiniest changes when you ’re 12 or 13 make a big difference			0
and the irony was a few of my friends were really curvy and all the boys thought they were great			2
' boys did n’t like me , but i did n’t care , i was like “ i want to go and do gymnastics , i ’m not bothered about that ”			1
‘ so i remember feeling , in fact i found some old diaries full of angst – and that ’s somebody who had a healthy attitude towards their body			1
' but obviously it ’s a common issue with most young girls			1
you ’ve got to empower them with something that makes them see their body as something other than a portal for clothes or looking good for boys			1
’ like any family , perhaps , the @entity108 have some health issues in their history			2
mrs @entity2 ’s brother , @entity112 , collapsed and died aged 15 from what was later discovered to be congenital heart disease , while mr @entity116 ’s mother , @entity115 , was a @entity117 , which led to mr @entity116 cutting out wheat from his diet			1
mrs @entity2 dishes out large portions to her former @entity124 rugby player husband @entity59 and their twins , @entity10 and @entity126 , but her own plateful will be smaller but mrs @entity2 , who has joined a @entity129 healthy eating campaign called @entity130 , insisted they are not ‘ faddy ’ about food			1
she said : ‘ @entity59 and i are n’t faddy at all , apart from @entity59 ’s mum ’s a coeliac so @entity59 does n’t eat wheat			2
' so we have a lot of wheat - free food in the house , which does n’t really affect anything because i ’m not really prone to throwing loads of flour into sauces or anything like that			0
’ she added : ‘ and we do n’t eat very much red meat , we try and limit it to a couple of times a month			0
’ but while mrs @entity2 dishes out large portions to her former @entity124 rugby player husband and their twins , @entity10 and @entity126 , her own plateful will be smaller			0
despite doing a gym session or yoga class four or five times a week , she has days when she eats very little			0
and she admitted her diet is similar to the 5:2 fast , which sees followers eat just 500 calories two days a week			0
‘ i ’ve always done that in the sense that if i have a really big day – i ’ve gone to a lunch , say , and then i ’ve had to go to a dinner – the next day i probably do n’t feel as hungry , so subconsciously i do n’t eat so much			0
mrs @entity2 with fellow @entity24 sports presenters @entity25 , left , and @entity168 , centre ' that seems to make sense to me			0
you do n’t feel as hungry if you ’ve eaten loads			0
’ she added : ‘ as you get older you definitely notice it and your metabolism gets slower and you just do n’t eat as big a portion			0
' if you do n’t ever feel hungry , that ’s probably not right , if you do n’t ever feel that sense of [ hunger ] which i do n’t know if we do in the western world anymore			2
’ the @entity129 campaign , which mrs @entity2 is a part of , involves allowing primary school children to visit farms and food sources			0
it is a long term programme that aims to cut levels of obesity in the @entity193			0
and speaking of her reasons for becoming involved , she said : ‘ i get really frustrated when i drive along and see a 12 year old boy who is stuffing his face with really unhealthy fast food and is clearly overweight			0
‘ that problem is not going to get any better unless someone intervenes and helps that child understand what that food ’s doing to him			0

presenter reveals she kept diaries as a teenager and wrote about wanting to stay a little girl ’s body . i did n’t want to become a woman .
now she stresses the importance of *teaching* her daughter about healthy eating so that she does n’t develop body issues
@entity116 stresses girls should be empowered to see their bodies as something other than a portal for clothes or looking good for boys
