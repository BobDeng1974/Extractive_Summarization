when a man from @entity2 had his wish to visit @entity4 granted , he braced himself for the scenes of ' barren lands ' and ' really , really sad people ' that he had seen via a @entity9 documentary			1
but what he found blew his mind - for all the right reasons			0
inside the communist enclave in 2013 , photographer @entity13 witnessed bustling markets , men and women enjoying themselves at a @entity19 looking water park and miles and miles of crops ready for harvest , shattering all of his illusions about what a holiday to @entity4 would entail			1
the complex opened in 2013 and appears popular with locals @entity4 men wearing suits enjoy ice cream in the sunshine , contradicting the most commonly cited cliche that @entity4 is a ' destitute , starving country '			1
one man perches on a kerb and waves in his white socks and sandals unlike other tourists who have visited the country , mr @entity13 did not have to hide the photos and video he was taking from inside the country - he simply asked for permission			1
' i have been curious about @entity4 for many years			1
the average person has probably seen more photos about outer space than of @entity4			1
it 's one of those great mysteries that i wanted to discover for myself and i figured it might just be possible , ' mr @entity13 told @entity57			2
he decided to set about planning a trip in 2012 , by writing and asking permission to do a photographic project			2
' it was a spur - of - the - moment decision			0
i did n't want to do a sneaky , undercover project as i did n't want to get into any trouble , ' he said			2
explaining how he got inside the secretive state , he explained : ' i sent several mails and faxes to multiple @entity4 contacts , all of which are easily available online if you do a search			1
then one day someone actually replied and i met their representative			0
it was a lot easier than i expected			0
' women in brightly coloured bathing suits throw sand on the beach , as others stand with their bicycles in the background			2
in june 2013 it was reported that , as part of his plans to turn @entity4 into a ' world class ' tourist destination , leader @entity85 ordered the transformation of the industrial port of @entity92 into a beach resort town photographer @entity13 stands in front of a bronze monument			1
he has now been on two visits to @entity4 and plans to go on a third this autumn mr @entity13 , a commercial photographer by day who specialises in 360 degree panoramic virtual tours for real estate , hotels and automobiles , has now been on two visits to @entity4 and plans to go on a third this autumn			1
' i was supposed to book my first trip in august 2012			0
unfortunately i was suddenly unwell and had to postpone my first trip to august 2013			0
later when i approached the local travel agency ( @entity106 ) specialising in @entity4 tours with my proposal , the manager was very excited about it and immediately offered to sponsor my first trip			2
' after that first trip , the manager of a second travel company ( @entity111 ) based in @entity112 offered to sponsor my second trip			0
' currently , talks are already underway to plan a third trip this autumn and i ’ve been told that more travel agencies in @entity2 and @entity112 are already interested in marketing exotic tours to @entity4			1
' a stunning view from @entity120 , a 1,638 - metre - high mountain in @entity122 - do , @entity4 a woman in a pink gown gets her hair dyed at an old fashioned hairdressers			2
mr @entity13 said : ' people seem to go about their daily lives and everything looks so incredibly normal			1
' consumer goods , such as electrical rice cookers and other kitchen appliances , have begun to flood @entity4 via @entity134 ' the things i 've seen and photographed tell me that the situation is n't as bad as i thought , ' mr @entity13 explained after he saw healthy looking men and women play volleyball together on the beach ' coming back from my second trip , many things still puzzle me			1
i 've travelled from @entity28 to @entity144 to @entity92 to @entity120 , to @entity145 and back			0
the things i 've seen and photographed tell me that the situation is n't as bad as i thought , ' he said			0
' people seem to go about their daily lives and everything looks so incredibly normal			0
some of my friends tell me that everything i 've seen must be fake and all that i 've photographed are a massive mock up			0
' but the more i think about that logic , the more it does n't make any sense … would anyone mock up miles and miles of crops as far as my eyes can see and orchestrate thousands of people to seemingly go about their daily lives ? ' in the late 1990s , @entity4 suffered a major famine that is thought to have led to between 500,000 and 600,000 deaths			1
however , despite starvation no longer being a fact of life in @entity4 , the most commonly cited cliche about the country is still that it is ' destitute ' and ' starving '			1
fireworks explode during the climax of the @entity171 2013			0
the @entity172 is undergoing renovation so there will be no @entity171 for 2014 young girls hold up red flowers at the @entity177 and @entity178 , a gymnastics and artistic festival held in the @entity172 in @entity28 , @entity4 sights : a woman stands with a black umbrella ( left ) and a horse statue ( right ) at the tomb of @entity186			2
the sacred site was built when @entity188 transferred his capital from @entity190 to @entity28 in 427 ad			0
the royal tomb of @entity186 is one of 63 tombs that exists in five zones of @entity4 mr @entity13 believes that to fake everything on such a massive scale would mean @entity4 's organisation skills are ' far beyond that of any developed country '			1
he was escorted throughout his time in the country but said he had no schedule to follow and was given the ability to move around ' quite freely '			0
he has also reasoned that none of his photographs or video were confiscated or deleted			0
his stunning photos show the streets of @entity4 's capital @entity28 , the countryside , the beaches and the famous @entity177 and @entity178			2
the city of @entity28 seen from the @entity213 , where mr @entity13 was staying a sunny afternoon in @entity214			2
the city is near @entity216 close to the border with @entity218 and contains the remains of the @entity221 palace landmarks : the @entity223 ( left ) is a monument in @entity28 named after the ideology of @entity226 introduced by its first leader @entity227			0
it was built in 1982 and the @entity229 is sited on the eastern bank of the @entity231 , directly opposite @entity232			0
@entity233 ( right ) is ' the place where families from the @entity237 side meet ' different : the @entity238 ( left ) has a restaurant that will cook the chicken that you 've shot			0
and a typical house in the countryside ( right ) he also visited landmarks like the @entity223 , the @entity246 and the @entity247 - the place where families from the @entity237 of @entity4 meet			1
and in one of ' the most unusual dishes ' he 'd ever eaten , he tucked into clams cooked with gasoline			0
' i hope some good will come about from my project as i believe that @entity4 needs more friendly interaction with the outside world , even if it is just tourists , ' he said			1
more information on @entity13 's @entity4 360 photography and video project can be found on his @entity265 page and website			1
mr @entity13 captured a stunning sunset as he drove through the rural areas of the country			2
he said he was escorted throughout his time in @entity4 but had no schedule to follow and was given the ability to move around quite freely the fields looked ready for harvest as the photographer visited			1
' why would anyone mock up miles and miles of crops as far as my eyes can see ? , ' he wondered in disbelief that the things he saw could have been put on as a show mr @entity13 sampled the local cuisine while in @entity4			1
' possibly the most unusual dish i 've ever eaten			0
gasoline cooked clams , ' he joked on his early morning walk around the country 's capital , mr @entity13 hoped he could capture photographs that would show a glimpse of the people and everyday life that has been often overlooked in favour of military and political images when mr @entity13 visited @entity4 he saw workers clocking off at 6pm and heading home			1
contrary to what a majority of people tend to believe , the last decade has been one of moderate economic growth north of the @entity304 the @entity305 shows school children waiting to board a train and commuters leaving the station the streets of @entity28 featured cars and buses like any other city but far less traffic there is more traffic than ever on the once notoriously empty avenues of @entity28			0
in this photo shiny looking cars are seen driving along the highway as the sun sets			0
