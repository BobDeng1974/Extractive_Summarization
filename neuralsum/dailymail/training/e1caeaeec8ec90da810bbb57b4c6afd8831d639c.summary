by @entity0 published : 15:22 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 15:37 est , 2 august 2013 two @entity2 fighter jets clipped each other 's wings midair , forcing one of the pilots to eject into the ocean and be rescued by a @entity9 helicopter a few hours later off the @entity11 coast			1
the other pilot involved in the collision on thursday night was able to fly back to @entity14 , @entity15			1
both jets were from the @entity17 and were on a routine training mission when the collision happened about 35 miles southeast of @entity19 on @entity11 's @entity20			1
@entity31 did n't specify the exact maneuvers the pilots were going through , but he noted that the air wing 's pilots are frequently called upon to intercept aircraft that enter restricted airspace or lose communications in the @entity45 area			1
those intercepts typically require aircraft to fly in close proximity			2
the @entity2 has not released the names of the pilots involved , but @entity31 said both are experienced pilots			1
one is a captain , and the other is a lieutenant colonel			2
the @entity9 said the pilot of the jet who was rescued early friday is in good condition			1
@entity31 said the other pilot has already been evaluated by medical staff and released			2
' we are extremely fortunate to have lost only metal , and not the life of one of our airmen , ' @entity62			2
gen. @entity66 , 113th wing commander , said in a statement			2
the pilot is seen in the ocean after ejecting himself midair from the fighter jet the @entity9 is seen lowering down help from the helicopter to the pilot in the ocean the @entity9 said it was alerted to the pilot 's ditching by a distress signal from his ejection seat at about 10:30 p.m. an @entity80 helicopter that was based at @entity81 , @entity82 arrived around midnight , according to the @entity9			0
it was faster to send the helicopter instead of a small boat from @entity19 , said petty officer @entity86 , a spokesman for the @entity9 's @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity11 at the time of the rescue , seas in the area were about 4 feet high			1
three other planes were also taking part in the training , and one remained in the area to help guide @entity9 rescuers to the downed pilot , @entity31 said			1
the downed pilot was wearing a life vest and had a handheld radio with him in his life raft that enabled him to communicate with the pilot that remained in the area , according to the @entity9			0
that pilot relayed the information until the @entity9 helicopter could get close enough to communicate directly			0
the pilots were flying f - 16s off the coast of @entity11 , like these ones pictured in @entity111 coast guard petty officer 1st class @entity112 , the rescue swimmer on the operation , said it was pitch black outside during the rescue , but the downed pilot followed his training and lit rescue flares so he could be found			1
he said the pilot 's demeanor was calm when he reached him , even though his right knee was in an incredible amount of pain			0
he said putting the pilot on a board so he could be lifted into the helicopter felt like he was putting the pilot 's knee through torture because it was swollen to the size of a grapefruit and appeared to be broken			0
' he was actually just a very tough dude			0
when i saw his knee and saw how he was handling it , the first thing in my mind was like , ` how the hell do you get in this raft and why are you so calm ? ' his training kicked in obviously , because he did everything right			1
' @entity112 said he 's been a rescue swimmer for 13 years			0
this is the first time he or anyone else he knows has rescued a pilot that 's had to eject into the water , but he said the @entity9 regularly trains for such a scenario			0
he said the rescue was the highlight of his career			0
' we 'll usually rescue civilian fishermen or cruise ships , ' he said			0
' to actually be able to get the opportunity to help somebody out , to help this caliber of a person for what he does for our country and everything , is just a really neat feeling			0

both pilots are in good condition and *recovering* well
pilots were on a routine training mission off the coast of @entity11
