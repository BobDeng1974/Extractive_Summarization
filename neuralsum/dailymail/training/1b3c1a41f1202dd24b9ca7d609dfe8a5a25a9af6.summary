@entity0 has asked advisers to examine whether files alleging abuse by senior figures in the 1980s were ever passed to the security services @entity0 made the extraordinary admission that there ‘ might have been a cover - up ’ of an establishment paedophile ring by the @entity9 in the 1980s			1
the home secretary ’s comments came after the publication of a report into how her department handled papers relating to alleged @entity19 child abusers			1
@entity21 boss @entity20 and @entity22 had tried to track down 114 files that went missing in the @entity9			1
just one was found ; another was shredded by the @entity25 , which took possession of the dossier , just three years ago			0
the men concluded : ‘ it is ... not possible to say whether files were ever removed or destroyed to cover up or hide allegations of organised or systematic child abuse by particular individuals because of the systems then in place			0
' we can not say that no file was removed or destroyed for that reason			0
’ their report also revealed the list of names which officials were asked to search under when looking for the missing files – suggesting possible links to the so - called @entity47 dossier			1
it included known paedophiles such as @entity50 and members of the @entity52 , which campaigned to legalise sex with children			0
it also featured senior political figures such as former home secretary @entity58 , @entity59 , and two @entity61 grandees , sir @entity62 and sir @entity63 , who are both now dead			1
police have questioned @entity58 and searched @entity59 ’s home in recent months , but neither has been charged			2
in a statement to @entity69 , mrs may said of the latest findings : ‘ it does n’t prove or disprove the @entity9 acted appropriately in the 1980s			0
’ she added : ‘ there might have been a cover - up			2
’ however , contradicting the home secretary and the findings of the report , @entity74 said on the campaign trail in @entity79 that ‘ conspiracy theorists ’ would have to ‘ look elsewhere ’			2
he added : ‘ i think it is important that [ the report ] says there was not a cover - up			2
’ last night , mr @entity20 said his comments were ‘ wrong ’			0
the new report centred on the work of late @entity61 mp @entity47 , who wrote to @entity58 in 1983 to say he would expose eight public figures suspected of child abuse unless action was taken			1
@entity58 has said in a statement that he ‘ told mr @entity47 that i would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the @entity9 and acted on as necessary ’			1
the files were never published			0
earlier this year , amid revelations in the @entity97 about @entity50 and the @entity52 , it emerged that the @entity47 dossier had gone missing , along with a string of other documents			2
@entity21 chief executive @entity20 has carried out a review into @entity9 handling of historic allegations of child abuse former @entity61 mp @entity47 ( left ) , who died in 1995 , said he gave details of establishment paedophiles – known as ' @entity109 dossier ' – to then home secretary @entity58 ( right ) in 1983 after an initial review by the @entity9 found they could not be traced , mrs may appointed mr @entity20 and mr @entity112 to conduct a full trawl across @entity114			1
yesterday , the two men said one file had come to light as a result of ‘ heightened awareness ’ of the subject in the @entity9 – but none of @entity47 ’ were found			1
the report also failed to rule out a whistleblower ’s claims that the @entity9 directly awarded tens of thousands of pounds of public money to the pie			0
@entity126 , the @entity127 mp who has raised the issue of historic child abuse , branded the review a ‘ whitewash ’			0
he said : ‘ we [ can not ] just gloss over the past and hope it all goes away			0

@entity21 *'s* @entity20 found no evidence of @entity9 cover - up
@entity9 filing system makes it hard to piece ' what was known '
@entity61 mp @entity47 *compiled* details of @entity145 abuse
says he gave the dossier to then - home secretary @entity58 in 1983
@entity58 has *flatly* *denied* failing to deal with the alleged dossier
