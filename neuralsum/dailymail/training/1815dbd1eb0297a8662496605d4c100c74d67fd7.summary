@entity0 would fight @entity2 a couple of years later , getting knocked out in the sixth round in @entity19 , @entity20			1
he was a prodigious puncher whose bid to fight in the @entity31 ended at the hands of @entity33 , who later dealt @entity0 his first professional loss			1
he had a starring role in ' @entity22 ' alongside @entity36			2
and perhaps most memorably , @entity0 tested positive for @entity4 when the virus still carried a significant stigma , only to declare later the test was false			1
his mother , @entity40 , told @entity41 he had been in denial about having @entity4 ever since receiving the first test results			2
he hated people to know he was sick			2
she said , adding that he got pectoral implants to make himself look bigger and stronger			2

he was unable to speak and relied on a ventilator			2
no 1 fan : @entity0 celebrates his win over @entity3 with his mother in @entity52 in 1993 fighter : @entity0 in @entity20 in april 2011 ' he 's in the end stages			1
that 's it , ' she said in an interview last month			2
' i tell him that the family loves him , he 's always in our prayers ... i do n't tell him to keep fighting or nothing , because i want him to go			2
' because of numerous legal issues , including a prison sentence that stemmed from weapons and drunk driving , @entity0 's name became attached to headlines that would eventually overshadow his work in the ring			1
' if @entity73 was fighting today , he no doubt would be a world champion , ' @entity7 said			2
' you have to look at who he was fighting in the ' 90s , the guys in that division were @entity25 , @entity2 , @entity80 , @entity33 , @entity3			1
there 's no one with that talent today			0
@entity73 would absolutely dominate if he were in his prime boxing today			0
' @entity0 won his first 28 professional fights , beating faded champions such as @entity87 along the way			1
his career reached its apex in the summer of 1993 with a unanimous decision over @entity3 , then in the midst of his comeback , to claim a vacant title			1
big screen : @entity0 appearing as @entity96 alongside @entity36 in @entity22 as with so many things in @entity0 's life , the good was quickly followed by the bad			1
@entity0 was in line for a high - profile bout with @entity2 when he was upset by @entity15 in @entity103 , @entity104 , not far from where @entity0 was raised			1
he was knocked down three times and the fight was called before the first round ended			0
along with the stinging defeat , @entity0 saw a potential $ 7.5 million payday for a title unification fight against @entity2 wash away			1
' i zigged when i should have zagged , ' @entity0 said afterward			1
' it 's one of those situations you have to live with and learn from it			0
' @entity0 indeed came back , but he was never the same feared fighter			1
he beat a bunch of long shots and faded stars over the next couple of years before his loss to @entity2			1
that fight happened in october 1995			0
by february , @entity0 had tested positive for @entity4			1
he 'd been preparing for another fight that winter when his blood test came back positive for the virus that causes @entity126			0
@entity0 's license was quickly suspended by @entity128 , and the ban was , in effect , upheld by every other sanctioning body			1
' @entity73 had a hard time with it back then , ' @entity7 told @entity41			0
' people would n't shake his hand , would n't come close to him , would n't let babies next to him			0
' ' you took a kid from this height of stardom , being in movies , to the point where everyone wanted to be @entity0 's friend to the point where , man , nobody wanted to be in the same room with him			1
and it was heartbreaking , ' he said			0
@entity0 said at a news conference after receiving his test results that he 'd never fight again , blaming his plight on a ' permissive , fast and reckless lifestyle			1
' his lifestyle never changed , though , even when he stepped away from the ring			0
he had already run afoul of the law in 1993 , when he pleaded guilty to assaulting a college student			0
he also dealt with weapons charges and multiple @entity160 incidents over the years			0
he was finally sentenced to two years in prison in 2000 , and another year was added to his sentence in 2002 for violating parole			0
@entity164 : @entity0 was crowned @entity13 heavyweight champion in 1993 after defeating @entity3 in @entity52 when he was released , @entity0 said his hiv tests had resulted in false positives , and he wanted to resume his career			1
he passed medical tests in @entity170 - even as @entity128 stood by its decision - and returned to the ring			0
@entity0 fought twice more in his career , winning once in @entity173 and for the final time in @entity175			2
he finished with a record of 48 - 3 - 1 with 42 knockouts			0
' @entity73 's a very stubborn person and he views things the way he wants to view things			0
that 's his right and privilege , ' @entity7 said			0
' all through his career , him and i would come not to physical blows but disagreements on certain things			0
we always ended up friends			0
' that 's the way @entity73 took off after he was told he was @entity4 - positive , " @entity7 added			0
" when he first was told , i was taking him to seek treatment and to different doctors around the country			0
and then he started research on the @entity198 and started saying it was a conspiracy			0
he went in that direction and never looked back			0
