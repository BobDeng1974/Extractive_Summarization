by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:14 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 03:45 est , 26 september 2013 @entity2 sparked a furious row over immigration last night after accusing the @entity5 of using the ‘ language of the @entity7 ’			1
the shadow home secretary used her speech to the @entity11 conference to launch a ferocious attack on the @entity5 ’ crackdown on illegal immigration			1
one conservative mp last night described miss @entity2 ’s intervention as ‘ despicable ’ , and said it showed @entity11 was still not serious about tackling illegal immigrants			2
controversy : the @entity21 vans drove through six @entity23 boroughs as part of an initiative to reduce illegal immigration miss @entity2 singled out a @entity21 advertising campaign which warned those here illegally to ‘ go home or face arrest ’			1
the ads , displayed on billboards carried by vans , were trialled in several @entity23 boroughs during the summer			1
miss @entity2 also criticised immigration checks at @entity36 , which she said were based on racial profiling			2
she said both measures were ‘ divisive gimmicks ’ and ‘ an utter disgrace ’			0
she added : ‘ unlike the @entity5 , we will not do checks at @entity36 asking @entity44 people to prove their immigration status , targeted at people for the colour of their skin			1
shadow home secretary @entity2 told the @entity11 conference the part had to talk about immigration @entity11 today promised to make identity theft a specific criminal offence , in a bid to stem the tide of online crime			1
shadow home secretary @entity2 told the @entity11 conference that police are struggling to cope with net fraud			1
the @entity60 estimates online crime in the retail sector alone costs £ 200million a year			0
although fraudsters can be convicted of a series of crimes , a @entity11 source said the lack of an offence specifically relating to identity theft ‘ leads to some confusion about how to arrest or charge people ’			1
miss @entity2 said : ' we live our lives online now – but criminals know that too			0
it ’s a big risk for business			0
and it ’s a big cost for all of us			0
‘ when the credit card companies and banks write off fraud we all lose out from higher charges			0
the problem is escalating by the day			0
‘ the police ca n’t do this alone			0
they do n’t stand a chance			0
we need changes in the law to make it easier to prosecute identity theft			1
’ @entity11 would also set up a new quango , @entity92 , to co-ordinate action against online criminals			2
‘ and unlike the @entity5 , we wo n’t do ad vans sent to the highest black and ethnic @entity44 communities , borrowing the language of the 1970s @entity7			2
‘ just consider those ad vans were driving past the homes of families whose parents and grandparents had to endure those same slogans scrawled high in graffiti 40 years ago , whose children now run local businesses , work in hospitals and schools , serve their country in our armed forces			0
’ conservative mp @entity112 fiercely rejected miss @entity2 ’s claims and warned @entity11 could not be trusted to deal with the legacy of illegal immigration it had left behind			1
mr @entity112 said : ‘ i am very supportive of the ad vans – we want people who are here illegally to go home and it is in their interests to offer them the option of a voluntary return			2
‘ @entity2 ’s comments are disgraceful and show just how out of touch @entity11 is with public concerns about illegal immigration			1
they are nothing more than an attempt to cover up @entity11 ’s abject failure on the issue			2
’ @entity132 has pledged to veto any repeat of the @entity21 initiative			2
but polls suggest the tough message is supported by the public			0
a 20,000 - strong survey by former @entity5 treasurer @entity139 showed 79 per cent of people backed the ‘ go home ’ vans			1
vans displaying billboards warning overstaying migrants ‘ go home , or you 'll be picked up and deported ’ toured six @entity23 boroughs in july			1
the @entity149 claim not to have been consulted about the vans , with @entity132 insisting he will veto plans to use them nationwide			1
@entity152 leader @entity151 said they were ‘ not the @entity44 way of doing things ’			0
miss @entity2 added : ‘ it really comes to something when even ( @entity152 leader ) @entity151 says you have gone too far			0
‘ those ad vans were not about illegal immigration and i say enough of the divisive gimmicks , they are an utter disgrace			0
’ @entity11 ’s flagship immigration policy unravelled this week , after @entity165 vowed to force companies which bring skilled foreign workers into the @entity44 to also hire a ‘ local ’ apprentice			1
but it emerged that the apprenticeships would have to be offered to anyone from within the @entity172			0
ms @entity2 rejected the idea that @entity11 could not debate immigration			1
she added : ‘ some people say @entity11 should n't talk about immigration			1
that it is pandering to prejudice or to the right			0
‘ we do n't have a mature and honest debate about immigration , we leave it to the divisive politics of the right			0
‘ that 's why we have set out practical policies but i will not join an arms race of rhetoric on immigration			0
‘ and this party will never use immigration to play divide and rule			1
’ but conservative immigration minister @entity193 said : ' conservatives have cut net immigration by a third since 2010 but shamefully @entity11 have opposed every single step we have taken to achieve that			1
@entity11 let the @entity44 people down badly when they were in office with uncontrolled immigration , net migration of more than 2.2 million and abuse of the visa system which was rife			2
‘ it is clear that the same old @entity11 have learned nothing from their past mistakes			2
they have no idea how to control immigration so that it works in our national interest			0
they have no credibility on this issue and the @entity44 people will never trust them on it again			0

billboards caused a storm after touring six @entity23 boroughs
@entity11 accuses government of using immigration to play ' divide and rule '
@entity5 ministers insist the campaign worked and want it rolled out nationally
@entity149 *including* @entity132 dismissed it as a *pointless* stunt
