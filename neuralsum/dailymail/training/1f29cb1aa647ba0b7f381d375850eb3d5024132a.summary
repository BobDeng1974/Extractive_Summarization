until 12 days before the referendum , @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 were all convinced victory for the @entity5 was a foregone conclusion			1
with good reason , it appeared			0
historically , breaking from the @entity9 has rarely been supported by much more than a third of people in @entity12			1
even as the debate hotted up this year , for all @entity15 ’s bluster he did not seem to be gaining much ground			0
the organisers of two admitted to unintended errors			0
the third , conducted by influential pollsters @entity20 on september 6 , and published by @entity21 , owned by @entity22 ’s @entity35 , caused a sensation			1
it claimed the ‘ yes ’ camp had surged into the lead on 51 , with ‘ no ’ on 49 , a two - point lead			0
gleeful mr @entity22 seized on it to pile pressure on @entity0 and @entity1 , boasting on @entity43 that his ‘ reliable independence poll will shock @entity9 and more – everything up for grabs ’			1
he also tweeted : ‘ @entity12 independence means huge black eye for @entity0 and @entity1			2
’ @entity20 ’s two - point lead for @entity12 nationalists convinced the @entity51 that they were on the verge of a historic breakthrough – and caused a nervous breakdown in @entity55			1
@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 had seen support for independence creep up in the last few weeks of the campaign , but believed it was too little too late			2
the poll turned all that upside down			2
the three party leaders were gripped with terror that the unthinkable was about to happen : the @entity9 was about to be broken up			1
they would all probably resign in shame and a place would be found in the history books for @entity0 next to @entity68 – pm when @entity9 lost @entity69			1
so they did what politicians do in a crisis – panicked and threw money at it			0
@entity76 and @entity1 called off their weekly joust in prime minister ’s questions and , @entity2 in tow , scurried north to rally the @entity81 vote			0
just three days before @entity83 they vowed to extend the @entity85 formula , whereby @entity12 get £ 1,600 per head more from taxpayers than people in @entity89 , worth £ 4.5 billion a year , or £ 45 billion over the next decade			1
so much for ‘ austerity @entity9 ’			2
and for good measure they promised more home rule for @entity12 – without bothering to consult anybody			2
cynics called it a bribe			0
the three party leaders rushed to @entity12 to give speeches after the shock poll , including @entity1 who was hounded out of a shopping centre yet , when the referendum result was announced , it appeared they need n’t have worried after all			1
if the ‘ no ’ camp had won by a whisker , @entity0 and co could have claimed their last - minute offer made all the difference			0
instead the ‘ no ’ camp won by an overwhelming ten - point margin , a 12 - point turnaround from the @entity20 poll 12 days earlier			1
it led some to ask if it was a ‘ rogue poll ’			0
one day before the referendum a @entity20 poll showed the ‘ no ’ camp back in the lead by two points			1
there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by @entity20			2
all opinion polls are subject to a margin of error and , unlike for general elections , polling companies did not have past results to help refine their results			0
@entity20 president @entity129 defended the survey which showed the ‘ yes ’ camp ahead by two			1
‘ it was not a rogue poll , ’ he said			0
‘ there was a whole series of polls following ours showing it was neck and neck , 50 - 50 plus or minus one			0

@entity20 poll for @entity21 put ' yes ' campaign two points ahead
party leaders *suddenly* found themselves with 12 days to save the @entity9
@entity22 , owner of the paper , used poll to pile pressure on leaders
they *dashed* to @entity12 and *pledged* to hand the country more powers
