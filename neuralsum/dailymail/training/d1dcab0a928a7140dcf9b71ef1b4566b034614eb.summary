@entity0 savoured a memorable career highlight four years ago , despite the painful conclusion , but the @entity4 prop hopes it will be surpassed over the coming days			1
it was across the road from the country ’s rugby hq that the @entity10 tighthead and her team - mates strove to break @entity13 dominance of the women ’s @entity14 , only to fall agonisingly short in the final with a 13 - 10 defeat			1
now , with @entity22 dramatically out of the running , @entity19 ’s side lock horns with @entity20 in @entity21 on wednesday evening and are aiming to reach their fourth consecutive tournament final			1
big chance : @entity0 ( centre ) believes @entity4 will have to be at their best to beat @entity20 @entity27 : the @entity4 team huddles in training to talk tactics ahead of their @entity14 semi-final against @entity20 on tuesday , after being named in a line - up featuring six starting changes , @entity0 , 34 , recalled the encounter against the @entity35 which @entity4 hope to trump by winning wednesday ’s semi-final and claiming their coveted prize at a sold - out @entity39 on sunday			1
‘ i will always remember the 2010 @entity14 final against @entity22 , ’ she said			1
‘ i can picture standing there at @entity43 , feeling an incredible bond with my team - mates and the supporters in the crowd			1
we faced the @entity49 and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end because the whole stadium erupted into a chant of @entity56			2
‘ it was just a great experience to be with my team - mates that day , trying to achieve something special			1
the result did n’t go the way we wanted , but we ’re in this environment again and hopefully we are ready to do something special this time around			2
’ @entity64 v @entity4 kick - off : 5pm , @entity39 , @entity21			1
@entity66 : live on @entity67 4 and @entity68 the @entity14 has attracted record tv viewing figures and big crowds and , asked if the @entity4 side have sensed heightened interest , @entity0 said : ‘ absolutely			1
having the @entity14 in @entity73 in 2010 really put the foundations in place and grabbed people ’s attention			1
the 2012 @entity78 was great for showcasing women ’s sport and we are riding the wave i guess			2
‘ we are here to bring the trophy home , but if we can do some good for women ’s rugby in @entity85 , in the @entity86 and around the world , raising the profile and showing what a brilliant sport it is , that would be brilliant			1
’ semi-finalists : @entity4 topped their group , @entity93 , with two emphatic wins and a 13 - 13 draw with @entity96 tough test : @entity4 can reach the final of the @entity14 if they beat @entity20 on wednesday a major catalyst for the enhanced interest in the women ’s game was @entity20 ’s feat in condemning @entity22 to a shock pool - stage defeat which ultimately knocked them out of the @entity14			1
@entity4 will be wary of fired - up , familiar foes who beat them last year			1
‘ we know @entity20 quite well and they know us quite well , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i play at @entity10 with @entity108 , their no 7 , and @entity110 , who is a scrum - half			1
a couple of years ago , i also played club rugby with their hooker , @entity114			2
‘ @entity20 came out firing against @entity22 and were massively up for it			1
they had never played them before and rose to the occasion			2
they must n’t be underestimated — we know how strong they can be after they beat us in the @entity118 in 2013			1
‘ they have a very good kicking game so we have to keep our discipline and we know they have a strong driving lineout so we ’ve been doing work to counter that			2
they are a passionate team who will have a lot of strength in the pack			2
we will have to be at our best to win			2
