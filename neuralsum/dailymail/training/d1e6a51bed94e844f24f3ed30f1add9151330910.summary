@entity1 manager @entity0 has said @entity3 counterpart @entity2 has behaved in an unacceptable manner by trying to unsettle his @entity7 @entity6 semi-final defender @entity5			1
@entity5 came through his first pre-season friendly by playing the second 45 minutes in yesterday ’s 0 - 0 draw with @entity10 after taking a break after his impressive tournament displays in @entity14			1
@entity0 is keen to open talks with the 29 - year - old centre - half once the transfer window shuts but has been appalled by @entity2 saying publicly @entity5 ‘ would definitely be an option ’ for @entity3 after selling @entity19 to @entity20			1
hot property : @entity5 ' would definitely be an option ' for @entity3 but @entity1 want him to stay spat : the season has n't even begun and @entity0 is already kicking off with @entity2 @entity2 used to manage @entity5 at @entity7 club @entity25 but @entity0 hit out at his comments saying ; ‘ there is been absolutely no enquiry , not one iota on it			1
the only thing i am disappointed in is people talking about him , who should know better than to talk about other people ’s players			0
‘ i do n’t think you accept it			0
i think out of respect you do n’t do it , you do n’t get involved in that			0
you will have to ask others what they think but i am just giving my opinion			0
’ @entity5 ’s appearance gave @entity1 fans a welcome boost and @entity0 expects him to be at the club come september 1			1
‘ he ’s only been back in training over a week really			0
for him to play against @entity10 was good , he was able to cruise the game so it was n’t too much of a strain for him			0
‘ he ( @entity5 ) had a great @entity6			2
in the games he had , he was excellent , up against quality players in every one of them			0
i am expecting @entity5 to have a good season			2
’ @entity5 only has a year left on his contract but @entity0 hopes formal talks will start soon			1
‘ @entity5 has been really good about it , he ’s never really pushed anything			2
once it settles down , i am pretty sure we will talk			0
’ impressive : @entity5 ( right ) was part of a solid @entity7 defence at the @entity6 and has attracted interest @entity1 need a tight defence this season because on yesterday ’s evidence , they lack firepower going into the new campaign			1
after recent defeats against @entity70 and @entity71 , a dour draw with @entity10 was an improvement with the mean @entity74 marshalled by @entity76 defender @entity75			0
even so , there was little to get @entity1 fans queuing around the block for season tickets with current sales well down on the 28,000 of last season			2
things only livened up at the end when 18 - year - old @entity84 came on and started running the show			1
it was lay - back for @entity87 that produced the best chance in injury - time but @entity87 hit the crossbar from close - range			2
‘ i will be disappointed if he ( @entity95 ) is n’t pushing for a place this season , ’ said @entity0 , once a top midfield player himself			0
extended holiday : @entity5 is only just getting back to work at @entity1 after a @entity6 - enforced break			1

@entity3 boss said @entity5 ' would definitely be an option ' as a signing

he has attracted interest with a *series* of strong displays at the @entity6

but @entity5 **'s** current boss @entity0 is *annoyed* at @entity2 **'s** public interest
the former @entity1 manager is *planning* talks with @entity5 soon
he says @entity2 should have more respect than to publicly court his man
