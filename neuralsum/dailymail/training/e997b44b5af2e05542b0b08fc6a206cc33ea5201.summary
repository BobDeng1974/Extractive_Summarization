@entity1 , 14 , suffered two heart attacks after she vomited so violently that her stomach ruptured			1
gravely ill , she was taken to scandal - hit @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			2
but while a registrar and ambulance staff desperately tried to resuscitate her , two male nurses looked on , apparently ‘ terrified ’ and ‘ overwhelmed ’ by the situation			1
one of the nurses , a coroner was told , tried to use a so - called bone gun the wrong way to connect an intravenous drip			0
instead of pointing the gun at @entity1 ’s leg , he pointed it directly at a doctor			0
there was also a vital delay because a defibrillator was not fully charged , while a subsequent investigation found that the @entity31 team lacked proper leadership			2
the hospital is run by the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , which was recently put into special measures after being identified as one of a number of trusts with an excessive number of patient deaths			0
although the hearing in @entity11 was told that @entity1 ’s treatment did not play a role in her death , the @entity34 has apologised , saying ‘ aspects of care ’ did not meet the ‘ high standards that we normally deliver ’			1
parents @entity48 , 33 , and 34 - year - old @entity0 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , are now considering legal action			0
the inquest on friday also heard that @entity1 ( pictured ) had suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of the mystery illness and little could have been done to save her mother @entity57 ( pictured ) said : ' i am disgusted and angry at the way staff at the hospital treated @entity1			1
some of the staff were told to help with her resuscitation , and they stood by and watched like it was some sort of show ' following the hearing , mrs @entity1 said : ‘ i am disgusted and angry at the way staff at the hospital treated @entity1			2
some of the staff were told to help with her resuscitation , and they stood by and watched like it was some sort of show			0
despite @entity1 's inconsistent care , the coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes ‘ we went to the inquest in the hope we can get closure on our daughter ’s death , but now we have even more questions			1
’ @entity1 was rushed to hospital last october after suffering severe stomach pains on holiday at @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity12 , with a friend and the friend ’s mother			1
by the time an ambulance arrived the teenager was vomiting blood from a ruptured stomach and she died hours later			1
@entity99 , a paramedic who administered cpr at the hospital , told the hearing that two of the resuscitation team – described as possibly of @entity106 origin – failed to get involved			0
one of them , he said , used the bone gun – which allows fluids and medicines to be introduced via bone marrow rather than a vein – in an ‘ alarming manner ’ by attempting to put it in upside down			0
‘ i would describe it as chaos , ’ said mr @entity99			0
‘ in my opinion they appeared overwhelmed by the serious situation			2
’ friday ’s hearing was told @entity1 would not have survived the irreparable stomach @entity124 dr @entity123 said he was ‘ baffled ’ as to what had caused the ruptured stomach			1
@entity12 coroner prof @entity127 , who recorded a verdict of death through natural causes , said : ‘ the treatment she received did not save her life but did not contribute to her death			1
’ the coroner said he would raise some of the issues highlighted at the inquest with the chief executive of the hospital trust			2
@entity34 , which runs @entity10 ( pictured ) , issued a statement apologising for failings in @entity141 s care			0
they said : ' we express our sincere condolences to the family of @entity1 and apologise for any distress caused during her treatment ' @entity34 said that following an investigation , medical staff must now ‘ escalate cases to a consultant when required ’ , while equipment is also checked thoroughly after use			2
in 2011 , the @entity153 ordered trainee nurses out of the @entity10 after serious concerns were raised about the quality of training			0
earlier this year , @entity158 , the @entity34 ’s former chief executive , broke a gagging order to accuse sir @entity160 , the @entity161 chief executive , of ignoring his warnings in 2009 that patient safety was being compromised by the drive to hit government targets .			0

@entity1 suffered two heart attacks after she vomited so violently her stomach ruptured in october last year
she was rushed to @entity10 in *nearby* @entity11 , but died hours later
inquest heard @entity31 staff were ‘ overwhelmed ’ when @entity1 was admitted
this led to a *catalogue* of errors including a situation where a defibrillator could not be used because it was left *unplugged* by staff
verdict of death by natural causes was recorded by the coroner , however
