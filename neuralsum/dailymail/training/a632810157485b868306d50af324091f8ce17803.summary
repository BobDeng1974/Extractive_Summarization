@entity65 vice president @entity64 said : ' if someone is released and they are symptomatic , it could spread rapidly			0
' president @entity69 is under mounting pressure to stem the rising tide of @entity73 and @entity74 migrants flocking across the border in search of better lives			1
last week , @entity79 chairman @entity78 ( @entity80 ) claimed @entity82 military bases are turning into ' refugee camps ' , adding : ' i never thought i 'd see this in the @entity82			2
' too young for the journey : a young girl traveling with @entity74 migrants plays on the freight train they had been riding friday , after it suffered a minor derailment in a remote wooded area outside @entity94 , @entity95 state , @entity7 @entity1 governor @entity96 , also a @entity97 , demanded ‘ secure this border , mr. president ’ in a separate speech			1

swine flu is a relatively new strain of influenza that was responsible for a flu pandemic from 2009 to 2010			0
the virus was first detected in @entity7 in april 2009 , but spread quickly from country to country due to it being a new strain			2
as a result very few people had a natural resistance to the virus			2
it is also known as the @entity10 influenza , denoting the strain of the virus			1
people suffering swine flu typically complain of a fever or high temperature - over @entity131 symptoms include aching muscles , sore throat or a dry cough - symptoms that are very similar to other types of seasonal flu			0

those considered ' at risk ' are pregnant women , people suffering chronic , long - term lung , heart , kidney or liver disease , people suffering conditions including cystic fibrosis and @entity148 's and diabetes			0
many top government officials , including @entity152 minority leader ‘ these children are often subjected to beatings , starvation , sexual assault and are at risk of being trafficked , ’ said @entity78 , according to @entity153			0
‘ allowing them to remain here will only encourage the next group of individuals to undertake this very dangerous , ’ @entity96 added			0
both men ’s remarks came as many border towns have seen an influx of people illegally crossing the @entity82 – @entity7 border only to end up in temporary prisons and makeshift settlements before they are processed and either deported or sent elsewhere			0
a significant number of these immigrants are now unaccompanied minors who end up in lockups like the widely - publicized one at a former bus station in @entity178 , or are found dead in the desert – like a young girl was this week			0
those that do survive the perilous journey are then taken to a @entity184 airport and flown around the country to various shelters , according to @entity187			0
the hub , in a staging area away from the public at the @entity192 … is intended to reduce the amount of time it takes to transfer custody of the minors to the @entity198 , which runs the shelters , the site reported			0
those children , mainly from destitute @entity74 countries , started being taken to military bases across the country last month , according to @entity187			2
some of those bases include @entity203 , in @entity204 , and @entity205 , in @entity1 , according to @entity153			0

president @entity69 earlier this week sought $ 2billion in emergency aid to help open more detention centers across the country to provide ‘ basic humanitarian needs , ’ according to @entity152 press secretary @entity215			1
‘ that 's why the president has asked for additional resources from @entity219 to open up detention facilities across the country , where these individuals can be housed in humane conditions ’ governor @entity96 still blasted the feds after announcing a $ 1.3 million - per - week program to ferry state agents to the border			2
those agents are expected to bolster border patrol efforts , said @entity96 , according to @entity153			1
the governor also called for @entity231 to pay back the $ 500million @entity1 has spent on border security the past 10 years , @entity153 reported			2
not just in @entity1 : the building set aside to house between 600 and 1,200 unaccompanied children , mostly from @entity74 at @entity203 , @entity204 ‘ we have been fulfilling a federal responsibility , ’ said @entity96 , whose own bid to run for president during the 2012 election fizzled out before the @entity97 convention			1
@entity243 chairman @entity242 ( @entity244 ) also called for @entity69 to take a tougher stance on minors crossing the border without their parents ‘ who are already in the @entity82 illegally , ’ he told @entity153			2
he claimed the parents ‘ had a role in smuggling the minors into the @entity82			0
