@entity74 , spokesman for the @entity75 in @entity11 , told the @entity76 that a few hundred fighters from @entity30 , @entity78 and a few members of the @entity26 took part in the the overtake which has seen the base completely destroyed			1

the rebels have set up checkpoints around the base and were able to confiscate 20 different rockets			1
one @entity11 activist said despite the government raids the rebels had taken all the munitions they could from the newly captured base , and he hoped they could find a way to use the missiles against @entity108 's air force			1
' we have asked all countries to help us with anti-aircraft weapons and no one has , so hopefully these will help , ' said the activist , @entity114			2
@entity115 is known about @entity30 , or the @entity116 , which began claiming attacks in @entity35 earlier this year in postings on jihadi forums often used by @entity5			2

the base captured friday is part of the large air defense infrastructure @entity35 has built across the country over the years , mostly for use in a possible war with archenemy @entity163			1
last week , the rebels reported seizing another air defense base outside the capital , @entity168 , as well as a base in the southern province of @entity171			1
online videos shows them torching vehicles and seizing boxes of ammunition in the @entity171 base			0
the storming of such bases by rebels from inside @entity35 embarrasses the @entity108 regime , though it is unclear if the rebels have the know - how to deploy these bases ' weapons			2
nor is it clear if the rebels are holding the bases after storming them			0

by @entity0 and @entity1 intercepted : the @entity8 passenger plane that was forced by @entity220 jets to land in @entity221 on wednesday the interception of a passenger plane allegedly carrying military gear from @entity225 to @entity168 is a sign of @entity220 's mounting frustration at the drawn - out conflict and its inability to hasten regime change in @entity35 , according to analysts			2
recent cross-border shelling from @entity35 that killed five @entity220 civilians near the countries ' 566 - mile common frontier may have forced @entity220 to act , but its options were limited			0
‘ there 's nothing magical about the timing			0
it 's a coincidence resulting from the build - up of frustration in @entity221 , ’ said @entity237 , a @entity220 analyst at the @entity238 think tank in @entity240			0
‘ @entity220 wants to hasten the demise of the @entity108 regime in @entity168 , but really its hands are tied			0
’ @entity220 prime minister @entity249 has been at the forefront of international efforts to put pressure on the @entity108 regime and end its 19 - month crackdown on the opposition			0
last year , @entity221 began allowing members of the rebel @entity26 to operate in @entity220 and now @entity35 's civil war has reached a stalemate			0
‘ given the current international impasse over the conflict in @entity35 , practical measures such as the interception of aircraft will become increasingly important for states seeking to restrict @entity8 government forces ' access to military - related goods from external sources , ’ said @entity260 , a researcher with the @entity261			1
@entity220 fighter jets on wednesday intercepted the @entity8 air plane they said was carrying @entity275 ammunition and military equipment destined for the @entity277			1
@entity35 branded the incident piracy and @entity275 said the action endangered the lives of @entity275 citizens aboard the aircraft			0
@entity275 has been one of @entity35 's main weapons suppliers , and it has also been shielding the regime of @entity8 president @entity108 from @entity288 sanctions			1
@entity289 , an analyst with the @entity221 - based @entity290 , said that it was not yet clear whether the decision to force down the @entity225 to @entity168 plane was part of a larger drive to change the dynamic of the war			0
‘ if it is acting with its allies , it 's a clear message to @entity275 to get out of the picture and stop arming @entity35 , ’ he added			0
‘ it is such a bold move , that one wonders if @entity220 acted alone			0
’ @entity304 spokeswoman @entity303 declined thursday to comment on @entity220 media reports that the intelligence on the plane 's contents had come from the @entity144			0
but she told reporters that @entity310 backed @entity220 's decision to intercept the plane			0
‘ any transfer of any military equipment to the @entity8 regime at this time is very concerning , and we look forward to hearing more from the @entity220 side when they get to the bottom of what they found , ’ said @entity303			2
the exact contents of the cargo are still unclear : @entity220 's prime minister described it as ‘ ammunition , ’ while @entity326 , a newspaper close to the @entity220 government , reported friday that the cargo contained 12 pieces of missile parts and ‘ trigger devices ’ and that intelligence received was that it could be used by @entity35 against @entity220			2
the respected @entity275 daily @entity334 quoted an unidentified source as saying there were 12 boxes of spare parts for radars of the @entity8 missile defense units			2
‘ if the @entity334 report is right , you could speculate about this being part of a build - up to imposing a no - fly zone , ’ said @entity341 , who leads the @entity220 program for the @entity343			0
such a move could be the first step toward lending @entity35 's rebels the same kind of international air support that helped bring down @entity355 's @entity354 last year			2
but most analysts see no push — either in @entity220 or among its @entity359 allies — for outside military involvement in @entity35 .			0

@entity8 rebels were joined by extremist group @entity30 in the attack last night
the rebels overtook an air defence base near the village of @entity34 , east of @entity11
a spokesman for the @entity75 in @entity11 said government raids on friday morning had destroyed much of the rockets at the base
rebels now fear extremists are taking advantage of the lack of organisation to gather weapons for their own cause
