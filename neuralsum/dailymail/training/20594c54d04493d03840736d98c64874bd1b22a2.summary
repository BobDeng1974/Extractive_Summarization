by @entity0 for @entity1 whether you listen in on a teenager or tune into the @entity6 , there 's no denying that ' uptalking ' has well and truly cemented itself in mainstream @entity10 speech			0
but while tv shows such as @entity13 and @entity14 have been blamed for the popularity of the speaking style , one scientist claims that the people to blame are , in fact , the @entity18			2
@entity20 is a speech trait that involves raising the voice 's pitch at the end of a sentence , even if it 's not a question			1
@entity27 , professor of linguistics believes uptalk spread from the west coast of @entity31 and @entity32 , the two areas plundered the worst by the @entity18 , to other cities in the north @entity35 described uptalk as the ‘ language of the @entity39 generation ’ and said he ‘ barely knows anyone under 20 who does n’t use it ’			1
however , far from being a new development , uptalk has in fact been part of many @entity47 dialects for centuries , according to a report by @entity50 in @entity51			2
for instance , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 accents often use a rising intonation at the end of their statements			1
@entity27 , professor of linguistics at the @entity61 in @entity62 , claims there is a strong link between the areas plundered by the @entity18 in the 9th century , and the regions that use uptalk			1
while tv shows such as @entity13 ( pictured ) and @entity14 have been thought to contribute to the trend of uptalk , scientists claim the people to blame are the vikings ' i have observed that the original distribution of these populations , ' he said in a recent report			2
' they were areas of intense raiding and settlement by @entity83 vikings in the early 9th century			1
' recent genetic evidence suggests in fact that strong connections between these populations largely antedates the @entity89 raids			0
' for instance , @entity90 @entity83 is one of the last languages in the world to keep rising intonation in statements			2
professor @entity27 believes this trend spread from the west coast of @entity31 and @entity32 to other cities in the @entity101			1
these were the two areas plundered the worst by the @entity18			1
@entity27 , professor of linguistics at the @entity61 in @entity62 , claims there is a strong link between the areas plundered by the @entity89 in the 9th century , and the regions that use uptalk there is , however , he says , a key difference between how the characters in @entity13 uses uptalk and its use in regional dialects			1
' when a man from @entity55 tells you , " i 'm going to smash your face in " and his voice rises , he 's being assertive , ' professor @entity27 told the @entity51			1
' but @entity120 uptalk is the opposite			0
' there has been a backlash against the trend of uptalk when it is n't part of a regional dialect , according to recent reports			1
a recent survey of 700 company bosses by publisher @entity132 found upspeak could kill off the possibility of a promotion or a pay rise			0
an overwhelming majority of bosses – 71 per cent – said it was a ‘ particularly annoying trait ’ , while 85 per cent witheringly added that it is a ‘ clear indicator of a person ’s insecurity or emotional weakness ’			0
more than half said it could damage an employee ’s professional credibility by revealing an inability or reluctance to speak their mind			0
@entity20 is often associated with @entity14 lead character @entity150 ( pictured ) first men became enamoured with grooming regimes , but now it seems the metrosexual man has started talking in a more feminine way too			2
a new study has revealed that modern men are starting to ‘ uptalk ’ by rising in pitch at the ends of sentences			2
scientists came across the finding when they were trying to investigate the difference between uptalkers making a statement and asking a question			0
uptalkers are stereotypically parodied as insecure , shallow and not very clever females			0
however , scientists from the @entity171 , who recorded the voices of 24 young southern @entity174 , found that the 12 men they studied also uptalked and the speakers came from different backgrounds - not just mansions in @entity179			0
they were given several speech tasks , such as providing directions from a map , or recounting what happened after watching a clip from a popular sitcom			0
‘ we found use of uptalk in all of our speakers , despite their diverse backgrounds in socio - economic status , ethnicity , bilingualism and gender , ’ study leader dr @entity186 , a linguist at the university said .			0

@entity20 is the *widespread* habit of raising pitch at the end of a sentence
but it is n't a new trend . @entity206 , @entity54 and @entity55 accents use uptalk
@entity27 , a professor of linguistics , says there is a link between areas plundered by @entity18 in the 9th century , and regions that raise intonation
