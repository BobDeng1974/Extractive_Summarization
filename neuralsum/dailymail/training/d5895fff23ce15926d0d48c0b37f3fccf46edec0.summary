by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 28 may 2013 the bank holiday weekend may have been awash with glorious sunshine , but the rest of the half term looks like its going to be more of a wash out			1
much of @entity6 has been hit with torrential downpours today , dampening the spirits of those going back to work after enjoying the bank holiday sun and delaying the start of the last day of the second test at @entity14 between @entity15 and @entity16			1
and for those who were looking forward to a sunny half term , the outlook does not look great , with forecasters predicting showers and longer spells of rain for large parts of the country throughout the week			1
he said : ' it 's looking fairly cloudy and wet today and also quite a few degrees colder than it has been over the bank holiday weekend , so in general it is much more unsettled today with rain for many areas			1
' it is probably central and southern @entity15 and parts of the @entity56 which have seen the most rain			1
' looking ahead at the rest of the day , it 's quite windy across the @entity56 and the south which could see a further ten to 15mms of rain			2
' it 's not quite so wet elsewhere , i think northern @entity64 and @entity65 are getting away with a mostly dry day today and in terms of sunshine , it 's probably quite bright up there as well			2
' the @entity69 however has predicted a further 20mm of rain could fall in the @entity56 and parts of @entity73 , while @entity74 , @entity75 and the north east of @entity15 could see up to 25mm of rain tonight			1
grey skies and heavy rain dampens the spirits after the sunny bank holiday weekend in @entity40 the worst of the weather has been over central and southern parts of @entity15			1

mr @entity41 said : ' tomorrow is a fairly similar prospect with more rain in places			0
the actual position of the rain is fairly uncertain at the moment , but in general it looks like eastern areas will be having the heaviest of the rain			0
' yet again , north west @entity64 and northern @entity65 are looking mostly dry			0
' there could also be the odd rumble of thunder in among any of the heavy showers			0
showers are expected for much of the half term this week , although forecasters are hoping things will clear up a little by the end of the week large parts of @entity6 have been hit with torrential downpours this morning and forecasters are predicting rain for much of this week 's half term a man walks in the rain on @entity39 ( left ) while two men in suits take cover from the rain in @entity85 , central @entity40 , ( right ) this afternoon a couple wear @entity144 flag decorated waterproofs during a rainstorm near @entity147 in @entity40 looking further ahead , thursday is looking like it is going to be a brighter day with scattered showers for @entity15 and @entity73			1
again , @entity64 and @entity65 look like they will stay quite dry			0
mr @entity41 said : ' it looks quite promising towards the end of the week that most of the @entity6 will be dry on friday so , fingers - crossed , that will lead into a fairly decent weekend			1
' meanwhile , scientists at the @entity156 have said one of the most eagerly awaited visitors to the @entity6 shores may have been deterred by the long , chilly spring			2
the scientists have said they have barely had any sightings of basking sharks so far in 2013 , in contrast to a bumper crop last year			0
a couple , armed with umbrellas , walk along @entity167 's promenade in the rain today a car drives through a large puddle which has built up in a road in @entity167 , @entity172 umbrellas are the order of the day as the rain falls in @entity167 the covers are on at @entity177 , in @entity178 , which is likely to delay the final day 's play in the second test cricket match between @entity15 and @entity16 @entity181 , the organisation â€™s senior bio- diversity officer , said he believed it was because the water temperature is lower than usual for the time of year			2
despite the fact that the gentle giants of the sea can grow to the size of a double decker bus , they are still prone to feel the cold and even a few degrees can make a difference to their habits , he said			0
' divers are telling us that the water temperature is 10 or 11 degrees centigrade			0
but at this time of the year it should be nearer 13 degrees , ' said dr @entity181			0
' this means that the plankton , which is the basking sharks favourite food and the reason they come to our waters , are not blooming in the usual quantities so basking sharks are staying in warmer seas to feed			0
' after a six year wait , @entity6 's longest wisteria has finally burst into bloom			2
it took fifteen years to train the vine to grow along the full length of a giant garden wall in @entity217 @entity218 admires the giant wisteria near @entity220 in @entity217			0
