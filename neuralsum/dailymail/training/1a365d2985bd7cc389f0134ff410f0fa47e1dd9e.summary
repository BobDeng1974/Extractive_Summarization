a nine - year - old boy has been given a new pair of ears – made from his ribs			1
@entity4 was teased at school after being born deaf and with nothing but small lobes where his ears should have been			1
he ‘ always wanted big ears ’ and now surgeons at @entity11 have granted his wish			1
on seeing the result in a ‘ side - selfie ’ - a photograph of the side of his head that his parents helped him take - all he could say was ‘ wow ’			2
@entity4 ’s father , @entity36 , said : ‘ we ’re absolutely on cloud nine			0
we could not have wished for a better result			0
impressed : on seeing the result in a ' side - selfie ' - a photograph of the side of his head that his parents helped him take - all he could say was ' wow ' ‘ they look like normal ears , he had nothing but has got proper sized ears now and they cover the gap where ears should have been			1
they look normal bar a couple of sewing marks which will go away in time			0
‘ his reaction was just a “ wow ” , he is very happy			0
; @entity4 , of @entity58 , in @entity59 , was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia in which the ears are missing or deformed			1
unusually , both of his ears were affected			2
he was teased at school and found that other children were more interested in asking about his looks than making friends			0
his parents said he wanted to look like everyone and before last tuesday ’s ( aug 5th ) operation , he said : ‘ i ’ve always wanted big ears and now i ’m finally going to have them ’			1
during the op , plastic and reconstructive surgeon @entity77 , took rib cartilage from both sides of @entity4 ’s chest and then carved and shaped it into frameworks for @entity4 ’s ears			2
rare : @entity4 , of @entity58 , ( pictured with his father @entity84 ) in @entity59 , was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia in which the ears are missing or deformed thrilled : @entity4 ( centre ) with his father @entity84 , mother @entity91 and sister @entity92			1
@entity4 is very happy with the results of his operation an outline of mrs @entity97 ’s ears served as a template			2
the surgeon then grafted the ears onto @entity4 ’s head under pockets of skin and then used a vacuum to shape the skin to over the contours			0
doing both ears at the same time helped ensure they were a match			0
‘ this allows us to ensure the ears are balanced and achieve the best result ‘ it ’s a major operation but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia			2
their confidence improves exponentially and their performance at school improves			0
‘ if you can improve a young person ’s confidence , you can alter their whole trajectory in life			0
’ mr @entity4 , a 44 - year - old it manager said : ‘ it ’s been heart - wrenching for us and we ’ve had the moral dilemma all along of whether it ’s right to change the features that @entity4 was born with			1
‘ but @entity4 has talked about having ear surgery ever since the age of six when he saw a tv programme about it			0
’ the operation was largely cosmetic			0
however , thanks to previous surgery and a hearing aid , @entity4 can ‘ hear the wind blow and the birds tweet ’			1
he should be able to go back to school after the holidays and bar one follow - up operation in the winter , he should not need any more surgery			2
up to 40 children a year are given new ears at @entity11 , although only five or so will need both ears replaced .			1

@entity14 was born with bilateral microtia which affected both ears
nine - year - old was deaf and had small lobes where his ears should have been
surgeons at @entity11 grant wish for ' big ears '
cartilage from ribs sculpted into ears *modelled* on @entity14 **'s** mother **'s**
further surgery means he can ' hear the wind blow and the birds tweet '
