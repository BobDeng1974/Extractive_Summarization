the first official pictures of @entity26 were taken at @entity48 and @entity13 ’s cottage on princess @entity52 ’s @entity51 estate in @entity53 and come just days after their publicist denied they were planning to make money out of the birth			2
intriguingly , the @entity19 has learnt the deal was brokered late last week by the @entity63 medal - winning equestrian ’s management company , sports and @entity65 , whose managing director is none other than @entity3 ’s brother @entity28			2

@entity3 is very close to her grandmother , so of course she made a phone call once we got back home			0

" ' @entity26 's second cousin @entity108 was born at the private @entity114 of @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117 the interview was brokered by @entity119 , an @entity120 firm dealing in sponsorship and client management			1
its small @entity117 office was set up in 2012 by @entity28			0
like her brother , @entity3 has no royal title or taxpayer funding			0
she earns a living as a professional equestrian , funding her stables through sponsorship deals with firms including @entity132 and @entity133			0
last night a source close to @entity3 insisted she and @entity13 had agreed to the deal as ‘ international sporting figures ’ rather than members of the @entity5			2
they said : ‘ it [ the magazine deal ] was not , initially , something they intended to do			0
the pictures had already been taken by an old schoolfriend of @entity3 when they were approached by @entity17 ! and agreed to sign a deal			2
it was all very sudden			0
‘ i think @entity3 understands there will be a level of criticism directed at her but she clearly felt this was the best way to approach the level of interest in @entity26 and , of course , provide for her future			0
’ but lawyer @entity157 , head of intellectual property and media and entertainment at @entity161 , warned : ‘ this is going to make it very difficult for them to protect the privacy of their baby when she is photographed in the future , outside of any specific issue of harassment			0
’ this is not the first time @entity3 or her family have struck a deal with @entity17 ! : cover stars : @entity3 features on the cover of @entity17 ! magazine in 2011 ( left ) and with her ex-boyfriend in 2002 ( right ) familiar faces : @entity3 's father is pictured on the front of the magazine in 1997 ( left ) and her brother in 2008 ( right )			1
