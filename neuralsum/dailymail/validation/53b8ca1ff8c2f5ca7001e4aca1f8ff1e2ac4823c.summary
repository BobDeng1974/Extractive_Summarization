@entity1 's final words to his @entity3 players will be very simple before they step out at @entity4 on sunday : ' good luck			1
' the @entity3 boss knows the odds for the @entity9 quarter - final are heavily weighted in their opponents ' favour , and would have been before @entity13 hit the run of form that has seen them win nine of their last 11 @entity18 games			1
' it 's @entity20 , ' said @entity1			2
@entity1 knows the odds are against @entity3 ahead of their @entity9 clash against @entity13 @entity22 hit his 13th of the campaign to help @entity3 to their first away win since october ' nobody 's giving us a chance outside of our dressing room			1
' i think they 're the most impressive team in the @entity18 at the moment and the football that they 're playing is fantastic			1
obviously full credit to the manager for the way he changed his formation			0
' we 've studied the videos , we 've come up with a gameplan , and we 've worked with the players on it			0

' we 've been very organised and very disciplined in the previous meetings with the @entity18 teams , and then of course along the way you need a bit of luck			2

the lads have earned the right to play at @entity4 with the performances in the previous rounds			0
' @entity1 said his team will go into the match high on confidence , and they can certainly take great encouragement from their performances in the last two rounds			1
neither @entity67 nor @entity68 enjoyed their visits to @entity70 , with @entity3 racking up seven goals across the fourth and fifth rounds			1
although @entity4 presents a major step up , it is a ground that holds the most special of memories for @entity3			2

but we want it to continue			0
' for the supporters it 's going to be a great day out			0
they 're going to bask in the memory of 20 years ago			0
i think there 's something planned in the 20th minute , which is going to be really good , but the players are going to do a job			0
' @entity114 scores for @entity3 during his side 's memorable 4 - 1 victory against @entity68 in february @entity117 is back in training with @entity13 but he wo n't walk straight back into the team @entity1 is also taking pride in earning positive headlines for @entity3 after the most turbulent of times			1
rovers became a club at war with itself following the takeover in 2010 by @entity127 's and less than two years later they were relegated from the top flight			0
they had got through three managers in a season and were heading towards another relegation when @entity1 , who joined @entity3 's backroom staff in 2004 , began another stint as caretaker manager in march 2013			1
@entity136 has scored twice in a week for an in - form @entity13 side @entity1 believes @entity139 ' side are the ' most impressive ' in the @entity18 at the moment his reward for stabilising the club was to be given a chance as permanent boss , and two years later @entity3 are finally a football story again			1
