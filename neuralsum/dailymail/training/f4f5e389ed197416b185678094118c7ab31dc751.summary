grieving parents have revealed how their miscarriages and stillbirths have been handled insensitively and callously by the @entity3			2
many were horrified to be told that the remains of their dead babies would be incinerated with other medical waste			1
@entity8 , 35 , whose first pregnancy failed when she was 13 weeks along , was one of the victims			1
insensitive : @entity8 was told her miscarried baby would be disposed of with the rest of the day 's waste , left , while @entity17 's , right , baby 's remains were whisked off and incinerated before she was consulted she said : ' we went for routine scan and i was really excited			1
but i was told " i 'm really sorry your baby 's heart stopped beating when you were eight weeks pregnant			1
" ' unbeknown to me i 'd had a dead baby inside me for five weeks			1
i was hysterical and crying			0
a nurse talked us through our options which was to let things happen naturally at home or have what 's called a " medical management of miscarriage			1
" @entity8 said they opted for the latter but their ordeal was compounded by how they were then treated			1
' i asked one of the nurses what would happen to my baby and she said " it will be incinerated with the rest of the day 's waste			1
' that was difficult to hear , to me it was n't the day 's waste , it was my baby			1
it would have been nice to mark that baby 's life but there was nothing in the hospital that gave us that opportunity			1
' @entity8 , who went on to have a healthy son , shares her story with @entity58 for tonight 's edition of dispatches on @entity61			1
ordeal : grieving mothers share their stories with @entity58 on this evening 's dispatches the @entity68 's @entity67 judge has suffered from numerous heartache herself in her quest to be a mother			1
she now has daughters @entity73 and @entity74 with husband @entity75			0
but in 2010 she had a miscarriage and in 2011 , she had a stillborn son			0
then when she gave birth to her second daughter , she nearly died after her heart stopped beating but was resuscitated by a midwife			0
@entity58 said she received " amazing " treatment and support from the @entity3 so she was shocked to hear of the suffering of other parents			0
@entity17 revealed how she was mistreated when she was rushed hospital in pain when seven weeks pregnant			1
she explained : ' i had to do urine sample and the baby passed when i went to the toilet			2
a nurse came and grabbed the pot and ran off with it			0
' i was distressed wondering what she had done with my baby			2
i was then told it had been incinerated			1
i felt like my baby had been stolen from me , i had no rights over what happened			2
' loss : @entity101 buried her stillborn son @entity102 at @entity104 cemetery @entity103 misled : when @entity101 buried her son she thought this plot on the right would be his indefinitely however , she returned find his grave had been dismantled and there was another baby in the same plot incineration of fetal remains is banned in @entity116 but there are only guidelines for rest of @entity68 stating remains should be handled ' sensitively '			1
dispatches discovered that 27 trusts incinerate remains , sometimes with the parents oblivious to the fact their babies are being disposed of along with other medical waste such as syringes and swabs			1
one hospital , @entity130 , in @entity131 is even heated by burning clinical waste including miscarried babies			2
@entity136 , from the @entity137 : ' that 's appalling , it should not take place in this day and age			2
hopefully we will ban incineration of fetal remains in the near future			2
' as reported earlier in the @entity145 , last night health minister @entity144 stepped in to order an immediate ban on incinerating fetal remains head of the documentary airing this evening			2
@entity58 praised her own experience of the @entity3 but was shocked to hear others had been less fortunate ' this practice is totally unacceptable , ' he said			0
' that is why i have asked professor sir @entity156 , @entity3 medical director , to write to all @entity3 hospital trusts , to make it clear that it must stop now			2
' the chief medical officer has also written to the @entity161 to ask them to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue			0
' while the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way , that must be the case for all hospitals and the @entity161 has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay			0
' dispatches also reveals that other parents have suffered due to the way burials of their deceased babies have been handled			0
@entity101 buried her stillborn son @entity102 at @entity104 cemetery @entity103			0
she said she discussed plans with her local hospital trust and funeral directors and then created a memorial where her son was buried with a small fence , stones and flowers			0
she later returned to find it been dismantled and was horrified to find a new baby 's grave in its place			1
both she and the parents of that baby were devastated to think their baby did not have a grave of their own or any lasting memorial			0
when they complained , they were told the procedure had been explained previously but they probably were n't in the the " right frame of mind " to take it in			2
but @entity101 said : ' i would have remembered if they 've told me six other babies would be buried with mine			0
' the @entity3 trust involved blamed the funeral directors and council who operate the cemetery for not fully explaining the situation to the bereaved parents			0
@entity213 , who handed the burial , said all babies are buried individually in their own plots but permanent plots are not permitted in baby section			0
they added : ' we are truly sorry if this was not explained clearly enough , and we are working to improve information			0
' @entity222 who operate the cemetery added : ' items were removed from her baby 's grave to facilitate the burial of another baby in the adjacent space			1
this is normal practice and all the items were neatly left in a bag by the grave			0
' dispatches : @entity237 is on @entity61 tonight at 8pm .			0

@entity8 , 35 , lost her baby when 8 weeks pregnant
was told remains would be ' incinerated with the day 's waste '
this meant it would be burnt with medical *rubbish* such as syringes
grieving mother said she was n't able to mark lost baby 's life
