a @entity1 coffee company has been forced to withdraw novelty milk lids featuring the image of @entity5 dictator @entity4 after they were spotted by @entity7 businessmen in a city centre cafe			1
lids showing the faces of @entity4 and @entity11 were spotted by a group @entity7 while having a coffee break in a cafe in the city of @entity16 , in the eastern @entity1 region of @entity18			1
the plastic take - away packaging showing the fascist dictators ' portraits inside a gold frame were distributed by @entity1 's largest supermarket chain @entity23			1
coffee cream lids featuring @entity4 and @entity11 caused outrage after being handed out in a cafe in @entity1 @entity27 , 47 , from @entity7 , who was on a business trip in @entity1 said : ' our @entity1 colleagues took us down to the coffee shop and when the waitress brought them over we saw the face of @entity4 staring up at us from one of the cream containers			1
' i could n't believe it and at first thought it was some sort of sick joke being played by my colleagues			0
' but then we saw the other containers also had the face of @entity4 on and some had @entity11			0
' this is just absolutely evil and outrageous			0
' the cream lids were also found at a takeaway food kiosk in @entity1 's northern @entity46			1
shocked customers complained in droves after being handed them with their takeaway coffees			0
kiosk owner @entity50 , 33 , said : ' to be honest , i had n't even looked at them so when people started complaining i was n't sure what they were talking about			0
' but then i looked and , yes , was pretty shocked too			0
' it seems like a very bizarre and distasteful piece of marketing			0
' in @entity1 , labels from the mini-cream containers are collectibles , and producers often seek new and inventive ways to enhance their appeal			1
@entity64 , a spokesman for @entity23 , said the mishap had occurred when an outside company asked @entity67 , a dairy manufacturer and @entity23 subsidiary , to supply a series of 55 coffee cream containers based on vintage cigar labels , two of which featured the dictators			1
he said that the outside company had provided the controversial designs , and that @entity67 typically produced plastic creamers with charming and innocuous images on them - not fascists			2
he said : ' i ca n't tell you how these labels got past our controls			2
usually the labels have pleasant images like trains , landscapes and dogs - nothing polemic that can pose a problem			2
' @entity1 has in the past been forced to grapple with its relationship with the @entity91 during @entity92 , including accusations that @entity1 banks abetted the @entity96 regime			1
but @entity64 emphasised that the accidental circulation of the plastic @entity4 creamers had nothing to do with the country 's social mores , but rather reflected an isolated mistake			0
speaking about his company 's cream pots , @entity64 said : ' whoever made this mistake was not thinking properly as these are n't meant to be images for a book about @entity92 , but rather something meant to be enjoyed with coffee and a chocolate cake			2
confirming that the sale and distribution of the product has been stopped , he added : ' you can not put @entity116 or a terrorist on a milk creamer			0
