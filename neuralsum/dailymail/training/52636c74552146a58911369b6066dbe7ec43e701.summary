several former intelligence officials are accusing the @entity1 of failing to act in the case of a @entity4 doctor who faces 33 years behind bars despite leading the @entity6 to @entity7			1
outcry has erupted against the @entity10 administration since dr @entity12 's sentence on tuesday , which was seen as punishment for humiliating @entity14 for apparently not knowing the @entity16 leader was living comfortably within its boundaries			1
dr @entity12 was arrested days after the @entity21 raid on @entity7 ’s compound			1
treason : dr @entity12 , left , was jailed for 33 years in @entity24 for helping the @entity6 find @entity7 , a move that was seen as a major humiliation for the country @entity28 , a former intelligence analyst and adviser , said the @entity6 should have had a plan in place to get him out of @entity14 before his arrest			1
mr @entity28 told @entity33 : ' you probably would n't want to have tipped him off ahead of time , but maybe the day right afterward you would have wanted to have helped him leave @entity14 - and the same with anybody else who was working with us			2
' while the @entity39 claims it is in talks with @entity14 in the @entity12 case , another ex-intelligence official says they ’re not doing enough , if anything			2
lt. col. @entity44 told @entity33 : ' from what i 'm hearing , we did pretty much nothing			0
' accusations : @entity28 , left , and lt col @entity44 , right , say the @entity1 has not done enough to secure dr @entity12 's freedom ' we did nothing diplomatically at all , did n't raise a finger			1
... from what my sources tell me , we did nothing to try and help this guy			0
' on wednesday , rep @entity60 , the @entity62 congressman who leads the @entity63 , pointed to the @entity1 for ' outing ' dr @entity12 to @entity14 authorities			1
' they put him out there , ' mr @entity60 said in light of the doctor 's prison sentence for treason by the @entity14 government			1
' this has been handled very poorly right from the time of the raid , ' mr @entity60 told @entity33			0
' they disclosed his identity			0
' pointing the finger : representative @entity60 says that the @entity10 administration revealed the doctor 's identity , effectively leading the @entity14 authorities to him the sentence is viewed by @entity85 officials as punishment for humiliating the nation which claimed not to know it was harbouring the @entity16 leader			1
meanwhile , a @entity91 panel expressed its outrage thursday over @entity14 's conviction of dr @entity12 by cutting aid to @entity24 by $ 33million - $ 1million for every year of the physician 's 33 - year sentence for high treason			1
the punitive move came on top of deep reductions the @entity102 already had made to president @entity10 's budget request for @entity14 , a reflection of the growing congressional anger over its cooperation in combatting terrorism			2
the overall foreign aid budget for next year had slashed more than half of the proposed assistance and threatened further reductions if @entity24 failed to open overland supply routes to @entity6 - led @entity114 forces in @entity115			2
pushing aside any diplomatic talk , @entity116 and @entity117 criticised @entity14 a day after dr @entity12 ’s conviction			2
the doctor ran a vaccination program for the @entity122 to collect dna and verify @entity7 's presence at the compound in @entity126 where @entity6 commandos found and killed the @entity16 leader in may 2011			1
the @entity6 has called for dr @entity12 's release , arguing that he was acting in the interest of the @entity6 and @entity14			1
' we need @entity14 , @entity14 needs us , but we do n't need @entity14 double - dealing and not seeing the justice in bringing @entity7 to an end , ' said @entity134 , a @entity116 from @entity135 , who pushed for the additional cut in aid			2
he accused @entity14 of ' schizophrenic ally ' helping the @entity6 at one turn , but then aiding the @entity140 which has claimed responsibility for several attacks on @entity6			0
the group also has ties to @entity16 and the @entity145			0
' it 's @entity147 at best , ' said @entity149 @entity148 of @entity150			0
' if this is cooperation , i 'd hate like hell to see opposition			0
' mission : the @entity16 leader was killed at this compound in @entity126 by @entity157 one of the most forceful statements came from @entity159 of @entity160 , who also serves as the chairwoman of the @entity162			0
she pointed out that @entity14 has suffered at the hands of terrorists yet misconstrued what is treason in convicting @entity12			2
she also insisted that @entity12 was not a spy			0
' this conviction says to me that @entity16 is viewed by the court to be @entity14 , ' said @entity159 , who said it made her rethink @entity6 assistance			0
the committee approved @entity178 's amendment to cut the assistance by $ 33million on a 30 - 0 @entity180 crafting the overall legislation , the committee reduced @entity10 's request to aid @entity14 by 58 per cent as resentment and doubts linger on @entity185 , a year after @entity7 was killed deep inside @entity14			1
tensions between @entity187 and @entity24 have increased as @entity14 closed overland supply routes to @entity115 after a @entity6 attack on the @entity14 side of the border killed 24 @entity14 soldiers in november			0
dr @entity12 helped the @entity122 by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the dna of @entity7 ’s children from the family compound in @entity126			1
tense : the moment president @entity10 and his team watched the mission to find and kill @entity7 in the @entity200 of the @entity1 on may 1 , 2011 sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by @entity21 last may			1
it sparked a major rift between the @entity6 and @entity14 leaders who were embarrassed that @entity7 had been living in a major military hub close to the capital			2
a furious @entity14 felt the covert operation was a violation of its sovereignty and implied the @entity6 was unable to trust its key partner in the war on terror			0
dr @entity12 was arrested shortly after the @entity7 raid , for conspiring against the state of @entity14 , his house was sealed and all assets frozen			1
a commission recommended a charge of conspiracy against @entity14 and high treason			0
@entity6 defence secretary @entity225 confirmed in january that dr @entity12 collected dna in an effort to help locate @entity7 but added he ' was not in any way treasonous towards @entity14			1
for them to take this kind of action against somebody who was helping to go after terrorism is a real mistake			0
' dr @entity12 had no right to legal representation , to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses			2
he must also pay a $ 3,600 fine or serve a further three - and - a - half years in jail			0
@entity6 secretary of state @entity239 has called for his release			0

dr @entity12 led @entity21 to @entity7 by setting up fake vaccination programme that allowed him to take dna samples from terrorist 's children
ex-intelligence officials say @entity1 did n't do enough to secure dr @entity12 's freedom
@entity85 officials say sentencing in @entity24 is punishment for humiliating @entity14 , who claims to not know @entity16 boss was living in @entity126
rep @entity60 says that @entity10 administration identified the doctor to @entity14 government officials , prompting his 33 - year treason sentence
