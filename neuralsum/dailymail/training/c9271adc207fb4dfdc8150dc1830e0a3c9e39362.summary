by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 22:02 est , 25 march 2013 @entity3 : 14:27 est , 31 december 2013 made for tv : the move to use the @entity6 as a way to buy private property and turn it into national parks was a plotline in @entity11 a @entity13 member of @entity14 slammed the @entity16 administration monday for creating five new national monuments when the @entity1 federal government is struggling under the weight of a mandated austerity plan			1
when the so - called budget sequester , a trigger mechanism built into the failed 2012 congressional budget talks , kicked in , most federal agencies were forced into across - the - board budget cuts			1
this includes the @entity27 , whose @entity28 maintains and operates national parks and monuments			2
the @entity16 administration has cited the sequester - based austerity program in closing the @entity33 to public tours , a move that @entity13 have called needless and silly			1
but the president created five new monuments monday in a signing ceremony announced just four days earlier			0
' by designating these national monuments today , we will ensure they will continue to inspire and be enjoyed by generations of @entity1 to come , ' he said			0
the @entity33 emphasized that the new designations ' were made with bi-partisan support from congressional , state and local officials , local businesses and other stakeholders and are expected to promote economic growth			1
' but @entity50 , a congressman from the state of @entity52 who chairs the powerful @entity53 , lashed out , countering that it was wrong to create new government expenditures while the administration was already creating controversy with cuts to constituent services			1
making moves : the president created the @entity62 in @entity63 , as one of five national monuments he created using the obscure law ' president @entity16 has closed the @entity33 to public tours but he 's unilaterally ordering the @entity28 to spend scarce dollars on little - known , privately owned property in @entity70 , ' @entity50 said			1
vice president @entity71 will travel to that @entity70 site on tuesday , along with secretary of the interior @entity73 and senator @entity75			0
the newly designated @entity76 is in @entity77 , @entity70			0
officials from the @entity27 insisted monday that the cost of operating five new national monuments would be small			0
one official told @entity82 that compared to the department 's $ 12.2 billion overall budget , ' a couple million - probably tens of millions - does n't seem like much			2
' crying foul : congressman @entity50 says that the decision will cost too much money and only help five states @entity50 also sniped that @entity16 was abusing the @entity6 , a 1906 law intended to give presidents the power to save historically significant sites from destruction			1
the president , he said , was ' dictat [ ing ] under a century - old law that the government spend money it does n’t have on property it does n’t even own ' and ' acting on simple whim			2
' ' no imminent threat of destruction or harm is posed at any of these five locations , ' he said			0
' especially troubling are the inclusion of private property in these new monuments and the lack of transparency that surrounds monument designations where the @entity33 and president work in secret and are able to thwart public review , public comment and consideration of environmental and economic impacts			1
' @entity119 ' concerns about the @entity6 drew parallels to an episode of the popular tv drama @entity11			1
in an episode during the now - defunct show 's eighth season , the fictional @entity124 president @entity123 used the law to turn a contested piece of land into a national park			0
taking cues ? the move was the plotline of a former @entity11 episode where fictional president @entity123 ( right ) did the same thing in the storyline , @entity13 holding up a banking reform law agreed to drop their objections if federal lands in @entity142 were opened to commercial strip mining			2
@entity123 agreed , but double - crossed them by using the @entity6 to put the land out of reach - after he signed the banking bill into law			1
in the real @entity33 principal @entity33 deputy press secretary @entity147 fielded questions from reporters monday , saying that ' these kinds of designations are important both for , in some cases , for the local economy in these communities			2
... you can see local economies growing up around the designation of these properties that as visitors come to enjoy these new national monuments that will have a stimulative impact on the local economies			0
' @entity147 also said that ' a lot of the land for these new national monuments was either land that was already owned by the federal government or it was donated			0
and in terms of the immediate costs in terms of the management of the land , i think they ’re pretty minimal in the early stages			0
. ' ' but certainly future budgets that the administration will offer will reflect the acquisition of these new properties			0
' the @entity179 , a private organization , donated land to create parts of two of the national monuments @entity16 created monday , in @entity70 and @entity63			1
the other three sites are in @entity185 , @entity186 and the state of @entity52 .			0

new *taxpayer* - funded @entity28 sites designated in five states
@entity50 : no new programs while budget sequester cuts are in place
@entity33 insists government *installations* will create economic growth
@entity16 used the same ' @entity6 ' featured in plot from @entity11
