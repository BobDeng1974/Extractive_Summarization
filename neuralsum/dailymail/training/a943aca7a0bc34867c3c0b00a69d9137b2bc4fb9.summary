@entity0 believes @entity1 have the players at their disposal to challenge for the title - but only if they can operate as a unit			1
the 27 - year - old @entity6 international moved to @entity8 in the summer but , like many new faces at @entity1 over the last 18 months , he has struggled to make an impact			1
having already picked up two red cards in just nine first - team outings , @entity0 is yet to show the type of form which saw him at the heart of the @entity17 team that won the @entity19 last season			1
@entity0 has struggled to make an impact since joining @entity1 in the summer @entity22 's tenure at @entity1 has not started well , with the former @entity24 boss seeing his side lose four of their six @entity27 home games so far this campaign			1
despite their stuttering start , as well as the uncertainty over the future of the ownership , new stadium and chairman @entity35 , @entity0 feels the sheer talent can shine through			2
the defender disagreed with @entity38 that the club 's supporters had to stop showing their dissatisfaction and has instead urged the players to gel together and turn their form around			2
' i think at @entity1 we have very good players who can fight for first position in the @entity27 , ' he said			1
@entity0 played in @entity6 's 2 - 1 win over @entity49 at @entity50 on wednesday ' we can fight for the @entity51 and the @entity19			1
but we need to improve like a team , to be like a team because i think we have got very good players			0
' i think this ( fan 's jeering the players ) is not the problem			0

i think that we have very good players , good enough to be higher in the @entity27			2
' there have only been 10 or 11 matches			0

' @entity0 played in @entity6 's 2 - 1 win over @entity49 at @entity50 on wednesday evening , operating alongside @entity67 's @entity66 in the centre of @entity70 's defence			1
@entity22 's tenure at @entity1 has not started well with four home defeats from six games a deflected @entity75 strike and a @entity77 penalty saw @entity6 come from behind to win their friendly , with a trip to face @entity80 at @entity81 next up for @entity70 's side			1
