by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:24 pm on 22nd november 2011 an unholy row has erupted after the @entity3 was accused of ' ruthlessly ' putting ' profit before communities ' by snapping up green belt land which had already been earmarked for development			1
the church purchased 180 hectares of green belt land around the area of @entity11 , @entity12 , in august , and could rake in a whopping £ 116m if housing and business developments go ahead			1
the @entity15 confirmed they had bought the land - known as @entity16 - from @entity17 along with four other sites for a combined total of £ 12.5m			1
not happy : @entity20 is leading a protest group against housing and business developments on land owned by the @entity3 a property expert said the agricultural value of the land would have been around £ 2m			1
but the church could now net a windfall as the 86 acres put forward as a possible business site are worth around £ 100,000 per acre			1
the remaining 358 acres could be worth £ 300,000 per acre if used for residential purposes			1
@entity31 , mp for @entity11 , urged the church to ' practice what it preaches '			1
he said : ' they want to " maximise the income from their investment portfolio "			2
they say that they have to do this because it is their " legal duty "			2
protesting : action group leader @entity20 has accused the church of seeking to profit at the expense of locals ' that would be the same " legal duty " that obliges @entity51 companies to maximise profits for their shareholders but whose behaviour prompted the archbishop of york to warn that such behaviour can " weaken community life "			1
' our church leaders are perfectly entitled to argue that the worst excesses of capitalism should be curbed			1
' pursuing profit before anything else takes us back to the worst excess of a by - gone age and senior members of the clergy may well want to speak out against it			2
' but should n't they start a little closer to home ? as far as the land at @entity74 is concerned , the @entity15 that i have referred to are in a remarkably strong position should they wish to practice what they preach			1
' i suspect my constituents in @entity78 will struggle to reconcile an attitude of profit before communities with the archbishop of @entity84 's invitation to strive for a " change of ethics to the accumulation of wealth "			2
' @entity20 , 51 , is spearheading the @entity89 , who oppose the plans - which will be implemented if a @entity92 put forward by council officers is accepted by members			1
now , he has accused the church of seeking to profit at the expense of locals and has revealed he is so ' disillusioned ' that he has turned his back on the church he loves			1
mr @entity20 , managing director of a haulage company , said : ' i 've been going to church for years but not now			1
' it 's a sad moment for me			2
but i have to stand up for what i believe in			0
' here i am year in , year out looking for money for @entity105 , but by buying the land they are getting rid of farmers who produce barley , corn and other products , and turning it into a concrete city			0
' this is the last bit of green belt land to separate @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity11			0
' they are just making money for themselves			0
why should i dig deep to help the third world when the church is just profiting for itself ? similar : vicar @entity121 said the situations in @entity11 and outside @entity123 resonate because society is asking questions about how we measure success ' what the church really should be doing is giving money to run - down churches instead of sending us out begging for money			1
' i 've cancelled my direct debit to the church and have no plans to return			1
' we have to stop the plan before it gets the go - ahead			1
if the council gets what it wants , the land will be brown belt and they can develop on it			0
' even @entity121 , the vicar of @entity146 in @entity147 , attended a protest meeting along with over 600 other locals , insisting that there is a difference between local parishes and the church ' head office '			2
@entity155 , 50 , said : ' i have strong sympathies with where the action group are coming from			0
' i hope people can see the difference between local church communities and the " head office " which is rather detached from life on the ground			2
' the situations in @entity11 and outside @entity123 resonate because our society is clearly asking big questions about how we measure success - is it an accumulation of wealth and status ? ' a spokesman for the @entity15 said : ' it is for the democratically - elected local planning authority to assess the best balance for its area of employment , housing , and other amenities			0
' we have been liaising with various representatives of the local community since buying this land in august			0
should those responsible decide to allocate the land in the long - term for use as a business park and for housing , we would support that			0
' the local authority 's plans , to go before the council tomorrow , state that they need 25,400 homes in @entity116 by 2028 including the @entity74 site			2
@entity195 , @entity196 's acting director of place , said : ' the use of green belt land is , as we would expect , a contentious issue			0
' but , surprisingly , many people are unaware that 70 per cent of land in @entity116 falls within the green belt			0
' this means that virtually all homes , offices , factories , shops , schools and parks are concentrated in the remaining 30 per cent			0
' this proposal requires no more than one per cent of the green belt to be released for potential future development			0
' @entity214 , from @entity215 said : ' we were very shocked by these proposals			0
' we think there is sufficient brown belt land in the area so the council should not have to build on green belt land			0
' we will continue the fight against this development			0
green belt land is precious			0

@entity3 could rake in £ 116m if plans go ahead
