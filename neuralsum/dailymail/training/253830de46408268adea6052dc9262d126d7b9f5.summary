@entity0 , 25 , has been documenting her attempts at feeding herself and her three - year - old son @entity1 on £ 10 a week for the past year			1
a 9p carrot , cumin and kidney bean burger , 30p chilli and 22p apricot curry are among the frugal and healthy recipes that have caught the attention of publisher @entity5 , which has signed her up to produce a book packed with more than 100 ideas for making the most of a tight budget			1
ms @entity29 , from @entity30 , was job - hunting and living on benefits when she started her blog following a councillor 's attack on single mothers in her local paper , which appeared under the headline : ' druggies , drunks and single mums are ruining our town '			1
she began attending council meetings and writing about politics and budget meals on her a girl called @entity0 blog following encouragement from friends			1
she used a @entity54 phone to write and upload her posts as she does not own a computer			1
since then , she has appeared on the @entity58 sofa to talk about her experience			2
a nutritionist on the show told her that the portion sizes were too small			2
but ms @entity29 told @entity63 : ' i eat four times a day , have breakfast , lunch , dinner , tea and snacks			2
' you could eat twice as much and still save lots of money			2
' ms @entity29 shops from the value and reduced ranges at @entity77 's , her nearest shop , and grows her own herbs to make the most of her £ 10 , which is what she has left after paying bills and rent			1
she sang the praises of value ranges , where kidney beans and chopped tomatoes are a quarter of the price of the branded equivalents , and said shoppers should n't be turned off by the ' unattractive ' packaging of the bottom shelf products			2
local food banks also give out copies of her recipes to help others feeding themselves on very little			2
' chopped tomatoes turn up in pretty much everything ' , she said , while handfuls of frozen vegetables , such as green beans and spinach , pad out meals and flour , pasta , rice and @entity119 or soya milk are cupboard essentials			1
' i throw things together and if they work they make it on to the blog			1
' ms @entity29 , who was recently hired as a trainee reporter at the @entity128 , has criticised the government for not understanding the difficulties of those surviving on benefits			2

' it can happen to anyone , ' she told @entity144			2
' people quote @entity147 ’s claim about being able to live on £ 53 a week all of the time , but they do n’t realise that when get that payment you have to cover everything with it			1
you are not exempt from bills all of a sudden			2
' she told @entity63 : ' if they could spend a week with one of us , they 'd see things a lot differently '			2
she receives emails , messages and tweets every day from people who say her blog has helped them make savings and cope with the shock of redundancy			1
' you feel like you 're the only person in the world this has happened to , ' she said			2
but the blog has made her realise : ' you 're not going through this on your own			1
' this bean and vegetable burger with vegetable rice , posted to her @entity176 page during a @entity178 , cost only 14p in one blogpost , entitled @entity180 , she wrote : ' poverty is n’t just having no heating , or not quite enough food , or unplugging your fridge and turning your hot water off			2
' it ’s not a tourism trade , it ’s not cool , and it ’s not something that mps on a salary of £ 65k a year plus expenses can understand , let alone our pm who states that we ’re all in this together			1
' poverty is the sinking feeling when your small boy finishes his one @entity201 and says ‘ more mummy , bread and jam please mummy ’ as you ’re wondering whether to take the tv or the guitar to the pawn shop first , and how to tell him that there is no bread or jam			2
' she has raised more than £ 2,500 for @entity212 through her blog by taking on a @entity215 challenge to feed her family for a week on only £ 5			1

she bought one of everything from the supermarket 's value range and thought : ' right - what can i make out of this ? ' her blog readers have become an online support group , she told @entity63			1
' every time i spoke to friends i was banging on about how awful things were			0
' i was boring myself			0
' she refers back to the hunger hurts post as ' the pinnacle ' of how bad things were while she was unemployed and trying to support herself and her child			0
' people tell me : " thank god it 's not just me , i 'm in the same situation "			0
' ms @entity29 gave birth to her son while she worked at a fire service call centre , but the job and relationship with her son 's father did not work out , and he was unable to support them			0
she was approached for advice by @entity258 mp @entity257 , who fed herself for a week on £ 18 in february to experience what life would be like for her constituents in @entity262 once the ' bedroom tax ' came into force last month			1
ms @entity29 told @entity63 : ' i would say the cuts are quite draconian , though i do understand we do n't have an endless pot to prop up welfare			0
' she called for a change in the way housing benefit is paid , criticising the way it is paid every four week in arrears rather than monthly and in advance , and highlighted the stress of having to negotiate with letting agents and landlords for their patience			0
