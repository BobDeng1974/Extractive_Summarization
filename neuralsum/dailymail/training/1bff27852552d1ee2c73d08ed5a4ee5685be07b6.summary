it 's a craze that 's been blamed squarely on the internet - but as these 100 - year - old photos reveal , cat owners have been dressing up their pets since long before the age of the blog			0
the surreal catalogue shows kittens in dungarees , silly paper hats , bonnets , bow ties and dresses , and has been revealed as part of a landmark archive of 12 million out - of - copyright images which are being placed online by a single academic			1
@entity18 , a fellow at @entity19 in @entity20 , hopes his vast collection on the photo - sharing site @entity23 will become a landmark new resource for history - lovers around the world			1
the photos from @entity38 and @entity39 : a @entity40 by @entity41 are part of a vast collection of out - of - copyright images which have been uploaded to @entity23 by an academic tea time : the text before this image reads : ' i wish someone would hurry and bring me some milk			1
mine is all gone and so is my mouse			0
i wonder if this is all we are going to have to eat			0
i am so hungry i shall have to go home and catch a rat			0
the @entity57 is asking some one to tell a story			0
i believe she means me			0
yes , dear @entity57 , i will ' @entity60 wardrobe : the surreal photos feature cats dressed up in dungarees , overalls and dotty bow ties			1
the book is just one of thousands uploaded to @entity23 the cat images were drawn from a 1911 collection called @entity38 and @entity39 : a @entity40 by @entity41 , a @entity71 children 's author who sold millions of books in the first half of the @entity74			1
the book is just one among 600 million library book pages which have been scanned for uploading to the archive by mr @entity18 - and the range is astounding			1
the images stretch from 1500 to 1922 , when copyright laws kicked in , and range from colourful depictions of @entity57 @entity84 's spectacular coronation parade to intricate pen - and - ink drawings of human anatomy and mosquitoes			2
there is a disastrously inaccurate drawing of a dodo made by a @entity92 researcher long after the animal became extinct , along with a rather chilling map of how the then - fading @entity95 would be turned into @entity96 including @entity97 and @entity98			0
other images show the beginnings of @entity96 's railway history from the @entity102 to @entity103 , the @entity104 seafront and an early layout for the @entity106			2
going for a ride : the cats are in surreal situations - though the collection also includes intricate drawings of human anatomy and a hair - raising sketch of a mosquito picture purrfect : as with humans , much of the expression comes from the eyes , but having a bizarre array of hats and bonnets probably does n't do any harm strike a pose : despite his archive containing three million images so far , mr @entity18 could n't help admitting the cat images were among his favourites in the collection long before the digging of the @entity130 there were books discussing how it would be possible , and charts showed off the dramatic spread of @entity136 's telephone throughout the @entity71			1
mr @entity18 carried out the incredible trawl in his spare time without a penny of funding			1
it was made possible by writing software which took out - of - copyright books which had already been uploaded to the internet , stripping out their images and adding keywords and context to make the archive searchable			1
almost three million images have been uploaded so far , and by the time the project is finished there are expected to be 12 million			1
despite the huge wealth of historical images , he could n't help admitting that the cat pictures were among his favourites			1
he told @entity156 : ' i came up with the project last fall , and ran a pilot of the project across all 600 million pages earlier this year , but with small - resolution images , just to see what it would produce			2
husband and wife ? many of the cats are dressed up in intricate costumes , their size suggesting they may have been painstakingly custom - designed shut - eye : in one case , a cat is pictured in a tiny bed			0
the researcher said : ' the project was entirely unfunded and there was no huge team , just me , and i did it entirely in what little spare time i had			1
so , its a perfect example of what 's possible today from purely volunteer and personal projects in the era of " big data " ! ' the researcher added : '' i wanted to be able to search for images matching a certain keyword , to be able to trace imagery through time			2
for example , to see the imagery of the " telephone " change over the decades as it changed from being the realm of male businessmen at work to the whole family at home ' mystery : what makes the online @entity23 archive so curious is that many of the photos come with only cryptic descriptions , leaving the viewer guessing as to their origins modern day : cat memes were thought to have started online like these two felines who have made waves on social media posing for dinner ( left ) and wearing a fez ( right ) ' the results were so stunning that i then went back and created the final full - resolution version you see today			2

for example , to see the imagery of the " telephone " change over the decades as it changed from being the realm of male businessmen at work to the whole family at home			0
' i realised there were so many books that had been digitised about the telephone , but there was simply no way to just see a collage of all of their images			0
so , this project was born			0
' for the vast majority of the images you see in books , there is n't some original copy hanging in a museum somewhere - the printed copy of that image you see in that book is likely the only copy surviving of that image			2
so , in a way this is also sort of an art project , creating the world 's ultimate online art museum ! ' fascinating : the archive on @entity23 will eventually number 12 million images and contains several gems			1
this chart was printed in the @entity274 in 1922 intricate : in the days before photography there are well - studied drawings of everything from the growth of the telephone in 1922 ( left ) to a human head in 1905 ( right ) needs work : the description of this drawing of a dodo from an 1848 book remarked on how inaccurate it was , resembling the animal as much as it did a fighting cock hair - raising : this mosquito comes from the 1867 book @entity293 's science - gossip : an illustrated medium of interchange and gossip for students and lovers of nature explaining his software , he added : ' it actually is quite simple , which is what makes the project so amazing			1
' it relies on the fact that when a book undergoes @entity310 to make it searchable , that software automatically identifies all of the images in the book so that it wo n't look there for text			2
' historically that information is just discarded , but in this case my tool goes back and uses that information to extract all of those images			0
' it amazes me that people have been digitising books and ocr'ing them for decades and no - one had ever thought to use that discarded information to extract and catalogue the images			0
' i 'm going to be releasing the software and other technical instructions for other libraries to use in the next few weeks			0
' you can browse the archive yourself by using the search tool on @entity23			0
@entity335 plans : just as the @entity337 was in its dying days in 1895 , this map was printed under the title ' the electoral government of @entity96 : a suggestion ' history : this 1902 image showed @entity102 more than 100 years ago , with the @entity343 , @entity345 station and @entity346 visible in the foreground grand : the collection also includes incredible images of the coronation procession for @entity84 which rumbled through @entity102 in 1838 impressive : the images were taken from a publication called @entity354 of the procession at the coronation of @entity84 , june 28 , 1838			0
