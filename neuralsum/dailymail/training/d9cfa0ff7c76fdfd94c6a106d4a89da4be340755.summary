by @entity0 at least 50 @entity2 families have had their holidays ruined after being struck down with violent vomiting and diarrhoea at a five - star hotel			1
the outbreak of the bug happened at the £ 200 - per night @entity9 on the @entity11 island @entity12			1
so far it has lasted ten days but staff are reportedly still letting people check in , insisting it is not serious			1
the hotel where 50 @entity2 families have been struck down by a vomiting bug is on the @entity11 island of @entity12 ( file picture of @entity21 ) first aid desks have been erected to assess guests before allowing them to enter restaurants and public areas			0
one family of three , of @entity27 , @entity28 , spent £ 3,000 on their holiday through @entity31			1
they fell ill almost immediately and spent almost a week in their room before shelling out to fly home			1
the manager claimed no more that 100 people had been affected and insisted the outbreak is not due to poor hygiene at his hotel			1
but one guest posted on @entity42 : ' unfortunately the entire holiday experience was ruined by an outbreak of what i suspect , as a doctor myself , to be a viral gastroenteritis , possibly norovirus			1
' i became ill with violent vomiting and profuse watery diarrhoea on the monday evening , my older son on tuesday morning , husband on tuesday evening and younger son tuesday night			0
' an outbreak such as this can happen in an environment such as this quite easily			1
that is not so much the issue			0
the issue lies with the appalling manner in which it was handled by the hotel			0
' the private doctor did not lay a hand on a patient , was of little help with advice on rehydration and management of personal hygiene and could n't wait to get away fast enough ! ' another said : ' the bug struck all of us in the early hours of tuesday			0
i thought it was just us until i went to reception to see the chaos			0
' i called for a doctor , who was already on site because he had seen so many already			0
' in response , the manager said : ' we have experienced a sickness bug that affected some guest ’s ; the symptoms they experienced were high temperature , vomiting and diarrhea			2
' the guests who stayed in their rooms were feeling better within 24 – 48 hours with the aid of simple medication			0
' @entity31 is ' facilitating requests for an early return ' and offering alternative trips to people heading to the venue			1
earlier this month it was revealed at least 70 @entity2 holidaymakers were struck down by a vomiting bug that ruined breaks at two resorts in @entity104			2
at least 50 fell ill at @entity105 , on the @entity107 island of @entity108 , and 20 at @entity109 , on the neighbouring island of @entity111			0
a sickness bug also left at least 100 @entity2 tourists ill , with several on drips after it swept through an @entity116 holiday resort			2
holidaymakers at the @entity119 complex were affected by the bug , thought to be @entity121 , which causes diarrhoea , stomach cramps and fever			0
people staying at the four - star resort in @entity128 said some tourists were confined to their rooms during the majority of their stay at the hotel , with some on intravenous drips			2
many of those affected blamed the outbreak on poor hygiene and dirty utensils and buffet containers .			2
