in the latest instalment of his weekly column , chief sports writer @entity0 gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week , saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver ... what 's hot the championship specifically , the top four going into this weekend : @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
what ’s not to like ? all of those clubs would be an addition to the @entity16 – but each for very different reasons			1
@entity9 – well , @entity19 deserves a break			1
he did a great job at @entity22 in @entity23 , got @entity24 off to a good start under @entity26 in the @entity8 last season , and was desperately unlucky not to come up with @entity9 in the play - offs in may			1
despite that setback he kept the momentum going through the summer and now sits top of the league			2
@entity9 lead the championship by a point after 19 gruelling games and look a solid shout for promotion the much - maligned @entity19 has rejuvenated the @entity38 since taking over in september of last year @entity11 and @entity12 – two new names for the @entity16 , two traditionally small clubs with loyal followings			1
@entity42 at @entity11 probably has the most unconventional background of any manager in the professional leagues , coming from the @entity47 trading floors , while @entity48 at @entity12 is heading for the top division one way or another			1
if either club sustained their early form it would be a giant achievement			2
dumped by @entity56 , manager @entity55 is again proving his worth with limited resources			2
second in the league , total spending £ 10,000 , and that on @entity61 from @entity62			0
the man ’s a genius			0
@entity42 's @entity11 have been one of the surprise packages after promotion from @entity69 now in his second spell at @entity12 , 37 - year - old @entity48 ( right ) has guided the @entity71 into fourth @entity61 has made the left back slot his own and is being watched by several @entity16 clubs @entity74 according to @entity75 of @entity76 the explanation for his bad form this season is juju people employed by his family casting black magic spells			1
and it may be worse than he thought			0
@entity74 is probably the only rational explanation for @entity87 ’s first @entity16 goal since march 2			1
they conjured @entity87 ’s winner against @entity89 just to make poor @entity75 appear even worse			2
@entity87 ( left ) hit his second @entity16 goal of 2014 , as @entity75 's drought goes on putting your feet up @entity93 , the sofa manufacture company , are the new sponsors of @entity94 you may find this ironic – a marriage of sloth and extreme athleticism – until considering some of the @entity99 ’s other backers			1
@entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
so now , all in the name of supporting the team , you can fill up with petrol and drive to the local fast food chain , emerging weighed down with burgers and fizzy drinks , before heading off home to veg out on the sofa and wolf the lot down while watching the @entity114 on one of the new @entity116			0
not forgetting that @entity94 are also sponsored by @entity117 , just in case the whole process makes you sick , requiring @entity120			0
what 's not moaning about @entity122 @entity123 started it			1
beginning a run of nine games in 36 days with @entity129 ’s 3 - 0 win over @entity130 on saturday , the @entity125 kicked off an intensive spell of whinging about the number of matches in december			2
he was quickly followed by fellow countryman @entity134 , who claimed @entity135 were worse off than rivals such as @entity129 , because they had the same number of fixtures – but fewer players			2
maybe if they had n’t sold half the first team that would n’t be such a problem			0
as for @entity147 , as he is not even fully through his first season in @entity146 football , he may wish to consider that we like it like this – and that if he does n’t , we can all see a way out			0
@entity123 has complained about @entity129 's congested fixture list ahead of nine fixtures in 36 days @entity135 boss @entity134 also berated his side 's fixture pile - up ahead of the festive period @entity134 's side have suffered back - to - back defeats and take on @entity129 on monday night non-apology apologies ' i apologise if i offended anybody , ' said @entity161			1
' if the song offended anybody , i ’m sorry , ' echoed @entity165 chief @entity164			2
they ’re all the rage now			0
' if i offended anybody … ' they begin , when the protagonist knows damn well he offended – that ’s why he ’s apologising			0
the non-apology apology also makes it appear as if the fault is with the offended for taking offence ; the ‘ if ’ implying that they are many more sane , rational people out there who care not a jot that you sang a song about a terrorist martyr / insulted the @entity183 / exchanged racist text messages / engaged in sexist banter / committed rape , not all of which can be attributed to @entity161 and @entity189 , of course			1
nobody says sorry any more ; and even when they do , it ’s still your fault			0
@entity161 made a non-apology apology after his post on @entity197 caused a storm @entity199 it has not been a good week for the captain of @entity202			1
he put through his own net against @entity24 last saturday , his weak header gifted @entity206 an equaliser on tuesday , and he was then sent off			0
@entity55 , during his time playing centre half for @entity209 , went on a similarly bleak run			0
asked about his latest blunder , he did not shirk			0
' anyone can have a bad career , ' deadpanned @entity55			0
@entity199 wants the ground to cave in after scoring @entity24 's equaliser during @entity202 's loss at @entity219 @entity199 's week to forget continued after being dismissed by @entity220 in the 3 - 1 defeat by @entity206			1

@entity19 deserves a break and he 's kept momentum going at @entity9
championship high - *flyers* @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 would also be worthy additions to the @entity16
does juju explain @entity87 's second @entity16 goal of 2014 ?
@entity123 and @entity134 complained about the festive period
@entity164 and @entity161 *joined* the non-apology apology club
and @entity202 's @entity199 has had a week to forget
