by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 18 october 2012 it looks like this man has had the folds of his brain tattooed across his head - but instead this is a rare medical condition			1
the skull of the 21 - year - old @entity9 patient , described this week in the @entity10 , looked perfectly normal two years ago			1
but then his scalp started to change , growing thicker in irregular places , resulting in bizarre folds of thicker skin across his head in a pattern that unintentionally mirrors the shape of the brain			1
the rare condition ' cutis verticis gyrate ' made this 21 - year - old @entity9 head look like the surface of his brain two @entity9 doctors studied the un-named man 's condition - a rare one known as ' cutis verticis gyrata ' - and reported no other symptoms affecting the man			1
while he is described as a ' intellectually impaired ' , he does not have any psychiatric or neurological conditions and his poor performance at school is not said to be linked to his scalp condition			2
instead the condition is benign , if bizarre , and affects him only cosmetically - in fact , the man is said to be quite proud of his condition			2
dr. @entity38 a dermatologist at the @entity40 , who studied the patient , said : ' the patient did not have the habit of covering his head ... the condition did not bother him cosmetically			0
' it 's a benign and essentially aesthetic condition			0
' @entity49 verticis gyrata occurs more commonly in men , and usually develops shortly after puberty			0
the cause of the deformation is not known , although sometimes it does seem to correlate with brain - related disorders such as schizophrenia and seizures			0
while surgery can improve the appearance of the scalp , it is costly , and requires regular follow - up treatments - and as this man is happy with his looks , in this case it was not required .			0

@entity10 describes condition where skin on the scalp grows and folds over itself
causes of rare medical condition is still *unsolved*
