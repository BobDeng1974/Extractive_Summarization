according to the fashion world , the @entity0 are back — and there ’s no one happier about it than me , as someone who lived and breathed every second of it			1
designers such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 showered catwalks last year in flares , jumpsuits , wide - brimmed hats and wild prints			1
but the retro revival does n’t stop at the ankles ; summer stilettos have been ditched in favour of towering platforms on almost every @entity22 in the country			1
as a top model during the @entity0 , i lived in platforms			1
@entity25 was always better , especially because — at 5 ft 8 in — i was a little on the short side for the fashion world			1
but now , aged 61 and with 11 grandchildren , i ’m not sure i can carry them off with such aplomb			1
surely thin , slimming lines and elegant shapes are what i ’m after rather than weighty clodhoppers ? to find out if they can ever be flattering , i put eight pairs through their paces			1
@entity48 , £ 130 shoes : @entity50 completely inappropriate — but i think these are divine			2
i had a pair of red snakeprint platforms by @entity54 like these more than 40 years ago			1
sadly , those days are gone			2
no one over 30 should attempt these now			2
at 6 in , they are impossible to walk in , though the colour is fabulous			2
i ’d call these ankle breakers			2
height : 6 in @entity60 : 3/10 clarks , £ 150 shoes : @entity63 help ! these look like dumb - bells stuck to my feet			1
they are out of proportion with my legs			2
not even wearing these shoes with a delicate dress saves them			0
height : 5 in @entity60 : 0/10 next , £ 35 shoes : @entity76 these work because the straps are thin and dainty and the heel is not a thick wedge			0
they would jazz up a tailored suit or little black dress perfectly			0
i ’d buy them in a heartbeat			0
height : 5 in @entity60 : 9/10 @entity87 , £ 125 shoes : @entity89 these are reminiscent of my seventies ‘ peace , love and brown rice ’ days			0
the clog style is not sophisticated enough for a lady in her 60s			1
i clumped about as though walking on stilts			0
height : 5 in @entity60 : 2/10 @entity99 , £ 79 shoes : @entity101 my absolute favourites : the front platform ( about an inch thick ) is just enough to boost your height without looking clunky			0
@entity107 is a bright and breezy colour for spring and summer			0
height : 4.5 in @entity60 : 10/10 @entity110 , £ 49.99 shoes : @entity112 i know i should n’t , but i love these skyscrapers			0
forty years ago , i would have practically slept in them			0
padded soles and thick ankle straps mean they are surprisingly comfortable			0
height : 5 in @entity60 : 6/10 @entity119 , £ 55 shoes : @entity121 from the knees down i look great , but i ’m not sure a 61 - year - old can get away with these			1
they are as subtle as a sledgehammer and too cumbersome in heavy looking black			0
height : 5½ in @entity60 : 6/10 office , £ 65 shoes : @entity130 one of the sturdiest pair of heels i ’ve ever worn			1
the soft leather and mule style is spot - on seventies			1
the open toe is perfect for summer and these are age appropriate , too			0
hallelujah ! height : 4 in @entity60 : 10/10			0

the fashion trends of the moment show that @entity0 style is back
@entity29 was a top model then and spent a lot of time in platforms
here she puts eight pairs of sky - high heels through their paces
