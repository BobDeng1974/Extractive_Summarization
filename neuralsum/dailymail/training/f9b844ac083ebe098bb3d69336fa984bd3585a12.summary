for many @entity1 , the september 11 consulate attack was the last straw in one of the biggest problems @entity1 has faced since the death of longtime dictator @entity65 last year - the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket - propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police			2
