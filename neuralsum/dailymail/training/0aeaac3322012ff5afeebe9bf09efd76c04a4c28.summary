by @entity0 a mural in a @entity3 temple has been criticised as ' totally inappropriate ' for depicting the 9/11 terrorist attacks alongside comic book characters and celebrities			1
the @entity7 at @entity8 is the bizarre pet project of controversial @entity3 artist @entity10 as well as depicting planes flying into the @entity13 , the mural at @entity8 features fictional characters such as @entity15 and @entity16 , celebrities like @entity18 , as well as fighter jets and spaceships			1
photography inside the temple is forbidden , but one tourist managed to take this picture using a camera phone			2
the 31 - year - old insurance broker from @entity59 , who did not want to be named , said : ' the whole place is very strange			0
there 's a pit full of hands and skulls outside that looks like something from the @entity68			0
' inside i was shocked to see a painting of planes flying into the @entity13			2
i just think it 's totally inappropriate			0
' the bizarre imagery continues outside the temple itself , with a sculpture of @entity77 sunk into the ground in order to enter the temple visitor pass over a bridge surrounded by a pit full of demonic hands and skulls @entity10 first drew up designs for the temple in 1997 and began working on it with a team of assistants the whole structure is not due to be completed until 2070 , though it already serves as a tourist attraction designed by @entity10 in 1997 , the surreal temple is still under construction and is n't due to finish until 2070			1
@entity10 uses a team of 60 other artists to help him work on the building , and has passed designs on to them so they can continue working after he dies			1
another visitor to the temple , 38 - year - old business owner @entity101 , said : ' it was so different from anything i had seen before			0
' when we entered i was pretty shocked to see all those images from @entity107 - @entity18 , @entity108 , @entity41 , @entity16 and more			0
' i did not know what to think of it			0
it seemed some kind of a mockery			0
posting on his blog , he added : ' generally speaking it is an very out - of - the - box ( for a @entity36 temple ) and creative way of expressing one ’s ideas			0
' like @entity122 's cathedral in @entity123 , @entity10 has given designs to his staff to keep working after he dies the artist claims he is emulating traditional @entity3 temple art , which features scene of ancient @entity3 life alongside @entity36 symbolism			1
but he has been heavily criticised for his approach artwork around the temple ranges from the macabre to the magnificent to the downright bizarre unlike most other @entity3 temples which are usually brightly painted , the outside of the @entity7 is plain the outside of the temple is covered with intricate artwork and thousands of tiny mirrors to reflect sunlight traditional @entity3 art symbols , such as dragons , also feature as part of the immense artwork ' only death can stop my dream , but can not stop my project , ' he said in 2003 , adding that he believes the work will give him ' immortal life '			1
he is also behind the @entity153 temple in @entity154 , @entity155 , which contains another controversial mural charting the life of @entity51 from birth to death			1
however , mixed in with symbols from traditional @entity3 culture are punks sporting @entity162 and leather jackets , @entity164 , and @entity165			2
@entity15 , @entity166 , @entity167 and other cartoon characters all adorn this wall inside the temple captain @entity171 , @entity172 's character from @entity173 , surfs down @entity77 's arm the temple also features @entity36 statues and paintings which sit opposite the mural the artist claims this is in keeping with conventional @entity3 temple art which portrayed scenes from ancient @entity3 life alongside figures from @entity36 mythology			1
however his work has attracted strong criticism			0
speaking in 1998 , shortly after the @entity155 murals were finished , he said : ' i got complaints from everybody – from the [ @entity3 ] government , from monks and from other artists , saying that what i was doing was not @entity3 art. '			2
