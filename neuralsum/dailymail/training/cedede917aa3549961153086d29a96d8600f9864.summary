' i was absolutely shocked when dad said he had bought the waterslide , but i thought it would be brilliant to have in the garden , ' said @entity6 , from the village of @entity70 in @entity21			2
' it was very tricky to get all the pieces here as they are so big and heavy , but we managed to use our truck and hire an articulated lorry			0
' we 're planning to use it as a slide most of the year round , but we may put a paddling pool at the bottom in the summer and use a pump to get water flowing through			1
' @entity9 is really excited about it and we 're looking forward to it too			0
we 're all big kids			0
' her father @entity17 said he saw the slide being taken apart and thrown on the skip and thought it would be fun to rescue it			2
' we have often used the slide over the years and when i was taking my youngest daughter swimming when i noticed them breaking it up , ' he said			2
' i offered to have it and we ended up having 90 per cent of the black slide			0
@entity6 's lucky to have a big garden and it fits in well and the children will be able to have amazing fun			2

it still needs a few improvements but we 're getting there			0
' a spokesman for @entity111 spokesman said : ' the old flume had come to the end of its natural life , having undergone several repairs in the past			0
' we are investing approximately £ 170,000 in a new flume which should be in place by early next year			2
' as we understand it , the builder was approached by a member of the public who asked if he could take a few sections of the old flume to use as a feature in his garden			0
' it would have cost money to put it into landfill and so the builder agreed that the man could take sections			0
