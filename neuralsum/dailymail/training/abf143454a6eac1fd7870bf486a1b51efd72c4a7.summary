by @entity0 budget airlines are not carrying out new anti-terror security checks on electronic devices as confusion grows over exactly where the measures are being enforced			1
the @entity6 this week introduced new rules demanding passengers prove electrical items are working properly before they can be taken on some flights travelling to @entity11			1
but they are not being enforced by airlines such as @entity14 and @entity15 , as ministers ' refusals to make public exactly which routes are subject to the rigorous new procedures leads to increasing uncertainty among passengers			2
security checks : the @entity6 this week introduced new rules demanding passengers prove electrical items are working properly before they are allowed to board flights to @entity11 the new security measures - which require passengers to switch on electrical devices such as laptops , tablets and mobile phones to prove they work - initially only applied to @entity34 flights			1
on tuesday the @entity6 announced it had extended the rules to cover the @entity11 , and warned all passengers to ensure their electronic devices are fully charged before attempting to board flights arriving in and departing from @entity11			1
the @entity6 would not disclose the exact routes for security reasons , but @entity41 officials later claimed the routes affected include aircraft travelling between @entity11 and @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity46			1
there appeared to be some confusion over the new measures this morning , however , with a @entity15 official saying the budget airline ' does not expect the rules will have any effect on short haul flights within @entity44 '			0
it is understood the rules are not being enforced by airlines such as @entity14 ( pictured ) and @entity15 , as ministers ' refuse to make public exactly which routes are subject to the rigorous new procedures the electronic device checks introduced by the @entity6 this week will not affect all @entity11 passengers			1
although they have refused to make public the routes affected , ministers have provided a list of flights they consider require additional security checks			1
it is understood this includes flights to and from the @entity46 , @entity45 and parts of southern @entity44			0
if your flight is hit by additional security checks , it is unlikely you will know much about until you reach the boarding gate			0
arriving at the airport , passengers will check - in their hold luggage and pass through body and bag scanners into the departure lounge in the usual way			0
this will include ensuring all electronic devices being taken on board the flight - such as cameras and laptops - are packed away inside hand luggage bags			1
passengers are likely to expect extra checks if they called to the departure gate earlier than usual if their flight is affected			0
this is to allow for the extra time it takes security staff to check every electronic device is working properly			2
the @entity6 says all passengers arriving or leaving the @entity11 must prepare for the special measures , however			2
the teams working on the checks will have been hired by the airlines themselves , not by the airport , but the @entity6 has insisted all will be fully qualified security staff			2
if , for whatever reason , your device fails the security check , you will be forced to leave your device behind , and may even be banned from taking the flight itself			0
an @entity14 spokesman told @entity112 that the company was ' aware ' that the security measures may be stepped up , but said the new rules did not yet apply to its passengers			1
and despite the claims from the @entity41 officials , a number of passengers arriving from various locations within the @entity46 and @entity120 said security checks also remain as normal			0
however both @entity125 and @entity126 insist they are carrying out the additional security checks on all routes the @entity124 told them are affected the ' secondary ' checks are understood to take place at the boarding gate by staff contracted by the airlines themselves , not employees of the central security team that carries out body and luggage scans earlier in the boarding process			2
a @entity6 spokesman said he would not be drawn on the specifics of the checks , or when in the process they take place , but insisted they are carried out by qualified security staff			2
the new security measures are controversial as they could see innocent passengers forced to leave behind items worth thousands of pounds simply because the battery was not properly charged			1
if a laptop , tablet , @entity154 or mobile phone can not be switched on and proved to be working correctly , the @entity151 's guideline is that this item must not be allowed to travel			0
as these devices are commonly used to keep children amused during long waits in an airports departure lounge , the new rules could hit thousands of families			0
@entity162 said it had seen a 30 per cent increase in sales of battery chargers in its airport branches last week , when the measures were first imposed on flights to the @entity34 now that the rules also apply to flights to the @entity11 , this figure is expected to soar further			0
there is also concern that the time taken to check every device could cause chaos and put additional pressure on already overstretched airport security systems .			0

@entity6 announced new security measures this week
passengers must prove their electronic devices are in full working order
items that do not work - or are not charged - no longer allowed to travel
but ministers have refused to publicly state which routes are affected
this has led to confusion over exactly where measures are being enforced
