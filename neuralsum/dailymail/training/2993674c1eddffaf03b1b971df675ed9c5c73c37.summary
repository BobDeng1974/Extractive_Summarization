by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 25 march 2012 updated : 15:11 est , 26 march 2012 chancellor @entity2 has risked causing a rift in the @entity4 after putting plans for a third runway at @entity7 ' back on the table ' , it has been claimed			1
mr @entity2 has persuaded @entity9 to push for a u-turn on plans for expansion at @entity7 , in a move which has reportedly infuriated @entity14 by overturning a key manifesto pledge			2
the chancellor has refused to rule out expanding @entity17 's biggest airport because he believes it is key to our ' hub status ' and essential to @entity17 's economic future , according to the @entity22			1
vital : @entity2 has reportedly claimed that expansion of @entity7 is key to @entity17 's economic future full to capacity : experts claimed not expanding @entity7 would cost the @entity17 economy up to £ 8.5bn a year deputy prime minister @entity14 , along with environmental campaigners and transport secretary @entity30 are all among those said to be furious at the move			1
the newspaper said that mr @entity2 introduced @entity7 as a possible venue for expansion at a @entity37 meeting this month			2
earlier this month a report suggested that the @entity17 economy will suffer by up to £ 8.5billion per year over the next decade if @entity7 does not undergo significant expansion			1
if expansion were to go ahead it would not happen until after the next election			0
a strategy review on aviation , combined with a paper on ' hub status ' , is due later this summer			0
rift : the plan by @entity2 to put @entity7 expansion ' back on the table ' is said to have infuriated deputy prime minister @entity14 just five months ago plans for @entity7 expansion were said to have been ' off the agenda ' after @entity52 apparently joined the @entity4 in ruling out the third runway			2
mr @entity2 appeared to back the decision when his @entity55 in november declared that he would consider all options for @entity58 - east airport expansion , with the exception of @entity7			0
activists had opposed plans for an expansion at @entity7 on the grounds of disturbance and pollution from aircraft			0
possible plans revealed last year showed how @entity7 could look if expansion went ahead the plans for a third runway have been met with constant strong opposition from local residents near the proposed site alternative : one of the other options proposed has been an airport hub on the @entity77 which would hold up to 150 million passengers a year both @entity52 and @entity80 manifestos in 2010 had promised there would be no third runway at @entity7 , but other factors appear to have now changed the mind of the chancellor			1
chief among those is a fear that @entity17 is being left behind by @entity90 rivals competing for business from @entity92 and @entity93			1
alternatives to @entity7 expansion include improving @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 for business flights , just 13 miles away			0
expansion at @entity101 has also been suggested but is not thought to be a popular idea , while the controversial ' @entity104 ' airport in the @entity77 would take too long to build , according to some .			0
