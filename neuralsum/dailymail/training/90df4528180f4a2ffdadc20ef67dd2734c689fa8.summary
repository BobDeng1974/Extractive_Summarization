many car manufacturers and phone makers rave about the smart systems in cars that are designed to help drivers safely use their devices at the wheel			2
but in a study , researchers found that such systems were actually dangerous , as drivers were distracted by misunderstood requests or poor service			2
on a scale of one to five , five being most distracting , @entity14 's @entity13 rated the worst at 4.14 while others such as @entity18 's @entity17 also ranked highly at 3.7			1
two studies were carried out by the @entity20 in @entity21 and the @entity22			1
they found that drivers were increasingly distracted by ' smart ' cars			1
this photo shows a driver during the @entity29 testing in @entity30 two studies were carried out by the @entity20 in @entity21 , and the @entity22			1
in one , they examined infotainment systems in some of the most common brands on the road , including @entity18 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			2
the other used @entity14 's @entity13 voice system to navigate , send texts , make social media posts and use the calendar without handling or looking at the phone			1
1.7 - @entity39 's @entity47 2.2 - @entity37 's @entity48 2.7 - @entity35 's @entity49 3.0 - @entity50 with @entity51 3.1 - @entity38 ' comand 3.7 - @entity18 's @entity17 4.14 - @entity14 's @entity13 the systems were tested by 162 university students and other volunteers in three settings - a laboratory , a driving simulator , and in cars while driving though a @entity30 neighbourhood			1
the voice - activated systems were graded on a distraction scale of 1 to 5 , with 1 representing no distraction and 5 comparable to doing complex math problems and word memorisation			1
@entity14 's @entity13 received the worst rating of 4.14			1
and test drivers using @entity13 in a driving simulator rear - ended another car on two separate occasions			2
@entity18 's @entity17 received the worst rating , 3.7 , among the infotainment systems			1
infotainment systems from three other automakers - @entity38 , @entity36 and @entity35 - were also rated more distracting for drivers than simply talking on a mobile			1
two of the infotainment systems were rated relatively low for distraction			0
@entity39 's @entity47 received a 1.7 , the distraction equivalent of listening to an audiobook , and @entity37 's @entity81 received a 2.2			0
during research , 162 students drove in simulators and around a neighbourhood while using different voice - activated integration systems			1
many of the test subjects found that the systems were unable to understand their requests			1
@entity14 's @entity13 ( stock image shown ) was rated the most distracting the systems with the worst ratings were those that made errors even though drivers ' voice commands were clear and distinct			1
drivers had to concentrate on exactly what words they wanted to use , and in what order , to get the systems to follow their commands , creating a great deal of frustration			0
for example , an infotainment system might recognise a command to change a radio station to ' @entity109 ' but not ' @entity110 ' or simply ' 103.5			0
' @entity13 also sometimes garbled text messages or selected wrong phone numbers from personal phonebooks			0
during one test , it called 911 instead of the phone number requested by the volunteer driver , and the driver had to scramble to end the call before it went through			0
@entity13 found the number in the driver 's phonebook because the driver had called it once before			2
' when these systems become more complex , like sending text messages or posting to @entity127 , it pushes the workloads to pretty high levels and may be dangerous while driving , ' said professor @entity130 , the @entity22 psychology professor who led the two studies			2
the voice - activated systems ( shown being tested ) were graded on a distraction scale of 1 to 5 , with 1 representing no distraction , and 5 comparable to doing complex math problems and word tasks			1
@entity18 's @entity17 received the worst rating , 3.7 , among the infotainment systems the studies contradict claims by car manufacturers , who have been pitching the voice systems to buyers as a way they can safely enjoy social media and connectivity			1
in april last year @entity150 researchers found that using voice commands to send text messages while driving - on software such as @entity14 's @entity13 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers			1
they found that both methods impacted driver response times equally - but that it often took voice recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages			2
the findings were then confirmed by the @entity20 in the @entity162 in june			0
it similarly found that as mental workload and distractions increase , reaction times get slower and brain function is compromised			0
in the run up to the @entity170 release , @entity14 added eyes - free technology to its latest @entity173 software			0
the @entity175 - free tool lets users control this the system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road			0
safety advocates claim drivers assume such systems are safe because they are incorporated into vehicles and are hands - free			0
the @entity187 , which regulates vehicle safety , has issued guidelines to automakers for dashboard systems and is working on similar guidelines for phone and voice - activated systems , but the guidelines are voluntary			1
' infotainment systems are unregulated , ' said @entity197 , president of the @entity198 and former chairman of the @entity200			0
' it is like the wild west , where the most critical safety feature in the vehicle - the driver - is being treated like a guinea pig in human trials with new technologies			0
' ' the good news is that really well - designed systems offer us the possibility to interact in ways that are n't so distracting , ' professor @entity130 said			0
' what we continue to see from customers is that they demand this level of technology in their vehicles , that access to music and access to calls is now a critical part of the driving experience and so we 're looking at innovative ways to provide that , ' said @entity18 spokeswoman @entity228			0
@entity14 noted in a statement that researchers did n't use the company 's @entity231 , which are designed for use in cars			2
however , professor @entity130 said researchers consulted with @entity14 before beginning the study			0
the study used an @entity173 version of @entity13 that was tweaked to be nearly identical to the @entity239 version , which was just recently released , he said			0

research was carried out by the @entity20 in @entity21 and the @entity22
they found that drivers were increasingly distracted by ' smart ' cars
162 students drove in simulators and around a neighbourhood while using different voice - activated integration systems
many of the test subjects found the systems *difficult* to understand
@entity14 's @entity13 was rated the most distracting with a score of 4.14 out of *5r*
other systems to come under fire were @entity18 's @entity17 and @entity36 's @entity50
