@entity1 do n't have to breed ' like rabbits ' and should instead practice ' responsible parenting ' , @entity0 has said			1
while firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception , @entity0 said there are plenty of church - approved ways to regulate births			1
but he said most importantly , no outside institution should impose its views on regulating family size , blasting what he called the ' ideological colonization ' of the developing world			1
he said : ' every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonized			2
' the @entity0 's comments , taken together with his defense of the @entity1 's ban on artificial contraception during the trip , signal that he is increasingly showing his more conservative bent , which has largely been ignored by public opinion or obscured by a media narrative that has tended to highlight his populist persona			1
on the trip , @entity0 gave his strongest defense yet of the 1968 encyclical @entity46 , which enshrined the church 's opposition to artificial birth control			1
he warned against ' insidious attacks ' against the family — a reference to gay marriage proposals — echoing language often used by overwhelmingly conservative @entity56 bishops			0
he insisted that ' openness to life is a condition of the sacrament of matrimony			0
' at the same time , however , he said it 's not true that to be a good @entity1 ' you have to be like rabbits			2
' he said ' responsible parenthood ' requires that couples regulate the births of their children , as church teaching allows			1
he cited the case of a woman he met who was pregnant with her eighth child after seven cesarean sections			0

the woman might argue that she should trust in @entity84			0
' but @entity84 gives you methods to be responsible , ' he said			2
he said there are many ' licit ' ways of regulating births that are approved by the church , an apparent reference to the @entity93 method of monitoring a woman 's cycle to avoid intercourse when she is ovulating			2
during the @entity99 's recent meeting on the family , @entity22 bishops denounced how aid groups and lending institutions often condition their assistance on a country 's compliance with their ideals : allowing health care workers to distribute condoms , or withdrawing assistance if legislation discriminating against gays is passed			0
' when imposed conditions come from imperial colonizers , they search to make people lose their own identity and make a sameness , ' he said			0
' this is ideological colonization			0
