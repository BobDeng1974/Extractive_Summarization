' pointless ' : many signs on the roads duplicate information or serve no obvious purpose @entity4 up of road signs warning of obvious speed bumps and lane closures , or just informing you that the sign is n’t in use ? transport secretary @entity11 has called for an end to ‘ pointless ’ signs – saying they confuse drivers and make the roads more dangerous			1
regulations are set to be tightened up , as it is revealed the number of signs cluttering @entity20 ’s roads has more than doubled in 20 years to 4.5million			2
this is around one sign for every seven cars on the roads			2
@entity11 said councils could clamp down on the constant alerts to motorists about loading restrictions , clearways , humps and speed limits , which are distracting and state the obvious			1
‘ over the past two decades we ’ve seen a huge rise in the number of unnecessary signs blotting the landscapes of our towns and cities ’ , he said			0
‘ many of the signs that go up are simply not needed and it has got to stop			0
as well as spoiling otherwise beautiful areas of the country , pointless signs just confuse drivers and make the roads less safe			1
’ a survey last year by an insurance company found one in three drivers admitted having a crash or a near miss because of baffling road signs			1
the @entity51 admitted at the time that @entity20 has around 9,000 signs which are redundant or misleading and need to be revised			0
it was also revealed by the survey that most people have no idea what many road signs mean			1
the number of clearaway signs , in yellow and black which mean no stopping between certain times , has soared in the past 20 years , yet the survey suggested 83pc of people do not understand them			0
nearly 7 in 10 people did not understand the red and blue circle which means no waiting , and half of drivers could not decipher a sign pointing out the correct lanes at a junction ahead			2
crackdown : transport secretary @entity11 has said unnecessary signs make the roads less safe a @entity75 source said : ‘ we ’re pushing for councils to stop pointlessly putting up loads of road signs where fewer would do the job fine			1
‘ it has become an issue as councils appear to have designated people whose job it is to handle what signs go up , some of whom are probably overzealous			2
it can end up looking hideous and all it does is confuse drivers			2
’ the department issued new guidance to councils about cutting pointless road signs last year			1
now they are going further by consulting on implementing central regulations			0
drivers will be asked whether they want to get rid of the requirement for speed limit repeater signs , and also axe signs when there are already road markings which provide adequate guidance			1
research published today shows the number of signs for speed bumps has soared by 2,000 per cent in 20 years			0
there were under 5,000 in 1993 , and nearly 100,000 today			0
the number of signs for clearways has risen from 3,444 to more than 110,000 , priority restrictions from 1,572 to 23,000 and speed limit signs doubled from around 225,000 to 442,000			0
the problem was symbolised two years ago by the village of @entity115 in @entity116 , which took on the council when the number of road signs reached a staggering 900 - one for every three residents			1
it was given the dubious honour of @entity20 ’s most over-signed place , with its quaint country lanes and stunning views blighted by hundreds of duplicate direction sign posts and give way signs			0
but after a battle with the council , it agreed to remove nearly 200 pointless signs .			0
