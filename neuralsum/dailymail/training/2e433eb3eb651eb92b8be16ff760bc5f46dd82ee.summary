@entity1 , 42 , died 14 hours after a routine operation for back pain , which may have been unnecessary , an inquest heard			1
consultant surgeon @entity13 accidentally cut an artery during the operation and staff at @entity17 failed to pick up on subsequent internal bleeding			1
locum senior house officer dr @entity19 , who trained in @entity20 , failed to act ' promptly and efficiently ' to give her a transfusion , according to a coroner			1
the medic knew miss @entity1 had suffered a ‘ massive blood loss ’ but instead of giving her the transfusion when blood became ready he called for more tests			1
in delivering her findings , assistant @entity30 coroner @entity29 said : ‘ it was a gross failure of basic medical attention for the doctor not to ensure the blood transfusion took place as soon as possible after the blood was ready			0
had he done so @entity1 would have lived			2
’ in her verdict , ms @entity29 said neglect contributed to miss @entity1 ’s death at @entity17 on march 13 2010 in that the transfusion should have been given more quickly			1
the inquest heard dr @entity19 had only been working at the hospital for a week - and - a - half and did not have full orthopaedic experience			1
he no longer works there			0
although he became aware of the blood loss at 11.40pm he ‘ did not appreciate the severity of the situation ’ and gave no instructions for close observations on miss @entity1			2
the coroner said after receiving a low haemoglobin reading he ‘ should have been pushing every panic button available ’			0
blood was ready to collect at 11.55pm but was not picked up until 1.10am the next day and the transfusion only started at 1.25am			0
‘ even then she was left by herself and without any care as she was found alone and fitting at 1.35am , ’ said the coroner			0
miss @entity1 then went into cardiac arrest and it was too late to save her life			2
‘ had a blood transfusion been started as soon as possible after the bloods were available @entity1 would have lived , ’ the coroner said			1
administrator @entity66 , of @entity67 , @entity17 , who had two degrees and was studying for a third in engineering , suffered back pain which often left her bedridden			1
she was told if she did not have an operation on a prolapsed disc the pain could return			0
she opted for surgery but mr @entity13 got the wrong disc , pierced it and ruptured an artery which went unnoticed and she began bleeding			1
ms @entity29 outlined a catalogue of errors which had been made during her treatment			0
she said it was ‘ wholly unclear ’ why mr @entity13 did not refer miss @entity1 for physiotherapy rather than have an operation as surgery was ‘ not inevitable ’ in her case			1
the surgeon did damage the artery during the operation with an instrument but it was not clear how it was caused			2
locum senior house officer dr @entity19 , who trained in @entity20 , failed to act ' promptly and efficiently ' to give her a transfusion , at @entity17 although miss @entity1 ’s blood pressure dropped twice during the operation and in recovery this information was not passed on to nursing staff			1
the nurses did not realise the significance of the haemoglobin reading and anaesthetist dr @entity101 failed to inform mr @entity102 as he should have done			2
a trainee nurse inserted a wrong entry in an early warning chart which could have alerted doctors to the situation and observations were not carried out as confusion reigned over who was responsible			0
@entity111 of staff were ‘ wholly inadequate ’ , said the coroner , and nurses assumed miss @entity1 was a ‘ routine ’ patient			1
dr @entity19 was unaware of the low haemoglobin reading until he got the results of an earlier blood test			1
miss @entity1 ’s death came just weeks after consultants in the orthopaedic department warned management of the ‘ grave risks ’ to patient safety because of staffing levels			2
but the coroner ruled that the breakdown in relations had no effect on the care given to miss @entity1			2
‘ the errors which led to @entity1 ’s death arose because of personal errors and not as a result of any systems failure , ’ she said			0
deficiencies in her care had been investigated by the hospital trust and ‘ significant and effective ’ changes had been put in place			0
@entity13 ( pictured ) cut an artery during the operation and subsequent internal bleeding was not picked up the coroner said she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any of the many errors identified contributed to the death			1
‘ i can not find that the actions of any of the clinicians was so bad that it amounted to a criminal act or omission deserving of punishment , ’ she said			0
miss @entity1 ’s family have already settled out of court with the hospital ’s trust for a six - figure sum for medical negligence			0
afterwards , @entity160 , head of medical negligence at @entity162 of @entity17 said : ‘ we would expect the @entity164 to look at this case further to ensure no one else has to go through an ordeal like this			0
‘ it was extremely difficult for the @entity171 family to hear the number of failures which led to @entity1 ’s death but hopefully important lessons have been learned			0
’ a @entity177 spokesman apologised to the family for the ‘ deficiencies in care ’ which contributed to miss @entity1 ’s death			0
‘ the trust has sought to learn appropriate lessons to ensure that such a tragic event never happens again , ’ he said .			0
