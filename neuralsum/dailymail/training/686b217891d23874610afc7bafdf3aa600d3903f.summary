by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 10:29 est , 4 october 2012 archaeologists in @entity2 say they have discovered the tomb of @entity5 @entity4 , one of the great warrior queens of the @entity8 civilisation who was dubbed ' the @entity10 '			1
the tomb , which has lain undisturbed for centuries , was found during excavations of the royal @entity14 of @entity15 , in the sweltering @entity17 jungle region in northern @entity2			1
among a hoard of glistening jade jewels , the archaeologists found in the seventh - century tomb a small alabaster vase showing the image of the queen 's face and inscribed with her name			1
the @entity10 : archaeologists say this tiny alabaster vessel shows a depiction of @entity5 @entity4 , considered one of the great warrior queens of the @entity8 civilisation remains of the great queen : this picture shows the bones of @entity5 @entity4 , who reigned for 20 years over the region and is onsidered the greatest ruler of the @entity8 's @entity38 period ' to discover something of this importance is very unusual , ' lead archaeologist @entity39 told @entity42			1
' she was the supreme warlord of her kingdom			0
' the white alabaster vessel is carved as a conch shell , with the head and arm of an aged woman emerging from the opening			0
the depiction of the woman , mature with a lined face and a strand of hair in front of her ear , and four glyphs carved into the jar , point to the jar as belonging to @entity64 , researchers say			0
a drawing of the glyphs on the back of the vessel researchers say is the name of @entity5 @entity4 the remains were discovered in june but it has taken until now for experts to verify the identity of the queen			1
professor @entity75 , an anthropologist and @entity8 expert working out of the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , said the find was significant because the newly uncovered tomb is a rare situation in which @entity8 archaeological and historical records meet			1
' @entity86 civilization is the only " classical " archaeological field in the @entity88 — in the sense that like archaeology in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 or @entity95 , there is both an archaeological material record and an historical record based on texts and images , ' he added			1
' the precise nature of the text and image information on the white stone jar and its tomb context constitute a remarkable and rare conjunction of these two kinds of records in the @entity8 area			1
' @entity2 is studded with pyramids and ruins from the ancient @entity8 civilization , which thrived between ad 250 and 900 and extended from modern day honduras to central @entity112			2
@entity15 ’ , located approximately 75km west of the famous city of @entity115 , consists of nearly a square kilometre of plazas , palaces , temple pyramids and residences surrounded by many more square kilometres of dispersed residences and temples			0
queen @entity64 ’s portrait has appeared on @entity8 plaques that associate her with the year 692 during the @entity8 classic period , when she ruled the region with husband , @entity129 nevertheless , the discovery of the tomb of the great queen was ' serendipitous , to put it mildly ' , professor @entity75 said , since the team at @entity15 has focused on religious sites rather than burial locations			1
' in retrospect , it makes a lot of sense that the people of @entity15 ’ buried her in this particularly prominent place in their city , ' said professor @entity75			0
relics discovered in the tomb of @entity5 @entity4 : the @entity8 queen was buried alongside a hoard of jade jewels and other artifacts ancient : a stucco polychrome bowl with a lid found at the @entity155 - @entity15 site @entity156 is situated towards the top right of this map of western @entity17 and adjacent parts of of the @entity8 world considered the greatest ruler of the @entity8 's @entity38 period , queen @entity4 is thought to have reigned for at least 20 years between 672 - 692ad , according to professor @entity75			1
the maya civilisation thrived in @entity164 for nearly 3,000 years , but reached its height between ad 250 to 900			0
noted for the only fully developed written language of the @entity168 , the @entity166 also had highly advanced art and architecture as well as mathematical and astronomical systems			0
@entity8 influence can be detected from @entity173 , @entity2 , and western @entity174 to as far away as central @entity112 , more than 1,000km from the @entity8 area			1
the maya peoples never disappeared			0
today their descendants , like the girl pictured above , form sizable populations throughout the @entity8 area			2
they maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs that are the result of the merger of pre-columbian and @entity187 ideas and cultures			0
she was the military governor of the @entity191 kingdom for her family , the imperial house of the @entity194 , and she carried the title ' @entity196 ' - translated to ' @entity197 ' - and was higher in authority than her husband the king			2
historians believe that the community she ruled often battled the powerful king @entity204 and his kingdom @entity115 - just south of the border with present - day @entity112 - where well - preserved ruins are a popular draw for tourists			0
@entity210 , phd , assistant professor of anthropology at the @entity212 in @entity213 , originally began excavating the locale while studying as a doctoral student with professor @entity39			0
continuing to investigate this area this season was of major interest to both because it was the location of a temple that received reverence and ritual attention for generations after the fall of the dynasty at @entity15			2
with the discovery , archaeologists now understand the likely reason why the temple was so revered : @entity64 was buried there , professor @entity39 said			0
@entity2 archaeologist @entity231 said : ' we had made a lot of discoveries of objects making reference to this queen and now to complete it with her remains is very important			2

@entity4 was one of the great warrior queens of the @entity8 and bore the title ' @entity241 ' which is ' @entity197 '
the tomb , discovered in an area of religious significance for the @entity8 people , was revered for generations after the fall of her dynasty
researchers uncover depiction of the aged queen and her remains among hoard of jade jewels deep in the @entity2 jungle
she is one of the few @entity8 historical figures with both a material archaeological record and a written historical record
