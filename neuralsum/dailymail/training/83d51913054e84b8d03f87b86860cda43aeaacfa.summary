by @entity0 these amazing pictures show @entity3 ’s last remaining mud - horse fisherman still at work and determined to continue using the centuries old technique - despite falling profits			1
@entity8 , 56 , is the fifth generation of his family to use the method , which sees him lie on his belly and push a wooden sledge across mudflats			1
the bizarre technique allows him to get to the tide ’s edge where he sticks stakes into the mud and hangs nets between them to catch shrimp			1
@entity8 , 56 , slides to the tide ¿ s edge where he sticks stakes into the mud and hangs nets between them he is the fifth generation of his family to use the method , which sees him lie on his belly sliding over mudflats he learned art from his father , @entity29 , when he was just eight years old mr @entity8 , of @entity30 , learned the art from his father , @entity29 , when he was just eight years old and says he plans to continue for at least another decade			1
his father , who harvested shrimps , eels , cod , sea bass and dog fish , worked for 60 years before ‘ retiring ’ into the family shop			2
but father - of - four mr @entity8 said dwindling numbers of fish and shrimps meant he was now forced to take a night job to make ends meet			1
he said : ' i ca n’t survive on what i make now , it ’s not sustainable like it used to be years ago			0
the supermarkets have come in now and taken all our business away			0
@entity51 , @entity8 's grandfather , shows off his findings aged 16 ( left ) and again at the age of 62 ( right ) tradition : @entity55 , @entity8 's father , is pictured here hard at work at the age of 16 the technique has been practiced for centuries , and two generations ago it was commonplace a mudhorse is a cross between a barrow and a sledge with a flat wooden base and a plank sticking out			1
the base is a wooden cage made up of four poles			0
the fisherman loads it with buckets and kets and pushes it out two miles into the mud when the tide is low			2
to set up the nets at a strategic point , they must have an encyclopedic knowledge of the flats and fish			2
it is then a waiting game			0
when the tide goes out again , there should be a bounty of catch in the nets			2
' we put it down to living next door to @entity92 too , we have lost a good 75 per cent of our shrimp since that was put in			0
' we used to get loads of shrimp years ago , now i ’m lucky to get a basket full			0
' i work nights at @entity99 now to make ends meet			0
that is my income , that ’s what we survive on			0
' i really enjoy mud - horse fishing , i would rather be outside than in a stuffy factory , but that is the reality now			2
' the mud - horse is a hand - built wooden sledge which enables @entity8 to navigate his way over the treacherous mudflats of @entity112			1
the technique was used by many families only a couple of generations ago			0
once he has sledged out and set up the stakes , he simply waits for the tide to wash in and out - flinging fish into the nets			1
mr @entity8 added : ' i was about eight or nine when i first went out , my dad used to put nets down and i would go out and collect the fish twice a day			1
' that shows you how things change			0
@entity29 ( right ) has since ' retired ' to run the family fish shop in @entity30 , selling fish caught by @entity8 ( left ) despite the dwindling number of shrimp in @entity112 , they are determined to continue the trade both found the technique difficult at first but agree that it is worth the effort ' as long as i can i will continue , unless someone like my sister wants to take it over			1
it ’s a young man ’s job now			0
' the senior mr @entity8 , @entity29 , who still prepares fish at the family ’s shop , added : ' i can remember my dad putting me in a basket two miles out , dad chasing a conger eel and me being worried			1
' i can see him now , i was just a titch			0

@entity8 , 56 , is the 5th generation in his family to use the method
