by @entity0 one of @entity2 's biggest financial backers has warned @entity4 independence could be bad for business			1
bus giant @entity6 , run by @entity8 donor sir @entity7 , joins a growing list of @entity4 firms to raise fears over the impact of @entity2 's bid to break up @entity14			1
@entity15 , the @entity16 and @entity17 - whose boss @entity18 was subsequently targeted by cybernats - have all warned about the consequences of a @entity23 vote			1
however , the concerns raised by @entity6 - over the impact on regulation and funding - is particularly embarrassing for mr @entity2			1
only last month , sir @entity7 pledged £ 1million to the @entity8 and has given £ 100,000 to pro-separation campaign group @entity29 for @entity31			1
despite this , @entity6 's preliminary annual report references independence under ' principal risks and uncertainties '			2
it says : ' regulatory changes and availability of public funding - there is a risk changes to the regulatory environment or changes to the availability of public funding could affect the group 's prospects			1
sir @entity7 last month pledged £ 1million to the @entity8 and has given £ 100,000 to pro-separation campaign group @entity29 for @entity31 ' such changes may arise as a result of the outcomes of the september 2014 referendum on @entity4 independence and / or the 2015 @entity14 general election			1
' unionists seized on the comments as proof that even the most committed supporters of independence recognise the economic risks			2
@entity61 , shadow business minis - and @entity64 mp for @entity65 , said : ' when even @entity7 , who has bankrolled the @entity67 for years , thinks separation is a big risk , you know @entity2 has a problem			1
this intervention drives a coach and horses through the @entity67 ' case for separation			0
' breaking up the @entity14 would be a big risk for @entity4			0
@entity6 is right to highlight the risk separation poses to public funding in @entity4			2
' when @entity2 ca n't even tell us the basics like what would replace the pound , how pensions would be afforded or what would happen to funding for our schools and hospitals , it 's no surprise the majority of @entity4 are saying no thanks to separation			1
' mr @entity61 added : ' being part of the @entity14 single market works well for firms like @entity6			0
@entity4 employers have access to a market of 63million people across the @entity14 , rather than five million people in @entity4			0
where is the sense in putting up barriers between @entity4 firms and their customers based elsewhere in the @entity14 ? ' @entity4 @entity107 deputy leader @entity106 said : ' surely it 's ironic for @entity7 to wager an each way bet , mouthing off and bankrolling @entity110 on the one hand , despite it seems , his views as the public face of @entity6 being far from representative of the very company he has built from scratch ? ' @entity4 and @entity6 realise independence is a one - way ticket to a poorer nation			1
' the concerns raised by @entity6 - over the impact on regulation and funding - is particularly embarrassing for first minister @entity2 , who yesterday posed for selfie with former pupil and apprentice @entity127 , at @entity128 in @entity129 wrangling over the crucial tv debates between @entity2 and @entity131 continued yesterday amid a farcical row over dates			1
both sides have now accepted invitations from @entity136 and @entity137 , but not to the same programmes			0
better together originally agreed to a live showdown on july 16 with @entity137 , although mr @entity2 said he would only take part if it involved prime minister @entity141			1
he insisted a debate with mr @entity131 must wait until after @entity144 's @entity143			0
@entity137 agreed to ' review ' the proposed date as a result and august 5 has now been accepted by the first minister 's camp			0
however , @entity151 chiefs are furious that mr @entity2 has been able to dictate the timing , with @entity8 strategists thought to be desperate for a contest closer to the referendum in the hope of receiving a bounce in the polls			1
the @entity160 campaign has therefore not agreed to the august 5 switch , but has accepted an invitation from the @entity136 to take part in a separate show on august 12			0
to confuse the matter further , the @entity8 has yet to accept the @entity136 's offer			2
a @entity151 spokesman said : ' we are glad the @entity136 have begun serious discussions with both sides			0
@entity4 @entity172 leader @entity171 said : ' when it comes down to the nitty - gritty of his business , even @entity7 recognises the risks of independence			1
' the questions on @entity2 's independence plans are stacking up day by day			1
' with concerns now coming from their strongest supporters , the @entity67 should give people the facts they deserve on issues like set - up costs , @entity187 membership and currency			2
' the overall @entity6 report is encouraging for the company , with an operating profit of more than £ 200million , an increased share price and a reduced debt			2
chief executive @entity194 said : ' in the @entity14 , we have placed record orders for new vehicles at our regional bus networks in 2014 - 15 , a sign of our confidence in continuing to get people out of their cars and back on board the bus			2
' yes campaigners played down the significance of @entity6 's intervention			0
@entity208 , executive chairman of pro-independence group business for @entity4 , said : ' @entity7 is on record as a business leader who will vote @entity23 , so we can build a more prosperous economy and fairer society			1
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' we ensure our investors are aware of relevant matters affecting our business , both risks and opportunities			0
' this section of our preliminary results makes the point that our business operates in an environment which can be subject to political change			0
' it highlights the september 2014 referendum on independence and the 2015 @entity14 general election as events which could result in change			0
' it is not a comment on the merits of @entity4 independence , which we have consistently stated is a matter for the people of @entity4 to decide			0
@entity6 remains neutral on the issue			0
' a @entity240 spokesman said : ' investment in @entity4 is booming in the run - up to the referendum , underlined by the @entity245 attractiveness survey showing foreign direct investment in @entity4 last year reached its highest level for 16 years and @entity110 retained its position as the top @entity14 location for inward investment outside @entity251			2
' an independent @entity4 will be a hugely attractive place to do business and invest in			0
