identified : the ' @entity0 ' who said he lived in a @entity2 wood for five years is actually @entity3 and only left home five days before his ' discovery ' the @entity6 - speaking ' @entity0 ' who said he lived in a @entity2 wood for five years is actually @entity3 and only left home five days before his ' discovery ' , it has been claimed			1
@entity2 police said the man 's stepmother had identified the ' boy ' , who had called himself ' @entity13 ' and said he had been living rough with his father in the wilderness before wandering into @entity16 in september , as being called @entity0			1
he is 20 - years - old , and not 17 as he had previously stated , and went missing from his home in @entity18 , near the @entity2 city of @entity20 , less than one week before he told his story			1
friends also said he left home because of ' personal problems ' and to ' start a new life '			0
officers said @entity0 's family identified him from pictures released earlier this week			2
a source said : ' we have spoken to his family and his friends and we have seen a photo where he has a chain with his name on which confirms who he is			0
' this was a mystery for us and we are pleased that it has been solved			0
' a @entity18 police spokesman added : ' we are very happy that he 's been found			0
' we are 100 per cent certain that we are dealing with the 20 - year - old boy , who his stepmother unambiguously identified			2
' and they warned that , if the incident proves to be a hoax , then @entity0 may face a substantial legal bill for wasting police time			1
@entity49 spokesman @entity48 told @entity50 : ' it was a really frustrating case and took up a lot of time			0
that will have to be paid for and that will eventually end up at his door			0
' ' it 's not longer a joke			0
if the story is made up then he deliberately took us for fools , and he could be liable for the costs			0
' police had already worked out that the boy was not a native @entity6 speaker and estimated that he was about 17			2
but he had refused to allow his photo to be issued to the world which meant that officials had not been able to come further in identifying him			0
according to @entity2 news agency @entity72 , @entity71 was last seen in @entity18 on september 2 , 2011 , ahead of taking a trip to @entity16 with a friend			1
this was just days before he appeared at the city hall as ' @entity0 '			2
possessions : @entity13 's rucksack , which was on him when he was found equipment : the boy , who called himself @entity13 , ( right ) was carrying a sleeping bag ( left ) more pictures have emerged of @entity0 since his unmasking a school friend told @entity3 broadcaster @entity86 : ' i am certain that is @entity0			1
he had personal problems and that was his way of beginning a new life			0
' earlier this week , @entity2 police released the first picture of ' @entity0 '			1
they had been unable to identify him since he emerged in the @entity2 capital last september , and issued his picture in a bid to jog people 's memory and maybe throw up some leads			0
the ' boy ' said his father called him ' @entity13 ' and that he was born june 20 , 1994 , but claimed not to know his last name or where he is from			1
he said his mother , @entity107 , died in a car accident when he was 12 and after that he and his father , @entity109 , took to the forest			0
accommodation : the tent which @entity13 was apparently using when he was in the woods left without a word : the house of the father of the ' forest boy @entity13 ' in @entity18 , the @entity3 @entity118 , the school where ' forest boy @entity13 ' studied in @entity18 : friends there told @entity3 media that he had personal problems and his disappearance and reappearance was ' his way of starting a new life they wandered using maps and a compass , staying in tents or caves overnight , he added			2
and he told authorities that after his father died in august 2011 , he buried him in the forest and then walked five days north before ending up in @entity16 , and showed up at city hall			1
investigators had been unable to confirm any details about a fatal car accident that matched up with @entity13 's story , however , and were n't able to find the body of the father - raising ' serious doubts ' about the story			1
wandered : @entity13 is said to have walked into @entity16 after five years in the woods			1

called himself @entity13 and said he *'d* been living rough in @entity2 wood
claimed he was 17 - years - old and his father had died in wilderness
turned up in @entity16 *pleading* for help , saying he did n't know who he was
but stepmother says he is actually called @entity0 and is 20
was actually last seen just five days before he turned up in @entity16
if proved to be a hoax , police warn he could be *prosecuted* for wasting time
