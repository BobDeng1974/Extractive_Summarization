@entity173 , a @entity17 ranger who is from south @entity9 , said : ' when i think of @entity8 i think of the golden sand and rolling @entity177 waves			1
' somewhere that i spent a lot of time when i was growing up , it 's a place that means so much to so many			0
' as someone whose heart and soul is connected to this very special stretch of coastline it would be amazing if the @entity17 could raise the money to buy @entity8 beach and @entity37 estuary			1
@entity194 - managing director of @entity195 based in the famously wealthy @entity197 community of @entity198 discussed the property with his colleagues in @entity202 office and they were ' very interested ' @entity203 : the @entity8 cliffs , which could soon be sold off to developers there are fears that the are could be sold to developers , as well as rumours that a number of @entity202 billionaires are interested in the estate a @entity8 resident told reporters : ' people are nervous , of course they are ' ' i would then know that my children and children 's children would be able to have the same experiences that i had growing up , and that everyone will be able to enjoy this special place forever			2

' it would be very nice if everyone could get together to preserve @entity8 and to protect it for our heritage , but at the end of day - if it is up for sale then someone 's going to buy it and if it was to be sold to wealthy @entity202 it could be better than if it was sold to some @entity3 institution , ' said mr @entity194			2
' a developer might look at it and say : " let 's knock it all down and turn it into some kind of holiday place " , ' he added , saying that many @entity202 had a special empathy and love for the @entity3 way of life			0
some local scamps have adapted the ' please drive carefully ' message in the village the island inspired @entity51 when she wrote @entity267 , as well as the @entity270 mystery @entity268 the current owners have ensured the popular area has remained unspoilt			0
