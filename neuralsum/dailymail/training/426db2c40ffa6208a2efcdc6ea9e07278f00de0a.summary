by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured , described the case as ' very sad ' while sitting in the court of appeal twin five - year - old girls who effectively have three mothers are at the centre of a fierce custody battle between the two lesbians who brought them into the world			1
the children live with their birth mother but were conceived from eggs donated by her ex-partner – and later adopted by her current partner			1
under the @entity17 , the egg donor has no legal status as a parent			1
but she is fighting for a shared residence order which would allow her part - time custody of the girls – and would recognise her as a third legal guardian			0
the court battle prompted warnings over informal sperm and egg donor agreements and concern over the effect on the children			1
@entity34 , of the @entity35 , said : ‘ this is a disturbing harbinger of things to come			1
these kinds of cases will continue to rise as the number of people seeking egg and sperm donation increases			2
in this situation , the mothers appear to have deliberately created a situation where the parentage of the children is malleable			0
the twins now have a birth mother , an adoptive mother , a biological mother and an anonymous father , who they can have no contact with until they are 18			1
it is hugely confusing for the children			0
‘ too many of these kinds of egg and sperm donor arrangements are done informally , with no concrete decisions made about what role the different parents will play			1
’ a court heard the birth mother and genetic mother had an ‘ intimate relationship ’ after meeting in the 1990s and continued to live together after their relationship became platonic			1
when one of them struggled to conceive , the other agreed to donate her eggs , which were fertilised using an anonymous sperm donor in 2007			1
but when relations soured in 2012 and the genetic mother moved out , she found she was not recognised as the twins ’ legal parent			0
the girls continued to live with the birth mother and she later entered a civil partnership with another woman , who was subsequently made a legal parent of the twins by the courts			1
in the first hearing in the custody case , at @entity85 last august , judge @entity82 ruled in favour of the birth mother , saying the egg donor was ‘ not a parent of the children and that her status should not be elevated in that way ’			1
she raised concerns about how the egg donor ‘ would operate her parental responsibility if given it ’			1
but she challenged the decision in the @entity98 , insisting she had a right to look after the twins			0
she argued she had raised the girls for the first few years of their lives when she was still living with the birth mother , who had returned to work			1
in march , three judges upheld the appeal , claiming the initial judgment had been built on ‘ wobbly ’ foundations and the full evidence had not been heard			0
the three - judge @entity98 has sent the case back to @entity85 for a fresh hearing the case will now be sent back to the county court for a fresh hearing			0
@entity1 [ @entity115 ] @entity1 , sitting at the @entity98 , said : ‘ childhood is over all too quickly and , whilst i appreciate that both sides think they are motivated only by concern for the children , it is still very sad to see it being allowed to slip away whilst energy is devoted to adult wrangles and to litigation			0
’ to further complicate the case , the genetic mother used some of the embryos that were created to conceive the twins to impregnate herself			2
it means her toddler daughter is a full sibling to the twins			0
mrs @entity34 said that donors should be aware that they have no automatic parental rights over the child , adding : ‘ more and more cases like this are coming through the courts			0
‘ the focus seems to be what rights the parents have rather than the children ’s rights to their biological heritage			0
’ the number of single women opting to use @entity143 has more than doubled in five years , from 259 to 632 in 2012			0
use of donor sperm has also become popular , with 468 women choosing that route to motherhood in 2012 , according to the @entity149			2
but family solicitor @entity150 said people were often not aware of the complex legal issues surrounding surrogacy and egg and sperm donation			2
‘ people must go into these kinds of agreements with their eyes wide open , ’ he said			0
‘ if someone agrees to donate their eggs or sperm when they are not in a relationship , then it becomes an arrangement , and i think some people go into these arrangements too lightly			2
‘ while everybody enters into these agreements with the best intentions , many do n’t fully consider how the childcare will work in practice			0
’ mr @entity150 said sperm donors must be aware that as the biological father they could be liable for child maintenance .			2
