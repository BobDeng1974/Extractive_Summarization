@entity0 has been recalled by @entity1 despite the fact manager @entity2 knew he had become ‘ reticent ’ to play for the under 21 team			1
at 22 , @entity0 is still eligible for @entity5 ’s @entity4 even though he has not been selected for more than a year , since pulling out of a squad for games against @entity8 and @entity9 in september 2013 , a year after winning his only senior cap to date			1
‘ i believe @entity5 spoke to him and he was reticent , maybe , to play in a game or two , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ as a result @entity5 chose other people , as he ’s quite entitled to do			2
if he did turn him down he would n’t be the first			0
i ’ve had people turn down first - team national places , which i ’ll keep to myself			0
@entity0 has been recalled to the @entity1 squad by manager @entity2 @entity2 says @entity0 was ' reticent ' to play for the @entity20 21s ‘ it may well be that @entity0 , having already played for the first team , might have felt that being asked to play for the @entity23 was stepping back down after , in his eyes , stepping up			1
’ @entity2 worked with @entity0 at @entity25 and gave the midfielder his full @entity1 debut in a @entity29 qualifier against @entity30 in october 2012			1
he was an unused substitute four days later in @entity31 , a game which was delayed by a day due to rain in @entity34			0
he was then named in a squad for a friendly in @entity37 in november 2012 , only to withdraw with a thigh injury , and was not named in the senior squad again until thursday			0
@entity0 won his 13th cap for the @entity23 in a friendly with @entity42 last year in between , @entity0 dropped back into the under 21 squad , winning his 13th @entity45 cap in a friendly against @entity42 last year when @entity2 was in charge during the void between @entity49 and @entity5			1
he played very well against the @entity50 and it seems was not entirely happy to find he had not been promoted back to the seniors a month later , and left staff with the impression that he felt more experience at @entity45 level was not going to help his development			0
@entity0 insists he never refused to play for @entity1			1
he has played through the ranks for the @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 and , on thursday , spoke of his delight at being back in the senior squad			0
@entity0 worked with @entity2 during their time together at @entity25 ‘ it ’s fantastic to be called up by @entity1 at any level , but to be called up to the senior side is a very proud moment for me , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ a lot of it is down to @entity70 and the coaching staff here at @entity73 with the way they have got us playing			2
we ’ve earned a lot of praise for that			0
during the last international break there was only about eight of us here training , so it ’s a credit to everyone at @entity73 for earning international recognition			2
’ when he initially left @entity0 out last @entity86 , rather unconvincingly , said : ‘ i had a feeling he might be with the seniors anyway , so i did n’t want to necessarily pick a player that i did n’t think would be with us for long			2
’ @entity5 turned to other options after @entity0 was selected for the senior squad after @entity0 ’s withdrawal from his squad last year , @entity5 quickly turned to other options in midfield and his side won their qualification group in style			1
they will secure a place at next summer ’s @entity103 in the @entity104 if they can beat @entity105 in a two - legged play - off			0
@entity0 has started the new campaign in terrific form for @entity73 and was disappointed not to be part of @entity2 ’s first squad of the season , when midfielders @entity112 and @entity114 were picked , but @entity2 does not have such a wealth of available players that he can afford to take a stance on a point of principle			1
@entity120 has been called up to the @entity1 senior squad for the first time @entity0 was called up for the games against @entity30 and @entity125 — along with @entity126 ’s @entity120 — and @entity2 added : ‘ i know his qualities as a player as i worked with him and now it ’s a good moment to come into the squad and show me , “ this is where i belong ”			1
’ @entity132 and @entity133 will return to the @entity45 squad after recently winning their first senior @entity1 caps			0
@entity2 said : ‘ we have made it clear to the players that just because you have been asked into the senior national squad that does n’t mean you will never play for anyone else			2
@entity132 could play for the @entity143			0
‘ our players must have the humility to understand they play where we think it is best			0
we will also take great consideration of their feelings because we do n’t intend to ride roughshod over anyone			0
