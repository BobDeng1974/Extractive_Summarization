@entity0 yesterday vowed to prop up @entity1 in @entity2 – even if he loses the election			0
in her most extraordinary offer yet the nationalist leader called on the @entity7 leader to help her ‘ lock ’ @entity9 out of @entity2			1
and crucially , she said the offer stood ‘ regardless of who is the biggest party ’ in the @entity12			0
miss @entity0 ’s latest offer came amid continued fallout from claims she told a @entity26 diplomat she wanted @entity9 to remain as prime minister			1
the report of the conversation , on february 26 , between @entity30 and @entity31 , the @entity26 ambassador , was contained within a @entity34 memo leaked to the @entity35			1
the claim was denied both by the @entity26 embassy and @entity30			1
miss @entity0 also denied a separate claim in the memo that mr @entity1 is ‘ not prime minister material ’			2
it undermines the @entity44 leader ’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with @entity7 to keep the conservatives out of office			1
the @entity44 ’s opponents say it would favour another @entity14 - led government , against which it could campaign in an attempt to make an ‘ out ’ vote more likely in another referendum			2
in an article for the @entity55 addressed to mr @entity1 she wrote : ‘ if together our parties have the parliamentary numbers required after 7 may , and regardless of which is the biggest party , will he and @entity7 join with us in locking @entity9 out of @entity2 ? ’ @entity1 has ruled out going into @entity61 with @entity44 but has not rejected the prospect of working with them chancellor @entity64 said the prospect of the @entity44 propping up the @entity7 in power was an ' alliance between a party that wants to bankrupt the country and a party that wants to break up the country ' her comments heaped pressure on @entity7 to rule out any deal with the nationalists			1
@entity7 has ruled out a formal coalition with the @entity44 but has refused to say if it would enter a looser agreement on policy areas to stay in power			1
@entity14 chief whip @entity81 said : ‘ my concern is that if the @entity44 win the number of seats they are projected to , they could hold the balance of power and hold @entity7 leader @entity1 to ransom			1
’ miss @entity0 is calling for a £ 180billion debt - fuelled public spending spree and an end to the @entity93 nuclear deterrent			0
former cabinet minister @entity94 told @entity95 ’s @entity96 he said : ‘ it is a curious plea being made by @entity0 and the @entity44 : vote anything except @entity7 to get a @entity7 government			1
that makes no sense at all			0
’ a @entity102 poll released yesterday put the @entity44 , on 45 per cent , with @entity7 on 29 per cent			1
if repeated across @entity104 , the poll findings suggest the @entity44 would win 29 of the 41 seats won by @entity7 in 2010			1
a @entity107 reporter said he suffered an onslaught of ‘ vicious abuse ’ from @entity104 nationalists simply for asking @entity0 about the claims that she would prefer @entity9 to remain as prime minister			2
@entity104 correspondent @entity113 was called ‘ @entity114 ’ and ‘ lying scum ’ by @entity44 supporters on @entity117			2
one wrote that mr @entity113 was ‘ in the gutter ’ and trying to ‘ hide his @entity44 hatred ’ , while another accused him of being a ‘ typical @entity107 / @entity122 mouthpiece ’			2
on saturday mr @entity113 wrote on the site : ‘ what an extraordinary level of vicious abuse i have received today for simply reporting the news			0
is this the country we want folks ? is it ? ’ he added : ‘ of course there are some @entity44 strategists – i know , i ’ve spoken to them – who say in private a @entity14 victory would hasten independence			0
‘ of course i should ask tough questions of politicians			0
this is my role in it			0
and finally if , despite my 23 years of reporting things straight , you think i simply make up conversations then do feel free to unfollow me			0
’ miss @entity0 later praised mr @entity113 in an apparent attempt to calm the situation			0
she tweeted : ‘ @entity113 is one of the best journalists in @entity104			0
tough but scrupulously fair and a consummate professional			0

@entity44 chief says she would work with @entity7 regardless of election result
she *challenged* the @entity7 leader to agree pact to ' lock @entity9 out '
comes after claim she told @entity26 diplomat she wanted @entity9 as *pm*
official @entity162 probe was ordered after she *dismissed* memo as untrue
