by @entity0 heroic firefighters are usually pictured saving children or kittens , so this @entity5 rescuer may have got the wrong end of the stick			1
the man cradled a flaming propane tank in his arms to save it from destroying a restaurant			2
in a surreal video , a second firefighter trailed behind with a limp hose but missed completely and doused his already distracted colleague with water			1
it was uploaded to @entity30 and @entity31 and has been viewed more than 25,000 times			0
it shows the firefighter carrying the propane tank out of a restaurant , most likely to save it from setting the rest of the building on fire			1
crews linger inside among the tables as the flames light up the room before one firefighter - brave , stupid or both - takes the drastic action to bring it outside			2

destroyed : from the video , the building already appeared to be damaged as the tank burned inside all safe : the firefighters quickly regained control of the situation and two of them gripped the hose the video provoked a storm of debate about firefighting tactics among online commenters			1
one said : ' @entity66 would be charging into a burning building to save orphans			0
stupidity would be hand - carrying a flaming propane tank to save what appears to be a fire - gutted restaurant			2
' but another pointed out the valves fitted to propane canisters would mean the firefighter was relatively safe			0
the viewer wrote : ' the tank ca n't blow , as the gas keeps being pushed out by the pressure , meaning the fire ca n't get in the tank through the valve			0
