this gold is my medal ' , before going on to say that he would beat @entity5 next			1
in a classic @entity3 versus @entity25 last - 16 clash in front of an enthusiastic crowd , @entity22 boy @entity5 , fighting for the first time after getting a first - round bye , had to fend off the hometown fighter in the first round and did so at times with some assurance as punches were exchanged but after three pulsating rounds , @entity31 was given the unanimous decision			1
confident : @entity2 has the flyweight @entity8 title in his sights after beating @entity5 the verdict did not impress the @entity25 , who said : ' it is what you expect			1
now he is the golden boy			2
' i am not one who says i got robbed but i really thought i won it , i thought i did enough but that 's the way it goes , we are in @entity3			2
' however , @entity31 claimed his take on a boxer 's body language again confirmed the decision			2
going all the way : @entity31 takes a punch from @entity5 but after beating him he wants to win gold he said : ' i knew i beat those two boys by them looking away			1
when my eyes were constantly on them they were looking away , looking at the referee , not wanting to know			0
' that 's when they are beat			0
i have noticed that with guys who have beat me or given me my toughest fight , they look at me square on , right at me			0
' those two boys did n't do that			0
but it does n't matter if you stare at my eyes , i am still going to beat you anyway because i am the fittest i have ever been in my life and i am ready for a gold medal			1
' vocal support : @entity5 thought @entity31 benefitted from the support of the partisan crowd expanding on his view of the decision , @entity5 said : ' it is what it is , you are in @entity3 , you are in his back yard , with all that crowd cheering			1
' i thought i won but in front of this @entity3 crowd i would have had to done a right number on him			0
' i thought i won but that 's the way it goes , it is boxing			0
you get that all over the world , wherever you go , in everyone 's backyard they ( the local boxer ) always get a bit of help			0
but i am a good sportsman			0
