the packaging musters up images of a rustic @entity3 market , with mouthwatering salamis nestling in baskets and signs poetically advertising all manner of delicious treats			1
at least that 's what @entity10 hoped when it created the design for its @entity13			2
except the food giant forgot to check what was really written in @entity3 on the signs that feature prominently on the microwaveable meal			1
@entity17 means ' the balls of grandad ' and @entity20 means ' donkey 's b * * * * * * * '			1
tasty ? the signs feature on the side of the packaging for @entity10 's @entity26 the picture as it appears on the side of the @entity26 packet @entity10 admits the Â£ 3 meal with the offending packaging has been on store shelves across the @entity33 for ' a long time '			1
it insists photograph was taken in a genuine @entity3 market , but admits the words were n't checked by a translator			1
amazingly , the cheeky picture went unnoticed until it was recently spotted by an @entity3 - speaking customer			2
they confirmed the other words innocently describe wild boar , buck , deer and goose meats , but revealed the naughty truth about @entity47 and @entity48			2
' @entity50 's b * * * * * * * ' is regarded as a serious insult in @entity3 , while ' @entity53 's balls ' is actually a cheeky slang term for a long and nobbly salami sold throughout the country			1
nevertheless , @entity10 admits the photo should never have appeared on supermarket shelves			2
a spokesman told @entity60 : ' we can only apologise for any offence caused to our @entity3 - speaking customers			0
' the photo in question was taken at an @entity3 food market and the signs were clearly written by someone with an interesting sense of humour			1
' we will make changes to the packaging at the earliest possible opportunity			0
' oops : @entity10 admits the product has been on shelves for ' a long time ' @entity10 are n't the first big corporation to find naughty messages hidden in the packaging of their products			1
drinkers were shocked to discover they could read ' sex ' spelled out on promotional cans of @entity85 , released back in 1990			0
the subliminal message was only revealed when the cans were stacked one on top of the other			0
drinkers were shocked to find a secret message hidden in cans of @entity85 skittles encountered similar embarrassment when they released their berry explosion version - a conveniently placed 's ' turned explosion into ' sexplosion '			0
and coffee - lovers who were around when java giant @entity100 first launched in @entity101 in the 1970s may remember the saucier version of their famous logo			0
zoomed - out , you can see the @entity100 mermaid is actually holding her scaly legs apart in a suggestive pose			0
a conveniently placed 's ' turns @entity108 to ' @entity109 ' an older version of the world famous @entity100 logo reveals the mermaid is holding her legs apart in a suggestive pose			0

packaging features signs from an @entity3 market advertising ' @entity48 ' and ' @entity20 '
they translate as ' the balls of grandad ' and ' donkey 's b * * * * * * * '
@entity10 apologises , admitting ' we did n't check translation '
