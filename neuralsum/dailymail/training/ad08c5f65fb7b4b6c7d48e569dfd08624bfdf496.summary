by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 02:40 est , 29 august 2012 a woman who has been married eight times has appeared on @entity3 to discuss her colourful love life - and to make an impassioned plea to find husband number nine			1
@entity7 has had eight weddings over a 39 year period - all of which have ended in divorce			1
now says she just wants to find mr @entity12			2
' he 's out there looking for me now , ' she jokes			2
asked if she is a hopeless romantic , @entity7 , from @entity16 , near @entity17 says revealingly that she just sees the good in everyone			1
' i see the good in everyone ' : @entity7 attempts to explain why she has had so many husbands as she appears on the @entity3 sofa with @entity23 and @entity24 ' of course in the past i 've asked myself , is it me or is it them ? ' she confesses			1
' when it was younger , it might have been me			2
i was boisterous , rebellious			2
' but the truth is , i wear my heart on my sleeve			2
i had no idea there were bad people out there - and i learned the hard way			1
' @entity7 is frequently dubbed @entity40 's answer to @entity41 by locals and in the press - something she says she used to find very difficult			1
' at first that was upsetting , ' she says			2
' until my brother turned around and said , " she was voted the most beautiful woman in the world " then i thought , come on , it 's not so bad , ' @entity7 says			1
suggesting that @entity7 must be a ' magnet ' to men , @entity23 , interviewing @entity7 alongside his wife @entity24 , asks whether she would be satisfied simply dating these men , instead of marrying each one she meets			1
happy childhood : @entity7 says the strong marriages of her parents and grandparents fuel her own desire for a happy ending ' you sound like my mother , ' she says			1
' she used to say , " @entity7 , you can date them , you can bed them - it does n't mean you 've got to wed them ! " @entity7 says her parents ' and grandparents ' happy marriages fuelled her passion for romance - and that the paradigm they set laid the foundations for her need to marry			1
' i was married for the first time at 16 , ' she says			2
' you look at your parents , and they 're happy			1
' to me , marriage meant happiness			0
granny and @entity79 : happy			1
' but then looking back , i realise at 16 that was a bit ridiculous			0
' then as time went on , it was morals and scruples			0
we 've all got our own			0
' @entity7 says characteristics her ideal man would possess are honesty and trust			1
' and he should n't look at my outside , ' she says			0
' there is a heart and soul inside			0
' i would n’t look at me twice without make up			0
you have to look at people ’s heart , not their outside			0
incredibly , @entity7 says her string of failed marriages has not put her off men for life			1
' two out of three ai n't bad ! ' @entity23 jokes that @entity7 's good looks and good sense of humour stand in her favour - but she laughs that the fact she is broke does n't help her appeal ' i 'm very aware of not becoming a very bitter person , ' she says			1
' i know i 'm not going to get my 25 years , my big special party			2
' i can barely get to paper ! ' are potential suitors put off to find that @entity7 has been married eight times already ? ' i guess the mind 's not completely closed			1
' i was assaulted in my last relationship			0
i spent three years in bed			2
i thought never , never again			0
' but that 's sad			0
to think you 'll never get that happy ending			1
‘ i ’m an incurable romantic , ' she says			0
' but now i want a man who will look after me for a change			0
' i 'm fed up being the one who does the looking after			0
' i ’ve always been the kind of " mummy " ' , she says			0
does she think she needs counselling ? '' if i went to a psychiatrist , my psychiatrist would go and see a psychiatrist " , ' she jokes			0
' i ’m not normal			0
people do n't see the world in the way i do			0
nobody knows how to deal with me			0
' told that she is a good looking woman , @entity7 laughs			1
' @entity137 will get you everywhere , ' she says - before pointing out that unfortunately her assets end there			2
' i ’m totally skint – broke ! ' she says			0
video : @entity7 told this morning there could be a hubby no.9 ! ...			1

@entity7 , from @entity145 , @entity40 , says she just wants her ' happy ending '
