by @entity0 @entity1 could have been forgiven for wondering what all the fuss had been about			1
a mere nine minutes into his competitive debut , he netted @entity7 ’s first @entity6 goal in four years			1
another swiftly followed to confirm a positive first impression of the summer signing from @entity11 , who hopes to replicate the impact elder sibling @entity15 made in this parish before exiting for @entity17			1
his big brother could have told him , however , that things are rarely that simple when it comes to continental competition			2
delight : @entity7 's @entity1 celebrates his first goal after opening the scoring against @entity26 and so it proved			1
@entity29 ’s side somehow blew the advantage law delivered on a night of immense frustration at @entity32			1
seemingly poised to extend their lead after that early double , the @entity35 runners - up lost direction from the moment @entity40 pulled one back via a first - half penalty			1
the same player then scored again from the spot in injury - time after @entity7 had survived a few second - period scares			1
ultimately , the @entity46 part - timers were worthy of their draw			2
from a position of strength , @entity29 ’s men now have significant work to do in @entity52 next thursday night if they are to remain in the @entity53			1
the draw for the third qualifying round takes place today , but no one at @entity32 will be looking beyond redemption in the second leg of this tie			2
@entity7 had previously gone through seven @entity6 matches — against @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 — without getting on the scoresheet			1
double : law scores his second goal against @entity26 a meeting with @entity26 represented a significant drop in class from those opponents but a much - desired victory remained agonisingly elusive			1
the undulating first half opened on a note of concern			2
@entity29 had spent much of his pre-match deliberations stressing the need to learn from previous @entity6 experiences and guard against being picked off on the break			1
after a mere four minutes , it seemed those words had fallen on deaf ears			2
his side forced a corner which resulted in a @entity89 cross being cleared			2
one crisp pass was all it took for @entity92 to be released into swathes of space on the right			2
his initial cross was overhit but @entity97 gathered on the opposite flank and plonked a perfect delivery on to the head of @entity101			2
his woeful miss from six yards proved the equivalent of an alarm call for the @entity106 line - up			2
suddenly wide awake in their passing and movement , @entity7 claimed the lead after nine minutes			1
it was a landmark goal — after 639 blank minutes in @entity6 — of simple execution			1
@entity112 bullied @entity113 to get on the end of @entity116 ’s looping centre from the right			0
when the downward header was parried by goalkeeper @entity119 , @entity1 had the easiest of tasks to knock into the net			0
it was 2 - 0 10 minutes later after the hapless @entity113 slipped near the touchline			0
@entity125 pinched possession and moved infield , eventually playing a delightful pass to @entity1 inside the area			0
the assist was given the finish it deserved as the midfielder dinked first - time over the despairing @entity119			0
hit the spot : @entity26 's @entity135 slots a penalty past @entity137 @entity7 were looking in ebullient form , with @entity139 passing up a more than presentable chance for a third after @entity142 ’s smart lay - off			1
yet the serene mood inside @entity32 — bathed in sunshine — was fractured 10 minutes before the break			0
@entity147 referee @entity146 pointed to the spot when a firm , deflected strike from @entity151 struck @entity116 ’s hand			0
a booking added insult to his injury			0
@entity40 dithered slightly in his run - up but produced the perfect penalty , tucked just inside the post as @entity137 threw himself in the opposite direction			0
worse could — and probably should — have followed for a previously dominant @entity7 before they were back in the changing room			1
a last - ditch challenge from @entity162 thwarted @entity163 , with @entity137 then forced to thrust out a leg out and expertly deny @entity92 ’s drive			0
nerves were becoming distinctly frayed			0
@entity29 attempted to apply a soothing balm at half - time but the flow of the game remained unpredictable			0
@entity171 saw a firm , low shot well held by @entity119 before @entity26 produced their second glaring miss of the evening			0
@entity92 swept in a terrific cross from the right that found @entity40 ideally positioned			0
yet he somehow sent a close - range volley wide of the near post to answer @entity137 ’s prayers			0
@entity1 had begun to hobble a touch and his impressive debut was brought to an end after 69 minutes when he departed alongside winger @entity89			1
travelling : @entity26 fans celebrate as their side get one back against @entity7 youngsters @entity184 and @entity185 were introduced to the action as @entity7 sought to recapture a spark			1
again , though , it was @entity40 who threatened			0
this time , he was just plain unlucky with a ripping , angled effort that bounced a fraction wide of @entity137 ’s right - hand post			0
he would , though , have his second goal as @entity26 snatched a dramatic leveller in the first minute of added time			1
again , @entity116 was penalised , this time for a foul on substitute @entity197			0
once more , @entity40 was perfectly cool from 12 yards to send a ripple of booing around @entity32 at full - time .			0

law scored a double on his competitive debut for @entity7
he also scored @entity7 's first @entity6 goal for four years
