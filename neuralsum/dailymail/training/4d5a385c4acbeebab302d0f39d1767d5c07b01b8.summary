by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:42 est , 25 february 2014 the world 's largest desk has been installed in the offices of a @entity7 marketing firm at a cost of $ 300,000 , and it even features its own @entity10 account			1
the desk is actually an architecturally designed installation rather than a solid state desk , featuring 1,100 feet of desk space			2
the desk features plywood archways , cubbies and storage space , and is topped with an unbroken surface created by a continuous pour of resin , finished like a surfboard , where over 17 people can sit and work			1
it was designed by architect @entity52 , 59 , and was built into the office of @entity7 marketing firm @entity54 last month			1
the @entity54 said : ' it 's a desk that we could all share , literally			0
slick : the surface is made from a single pour of resin , treated like the polymer of a surfboard the desk does feature drawer space , but was built with the idea that most modern companies only need a place for an employee to rest their laptop the desk is designed to promote teamwork and communication in a business that is supposed to thrive on both , with the unbroken surface allowing people to spread out and share ideas ' 4,400 square feet of undulating , unbroken awesomeness to keep people and ideas flowing			1
' named ' @entity80 ' the structure features a flowing surface which loops and connects to itself , including seven arches for multiple functions			0
mr @entity52 said : ' the design will promote an open working structure , creating small villages within the undulating design			0
friendship required : while the desk does have private areas , it is designed with communication in mind rather than working individually in private one of the desk 's boardroom - style meeting areas , which is completely connected to the same desk as those working on the other side of the office ' traditional desks are coming to an end , as less staff use paper and essentially just need a place to rest their laptop			2
' with each employee having the option of a baby filing cabinet , which can store paper and slides underneath the desk , the @entity54 believe that their snaking workspace , as the @entity10 account states , is " simply the desk			0
. better than all the rest "			0
