on the trip to her mother 's house in the suburbs , @entity7 let her dress do the talking : even though it was in the high 20s and low 30s , the chill did n't stop the 31 - year - old from wearing a form - fitting black and tan sleeveless dress with bare legs and heels			1

earlier this week it emerged that @entity5 , 54 , is dating @entity24 's press secretary @entity7 , 31
