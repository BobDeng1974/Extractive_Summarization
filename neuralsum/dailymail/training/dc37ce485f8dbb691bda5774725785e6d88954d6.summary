a long - lost @entity1 masterpiece that the @entity3 master had with him when he died has been discovered in a private collection , a leading expert on the artist has claimed			1
@entity7 in @entity8 has been copied at least eight times since its completion in 1606 , shortly after the baroque master escaped from @entity13 following his conviction for murder			1
but @entity1 scholar , @entity16 , said she was certain she had found the original after studying the variations in light and colour on @entity7 's hands and face			1
@entity1 's 1606 masterpiece , @entity7 in @entity8 , is believed to have been discovered in a private collection in @entity26 , an expert has claimed the discovery of a handwritten note attached to the back of the painting , attributing it to @entity1 , was further proof			1
she told @entity34 : ' it 's magnificent			2
i knew it right away as soon as i saw it , ' ' i had an immediate , instinctive reaction			0
they laid it down on the floor , i got down on my knees , and when i saw her hands , i said , ' yes , that 's it			2
' the emeritus professor at the @entity50 said key characteristics of the painting left no doubts in her mind regarding its provenance			0
' the creation of a body with varying tones , the intensity of the face			0
the strong wrists , crossed fingers and beautiful hair ... the wonderful variations in light and colour - all show that it is @entity1 , ' she said			1
@entity1 ( left ) , portrait by @entity70 , was a prolific painter and his early work included ' @entity72 ' ( right ) , ' the @entity73 ' and ' @entity74 ' @entity1 scholar , @entity16 , said she was certain she had found the original after studying the variations in light and colour seen in his other works , such as @entity81 ( pictured ) other important clues were the @entity84 customs stamp on the canvas that was only used in the 17th century and the note which said : ' the reclined @entity7 of @entity1 '			1
professor @entity87 did not name the owners of the 100cm by 90cm canvas , saying they did not want publicity			0
' i do n't know if they will exhibit it , ' she said			0
' i think they will keep it in their home and enjoy it			0
after all , if it is sitting in a bank somewhere , no one gets to enjoy it			0
' she called the find a ' marvellous addition ' to the art world and said gazing upon the original was a career highlight			1
@entity109 , 1607 , is one of @entity1 's best - known paintings and exemplifies his fiery style the existence of a version known as the ' @entity114 ' in @entity13 , which some experts have described as authentic , is likely to spark further controversy			1
ms @entity16 told @entity118 she was pressing the owners of the version she authenticated to make it available for some sort of public display			1
' even by @entity1 's standards this is a beautiful and revolutionary painting , ' she said			1

but for now all i can say is that it 's in @entity26			1
' @entity130 , a senior lecturer on art history at the @entity132 , who is also an expert on the @entity135 painter , suggested exercising extreme caution			1

' this might be it , but without seeing the original painting , i would suggest extreme caution			0
' the painting refers to the legend in which @entity7 moved to southern @entity160 , where she lived as a hermit in a cave at @entity163 near @entity164			2
there she was transported seven times a day by angels into the presence of @entity169 , ' where she heard , with her bodily ears , the delightful harmonies of the celestial choirs '			0
