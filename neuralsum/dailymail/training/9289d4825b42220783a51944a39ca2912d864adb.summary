while it may seem like common sense to most passengers , some travellers find it acceptable to act in a manner than others could find annoying			2
former flight attendant @entity7 - who set up a @entity9 website - has revealed the most outrageous habits by flyers in the air			1
from clipping finger and toe nails and changing a baby 's nappy , to wandering around without socks and even having sex - @entity13 labels the behaviour ' disrespectful '			2
top complaint : passengers who remove their shoes during a flight are the number one annoyance passenger shaming : an image shared on @entity7 's website reveals badly behaved travellers 1			1
going barefoot then it comes to hygiene alone , one of the most common offences is people taking off their shoes on a plane - and @entity7 ( not her real name ) counts as her top worst passenger behaviours			1
' it 's an epidemic , ' she tells @entity37			0
' it 's disrespectful and it 's disgusting			0
' @entity7 reveals that nail clipping is an unfortunately all - too - common occurrence on planes 2			1
nail clipping a plane is simply no place to clip your nails or to give yourself a pedicure or manicure - however , this is exactly what @entity13 says she 's seen happening in the air			2
' i once had a passenger treating his warts with @entity54 on a flight ! ' @entity7 said			1
' you 're not in your living room , this is a public airplane ! ' some parents opt to change their baby 's dirty diaper on the seat beside them or the tray table in front 3			0
changing dirty nappies the smell alone would be enough to alienate anyone in close quarters populated by recirculated air - but changing a baby 's diaper on the tray table in front of you ? yes , it really happens			2
' [ the tables ] do n't get wiped down after every flight , ' @entity7 revealed			1
fellow former flight attendant and etiquette expert @entity77 added : ' parents should use the lavatory to change their baby 's diaper			1
' one of the most frequent passenger complaints is about others who eat odorous foods aboard 4			0
eating smelly food it 's a frequent complaint , but so long as you 're not leaving your lunch remains littered across the floor of the aircraft , is this really so offensive ? @entity94 editor @entity93 disagrees			0
' in confined places , each of us has an obligation to limit offensive odours that might be offensive to others , ' she said			0
' you are not at home - save the anchovies for a time when you are			0
' @entity105 : @entity7 revealed that as long as passengers were quick , she generally did n't bother them 5			1
sex on a plane one of the most infamous photos on @entity9 may be of an unwrapped condom found under a seat			0
' sometimes things happen in a dark cabin that 's attempted under a blanket , ' @entity13 said , admitting that she 'd usually quickly put a stop to that sort of behaviour when she was a flight attendant			1
and those passengers looking to sneak into the lavatories and join the @entity105 ? ' i do n't care , ' she said			0
' as long as they 're not bothering anybody , i 'm like " i do n't see anything "			0
' the take home point ? ' always be aware of your surroundings , ' @entity7 says @entity9 was set up in january 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable habits some have adopted while flying			2
the photos , which are submitted anonymously by passengers and flight attendants , are posted to @entity131 and @entity132 and the results are sure to shock			1
there 's people resting their feet near people 's head and on tray tables , as well as people sleeping with their feet in awkward positions			0
but then there 's photos of people changing children 's nappies on tray tables and remarkably leaving them on the floor or in the back seat pocket when they disembark			0
@entity7 is responsible for the page and has been a flight attendant since 2010 .			1
