his grandmother explained : ' they took him to the doctors and that was the first and last time he laughed			2
it 's like he left it for us			2
' the doctor said he had a virus and gave him @entity46 and @entity47 , and said if it gets worse he should come straight back			0
' they went home and put him to bed and he was fine , but in the morning he had a rash from the top of his head to his belly button			2
' my mum did the glass test and called 999 - she was so quick - thinking - it would be easy to think it was chicken pox			2
the death of @entity0 , pictured , has devastated his family , who are unable to comprehend how quickly he fell ill doctors at the @entity19 in @entity20 , pictured , battled to save @entity0 but he later died ' i just remember him having doctors and nurses all around him			1

@entity69 estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the @entity74 and @entity75			2
this means that every day nine people become ill with the disease			2

a further two people will be left with life - altering after effects as severe as brain damage , deafness and multiple amputations			1
symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia : source : @entity69 ' it ’s not right			0
i should have gone first before my grandson			0
