when little @entity2 was brought home from hospital four months ago , a veritable sea of pink greeted her , with clouds of balloons filling the sitting room , along with cards , bunting and ribbons in every shade of girliness			1
for this was a very special event in the @entity15 family			0
when @entity2 was born in october , she was the first girl to be born in her family since 1809			1
the last time a midwife announced ‘ it ’s a girl ’ , the napoleonic war was still being fought , the motorcar was yet to be invented , and ‘ mad ’ @entity23 was on the @entity25 throne			0
oh boy , we 've done it ! @entity28 and @entity29 and brothers @entity31 , nine , @entity32 , seven and @entity33 , three no wonder her proud parents — @entity28 , a 26 - year - old midwife , and @entity29 , a 33 - year - old professional golfer turned coach , from @entity38 in @entity39 — wanted to celebrate			1
‘ when @entity29 and i first got together , he told me how everyone in his family , for five generations , had produced boys , ’ explains @entity28			1
‘ he warned me that the chances of us ever having a daughter were pretty remote			0
’ true to form , when @entity28 became pregnant in 2012 , no one was surprised when @entity33 , who ’s now three , was born			1
looking back over the family tree , @entity28 could see why everyone was so convinced			1
the last girl to be born in the @entity15 family was @entity33 ’s great - great - great @entity53 , born more than 200 years ago in the same year as @entity54			1
@entity55 and her brother had had sons , and so the pattern had continued , all the way down to @entity29 and his brother @entity60			2
@entity29 has two other boys , ten - year - old @entity31 and seven - year - old @entity32 , from a previous relationship , while @entity60 had one son , @entity63 , who ’s 14			1
‘ i even questioned whether there could be a genetic condition that meant @entity29 produced only male sperm , ’ says @entity28			1
warm welcome : @entity2 , pictured with her motehr @entity28 , is the first girl to be born in her family since 1809 ‘ i asked numerous doctors and consultants in the hospital where i work if this was the case , but was told time and again that it was n’t			1
every time a baby is conceived , the chances of it being a girl are 50/50 , they told me — but in @entity29 ’s family , for some reason , it never was			1
’ while it has been long suspected that men who come from families with plenty of males have higher odds of fathering boys , and that for men with many sisters , it is vice versa , there has never been any stong scientific explanation as to why			0
in a study published in the journal @entity95 , the researcher , @entity97 , examined the histories of more than 900 @entity100 and @entity101 families , dating back to 1600 , involving more than half a million people			0
a child ’s sex is always determined by the father			0
while women produce eggs that carry an x chromosome , male sperm cast the deciding chromosome — either an x or a @entity112 mr @entity97 found evidence that men carry a gene that determines the percentage of @entity117 in their sperm			0
one version of this gene produces mostly @entity121 , another mostly @entity122 , and a third yields equal numbers of both			0
but even carrying a gene that predisposes men to more sons or daughters is no guarantee of the sex of a baby — in the same way that rolling a rigged die with a six on four of its faces is no guarantee of landing a six			0
desperate to improve their chances of having a girl , @entity28 came across the @entity141 , developed by an @entity100 doctor in the @entity143 , which claims the timing of conception can help determine the baby ’s sex			1
this is based on evidence that male sperm ( y chromosome ) are faster , weaker and have a shorter lifespan than female sperm ( x chromosome ) , which are slower but survive for longer			0
this means that having sex before ovulation , rather than during , should increase the likelihood of conceiving a girl , as only the female sperm will survive long enough to penetrate the egg			1
@entity28 used ovulation kits to work out when she was ovulating			1
love - making was allowed only early on in @entity28 ’s cycle			1
as soon as the kit showed she was approaching ovulation , intercourse was banned for the rest of the month			0
@entity28 admits it was far from romantic , but says she wanted to give it their best shot			1
surrounded by boys ! @entity2 , who was born in october , pictured with her brothers @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 @entity28 fell pregnant straight away but was convinced the technique had n’t worked and that she was expecting another boy			1
the couple even sorted out all @entity33 ’s clothes into age order ready for when the new baby was born			0
‘ i spent £ 65 on a gorgeous cot mobile with blue and green cars and lorries , and we ’d bought a blue buggy and a blue car seat			0
’ as a midwife , @entity28 has delivered more than 200 babies and admitted to feeling pangs of envy every time it was a girl			1
she says : ‘ i adore the boys , but i ’d write up my notes , while listening to the new mum bonding with her daughter , and be filled with longing , wishing it could be me one day — yet truly believing it never would be			0
’ @entity28 has always been extremely close to her own mum , @entity200 , and craved the same kind of relationship with a daughter of her own one day			2
then , at the 20 - week scan , they received the astonishing news that they were expecting a girl			2
‘ i was in a state of disbelief , ’ says @entity28			2
‘ i kept asking the sonographer if she was sure			0
‘ @entity29 was so emotional he was in tears , crying that it was a gift from his @entity213 — who , sadly , passed away just before i fell pregnant			1
he ’d told us he ’d love a granddaughter			2
’ despite the sonographer ’s assurances , @entity28 spent the rest of the pregnancy struggling to accept that her desire for a daughter really was about to come true			2
‘ i must have had about 16 scans , ’ she says			0
‘ whenever i ’d finish a night shift , i ’d beg one of the doctors to give me another one , just to make sure , ’ she says			0
but it was only when her baby was finally placed on her chest following an emergency caesarean at 39 weeks , that she truly believed it			0
‘ the first thing i asked was : “ is it definitely a girl ? ” ’ and while it ’s often hard to tell the sex of young babies once they ’re dressed , there has never been any mistaking @entity2 ’s gender			1
the little girl has , @entity28 admits , a wardrobe to rival a @entity243 princess , with dozens of flowery dresses , patterened tights , butterfly hairclips , frilly tutus and pink fluffy slippers			2
@entity2 never leaves the house without wearing a headband — pink , of course — and @entity28 has traded in @entity33 ’s blue buggy and car seat for pink ones			1
the nursery glistens with every shade of pink , from the marshmallow rug to the candyfloss chest of drawers and changing table			0
a powder - pink gingham bumper surrounds the cot , teamed with a pink blanket with embroidered hearts			0
the cars and lorries mobile has been replaced by one with pink elephants and giraffes			0
there ’s even a canvas , surrounded by fairy lights , with @entity2 ’s name which lights up in pink — a gift from @entity28 ’s sister , 23 - year - old @entity275			1
she 's a genius ! when @entity29 , 33 , met @entity28 , 26 , he told her their chances of having a daughter were ' remote ' as his family had produced boys for five generations of course , there is still an abundance of cars , tractors , @entity288 , @entity289 and golf equipment around the house			1
@entity28 loves her boys as much as she loves her daughter , but she ca n’t resist the urge to splash out on pretty things , and has sold bundles of @entity33 ’s outgrown clothes on @entity298 to fund her newfound love of all things pink			1
she says : ‘ i know it ’s over-the - top , but i ca n’t resist			0
’ @entity29 is equally besotted			2
‘ he thinks i ’m a genius for producing a daughter , ’ says @entity28			2
with three big brothers to look after her , @entity2 is never going to be short of protectors			2
@entity28 says they are all very protective , but especially @entity33 , who tells people who pick up his precious sister to put her back immediately			2
@entity28 ’s biggest worry now is that her daughter will turn out to be a tomboy			0
@entity29 teases her , saying she ’s bound to end up a professional golfer , but @entity28 already has plans to sign her up to ballet classes on her second birthday			1
‘ i really enjoyed dancing when i was a child , and i ’d love for @entity2 to do the same , ’ she says			2
@entity28 is also looking forward to the days when @entity29 and the boys go off to play 18 holes , and she is able to enjoy shopping trips with her daughter			1
one thing she ’s certain of , though , is that her family is complete			0
‘ if i ’d had another boy , i might have had another shot at a girl			0
but now that i ’ve got one of each , i ’ve got everything i ’ve ever wanted			0
’ @entity28 will never know if her ovulation kits did the trick			2
but whether by luck , or science , the 200 - year @entity15 family boy spell has finally been broken .			0

@entity2 was the first girl to be born in her family since 1809
no wonder her proud parents from @entity38 in @entity39 , wanted to celebrate
when @entity28 , 26 , met @entity29 , he told her his family had only produced boys for five generations
but she became pregnant with a girl after only allowing love - making before ovulation , rather than during , to increase the chances of a girl
