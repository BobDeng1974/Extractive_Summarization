woolly mammoths and other ice age giants may not have been killed off by an asteroid or comet impact , according to new research			1
a study by archaeologists at @entity7 and the @entity8 has cast doubt on a major piece of evidence that is used to support theories that an exploding space rock triggered an abrupt period of climate change at the end of the last ice age			1
they have found that melted droplets of rock and soil , known as scoria , that were thought to have been scattered by the explosion were in fact created by human fires			1
woolly mammoths were once common across @entity27 , northern @entity28 and @entity29 but they vanished around 10,000 years ago at the end of the @entity31 when the climate underwent dramatic changes by studying soil found at stone age archaeological sites in @entity37 , the researchers found the sites were scattered with spherical pieces of melted glass and carbon			1
these are similar to other melted soil droplets that have been found scattered around the globe and were thought to have been caused by a meteorite impact			1
however , they claim that rather than being caused by the intense heat of from such an impact , they were created by much more modest temperatures			0
instead , they say that the melted droplets could have been created by fires in stone age buildings as the soil used to construct them melted			1
there are several leading theories for what killed off the ice age giants like the woolly mammoths			1
woolly mammoths are thought to have roamed the @entity62 from about 200,000 years ago before eventually dying out 10,000 years ago			0
at this time the planet was undergoing a major change in climate that is thought to have led to the shrinkage of their habitat			0
unable to find the food they needed their populations became smaller and increasingly isolated			0
a study in 2008 estimated that changes in climate as a result of the end of the last glacial period saw their habitat shrink from 3 million square miles to 310,000 square miles			2
some researchers have suggested that the spread of forests , which overtook the extensive areas of frozen grassland and tundra where mammoths thrived , led to their extinction			0
the changes in climate also opened up large parts of the northern hemisphere to humans , allowing groups to spread more widely around @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
many blame overhunting by humans for finally finishing off the dwindling populations of megafauna like mammoths			0
more recently some scientists have adopted theories that sudden changes in climate , known as the @entity101 period , left many large animal species unable to cope			2
it is thought this period of cooling may have been caused by the collapse of the @entity27 ice sheets into the @entity108 , leading to the seas cooling dramatically			2
others have suggested this was triggered by a large explosion from an asteroid or comet impact that spread debris around the globe			1
the findings now lend support to other theories for what caused mammoths and other large animals to die out , such as over-hunting by humans and changes to their habitat			1
dr @entity127 , a geologist at the @entity8 and lead author of the study , said : ' there is no evidence to suggest that siliceous scoria droplets result from very high temperature melting of soil and are the result of a cosmic event			0
' a large asteroid or comet impact with the @entity62 is one theories for caused ice - age megafauna to die out researchers studied tiny droplets of melted debris found at archaeological sites in @entity37 and found that they appear to have been created by human induced fires as mud used to construct stone - age homes melted humans are known to have hunted ice - age giants like mammoths and the latest findings lend support to theories that it was the influx of human hunters into the northern hemisphere that led to the extinctions the idea that an exploding comet or asteroid sparked the rapid cooling that occurred 12,900 years ago was first proposed by scientists in 2007			1
an international team of researchers presented data suggesting carbon - rich black layers found in sediments at around that time were caused by a cosmic impact			2
they say the exploding space rock created wildfires , hurricane force winds and lead to the collapse of the @entity27 ice sheets , kickstarting a 1,300 - year period of cold weather and drought known as the @entity178 cooling			1
this lead to many of the large mammals - known as megafauna - that roamed the earth during the @entity31 to die out			2
the same team later claimed in 2013 that the impact spread more than 10 million tonnes of spherules of melted glass and carbon over an area of more than 50 million km across four continents of the @entity62			1
the latest study examined melted soil at archaeological sites around @entity37 and concluded it could not have been spread there by a large global wide explosion but was formed by fires within stone age houses however , the new findings , published in the @entity200 , suggest this evidence may have in fact been caused by the melting of earth in fires created by humans			1
the droplets studied appeared to be composed of material found in the local soil in @entity37 rather than matching soil from elsewhere in the world - which would be consistent with an meteorite impact			1
they argue that earth used for constructing buildings was often made with silica rich materials that could melt at temperatures of around 800 and 1000 Â° @entity219 dr @entity127 added : ' ( our ) findings demonstrate that the presence of siliceous scoria droplets are independent of age and thus are not specific to the beginning of the @entity178			2
' occurrences have not been reported from natural deposits , but are instead associated with buildings destroyed by fire and thus appear to be restricted to archaeological sites			0
' we therefore conclude that melting of building earth in ancient settlements can occur during fires reaching modest temperatures			0
' professor @entity237 , an archaeobotanists at @entity7 who also took part in this work , said : ' i think they are likely to come from uncontrolled fires , as we expect these to reach really high temperatures in some places			0
' controlled fires in hearths and ovens and i guess will often be kept at lower temperature more manageable for cooking			0
' i think the obvious big player in megafaunal extinctions sn humans , human population growth , the modification of environments and the changing of foodwebs			0
' human over-hunting is a somewhat simplistic version of this hypothesis			0
' in the @entity263 the ecosystem space of large herbivores has been mostly replaced by domesticated cattle , sheep , goats , horses and agricultural fields tend to exclude large herbivores			0
' in the @entity271 domesticated herbivores are less significant but the addition of humans only about 15000 years ago must have massively altered ecologies and and food - webs in ways that destabilized large fauna numbers			2
' previous research has suggested that an asteroid impact scattered melted droplets of soil around the globe however , dr @entity283 , from the @entity284 , who was one of the original team to propose that an impact from space triggered the @entity178 period , described the new findings as ' sheer nonsense '			1
he said : ' the melt materials found at the site include materials such as monolith that melt at over 2,000 degrees , substantially higher than can occur in any normal fire			0

scientists believed a large comet or asteroid explosion triggered dramatic cooling known as the @entity178 period at the end of the ice age
*microscopic* droplets of melted glass and carbon from the soil were thought to have been scattered around the world by the impact
new research suggests deposits of these melted droplets were actually formed by fires inside stone age houses build by *prehistoric* humans
the findings lend support to theories that humans may have killed off the giant ice - age mammals by hunting them as they moved further north
