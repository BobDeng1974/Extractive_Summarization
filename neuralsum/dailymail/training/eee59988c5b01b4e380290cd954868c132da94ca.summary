symbols of fish and the sun , as well as intricate pattens of concentric circles and lines drawn by our ancestors , have been found etched into stones on a remote mountain in @entity10			1
archeologists have discovered thousands of stunning stone - age carvings etched into rocks			2
they believe that they were made by our hunter - gatherer ancestors more than 6,000 years ago			0
the etchings are known as petroglyphs and are generally patterns made up of concentric circles and wavy lines , although there are also more representative images of deer tracks			1
a detail of one of 500 stones , which have been found by @entity28 archeologists in @entity29 , @entity31 state , @entity10 archeologists said the characteristics of the carved stones vary depending on their location			1
stones found in the main cluster in @entity38 have etchings of strong points and concentric circles , although there are also wavy and broken lines			1
this image seems to show a fish in the foreground around 8,000 of the historic drawings were discovered and recorded in @entity29 , a site in @entity10			0
so far , 500 decorated stones have been found at the site , which measures two miles in radius and is the most important with so many of these ' petrograbados ' in the @entity28 state of @entity31			2
scientists think the carvings could have been made as part of hunting initiation rites or even represent the stars			1
they could give historians a clue of how sophisticated stone age tribes were in the area and even an idea of the kind of tools they used			1
the stones have around 8000 carved figures and probably have been made by hunter - collectors 6000 years ago the pretroglyphs are scattered across the site and found on different parts of the mountain			2
most of the rock art was found on the southern slope of the mountain , but there were also some found scattered at the foot of the north side			0

there is indication that the tribes were making tools to survive and lived in huts made of perishable materials , which were in some cases portable , he told @entity99 language publication @entity100			0
these ancient rocks were found in @entity29 and cover an area of two square kilometres			0
@entity80 archeologists said that these petroglyphs are believed to come from pre-hispanic hunter - gather groups that frequented the area archeologists have found evidence of camps in two valleys that are separated by a small ridge , with the larger ones located near @entity29 , where the largest group of carved rocks was found			1

the archeologists also found relatively modern carvings of crosses probably made some time in the second half of the sixteenth century			2
the archeological study started in august last year and the @entity135 plans to allow tourists to visit the site where the rocks were found , which lies around 60 miles west of the @entity28 city of @entity140 .			0
