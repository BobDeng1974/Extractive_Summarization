by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:35 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 02:17 est , 28 september 2012 controversial : @entity2 , presented by newsreader @entity3 , has been accused of glorifying the drug ecstasy it was billed as an opportunity for scientists to investigate the impact of ecstasy on the brain			1
but last night critics and viewers accused @entity12 of turning drugs live : the @entity14 into little more than a ratings - grabbing advert for the @entity18 drug			1
they also asked why the only expert to point out the dangers of taking drugs was given just three minutes of the 65 - minute - long programme to voice his concerns			2
the show – billed by the broadcaster as one of its ‘ boldest projects yet ’ – saw 25 volunteers , including a vicar and author @entity31 , take an 83mg tablet of @entity33 – pure ecstasy – or a placebo			2
each then underwent a series of tests , including a brain scan , while changes to their mood , memories and emotions were monitored			0
@entity3 , who is hosting the two - part series , insisted the research was vital because ‘ incredibly , no one knows how [ ecstasy ] works or how harmful it is ’			2
however , many viewers complained that instead of focusing on the science , producers instead merely wanted to talk about the volunteers ’ experiences			0
only one man , a former @entity52 soldier , was shown to have had a negative response , while the majority of the volunteers described feelings of well - being , euphoria , and warmth			1
method : 25 people were given either mdma or a placebo and their brain , articulation and feelings were tested viewer @entity65 wrote on @entity66 : ‘ @entity67			1
it ’s a great advert for e – not what i was hoping for ’ , while @entity72 added : ‘ think everyone is going to be on @entity33 at the weekend after this great commercial on @entity75			0
’ pills : @entity14 is made using the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine , or @entity33 - which critics say is dangerous another viewer wrote : ‘ drugs live has made me want to do drugs for the first time in years			1
’ the trial on wednesday , which operated under a @entity86 licence , was funded by @entity12 and led by professor @entity87 , of @entity88 , and professor @entity89 , from @entity90			1
he was sacked as the government ’s drugs tsar in 2009 for saying ecstasy was less dangerous than horse riding			2
campaigners also pointed out that while just one scientist spoke of the serious risks associated with ecstasy use , both professors were given extra time to discuss their more liberal views			2
@entity103 , of campaign group @entity104 , said : ‘ the whole thing was just an ego trip for @entity89			0
' he is a self - publicist and does n’t seem to be able to bear being out of the limelight			0
it is anything for publicity			0
‘ this is not the way to conduct scientific experiments			0
you do research quietly , conduct it on lots of people , you write it up and publish it in a journal that is peer - reviewed			0
the whole thing was just an advert for taking ecstasy			1
’ she also claimed that while professor @entity124 , one of @entity126 ’s leading experts on ecstasy , tried three times to emphasise the dangers of the drug , he only got around three minutes of airtime			1
experiment : author of @entity133 - @entity31 - is given a pill the programme concluded last night by inviting viewers to share their experiences of taking ecstasy and discuss the long - term effects of persistently using it			1
@entity141 , of drug charity release , said : ‘ the show did talk about potential harms and the panel was reasonably balanced			0
its objective was a scientific study into the impact of @entity33 on the brain and it met that objective well			0
’ a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ the programmes aim to cut through the emotional debate surrounding ecstasy , inform the public about the effects and potential risks of @entity33 , and allow people to discuss the issues raised			1
