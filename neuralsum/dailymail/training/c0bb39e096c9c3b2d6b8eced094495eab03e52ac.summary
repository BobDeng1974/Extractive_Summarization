when the residents of @entity2 took to the streets en masse in late september , it took the rest of the world - and the authoritarian @entity7 government - by surprise			1
one woman who was n't surprised is @entity10 , a 34 - year - old assistant film director who has been involved in the protests since day one and says she will never give up the fight for democracy			1
' the government side has shown little inclination to help the issue , ' she explains in a phonecall from the @entity20 city			1
' things have become tense because there 's no clear direction from them			2
' tough : @entity25 , 34 , has been campaigning for the right to direct elections since the 28th september the protests first exploded into life on the 28th september , following months of anger at the @entity7 government 's refusal to allow directly elected representatives for @entity2			1
although allowing the territory a measure of democracy was specified in the 1997 handover agreement , @entity7 has shown little inclination to fulfill its obligations - leaving locals furious			1
now , the protests , which began as a small student movement , are in their third month - and demonstrators are showing no sign of backing down , despite mounting violence			1
among them is @entity10 , who says she has endured being tear gassed and pepper sprayed during her weeks manning the barricades , while some friends have been beaten up			1
' it was chaotic on the first day , ' she remembers			1
' there was lots of tear gas and pepper spray			1
i was situated on the front line and nobody knew what was going on			0
' the protests , which have become known as ' the @entity62 ' , have waxed and waned since the first demonstrators hit the streets , but exploded into violence on monday			1
on guard : @entity25 and her friends spent the first 45 days living , sleeping and eating at the barricades popular : ms @entity25 said the tradition of democracy was established under @entity72 rule - and they wo n't give it up a day later , the leaders of one of the three protects - @entity76 with @entity77 - announced they would hand themselves into the nearest police station			1
@entity10 has no plans to follow suit			1
' i have n't been beaten up yet but some of my friends have and they 've been arrested , ' she explains			2
' the extent that police will go to exercise their authority is just dreadful			0
when i was little , the @entity2 police represented everything was right and just and now ... it 's just really sad to see the way they 're exercising their right to bear arms and enforce the law			0
' since the protests began , @entity10 's life has been on hold			1
to begin with , she spent all her time at the protest sites , even sleeping there			2
as the days stretched into months , she returned , sporadically , to work and went home to sleep			0
nevertheless , her determination to keep protesting until change comes remains			0
dangerous : many were injured after protesters clashed with police late on sunday night attack : students have endured violence at the hands of fellow citizens who say protesting is bad for business ' i am there with friends and i think wanting to be there , the need to be there is greater than the fear of what might happen to me , ' she explains			1
' a hundred things are going through your mind			0
i do n't know what 's going to happen but we want justice from the government in the matter of the electoral process			2
' the protests , she adds , are the culmination of years of frustration			0
' i think @entity2 is at a point where it 's had enough with all the developments since the handover , ' she explains			0
' all these changes to the everyday lives of the people			0
@entity2 is still at the forefront of freedom , democracy and justice - these were firmly rooted under @entity72 rule			2
' it left us knowing we should speak out when there 's dissent and that 's what we are doing now			0
it has become so tense ( between citizens and the government ) that people ca n't stand back and let things just happen			2
' but not everyone is standing firm			0
residents of @entity162 , one of the poorer districts and one that is crammed with small traders , have attacked protesters , claiming they are bad for business			2
the @entity7 authorities have also stepped up their campaign , unleashing police armed with tear gas and batons on the peaceful protesters and raising fears of a second @entity175			1
frightening : police officers have become increasingly willing to use force on the demonstrators @entity179 : @entity25 says she is disappointed in the way the police have behaved and expected much better no surrender : @entity25 says she and her fellow protesters wo n't give up until they have what they want that incident , which took place in central @entity187 in 1989 , saw student protests brutally crushed by an army of 300,000 men who advanced on demonstrators with tanks			1
no one knows exactly how many died but estimates are between 200 and 2,000			0
@entity10 hopes that the same thing wo n't happen this time			1
' i think the circumstances are different but the underlying issues are there , ' she explains			0
' will it be a repeat of @entity175 ? yes , in the sense that student leaders are there fighting for democracy			1
no because times have changed			0
chillingly , she adds : ' in any revolution bloodshed is inevitable and we 're seeing some of that now			0
but protesters are smart and if more bloodshed happens , then they will be smart about it			2
' should @entity10 and the protesters get their way , the end result will be a democratic voice for @entity2 and @entity10 is hopeful that she will get the result she wants			1
' i 'm really hoping to see some sincerity coming from the government , ' she adds			2
' something to show that they do hear what the people are saying and they are listening			0
' at the moment we do n't see any of that			0
i think unless we see some , the protests will continue			0
' i think our voices will be heard in the end , ' she adds			0
' i do n't think it 's about winning , it 's about making the city better			0
this is how we are showing the government that we 're not happy			2
