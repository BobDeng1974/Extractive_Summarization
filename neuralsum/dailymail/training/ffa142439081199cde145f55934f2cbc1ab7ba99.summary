by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:15 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 20:57 est , 26 march 2013 health secretary @entity2 today told @entity3 that managers who fail patients will be struck off and barred from working in the @entity6 again doctors and nurses could be given pay rises simply for treating their patients with compassion			1
health secretary @entity2 yesterday promised a ‘ radical overhaul ’ of the @entity6 , putting a far greater emphasis on old - fashioned care in the wake of the @entity16 hospital scandal			1
he said one measure could be to introduce a system of pay rises which would see staff rewarded if they show ‘ compassion , dignity and respect ’ when treating patients			0
but patient groups said nurses should not have to be paid extra just for doing their jobs properly			1
@entity29 , of @entity30 , said : ‘ it ’s incredible when you think of the level that nursing care , and medical care in general , has sunk to			2
compassion should be part of doctors ’ and nurses ’ jobs			1
‘ they are quite well paid as it is – they certainly should not be getting more			2
to talk about giving people more money for something they should be doing anyway is wrong			0
’ the pay plans were among a raft of measures announced by mr @entity2 yesterday in the hope of preventing another disaster on the scale of @entity16 , where as many as 1,200 patients died from ‘ routine ’ neglect			1
last month a damning report by @entity56 , @entity57 , warned of a culture of fear in the @entity60 that was obsessed with targets to the detriment of patients			0
it warned that unless major changes were made to the @entity6 , the neglect and horrific treatment at @entity16 would be repeated			0
in his formal response to the @entity56 report , mr @entity2 called the scandal ‘ a betrayal of the worst kind ’			1
he said @entity6 staff would now have a legal ‘ duty of candour ’ to tell the truth about patient care to patients , families and the government			1
hospitals could be fined if they fiddle figures on death rates or waiting times or hide mistakes from patients and families			0
a series of measures will be enforced in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at @entity93 the government is also considering prosecuting individual doctors or nurses who cover up their mistakes			2
hospitals will also face tougher inspections from the @entity100 which could last up to a month			0
they will be rated as ‘ outstanding , good , requiring improvement or poor ’ , in a process similar to the @entity104 system in schools			0
and mr @entity2 said he would work closely with hospitals and @entity108 , the organisation which sets wages , to ensure that pay rises given to staff were linked to ‘ high quality care ’			1
under the current system , thousands of doctors and nurses are given salary increases of up to 8 per cent every few years just for doing the same job			2
hospital doctors earn an average of £ 74,000 a year rising to £ 109,000 for consultants			0
nurses are paid around £ 30,500 a year			1
it is not yet clear how staff would be monitored on the quality of their care but it could be through the new @entity128 test , given to patients after hospital treatment			2
patients are asked if they would recommend the hospital to friends and family			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the events at @entity93 were a betrayal of the worst kind			1
a betrayal of the patients , of the families , and of the vast majority of @entity6 staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high - quality , compassionate care they deserve			1
‘ the health and care system must change			1
we can not merely tinker around the edges – we need a radical overhaul with high - quality care and compassion at its heart			1
’ as revealed by the @entity157 yesterday , student nurses will be made to work for a year as healthcare assistants on wards to give them experience of hands - on care			1
ministers will also appoint a chief inspector of hospitals and a chief inspector of care homes who will rate organisations			2
campaigners , including relatives of those who died at @entity16 said the measures did n’t go far enough			0
@entity173 , who set up @entity174 the @entity6 after the death of her mother , said : ‘ we need safe staffing levels and the correct skill mix , that ’s the start that ’s needed , then we need to look at the training			0
‘ i think there needs to be far more emphasis on who they select to go into nursing			2
we ’ve got staff who do n’t want to work for the @entity6 , we ’ve got patients frightened , older people frightened to go into @entity6 hospitals			0
‘ this has got to change , and it ’s not going to change with this style of leadership , command and control			0
we need much more emphasis on the culture and behaviours of the people within the @entity6 , and that starts at the top			0
