dried - out southern @entity0 got a much - needed sprinkling of rain on sunday , but at the cost of rockslides which trapped more than a dozen cars in mud and shut down 10 miles of the @entity7			1
no one was injured , but the slides raise fears that more damage could be in store when heavier rains arrive on tuesday as part of a storm that has already started hitting northern @entity0			1
@entity16 received 1.4 inches of rain on sunday , which led to slides in nearby @entity20			0
a stretch of the highly - trafficked @entity7 was closed sunday after it became covered in a few inches to a foot of debris and led 10 to 15 vehicles to become stranded in the muck			1
some of the vehicles were extricated , while others were abandoned until the rains stopped			0
officials said the road may not be fully cleaned up and reopened until tuesday			0
now southern @entity46 are bracing for tuesday 's storm , which is expected to be the biggest rainfall to hit the region since last february			1
that storm system is expected to start tuesday morning bring 1 - 2 inches of rain to the coastal and valley areas , and 2 - 5 inches in the foothills and mountains			1
while the heaviest rain will happen tuesday , according to the @entity58 , light showers will continue on wednesday and into thursday			1
next round : more rain is expected to hit the drought - plagued southern @entity0 region on tuesday , with 1 - 2 inches falling in the coastal and valley areas , and 2 - 5 inches in the foothills and mountains eighty per cent of @entity0 is currently experiencing a state of extreme drought , so the rain comes as a godsend for the state 's reservoirs which have been withering the past three dry years			1
however , the drought has also sparked several disastrous wildfires recently which create soil conditions hazardous to mud and rockslides when rain does fall			2
there were more than 5,500 wildfires in 2014 , which is 1,000 more than usual			0
road conditions are also a concern , since dry weather causes oil to accumulate on the road and it can become slick when hit with rain			0
residents in the areas of the recent @entity86 and @entity87 wildfires , which burned up several thousand acres each in the areas of the @entity89 and @entity90 respectively , were put on notice sunday that the rain could cause damage			2
no evacuations have been ordered yet , but residents are being asked to remove vehicles , trash bins and other obstructions from the roadways			0
in @entity101 , which was hit with mudslides just last week , residents stacked sandbags in anticipation for tuesday 's rains , and concrete barriers were set up outside the homes			2
preparations : tuesday 's rains bring the chance of further mud and rockslides , especially in areas where wildfires have recently happened			2
above , residents in @entity101 , @entity0 have lined up sandbags outside their homes shield : concrete barriers are lined up outside a home in @entity101 , @entity0 to protect it from potential mud and rockslides this week @entity16 has only seen a half of inch of rain this year , which is 1.5 inches lower than usual			1
the rain on tuesday could bring the year totals up to normal , but climatologist @entity128 told the @entity129 that ' one storm is not a drought buster '			1
' hopefully it is a small down payment and is a preview of the coming attractions in the next few months			0
@entity0 has been experiencing unusually warm temperatures recently , which may predict an @entity137 weather pattern			0
an @entity137 is the warming of the @entity139 which causes more rain , but climatologists believe if an @entity137 happens it will be relatively weak			0
currently , the estimates of an @entity137 happening stand at 58 per cent .			0

@entity0 was hit with showers on sunday , causing rockslides which shut down parts of the @entity7
no one was injured , but several cars became stuck in the muck
