it 's a sunny october afternoon , and @entity1 , who 's been enthralling audiences for three decades at @entity4 , is engaged in her favorite activity : getting down and dirty in the rehearsal studio , trying to figure things out			1
she swoops high onto her partner 's shoulders , soaring with the music , an otherworldy look on her face			2
then — oops ! — she breaks into giggles when an attempted landing does n't quite work			2
@entity1 , whose famous intensity onstage is belied by her frequent , easy laugh offstage , says she experiences sheer joy in rehearsals like this one			1
maybe that 's because she 's spending it with colleagues she adores , longtime partners @entity4 and @entity26			1
maybe it 's also because at 47 — easily twice the age of many colleagues — she 's in high - level form , having made a remarkable recovery from a hip reconstruction last year that saved her from a potentially career - ending condition			1
retiring : ballerina @entity1 , seen warming up before a rehearsal , is to dance her final performancy for the @entity4 on saturday after 30 years with the company and maybe it 's because she 's ending that ballet career now — on her own terms , and because she 's ready			1
after 30 years with @entity4 , almost to the day , @entity1 dances her final performance saturday , one that 's sure to be marked by tears , hugs , and countless bouquets			1
@entity1 is such a popular figure with @entity4 audiences that the show sold out within minutes			1
' i hope i 'm not nervous , ' @entity1 says of the big night			1
' but i know i will be			2
' and though retirements often are bittersweet affairs — in their implicit acknowledgment of time passing and bodies changing — @entity1 says she has no regrets			1
' nope ! ' she says			0
' it feels absolutely right			0
' things did n't always feel so right			0
about three years ago , @entity1 was pulled — too early , she thinks — from the role of the @entity60 in ' @entity61 , ' which she 'd danced for many years			1
it felt , she says , ' like @entity63			0
' a few months later , she began feeling serious pain in her hip			2
she felt like her heart was influencing her body , and vice versa			0
beloved colleagues : @entity1 seen rehearsing with one of her longtime dance partners , @entity4 , in the @entity72 of the @entity74 complex in @entity75 on pointe : @entity1 , seen rehearsing with fellow principal dancer @entity26 , is in high - level form - despite being twice the age of many other ballerinas @entity1 had certainly dealt with physical adversity before			1
growing up in @entity81 , @entity82 , she was fiercely determined to become a ballerina			0
but her teachers noticed a spine curvature			0
at 12 , she was diagnosed with scoliosis			0
one week a month , she 'd go into the hospital and spend 20 hours a day in traction			2
at week 's end , she 'd be plastered into a body cast			0
even in that plaster cast , @entity1 would attend ballet class			1
' it weighed 15 pounds — i got really strong , ' she says			0
finally , she graduated to a plastic brace , which she wore for five more years			2
at 17 , @entity1 joined @entity4			1
although she missed working with the legendary @entity96 , spotting him only once in a hallway before he died , she worked with another key @entity4 figure , @entity100			1
but she became best known for collaborations with contemporary choreographers , serving as a muse for , most famously , @entity104 and @entity105 — the two most accomplished choreographers in classical dance today			0
' @entity109 and @entity105 , they 've really fed me for the last 10 years — kept me curious and excited and creative , ' @entity1 says			1
perseverance : @entity26 ( pictured ) says that ' for @entity1 , it 's about working , working , working until she gets it right ' @entity104 , in turn , has credited @entity1 for launching his own career , with the 2001 work ' @entity116			1
' four years later , he created ' @entity118 ' for her			2
in its breathtaking @entity119 , she appears — long hair flowing , no pointe shoes , in just a light pink leotard — almost to fly off into the air			0
she 'll perform that work at her farewell , along with pieces by @entity105 , @entity96 and @entity100			0
to finish it off , @entity1 will debut a special piece , created by both @entity130 and @entity105 at her request , with partners @entity4 and @entity26			1
@entity26 credits his partner with teaching him and many others about perseverance			0
' for @entity1 , it 's about working , working , working until she gets it right , ' @entity26 says			1
@entity138 turn : @entity1 performing ' @entity118 ' in 2010			1
in its breathtaking @entity119 , she appears — long hair flowing , no pointe shoes , in just a light pink leotard — almost to fly off into the air just the other night , @entity26 says , he and @entity1 were taking bows			1
' i turned and said , ' i hope you 're having as much fun this season as i am , '' he says			0
' it 's been so wonderful seeing her enjoy herself			0
' @entity1 is definitively not hanging up her dance shoes			2
she 's been moving gradually into modern dance , and is booked solid with numerous projects , including a tour next year with ' @entity154 , ' a series of duets with four modern choreographers			2
that 's what i love , ' @entity1 says			2
but for now , she has to stay fit and healthy for a few more days			0
she 's not overly concerned			0
@entity161 , she says , is with her			0
' i 've paid some big dues , ' she says			0
' i 've earned a good farewell			0

after 30 years with @entity4 , almost to the day , @entity1 , 47 , dances her final performance saturday
the famed dancer made a remarkable recovery from a hip reconstruction last year that saved her from a potentially career - ending condition
