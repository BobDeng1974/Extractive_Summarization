professor sir @entity0 , pictured , has warned of the risks to cross-border healthcare in the event of a @entity5 vote in the referendum a vote for independence would create a ' @entity9 of health ' between @entity11 and @entity12 , the medical director of @entity11 warns today			1
writing exclusively in today 's @entity14 , professor sir @entity0 warns of the risks to cross-border healthcare - with 44,000 @entity12 patients treated in @entity11 last year alone			1
in a separate warning , @entity12 's struggling @entity11 is facing devastating cutbacks of £ 450million under the @entity19 , an explosive secret dossier has revealed			1
the confidential paper seen by the @entity12 @entity14 , kept under wraps in the run - up to the referendum , shows that health board chiefs are preparing to make huge savings in 2015 and 2016			2
sir @entity0 today destroys @entity28 's claims that a no vote could lead to the destruction of @entity12 's devolved public health service , pointing out that ' the people of @entity33 , @entity11 or @entity34 could not privatise the @entity11 even if they wanted to '			1
@entity11 chief executive @entity35 also waded into the referendum debate last night , arguing that a @entity5 vote means a ' bilateral agreement ' may have to be drawn up to allow @entity12 patients access to specialist health services in @entity11			1
that mean hundreds of patients currently on the waiting list could face an even longer delay for life - saving heart , lung and liver transplants			0
even though it has been fully devolved to @entity47 since 1999 , the future of the @entity11 has been put at the forefront of the battle for independence by the @entity19			2
mr @entity28 and his ministers have claimed that voting for separation is the only way to protect @entity12 's @entity11 budget – which can be indirectly affected by health spending in @entity56 - and the spread of ' privatisation ' from @entity59			1
however , any private contractors in @entity11 are still paid from the public purse , and the budget for @entity56 's @entity11 is scheduled to increase from £ 105.6billion in 2013 - 14 to £ 110.4billion in 2015 - 16			2
the world - renowned @entity63 last week revealed how the @entity65 has actually been cutting health services in recent years while there have been funding increases in @entity11			2
now , a document released to the @entity14 shows how @entity12 's @entity11 chiefs discussed ' significant challenges ' and further cutbacks at a meeting on august 6			1
former prime minister @entity74 used a speech today to accuse the @entity19 of ' perpetrating a lie ' about protecting the @entity11 with independence the @entity19 are ' perpetrating a lie ' about protecting the @entity11 with independence because @entity47 already has the power to keep the health service in public hands , former prime minister @entity74 has said			1
mr @entity74 said the nationalists should make way for a @entity85 government in @entity12 if they continue to insist they are ' powerless ' to protect the @entity11 without a @entity5 vote in the independence referendum			1
the @entity19 has argued that the health service north of the border is at risk due to health policies at @entity92 , despite the area being devolved to the @entity47			1
speaking at a campaign event in @entity95 , @entity96 , mr @entity74 said : ' the @entity11 lie of the @entity19 has been exposed			1
the @entity47 can keep the @entity11 in public hands with its existing powers			0
' if the @entity19 continue to say they are powerless to protect the @entity11 in @entity12 , let them make way for a @entity85 government in @entity12 and we will protect the @entity11			1
' mr @entity74 said the @entity103 would never allow the health service to be privatised in @entity12			1
' it is the @entity19 who are perpetrating a lie about what the @entity11 can and can not do in @entity12 , ' he said			1
' over these next few hours , you must remind the people in @entity12 the @entity11 has the powers and the @entity47 has the powers to fund the health service , to protect the health service , to stop any privatisation , and to keep the health service in public hands			1
' it estimates a reduction in day - to - day spending of £ 210million in 2015 - 16 , rising to £ 224million in 2016 - 17 , warning that annual savings will need to increase from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent			0
' significant revenue pressures will be realised in 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 , primarily due to the combined effect of a reducing increase in baseline funding , the project impact of the pension revaluation [ contribution increases ] and loss of national insurance rebate and the cost of funding of the drugs budget – largely due to changes to access to rare and ultra rare drugs , availability of new treatments or extending use to new indications , ' it states			0
' the total savings required will be £ 400million - to - £ 450million in addition to savings required in 2014 - 15			0
' it adds : ' limited time is available to plan for 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 and immediate action is required to collectively assess the options that will ensure that @entity11 can operate within its overall allocation and that we can continue to provide quality , safe and effective care to our constituent populations			0
' last night , @entity85 leader @entity154 said : ' these papers show that the @entity19 have a secret agenda to cut health spending after the referendum			2
' @entity28 was elected on a manifesto to protect health spending and now he is planning cuts but has decided not to tell anyone until after thursday 's vote			2
' writing in today 's @entity14 , professor sir @entity0 argues against ' trivialising ' the challenge facing health services with ' emotional political soundbites '			1
and in a new report , @entity35 , the chief executive of @entity11 , states : ' the @entity47 has run its own @entity11 for the past 15 years , with freedom to set its own health spending			2
that will continue regardless of the result of their independence referendum			0
' however , @entity12 patients currently make use of a number of specialist health services throughout @entity11 , such as heart / lung / and other organ transplants as well as numerous specialist cancer treatments			1
@entity28 , pictured , and his ministers have claimed that voting for separation is the only way to protect @entity12 's @entity11 budget a vote for independence would create a ' @entity9 of health ' between @entity11 and @entity12 , the medical director of @entity11 warns today ' were @entity11 to decide to cede from the @entity191 , the legal status of @entity12 patients wishing to access these services south of the border would change			1
' this would require a new bilateral agreement , or if @entity12 were accepted into the @entity198 / @entity197 then @entity12 patients could in theory be treated here on the same basis as , say , a patient from @entity202 or @entity203			0
' responding to the leaked document , a @entity65 spokesman said : ' we have and will go on protecting and increasing the @entity11 budget , and our latest £ 12.1billion resource budget reflects a funding increase in real terms for both 2014 - 15 and 2015 - 16			2
' more than £ 1.5billion has been ploughed back into frontline services through efficiency savings in @entity11 over the last six years thanks to the three per cent target set by this government			0
' this paper is part of the regular discussions among @entity11 leaders to plan for @entity11 's future			0
health boards have submitted their plans for how they continue to deliver quality care and treatment within their allocated funding			0
' like all healthcare systems around the world , @entity12 's @entity11 needs to continue evolving			1
' no campaign 's fury over secret @entity11 cuts as @entity232 makes bid to be @entity235 's unlikely saviour @entity232 and @entity236 today hit out at @entity28 for suggesting that @entity12 independence could save the @entity11			1
the two @entity239 heavyweights pointed to a secret report warning that @entity12 health services face £ 400million of cuts as proof that the @entity11 is not safe in the @entity19 's hands			1
their intervention came as mr @entity232 , the former party leader , was being promoted as an unlikely last - minute saviour of the @entity235			0
the @entity239 unveiled a new campaign poster with a huge picture of mr @entity232 on the side , leading him to say ' they 're keeping the best till last '			0
@entity251 : the @entity239 today sought to put forward @entity232 as a ' big beast ' of the @entity235 campaign ; mr @entity232 is pictured alongside @entity236 , @entity255 and @entity256 mr @entity28 has repeatedly insisted that the @entity11 in @entity12 will be subjected to increasing privatisation if the @entity191 stays together			2
but at a campaign event in @entity259 today , mr @entity232 reminded voters that the @entity11 , @entity261 and pound had been created using the resources of the whole of @entity191			0
' these achievements were built without borders , and to put down artificial borders in the 21st century is absurd , ' he said			0
' the @entity19 ran up the flag of fear , saying that if you vote no you would be complicit in bringing about the break - up of the @entity11			2
' but ministers have been sitting on a report warning of a £ 400million shortfall in the @entity11 in @entity12			1
' fightback : mr @entity236 and mr @entity232 both claimed that the @entity11 would face huge cuts under the @entity19 mr @entity236 , the chief secretary to the treasury , added : ' the big news on the @entity11 is the £ 400million of cuts			2
' we know that a @entity5 vote would mean deep cuts to public services , year after year after year			0
' the use of mr @entity232 on the new poster suggests that the ex-leader , who was forced to resign in 2006 after struggling with a drinking problem , is being set up as a ' big beast ' who can tackle the charismatic @entity28 in the run - up to thursday 's vote			0
' maybe they 're keeping the best till last , you never know , ' he said today - after pointedly describing himself as a member of the ' @entity295 '			0
mr @entity236 added : ' @entity232 is one of the most respected political figures here in @entity12			0
' it 's very important that people hear from @entity232 and the @entity239			0
' junior minister @entity255 , the mp for @entity300 , said : ' @entity232 is a fantastic asset			0
he 's well - loved - he absolutely the right person to be the @entity239 representative			0

yes vote would create *barrier* between between @entity11 and @entity12
claim made by medical director of @entity11 professor sir @entity0
report shows @entity12 's struggling @entity11 faces £ 450m cutbacks under @entity19
@entity74 accuses @entity19 of ' perpetrating a lie ' about the health service
