former detective chief inspector @entity6 was convicted following a five - day trial which cost more than £ 18,300 after he replaced a wooden box - winder spiral staircase with a straight one during renovations			1
a court heard @entity11 at @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14 , was ' unfit for human habitation ' when mr @entity6 , who helped arrested @entity3 mastermind @entity16 , bought it in 1996 and spent £ 250,000 saving it from ruin			1

@entity6 and his wife @entity20 have put their house up for sale after being convicted of damaging it 17 years ago by replacing a spiral staircase the court at @entity33 heard how @entity6 had offered to replace the spiral staircase as far back as 1999 - but there was then a dispute about which way round it should turn			1
@entity6 wanted it facing to the right to prevent the steps coming up through the floor of his newly remodelled bathroom			1
but planning bosses at the @entity45 insisted on the traditional turn to the left to preserve the original lay - out of the rooms			1
the couple denied failing to comply with an enforcement notice originally served in 1998			2
but they were convicted after a five - day trail costing more than £ 18,300 at @entity54			1

district judge @entity74 called the case a ' sorry saga ' and said it would have cost the couple less money if they had carried out the work in the first place			2
mr @entity6 was a top ' thief catcher ' whose career highlights included helping @entity84 arrest @entity3 mastermind @entity16 ( pictured ) he understood how the couple must feel ' frustrated and let down ' by the rejection of a string of compromise plans by the national park			1
but the couple were guilty under planning law - which might be seen as ' strict and draconian ' but was laid down by @entity92 , he added			2
@entity93 , defending , said : ' this is not a case where someone has acquired a national treasure with almost irreplaceable visual aspect which has been vandalised			2
' they have restored a derelict property to a thing of relative beauty which is an asset to the national park			0
' after the hearing mr @entity6 branded the verdict ' outrageous ' and a ' travesty of justice '			1
mrs @entity108 , who said she expected a not guilty verdict , added : ' i ’m not shocked			0
i ’m just very angry			0
' the @entity111 has refused a @entity113 request to say how much the saga - involving three appeals , a full blown public inquiry and 16 years of legal proceedings - has cost			1
but the @entity119 claim the cost to tax payers runs into six figures			0
mr @entity6 recalled : ' the staircase fell apart when we took it out			1
it was only held together with fence stakes			0
' he dumped the wreckage in the cow shed			0
it was in half a dozen pieces by this time and ended up on a bonfire			0
@entity16 handcuffed to two policemen for a court appearance in november 1968 the country was left stunned after a train was hijacked and robbed 35 miles from its @entity140 destination in august 1963			0
a 17 - strong gang launched the raid on the overnight service from @entity144 at the @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 in the early hours of august 8 in what has been dubbed the ' crime of the century '			2
led by the charismatic @entity16 , the group of criminals pulled off the notorious heist , making off with £ 2.6million - the equivalent of £ 40million today			2
the train was stopped at a set of fixed signals which the gang had switched , leading driver @entity157 to go and investigate			0
he was knocked out by an iron bar wielded by an unknown member of the gang , forcing him to give up work , and he died seven years later			0
following an outcry over @entity164 cashing in on her husband 's crime by selling her story to the @entity168 , the @entity162 sponsored a fund to help @entity171 's family , raising more than £ 34,000 by the time of his death			2
the bulk of the huge haul has never been recovered			0
the gang shared out the proceeds at isolated @entity179 taking around £ 148,000 - but thereafter things started to go badly wrong , with nearly all the gang members being rounded up by the police			2
in fact , the @entity184 hide - out was a huge mistake on the part of the gang			0
the police were telling reporters that they were looking for an isolated farm which had just changed hands and which was 25 miles from the scene of the crime			0
@entity194 met every one of these requirements			0
when the gang became aware that the police were hot on their scent , they quit the farm hurriedly , leaving behind scores of tell - tale fingerprints			0
