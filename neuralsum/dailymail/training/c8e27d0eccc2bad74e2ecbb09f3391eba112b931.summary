@entity16 's police *introduced* the @entity13 hashtag # @entity39 where citizens can show them as a force for good , but it quickly backfired
images and stories of police brutality quickly *cropped* up with the @entity16 tag
the same is now happening on the @entity158 with @entity73 and in other cities like @entity65 and @entity70
