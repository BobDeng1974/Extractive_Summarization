ministers came under fresh criticism for their handling of the @entity3 last night after it emerged the ambulance service will be hit with £ 90 million in fines – as punishment for the chaos blighting casualty departments			1
critics said the fines will simply deprive trusts of vital funds that could help tackle the deterioration in patient services			1
a new penalty clause that was written into ambulance trust contracts from last month will levy fines of £ 200 for every patient who has to wait for longer than 30 minutes for admission to @entity20 , and £ 1,000 for each patient forced to wait more than an hour			1
closures : the devastating impact of casualties shutting across the nation delays : the ambulance service faces millions of pounds in fines if patients can not be delivered to @entity20 units but acute overcrowding in @entity20 departments has led to increasing ambulance ‘ jams ’ formed as they queue to unload , with waits of four hours recorded at some hospitals at the busiest times			1
damning new figures reveal that during the past year there were more than 265,000 occasions in @entity42 when ambulance staff took more than half an hour to deliver patients into the hands of hospital doctors			1
doctors and mps have vowed to fight ‘ disastrous ’ new plans to close two more @entity20 departments that will affect more than a million people			1
the proposals come despite growing concerns about over-burdened emergency departments across the country , with record attendance figures and soaring waiting times			1
@entity3 bosses have tabled plans to close a&es at hospitals in @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 in nearby @entity65 – even though they are highly regarded by patients			1
it means eight a&es within the @entity69 are now threatened with closure , joining a growing list nationwide			0
proposals to downgrade @entity62 and @entity73 to ‘ urgent care centres ’ were slipped out on the website of an @entity3 review panel for @entity76 called @entity77 , @entity75			0
some of these @entity79 are staffed only by nurses			0
consultant - led maternity services at @entity64 could also go			0
the review panel says that concentrating services at three hospitals in the region is necessary because the existing five are failing to meet quality standards			0
centralising will mean senior staff are available round the clock , it says			0
the plan is to beef up gp surgeries and other ‘ community services ’ to stop people going to @entity20			1
but @entity95 , @entity95 mp for @entity96 and @entity97 , said : ‘ proposing the closure of @entity20 and maternity at @entity64 without a clear idea of how the gp and community services will be improved is a recipe for disaster			1
‘ it will shunt more people into what are already busy and often overloaded @entity20 and maternity units			1
’ he is being supported by other mps , including justice secretary @entity110 , @entity111 mp for @entity62 and @entity112 , who says the plans would mean ‘ cannibalising ’ two hospitals to ‘ bolster ’ the remaining three , in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			2
in @entity42 and @entity119 , at least 14 hospitals have either closed their casualty wards or have cut their services			2
a further 14 @entity20 departments are under threat of being closed down or merged			1
by @entity124 and shockingly , more than 37,000 patients had to wait over an hour to move on to the wards			1
official guidelines say ambulances should deliver patients , clean the ambulance and be back out on the road within 15 minutes			2
a longer wait is seen as ‘ unsafe ’			0
yet the chaos in @entity20 departments is so bad that at one , the @entity136 and @entity137 , doctors were forced to put up a tent to act as a makeshift ward to treat patients alongside the ambulance queue			1
if the ‘ handover delays ’ continue at their current level then the ambulance trusts will have to find nearly £ 90 million to pay to the @entity145 over the next financial year			1
the fines were introduced after @entity3 chief executive sir @entity148 said last year that he would like to see handover delays treated as ‘ never events ’ because of their impact on patients			1
fewer than a third of trusts hit their target of achieving a 15 - minute turnaround in 95 per cent of cases			2
in @entity76 , where the situation is at its worst , the 15 - minute target is missed in nearly half of all cases			0
last night shadow health secretary @entity163 said that depriving one part of the @entity165 of money as a ‘ punishment ’ for delays beyond its control was divisive and counterproductive			1
‘ this is a clear sign of the chaos that is now engulfing the @entity3 , ’ he said			0
‘ people expect to see the @entity3 pulling together to protect patients			2
they do not expect to see one part of it fighting another			0
‘ @entity20 departments across the country are reaching crisis point			1
thousands of nursing posts have been lost , leaving hospitals understaffed			0
@entity181 has slashed council budgets to the bone , resulting in cuts to home care and support , leaving elderly patients stranded unnecessarily in hospital beds			2
‘ hospitals ca n’t move patients from @entity20 through to wards so ambulances are unable to discharge patients			1
‘ now , to top it all , hospitals are having to pay thousands of pounds in fines because of the delays			2
‘ this is no solution and it will only make matters worse			0
these are problems made in @entity202 , not in our hospitals			0
it is @entity181 ’s toxic medicine of budget cuts and top - down reorganisation that has brought the system to its knees			2
‘ he urgently needs to get a grip and sort out this crisis			0
this money should be used to put nurses in our hospitals not paid out in fines			0
’ queues : problems in @entity20 are causing some patients waiting over an hour to be moved into hospital the region with the greatest number of handover delays was @entity76 , which had 63,962 delays longer than 30 minutes			1
of these , 4,240 were over an hour			0
if that is repeated this year , the trust will have to pay more than £ 17 million in fines			2
@entity227 faces the highest fine – more than £ 20 million – if it repeats its 63,426 delays			0
its fine would be the highest because an alarming 8,010 of these were longer than an hour			0
critical : shadow health secretary @entity163 said fining ambulance services was divisive and counterproductive the best performance came from the @entity235 ( @entity236 ) , where just 10,596 delays of more than 30 minutes were recorded last year			1
even this performance would see the trust hit by a fine of £ 6.4 million			0
delays at @entity20 mean ambulance crews may be prevented from attending other emergencies , if paramedics are stuck in corridors or in their vehicles with patients waiting for a nurse or doctor to take over			1
although procedures are in place to ensure that those whose lives are in danger can be fast - tracked into hospital ahead of those not at immediate risk , critics say patient care is still seriously jeopardised			0
@entity95 health minister @entity95 , who as @entity136 mp has observed the problems of the @entity136 and @entity262 first - hand , said : ‘ the situation with ambulance handovers has been unacceptable , and can mean that they miss their response times to other incidents			2
' we have got to try to understand why the demand for @entity20 services is going up so much			2
’ last night , a spokesman for health secretary @entity272 said : ‘ we believe that everyone should be seen quickly when they arrive at hospital , even more so when they arrive in an ambulance			0
it is unacceptable for patients to be left waiting in ambulances outside hospitals			2
‘ the @entity3 needs to ensure it has proper plans in place to deal with high demand and we are doing everything we can to support the service in treating patients as swiftly as it can			0
’ tens of thousands of readers have backed @entity292 ’s campaign against @entity20 closures since it was launched last september			2
we have received a total of 32,074 protests from our readers – 17,290 coupons , 9,745 emails and 5,039 text messages			0
they are concerned that closing down their local @entity20 departments could risk lives as it will lead to longer journey times to hospital			1
in october , we delivered your response to @entity181 ’s doorstep , when our reporters handed over two bulging mailbags of your petitions to 10 @entity202			0
in the same month , a powerful lobby of 140 senior physicians , academics and surgeons signed an open letter to mr @entity181 calling for an end to the ‘ indiscriminate ’ closure of @entity20 units across the country			1
they accused health chiefs of driving through changes just to save money , rather than for valid clinical reasons			0
it is believed that more than 25 @entity20 wards out of 220 units have closed down , been downgraded or face being shut			1
such cuts are having devastating impacts on local residents			0
plea : the @entity292 has been campaigning to stop @entity20 closures fiasco : in september we revealed how longer waiting times were putting lives at risk @entity148 's story : we told how a former paramedic who died after delays getting to hospital after a heart attack secret : the @entity343 published information from a hidden @entity3 study showing @entity20 closures affect health			1

ambulance trusts fined for waiting outside overcrowded casualty units
more than 37,000 patients waited more than a hour last year
fines are counterproductive ' punishments ' , says @entity163 mp
up to 14 more @entity20 departments could close , following cuts to 14 others
