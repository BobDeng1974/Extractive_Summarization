the first @entity1 administration official to address desertion charges filed against @entity4 sgt. @entity3 said wednesday night that trading five high - value @entity6 leaders for his safe return was ' absolutely ' the right thing to do			1
' was it worth it ? absolutely , ' said @entity11 , the chief spokeswoman at the @entity12			1
' we have a commitment to our men and women serving overseas – or serving in our military – defending our national security every day , that we 're going to do everything we can to bring them home if we can , and that 's what we did in this case			0
' on thursday aboard @entity25 , @entity24 deputy press secretary @entity23 backed her up , saying that president @entity1 ' will not allow a member of the @entity29 armed forces to be left behind			1
' ' was it worth it ? absolutely , ' said @entity12 spokeswoman @entity11 of the sgt. @entity3 prisoner swap @entity3 , shown before his handover to @entity29 troops in may 2014 , was ransomed for five high - level @entity6 leaders in a @entity24 maneuver that has drawn criticism from members of @entity41 @entity11 spoke to @entity43 anchor @entity42			1
she is scheduled to take over the job of @entity24 communications director next month from @entity46 , who will transition to a role with @entity49 's presidential campaign			1
' you know , this is a commitment we 've made , we 've long made , we 've made for decades , ' said @entity11			2
bringing @entity3 home at any cost ' was an important message for this president to deliver to the @entity29 people , ' @entity53 added thursday , ' but also to people all around the world , that the @entity29 and their commander - in - chief stands squarely behind our men and women in uniform – and with the commitment we have made to not leave them behind			1
' he would n't , however , comment on the criminal charges facing @entity3			2
' there 's an ongoing military justice process that 's underway and i do n't want to say anything that might interfere with that investigation , or even leave anyone with the appearance of some sort of interference , ' @entity53 told reporters			2
' but that is a process that will run its course as it should			0
' the @entity1 administration 's ransom deal has come under new fire as @entity3 's criminal charges under the @entity84 were read yesterday at @entity85 in @entity86			1
@entity88 chairman @entity87 , a @entity90 @entity89 , said the charges of desertion and ' misbehavior before the enemy ' were ' the exclamation point on the bad deal the @entity1 administration cut to free five terrorist killers in its rush to empty the prison at @entity101			1
' ' @entity102 ' : the terror leaders traded for @entity3 were ( top , from left ) : @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 ; and ( bottom from left ) : @entity110 , mullah @entity111 @entity113 @entity112 rep. @entity112 , who chairs the @entity114 , said president @entity1 ' endangered our national security and broke the law when he chose to negotiate with terrorists and release hardened enemy combatants from @entity101 in exchange for sgt. @entity3 – who many believed at the time was a deserter			1
' and @entity126 @entity112 sen. @entity125 wrote in a scathing op - ed for @entity128 asking : ' who will be held accountable for breaking the law regarding the release of prisoners from the detention facility at @entity101 , @entity134 ? @entity3 will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the @entity84 ' desertion with @entity138 to @entity139 or @entity140 ' : @entity141 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he ' quits his unit , organization , or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service			1
' it can carry a death sentence but the military wo n't seek that option in the @entity3 case @entity156 : 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay ' @entity163 ' : article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy , throwing down his weapons , abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit , or otherwise purposely failing ' to do his utmost to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy any enemy troops , combatants , vessels , aircraft , or any other thing , which it is his duty so to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy			2
' @entity156 : life in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay ' in executing the transfer of five detainees from @entity101 in exchange for @entity3 , the president violated a law that requires him to notify @entity41 30 days before any transfer of terrorists from the detention facility , ' @entity125 wrote , ' and to explain how the threat posed by the terrorists has been substantially mitigated			2
' ' his failure to adhere to a law he signed places our nation ’s security at great risk for the foreseeable future			0
' @entity1 himself has not addressed the @entity3 issue since his charges were read on wednesday			1
but he insisted in a june 2014 press conference that he had made the right decision			0
' i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents , ' the president said then , ' and that the @entity29 people understand that this is somebody 's child and that we do n't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back			1
' @entity3 was captured by the @entity6 after leaving his post in june 2009 and held by members of the @entity222 , an insurgent group tied to the @entity6 that operates both in @entity224 and @entity225			1
before disappearing , @entity3 had expressed misgivings about the @entity29 role in the war – as well as his own			1
last may 31 , @entity3 was handed over to @entity29 special forces in @entity225 as part of an exchange for five @entity6 commanders who were imprisoned at @entity101 , @entity134			1
the exchange set off a debate over whether the @entity29 should have released the five @entity6 members			1
@entity237 is known about what the five have been doing in @entity240 , where they are being monitored by the government			0
some lawmakers have predicted that the five would return to the battlefield , and at least two have said they intend to			0
@entity3 was charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy ; the first carries up to five years in prison , the latter up to life			1
a conviction on either could strip him of his rank and all pay and earn him a dishonorable discharge			0
the ' misbehavior ' charge is rare and typically reserved for shameful or cowardly conduct , said @entity257 , a military defense lawyer and the author of a forthcoming book on military crimes			0
@entity3 , 28 , wo n't face a death sentence , although the punishment is an option for prosecutors to pursue against deserters in wartime			0
but his case does raise the question of whether military prosecutors will lock away for life a man the @entity29 gave up five imprisoned @entity6 commanders to bring home			1
@entity4 col. @entity273 addressed the news media about charges against @entity4 sgt. @entity3 at @entity85 , @entity86 on wednesday , march 25 , 2015 , reading a one - page statement but not taking any questions a death penalty case was likely a non-starter after all that had to be sacrificed to bring him home , @entity283 , a @entity284 law professor , retired @entity25 officer and former military lawyer told the @entity287			2
president @entity1 said less than a week after he traded @entity290 fighters for @entity3 that he would make ' no apologies ' for the decision in fact , his defense attorney might successfully argue he deserves leniency after years as a prisoner			1
' that 's pretty good mitigation evidence , ' @entity283 said			0
' it would n't surprise me at all if what he ended up with was a dishonorable discharge and no jail time			0
' @entity3 's ' reintegration ' when he returned to @entity305 in @entity113 suggests how difficult his life was in captivity			2
he was on a bland diet at first and did not initially have access to a television			0
he was gradually allowed to venture off the base to go to grocery stores , restaurants and shopping centers			0
he even had to readjust to the idea that he could control aspects of his life as simple as choosing when to eat , and what			0
however , the charges underscore the military 's position that the hardship of his captivity does n't outweigh the ramifications of leaving his post			0
some members of his former unit have called for serious punishment , saying others risked their lives searching for him			0
' the military 's obviously a very rough job			0
... but everybody else stayed with the oath and did what they signed up to do			0
and as a result of that , some did n't get to come home , ' said @entity340 , 26 , who served in @entity3 's platoon			2
he said @entity3 should be stripped of his pay and benefits and be dishonorably discharged @entity344 , a military defense lawyer not involved with @entity3 's case , said he expected a long prison sentence and wondered why the @entity29 bothered to bring him back			1
' the administration traded a known @entity6 for this guy only to bring him back and put him in jail , ' @entity344 said			1
' that seems to me like a waste of resources			0
' in an interview wednesday with @entity355 , @entity3 's attorney , @entity356 , claimed the major general who conducted an investigation of the case before the charges were brought ' never mentioned ' the misbehavior charge ' and i do n't think he had it in mind , and i do n't frankly know how it got on the charge sheet			2
' ' this is a matter that i anticipate we 'll contest , ' he said			0
@entity356 said the desertion charge and the misbehavior charge ' are simply two ways of describing the same conduct , and i think it 's unfortunate that someone got creative in drafting the charge sheet and figured out two ways to charge the same thing			2
' @entity257 said he would n't expect the @entity4 to seek much prison time for @entity3 because of his time as a @entity6 captive , but officials needed to prosecute the case because a conviction means @entity3 can not collect special compensation as a prisoner of war			2
' he did spend x number of years as a prisoner of the @entity6 — that certainly mitigates the need for him to be locked up , ' @entity257 said			0
' but as a political matter , i do n't think we can stomach the possibility that he deserted his post and could receive $ 300,000 in back pay for it			0

' was it worth it ? absolutely , ' said @entity11 , the chief spokeswoman at the @entity12
@entity11 will become the @entity24 's communications director next month when the *incumbent* flack joins @entity49 's presidential campaign
' the commander in chief will not allow a member of the @entity29 armed forces to be left behind , ' a @entity24 spokesman added
*republicans* hurled we - told - you - sos at the @entity24 after @entity3 was charged with desertion and ' misbehavior before the enemy '
the @entity1 administration traded five high - value @entity6 fighters for his safe return last year
