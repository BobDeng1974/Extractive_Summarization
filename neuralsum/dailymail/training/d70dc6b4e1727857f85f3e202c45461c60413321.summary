a crumbling city flattened by an earthquake filled with families still struggling to rebuild their lives needed nothing short of a superhero , and lucky for a @entity7 city that 's exactly what they got			1
@entity10 emerged from the rubble following one of the most devastating natural disasters @entity14 had ever seen , anonymously delivering supplies to those who needed it most			1
now , nearly three years into his mission the secretive superhero is going from strength to strength armed with his simple message ' be a bruv ... share the luv ' , and a whole lot of kindness			1
' people had this real negative vibe around @entity14 and i wanted to change that			0
a lot of my friends were leaving the city and more people followed , ' @entity10 told the @entity46			2
' i love @entity14 and have always lived here so i wanted to bring back some joy and happiness to the city in a quirky fun way			2
initially i thought to just help my friends with some food package deliveries but then changed it to strangers , and within one day i had made a @entity55 page , ordered a costume and delivered my first two food packages to people			1
' a new short documentary in sync with the superhero 's strong social media presence gives an insight into the life of @entity10 and brings to light the good deeds he does for those in need			2
originally @entity10 's aim was to help struggling students , knowing all too well the toils of studying while trying to support yourself , made all the more difficult by the earthquake			1
' the first people i was delivering to were all students ... seeing as a lot were leaving @entity14 for @entity76 or further afield it seemed like a way i could help			1
' so that 's why the name ' @entity10 ' came about as students pretty much all live in flats together			2
it was n't until it started getting in the local papers that the focus changed from students to families and children , and pretty much anyone that could do with some cheering up , ' he said			0
the caped crusader travels to school around the city teaching kids the power of kindness @entity10 is recognised in his home town by his distinct lycra costume , as he delivers packages to those in need the superhero gets around in his flat mobile , spreading generosity wherever he goes the @entity14 earthquake in february 2011 flattened the city on @entity7 's south island , killing 185 and devastating many more who escaped with their lives but barely anything else			1
since the devastating natural disaster , @entity10 's focus has now changed , and he is now quite literally the city 's hero , travelling far and wide to work with school kids , inspiring them to be their very own superheroes by ' being kind , generous , and looking out for each other			1
' in his red and black lycra costume complete with a mask and gloves , @entity10 spreads hope with random acts of kindness , including what he calls ' @entity10 vs traffic jam packs ' , small gifts given to drivers stuck in traffic to brighten their days			2
but his trademark power is the secret delivery of food packs , which he drops on people 's doorsteps when they least expect it , often when they have n't even asked for help			0
these packs generally include some basic food items plus some other goodies , and always have toilet paper in them			0
' the food packages are a mixture of essentials like toilet paper , tomato sauce , rice and pasta to more of the treat items like @entity146 , @entity147 , lollies and chips			1
most food packages are around the $ 30 mark , ' @entity10 said			1
originally @entity10 paid for these all out of his own pocket , and admitted he could spend up to $ 600 per month putting together the parcels			0
@entity10 visits kids across the city spreading his message and teaching kids to look out for each other community engagement is just part of @entity10 's duties as the @entity14 superhero he also attends charity events , but is never without his mask and cape @entity10 started his self - driven mission following the devastation of the @entity14 earthquake in 2011 , which destroyed the city and left thousands without their homes now thanks to sponsorship and community donations , the caped crusader has a little more help providing to those in need , and can assist with more specific requests			1
' i started off paying for the groceries myself which some months would get super expensive but it never worried me as my main focus was helping others , ' @entity10 revealed			0
' i now have sponsors like @entity185 who gave me the flat mobile to make my deliveries in , and also countdown ( supermarket ) and @entity191 cereal who provide me with vouchers and food to distribute to deserving people			0
' as well as inspiring school kids all around the city , @entity10 visits children 's hospitals - often calling in the help of his super friends to brighten up the lives of sick kids			1
earlier this month he staged a ' @entity204 ' , a visit to the @entity205 at @entity206 to spread to the ' luv ' to young ones and their families struggling with illness			2
with a crew bragging @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 and more in tow , the band of merry men and women took over the ward in true superhero style scaling buildings , surprising children and spreading love			0
with his horizons ever expanding , @entity10 revealed he responds to all sorts of requests that come to him from the local community			0
since humble beginnings in 2011 @entity10 has the support of his community behind him inspiring kids to be their own superhero is just part of what @entity10 does , all while donning a spectacular red and black lycra costume another of the hero 's trademarks is ' @entity10 vs traffic packs ' which can include stress balls or lollies for drivers stuck in their cars ' i get a mixture of requests and nominations through my @entity55 page and email			1
i never judge anyone that writes in as anybody is deserving of an act of random kindness			0
and that 's what it is , ' he said			0
' i know that one food package is n't going to change the world but it might just make their day , week or month that little bit easier knowing someone has taken a moment of their day to care about them			0
' @entity10 originally had a side - kick , @entity268 , but is now on the hunt for a new friend to join him , and duties would include ' delivering of food packages , spreading joy and teaching children the powers of kindness '			1
the prospective assistant must also be able to drive the flat mobile , a bright red decorated car splashed with @entity10 's name , and will also need to don their very own lycra costume			0
when asked what was next on the agenda , the secret superhero said he would love to be @entity10 full - time but it 's too difficult to juggle around work			2
this however , is not a deterrent and he is committed to continuing his incredible work			0
' @entity292 always got plans for the future			0
being a superhero you never stop thinking up ways of trying to help others , ' @entity10 said			2
' some of my more ambitious ideas are to create a @entity301 right here in @entity14 that i can not only work from but kids can come and visit , interact with and leave with the message that anyone can be a superhero if they 're kind , generous and show compassion to others			1
@entity10 is now on the look out for a side - kick , someone who can help spread the message of kindness to kids all while wearing lycra the superhero wants to travel to other parts of the world and assist in areas that suffered similar devastation to his hometown @entity14 ' i 'd also love to take the message to other countries who perhaps have gone through equally tough natural disasters like @entity14 and visit kids and families to help lighten the situation using kindness and fun as the main drives			1
' i need to be flatman full - time with the all the school requests , charity and events requests and food deliveries			0
maybe one day the right company or person will step up to make this childhood dream come true			0
' if you 'd like to help @entity10 's cause , you can donate here , or keep up with the superhero 's adventures here .			2
