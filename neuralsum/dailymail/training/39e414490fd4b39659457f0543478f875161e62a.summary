@entity0 took a big step towards accepting his days as a test cricketer are over by paving the way for his return to the @entity5			1
the @entity8 one - day captain ’s decision to put his name forward for the @entity5 auction on february 17 in @entity11 is a realisation that he remains further away than ever from adding to his 16 test appearances			1
this time last year @entity16 , then the new managing director , persuaded @entity0 to miss out on the @entity18 riches in a clear indication that @entity8 wanted to give him another chance to prove he can thrive in the ultimate game			0
@entity8 captain @entity0 has put his name forward for the @entity5 auction in february yet he failed to score enough first - class runs with @entity24 to stake a claim to face @entity26 and @entity27 last summer and seemingly realises that he is better off concentrating on the limited - overs formats that made his name			1
‘ my ambition is still to play @entity32 , absolutely , but given where i ’m at at the moment i think the @entity5 is the best thing for me , ’ said @entity0 ahead of friday ’s winner takes all tri-series match against @entity27			1
@entity0 , who will not miss any @entity8 one - day cricket while he is in @entity27 , has always said that he wants to revive a @entity32 career that was derailed against @entity37 three years ago but has now had to scale down his ambitions			1
@entity0 is @entity8 's @entity40 captain and says he still wants to play test cricket but his chances have been ' scaled down ' after not making the team in the summer ‘ the opportunity i gave myself in missing the @entity5 was the potential carrot at the end of the road , ’ said the former @entity11 and @entity45 player			1
‘ i think there were three positions available in the test team at the start of last summer but i did n’t manage to get any of them			0
so since then it ’s been scaled down a bit			0
’ the immediate conclusion is that @entity0 and @entity58 , who will also join the auction , believe they have no chance of being picked for the three - @entity32 tour of @entity63 that follows swiftly on from the @entity64			0
that tour clashes with the @entity5 in its entirety meaning that no test players will be able to even have a short stay in @entity27 , as has been possible previously			2
@entity0 is preparing to lead @entity8 in their latest @entity70 game with @entity27 on friday it also raises major questions over the strength of the @entity63 side that @entity8 will face in april as many of the @entity77 ’s best players , at loggerheads with their own board , may decide to put @entity18 money ahead of test cricket			1
the @entity82 will have no qualms about @entity0 throwing in his lot with the @entity5 this time because there is a growing acceptance that it is in @entity8 ’s best interests for as many of their players as possible to experience the @entity5 and the @entity89 , which has been incredibly successful here this year			1
there is also so much cricket now , particularly this year , that the @entity82 realise it will become harder for players to feature in all formats and accept @entity8 will increasingly move towards different teams for different cricket			0
@entity96 and @entity97 were in the nets at the @entity99 ahead of the match with @entity27 @entity0 , as a new international captain , believes he will benefit from returning to a competition that includes many of the world ’s best players but few from @entity8 because of fixture clashes and workloads			1
‘ it ’s nice to have one ear to the ground both by playing in the @entity89 and potentially the @entity5 again , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s very useful because cricket is changing so much that it ’s good to have new , fresh ideas			0
‘ i think any @entity8 player who has the chance to play in these competitions should grab it with both hands			0
it ’s a great experience and a huge opportunity to put yourself under pressure and bridge that gap between our domestic game at home and the international game			0
’ @entity8 bowler @entity127 gets past @entity128 during a game of touch rugby during training @entity132 beats @entity127 during a game of touch rugby at the @entity99 @entity135 , who hit 264 on his own for @entity27 in a one - day game last year against @entity26 , had a fitness test at the @entity99 today on the hamstring injury that has kept him out of the tri-series so far			2
and if he comes through it and plays in friday ’s game it will be a major boost to an @entity27 side who have looked weary and , frankly , uninterested in this tournament so far having already been in @entity146 for nearly four months			2
but @entity8 remain strong favourites to repeat their comprehensive defeat of @entity27 at the @entity149 , particularly with the @entity99 pitch expected to provide its usual bounce			0
the winners play @entity146 in sunday ’s final .			2
