a 24 - year - old male supermarket worker is preparing for a legal battle to become @entity3 's first single surrogate parent			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , who is gay , says he has been thinking about having a child for a few years , but only now does he feel ' mature and financially stable enough ' to do so			1
he wants to do it in his twenties , rather than wait for a partner , who may not come along			2
and , determined to achieve his ambition , he is going to take on the legal system and fight to legally adopt his own baby			2
the eggs and sperm of the intended parents can be used or they can be donor eggs and / or donor sperm			0
while it is not illegal for single parents to enter into a surrogacy arrangement , the law currently prevents them applying for a parental order that they need to be able to raise their child in the @entity3			1
@entity42 , from @entity43 , @entity3 's leading experts in @entity3 and international surrogacy law , told @entity44 that it was more difficult for a single woman to become a parent through surrogacy in the @entity3			2
here she explains the law : ' it is more difficult for a single women because they wo n't have the same connection with the baby , whereas the man would be the biological father			2
' there is nothing in the law in the @entity3 that makes it illegal to enter into a surrogacy arrangement as a single parent			2
' but it does n’t make it easy either			0
most parents through surrogacy ( including gay dads and unmarried couples ) can apply for a ‘ parental order ’ after their child is born			1
' this is an order made by the family court which gives the intended parents a new birth certificate and extinguishes the responsibilities of the surrogate mother			2
' single parents are not , however , eligible to apply			1
' this means it is perfectly legal for a man like @entity4 to have a child through surrogacy in the @entity3 , but the normal solution for families created through surrogacy ( designed to give lifelong security and certainty for the child ) is not available			1
' he will have to get creative with using law designed for other purposes to secure his family and resolve the position of his surrogate – adoption being the best alternative to a parental order if the family court will agree to help			1
' the law was extended , in 2008 , to allow gay fathers and unmarried couples to apply for surrogacy			0
currently no single man or woman in @entity3 has been able to become a parent with the help of a donor egg and a @entity3 surrogate			0
some single men are believed to have travelled abroad to @entity102 or @entity103 where they have been able to father a child through surrogacy			2
but in @entity3 the law only allows two parents to apply for a parental order for any surrogate child born this way			1
the law does n’t allow a single parent to do the same thing			0
even though @entity4 ’s sperm will be used to fertilise the donor egg and a surrogate mother will carry the child to full - term , legally , he will still have no rights over the child even when it ’s born			1
instead he ’ll have to try and adopt his own baby to get full custody - something else which has never been done before			1
@entity4 has already found a @entity3 surrogate willing to carry the baby and a fertility clinic willing to help him with an egg donor but who will remain anonymous			2
his legal case can not begin until the child is born			0
@entity4 , a supermarket worker from @entity129 , @entity5 said : ' the only thing i ’ll be told about her is her physical features such as height , hair and eye colour but i plan to choose someone with features as close to mine as i can get			1
' i ’ve been thinking about it for a few years but it ’s only recently that i feel i ’m mature and financially stable enough to have a child			1
' i own my own house , i ’ve got a good job and a great family and friends supporting me			0
' @entity4 admits that his plan is a big gamble with no guarantee that he ’d be allowed to legally adopt his own baby			1
he said : ' i 'm openly gay but i 'm not in a relationship and i do n't want to wait until i 'm in a serious relationship to have a baby			0
' everything is in place to go ahead			0
i have a close member of the family who will act as the surrogate mother i just have to find an egg donor			0
' after that i can legally take custody when the child is born but then i want to legally adopt the baby			1
i know it cost me thousands in legal fees but i have the money to finance it and i 'm determined to go through with this			0
' it ’s never been done before			0
my lawyer could n’t tell me and still ca n’t say what will or might happen because this has never been tried before			0
but to me it ’s worth the risk			0
' my lawyer says the case would initially be heard in @entity5 but if i was n’t allowed to adopt the case could end up in the @entity173 but i ’m willing to fight this all the way			2
' i just hope that by doing this that i ’ll be able to help other single people wanting to become a parent using a @entity3 surrogate			0
' @entity4 says as the law stands would - be single parents are routinely discriminated against when it comes to using a @entity3 surrogate mother			1
@entity4 could take his case as far as the @entity173 in a landmark legal battle to gain full rights of a child born through surrogacy @entity4 admits that his plan is a big gamble with no guarantee that he 'd be allowed to legally adopt his own baby pregnancy : surrogacy is when a woman gives birth to a baby for - usually - a couple , who want to have a child ( file photo ) @entity4 was just four years old when his own mother @entity201 , separated from his biological father			1
he said : ' my twin brothers were only nine - months - old so mum was single parent to three children all under the age of five			0
' @entity201 later went on to marry @entity4 ’s dad @entity207 , 43 , who adopted all three boys and raised them as his own			0
' my mum was a single parent before she met my dad so who ’s to say i wo n't meet someone in the future , ' he added			0
@entity4 has discussed the plan with his family and added : ' i ’ve got an amazing family - everyone ’s behind me			2
' no one has said a negative word about it because they know how much i want this			0
i ’ve really thought about it for such a long time			0
' i ’ve gone over every last detail time and time again - i ’ve not taken this decision lightly			0
' @entity42 , @entity4 's solicitor and an expert in surrogacy law , said @entity4 's legal case can not being until a surrogate child has been born			1
she said : ' it is only then that the legal process can begin to challenge the provisions of a parental order			1
it is not illegal but the fact that there is no provision in the law for a single person to apply for a parental order			1
' it is difficult to assess what a legal challenge would cost but there is no provision for legal aid in this sort of case			0
' we frequently see heartbreaking cases caused by the denial of surrogacy to single parents			1
' a change to the law would benefit not only prospective solo dads like @entity4 , but also single women who have survived cancer and need the help of a surrogate to carry their child , and widowed fathers who want to use embryos in storage , just as widowed mothers are able to do			1

@entity4 says he feels ' mature and financially stable enough ' to raise a child and does not want to wait for partner who may not come along
law prevents single parents applying for parental order to raise child
this means currently @entity4 would have no rights over child when born
24 - year - old from @entity5 will try to adopt baby to get full custody
