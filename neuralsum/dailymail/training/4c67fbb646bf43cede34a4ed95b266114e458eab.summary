no longer number one : @entity1 now has the second largest economy in the world @entity4 has toppled @entity5 to become the biggest economy in the world , according to figures from the @entity9			1
the @entity5 has been the global leader since it overtook @entity11 in 1872 , but has now lost its status as top dog			1
the latest @entity9 figures show the @entity4 economy is worth £ 11trillion compared with £ 10.8trillion for the @entity5			1
@entity4 – whose wealth has accelerated in recent decades amid rapid industrialisation – is expected to extend its lead , with the @entity9 estimating its economy will be worth £ 16.7trillion in 2019			1
that would be 20 per cent bigger than the @entity5 economy , which is forecast to be worth £ 13.8trillion by then			1
the numbers are based on ‘ purchasing power parity ’ ( @entity26 ) which makes adjustments for the fact that goods are cheaper in countries such as @entity4 relative to the @entity5			2
without these adjustments for living costs , the @entity4 economy is still smaller than that of the @entity5 , at £ 6.4trillion			1
but experts have described the toppling of @entity5 after nearly 150 years by @entity4 – even on the @entity26 measure – as a ‘ symbolic ’ moment for the global economy			1
@entity4 enjoyed three decades of double - digit growth before the global downturn , as industrialisation and sweeping economic reforms created a new powerhouse in the @entity44			0
growth has slowed in recent years but remains strong by @entity47 standards with the @entity9 forecasting expansion of 7.4 per cent this year and 7.1 per cent in 2015			0
by contrast , the @entity9 is predicting growth of just 2.2 per cent in the @entity5 this year and 3.1 per cent next year , while the @entity11 is set for expansion of 3.2 per cent and 2.7 per cent			1
the @entity9 yesterday said the @entity5 and the @entity11 ‘ are approaching economic lift - off ’ as they bounce back from the recession			1
but @entity55 , chief economist at the @entity9 , warned that ‘ potential growth is lower than it was in the early 2000s ’ for much of the @entity58 , including the @entity5 and @entity11			1
financial powerhouse : in the last decade alone , the skyline of major cities in @entity4 , such as @entity62 ( pictured ) , have been completely transformed as the economy grew in leaps and bounds @entity11 led the world in the industrial revolution of the mid- 18th century , but @entity5 was hot on its heels			1
the @entity5 underwent huge industrial expansion after its civil war ended in 1865 , fuelled by rapid urbanisation and huge population growth – including the immigration of nearly 30million @entity74			0
in 1872 , its economy overtook @entity11 to become the world ’s largest , a position it held for the next 142 years			1
productivity , leading brands and innovation , coupled with the success of the @entity5 dollar and the fact that 62 per cent of the world ’s financial reserves are held in the currency , kept @entity5 on top			0
meanwhile , the economies of @entity11 and other @entity74 powers were ravaged by two world wars			0
@entity11 borrowed heavily from @entity5 during the @entity91 and received a further $ 4.3billion in 1945			2
@entity4 was the world ’s leading trading nation up to the 18th century , until control of its ports and trade were taken over by imperial nations in @entity74			0
under @entity97 it remained inward - looking , until 1980 when the government started to allow foreign investment			0
he added that @entity4 is ‘ maintaining high growth ’ which will slow in the coming years to a more ‘ healthy ’ level between 6 per cent and 7 per cent			0
@entity103 , senior fellow at the @entity105 - based @entity104 and an expert on @entity4 , recently highlighted the ‘ symbolic ’ importance of @entity4 overtaking the @entity5			2
‘ @entity4 is very big and getting bigger , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s not to be underestimated			0
’ the news that @entity4 is now the largest economy in the world is an embarrassment for @entity113 and ends @entity5 ’s 142 years at the top			1
@entity11 had out - produced the @entity5 and its @entity74 rivals for much of the 19th century , at the height of the industrial revolution and with trade links across the @entity119			2
but the @entity5 caught up as a growing population , the expansion of the railways and a focus on industry as well as agriculture boosted its economy			0
@entity4 's wealth has accelerated in recent decades amid rapid industrialisation			1
@entity129 , a car factory in @entity131 @entity4 has a population of around 1.3billion – four times that of the @entity5 – but its economy has only just become the biggest the @entity26 measure of output makes @entity137 the third largest economy , followed by @entity138 in fourth and @entity139 in fifth			2
@entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and the @entity11 make up the rest of the top 10 in that order			0
many economists believe the @entity26 measure of an economy is the fairest measure because it takes into account the cost of living in different countries			0
for example , although wages are typically far lower in less developed countries than in mature economies , goods and services are often also cheaper , which affects the comparative spending power of individuals			0
but critics argue it does not take into account how well off people actually are			0
@entity4 has a population of around 1.3billion – four times that of the @entity5 – but its economy has only just become the biggest			2
it means that individuals in @entity5 are typically far wealthier than they are in @entity4 and other emerging markets benefiting from a huge workforce and rapid growth .			2

figures show the @entity4 economy is worth £ 11trillion , the @entity5 £ 10.8trillion
the @entity9 estimates @entity4 's economy will be worth £ 16.7trillion in 2019
the @entity5 has been the global leader since it overtook @entity11 in 1872
