@entity0 has given a ' final offer ' over the proposed election tv debates , involving seven party leaders , including @entity4 a ‘ final offer ’ has been given to broadcasters for @entity4 to take part in one , seven - way tv election debate			1
@entity0 has accused the @entity9 and other networks of causing ‘ chaos ’ by attempting to dictate the terms of debates and repeatedly altering their proposals			1
it said broadcasters had ignored mr @entity4 ’s long - held position that televised clashes between leaders were over-dominant in the 2010 election campaign and should start earlier			2
number ten is proposing a debate involving mr @entity4 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity28 leader @entity27 , @entity30 leader @entity29 and @entity32 ’s @entity31 at the end of this month			1
‘ this is our final offer , and to be clear , given the fact this has been a deeply unsatisfactory process and we are within a month of the short campaign , the prime minister will not be participating in more than one debate , ’ the prime minister ’s director of communications @entity35 wrote to the @entity9			1
the @entity44 ’ ultimatum is unlikely to be agreed by other parties , or broadcasters who each want to hold one debate , prompting doubts about whether any will now take place			1
mr @entity24 has accused mr @entity4 of deliberately sabotaging negotiations over the debates and ‘ running scared ’			1
he said last night he would ‘ do it anytime , any place , anywhere ’ , adding : ‘ @entity4 must now name the day			0
’ @entity54 is suggesting a proposed head - to - head clash between mr @entity24 and the prime minister also goes ahead featuring just the @entity54 leader , leaving him debating a studio audience			2
however , sources at the main broadcasters concede it would be difficult to proceed if mr @entity4 does not agree to participate			2
in that campaign , there were three debates between the three main party leaders over three weeks			0
x factor - style push - button polling of viewers was used to declare a ‘ winner ’ in each case , with mr @entity25 ’s initial success prompting so - called ‘ @entity25 ’			2
@entity78 strategists believe that if the debates had not taken place , the @entity79 would have fared worse and mr @entity4 would have won a majority			0
@entity30 leader @entity29 ( left ) and @entity32 ’s @entity31 ( right ) would be two of the seven candidates in the televised debate , if broadcasters agree with @entity87 's suggestion they would be joined by the @entity89 's @entity27 , who the @entity44 always argued should be included under plans unveiled by the @entity9 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 last year , for this election , @entity90 ’s mr @entity26 would have been invited to take part in one debate also featuring mr @entity4 , mr @entity24 and mr @entity25			1
the @entity78 , @entity54 and @entity79 leaders were then to take part in a three - way discussion , before mr @entity4 and mr @entity24 went head - to - head in a final televised clash			0
the @entity44 complained that the @entity89 , which has been ahead of the @entity79 in several polls , should be included			0
earlier this year , the broadcasters suggested an alternative format , which would have seen two clashes involving seven parties , including the @entity108 , @entity32 and the @entity109 but excluding the @entity110 , followed by one head - to - head between mr @entity4 and mr @entity24 on april 30			1
the latest proposals have angered senior @entity79 , who complained that as a party of government they should not be reduced to minority party status			0
the 2010 election was the first to feature the debates , leading to so - called ' @entity25 ' following the success of the @entity79 leader ( right )			1
if they are to go ahead , it will be the first televised debate for @entity24 ( left ) under plans unveiled by the @entity9 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 last year , @entity90 ’s @entity26 ( pictured ) would have been invited to take part in one debate alongside @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity4 @entity90 , meanwhile , was angry that its position was diluted , while some @entity54 figures doubted the wisdom of taking part in two debates with the @entity108 and the @entity30 , both eating into their party ’s vote			1
in a letter to the @entity9 ’s @entity137 , chair of the broadcasters ’ leaders ’ debates committee , mr @entity35 said he had ‘ serious concerns about the way in which this has been handled from the start ’			0
‘ despite the prime minister having been clear about his concern around holding debates in the short campaign , you did not consult us before issuing a press release last october outlining your plans for three debates during that period , ’ he said			0
‘ had you consulted us , we could have also told you that we also did not think it was appropriate to exclude the @entity89 from the process			0
@entity78 strategists believe that if the debates had not taken place in 2010 , the @entity79 would have fared worse and mr @entity4 would have won a majority ‘ despite all of this , we then entered into negotiations in good faith , during which i made the case for a more representative debates structure , including the @entity108			2
it is fair to say that the desire to exclude the @entity108 was clear from all other parties present			2
‘ three months later – and again without consultation – you surprised us again by proposing a new seven - party structure , this time not only inviting the @entity108 , but @entity32 and the @entity30 as well			1
again , this was a flawed proposal that has resulted in the @entity110 initiating what appears to be legitimate legal action			0
‘ since this proposal has been suggested , there has been chaos			0
in recent weeks , you have avoided letting the parties sit in a room to hammer out proposals , making progress impossible			0
’ to ‘ cut through this chaotic situation ’ , he said the prime minister would take part in one , 90 - minute debate with the leaders of the @entity89 , @entity54 , @entity79 , @entity32 , @entity30 and @entity90 , to take place in the week of march 23			1
a @entity54 source said : ‘ behind the scenes , @entity4 ’s team are doing everything they can to scupper the negotiations and sink the debates			0

*branded* it ' deeply unsatisfactory ' and said they should have started earlier
ultimatum said single debate must feature @entity108 , @entity30 and @entity32
they would debate alongside @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26
other parties unlikely to agree , *raising* doubts over whether debates will *happen*
