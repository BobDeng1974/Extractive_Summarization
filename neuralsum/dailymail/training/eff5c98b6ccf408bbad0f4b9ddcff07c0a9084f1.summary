by @entity1 reporter published : 15:57 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 16:32 est , 30 january 2014 a skydiver has spoken of the terrifying moment he was knocked unconscious seconds after jumping out of a plane at 12,500ft			1
experienced skydiver @entity6 , 25 , was hit from behind by another skydiver and knocked out			1
he was left hurtling towards @entity9 countryside just after jumping out of the plane at the @entity12 ground in @entity13 , @entity14			1
speaking on @entity15 he told how he was saved from certain death by two other skydivers who , having seen what had happened , managed to grab hold of him and deploy his own parachute pictures taken on mr @entity6 's head - camera also show the other skydivers made signs to check he was okay before realizing that something had gone terribly wrong , and taking action that ultimately saved his life			1
he was knocked unconscious by another skydiver ' i 've been skydiving for five years and this was my 1,050th jump			1
there were 12 people in this skydive , with others leaving the plane just after we jump off , ' he said			2
' one of the skydivers who left the plane through the door came out unstable and went into a spin			2
' they were falling faster than i was and their shin impacted the back of my helmet with a lot of force , knocking me out and leaving me unconscious			2
from then , i 've no real recollection of what happened , ' mr @entity6 said			1
it 's hard to imagine a more heart stopping moment having jumped more than 1,000 times , he was left helpless after he blacked out , plummeting towards the earth at 120 mph			2
he went on : ' i am now tumbling through the air uncontrollably and two other skydivers realized something was wrong			2
' what happened next was incredible			0
after he is knocked unconscious , @entity6 's head camera captures how he spun round and round , hand flying in front of his face , while the plane is just a speck ( top left ) out of control : thousands of feet above the ground , mr @entity6 's arms flail around as he plummets down you ok ? this picture , taken on mr @entity6 's head - camera , shows another skydiver asking the unconscious man if he is alright			1
moment of realisation : this picture , also from mr @entity6 's head - cam , shows his colleagues realising he is not ok with the unconscious mr @entity6 's blue gloved - hand in the foreground , this picture shows the others ' concern mr @entity6 regained consciousness as he floated down , with no memory of the accident ' two of my friends came down to see if i was responding			1
' mr @entity6 was out cold and his hands were limp			1
his friends stabilized him and opened his parachute			0
' they chased after me and fortunately i roll into a more stable position - still quickly drifting in the sky			0
' at first the other skydivers give basic hand signals that we teach our students to correct their body position and find i am still not responding			0
' they manage to get hold of me to try and stop my body tumbling again as we get closer to the altitude where , as a group we separate to deploy our parachutes			0
' they signal to the other jumpers to get away as they were unaware of what was happening			0
they then deploy my main parachute			0
once i was clear they deployed their own			0
' mr @entity6 only regained consciousness as he drifted safely down to the ground , where he landed safely and with no memory at all of what had just happened			1
when he finally reached the ground , the relief he felt is clear for all to hear as he let out an enormous sigh			0
' i was just happy to be on the ground because everything moves a bit slower then			0
' he was taken to hospital where he was treated for an injury to his head , and then given the all - clear and discharged			2
' this is not something you are taught to do or practice for as it is very uncommon			0
i think my mum and girlfriend are more relieved than i am			0
' mr @entity6 added : ' i am very glad that everything unfolded how it did			1
he says that the accident has not deterred him one bit from skydiving because he loves the sport so much			0
help arrives : this head - cam shot shows one of mr @entity6 's friends grab his arm to steady him before pulling the cord with his body now stabilised in the air , another skydiver on mr @entity6 's right goes to pull the parachute cord coming in to land : the head - cam shows @entity156 and the landing zone as mr @entity6 drifts down safely down : this picture shows the grass where mr @entity6 landed , without any idea of what had just happened mr @entity6 , shown here on another jump , is an experienced skydiver who has completed more than 1,000 jumps			1
