by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:35 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 21:00 est , 20 february 2013 @entity2 suffered an embarrassing setback yesterday after the sale of the @entity6 mobile phone network delivered £ 1.2 billion less than he predicted just two months ago			1
in a highly controversial move in december the chancellor plugged a black hole in the public finances by confidently pencilling in a £ 3.5 billion profit from the sale of the 4g network , which will bring faster mobile broadband services to @entity15			2
the move helped ensure that mr @entity2 narrowly met his self - imposed rules on public borrowing when he delivered his autumn statement on the economy in december			2
@entity6 licences awarded : all the major mobile phone companies - @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity26 parent @entity24 and @entity27 - sucessfully bid for a slice of the spectrum , with @entity27 picking up the biggest piece of the pie but the telecoms watchdog @entity32 announced yesterday that the sale had raised just £ 2.3 billion - just two - thirds of the amount predicted by mr @entity2 , and barely a tenth of the £ 22.5 billion raised by the auction of the 3g network in the year 2000			1
the @entity38 last night insisted it was content with the sale , pointing out that the £ 1.2 billion shortfall was only a tiny fraction of total tax receipts			1
sources said mr @entity2 will announce in next month ’s budget how the hole in the public finances will be filled			2
but @entity47 seized on the development as another blow for mr @entity2 ’s economic strategy			0
already on the market : @entity21 was the second highest bidder paying £ 588.9million for its slice of the airwaves			1
the network already has access to @entity6 and was the first to it to @entity15 mobile users last year shadow treasury chief secretary @entity60 said : ‘ it shows how foolish and short - termist the chancellor was to bank this cash in the autumn statement to make his borrowing figures look less bad			1
‘ he could n’t bring himself to admit that borrowing was up so far this year but his trickery has now badly backfired			0
’ the @entity6 sale is also embarrassing for the independent @entity70 , which made the £ 3.5 billion forecast , and which has repeatedly got its growth predictions wrong since it was set up in 2010			1
former @entity73 cabinet minister @entity72 said it was unfair to blame the chancellor , adding : ‘ he has made an independent budget office who are meant to know about these things , and i am afraid they have been consistently wrong			0
‘ they have consistently overestimated the growth in the economy and they have consistently overestimated the revenues			0
’ culture secretary @entity86 said the completion of the @entity6 auction six months early would produce a ‘ significant economic boost ’ for the country			1
auction facts : bidders in the 4g sale competed to buy airwaves in two separate bands - the higher frequency 2.6 ghz and lower frequency @entity98 - with 28 lots up for grabs ‘ the benefits will be seen in the @entity15 from the summer onwards as mobile operators deliver competitive high speed mobile broadband services , ’ she said			1
@entity32 said that by 2030 demand for the mobile data could be 80 times higher than today and it was planning for a further spectrum for possible future @entity109 mobile services			0
4g services should make it much quicker to surf the web on mobiles , giving speeds close to home broadband services and allowing consumers to stream high - quality video , watch live tv and download large files			0
for the typical user , download speeds of initial @entity6 networks will be at least five to seven times faster than those for existing 3g networks			1
faster than ever before : how @entity6 compares to 3g this means a music album that takes 20 minutes to download on a 3g phone will take just over three minutes on @entity6			1
meanwhile , @entity15 ’s coveted @entity130 credit rating could come under yet more pressure today as the chancellor struggles to get the country ’s ballooning debts back under control			0
the government borrowed £ 106.5billion in the first nine months of the financial year , which runs from april 2012 to the end of march 2013			2
that is £ 7.2billion or 7.3 per cent more than at the same stage of the previous @entity141 will today reveal how the exchequer fared in january - with many analysts fearing the worst			2
january is a crucial month for the public finances and has recorded a surplus in every year but one since the monthly borrowing records began in 1993			0
it is usually boosted by the payment of corporation tax , capital gains tax and self - assessment income tax but with the economy struggling to recovery revenues are dwindling			0
the surge in borrowing has fuelled fears that @entity15 will be stripped of its gold - plated credit rating in a crushing setback for @entity2			0
@entity159 , an economist at @entity160 , said : ‘ if the figures for january are bad , the chance of a downgrade will increase , although the rating agencies would probably wait to hear what the chancellor announced in the budget before doing anything			0

auction was expected to raise £ *3.5billion* , but bids total just £ *2.3billion*
analyst says low bids *reflect* networks ' status as ' *digital* drug mules '
@entity27 buys biggest *tranche* of @entity6 airwaves for £ *791million*
@entity21 buys second biggest slice with £ *589million* bid
