@entity0 has urged his @entity2 assistant @entity1 to give up being a tv pundit and become a full time coach when he takes a decision on his career in 2016			1
@entity1 , who would be a contender to succeed @entity0 if he were to leave the @entity2 job after @entity8 , has said that he will make a decision next year on whether to opt for the media or football management full time , recognising that he ca n’t keep a foot in both camps indefinitely			1
if @entity0 wished to retire in 2016 and the team had been successful , @entity1 would be a natural replacement as @entity2 manager – but @entity0 hopes that when the time comes he will opt for coaching over his media work with @entity20			1
video coach or journalist ? scroll down for some @entity24 humour on @entity1 's dilemma @entity2 manager @entity0 ( right ) has urged @entity1 to become a full time coach @entity20 pundits ( @entity28 ) @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity1 ‘ from a selfish point of view , thinking about the importance good coaches are going to have in our game , personally would see him more valuable to me as an @entity40 football lover as a coach than as a pundit , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ punditry , to be honest , is not that difficult if you know a little bit about football			2
you do n’t win or lose in punditry			2
you do n’t have to deal with players			2
you do n’t have the daily contact with them , you ’re not coaching them			0
you ’re just watching the game and giving your opinion			0
‘ but the fact that he ’s so good at it , who knows ? maybe he ’ll be under great pressure from @entity20 to keep that up			1
maybe there wo n’t be any jobs that he wants to take			0
if you ’re asking me personally would you like to see @entity1 being a coach or a manger in the future , then of course i would			1
@entity0 and @entity1 attend a @entity66 game earlier this month between @entity67 and @entity68 @entity1 has been @entity2 coach under @entity0 since 2012 , accompanying him to last summer 's @entity69 ‘ he ’d be a loss to @entity2 at the moment because he ’s working with us			1
i do n’t know what he ’ll be doing in future terms			0
i think he ’s a very good coach now			1
he ’ll become an even better coach with experience			1
he ’ll enjoy working with players			0
' i think players will enjoy working with him			0
i think from a selfish coaching orientated point of view i would like to see him in coaching			0
of course , were i in the mass media tv world i ’d be having a completely different argument			0
i ’d be saying : “ he does n’t want to be doing that			0
” ‘ he ’s never actually said to me there is a cut - off point here where i ’ll make a decision			0
but of course we talk a lot about what he wants to do because we talk a lot			0
we ’re together all the time			2
i think he ’s going to become a very fine coach			2
he ’ll become a very fine manager also in time			1
