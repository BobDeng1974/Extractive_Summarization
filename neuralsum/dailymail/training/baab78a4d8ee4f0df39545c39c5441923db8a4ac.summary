by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:00 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 12 march 2013 one of @entity3 's most senior policemen today warned a new generation of ' @entity5 ' could thrive as the @entity3 's legal system puts too much pressure on rape victims			2
sir @entity9 said the @entity3 's courts had become ' adversarial ' towards men and women who suffer sexual abuse and ' exploited weaknesses in their behaviour ' to blame them for their ordeals the 53 - year - old chief constable of @entity18 also said children 's homes would have to be turned into prisons and carers to become wardens to stop runaway girls going missing and falling into the hands of grooming sex gangs			1
it came as @entity28 ’s decades of abuse could have been stopped nearly 50 years ago , a damning inquiry revealed today			2
documents show potentially vital intelligence about his sex crimes was buried in 1964 because he was a celebrity			0
the earliest known allegation against the @entity35 was discovered in a @entity38 @entity37 ledger dating back to that year			2
sir @entity9 , himself a father of four , highlighted the case of violionist @entity54 , 48 , who committed suicide after being cross examined over her sex abuse ordeal at the hands of her former teacher at the @entity60 in @entity61			1
struggle : sir @entity9 chief constable of @entity18 has warned of a new wave of ' @entity65 ' as the @entity3 's legal system put too much pressure on rape victims ' police forces have significantly improved the way that victims are treated but the fact is many , many victims do not come forward or if they do are reluctant to support a prosecution , ' he said			1
' this highlights another issue in the way our adversarial court system treats victims			2
whatever other evidence is collected prosecutions for sexual offences rely hugely on the evidence of the victim			0
' in a case of burglary the victim will not be blamed for leaving the front door unlocked			0
in sexual offences the behaviour of the victim , whether they had been drinking , any weaknesses of character how they were dressed may well be picked over at great length in the court room			0
' this pressure on the victim and the way any weakness will be exploited means that prosecutors and police officers are cautious in taking cases to court '			1
sir @entity9 said the various investigations into the failures to to catch @entity109 did not address ' fundamental underlying issues ' and instead looked to blame individual members of staff			1
he added : ' sexual predators will inevitably pick on vulnerable victims who often have other problems in their lives and suffer from low self - esteem '			0
' we can continue to criticise individual members of staff ( social workers ) for individual failings but this ignores the complexity of these issues and the way that our system of criminal justice affects the victims of sexual offences			0
' today 's report linked @entity131 with young girls at a @entity135 children ’s home but police failed to act on the information			1
two later allegations – from a woman who said @entity28 sexually assaulted her at @entity41 and an anonymous letter branding him a paedophile – were also buried in police files			1
these were classified as ‘ sensitive ’ or marked ‘ restricted ’ by the @entity144 and so were n’t readily available to other forces and hindered the chances of @entity131 facing charges before his death in 2011			0
shame : @entity38 had been told about @entity28 's sex crimes in 1964 but it was buried failure by police to ‘ join the dots ’ meant that the potential for further investigation and a prosecution of @entity28 was missed , @entity152 found in its report mistakes were made			1
forces across @entity3 come under fire for ignoring @entity28 ’s victims and in a shocking warning , @entity152 said there was a ‘ distinct possibility ’ that police could fail to prevent a similar @entity131 scandal			1
the @entity144 launched @entity168 into the allegations against @entity131 last october following an @entity171 documentary exposing him			0
around 450 people came forward making specific claims , with 214 recorded as crimes – including 32 rapes			0
accusations : the 1964 allegation linked @entity28 with young girls at a children 's home in @entity135 , but no action was taken at the time disgraced : around 450 individuals have contacted police with allegations against @entity28 since the launch of @entity168 but when @entity152 asked the 43 police forces in @entity191 and @entity192 to scour their records just five allegations and two pieces of intelligence were recorded against the disgraced star during his lifetime			1
of the five allegations , one victim contacted the @entity144 in 2003 , three went to @entity135 police in 2007 and one to the @entity201 force in 2008			1
police intelligence was limited to the 1964 ledger entry and the record of an anonymous letter that the @entity144 received in 1998 naming @entity28 as a paedophile			1
the 2003 report came from a woman who said she had been assaulted by @entity28 in 1973 , when she was 15 , at a recording of @entity41			2
she said @entity28 put his hand over her bottom and when she objected he replied : ‘ i thought that ’s what you came here for			0
’ the @entity144 did n’t interview @entity28 and marked the record ‘ restricted , ’ said @entity152 , seemingly because of @entity28 ’s celebrity status			0
the classification was to have ‘ a profound effect , ’ said the @entity152 , because it rendered the 2003 report ‘ invisible ’ to @entity135 police when they carried out checks in 2007 after the three claims made to them			1
the 1998 letter was marked ‘ sensitive ’ because of @entity28 ’s celebrity status and because it contained allegations of blackmail and paedophilia			2
it claimed that @entity28 had changed his phone number in @entity228 because a rent boy was trying to blackmail him			0
@entity152 said that had @entity135 police known about the letter and the 2003 complaint , their investigation would have been pursued more vigorously			2
intelligence on the letter was passed to police in @entity228 but @entity152 said it did not have authority to investigate the relationship between @entity241 and @entity131			0
the force has referred the issue of @entity28 ’s contact with one of its former inspectors – over claims he ‘ acted on behalf ’ of @entity28 while the @entity35 was being investigated for sex crimes – to the @entity249			1
@entity251 @entity250 said : ‘ the findings in this report are of deep concern , and clearly there were mistakes in how the police handled the allegations made against @entity28 during his lifetime			1
' however , an equally profound problem is that victims felt unable to come forward and report crimes of sexual abuse			0
it is imperative that all those charged with protecting these victims do more to encourage reporting			0
’ @entity268 , a solicitor from law firm @entity269 who is representing more than 40 of @entity28 ’s victims , said : ‘ its contents demonstrate that the police knew as far back as 1964 that there were allegations that @entity28 was a child abuser			1
‘ over the subsequent years further opportunities to investigate @entity28 were lost , and this was because of the inability to join - up the dots			0
consequently @entity28 was able to carry on regardless duping the country and the price was paid by his many victims			2

sir @entity9 says that too many victims are blamed for their ordeals
' prosecutors and police are cautious in taking cases to court , ' he said
a new inquiry reveal 1964 allegation against @entity28 ignored by police
report linked @entity35 with young girls at a children 's home in @entity302 , @entity135
two later allegations against the late star were also ignored
