@entity0 has been hit by a furious backlash from its own staff for giving a high - profile award to @entity4			1
nearly 200 employees have signed a letter condemning the decision to give the former prime minister a ‘ global legacy award ’ as ‘ morally reprehensible ’ and ‘ a betrayal ’ of the charity ’s principles			1
mr @entity4 was presented with the award – for the last @entity16 government ’s aid spending – by the charity ’s @entity18 arm at a star - studded ceremony in @entity21 last week			1
the letter demands a review of the charity ’s decision - making process which led to the award being given to mr @entity4			1
extracts of the letter published by @entity48 stated : ‘ we consider this award inappropriate and a betrayal to @entity0 ’s founding principles and values			2
' management staff in the region were not communicated with nor consulted about the award and were caught by surprise with this decision			2
’ the award renewed the focus on links between senior figures in the charity and mr @entity4			1
@entity0 ’s @entity64 chief executive is @entity65 , who worked as an adviser for mr @entity4 for three years and then for @entity67			1
@entity68 , who was mr @entity4 ’s chief of staff , is on the board of directors of @entity70			1
one of the charity ’s senior managers sent an email last week commenting on the backlash , and admitting the charity had received a ‘ high volume of complaints and negative reactions ’ regarding the award			2
global media manager @entity80 accepted that mr @entity4 was a ‘ hugely controversial and divisive figure in many parts of the world ’			1
she also listed questions received by outraged staff members asking why @entity70 would hand out one of its most prestigious awards ‘ to a man accused of being a war criminal ’			2
hero dog : @entity92 , or rather her latest incarnation , was also among the guests at the sumptuous gala event @entity97 - studded bash : ( from left ) mr @entity4 , @entity98 of the @entity99 , actress @entity100 , and @entity102 - winning journalist @entity101 at the event in @entity21 two former aides of @entity4 have significant roles in @entity70			1
poverty adviser to @entity4 : @entity65 @entity65 , who worked in @entity107 from 2004 to 2010 , is chief executive of @entity0			2
and 12 months ago , @entity68 , mr @entity4 ’s chief of staff throughout his time in power , was appointed to the board of @entity70			1
mr @entity65 was recruited by mr @entity4 to work in @entity107 as an adviser on poverty and climate change			1
he worked on the government ’s aid agenda , including the @entity118 campaign			0
mr @entity65 worked for @entity119 before entering no 10 , and stayed on after mr @entity4 left as @entity67 ’s director of strategic communications and campaigns			1
@entity68 , former chief of staff he was appointed as @entity0 @entity64 ’s chief executive soon after the @entity123 in september 2010			0
mr @entity65 attracted controversy two years ago when @entity0 warned some parents in the @entity64 could not afford hot meals and shoes for their children			0
the @entity129 accused him of turning the charity into a political organisation			0
his pay packet was also criticised last year when it emerged he was paid £ 163,000 a year			0
it has since fallen to £ 140,000			0
as mr @entity4 ’s chief of staff , mr @entity68 was among his most senior advisers , and played a key role in the @entity138 peace process			1
mr @entity4 was presented with the award last wednesday at an ‘ @entity140 ’ at the @entity26 in @entity21			1
the ceremony ’s guest of honour hobnobbed with @entity31 stars including @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity100			0
he was praised for his ‘ leadership on international development ’ and the charity pointed to two major summits on debt relief for poor countries during his premiership			0
accepting the award , mr @entity4 said : ‘ from the beginning of humankind there has been brutality , conflict , intrigue , the destructive obsession with a narrow self - interest			1
‘ but throughout all human history , never has been extinguished that relentless , unquenchable desire to do good			0
to act not only in self - interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it			0
’ mr @entity4 set @entity64 on course to meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid			1
but critics of the ballooning aid budget – which hit £ 11.4billion last year – say the target is arbitrary , warn huge increases in spending will lead to waste , and point out that money is going to @entity175 , a country with its own space programme			0
much of the opposition to mr @entity4 centres on his decision to take @entity64 to war in @entity180			1
but his consultancy work for the autocratic president of @entity183 has led to opposition leaders in the former @entity186 state saying he has ‘ blood on his hands ’			0
mr @entity4 is said to have earned millions of pounds advising @entity190 , who has ruled the former @entity186 republic since 1989 , on how to ‘ spin ’ a massacre of civilians by his regime			2
last night a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ contrary to some reports , the award was not awarded by @entity0 or @entity65 , its @entity64 ceo			0
it was given to @entity4 last week by @entity0 @entity18 at their gala event in @entity21			2
‘ he received the award because of his work on @entity204 and poverty when prime minister			0
he led the @entity208 nations at @entity209 to agree a doubling of aid to @entity204 , debt cancellation and universal access to @entity215 treatment			0
‘ in a global organisation like ours of thousands of people , our staff have strong views on a whole range of issues and people and we respect that diversity of views			0
’ in a lengthy criticism of @entity48 posted on the website of @entity230 of @entity4 last night , a spokesman said : ‘ the award was in recognition of @entity4 ’s work in leading @entity208 nations at @entity209 in 2005 to pledge to double aid to @entity204 and provide 100 per cent debt relief to eligible countries , as well as his ongoing work in partnership with @entity204 governments through his foundation , the @entity242 ( @entity242 )			2
‘ it is extraordinary that while ignoring the body of work undertaken by @entity4 , the @entity242 and the people they work alongside in @entity204 governments			0
the article also sought to traduce the reputation of @entity70 , and was neither balanced nor fair			0
