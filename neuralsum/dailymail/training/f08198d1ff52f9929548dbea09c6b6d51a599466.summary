by @entity0 instead of counting calories , those seeking to stay slim are better off enjoying a protein rich diet and eating fish , eggs and meat , scientists have found			1
because of the way the human body prioritises protein over carbohydrates and fat , those with a diet low in protein are likely to gorge on these other food groups to reach the target protein level			1
over the past 60 years the proportion of protein in @entity20 diets has dropped , and researchers suggest this could account for soaring levels of obesity			1
professor @entity45 is set to present his findings today at the @entity49 in @entity50 , and says they may explain why high protein diets such as the @entity53 can help people to lose weight			1
however , he warned such diets could lead to further health issues , as it was more important to achieve the correct nutritional balance			0
@entity60 avoided : professor @entity45 says our bodies are not adapted to biscuits , cakes , pizzas and sugary drinks ' we also need to get the balance of fats to carbs right , ' he said			0
' high protein diets might help us to lose weight , but if they involve other imbalances then other health problems will be introduced			2
' as well as being a good source of energy , protein is essential for the healthy growth and repair of body tissues , such as muscles including the heart , internal organs and skin			1
@entity84 and chicken breast fish such as tuna and salmon low - fat cheese varieties such as cottage cheese or mozzarella @entity92 lean beef and veal @entity95 beans eggs yoghurt , milk and soy milk nuts and seeds professor @entity45 's team studied baboons living on the edge of human settlements , and found that despite eating different combinations of foods every day the apes achieved a consistent balance where 20 per cent of their energy needs came from protein			1
other studies found that spider monkeys and orang - utans , too , foraged for a balanced diet			2
but when seasonal availability of some foods prevented them from getting a balanced diet , they prioritised getting the right amount of protein even if this meant eating too much or too little fats and carbohydrates			1
the researchers concluded that measuring a food 's nutritional content by its calorie count was too simplistic , and that overall achieving the correct nutritional balance of proteins , carbohydrates and fats was more important			0
when foods are nutritionally balanced , there is no competition between these appetite systems , and when one nutrient requirement is satisfied , so too are the others			0
many foods however , are unbalanced and have a higher or lower proportion of protein to carbohydrate than is required			2
therefore , to obtain the right amount of protein it may be necessary to over or under - eat fats and carbohydrates			1
the researchers are currently investigating how the balance of carbohydrates and fats affects the health of laboratory mice			0
professor @entity45 concluded with his own advice for dietary health			0
' a simple rule for healthy eating is to avoid processed foods – the closer to real foods the better , ' he said			0
' whilst it is clear that humans are generalist feeders , no human population has until recently encountered " ultra-processed foods " – made from industrially extracted sugars , starches and salt			0
our bodies and appetites are not adapted to biscuits , cakes , pizzas and sugary drinks and we eat too much of them at our peril			2

those with a diet low in protein likely to gorge on carbohydrates and fat
proportion of protein in @entity20 diets has dropped - which could account for obesity levels
*poeple* must eat enough protein to satisfy appetites , scientists say
protein is essential for the healthy growth and repair of body tissues
