a @entity1 panelist caused his co-hosts to squirm today as he implied that sexual assault was to blame for why @entity5 's nudists prefer to live their lives in the buff			1
during today 's live broadcast of @entity10 , @entity8 was seated with the usual hosts as they weighed the issue of the proposed nudity ban in @entity5			1
' but @entity8 's opinion on the matter was a tad more extreme : ' most of them were gang banged probably			0
while his stunned co-hosts cringed , @entity8 added : ' i do nâ€™t know - they could have had sexual assault on them			0
' nude protest : a naked demonstrator sits on the steps of @entity51 in @entity5 as the ban was voted on by the council equally stunned were viewers who took to @entity55 to voice their outrage over @entity8 's comments			1
one user tweeted : ' i wonder if [ @entity14 ] is proud to sit & made to shut up next to the misogynist men on [ @entity1 ]			2
' another suggested that @entity8 has ' evolved from the village idiot			0
' one more suggested that @entity8 's remark earns him the distinction of the ' @entity66 of @entity1			2
' hours after @entity8 's outburst , @entity5 lawmakers narrowly approved a proposal to ban public nakedness , rejecting arguments that the measure would eat away at a reputation for tolerance enjoyed by a city known for flouting convention and flaunting its counter-culture image			1
the 6 - 5 board of supervisors vote means that exposed genitals will be prohibited in most public places , including streets , sidewalks and public transit			0
supervisor @entity85 introduced the measure in response to escalating complaints about a group of men whose lack of clothing was an almost daily occurrence in the city 's predominantly gay @entity94			0
opposition : @entity98 holds up a sign protesting the board of supervisors ' ban on public nudity a man undresses at @entity104 in @entity5 , @entity105 october 30 ' the @entity94 and @entity5 in general , is a place of freedom , expression and acceptance			1
but freedom , expression and acceptance does not mean anything goes under any circumstances , ' @entity85 said on tuesday			0
' our public spaces are for everyone and as a result it 's appropriate to have some minimal standards of behavior			0
' @entity122 's opponents on the board said a citywide ban would draw police officers ' attention away from more critical problems and eat away at city 's reputation for tolerance			2
a nude man carries a sign at @entity104 in @entity5 , @entity105 october 30 covered up : an officer rushes to put clothing on @entity135 after the ban was narrowly approved ' i 'm concerned about civil liberties , about free speech , about changing @entity5 's style and how we are as a city , ' supervisor @entity137 said			1
under @entity122 's proposal , a first offense would carry a maximum penalty of a $ 100 fine , but prosecutors would have authority to charge a third violation as a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $ 500 fine and a year in jail			2
exemptions would be made for participants at permitted street fairs and parades , such as the city 's annual gay pride event and the @entity158 , which celebrates sadomasochism and other sexual subcultures			0
a federal lawsuit claiming the ban would violate the free speech rights of people who prefer to make a statement by going au naturel was filed last week in case the ordinance passes			1
