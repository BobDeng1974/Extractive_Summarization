a new mobile home that has a movable interior wall is set to revolutionise the humble caravan holiday			1
the @entity4 measures just 30ft by 13ft , but the cutting - edge design allows the same area to be used for different functions at different times			2
during the day , the sliding bedroom wall is pushed back , freeing up an extra 60sqft of room to create an impressive open - plan living space that has room for a 10 - seater dining table			2

on the other side of the wall there are two concealed , single bunk beds that can be folded down when the wall has been pulled back			0
with fixed triple bunk beds on one end of the caravan and a sofa in the lounge doubling as a bed , what should be a six berth mobile home becomes one for ten people			0
the only permanent room that does n't change in size is the bathroom and toilet			0

at night , the wall comes out and with it a foldaway bed to form a comfortable double bedroom it will also mean holiday parks will have more space available on site to fit more caravans as they can do away with much bigger , four bed units for 10 people it will also mean holiday parks will have more space available on site to fit more caravans as they can do away with much bigger , four bed units although it is just a prototype , the clever caravan is tipped to be the future of ' staycation ' holidays			1

@entity79 , a director at @entity17 , said : ' we wanted to design a caravan that utilises the space in a different way			1
' in a normal caravan , a bedroom is a bedroom 24 hours a day			0
but for 16 hours it is a 10ft by 13ft of space that is not is use			0
with fixed triple bunk beds on one end of the caravan and a sofa in the lounge doubling as a bed , what should be a six berth mobile home becomes one for nine people the movable bedroom wall is pushed back , freeing up an extra 60sq ft of room to create and impressive open - plan living space that has room for a 10 seater dining table ' if you close the bedroom up when it is not being used you can use that space for a different purpose			1
' we have used the same sort of technology that a large document filing storage unit uses to be able to move a central wall to open and close the bedroom space when it is needed			2
' we have come up with a genius van that has space for nine holiday makers to sleep , dine , relax or entertain themselves , all in a holiday home that measures only 30ft x 13ft			0
behind the main bedroom are two concealed , single bunk beds that fold down			0
there are also three fixed bunk beds at one end of the caravan the only permanent room that does n't change in size is the bathroom and toilet although it is a prototype , the clever caravan is tipped to be the future of ' staycation ' holidays ' the key to the design is using the same space for different functions at different times			1
' to allow for this we added pull down beds , a triple bunk bed , an extendable dining table that packs away when not in use , kitchen work - tops hidden in drawers , a cinema screen that drops down from the ceiling and walls that move at the push of a button			1
' we have received some great feedback and ca n't wait to start encapsulating the ideas into our collections over the coming years			0

the @entity4 has been designed by @entity17 in @entity47
the movable wall creates extra an 60sq ft of space with a cinema screen
although only a prototype , its makers will use the design in future caravans
