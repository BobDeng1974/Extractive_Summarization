by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 will continue to ' tighten the screw ' on @entity5 with increased sanctions unless it pulls back from eastern @entity7 , @entity2 warned today			1
the foreign secretary admitted @entity3 will suffer some economic pain from trade embargoes with @entity5 , but insisted : ' you ca n't make an omelette without breaking eggs			1
' the @entity14 last night agreed a new crackdown on against vast sectors of the @entity5 economy , designed to cripple its banks , energy firms and defence capabilities			1
@entity5 president @entity22 will continue to be targeted with economic sanctions until he behaves ' properly ' , the @entity3 government has warned the @entity14 imposed an arms embargo , banking curbs and a ban on trade in sensitive and dual - use technologies to punish @entity5 for its actions in its neighbouring country			1
a further eight @entity5 will also face asset freezes and travel bans			2
global pressure is mounting on @entity5 to co-operate with the investigation into the downing of @entity38 flight @entity36			1
the international community believes it was shot down by @entity41 separatists in eastern @entity7 , almost certainly using a missile from @entity5			2
there are growing calls for mr @entity22 to stop the supply of dangerous and sophisticated weapons into the hands of semi-trained separatists			0
but mr @entity2 insisted the latest round of sanctions was not the end of it , and @entity3 would continue to ' ratchet ' up pressure on @entity54 until @entity22 behaves ' properly '			1
foreign secretary @entity2 admitted @entity3 will suffer some economic pain from trade embargoes with @entity5 he told @entity57 : ' this is a tough new set of sanctions which we ’ve led the way on getting agreed in @entity62			1
' the whole idea is to have a ratchet here			0
every time something happens , every time the @entity5 fail to respond to international demands , we will tighten the screw a little bit more			2
' mr @entity69 admitted that the @entity3 economy would also take a hit as a result of the econmic crackdown , but insisted : ' the sanctions package is designed to hurt @entity5 more than it hurts us , but it would be absurd to suggest that we could impose wide - ranging on the @entity5 economy without also having some impact on ourselves			1
' but if we are going to take a stand against @entity5 aggression , if we are going to insist on @entity5 behaving like a civilised nation in the modern world then we have to be prepared to pay the price for doing that			2
' he later told @entity86 that the measures had been ' designed to maximise the impact on @entity5 and minimise the impact on @entity14 economies '			1
he later but he added : ' you ca n't make an omelette without breaking eggs , and if we want to impose economic pain on @entity5 in order to try to encourage it to behave properly in eastern @entity7 and to give access to the crash site , then we have to be prepared to take these measures			2
' the @entity100 swiftly followed up the @entity14 's announcement with a fresh round of sanctions of its own , targeting three @entity5 banks			1
@entity106 president @entity105 said : ' today @entity5 is once again isolating itself from the international community , setting back decades of genuine progress			2
' it does not have to be this way			0
this a choice @entity5 and president @entity22 has made			2
' @entity112 yesterday met families of @entity3 victims of the atrocity , as he warned @entity5 has failed to stem the flow of weapons across the border to @entity7 since a surface - to - air missile was used to destroy flight @entity36 , killing all 298 people on board			1
@entity123 , whose 28 - year - old son @entity124 died in the july 17 crash , said : ' we basically asked mr @entity112 just to help			0
the talking i suppose has got to stop and the doing has got to be done			0
' i feel very angry and frustrated			0
it would be nice if they could just stop fighting for a little bit so that we could get all our boys and girls home			0
' @entity123 , whose son @entity124 was among 10 @entity3 killed in the atrocity , is pictured arriving at @entity138 for the meeting with @entity112 mr @entity123 , whose son @entity124 was among 10 @entity3 killed in the atrocity , said he was meeting the prime minister ' under not very nice circumstances ' the prime minister said : ‘ we must do everything we can to make that crash site is properly managed ; that their loved ones are brought home and that everything that can be done on that front is being done			2
’ mr @entity112 added : ' the sanctions really relate to @entity22 's and @entity5 's behaviour , and we want to make it absolutely clear that @entity5 's behaviour in destabilising another country - @entity7 - is unacceptable			1
' @entity62 's arms embargo will block any trade with @entity5 in weapons or ' related material '			1
with its own major arms industry stemming from the era of @entity164 isolation , @entity5 has little need to import weapons from the @entity14 , but sells more than 3billion euros worth a year to member states			1
however , the embargo will apply only to future contracts , so one big deal that wo n't be affected is the heavily criticised 1.2billion - euro sale of two @entity173 helicopter carriers to @entity5 , which has already been agreed			1
the @entity14 's banking curbs are a more significant step			1
they will deny @entity5 's state - owned banks access to @entity62 capital markets by banning @entity62 from buying their bonds , equities or financial instruments with a higher maturity than 90 days			1
global pressure is mounting on @entity5 to co-operate with the investigation into the downing of @entity38 flight @entity36 the measures were agreed as world aviation chiefs set up a ' senior level ' international task force to deal with the threat to passenger planes following the downing of flight @entity36			2
a top - level safety conference involving more than 190 nations will also take place in february under the auspices of the @entity198 ( @entity198 )			0
following a meeting of global aviation bodies in @entity202 , @entity198 's secretary general @entity199 said all the aviation bodies ' strongly condemned the use of weapons against the civilian aircraft '			0
@entity208 president @entity207 said the new @entity14 sanctions had been imposed after @entity5 ignored calls to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis in @entity7 , with arms and fighters continuing to flow across the border in support of the @entity41 separatist rebels			1
' it is meant as a strong warning : illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilisation of a neighbouring sovereign country can not be accepted in 21st century @entity62 , ' he said			0
' furthermore , when the violence created spirals out of control and leads to the killing of almost 300 innocent civilians in their flight from the @entity230 to @entity231 , the situation requires an urgent and determined response			0
' meanwhile , @entity106 secretary of state @entity233 accused separatist rebels in eastern @entity7 of showing ' an appalling disrespect for human decency ' in carrying on fighting close to the site where @entity239 crashed after apparently being shot out of the sky by a surface - to - air missile			2
the fact that not all the remains of the 298 victims of the disaster had yet been recovered had placed ' an unsupportable burden on families ' , who ' clearly deserve a thorough , international investigation ' , mr @entity233 said in a @entity251 press conference			0
signs were emerging of concern in the @entity254 about the possible blowback sanctions on @entity5 could inflict on the @entity3 economy			1
energy giant @entity257 - which owns a 20 per cent stake in @entity5 oil firm @entity259 - warned that further international sanctions could have a ' material adverse impact ' on the company 's business in @entity5 and its own financial position			1
