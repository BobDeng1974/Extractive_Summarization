@entity0 have decided not to send @entity1 for surgery on his dislocated shoulder , meaning the @entity5 defender could be back in action within six weeks			1
it was feared that @entity1 could be sidelined for up to three months after he was carried off in the second half of last weekend ’s @entity10 derby			1
manager @entity11 confirmed that @entity0 hope to cure the problem with rest , but admitted that there is a worry that @entity1 could suffer a recurrence of the dislocation in future			1
‘ because it ’s a conservative way it can be less than six weeks and when we have to operate it ’s 12 weeks			1
‘ maybe with this injury it is very difficult that it wo n’t happen again , and that ’s the problem			2
yesterday another specialist said that the conservative way to heal it is the best			2
but we have always the risk it will happen again			2
‘ it ’s always the same with this injury , i can not change that			2
the human body has been made by @entity39 not by me			2
’ @entity40 celebrates scoring @entity42 's winning goal against @entity0 last weekend @entity24 hands out instructions to @entity44 during their 1 - 0 defeat by @entity42 last sunday @entity24 's players look dejected during the @entity10 derby at the @entity47 with @entity48 suspended and @entity49 ( ankle ) and @entity51 ( shin splints ) still injured , @entity24 refused to confirm if @entity53 will play in central defence at home to @entity56 on saturday			1
the @entity58 midfielder filled in as an emergency centre - back when @entity48 was sent off in the defeat at @entity42 and finished the game playing alongside @entity62 following @entity1 ’s injury			1
‘ i do n’t want to say what i ’m thinking to do , ’ added the @entity0 boss			0
‘ @entity48 is not playing because he is suspended , and @entity51 and @entity49 are still injured			1
i have to solve that problem			0
who is playing there i do n’t want to say			0
maybe i can train today and change my mind , because i have to solve that problem			0
@entity24 refused to confirm whether @entity53 ( left ) would start at centre back on saturday the @entity74 boss gives instructions to his players during a training session on friday @entity24 also defended his team ’s defensive record , claiming that it has been blemished by the 5 - 3 defeat at @entity81 in september			1
‘ i do n’t agree with the opinion about the defence , ’ he said			0
‘ when you do n’t count the five goals of @entity81 , we have ( conceded ) less than @entity87 i believe			0
the balance of the team is the problem			0
that is why i have remodelled the structure of my team for the third time			0
’ @entity0 ’s injury problems also mean that @entity96 will also miss his third game in a row with a calf strain			0
the @entity101 striker started his last game , the 2 - 2 draw at @entity104 last month , on the bench but @entity24 denied that he is losing faith in a player who could end costing @entity0 in excess of £ 50million if they make his loan move from @entity110 permanent			1
@entity96 will miss the game against @entity56 with a calf strain @entity48 is suspended for the @entity56 match following his sending off last weekend ‘ the problem for @entity96 is that because of the balance in the ( @entity104 ) game , i had to change and after that moment he has come in the game and assisted for a goal			0
then in a training session he has been injured			1
‘ i can not judge him now because now he is injured and i have changed him ( left him out ) not because of his performance but because the balance of the team			2
