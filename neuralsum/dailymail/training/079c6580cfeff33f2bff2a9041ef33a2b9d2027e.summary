@entity1 's boyfriend today admitted police suspect drugs were at the home they shared when she drowned			1
@entity7 made the disclosure in legal papers as he brought - then dropped - an attempt to stop police seizing security camera footage from the property where she was found face down in her bath tub on the morning of january 31			1
the home in @entity17 , @entity18 , was owned by @entity1 's mother @entity19 at the time she died three years ago			1
@entity7 , 25 , who had been in a tempestuous relationship with her for several years and claimed to have married her , sought a temporary restraining order to prevent police acting on a search warrant involving a security camera			1
he had applied to @entity28 to stop the company which owns the camera system - nest - from complying with the warrant , issued on february 12th			0
@entity7 is trying to stop police accessing them as they investigate suspicions of drugs at the property secured : @entity44 cameras are present throughout the gated community			1
@entity7 has an account with the web - based loggerheads : @entity7 ( left ) is seen the only time he has been at hospital where @entity1 is being treated			1
he claims @entity50 ( right ) has banned him and that money lies at the root of the feud			2
@entity7 holds a ' dropcam ' account with @entity56 - based company nest who operate security surveillance equipment			2
today he dropped the case , just as it emerged in public			2
in a statement , his lawyers @entity61 and @entity63 said : ' to protect his client 's interests , mr @entity61 filed the @entity67			0
' however , mr @entity7 has since elected to dismiss the claim in an effort to help @entity70 speed up their investigation			2
' however the court papers gave an unprecedented insight into the investigation by @entity75 , confirming for the first time that they suspect drugs were on the property			1
the documents say ' there is an insufficient link between the crime alleged in the search warrant , specifically ' possession of a controlled substance			0
' the court papers state : ' a drop cam allows plug and play operation of security cameras and stores the data that it collects on " cloud ' servers so that the data may be accessed at any time anywhere from an internet connection after logging in to a secure site '			1
court documents filed on his behalf said : ' @entity103 violates the @entity104 in that it is overly broad and seeks private data without limitation			0
' ( it ) fails to narrowly limit the scope of the data sought by date or other characteristics			0
' it adds : ' @entity114 , @entity115 , is a customer of @entity116 , ( which ) owns and operates a ' dropcam ' web - based security company			0
' on february 12 , 2015 , @entity116 notified via email its customer , @entity115 â€¦ that it had received ' legal process ' for data and documents related to the account and that it intended to comply			0
' case : @entity7 ( above ) who has been photographed waving a hand gun in the air while driving , claims the police quest to access the camera system 's records is a breach of his privacy @entity7 , who has been photographed with a hand gun , claims the police quest to access the camera is a breach of his privacy			1
police are treating @entity1 's injuries and near drowning as a criminal investigation			1
but @entity7 's claim says : ' privacy , in the context of stored information includes the right to control how stored information is communicated and prevent its abuse			2
' lt is more than just confidentiality of data			0
the @entity104 implicitly governs in its very core that @entity151 have a reasonable expectation of privacy which inherently extends to the right to control their own data and access thereto			0
@entity7 's claim confirm for the first time that police suspect narcotics may have been illegally used on the night of january 30/31			1
police have given little information about what they believed may have happened to @entity1 and the lead up to her emergency			2
@entity158 spokeswoman @entity164 said : ' the matter may or may not result in criminal charges being brought against individuals			0
' this remains an active investigation and the @entity158 has no further statement or information to release at this time			0
' @entity7 's move to protect his privacy is another twist in what has become an increasingly hostile situation between him , @entity1 's father the singer @entity50 and members of @entity19 's family			1
' grow up ' : @entity7 uploaded a screenshot of text messages he allegedly sent to @entity50			1
in them he insisted @entity1 will hate her father when she wakes up motivation : the 22 - year - old claims the @entity1 family only want the money from @entity189 parenting : @entity7 accused @entity50 of virtually deserting his daughter during the rant hope : @entity1 's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically - induced coma she has been in for the last three weeks @entity7 has been banned from visiting @entity1 's bedside at an @entity196 hospital unless he gives her family the full and unequivocal rundown on what happened to her			1
he has been mouthing off in @entity200 against his girlfriend 's father questioning his standing as a parent and how much he actually saw and cared for her			0
the singer is said to be ' distraught beyond measure ' over his daughters condition and praying for her to come out of her coma			0
@entity1 , the only daughter of the @entity210 has been hospitalized in @entity196 since being found unresponsive on january 31 in a tub at her @entity18 home			1
police said @entity7 was performing cpr when emergency responders arrived at the home			2
a new report which surfaced on saturday claimed that @entity1 was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub			1
in addition to this , she had been using cocaine , heroin and @entity227 in the months before the january 31 incident , according to multiple sources who spoke to people			0
@entity1 had also been ' in and out ' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed , and still was ' distraught ' over her mother 's death three years ago			2
one of the sources who regularly saw the 21 - year - old said @entity1 seemed to frequently be ' high ' and was often ' slurring her words '			2
she has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital last month after being found by @entity7			0
@entity1 , left , and @entity7 pictured in 2012			1
@entity7 has been barred by her father , @entity1 , from seeing her in hospital until he reveals what happened before she was found unconscious in a bathtub on january 31 @entity7 and @entity1 referred to each other as husband and wife , but father @entity50 said they never legally married			1
last week , she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy			0
few details about the young woman 's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital , and her father , the rapper and former member of @entity258 , has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter 's condition			0
earlier this week @entity7 used @entity200 to claim @entity1 has hardly seen the 21 - year - old in years before her accident and is only interested in the family 's money			1
the 22 - year - old told @entity50 to ' grow up ' - insisting his daughter will hate him when she wakes up			2
the angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the @entity1 family told @entity7 he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before she was found face down in a bathtub			1
sign of affection : @entity7 tweeted this picture of an apparently new tattoo on his arm on @entity282 @entity7 also insisted he has taken care of her ' 24/7 ' since her mother died in 2012			0
on monday , he first tweeted : ' okay , so i 'll probably get in trouble for this , ' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent @entity50			0
the first , underneath a picture of the new @entity1 tattoo on his right arm , read : ' man to man i love your daughter			0
' he added : ' i do n't know why you wo n't let me see her			0
your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up			0
' @entity7 claimed : ' @entity50 seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs ' and added : ' now him and his family want @entity303 $ $ which belongs to @entity305 or @entity306			1
