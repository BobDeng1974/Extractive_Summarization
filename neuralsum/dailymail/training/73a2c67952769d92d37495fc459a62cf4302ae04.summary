by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 16:46 est , 4 october 2013 graffiti artists are used to hiding while they daub their works on walls as being caught would mean a telling off from the police			1
but one @entity6 street - art duo have taken things a step further and started hiding their artwork as well			1
painted on the side of railings and steps , these fantastic images can only be viewed from certain angles , effectively hiding them in plain sight			1
@entity18 are a @entity6 street art duo who have been decorating railings and steps across @entity21 with their tick - of - the - eye paintings the wonderful artworks appear mostly in @entity6 in city such as @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 speedy : the works are made using spray paint and glue and take just 30 minutes to create from the right point of view this bridge turns into a stunning portrait of a young woman the artists behind these human portraits are male and female duo who go by the name ' zebrating ' and are touring @entity6 cities with their spray paints in a bid to jazz up boring street railings			1
' everybody can see our art when they 're passing by , but the way we 've designed it makes it only accessible to the people who walk around with open eyes , ' said @entity51			0
' for our art you have to change your point of view , and take a few steps back to see it right			0
' much like rotating billboard adverts , the pictures only appear when viewed from a certain angle seen from a different point of view the picture slowly disappears and from the reverse angle nothing can be seen the duo , who go by the name of @entity18 , said they were inspired to do it by the ' boring ' railings the paintings take half an hour to make each so this set of bars represents two and a half hours work @entity18 have left their mark on various cities such as @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , and even travelled to @entity73 in order to try to spread their passion of street art. these masterpieces are made purely from spray paint and paste and only take 30 minutes to create , with the artists working against the clock to leave unseen			1
' we had this big idea of what we wanted to do			0
we both recognised the hidden and still idle places perfect for street art , such as fences and railings			2
at first glance what might look like ordinary road railings are in fact amazing works of art the artists use mathematical trigonometry to work out how to divide up their paintings across the railings despite several run - ins with the police that has n't stopped zebrating artwork from springing up as well as @entity6 the creative couple have taken their art abroad to @entity73 , a city known for its street artists ' they are always so grey and boring ; we wanted to brighten up peoples journeys a bit			1
to make it happen , we needed a little bit of trigonometry knowledge and the courage to do it			0
' another street artist also on tour at the moment is world - renowned pioneer @entity117 , who has vowed to put up a new artwork in @entity121 every day until the end of october			0
the show , entitled @entity124 , has seen three works spring up on walls in the city 's art district			2
like most street artists @entity18 operate under the cloak of anonymity for fear of being caught their paintings mostly feature young women but also include male faces and eyeballs @entity18 say people are confused by their works at first , but when they work out the trick they are always amazed the latest , a dog urinating on a fire hydrant with a speech bubble which says ' you complete me ' , has already attracted a huge crowd			2
@entity117 shows are usually public and free for all , though his pieces are often hijacked by collectors who go on to sell them for hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
the @entity152 - born artist has never been identified and , like most graffiti artists including @entity18 , maintains an air of secrecy			2
another graffiti artist on tour at the moment is @entity117 who has vowed to put up a new work in @entity121 every day for a month the show is called @entity124 and includes work on walls in @entity121 's art district			0
