is he or is n't he ? new research could end the misery of trying to read the signs of someone 's sexual orientation			1
scientists say a person 's pupil will shoot open when they become aroused , helping those on the prowl know whether or not they will get lucky			2
eye - le ! the secrets of a person 's sexuality is hidden in their eyes , a new study reveals pupil dilation has long been known to track the level of someone 's excitement			1
pupils open slightly when a person sees a puppy dog or a friendly face			0
but now researchers say reading optical reflexes could solve the conundrum of guessing which team a person is playing for			0
the sex study , conducted by dr @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity33 , monitored 165 men and 160 women , including gay , straight and bisexual participants			1
the subjects ' pupils were studied as they screened one - minute videos of a man masturbating , a woman masturbating and neutral landscape scenes			0
optical disclosure : new research from @entity33 suggests pupil dilation is an accurate indicator of sexual orientation straight men reacted to sexual images of women , gay men responded to sexual images of men and bisexuals respond to both men and women , the results showed			1
but women , in traditional fashion , were far more complex			0
gay females had pupil dilation after seeing sexual images of other women but straight women dilated similarly in response to erotic images of both sexes			1
this does n't mean that all straight women are secretly bisexual , dr @entity31 warned , just that their subjective arousal does n't necessarily match their body 's arousal			0
sex researchers ca n't explain why this would be but some theorize the response is a survival mechanism given the risk of female rape			0
a woman 's body could respond to a sexual stimulus , regardless of its appeal , for her own protection			2
the next phase of the study would be monitoring pupil measurements and genital measurements simultaneously , though researchers admitted some subjects get a little squeamish having their genitals under scrutiny .			2

@entity33 research shows pupil dilation may indicate sexual *inclinations*
