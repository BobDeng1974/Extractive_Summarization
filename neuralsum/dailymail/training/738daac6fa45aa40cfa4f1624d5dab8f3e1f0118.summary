disgraced @entity1 owner @entity0 has spoken out for the first time since he was fined $ 2.5 million and banned for life by the @entity4 for racist comments that shocked the basketball community			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity7 of upmarket @entity9 magazine , telling the publisher that he has no intention of selling the team and that he believes he could have avoided the controversy if he had paid @entity14 off			1
speaking of reported former girlfriend @entity14 , who allegedly recorded and released audio of @entity0 's tirade , @entity0 said , ' i wish i had just paid her off			2
' happier times : @entity0 , seen here with @entity14 in 2011 , has said he believes he could have avoided his racism controversy if he 'd ' just paid her off ' payroll : @entity14 lives in a million - dollar condo and is often seen out with ostentatious handbags , emerging from one of several luxury cars , all allegedly purchased by @entity28 the excerpt adds that @entity0 ' expressed remorse ' during the interview , but gave no further detail			1
@entity0 also told @entity7 that he 's not planning to do any further interviews on the subject - though he is willing to speak with @entity35 and to the @entity4			1
alleged interview : it 's not clear how in - depth the ' exclusive discussion ' @entity7 ( pictured ) had with @entity0 delves into the @entity14 debacle @entity7 is the publisher of @entity9 , once described by the @entity40 as ' a magazine for the wealthy			1
' subscribers must meet a criteria of wealth before they are added to the publication 's mailing list			0
he also publishes such niche publications as @entity49 and @entity50			0
the @entity4 on thursday launched its bid to oust @entity0 as owner of the @entity1 for racist comments as a panel of 10 fellow team owners or their proxies unanimously agreed to proceed ' as expeditiously as possible , ' the @entity4 said			1
the decision , reached during a telephone conference call of the @entity4 board of governors ' advisory - finance committee , seemed to indicate a strong base of support among @entity63 's fellow owners for his removal , as urged by league commissioner @entity66			2
silver on tuesday declared @entity0 banned from the @entity4 for life , fined him $ 2.5 million - the league maximum - and called on the 29 other club owners who make up the governing board to exercise their authority to force @entity28 to sell the @entity1			1
the unprecedented move would require a three - fourths majority vote under the league 's constitution and bylaws			0
if approved , the board could then go further still and vote to seize ownership of the team for the @entity4 itself to sell , cutting @entity28 out of the negotiations			2
embattled : despite a lifetime ban from the @entity4 , @entity0 has indicated that he has no intention to sell the @entity1 the decision came hours before sports network @entity86 and other media reported @entity0 has been battling prostate cancer			1
@entity90 could not independently confirm the reports			0
silver and at least two of the owners , including the interim chairman of the board , @entity94 of the @entity95 , have expressed confidence they could muster the votes necessary to force a sale			0
the teams represented in thursday 's initial strategy session were @entity95 , the @entity102 , the @entity103 , the @entity104 , the @entity105 , the @entity106 , the @entity107 , and @entity108 , the @entity109 and the @entity110			0
in a brief statement , the @entity4 said the panel discussed terminating @entity0 's ownership and ' unanimously agreed to move forward as expeditiously as possible			1
' it said the panel would reconvene next week			0
the committee 's decision was in line with an outpouring of support expressed by the owners as a whole for @entity66 following tuesday 's announcement of a ban			2
saving face : @entity14 has been seen about town in numerous revealing ensembles , but rarely without a face - shielding visor constant scrutiny : @entity14 , seen here out the front of her home with a pet turtle , denies leaking the recorded audio but experts have suggested that some of @entity28 's fellow owners might be hesitant to support action they felt could set a precedent weakening their own future property rights			0
@entity0 , who bought the @entity1 in 1981 for $ 13 million when the team was based in @entity141 , has not indicated whether he would relinquish ownership without putting up a fight			1
experts have estimated that the franchise , which moved to @entity146 in 1984 , could now be worth as much as $ 1 billion , posing an enormous potential capital gains tax liability on @entity28 if he were to sell the team			0
a number of legal scholars and sports business analysts have said they expect @entity28 and the @entity4 to be on a collision course that will be fought out in court			0
' the guy has a reputation for being highly litigious			0
i just ca n't possibly imagine him rolling over and handing the team over and not fighting back , ' said @entity159 , a sports business attorney and commercial litigator			0
@entity159 , who handles legal matters for the @entity164 's @entity163 ' owner @entity162 and has had dealings with clients involving the @entity4 , said the league might consider allowing @entity0 to sell the team himself by a prescribed deadline			1
estranged : @entity63 , @entity0 's wife , has publicly distanced herself from her husband , and is suing @entity14 but he predicted that , one way or another , @entity28 would end up severed from the @entity1 and would realize that ' the franchise would not be economically viable if he continues to own it			1
' the scandal sparked outrage from fans and players , and numerous commercial sponsors pulled their support from the team before and after the @entity4 moved to expel @entity0			1
@entity0 was banned from any further ties with his team or professional basketball , and stripped of his seat on the @entity4 governing board , days after two websites released audio recordings in which a voice said to be @entity0 's is heard criticizing a female friend for ' associating with black people			1
' @entity66 said tuesday that @entity28 has acknowledged to the @entity4 that the recording was authentic but did not apologize			0
the sale of the @entity1 could take weeks			0
according to @entity4 bylaws , @entity66 must present @entity28 a written copy of any allegations justifying a forced sale within three days , and @entity0 would have five days to answer			2
a special hearing of the @entity199 , consisting of all the owners , would then be held on a date no more than 10 days after @entity0 's reply			2
the prospect of @entity0 's ouster led several luminaries of sports and show business to signal interest in buying the team			2
among them were talk show host turned media mogul @entity212 , @entity214 executive @entity213 , computer technology titan @entity215 , former @entity104 star @entity217 and boxing promoter @entity218 .			0
