congressman @entity1 's ties to his former colleagues in the @entity3 were not as pleasant as he portrayed as a new report reveals that he was banned from the agency 's offices since he left in 2006			1
the @entity7 , who was indicted two weeks ago on 20 counts including tax evasion and fraud , worked as an undercover @entity3 agent for years before running for office but the extent of the scorched earth he left behind was not evident until today			1
@entity17 reports that security guards were given explicit orders to keep @entity1 from entering either of the two @entity21 @entity3 offices after he resigned			1
' he is not welcome , ' a former @entity3 official said , according to @entity17			2
the unidentified former official said that the people - like @entity1 - who were banned from entering the @entity3 buildings ' are all employees who were fired , or they were under circumstances where they were forced out or felt they should leave , and all are no longer welcome back			1
' @entity1 left the agency in 2006 when he was reportedly the subject of an internal review in light of two troubling concerns			0
remember this face : security guards at the @entity21 @entity3 offices were given pictures of @entity1 to remind them to stop him if he ever tried to enter there were allegations that he told a female source that he was working undercover while still working on a case , and there were also questions raised about expenses he had filed			1
after leaving the agency , he went on to work in private businesses and got involved in a health food restaurant called @entity59 , which has come back into the fold since the charges against him stem from allegedly illegal payment practices at the @entity64 restaurant			1
in 2010 , he was elected to @entity65 amid a wave of @entity68 support , but that did n't mean that all was forgiven over at the @entity3			2
' some of us thought it was kind of a joke after he was elected to @entity65 that his picture stayed up , ' the unidentified former @entity3 official said			1
@entity1 , who was caught on camera threatening to throw a reporter off the balcony of the @entity80 building earlier this year , has maintained his innocence in the tax evasion and fraud case and a spokesman denied any knowledge that he had left the @entity3 on bad terms			1
' false rumors and malicious lies relating to the congressman â€™s tenure in the @entity3 have been reported on since 2010 and have been repeatedly refuted , ' the spokesman told @entity17			0
earlier this week , @entity1 's ex-girlfriend @entity92 entered a not guilty plea on the charges she faced for allegedly arranging accounts for fake donors to contribute to his 2010 congressional campaign			0
both she and @entity1 are free on bail as he awaits further hearings in his case			0
' appropriate ' : speaker @entity101 accepted @entity1 's offer to step down from his role on the @entity104 in light of the charges he has maintained his innocence throughout the process and has not announced any plans to resign from his position , but he did step down from his role on the @entity104			0
@entity1 sent @entity101 and majority leader @entity110 a letter removing himself from the committee due to the arrest , but said that he hopes to be reinstated when he is cleared of all charges			0
he is charged with mail fraud , wire fraud and tax fraud , all of which are connected to his involvement with @entity59 when he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010			0
the lengthy indictment charges @entity1 with two different types of fraud - mail and wire - as well as obstruction of justice , perjury , employing illegal immigrants , and conspiracy to defraud the @entity131			0
connected : @entity1 's ex-girlfriend @entity92 ( pictured last week ) has entered a not guilty plea for the charges she faces in connection to his allegedly illegal campaign fundraising he is accused of concealing more than $ 1million in receipts , as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars that were kept away from employees			1
while helping run the @entity140 restaurant , @entity59 , @entity1 is accused of keeping two sets of payroll records			2
the one he turned over to the restaurant 's accountants , who used them as the basis for their tax returns , showed lower payouts to employees than he was actually paying them - as he opted for cash payouts of either half or all of their earnings so that there was no trail			2
the perjury charge , however , comes from a deposition in january 2013 where he allegedly lied under oath			0
the deposition came when former employees accused @entity1 of paying them less than minimum wage .			0

@entity1 was reportedly banned from entering @entity3 offices after he quit working as an undercover agent
the ban continued even after he was elected to @entity65 in 2010
' he is not welcome , ' a former @entity3 official said
@entity1 faces 20 charges related to tax evasion and fraud from when he was an investor in a health food restaurant after leaving the @entity3
