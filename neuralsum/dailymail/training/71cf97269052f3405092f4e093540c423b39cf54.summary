ask a man in his 50s about his ideal woman , and chances are she would be half his age			0
and if a 20 - year - old described his dream date , he ’d probably choose someone a little bit older			2
for , according to a study , no matter how old a man is he always hankers after a woman in her mid- 20s			1
celebrity couple @entity17 , 47 , @entity18 , 27 , show that this can work but , while the odd celebrity may enjoy some success – such as 47 - year - old actor @entity17 , who is dating model @entity18 , 27 – most men ’s daydreams do not match their reality , as their wife or girlfriend is more likely to be close to them in age			2
but women seem to be a little more realistic , as they tend to fancy men their own age or slightly older			2
they are more likely to get their way , too , with most of those surveyed in relationships with men a year or two older			0
@entity36 researchers asked more than 12,500 men and women about the age of their partner and the age of the people they felt most attracted to or fantasised about			0
the magic number for men of all ages was around 24 or 25 , since older men preferred younger women and those in their late teens or early 20s fancied slightly older women			1
the researchers believe evolution has programmed men to desire women in their mid- 20s because they are highly fertile , meaning they have the highest odds of bearing the man ’s child and passing on his genes			1
but women are programmed very differently			0
the study , in the journal @entity61 , found women think men their own age or slightly older are the most attractive			1
the biggest age gap was for women in their late teens and early 20s , who fancied men around four years older			1
researcher @entity69 , of @entity70 in @entity71 , south @entity36 , said a slightly older male is more likely to have the money and stability to bring up a family than a younger man			0
and although a much older ‘ sugar daddy ’ may have more money , he is more likely to die while his family are still young .			0
