@entity9 eventually kills @entity15 but not before he too is fatally wounded			0
the children and grandchildren of @entity20 's two brothers were also said to have been killed			0
in a case of life imitating art , family loyalty and a murderous struggle for power are key themes in @entity37 's well - known play , @entity9 , which was written between 1599 and 1602			1
the play begins with @entity9 , visited by a mysterious ghost who resembles his recently - deceased father , the @entity138			2
