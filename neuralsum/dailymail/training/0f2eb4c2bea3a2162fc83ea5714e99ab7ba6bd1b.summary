if @entity0 do confound what would appear to be growing opinion and lift the @entity3 for the third time on sunday , do not expect to find coach @entity5 in the middle of the post-match party			1
@entity5 , 59 , is not the type to get too close to his players			1
he is a tactician , a coach , rather than a gregarious man of the people			2
more pertinently , by the time the final whistle blows on this tournament , @entity5 will no longer be @entity0 ’s boss , having announced his decision to resign on saturday after a campaign he feels has been hampered by interference from his own @entity18			1
‘ he just wants to coach but with @entity0 it ’s not always that easy			1
there is too much meddling			2
’ @entity5 — a quiet man known to suffer from self - doubt — has certainly cut one of the more peculiar figures of this @entity3			1
so far , his most memorable moments have been one which saw him squirted in the face with water by @entity40 midfielder @entity39 during a break in play against @entity43 and when he almost stumbled backward into his own dugout after seeing @entity45 hit the bar against @entity47			0
both incidents added apparent credence to a popular view that @entity5 is a rather comical figure , a patsy at the head of a squad that is actually controlled and organised by star player @entity55			1
sunday ’s final , however , affords ‘ @entity57 ’ , the former @entity58 and @entity59 midfielder , the opportunity to prove his own credibility once and for all			2
@entity66 , the former @entity67 midfielder who played for @entity68 at @entity69 , said : ‘ if we win this then everybody will have no choice but to become @entity74			0
never mind the score on sunday , @entity5 has done his bit and he will leave an important part of himself in this team			1
’ @entity76 pairing : @entity5 celebrates with @entity55 after his side reach the @entity3 final ready : @entity5 knows he must make a decision with friendlies looming as @entity0 get back to normal the fact that @entity66 found it necessary to speak up for his former coach on saturday says much for @entity5 ’s image issues			1
the notion that @entity55 effectively runs the team is a popular one and the @entity68 ’s doormat image was certainly not helped by his failure to punish @entity39 for embarrassing him on the touchline			0
however , sources close to the @entity0 squad insist that the @entity55 theory does not stack up			1
not only did @entity68 cut one of @entity55 ’s friends , midfielder @entity92 , from his final 23 for @entity94 , he dropped another , @entity96 , after the laboured last - 16 win over @entity98 in @entity99			2
the change of team shape and tactics that followed that unconvincing extra-time victory flew in the face of the attacking formation that @entity55 is supposed to have insisted on			0
but the changes bore the hallmarks of a thinking man ’s coach simply doing his work			0
‘ he transmits quality to the team , ’ @entity66 added			0
‘ he is very concerned with detail , preparing for each match by going over anything that could happen			0
he is really intelligent and has managed to get @entity55 operating to his potential levels after the highs and lows of before			0
‘ but , importantly , that has not come at the group ’s expense			0
’ all smiles : the @entity0 players seemed in high spirits as they trained in @entity125 relaxed : @entity68 's @entity0 take on @entity126 in the 2014 world cup final on sunday night known as ‘ @entity128 ’ during his playing days — a reference to his lack of pace — @entity5 did not become a coach in his own right until 2009 , by which time he was already 54			1
previously , he had served as assistant to former international team - mate @entity136 with @entity0 and then clubs in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity94			1
taking over at @entity69 five years ago , there were doubts over whether his dour public persona would lend itself to the role of figurehead			0
he immediately won the @entity147 ( @entity149 ’s @entity148 ) , following up with the @entity150 a year later			2
@entity69 were also one minute away from winning the @entity151 against @entity152 in 2009 , only to concede an equaliser in the final minute and an extra-time winner to none other than @entity55			0
in @entity155 on sunday , @entity5 can make the ultimate statement , to leave a mark that can never be erased			2
cult figure @entity158 , leader of a haphazard @entity0 campaign in @entity160 four years ago , said just 10 days ago that ‘ things look bleak for @entity0 ’			2
that comment came just after the @entity98 match			0
since then a coach ’s coach has made his mark , whether people wish to believe it or not			0
through : the @entity0 players wheel away in celebration after beating @entity171 in the @entity3 semi-finals			1

@entity0 manager @entity5 would not be in the middle of the post-match party if he won the @entity3 final 2014
59 - year - old announced decision to resign after tournament on saturday
' he has just had enough . he just wants to coach but with @entity0 it 's not always that easy . there is too much meddling , ' source tells @entity187
