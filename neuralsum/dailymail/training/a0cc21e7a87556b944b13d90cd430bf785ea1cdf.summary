by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 02:52 est , 23 november 2012 treating adhd in convicted criminals could have a major impact on reoffending , a study suggests			1
criminal behaviour in people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity2 ) falls by about a third when they are on medication , the research shows			1
translated to the prison population , similar treatment could have a dramatic effect , experts believe			0
treating adhd in convicted criminals could have a major impact on reoffending around four per cent of children in the @entity19 and half as many adults are believed to suffer from the disorder , which is characterised by over-activity , impulsivity , aggression , short temper and disorganised thinking			1
but a disproportionate number of people with @entity2 end up being convicted of petty crimes , often related to violence and drug abuse			0
studies suggest that anything from 10 per cent to 40 per cent of prison inmates have the disorder , but few are diagnosed or treated			1
treating @entity2 - affected children with drugs such as the stimulant @entity40 is controversial because of the side effects , which can include nervous system disturbances and raised blood pressure and heart rate			2
the research was conducted in @entity46 , where it is easy to access data on medical treatments and criminal convictions through national registries			1
scientists studied the records of more than 25,000 individuals with @entity2 , mostly teenagers and young adults			2
they found that over a period of four years , 37 per cent of the men and 15 per cent of the women were convicted of crimes , compared with a rate in the general population of 9 per cent and 2 per cent			2
drug treatment for @entity2 was associated with a 32 per cent drop in offending rates by men and 41 per cent by women - an overall reduction of about a third			2
but the study authors say such drugs could have a real impact on crime , although their use would have to be carefully considered on a case - by - case basis			0
the findings are published in the @entity76			0
professor @entity77 , one of the researchers from the @entity79 in @entity46 , said : ' it 's said that roughly 30 per cent to 40 per cent of long - serving criminals have @entity2			1
' if their chances of recidivism can be reduced by 30 per cent , it would clearly affect total crime numbers in many societies			1
' almost 27 per cent of convicted criminals released from prisons in @entity90 and @entity91 reoffend within a year , according to the latest @entity93 figures			2
besides crime , @entity2 is linked to many problems that can afflict a person 's life , including poor academic performance , unemployment , alcohol and drug abuse , and relationship breakdown			0
however , although the disorder is known to persist into adulthood , treatment invariably stops in adolescence			0
@entity19 expert professor @entity107 , from the @entity108 at @entity109 , said he would expect to see wide - ranging benefits if convicted criminals were regularly treated for adhd			1
' if they were in prison and showing aggressive or difficult behaviour , i 'd hope to see a reduction in those aggressive behaviours , ' he said			0
almost 27 per cent of convicted criminals released from prisons in @entity90 and @entity91 reoffend within a year , according to the latest @entity93 figures ' i 'd also expect to see more engagement with rehabilitation processes			0
' in the long run , in the community , if people remained engaged in treatment you 'd expect to see reduced rates of repeat offending but also better adjustment overall			0
' they 'd be more able to find employment and maintain themselves in employment , and generate better relationship and social structures			0
' we would hope to see maybe half of these people showing significant benefits , but we do need to do the research			1
' he pointed out that drug treatment for adhd cost around £ 100 - £ 300 per patient per month , which was ' vastly outweighed ' by the financial burden of criminal behaviour .			1

around four per cent of children in the @entity19 and half as many adults are believed to suffer from adhd
criminal behaviour in those with the disorder falls by about 30 *%* when they are on medication , research shows
