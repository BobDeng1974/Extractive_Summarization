by @entity1 reporter published : 16:08 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 17:05 est , 8 january 2014 a gene regulating our body clock may stop us piling on the pounds and could be used to create anti obesity drugs , researchers claim			1
researchers found that the ' neuropeptide y system ' ( @entity9 ) , may play a central role in determining how fat we become			1
they compared the @entity9 system in mice with humans and found an important difference			2
radical : a gene which regulates the body clock as well as growth hormone production could be used to combat obesity in humans in humans the neurotransmitter communicates with four well - known ' cell surface receptors ' in the brain ( @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 ) which trigger the system 's effects			1
however mice have an additional receptor , @entity33 , which has a profound effect on their body composition			0
it is produced in the part of the brain that regulates the body clock as well as growth hormone production			0
scientists may have discovered a gene which could control how fat we become researchers deleted the gene in mice to understand its effects on body fat			1
they found that mice without the @entity33 gene were smaller and had less lean tissue than normal mice			2
on the other hand as they aged they became fatter than normal mice especially when on a high - fat diet			0
the mice on a high fat diet actually became obese and developed metabolic problems similar to diabetes			0
although the @entity33 receptors are different in humans , the findings , published in @entity63 , could help researchers develop anti-obesity drugs in the future			0
professor @entity69 , from the @entity70 in @entity71 , said : ' i find it amazing that one gene , which is expressed in the small part of the brain that controls the body clock , has such a profound impact on how much fat is stored on the body , and how much lean tissue is maintained			1
' importantly , we use mice as models of human beings in research , and so when looking for anti-obesity drugs , we need to fully understand the function of the @entity9 system in this animal model to understand how similar circuits in humans connect with the body clock			0

scientists find gene that regulates *biorhythms* also controls fat *levels*
discovery by researchers at @entity70 , @entity71 , may combat obesity
study found mice lost *weight* when gene was turned off
