the @entity23 says more and more people are now signing up to ‘ @entity25 ’ , the @entity22 reports			2
it says 40 per cent more people followed the diet in the first two months of 2013 than in the first two months of 2012			1
people adopt the diet temporarily for a range of reasons , including to shed their excess @entity33 pounds and to detox			1
@entity35 , director of the vegan and vegetarian group @entity36 , says most people do it either because of health concerns or because they have developed greater awareness of animal rights			1
she told the @entity22 : ‘ people might be prone to heart disease or want to get their cholesterol down			2
‘ or it might be because they 've seen something on factory farming			0
but once people turn to veganism , they usually open their minds to the other issue too			2
‘ the third factor , which is more unusual , is environmental reasons such as global warning or deforestation			0
’ the @entity23 estimates that about 150,000 people in the @entity60 are vegan			2
this means they do n't eat anything that comes from an animal : fish , meat or anything containing animal fats			0
they also avoid dairy products such as cows ’ milk , cheese and yoghurt and also eggs or products containing eggs			0
one person to go vegan for a month is @entity80 , a marketing director from @entity81			0
