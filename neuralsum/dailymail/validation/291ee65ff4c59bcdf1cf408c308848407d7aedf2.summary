@entity0 has branded @entity2 ’s @entity1 a diver - then called on the @entity4 to prove they do n’t just punish @entity7 players for simulation			1
@entity1 tumbled to win @entity2 ’s goal from the penalty spot - scored by @entity11 - towards the end of the first half after ref @entity14 deemed he had been tripped by @entity15			1
in august , @entity7 winger @entity16 was handed a two - match ban for diving to win a penalty in a 2 - 0 win at @entity21			1
and @entity0 insisted he was baffled as to why it ’s only his team that is targeted – albeit he was seemingly unaware @entity21 ’s @entity23 was also suspended for diving to win a penalty against @entity25 in december			1
@entity7 manager @entity0 wants retrospective action after claiming @entity1 dived to win a penalty the referee points to the spot after @entity1 was brought down in the @entity7 box during @entity32 clash @entity7 keeper @entity33 fails to stop @entity11 from giving @entity2 the lead at @entity35 ‘ the @entity2 penalty was a dive and hopefully it will be the same rules for everybody , ’ fumed @entity0			1
‘ we are the only team this season in the league to have a suspension for diving , @entity16			1
‘ i said at the time it was no problem because that is the line that will be taken by everyone			2
but i do n’t think anybody has had it since then			2
the @entity52 players have been unbelievably good			2
they ’ve not dived but if they do ( like @entity1 ) it should be the same rules			1
‘ is it the fault of the ref or the player they got a penalty ? it ’s both			2
but i accept people make mistakes			2
we have a rule where people look at things afterwards but i do n’t see anybody else getting suspensions			2
’ @entity7 defender @entity68 ( right ) was sent off after only nine minutes of the @entity32 quarter - final in what appeared to be a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off @entity2 's @entity74 @entity2 had a second player sent off after @entity76 ( 3rd left ) receives his marching orders @entity0 will study footage of the melee that saw @entity81 ordered off alongside @entity74 before deciding whether to appeal in a bid to clear him for sunday ’s @entity85 final against @entity2 at @entity86			1
but @entity87 will miss the @entity32 quarter - final replay at @entity89 on march 18 after being booked yesterday			1
‘ i have looked at some pictures but it ’s hard to see what happened , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity81 just said there was a tackle and suddenly somebody was holding his legs			0
there was some kicking of each other to get off each other			0
' hopefully everybody can play in the next game			0
will we appeal ? we will see			0
i actually did n’t know until now that @entity87 is out of the replay			0
it ’s good we have a big squad			0
’ @entity110 missed his chance to equalise for @entity7 from the penalty spot @entity110 made up for his penalty miss by drawing @entity7 level with a header @entity7 captain @entity116 celebrates with @entity110 as the game finishes in a 1 - 1 draw @entity0 did n’t fear any further disciplinary problems in the final but took a swipe at the abysmal @entity35 pitch			1
‘ there is going to be a high temperature , yes , but i ’m not worried			0
that ’s why we love football			0
we are fighting for big things , trophies , and we have to keep our discipline			0
but the pitch made it a fight today			0
it was nothing about playing football			0
if you are going to develop players in this league , you have to have pitches you can play on			0
’ meanwhile , the @entity4 compliance officer could be forced to look at footage from @entity143 tv in which @entity7 ’s @entity144 is alleged to have performed a song during an interview including the words ‘ the huns are deid ’			1
a recent petition lobbying the @entity150 was launched by a group of @entity153 fans who claimed ‘ huns ’ is a derogatory term used against @entity156 .			0

@entity32 quarter - final ended in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity35
referee sent off @entity7 defender @entity68 and @entity2 's @entity74 ( in a case of mistaken identity ) and @entity76
@entity0 has *accused* @entity1 from diving to win a penalty
@entity11 opened the scoring for the hosts from the penalty spot
@entity110 missed a penalty before equalising for the @entity174
