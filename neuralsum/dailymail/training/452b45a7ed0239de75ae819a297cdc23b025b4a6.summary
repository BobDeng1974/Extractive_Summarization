as revealed by @entity1 's @entity0 , @entity2 and @entity3 have been reported to the @entity4 and accused of being racist , sexist and homophobic in a shocking series of text messages dating back to their time together at @entity8			1
here , we take a look at the three main players in the saga			0
@entity13 as a graduate in @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity3 initially found work as a translator for the @entity20 side during @entity21 , before taking a staff writer ’s position at @entity24			1
in 2001 , he made the move to @entity27 , a @entity28 - based sports management franchise , then leaving to become @entity30 ’s press officer four years later			1
shock : @entity3 , @entity33 's director of football ( left ) , and @entity2 ( right ) are being investigated it was at @entity35 that @entity3 first linked up with @entity2 , forming a close professional relationship that saw him soon promoted to football operations manager			1
when @entity2 left for @entity8 in 2011 , @entity3 followed , this time as head of recruitment			1
@entity8 reached the @entity41 final in 2012 and were promoted to the @entity42 a year later , but amid a protracted bust - up between @entity2 and the club ’s controversial owner , @entity44 , @entity3 was dismissed in october 2013			1
resigned : @entity3 ( centre with chairman @entity48 right ) was @entity33 's sporting director he was replaced by 23 - year - old @entity49 , who was at the club on work experience and a friend of @entity44 ’s son			1
@entity33 were quick to appoint @entity3 as their sporting director , with a remit to improve their club infrastructure and to address weaknesses in player recruitment			1
@entity2 a powerful centre - back with @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity30 — winning five @entity67 caps — he began his managerial career at @entity69 club @entity30 in 2009 , after @entity70 resigned			1
he spent two years at @entity35 , safeguarding them from relegation , before moving to @entity8 in 2011			2
in his first season in charge of the @entity76 club , @entity2 , 42 , guided them to their first ever @entity41 final , which they lost to @entity79 on penalties and finished sixth in the @entity69 , though they missed out on promotion through the play - offs			2
reported : @entity2 is being investigated by the @entity4 due to racist , sexist and homophobic text messages still , 2012 ’s heartache proved to be short - lived , as @entity8 were promoted to the @entity42 as champions the following year			1
despite his successes , however , @entity2 ’s relationship with club owner @entity44 became increasingly strained			2
the @entity90 businessman was reportedly dissatisfied with @entity2 ’s transfer dealings			2
@entity2 was dismissed as @entity8 manager in december 2013			1
@entity44 the bank clerk who became an insurance salesman			0
the insurance salesman who bought a @entity97 ’s chain			0
the @entity97 ’s store owner who built an empire			0
the story of @entity44 , 62 , is fittingly colourful			0
he bought a @entity97 ’s franchise in 1980 , using the money from rapid expansion to purchase @entity104 in 1985 , a gambling company			0
unprecedented success on both fronts allowed him to venture into several more industries , most notably founding the @entity109 , which runs the gamut over @entity90 property development and holidays			0
in addition , he owns two football clubs , @entity8 , relegated last season , and @entity116 in @entity117			2
better times : @entity8 owner @entity44 ( left ) with his then manager @entity2 the @entity119 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity2 ’s time at @entity8			1
in the course of a search by the @entity129 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity2 ’s employment at @entity8 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity137 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity137 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			0
that said , @entity137 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity4 process is complete			2
the @entity119 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity137 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			0
if @entity137 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity137 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity4 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity33			1
@entity137 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			0
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity137 ’s involvement in this matter			0
@entity137 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			2
@entity137 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity137 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity4 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter			2
