solitary : @entity0 has worked as the winter caretaker of @entity2 since 1973 @entity0 has lived in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , but the place he decided to settle down is about the opposite of any booming metropolis			1
for the past 42 years , @entity0 has worked as the caretaker of @entity2 , protecting the park 's buildings during the long and brutal winter months			1
he lives in a small cabin alone during the winter , with enough food stored up since his closest neighbors are a two - hour snowmobile ride away			1
it sounds like the premise of @entity20 's thriller @entity21 , but @entity0 claims he 's never felt lonely or the least bit antsy cooped up alone in his cabin			2
' never had cabin fever			0
never been bored , ' the 70 - something outdoorsman told @entity26			0
that 's because there 's plenty of work to keep @entity0 busy			2
winter preparation starts in november , when he works with a crew to board up his share of the parks about 100 buildings			1
then , once everyone is gone , he waits for the snow to come - and it never disappoints			2
@entity2 averages about 150 inches of snowfall a year and @entity0 has to stop it from accumulating on the roofs of the park 's buildings , which can collapse under the weight of the snow			1
over the years , @entity0 has developed a system which takes some of the hassle out of shoveling the roofs			2
instead , he uses a saw to cut the snow into blocks which he then pushes off the roof with the help of gravity			0
@entity0 has been doing the job since 1973 , when he was the only applicant and the pay was just $ 13.24 a day			1
over the years , @entity0 's responsibilities have grown and now he is one of the only @entity2 staffers who work at the park year round			1
but he says he never gets lonely tough work : during the day , @entity0 works to keep about 100 buildings free from snow , since they can collapse under the several feet that accumulate every year			1
he has developed a method of sawing the snow into blocks and pushing them off the roof , which makes the job a little easier the cold months : the winter care - taking job starts at the beginning of november and ends whenever plows can reach the park			1
above a group of bison seen in a snow - covered @entity2 field @entity84 home : this small 100 - year - old cabin is where @entity0 calls home			1
he packs it with just enough food to last the winter while most caretakers only last a few years in the job , @entity0 continues because he 's comfortable with the solitude and has the right interests to make the job fun			1
amazingly , @entity0 has no tv in his small cabin , which he estimates is about 100 years old			1
instead , he gets his news by tuning into @entity98 and entertains himself with his vast library of books			0
he also spends a lot of time outside cross-country skiing and taking pictures of the winter landscape			1
many of his pictures of the frozen - over park have been featured in @entity109			2
' i 've seen many wonderful things here , ' he said			0
' occasionally get a picture of them			0
but a lot of the great pictures are in my head , you know , that you could n't quite pull it off with a camera			0
' in 1978 , he illustrated his own story for the magazine about raising his two daughters at the park			0
@entity127 reader : @entity0 has no tv			2
instead , he reads for entertainment and has a vast library technology : @entity0 is able to connect to the outside world with a computer			2
he gets his news from listening to the radio far from civilization : @entity0 's closest neighbors are about a two - hour snowmobile ride away during the winter , he and ex-wife @entity139 home - schooled the two girls , which they were suited to with his bachelor 's degree in history and her master 's in education			1
his daughters are grown now and @entity0 has since broken up with his wife , but they made plenty of memories during their winters together in @entity2			1
in 1973 , a female grizzly bear broke a window into their kitchen while @entity139 was cooking a pot of stew for dinner			0
the sow reached in and grabbed the pot and luckily took off with the meal instead of sticking around			0
' the next morning i found the pot behind the house , licked shiny clean , ' @entity0 said in his @entity109 piece			0
beautiful scenery : @entity0 is also a gifted photographer , and many of his pictures of the snowy @entity2 landscape have been featured in @entity109 all to himself : above , @entity0 is seen walking near the park 's legendary geysers , which three million people flock to see every year he had iron bars installed on the windows to protect from any future run - ins with the local wildlife			1
@entity0 says there 's no set schedule in place for when the care - taking season ends			1
it 's over when the plows can reach him			0
' this job has never been by the calendar or by the clock , ' @entity0 said			2
' you work with the winter			0
' in the warmer months , @entity0 gets some much - needed sun and travels to @entity191 where he spends every april on safari			2
before be became caretaker at @entity2 , @entity0 spent three years living in @entity195 and @entity196 teaching and it was during that time that he first became interested in the quieter life			1
' it changed my life , ' he said of his time in the @entity191 bush , ' and that 's what brought me here			0
' with his older age , @entity0 says he 's considered retirement , but does n't seem to have taken the prospect too seriously			0
' i think of it			0
they say a lot of people die when they retire , you know ? ' he said			0
however , he does think his way of life may be coming to an end , as transportation in and out the park during the winter months gets easier .			0
