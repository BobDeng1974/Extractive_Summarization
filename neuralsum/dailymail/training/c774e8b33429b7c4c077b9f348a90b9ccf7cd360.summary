this year was bizarrely bookended for @entity0 , opening with a 6 - 0 , 6 - 0 thrashing of a @entity3 no - hoper and ending with a crushing 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 loss at the hands of @entity6			1
detached analysis shows that , in between times , he actually performed pretty well to finish it ranked no 6 , considering the turbulence that continually buffeted him			2
aside from having to recover from back surgery , there was the loss of the two key coaches in his career , @entity19 and @entity20 , replaced by the groundreaking appointment of @entity22			1
for good measure he also lost his main clothing sponsor , threw in the odd politically - contentious tweet and got engaged to long - term girlfriend @entity27			0
@entity0 trains in the gym in @entity29 as he shapes up for the start of the 2015 season @entity0 posted this picture on @entity33 as he hit with @entity35 no 2 @entity34 at the @entity36 in @entity29 @entity0 and coach @entity22 during a training session in @entity38 earlier in december none of which gives much clue as to what will happen when this season begins , unofficially on wednesday , with a low - key exhibition in @entity45 where he is slated to play @entity48 ’s @entity47			1
after that , he represents gb with @entity50 at the @entity51 in @entity52 , and then it is straight into the @entity54 , an event where he has an admirably consistent record			0
yet the truth is that even the most seasoned @entity0 watcher would struggle to muster much conviction in predicting how he will fare this season			1
much of the debate centres on whether @entity22 can instil a more aggressive intent in him , but more fundamental is whether he can rediscover the self - control that became so evident under @entity19			1
the amount of yapping at his support box is usually a pretty good guide to his mindset			0
if we see this spilling over from 2014 , and @entity22 tolerates it as she has done while their relationship beds in , then he is unlikely to regain the place in the top three that his talent should permit			1
@entity22 watches on as @entity0 practices his serve ahead of the new season @entity0 started working with @entity82 @entity22 ahead of @entity83 in june 2014 they will be under scrutiny , as many in the game question the wisdom of the arrangement			1
one @entity91 champion recently described the decision to hire her as ‘ unfathomable ’ , but was fearful of being accused of sexism if his name was put to that			0
@entity0 is not the only big name with questions to answer in 2015			2
@entity6 played 85 matches this year , plenty even for such a phenomenal athlete at 33 , and his continuing outstanding form will depend much on whether his sometimes troublesome back can take the workload			0
@entity105 ’s last @entity104 was @entity83 , and his three comeback tournaments in the autumn yielded just four wins and three defeats			0
the concerns over his long - term fitness will endure , but he has confounded doubters before			0
@entity0 split from coaches @entity19 ( right ) and @entity114 ( left ) in 2014 the partnership has been called into question by many in the game the man sitting prettiest at the start of the year is , by far , @entity120			1
he starts the year 1,585 points ahead of @entity6 at the top of the rankings and the biggest single issue in the men ’s game is whether he can topple @entity105 at @entity127 to complete his @entity104 collection			2
you would expect @entity120 to win at least two @entity104 this year and nudge himself further into the greatest - of - all - time debate			0
i do not see the landscape at the top of the men ’s game changing dramatically this year , but it could be the final season when the now - familiar order remains in place			2
likewise it is difficult to see anyone displacing @entity139 at the top of the @entity141 for now			0
@entity142 could be the one , if she can apply herself more consistently			0
@entity0 and @entity22 have been in talks with @entity144 ( left ) about joining the coaching team from a @entity35 perspective there will be longing for @entity148 to come back fully restored after what will be more than a year out of the game			1
she will not play in @entity151 but , if her cautious recovery from wrist surgery remains on track , the likelihood is her return to the top level will be around the time of the premier events at @entity160 and @entity38 in march			2
that could be a significant month for the @entity35 game , as it is when @entity164 hosts the biggest @entity165 tie the country has seen for decades , the @entity168 first round against the @entity169			1
this might also be the year when , belatedly , tennis takes steps to update its product to suit the modern audience , with its shrunken attention span and desire for fast and furious action			0
men ’s tennis remains — for now — in a golden era and the women ’s game is on an upward curve , but nobody can afford to stand still .			2

@entity0 split from previous coach @entity19 in march , 2014
@entity35 no 1 started working with @entity22 in june
the partnership has been called into question by many in the game
