by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 6 january 2013 updated : 19:03 est , 6 january 2013 working parents are to be given thousands of pounds a year toward the cost of childcare			1
radical proposals at the heart of a new @entity7 deal to be unveiled today will see generous tax breaks being offered to families with children under five who need to pay for nurseries and childminders			1
@entity14 has some of the highest childcare costs in the world , meaning the typical mother with one child and a full - time job needs to work for up to four months of the year just to break even			1
millions with two or more children conclude it is not worth working at all			2
childcare costs : a mother - of - one with a full - time job needs to work for four months of the year to break even @entity26 and @entity27 will mark the halfway point in their government by making reform of childcare a key priority for the next two and a half years			2
ministers are to meet later this week to finalise a deal expected to be worth up to £ 2,000 per year per child for all working parents			1
the prime minister and his @entity39 deputy will insist the coalition is ' steadfast and united ' – and risk alarming party grassroots by hinting at a fresh deal between the @entity43 and @entity39 after the next election by claiming their sense of ' shared purpose ' has ' if anything grown over time '			2
as well as childcare , the @entity7 's ' mid-term review ' will commit to : a cap of around £ 75,000 on elderly care costs ; a more generous flat - rate state pension , to be worth around £ 155 a week after 2015 ; planning reforms to encourage housebuilding and more state mortgage guarantees to help first - time buyers ; a new ' freedom bill ' to limit the reach of the state , including reining in criminal record checks for volunteers ; allowing private companies to build and run new toll motorways and trunk roads			1
mr @entity26 and mr @entity27 , making a rare joint appearance in @entity67 , will list deficit reduction , welfare reform , tougher school standards , council tax freezes , protecting the @entity72 , help with energy bills , fuel duty cuts and increases in the personal income tax allowance as among the government 's achievements			0
' united ' : the prime minister and deputy prime minister will mark the halfway point in their government in a nod to @entity87 's lead in the opinion polls , they will claim they have ' consistently chosen to do what is right over what is easy or popular ; what is in our country 's long - term interest over our parties ' short - term interest '			0
aides said many of the measures will be legislated on in this @entity101 , but will only be implemented after 2015			0
mr @entity26 suggested yesterday he wants to serve as prime minister until at least 2020 to see them through			0
' we will support working families with their childcare costs			2
we will build more houses and make the dream of home ownership a reality for more people , ' mr @entity26 and mr @entity27 write in a foreword to the new @entity7 deal			1
one suggestion in @entity115 is for a third of the cost of childcare to be made tax deductible			0
but senior sources suggested a simpler , flat - rate voucher system was more likely to be announced when final details are made public next week			1
this is seen as a fairer option , since it would be worth the same for every family regardless of income			0
changes : the @entity7 will commit to capping elderly care costs and a more generous flat - rate pension one source said the scheme would be implemented before the next election , since it is seen as a key vote winner			1
the favoured model would more than make up for the loss of child benefit for better - off families that comes into effect today – but only for those where both parents work			1
it is not clear how the cost of the scheme will be met , though scrapping existing workplace childcare vouchers that give some parents a monthly sum tax - free will go some of the way			2
red tape deemed unnecessary – such as adult to child ratios required by organisations offering childcare – will be scrapped			0
banks were last night given four more years and greater flexibility to build up cash reserves to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis			0
global regulators watered down a draft plan and gave banks until 2019 to comply with rules making them hold enough liquid assets to avoid taxpayers having to bail them out			0
they also said a broader range of assets would be considered eligible – including high quality mortgage - backed bonds – under the new system .			0
