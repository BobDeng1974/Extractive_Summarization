by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 will remain as @entity4 captain with @entity5 in line for his test debut after being picked in a 13 - man squad for the third match of the @entity11 series against @entity12 in @entity13			1
@entity4 included wicketkeeper @entity5 , in place of the injured @entity15 , when they named their squad on tuesday afternoon			1
the announcement also confirmed @entity4 's intention to stick with captain cook , who has been badly out of form and has led his team to seven defeats in their last nine tests			0
still there : @entity2 has retained the @entity4 captaincy despite a horrible run of form grabbing his chance : @entity5 has come into the @entity4 squad as a replacement for @entity15 video i will not walk away - @entity2 it 's in his hands : @entity5 is in possession of the gloves for @entity4 @entity2 's role has been called into question by many observers , who cite not just @entity4 's miserable sequence of results - extended when they went 1 - 0 down to @entity12 with a 95 - run defeat at @entity42 on monday - but also the captain 's loss of all form with the bat at the top of the order			1
@entity2 , @entity4 's most prolific centurion , has not made a test hundred in 27 innings and has mustered only 129 runs in nine innings this year			2
@entity5 's promotion , after 69 limited - overs caps , was the obvious response to @entity15 's decision after the second test to rule himself out of @entity59 for the remainder of the summer - during which he is likely to have surgery on his achilles			0
national selector @entity63 congratulated 23 - year - old @entity5 on his inclusion , and called for an improvement from @entity4 to battle back in the five - match series at the @entity67 on sunday			1
" the result of the second @entity69 at @entity42 was very disappointing , " he said			2
" one or two of our players had encouraging performances			0
" however , it is vital the squad learns quickly and arrives in @entity13 this week refreshed and ready to perform well in what will no doubt be another tough test match			0
" frontline seamers @entity78 and @entity80 both came in for criticism after they were unable to bowl @entity12 out cheaply in their first innings , after @entity2 won the toss on a green pitch			2
friendly rivalry : prior ( left ) and @entity5 before the first test at @entity88 for the third test against @entity12 at the @entity67 starting on sunday : a @entity2 ( @entity90 , capt ) , @entity91 ( @entity92 ) , @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , @entity95 ( @entity96 ) , i @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , @entity102 ( @entity94 ) , @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , @entity105 ( @entity96 ) , @entity106 ( @entity107 ) , @entity108 ( @entity96 ) , @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , @entity111 ( @entity99 ) but @entity4 , broadly , have kept faith with familiar players - leaving out only the unavailable @entity115 and uncapped specialist spinner @entity114 from the 14 - man squad selected at @entity42			1
@entity63 added : ' congratulations to @entity5 , who comes into the squad following some very exciting limited - overs performances for @entity4 and a good record with @entity94 this season and fully deserves this opportunity			1
' @entity15 has contributed a huge amount to the @entity4 side over the years and should be proud of his record throughout his 79 tests			0
' he has decided to take time out of the game to work on his fitness , and we will continue to follow his progress over the coming months			0
' big hitter : @entity5 , in action for @entity94 , is an explosive lower middle order batsman			0

@entity4 make one change for third @entity69 at the @entity67
prior *absent* injured so @entity5 takes his place
under - fire @entity2 retains captaincy despite *terrible* run of form
hosts are 1 - 0 down to @entity12 after defeat at @entity42
