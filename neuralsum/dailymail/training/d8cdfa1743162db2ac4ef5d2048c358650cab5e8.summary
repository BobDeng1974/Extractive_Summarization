@entity0 concedes he will be taking @entity1 to face a @entity3 side starting to fire on all cylinders - but insists his players will not simply roll over			1
the @entity1 face reigning @entity6 champions @entity3 at the @entity7 in saturday 's early kick - off looking for their first win in almost a month - with the @entity10 just one point clear of the relegation zone			1
that last victory came over @entity14 , who ran @entity3 close in the title race last season , and @entity0 wants his players to show what they are made of and upset the odds			1
@entity0 says his side will not shy away when they visit @entity3 @entity21 is one of the top two players in the @entity6 , according to @entity23 @entity25 's side are without a number of key individuals - with captain @entity28 and top goalscorer @entity21 amongst a clutch of players ruled out through injury but , despite their fitness worries , @entity0 knows his side have to be at their best to spring a shock			1
' they are just hitting their form , ' he said			0
' it is always difficult to go to the @entity37 , they play some wonderful football but we have been playing well so we do not go there with any fear , but we realise we have got to be on top of our game to come away with anything			2
' we know our goalkeeper and our back four have got to play well and we have got to create chances			0
' ( @entity21 ) @entity21 is as good as anything , him and ( @entity51 striker ) @entity52 are probably the best two in the @entity6			2
but if they wanted to give me @entity55 and @entity56 i would take them tomorrow			0
@entity0 is also a big fan of @entity51 forward @entity52 @entity58 will miss the trip to the @entity7 owing to injury ' i think they are as good as anybody in the country , those two , the difference between the top clubs and everyone at the bottom end is that every player in the 25 is a top international player who can play in several positions			1
' we have got to know what we are doing and be on top of our game - we have done that well recently but we step it up another gear now			0
we did well at @entity76 and @entity77 but now this is another challenge			0
' we are going to the most difficult place , along with @entity80 , so it is a good challenge for us			0
' @entity1 also have some concerning knocks , with @entity58 definitely ruled out of the fixture , and @entity0 has long - said that he is waiting for the january transfer window .			2
