a team of experts is hoping to enter the record books by building the world 's fastest bike powered by hand			1
engineers developed the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) and will attempt to beat the women 's arm - powered speed record in @entity10 later this year			1
it will be piloted and powered by paracyclist @entity11 and will need to travel in excess of 21.39 miles per hour ( 34.42 km / h ) over 656ft ( 200 - metres ) to beat the record			1
engineers have developed a @entity7 ( @entity14 ) ( pictured ) and will attempt to beat the women 's arm - powered speed record in @entity10 in september			1
it will be powered by paracyclist @entity11 and will need to travel in excess of 21.39 miles per hour ( 34.42 km / h ) over a 656ft ( 200 - metre ) stretch of tarmac the current benchmark is held by @entity20 who broke the record on 13 may 1995 on a bike called @entity23			1
ms @entity11 's hpv was been designed by mechanical and composites engineers and students from @entity26 led by @entity27 , lecturer in @entity28 and @entity29 , working with students @entity30 and @entity32			1
mr @entity27 told @entity33 that the team has had to design the whole thing from scratch			0
' the standard design for a bike is n't the best in terms of aerodynamics , ' he said			2
' on our bike we 've put two wheels at the front and one at the back to make it more aerodynamic but this presents an interesting challenge because we need to steer the front wheels and drive at the rear wheels			0
' the @entity52 , previously known as @entity53 , is an electric bike with a chainless drivetrain			0
a built - in electric motor allows users to commute up to 15.6mph ( 25km/h ) in three modes - full electric , full manual and assisted pedalling			0
it has a range of 20 miles ( 32km ) on a single charge in assisted - pedalling mode and takes two hours to recharge			0
the £ 1,499 ( $ 2,270 ) bike ’s accompanying @entity52 app comes with with an intelligent dashboard that allows them to travel around the city in safe hands			0
customers can reserve the @entity52 bike online			0
this means ms @entity11 's body faces forwards , looking towards the floor , with her legs tucked underneath her body			2
' the motion from the rider therefore has to pass through a chain and then to the drive at the back , ' continued mr @entity27			0
the frame of the handcycle is made from aluminium with the help of @entity26 technicians @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 and the team are now building the aerodynamic shell from an advanced composite material			1
elsewhere , mr @entity27 said that because ms @entity11 has limited use of her legs the steering system instead is controlled by her head			2
pads either side of her helmet are used to control the front wheels and move the bike in different directions			0
detailed tests were held over two days earlier this month , one day in the lab and one day in the field with ms @entity11			2
but , instead of working on speed , these tests were designed to test the mechanics			0

motion travels through a chain to a drive at the rear university technicians @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 and the team are now building the aerodynamic shell from an advanced composite material ( illustrated ) they were also carried out to help ms @entity11 master the head - mounted controls			1
ms @entity11 , who last year ranked in the world 's top eight in her sport , said : ' i had first tried out a prototype in october but i was really surprised to see how compact and well engineered the new bike is			1
' it was great to get out and test the current model , but there is a lot for me to get used to in terms of the steering and brakes , the riding position and the weight i have to propel			0
' i am now going to concentrate on my @entity145 events in june and july , but am looking forward to getting back on the track well ahead of the record attempt in september			0
' handcycling is growing in popularity and annual speed trials for a range of @entity152 are held on the long straight roads of @entity154 , @entity10 , where competitors can build up speed over a five - mile ( 8km ) run - up before being measured over a 656ft ( 200 metre ) stretch			1

the current record is held by @entity20 who broke the record on 13 may 1995 on a bike called @entity182 mr @entity27 said : ' after months of planning , design and building it was great to be able to welcome @entity11 to @entity26 and to embark on the first real tests with her at the controls			1
' the tests have provided us with a lot more information , and we are now fully analysing the results , while @entity11 's comments on the day are also hugely important			2
' we will be factoring all of them into our work over the coming months to ensure that we have the best possible opportunity to break the record in september			2

engineers from @entity26 have developed a @entity7 ( @entity14 )
they hope it will break the women 's arm - powered record in @entity10
bike is made of *lightweight* aluminium and is steered using the rider 's head
piloted and powered by paracyclist @entity11 , it needs to exceed 21.39mph ( 34.42 km / h ) over 656ft ( 200 - metres ) to beat the record
