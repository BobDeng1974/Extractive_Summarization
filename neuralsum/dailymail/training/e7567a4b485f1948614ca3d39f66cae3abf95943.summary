by @entity1 reporter published : 06:16 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 08:51 est , 14 may 2012 mystery still surrounds the 2008 ' kidnapping ' of a pilot who was subjected to an unclaimed $ 750,000 ransom bid and whose body has never been found			1
more than four years on , the whereabouts of 26 - year - old @entity8 is still unknown , despite a workmate recently being found guilty of his manslaughter			1
his parents , @entity12 and @entity13 , this week revealed for the first time the inside story about their heartbreaking ordeal in a special @entity2 broadcast on @entity16			1
scroll down to see video ... missing : @entity8 vanished in 2008 and has never been found @entity18 demand : this is the email sent to @entity21 demanding $ 750,000 for the release of his son @entity23 they told how they received an anonymous note , signed ' @entity27 ' , demanding three quarters of a million dollars on april 3 - two days after @entity23 vanished			1
convicted : @entity29 , who was sentenced for the manslaughter of @entity8 they stumped up the cash and tried to drop it off to the supposed abductor , but no - one came to claim it			1
@entity23 , business development manager and pilot at the @entity38 , @entity39 , branch of @entity12 's aircraft maintenance firm @entity42 , was never heard from again			1
no further demands were made on the ransom , and his body was never found			1
speaking of the moment they received the note , @entity12 said : ' i ca n't imagine anything worse			1
somebody has taken one of your children , and is threatening to kill him			1
' when i opened the email , it scared the hell out of me			2
i found the ransom demand from the people who had taken @entity23			2
' the note said : ' we have @entity23 , if you hope to see him alive again , you must follow our instructions without deviation ! do not speak about this to anyone , including family			2
' there was a five - day deadline of april 8 , and so , after drafting in the @entity70 , @entity12 , who lived in @entity72 , @entity73 , set off to @entity39			1
hope : @entity8 ' family offered a $ 250,000 for any information leading to the discovery of the missing man he wired the money to a @entity39 bank with the idea that he would use it as bait to entice the abductor			1
but officers rejected that plan and filled it with coffee that weighed the same amount as the cash			2
they placed the box , as demanded , in @entity23 's office			2
a secret camera was set up to record what happened , and armed @entity94 teams hid close by			2
but no - one ever came to collect the loot			2
it was during this time the @entity70 turned its attention to @entity12 , who had separated from @entity13 some years earlier and had just reached a deal where she would receive $ 750,000			1
@entity70 special agent @entity99 told @entity2 this information led him to believe that the author of the ransom note was ' very close to this business '			2
desperate : @entity105 ' parents , @entity12 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) this week revealed for the first time the inside story about their heartbreaking ordeal in a special @entity2 broadcast on @entity16 @entity12 said he felt , during that time , like a suspect			2
he said : ' they treated me like one			2
i was grilled a number of times			2
you know , ' how could you possibly be looking at me ? ' @entity13 was also under the spotlight , as was former colleague mechanic @entity117 who had been sacked because of a drink problem			0
no - one could understand how @entity23 , a star athlete in great physical condition who was a keen boater and fisherman and had spent years in military academies , could have vanished so suddenly			1
@entity12 and @entity13 , becoming increasingly desperate , offered a $ 250,000 reward on national television and followed up on tips from psychics who claimed to know the location of their son			0
then came the bombshell , from his barber @entity130 , that @entity8 could still be alive			1
she said he once told her ' he was frustrated with his life '			0
puzzle : no - one could understand how @entity23 , a star athlete in great physical condition who was a keen boater and fisherman and had spent years in military academies , could have vanished so suddenly she said @entity23 had learned his father carried a kidnapping insurance policy and ended their conversation by saying : ' please do n't tell anybody i told you all this '			1
but family members say @entity23 would never be that selfish and the investigation took another turn as officers spoke to @entity148 , the the owner of another airplane engine repair business			0
the pair had been together the day before his disappearance and had come up with a plan to partner their firms with @entity117 to play a key role			0
everything was in place but @entity12 , who had previously sacked @entity117 , vetoed the proposals			0
@entity117 went on the run			0
in desperation , @entity70 agents obtained detailed call records of the location of @entity23 's mobile phone calls and , in turn , @entity167 footage of the various toll booths on the @entity169 where a call was made from			0
@entity12 was drafted in to look at the tapes and quickly spotted the car of @entity29 , his 42 - year - old operations manager , who passed through the toll booth with his right arm and hand close to his ear			1
but , according to @entity29 's own phone records , his mobile was not in use as he went through the toll			1
he then became a prime suspect , was called in for questioning and could not provide an alibi for his whereabouts that evening			0
the @entity70 discovered he had several mistresses , outside his marriage to wife @entity187			0
but there was no dna , blood or forensic proof to link him to the crime			0
the trail had gone cold			0
then , in march 2009 , the @entity70 called in reinforcements to ' systematically ' go back over the case			0
they soon realised that ' @entity29 's phone and @entity8 ' phones were seemingly synchronised ' meaning that , in the tollbooth photograph , @entity29 was using @entity8 ' phone			1
@entity99 said : ' when you put them together - the pieces of the puzzle - it 's - it 's a very strong circumstantial case			0
' @entity29 was arrested on december 18 , 2009 , at @entity205 after a flight from @entity207 , @entity208			1
@entity29 , whose real first name is @entity210 , denied the charges of extortion , kidnapping and murder of @entity8 and languished in a @entity39 jail for two years			1
then , in january 2012 , he stood trial			0
defence lawyers said there was no evidence and pointed the finger at @entity117 , who in fact died of lung cancer in 2009			0
but prosecutors said that ' too many coincidences is not a coincidence ' and that @entity29 's unexplained whereabouts for over four hours the night @entity23 disappeared was key			1
they also said @entity29 repeatedly used @entity8 ' phone , even using it to send the ransom demand to his father			1
@entity29 was found guilty of manslaughter and is currently scheduled for release in 2039 when he will be 72 - years - old			1
he is appealing his conviction based on insufficient evidence			0
@entity21 told the court following the verdict : ' keep this man off the street , and maybe someway , somehow , somewhere he 'll decide to tell us where , what he did - what he did with @entity23			0
' we have a son			0
we do n't know where he is			0
we wan na bring him home			0
i wan na know where my son is			0
' @entity13 added : ' i 'd give anything for - to hear him again			0
just to touch him again			0
