by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 12:27 est , 20 january 2014 @entity2 , who until recently was president @entity4 's @entity3 culture minister a leading @entity6 politician described @entity7 as a ‘ suburb of @entity9 ’ today as the two cities continued a war of words over which is the most popular in the world			1
@entity2 , who until recently was president @entity4 ’s @entity3 culture minister before running for mayor of the @entity6 capital , said there was more crime in the @entity21 capital , less entrepreneurial businesses starting up , and fewer foreign visitors			1
but she did concede that there was more dog waste on @entity9 pavements , and that notoriously rude @entity27 ' should be kinder '			0
@entity29 - based tourist agency @entity28 claimed @entity7 broke the 16 - million visitor bar last year , with @entity9 attracting 15.9 million people			1
but in an angry riposte , @entity9 city hall put out a statement today saying the figures were utterly misleading			0
‘ so at this stage @entity9 remains the top tourist destination in the world , ’ said a statement for the city hall			0
ms @entity2 said : ‘ competition between the two giant metropolises is all well and good but we have to stick to the truth			1
‘ the figures show that @entity9 is still above @entity7 as the most visited city in the world ’ , adding : ‘ @entity9 is safer than @entity7 , where there is four times as much crime			1
@entity9 is also safer than @entity49 if you compare crime data			2
’ responding to reports of the masses of @entity56 gypsy gangs preying on tourists in @entity9 , ms @entity2 said : ‘ yes , there is a lot of talk about tourists in @entity9 being targeted and we need to deal with that			1
‘ that ’s why we are working with the museums , the police , the transport authorities and the tourist office			2
@entity2 said there was more crime in the @entity21 capital , less entrepreneurial businesses starting up , and fewer foreign visitors ‘ there are organized gangs of @entity76 criminals working here			1
we have to deal with this problem , but they also operate in other cities like @entity80 and @entity81			0
’ ms @entity2 , 54 , who was speaking to members of the @entity83 of @entity9 , said ' @entity7 is in some ways a suburb of @entity9 '			1
she said that there were too many giant retail corporations in @entity7			1
‘ shopping streets in @entity9 work when there ’s a variety of different types of shops , ’ she said			0
‘ this is what attracts customers and i will not change this culture just so we can have giant stores opening like in @entity7			1
’ bizarrely , she also claimed : ‘ @entity9 has more shops open on a sunday than @entity7			1
in @entity7 it is all big commercial centres but in @entity9 there is a network of small independent stores that are open			1
we want to protect these local stores ; this is the identity of @entity9			0
’ she also claimed : ' @entity9 has more shops open on a sunday than @entity7			1
in @entity7 it is all big commercial centres but in @entity9 there is a network of small independent stores that are open ' londoners may not like to hear this , but there may be some truth in @entity116 's pronouncement about @entity9 's crime figures being lower than the @entity29 's capital			1
at least where assaults are concerned			0
according to the @entity123 's website , there were 148,088 acts of violence against a person reported to the police in @entity7 in 2013			2
meanwhile , according to the most recent statistics available for @entity9 , recorded in 2011 , there were just 35,000 assaults reported			0
they are statistics for different years , but it 's not likely @entity9 's assault rate has changed dramatically in two years			0
however , when the population figures are taken into account , the difference narrows significantly			0
@entity9 has a population of 2.2million , meaning there are 16 assaults per 1,000 people			0
but @entity7 has a population of eight million , meaning there are 18 assaults per 1,000 people			2
in fact strict sunday trading laws still exist in @entity9 , while almost all shops are open in @entity7			2
and when it came to arguing that @entity9 was indeed a business - friendly city , @entity2 again chose to compare it to @entity7			1
ms @entity2 , who was born in @entity148 , also said : ‘ @entity9 is ahead of @entity7 in terms of the creation of start - ups			1
we will soon be home to the biggest start - up hub in the world			0
‘ yes @entity6 people go abroad to live and to work , but they come back , because of the public services that @entity6 can offer			0
just like the creches , for example			0
these are services of high quality that cost less than in @entity7			2
’ ms @entity2 did concede , however , that there was more dog mess in @entity9 , saying : ‘ it annoys me too			2
’ and she said that notoriously rude @entity165 could ‘ be a little kinder ’ to each other in the street so as not to upset tourists			0
visit @entity29 ’s 16 million figure was actually a projection based on visitor numbers for the first nine months of 2012 , said @entity9 city hall			0
in contrast , the 15.9 million figure for @entity9 was for the same period in 2012 , with the exact number for 2013 not yet finalised			0
in fact , say the @entity165 , there were 29 million visitors to @entity9 in the whole of 2012 , and 27.6 million to @entity7			1
as the war of words threatened to turn into a full scale diplomatic dispute , the @entity29 pointed to recent reports which highlighted how @entity9 was falling behind the times			0
a survey in 2013 revealed how @entity7 had stolen the ‘ @entity191 ’s @entity190 ’ title from @entity9 , with the authors describing how ‘ it should be a warning sign to all stakeholders of @entity9			1
’ the office of @entity193 put the city ’s success in attracting millions of visitors in 2013 down to the ‘ @entity198 effect ’ following the 2012 games			2
‘ the image of @entity7 has changed because of the @entity198 , ’ said @entity200 , deputy mayor			2
‘ people saw a beautiful city , open and vibrant and not just the usual cliches about @entity205 and the @entity206			0
