by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 11:32 est , 20 september 2013 unnecessary : @entity1 was restrained in handcuffs by police at a care home the family of a pensioner with @entity7 's , who was handcuffed by police at a care home and treated like a ' common criminal ' , have described the officers responsible as ' brutish '			1
@entity12 @entity1 , 76 , had been checked in to @entity13 care home in @entity15 , @entity16 , to give his full - time carer wife , @entity17 , a break			1
but less than 12 hours later , both mrs @entity20 and her and son @entity19 had to rush back to the home , where they found their loved - one with his arms behind his back , wearing handcuffs and in agony			1
the retired @entity30 worker was left with red sores on his wrists following the distressing ordeal and they say his condition has deteriorated since the incident on september 4			0
earlier today , mrs @entity20 , who has been married to her husband for 55 years , fumed : ' it ’s disgusting			1
' the police treated him like a common criminal , handcuffing his hands behind his back			2
' my husband has had childish tantrums in the past , but i ’ve always been able to calm him down			2
' we had left him in the care of professionals who are trained and paid to care for dementia patients			1
' it ’s terrible that he was treated like this , he must have been really frightened			0
' it was just awful			0
there were two of them as well and just one of him - he had no family with him at the time			1
' mrs @entity60 , said when her son spoke to one of the officers involved on the telephone after the incident , he was told the police were within their rights			1
she claims they then fobbed him off saying ' we have got better things to do '			0
mrs @entity60 added : ' their approach was unnecessarily brutish and completely uncalled for			1
' since the incident my husband has got worse			2
if you move towards him now he becomes agitated , as if he thinks you are going to do it again			2
' that is what makes me so angry			0
i want him to come home , and hopefully i ’ll be able to look after him as long as i can			2
' mrs @entity60 has now called for police to receive better training for dealing with people with dementia or mental health issues			1
she added : ' i have n’t got a lot of faith in the police any more			2
if they see a common criminal they run a mile but a 76 - year - old man with @entity7 ’s they go and handcuff			1
' i think they are n’t trained well enough to deal with people with dementia and similar issues			2
furious : mr @entity1 's wife @entity17 ( pictured here on the left alongside her daughter , @entity102 ) has accused @entity103 of ' brutish ' behaviour ' i do n’t think i should have to demand an apology from the police but i have n’t had one or spoke to them since and i do n’t expect to get one			1
' i want to speak out to make people with family members in similar situations aware what can happen			2
' fitness instructor @entity19 , 40 , added : ' @entity113 had been assessed by social workers in the run up to this respite , to make sure he was taken somewhere that could deal with his needs			0
' when we dropped him off the place seemed nice and friendly			0
but just a few hours later i got a call from his social worker saying he was upsetting some of the residents			0
' she assured us that she would deal with it			0
but then at 5am i received a call from the care home telling me that they had called the police to restrain my father			1
' they obviously got the assessment completely wrong when it came to my father			0
' mr @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity7 ’s five years ago			1
assessment : mr @entity1 was considered suitable for @entity13 , but just 12 hours after being admitted staff called the police when the pensioner became agitated @entity139 area manager @entity138 also criticised the police ’s approach and accused them of ' abusing ' the pensioner			1
he said : ' any case of abuse against a person with dementia is absolutely appalling			0
the most vulnerable people in our society should be treated with respect and dignity			0
' our care system in the @entity152 is broken and underfunded			0
we need to have a debate on how to ensure appropriate care is in place for people with conditions such as dementia			1
' we also need a regulatory system in place focused on supporting care homes to actively improve standards			0
' people with dementia can sometimes exhibit extreme agitation , particularly in times of stress			0
' it is vital that all staff who come into contact with people with dementia are given the skills and training to be able to spot the reasons behind these behaviours , so they can address them and hopefully reduce them			0
' yesterday @entity103 defended the use of handcuffs on the pensioner , who was sectioned for 28 days after the incident			0
insp @entity181 said : ' officers were called to a care home in @entity15 in the early hours of september 4 , due to concerns about the behaviour of a 76 - year - old man who was there for respite			1
' officers were aware he had dementia and other health problems but he was being extremely aggressive and it was necessary to handcuff him to prevent him from harming himself , other residents , and staff			0
' he was subsequently sectioned under the @entity197 and moved from the home			1
the family has not raised any issues with us			0
' a spokesperson for @entity203 said ' if someone with @entity7 ’s is detained under the act then we will always ensure they are taken to the most appropriate setting where they can access the expert care and treatment they need			2
' @entity212 , which runs the care home , declined to comment .			1

the family of a dementia *sufferer* have *slammed* police for ' brutish ' actions
@entity1 had been checked into a *council* - run care home
but 12 hours later the police were called when mr @entity1 became agitated
when mrs @entity60 arrived at the home she found her husband in agony
the 76 - year - old has since be detained for under the @entity197
