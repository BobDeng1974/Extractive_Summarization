@entity7 - eyed @entity6 , 10 , a pupil at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , noticed commas ' missing ' from two questions in her sats last tuesday			1
the @entity15 pupil says she was so ' annoyed ' by the basic punctuation errors that she wanted to take her complaint to the top			1
@entity6 , 10 , from @entity10 , wrote to education secretary @entity5 over punctuation errors in her sats so she wrote to mr @entity5 saying : ' i understand that you are very keen for us to all learn our complex sentences and use of accurate punctuation			1
' i believe that your department should also use the correct punctuation in all @entity30 tasks			0
' the schoolgirl said she hoped to hear back from mr @entity5			0
@entity6 , from @entity9 , said : ' the exam wording should be setting an example and i was annoyed			1
' i 've not heard back yet and am still waiting - mr @entity5 's busy but i do hope to get a response back			0
' the ' mistakes ' were in a section of the exam on complex sentences - and had commas ' missing ' from two sentences			1
education secretary @entity5 , left , and the letter he was sent by @entity10 schoolgirl @entity6 , right one sentence read : ' if there is not enough rainfall this month there will be a drought ' and ' as he was the chief of the tribe the final decision was his			1
' this afternoon a spokesman for the @entity50 defended the lack of commas in the exam paper			1
he said : ' the commas here are a matter of choice			2
they can be used to mark out clauses that appear at the beginning or the end of a sentence , but they are not necessary			0
' we decided to use commas sometimes and not at others to make the tests more like real life where people will have their own styles			2
' the only clauses that must be surrounded by commas are those in the middle of a sentence			2
' the same sentences - featuring commas in the correct places - had appeared in an earlier part of the exam on grammar			1
around half a million pupils around the country took the same exam last week			0
bright spark : @entity6 discussed the errors in her exam with schoolfriends before writing to mr @entity5 @entity6 's mother @entity89 , 40 , a town planner , said : ' a group of children were discussing in the playground that there had been a mistake and that it was n't right			1
' @entity6 said she thought she should write to whoever was responsible and found that it was @entity5			1
i helped her write the letter and we emailed it			0
' it 's great that she decided to do it			0
generally , i encourage her to do these types of things - to stand up to the people who are supposed to be setting an example			0
i 'm fully behind her			0
' the @entity107 is meant to check if exams are up to scratch before pupils take them , but a spokesman insisted that using commas in complex sentences was ' a matter of choice '			1
@entity6 's teacher @entity116 said many of his pupils noticed the mistake when they undertook the new spelling , punctuation and grammar test			1
he said : ' i laughed my head off when i had heard that @entity6 had sent the letter			1
she obviously felt moved enough by the mistakes			0
' @entity126 has advised countdown contestants ( and hosts ) on linguistic matters since 1992 @entity126 , the resident word expert on @entity131 , says that while adding a comma into the two sentences @entity6 complained about would help them flow better , it is not essential in either one			1
mrs @entity126 , 45 , who has sat in the @entity138 show 's @entity136 adjudicating on linguistic matters since 1992 , told @entity140 the comma ' serves as a signpost , helping us to understand what lies ahead and , in many cases , removing ambiguity '			2
she added : ' each of these two sentences has a subordinate clause ( a combination of words that do not form a complete sentence and which require another to complete the thought : ' if there is not enough rainfall this month ' , and ' as he was the chief of the tribe ' both need more information before the sentence is complete )			0
' adding a comma after each clause in these cases would make the sentences and their style flow smoothly , slowing them down almost to the rhythm of natural speech			0
' however , in these particular instances , the comma is not essential and is more a matter of style than necessity ; the reader will understand what is being said without them			0
' a comma in the wrong place , however , can change the meaning entirely : ' if there is not enough rainfall , this month there will be a drought )			0
@entity177 - educated mrs @entity126 is the longest - serving member of @entity131 on - screen team , and has appeared with presenters including the much - loved @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and current host , @entity184			2
mrs @entity126 , who studied modern languages at @entity186 , @entity177 , before studying @entity187 at @entity188 , worked as a language teacher and in publishing before going to work for the @entity191			2
