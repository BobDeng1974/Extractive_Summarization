letting the @entity1 dictate the direction of the @entity4 government would be like getting @entity5 to ' run a baby farm ' , @entity0 warned today in an escalation of @entity9 attacks on the @entity10			1
the @entity9 london mayor warned against allowing @entity12 's @entity10 to dominate the government of the @entity4 , ' an entity that they are sworn to destroy '			1
he likened it to ' asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery '			0
@entity9 @entity20 mayor @entity0 warned against allowing @entity12 's @entity10 to dominate the government of the @entity4 ' an entity that they are sworn to destroy ' ms @entity12 launched her @entity10 manifesto today , boasting that she can ' lead the @entity4 ' with polices on @entity4 foreign policy , benefits , energy bills and @entity28 university tuition fees			1
the @entity10 leader vowed to use a surge in support for her party to dictate the direction of the @entity4 government , calling for an end to austerity , rising benefits payments and the abolition of @entity37 as the price @entity39 would have to pay for propping up a weak @entity41 government			1
ms @entity12 set out a ' programme for delivery on a @entity4 - wide basis ' , raising the prospect of @entity47 nationalist mps calling the shots on policies which apply only in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
polls suggest up to half of @entity47 are planning to vote @entity10 , handing the party dozens of seats and leaving @entity41 's @entity39 unable to secure a majority			2
the @entity10 has claimed that it will be ' entitled to vote against any bit of legislation ' and ' any bit of spending ' it does not agree with			2
mr @entity0 , who is expected to play a more high profile role in the @entity9 campaign from this week , issued a blunt warning about allowing an @entity66 party to dictate policy in @entity68			0
' you would n't get @entity70 to run a baby farm , would you ? , ' he wrote in the @entity72			0
' it would not normally occur to you to interview a convicted jewel thief for the post of custodian of the @entity77			0
' you would not dream of asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery or @entity83 to work as a doorkeeper for the @entity86 senate			0
' any such course of action would be totally nuts			0
so can someone tell me why in the name of all that is holy there are some apparently rational people who are even contemplating the elevation of the @entity10 to a position of effective dominance in the government of the @entity4 - an entity that they are sworn to destroy ? ' he said the @entity10 want to ' end @entity4 , to decapitate @entity100 ' but mr @entity39 has no chance of entering @entity102 without their support			1
@entity12 today demanded an end to austerity as the price for propping up a @entity41 government in what was quickly dubbed a £ 140billion ' ransom note ' for @entity4 the @entity10 want higher taxes , to scrap @entity37 and end efforts to reform the welfare system , mr @entity0 warned			1
mr @entity39 will be left ' sitting in the driving seat , pretending to be steering the car - but all the time he will have clever @entity12 next to him , whispering in his ear , and perpetually yanking the steering wheel to the @entity117 '			2
speaking at her manifesto launch , ms @entity12 said she had not ' heard the comments of @entity0 directly '			2
but speaking at the @entity10 manifesto launch , she said : ' if he did say that , then that is an entirely offensive comment , and i think it will be treated as that not just by people in @entity47 but across the @entity4 , who , in my experience , ordinary people the length and breadth of the @entity4 do not see @entity47 that way at all and do not see the @entity10 in that way at all			1
' however , the warning was echoed by @entity136 today , in a speech setting out the risks to @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 if the @entity1 are calling the shots			1
the prime minister yesterday suggested key services like roads and hospitals in the rest of the @entity4 would suffer as a price of @entity10 support			2
'' this would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country			0
i think that is a frightening prospect , ' he told @entity165 's @entity164 show			0
' people thinking in their own constituencies , is that bypass going to be built , will my hospital get the money it needs ? frankly this is a group of people that would n't care about what happened in the rest of the country			0
' the rest of the @entity4 – @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , would n't get a look - in			1
' that is the prospect we face if we do n't get the majority @entity182 government that is in our reach			0
