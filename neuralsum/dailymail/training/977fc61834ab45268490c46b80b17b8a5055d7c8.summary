it is 6.30am on the @entity1 just outside of @entity2			2
four lifelong followers of @entity4 are in a @entity5 508 , the @entity6 loaded for the railway town of @entity8 in @entity9			1
the mood is one of optimism			0
for the past fortnight the @entity4 have been purring in the wake of their 3 - 1 win victory over @entity15			1
@entity16 – the 58 - year - old assistant editor of the fanzine @entity18 – and his three pals spend the next six hours debating team selection – @entity22 versus @entity23 – and tactics – two up front versus lone frontman @entity26			1
as the quartet will later learn , it matters not			0
@entity4 's player collapse on the floor during their humiliating 8 - 0 defeat on the south coast they arrive at their @entity33 in @entity8 , settle the £ 60 room rate , square up £ 20 a man for petrol and dish out the match tickets - a relatively reasonable £ 24 each – leaving £ 50 in their back pocket for a few beers – they ’ ll certainly need them as the day transpires			1
they then jump on a train to @entity42 where they join 2,500 fellow supporters for saturday afternoon ’s game at @entity45			1
and so the nightmare begins			0
by 3.20pm their side are trailing by two , the first an absolute belter of a volley from @entity51			0
the @entity52 , however , is a @entity4 defender rather than a @entity42 striker			1
just over an hour later it is 5 - 0			1
‘ at 5 - 0 we were angry , ’ reflects @entity16			1
come full - time , however , fury had made way for gallows humour , the scoreboard reading a humiliating 8 - 0			1
the electronic scoreboard at @entity45 's displays the full extent of the defeat for the travelling supporters ‘ it was just comedic come the end , ’ @entity16 continues			1
‘ we were just laughing at how bad it was – it had gone way past being angry			1
‘ in a perverse way we actually started supporting the team and the away end was bouncing – some things never cease to amaze me			0
‘ a few of the players came over to applaud – the goalkeeper @entity77 was nearly crying – but a couple of them were down the tunnel faster than they ’d moved all day			0
‘ it was a shocking performance , as bad as i ’ve seen			2
’ so had 90 minutes ruined an entire weekend ? ‘ yes , ’ @entity16 returns without hesitation			0
‘ the match completely spoilt the day			0
the home fans revel in the delight of their team 's destruction of a hapless @entity4 side ‘ it was embarrassing			1
the own goals were comical			0
the first one , a striker would have been proud of it , and that set the tone for the day really			0
’ the crestfallen @entity77 later insisted the players should refund fans who made the trek to the @entity98			2
‘ i would rather they ’d just put on a performance and got three points , ’ @entity16 – a retired engineer , father of two and grandfather of two - says of @entity77 ’s suggestion			2
‘ but it would be a nice gesture i suppose – money back or tickets for a game in the future			2
’ travelling supporters sit stony - faced after watching @entity112 's side concede their sixth goal of the afternoon tickets for a game in the future ? ‘ yeah , of course , i ’ll still be going home and away , ’ he counters			1
‘ it was like being punched in the face and yeah , it was horrible , but we ’ll be back			2
that ’s what you do			0
‘ we held the post-mortem over a few beers on saturday night			0
thankfully , we missed the start of @entity129 because we were first on			0
‘ we drove back up yesterday and did n’t even mention the game			2
i think we all just wanted to get home as soon as possible			0
’ home – that is probably where they wish they had stayed all along			0
@entity4 fans had a staggering 653.4 mile round trip to watch their team lose 8 - 0 to @entity42 video an unbelievable result - @entity139			1

@entity4 lost 8 - 0 to @entity42 at @entity45 's
one group of travelling fans said it was so bad they ended up laughing
there and back , @entity4 's fans had to travel over *650* miles
