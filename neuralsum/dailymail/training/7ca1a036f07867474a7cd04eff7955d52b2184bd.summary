by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 airman who was the inspiration for @entity6 ’s character in the @entity7 has died at the age of 93			1
flight lieutenant @entity9 was a prisoner of war and like @entity6 in the classic movie he spent most of his time in solitary confinement			1
@entity13 mr @entity9 was part of the legendary escape from @entity17 camp and was named as the inspiration for the @entity6 character in the 1963 film			1
he was the inspiration for @entity6 's character in the 1963 film @entity24 , in which allied prisoners tunnel their way out of a @entity28 pow camp mr @entity9 as a young man at the start of @entity31 ( right ) and as an older man during his career with the @entity34 ( left ) but modest mr @entity9 said he had little in common with @entity6 ’s character - except for the amount of time they spent in ' the cooler '			1
after the film came out he said : ' he is taller than i am , i ’m heavier than he is , he ’s @entity41 and i ’m a @entity13			2
' the only things we ’ve got in common is that we both annoyed the @entity45 and ended up doing stretches in the cooler			2
' i did n’t get out and if i did , i would n’t have been able to ride a motorbike anyway			2
' @entity6 played captain @entity24 , the ' @entity49 ' in the movie in which he is captured after leaping a barbed wire fence on a motorbike			2
@entity6 poses on the motorbike he rode in the film at the @entity57 - @entity45 border			1
in reality , none of the prisoners escaped on a bike the wreckage of mr @entity9 ' plane , pictured in 1969 , after he was shot down over a lake in @entity65 as a young man in 1942 if was from the crash in @entity65 that he was captured and taken to the infamous @entity28 prisoner of war camp			1
the wreckage was found and pictured in 1969 in reality , none of the prisoners used a motorbike to escape			0
mr @entity9 was one of the men caught in the tunnel when the break - out was discovered by a @entity45 guard			1
of the 76 escapees from @entity17 camp , only three managed to reach @entity3 - the other 73 were recaptured , and 50 were killed			2
only two of these escapees remain alive today - @entity82 , from @entity83 , and @entity84 , who lives in @entity85 , @entity86			0
a tunnel dug underneath the @entity17 prisoner of war camp , from which 76 people escaped mr @entity9 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , joined the @entity34 at the age of 18 at the outbreak of @entity31 and flew @entity95 bombers in raids over @entity45			1
he became a prisoner of war after his aircraft was shot down in flames over @entity65 in 1942			0
the young airman was captured and taken to @entity17 where it was considered the sworn duty of officers to escape			2
his memory as a prisoner of war was being ' bored to tears ' , constantly hungry and finding himself banged up in solitary confinement or the ‘ cooler ’ as it was known by @entity41 prisoners			0
on the night of the breakout , mr @entity9 was lucky to escape with his life as the last man to be pulled from the tunnel as @entity45 shots rang out in the darkness			1
mr @entity9 ’s funeral will take place next saturday at @entity118 in @entity91			1
the character @entity119 , played by @entity120 , crawling through the tunnel in @entity24 @entity24 's legendary motorbike chase scene starring @entity6 shows his character - based on @entity9 - attempting to outrun @entity28 prison guards on a motorbike			1
in reality , this element to the story was completely fabricated			0
none of the prisoners tried to flee on a motorbike			0
while 76 prisoners actually escaped , all except three were recaptured			0
of this 73 , 50 were soon recaptured and executed			0
although the film was accurate in this respect , the ones who successfully made it home in the film were not the same as those who did so in real life			0
although mr @entity9 was @entity22 , the movie producers made @entity6 's character an @entity41 , presumably to give the film more appeal to @entity41 audiences			1
many other characters were composites , based on a number of real - life prisoners			0
in fact none of the prisoners involved in the real prison escape were @entity41 - they were entirely @entity3 and other @entity154 troops , including @entity86 and @entity155			0
@entity41 troops had been moved from the prison in the months before the escape tunnels were ready , although they had helped significantly with the digging .			0

@entity9 inspired @entity6 's character in 1963 film @entity24
flight lieutenant @entity9 was a pow at the infamous @entity28 prison @entity17
the @entity13 was caught in the prisoner - dug tunnels by a @entity45 guard
mr @entity9 : ' if i did get out , i would *n't* have been able to ride a motorbike '
he has now died at the age of 93 , with his funeral to be held in north @entity22
