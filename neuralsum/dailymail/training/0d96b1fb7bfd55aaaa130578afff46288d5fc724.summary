by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 man on holiday in @entity5 has rescued two large loggerhead turtles from potentially ending up on a dinner menu			1
@entity8 , 44 , was horrified when he saw two 5ft loggerheads with their fins tied up , on their backs struggling to breathe in the garden of a bar on @entity14 off the east coast of the @entity17 country			1
the animals had been dragged from the sea and left to suffocate before they would have been butchered and served up as a local delicacy			2
it is thought that once dead , the woman would have sold the meat on the black market			2
mr @entity8 rang the police to report the illegal activity , which sadly is becoming increasingly common in @entity5			1
@entity3 tourist @entity41 was horrified when he saw two 5ft loggerheads with their fins tied on their backs struggling to breathe in the garden of a bar on @entity14 off the east coast of @entity5 having been given the go - ahead by the police , the rescue team put the turtles on to carts and wheeled them back to the sea safety in sight : at the beach the rescue team cut the ties that bind and prepare to release the turtles almost there : the end of their ordeal is close at hand as the rescuers prepare to return the sea reptiles to the brine the cart is submerged gently to allow the turtles time to acclimatise to being back in the sea while he waited for the police , mr @entity8 rounded up a large group of tourists and divers to help rescue the dying animals " sometimes you are faced with a situation so outrageous that you have no other choice than to intervene and right a wrong , â€™ he said			1
" these poor creatures are endangered enough but to leave them to die like this was inhumane so we had to act			2
" easy does it : the turtles had been left on their backs to stop them struggling and hurting themselves the wooden carts are slowly lowered and the turtle is all but immersed in the salty water one final maintenance check before the turtles are released into their natural habitat the team spent 30 minutes pouring buckets of water over the animals to try to revive them			0
by the time the police arrived , the turtles were breathing again and the police ordered them to be released			0
the turtles were put on to carts and taken back to the sea			0
once in the water the rescuers , with the help of the @entity102 , a non-profit , marine conservation organisation , eased the turtles back into swimming before cutting their ties			0
" we left them on their backs to stop them from struggling and tearing their fins apart , " @entity8 , a @entity107 and former paramedic , added			0
" once we cut the ties they went off like the clappers , it was wonderful to see			0
" a growing trend in sea turtle meat is thought to be behind the drastically reducing numbers of the endangered species across the world			1
in @entity5 it is estimated more than 35,000 sea turtles are killed each year so they can be sold at significantly high prices for their meat and eggs across the world			1
the turtle , freed from its restraints , flaps its fins and ' went off like the clappers ' one last check and the turtle is released back into the wild			0
