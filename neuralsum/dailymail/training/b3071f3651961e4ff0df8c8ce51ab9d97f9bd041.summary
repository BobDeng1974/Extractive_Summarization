speaking from @entity8 , brigadier @entity31 , commander of @entity65 , said : ' if i speak to my @entity6 counterparts , they are hugely grateful for the investment of the @entity4 forces here in central @entity13			1

above , soldiers clean their weapons at @entity8 dismantling : one of the bases to be dismantled was @entity95 , which was shut down yesterday			2
above , brigadier @entity31 poses at @entity8 he said he had seen huge progress in central @entity13 since his last tour of duty in 2009/10 , which gave him ' hope for the future ' - adding : ' it is really difficult for people in the @entity4 to understand the changes			1
' they are really proud of the progress they have made , i just wish we could capture that and take that back to the @entity4 , but i have seen it through my eyes and it is really powerful stuff			2
' he said he had particularly noticed a difference in @entity119 - e @entity118 , which had been transformed from ' a warzone ' into somewhere now ' primarily peaceful '			0
and when asked if the sacrifice of the 448 @entity4 lives had been worth it , he said : ' it is always a difficult question to ask when there has been a human cost here in central @entity13			1
successful operation : defence secretary @entity130 ( pictured ) said the handover and closure of @entity4 bases across @entity13 ' underlines the progress @entity4 forces have made to increase security and stability across the province ' ' i guess ultimately history will judge the worth of what we 've been doing at our government 's request here			1
' two of the bases handed over to @entity6 control in recent weeks include @entity148 ( @entity150 ) @entity149 - the former headquarters of @entity4 military forces in @entity6 - and @entity153 ( @entity154 ) @entity155			1
and @entity8 itself - the main military headquarters of @entity4 forces in @entity6 - is expected to be shut down by the end of the year			1
the handovers are the latest milestones in a drawdown that has seen @entity4 bases reduce from 137 at the height of the campaign , while @entity6 forces are now leading 97 per cent of all security operations across the country and carrying out over 90 per cent of their own training			1
defence secretary @entity130 said : ' the handover and closure of our bases across @entity13 underlines the progress @entity4 forces have made to increase security and stability across the province but also to build up the capability of the @entity6 forces who will carry that work forward			1
' those service personnel who have served in @entity149 and @entity180 and at @entity181 as part of successive @entity4 brigades have made a huge contribution to the campaign which has safeguarded our national security at home			2
' @entity4 combat operations will cease by the end of this year but our support for the @entity6 people will continue			2
meanwhile , our troops will continue the mammoth task of getting our people and equipment home by @entity196			2
' @entity4 's main base at @entity149 , which opened in 2006 and served as the headquarters of @entity65 until it moved to @entity8 in august , was handed over to the @entity6 in a ceremony on february 24			1
meanwhile , @entity155 , which commands an important junction in @entity13 , was handed over to the @entity6 on march 8			2
and @entity95 ( @entity150 ) , the @entity4 's largest forward location for most of @entity202 , was shut down yesterday			2
lieutenant general @entity203 , deputy commander of @entity204 , the most senior @entity205 in @entity6 , said : ' this is a key milestone in the @entity204 mission as we prepare for the conclusion of combat operations at the end of 2014			2
' these bases have been vital in the @entity4 contribution to securing the south of the country from the insurgency and their handover underlines the progress being made in reducing the @entity204 footprint			2
" he told the @entity222 that he had ' no doubts ' that @entity6 forces will be able to look after their own security beyond the end of this year			2
he said the @entity227 had grown into a ' competent organisation ' , who were : ' capable , confident in themselves , and credible in the eyes of the @entity6 people '			0
' everything i 've seen since i 've been out here this time , since june last year , leads me to believe that the @entity6 will be able to look after their own security , ' he said			0
lieutenant colonel @entity236 , commanding officer of @entity237 , agreed that the drawdown was a sign of how successful the @entity227 had been in taking over the fighting role in the country			0
positive : brigadier @entity243 said he had seen huge progress in @entity13 since his last tour of duty in 2009/10 , giving him ' hope for the future '			0

above , ammunition boxes and explosive containers are pictured at @entity8 in march this year however , he added that tearing down bases which @entity4 troops ' fought so hard to build ' in @entity6 carries a certain amount of sentimentality for those who have served there over the last few years			1
' for those who have completed a number of tours there will be a sentimental aspect to it , ' he said			0
' i think it is satisfying to see the move that has taken place because if you look where @entity6 was over a decade ago and where it is now , it is unrecognisable			0
' if we roll forward to where we are now and one can look at it that we are tearing down structures that we fought so hard to build , it is a sign of development and i see it very much as a part of mission success for the @entity227 because they have developed to a point where we do n't need those points of presence			0
' lt col @entity236 likened the programme to dismantling an entire village and carting it away - with the difference being that they have to stay safe , secure and supplied until the last soldiers leave			0

he said what home comforts the base had - including a canteen and a gym - were slowly taken away - and for the last 10 days , the soldiers had eaten field rations and lived out of what they could carry in their rucksacks			0
' we are an infantry company , being out and about and doing stuff on the ground is what we do , ' he said			0
' the guys are very , very adaptable			0
' as long as they have got the basics of life , as long as they have somewhere to wash , as long as they have decent food , as long as they have a way of talking to home , they will adapt to whatever they are told to do			0
' the dismantling of @entity311 was led by captain @entity340 , of @entity342 - based @entity341			0
equipment left in several ways , including helicopter , combat logistic patrols ( @entity347 ) and regular road lorries , he said , all inside @entity350 shipping containers			0
speaking before the base closed , capt @entity340 said : ' i 'm now dreaming of iso containers			0
there have been so many here , every day we are sending out 20 to 30 , and it is a nightmare			0
you wake up in the middle of the night thinking " did this container go ? "			0
' he said that with 20 - 30 different military and civilian units involved in the closure , it had been impossible to keep everyone happy			0
he added : ' on the last day when everything is loaded , when the last vehicles are about to go and the last helicopters are about to go out and we leave this place , it will be quite a nice feeling			0
i 'm not going to miss this place			0
