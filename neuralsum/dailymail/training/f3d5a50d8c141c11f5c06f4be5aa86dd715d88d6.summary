by @entity0 - parkinson published : 08:51 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 20:15 est , 28 march 2013 a judge warned foreign criminals yesterday that @entity3 is not a ‘ soft touch ’ as he jailed a @entity5 gang for a £ 1million theft campaign			1
the ten gang members exploited @entity10 border laws to travel freely between @entity5 and the @entity3 purely to steal high - quality gold from @entity13 and @entity14 jewellery shops			1
the ‘ professional ’ criminals aged between 20 and 30 were chastised by @entity17 judge @entity16 for not having done ‘ an honest day ’s work while they were here ’			1
scroll down to see the robberies on cctv the gang of @entity5 armed robbers , sentenced to a total of 82 years for six jewellery shop robberies , can be seen here emptying the glass cabinets having smashed into them with a sledgehammer			1
members of staff can be seen kneeling on the floor as the shop 's alarms billow out thick smoke , with little effect this robbery shows one of the thieves holding a door open to prevent it from being locked shut while another smashes through an inner door with a sledgehammer they were handed sentences totalling 82 years and ten months for seven ruthless raids between march and september last year			1
one of the gang , @entity44 , 25 , had told police when he was arrested : ‘ i do n’t care , i go to prison to go on holiday			1
’ he got seven years			0
all will be deported after they have served their sentences			2
it is believed most of the gang , some of whom giggled and smirked in the dock , travelled to @entity3 using tourist visas before settling illegally on a makeshift campsite on wasteland in @entity59 , @entity60			1
when @entity5 joined the @entity10 in 2007 its citizens were granted freedom to travel to @entity3 , with restrictions on the number who could legally settle here			1
judge @entity16 acknowledged there are fears there will be an influx of @entity5 when restrictions on the number who can move to @entity3 are lifted from january 1			1

' no one should think for a moment that courts in the @entity3 will be a soft touch			2
sentences such as these must be seen as a powerful and effective deterrent not only to home - grown but also imported criminals			0
