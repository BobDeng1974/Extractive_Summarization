authorities say that while @entity1 teammates and friends knew him as a hardworking wide receiver and married father , @entity0 was fashioning a separate identity as a wannabe drug kingpin with a focus on ' high - end deals ' and a need for large amounts of drugs			1
@entity36 district judge @entity35 gave @entity0 a much shorter sentence than the 27 to 34 years recommended by federal sentencing guidelines			1
@entity39 noted that the case against @entity0 centered on a ' lot of agreements ' to buy and sell marijuana and cocaine , rather than physical transactions of drugs			1

wide receiver : @entity0 during the @entity1 game between the @entity66 and the @entity67 @entity0 's december 2011 arrest outside a suburban @entity70 steakhouse came after he tried to buy a kilogram of cocaine in what turned out to be a sting			1

he claimed he was already distributing 4 kilograms a week , according to the complaint			0
a kilogram is about 2.2 pounds			0

one of his lawyers , @entity133 , called his client ' a guy showing up at a restaurant , talking stupid			0
' ' i think he should be punished , but for the crime that he committed , ' @entity133 said			0
short sentence : @entity36 district judge @entity35 gave @entity0 , pictured in 2011 , a much shorter sentence than the 27 to 34 years recommended by federal sentencing guidelines but @entity0 's failed drug tests and alleged dealings with @entity93 appeared to factor heavily against him wednesday			1
prosecutors repeatedly brought up @entity93 - rejecting claims by @entity0 and his attorneys that the two men were talking about @entity0 's attempts to start a t - shirt printing business			2
' normally , when you dig a hole , you quit digging , ' said prosecutor @entity151			0
' but he keeps digging			0

' but while he gained extra notoriety due to his now - finished football career , prosecutors said @entity0 's case was simple			2
