the message , as @entity1 relaxed at his @entity3 media conference overlooking @entity5 ’s @entity4 , was that @entity6 have not even thought about the maths			1
the @entity6 assistant coach insisted his squad are not interested in points - difference — just winning a test match against @entity12			1
they have piped a respectful tune towards today ’s opponents but there is a title on the line and head coach @entity18 knows that his side must go for the juggernaut victory at the @entity22			2
the @entity23 needs his back line to go full throttle and take every point they can to close the gap on @entity30 and @entity31			2
wales were heaped with praise for their defensive display last week but — with the wingers in danger of not scoring a try all tournament for the first time since 1995 — wing @entity39 is ready to shift the focus towards attack			1
@entity39 insists @entity6 will pile on the points against @entity12 in @entity5 @entity1 says the first objective is to win the game ‘ we know a lot of things need to happen , ’ said @entity39			1
‘ we are on first so we ’ll go out , do the business and then sit back and watch the other matches			1
it would be nice for one of us wingers to get on the scoresheet , but it is n’t about me or @entity57 getting across the line			2
the only thing that matters is getting the job done			2
’ @entity39 and @entity57 both scored during last year ’s 51 - 3 rout of @entity62 on the final day of the competition			1
a similar scoreline in @entity5 would make @entity18 ’s side big favourites for the title although they would have to wait for their reward as the new trophy is already at @entity70 and its replica in @entity72			1
for @entity39 , it is a chance to silence his critics once and for all			1
the 23 - year - old @entity76 , formerly a blast - furnace worker , was targeted on social media during last year ’s tour of @entity80			2
his shoulder charge gave the @entity83 a decisive penalty try and he was then sent off in his first club game of the season			2
@entity39 was ordered to improve his discipline and has subsequently conceded one penalty in six tests , compared to 13 in his first 16			1
‘ i had to learn the hard way , ’ he said			2
‘ some did n’t want me to be picked in a red shirt again			2
i had quite a lot of stick , but it goes in one ear and out the other			0
on @entity97 , i just blocked people who were having a go			0
it was rubbish , really			0
you do n’t need it			0
@entity18 will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the @entity106 @entity6 , pictured this week in training , have travelled to @entity5 knowing a win could secure @entity109 glory ‘ i hope they ’re happy that i ’ve started four out of five games in this @entity109			1
i ’ve worked on my discipline and it ’s going well			0
i ’m trying to handle situations differently — do what i have to do and then get out , instead of getting involved in stupid things			0
keep my body in the oven and my head in the freezer			0
’ sharing his surname with famous predecessors — @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 to name three — @entity39 will now hope to match their big - game temperament			1
he will look to the forwards to provide a platform for victory — although the front - row casualty list is a worry — but it is up to the back line to deliver a title - winning scoreline			1
the absence of @entity139 is a huge boost for @entity6			1
the @entity12 captain has a foot injury and the odds of @entity6 winning the title shifted when his omission was confirmed			1
@entity145 passes the ball during an open session in @entity148 on tuesday @entity149 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) lead the celebrations after beating @entity31 last week but , sticking to message , @entity1 talked up the quality of his cover			0
‘ he caused us a lot of problems last year , ’ he said			0
‘ he is a fantastic player , a world - class no 8 , and if he ’s not playing they are going to miss him			0
but they have good players in their back row			0
@entity139 did n’t play two years ago but they were pretty strong			0
’ @entity139 ’s absence should temper @entity12 ’s gung - ho approach while the captaincy has been handed to hooker @entity167			1
@entity6 centre @entity168 said this week that @entity31 should ‘ fear the wounded animal ’ of @entity62 , but @entity12 are also limping after losing to @entity171 so @entity6 must also be on their guard			1
‘ we ’ve got more than one point to prove , ’ said @entity167			0
‘ everything starts from our first phase and our scrum has to be at its best			0
we have guys like @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 with good experience			0
@entity139 is a big loss — he could play in every national team in the world — but we have to keep believing			0

wales are one of three teams in with a chance of winning the @entity109
wales travel to @entity5 to face @entity12 at the @entity193
@entity39 says @entity6 will go out and do the business
