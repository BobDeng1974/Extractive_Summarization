@entity0 has revealed the incredible moments in a specially set up ' war room ' inside its hq as its @entity4 landed on the red planet			1
the unprecedented insight reveals the drama the 34 scientists allowed into the inner sanctum , which was separate from mission control , went through during @entity4 's descent to the surface of the red planet			1
it even reveals the carefully chosen words that signified a perfect landing - tango delta nominal			1
@entity18 ( @entity19 ) ' war room ' and its staff			1
on the night of aug. 5 , 2012 @entity22 ( early morning aug. 6 edt ) , 34 engineers gathered in this room at @entity0 's @entity24 in @entity25 , to support the landing twenty - five of @entity0 's engineers are pictured above			1
from the left , back row , they are : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 at the end			0
starting from the top of the table and moving left are : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
in the closest row , from the left , are : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
the image above shows the team at work			1
" if we said ' touchdown , ' then people not intimately familiar with @entity19 might infer that @entity4 was good to go , " said @entity48 , a 42 - year - old engineer from @entity64 , said on @entity0 's web site			0
he admits the touchdown was the first of three key message the team hoped to hear			1
' two more major calls had to be made before i could begin to breathe again			0
' the key moment for the team occured at 10:32 p.m local time			1
diaries from the crew reveal there had been a debate amongst @entity4 's entry , descent and landing team about what their first words to indicate that the rover had reached the surface should be			1
the team at @entity0 's @entity24 knew their microphones would be ' hot ' and that @entity90 was beaming the landing event out live to anybody with the desire and wherewithal to watch			1
they also knew that landing safely on @entity96 meant more than simply landing on @entity96 - which any one of the 34 engineers present at @entity24 's @entity98 230 , also known as the ' @entity99 , ' will tell you at great length is not simple at all			1
their rocket - propelled backpack and rover - lowering @entity105 system were getting their first test 154 million miles ( 248 million kilometers ) away from home			1
at 10:31:45 p.m. @entity22 , @entity58 saw the event record , or @entity109 , she was looking for appear on her computer screen in the @entity111			0
she told @entity0 's site she knew that the ' touchdown ' message would only be beamed down if the rover 's descent stage had throttled down , a result which could only occur if the descent stage had offloaded half its weight			2
the only way the rover could offload half its weight in an instant is if it were being held up from below			2
@entity124 , a member of the @entity19 team and an engineer from @entity127 in @entity128 , gave the much reviewed , pre-scripted call - ' @entity130 nominal			2
' tango and @entity130 are phonetic identifiers for @entity133 and @entity134 , which the team used to represent touchdown			2
the next call the @entity19 team was looking for was ' @entity138			2
' ' @entity138 stands for @entity139 , ' said @entity48			0
' the @entity138 gives us the rover 's orientation as well as any movement it is making			2
' if we landed on a crumbling crater wall or an unstable sand dune , or were being dragged by a still - connected descent stage across the surface , then the @entity138 would show that in its data set			2
' researchers in @entity0 's main mission control celebrating the landing			1
however , @entity0 has now revealed its key researchers were in a special ' war room ' for the landing the @entity99 's @entity52 , an engineer from @entity24 , was monitoring that unit 's performance			1
eight long seconds after @entity58 's call , he found the @entity109 he was looking for			0
' @entity138 , " said @entity52			0
the final confirmation actually came from a different building , @entity0 said			0
there , in the @entity160 of @entity24 's @entity161 , @entity162 , the mission 's @entity19 phase lead , was staring across the room at @entity166 , who was not making eye contact with anyone			1
@entity166 , the @entity19 communications engineer , was staring at his screen			0
final destination : @entity171 recently sent back this high resolution picture of its landing site and its destination , called @entity175 , in the distance			2
his task was not to check for a good - news @entity109 from the rover			1
instead , he was waiting to see if the @entity183 signal became intermittent , faded away or just cut out altogether - all potential indications that the rover and descent stage had not gone their separate ways			2
eight seconds after the @entity188 looked up			0
' @entity183 strong , ' said @entity166			0
with that , @entity162 had all the data he needed			0
seated directly in front of the pacing @entity193 , @entity191 felt a jab in the shoulder			0
@entity191 , the mission 's ( capsule communicator ) , knew it could only mean one thing			0
' touchdown confirmed , ' said @entity191 .			0
