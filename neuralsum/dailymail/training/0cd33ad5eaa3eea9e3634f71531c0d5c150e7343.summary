@entity2 sent a letter and disturbing images to @entity13 , the new chief executive of @entity15 queen elizabeth hospital in @entity6			1
but the package was opened by a young female member of staff at the hospital , who was left ' distressed ' and upset by its graphic contents			1
@entity23 @entity22 was told it was the third time the 81 - year - old activist had breached an asbo banning him from sending abortion - related material to any person , hospital , doctor , medical practice or public authority			1
the ban was imposed on life - long anti-abortion campaigner @entity2 , who lives in @entity35 , near @entity36 , in 2006			2
the hospital had previously been flooded with thousands of angry letters containing similarly explicit material from @entity2 's supporters in the @entity40 after he last went on the warpath over abortion			1
@entity2 admitted breaching the order at court on monday and was given a three - month jail term , suspended for 18 months			1
the asbo was extended until march 2017 and he was given a three - month curfew			2
judge @entity47 accepted @entity2 had been a life - long activist against abortion but said he had to comply with the order however much he disagreed with it			1
he warned the pensioner that if he breached it he would be jailed			0
' if you commit an offence in the future this sentence will take effect , ' judge @entity47 said			0
@entity60 , defending , said @entity2 now realised there were other ways of putting his views across			2
' there are legal ways he can protest which would ensure he would not come before the courts again , ' she said			0
she said the pensioner had wanted to make contact with the new chief executive as he was also aggrieved that his ban meant he could not get his hip replacement carried out at @entity14 but had to go elsewhere			1
@entity72 : the pensioner sent a package of extreme anti-abortion material to @entity15 queen elizabeth hospital miss @entity60 said the package @entity2 sent to the hospital had carried a warning stating that it was not to be opened by anyone who might be offended by the material			1
' it was not his intention to cause alarm , ' she said			0
' the envelope was clearly marked			0
' ' no one deserves to be on the receiving end of hate mail ' hospital spokesman after the case @entity2 said that the sentence would not stop him battling to outlaw abortions			1
' i am not going to stop until the scourge of abortion has been lifted from our law , ' he said			2
@entity2 was supported in court by @entity99 , 65 , a long - time campaigner against under - age sex			2
the mother - of - 10 said she was supporting him because no law was above criticism			0
mrs @entity99 , of @entity104 , said : ' it felt like a sick joke to see someone like @entity108 at his age and infirmity threatened with jail			0
' speaking after @entity2 was sentenced , a @entity14 spokesman said : ' this mail was opened by members of our administration staff who found it very disturbing and upsetting			1
' following an earlier case some years ago we were inundated with extremist mail from around the world			0
' ' all this had to be processed and responses provided , which used valuable public time and money			0
' ' the more extreme letters were referred to the police and appropriate action was taken			0
' ' no one deserves to be on the receiving end of hate mail			0
' we will always take any steps necessary to enforce the @entity135 policy of zero tolerance in cases where the safety and well - being of our staff is under threat			0
