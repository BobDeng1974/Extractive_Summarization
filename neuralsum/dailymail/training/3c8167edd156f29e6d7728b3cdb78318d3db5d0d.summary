by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 17 april 2013 unemployment has increased by 70,000 to 2.56million , with another rise in the number of young people out of work taking the figure ' dangerously close ' to one million			1
the total is the worst since last summer , giving the @entity8 a jobless rate of 7.9 per cent , with 979,000 16 to 25 - year - olds seeking work			1
@entity12 , chief executive of @entity13 , said : ' youth unemployment is still dangerously close to a million			0
' thousands of these young people are long - term unemployed , often facing further challenges such as poverty and homelessness			2
we must act now to support these young people into work and give them the chance of a better future			2
' figures from the @entity24 show unemployment has increased by 70,000 to 2.56 million the number of people in work fell by 2,000 in the latest quarter to february , to just under 30million - the first time the figure has dipped since autumn 2011			1
today 's data from the @entity24 revealed that 900,000 people have been out of work for more than a year , an 8,000 increase on the three months to november , while the number of unemployed 16 to 24 - year - olds rose by 20,000			1
there was a 7,000 fall in @entity40 claimants last month , to 1.53 million			0
meanwhile , the rise in average earnings continued to lag behind inflation , with total pay increasing by just 0.8 per cent in the year to february , down by 0.4 per cent on the previous month			2
statisticians said it was the lowest growth rate since the end of 2009 , while the 1 per cent rise in regular pay , which excludes bonuses , was the lowest since records began in 2001			1
the number of people classed as economically inactive , including students , people on long - term sick leave or those who have given up looking for work , fell by 57,000 to 8.95 million			1
latest unemployment figures from the @entity24 show 7.9 per cent of the adult labour force can not find a job despite today 's increase in unemployment , the total is 71,000 lower than a year ago			1
there has been a 62,000 fall in the number of people in part - time jobs , to just over eight million , with a 60,000 increase in full - time employment , to 21.6 million			2
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity69 said : ' three years on it 's now clear the government 's plan is failing , and failing badly			0
not only are more people unemployed than at the election , it 's soaring up			0
' yet to add insult to injury this government is slashing tax credits and child benefit but giving millionaires a tax cut			0
families are £ 891 worse off because of tax and benefit changes and pay packets are now a whopping £ 1,700 smaller than at the last election			0
people have to work almost an extra month and a half to make what they did in 2010			2
working people are going backwards			0
' with the @entity96 warning @entity94 to change course and unemployment getting worse , it 's clear the time has come for a fresh approach			0
' figures show a rise of unemployment among young people and those out of work for more than a year @entity106 , chief economist at the @entity107 , said : ' the labour market figures are disappointing , but unsurprising			1
' despite the fairly large rise in unemployment , the number of those in jobs has remained almost unchanged			0
' the level of inactivity fell by 57,000 in the three months to february as more people returned to the workforce , and this contributed to the increase in unemployment			0
although the @entity8 labour market remains surprisingly robust , overall the outlook is uncertain			1
' it is realistic to expect further increases in the jobless total if the private sector is able to only absorb some of the expected reductions in public sector employment			2
in our recent forecast , we predicted that unemployment would increase to 2.6 million in 2014			0
' @entity132 , director of the @entity133 , said : ' today ’s data from the @entity24 show that the long - awaited recovery in the @entity8 labour market may still be some way off			1
' nearly all the headline indicators recorded little change ; the recent employment growth seems to have fizzled out , and there is virtually no change in total hours worked in the economy , or in new vacancies recorded by employers			0
' much recent commentary has focused on the apparent resilience of the @entity8 labour market , and the strong performance in total employment			2
' it ’s worth stressing though that the employment rate at 71 per cent is still below its pre-recession level , and the recent jobs growth has been at the expense of a poor productivity performance , which may harm the @entity8 ’s longer - term growth prospects			1
' recent employment growth has relied heavily on under - employed part - timers , and precarious self - employment			0
' looking beyond these small month - to - month movements in the official statistics , the overall picture remains one of stagnation			0
' unemployment has been stuck at around 2.5 million for nearly four years , a million higher than pre-recession levels , and the employment rate has been stuck in the 70 - 71 per cent range for a similar period			1
' the stark fact is that although the labour market was n’t hit as badly this time round as in previous recessions , it has taken much longer to recover , and the light at the end of the tunnel remains rather dim			1

data from the @entity24 reveals @entity8 has jobless rate of 7.9 per cent
900,000 people have been out of work for more than a year
experts warn figures show recovery is slower than expected
think - tank says : ' the light at the end of the tunnel remains rather dim '
