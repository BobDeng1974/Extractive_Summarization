by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:55 est , 6 december 2013 as the popularity of running grows , so does the number of running injuries and joint complaints , which has prompted a group of @entity10 scientists to create a shoe that can help improve a jogger 's technique			1
the innovative trainers - or ' smart shoes ' - warn runners if their feet are in the wrong position or if they are simply exhausted via a smartphone app. scientists from the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , @entity10 , said running novices and those with bad habits , risk twisting or injuring their ankle joints , pulling ligaments or even breaking bones when they are running on uneven ground or when they are tired			1
@entity10 scientists worked with five partners to develop a hi - tech running shoe with ' @entity35 ' sensors in the sole , which measure the biomechanical data of the athlete and evaluate the runner 's form with the help of measurements in real time if their muscles are not warmed up or a person overestimates their condition , training is often interrupted due to knee pain and pulled or torn muscles , the researchers warned			1
to combat these problems they worked with five partners to develop a hi - tech running shoe with ‘ @entity35 ’ sensors in the sole , which measure the biomechanical data of the athlete and evaluate the runner 's form with the help of measurements in real time			1
‘ pulse - rate watches and chest straps record only vital signs like breathing and heart rate			0
in contrast , our running shoe medically evaluates and monitors training while jogging , ' said dr @entity68 , a scientist at @entity22			1
‘ it informs the runner , for example , of incorrect foot position , asymmetric loading , or warns of exhaustion or overload			0
there has never been a comparable device before , ’ he added			0
scientists said running novices and those with bad habits , risk twisting or injuring their ankle joints when they are running on uneven ground			2
to combat the problem they developed their trainers that transmit running performance and recommendations to a runner 's smartphone a recent study found that men who turn to exercise in middle age may be damaging thier health			1
known as ' @entity98 - they exchange nights in front of the tv for frantic sessions on the treadmill in an attempt to get fit , lose weight and reduce the risk of a heart attack			0
however , an excessive , vigorous and unsupervised exercise routine might not be as healthy as it seems			0
emerging science suggests there is a threshold of distance , intensity or duration for even the hardiest fitness fanatic , and overshooting this can have a serious impact , particularly on cardiovascular health			0
a study presented at the @entity120 found middle - aged men who run marathons are at significantly greater risk of cardiac arrest			0
the system includes an rf module and batteries as well as accelerometers and gps systems that record biomechanical signals from the body and as the runner 's speed			1
this information is transmitted via @entity135 to the runner ’s smartphone			0
the researchers said an app evaluates the data in a split second using unique algorithms to give the runner feedback on their performance in real - time			2
if they are not performing as well as they might , it also makes suggestions about how they are running or their training pattern			0
dr @entity68 said : ‘ the app could recommend running more slowly , for example , or rolling off the foot differently , suggest seeking a different running surface or stopping if necessary			2
' the data collected from each run is transferred from the jogger ’s smartphone to a website for further processing and display so that a constantly - updated training programme can be created based on personal performance and goals			2
the scientists said their measurement system can be installed and removed from the soles of shoes and can be charged by placing the trainers on a charger that is included			0
a prototype of the running shoe and the smartphone app has been made but the researchers are now working on reducing the size of their sensors , which have to be light , waterproof and durable			1
they believe the smart sports shoe will be available to purchase in 2015 , although no price has yet been decided .			1

scientists from the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) developed the smart shoe to combat risks of ankle damage when running
the innovative trainers can warn runners if their feet are in the wrong position or if they are simply exhausted , via a smartphone app
they contain sensors in the sole , plus accelerometers and gps systems , which measure the biomechanical data of the athlete
' @entity199 ' will be available to purchase in 2015 , although no price has been decided
