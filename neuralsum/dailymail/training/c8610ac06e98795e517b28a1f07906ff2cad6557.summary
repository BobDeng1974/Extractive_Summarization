@entity0 may be nature 's most elegant hoppers , but their walk is anything but graceful			0
when foraging for food , these usually majestic creatures look ungainly and awkward as they attempt to balance their heavy bodies			1
but now researchers have discovered that appearances may be deceiving , and there cumbersome movements are in fact helped by a fifth ‘ limb ’ ; their tails			2
pictured is the tail skeletal structures with corresponding photo of a red kangaroo scientists from @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 in @entity20 discovered that a kangaroo ’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined			1
' we found that when a kangaroo is walking , it uses its tail just like a leg , ' said associate professor @entity39 of @entity40 in in @entity19 , @entity20			1
‘ they use it to support , propel and power their motion			2
in fact , they perform as much mechanical work with their tails as we do with one of our legs			2
' the researchers began the study thinking the tail was mainly used like a strut , a balancing pole , or a one - legged milking stool			2
red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in @entity60			2
when grazing on grass , they move both hind feet forward ' paired limb ' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies ' what we did n't expect to find was how much power the tails of the kangaroos were producing			1
it was pretty darn surprising , ’ said associate professor @entity75 at the @entity76			1

their legs work much like a rubber band			0
the males can leap over 30 ft ( 9 metres ) in one leap			0
this species is a very large kangaroo with long , pointed ears and a squared - off muzzle			0
the creatures primarily eat green vegetation , particularly fresh grass , which makes up 75 per cent to 95 per cent of their diet			0
when grazing on grass , they move both hind feet forward ' paired limb ' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies			1
a red kangaroo can increase its metabolism by 50 times during exercise			0
a kangaroo ’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined			1
the kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders to assert dominance			1

' they appear to be awkward and ungainly walkers when one watches them moseying around in their mobs looking for something to eat , ' said professor @entity75			1
' but it turns out it is not really that awkward , just weird			2
' in human movement , the back foot acts as the gas pedal and the front foot acts as a brake , which is not especially efficient , said professor @entity75			1
professor @entity39 said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg			1
‘ their tails have more than 20 vertebrae , taking on the role of our foot , calf , and thigh bones			0
' the research project had its beginnings in 1973 when a @entity142 professor @entity141 coaxed a small group of kangaroos to hop and walk on a large motorised treadmill , with a goal of measuring the energy costs of locomotion at varying speeds			0
this study showed that a kangaroo can increase its metabolism by 50 times during exercise			2
the kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders , then rear back and kick each other in the stomach in an attempt to assert dominance for the purpose of reproduction			1
professor @entity39 said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg			1
‘ their tails have more than 20 vertebrae , taking on the role of our foot , calf , and thigh bones , ' he said for the study the team videotaped five red kangaroos in @entity178 's @entity18 lab that had been trained to walk forward on a force - measuring platform with @entity181 sides			2
the platform 's sensors measured vertical , backward and forward forces from the legs and tails of the animals			2
the kangaroos had been taught that walking forward on the platform resulted in being rewarded with sweet treats			0
‘ this was a study we just could not let go of , ' said professor @entity75			1
' it was just too much fun			0
it 's a real wonder of nature , how these kangaroos move about and what they are able to do			0
' he likens the evolution of the kangaroo tail to a roll of duct tape in the back of a truck			1
' you know you are going to use it , you just do n't know when , ' he said			0
' i 'm envious of kangaroos , ' said professor @entity75 , a competitive master runner in the mile and 1,500 metres			1
' when they hop faster , they do n't use energy at a faster rate			0
the have the ability to move faster and not get tired , the ultimate goal of a runner			0

tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined
a kangaroo moves its tails as much as a human moves one of their legs
no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg , the study *claims*
it was *previously* thought tail was only used for balance and not power
