they beat their children with brooms , hoovers and wires and even gave their baby a morphine overdose just days after her first birthday			1
the plight of the children was so bad that @entity11 actress @entity10 , who met them at a church lunch , took them to the cinema ' because she felt sorry for them ' five of the children were finally rescued after their eldest daughter threw a heart - wrenching sos note out of a window			1
but it was n't until their one - year - old baby was given a morphine overdose over a year later that police reopened the case which led to their prosecution			1
the plight of the children was so bad that miss @entity10 , who met them at a church lunch , took them to the cinema ' because she felt sorry for them '			1
she gave evidence as a prosecution witness during the trial of the parents , both 40 , who can not be named to protect their six children			1
but the parents claimed they were victims of a conspiracy - and even alleged miss @entity10 was involved in a witch hunt against them and wanted to ‘ steal ’ their children			1
one of the youngsters , a baby at the time , had been allowed to stay in the home despite the fact the five other children had to be rescued			1

judge @entity62 said : ' no - one who sat through this trial could help but be moved by the fact that these intelligent , charming , fun , lovable children continue to love you despite what you put them through			2
' the married couple denied the allegations claiming they were victims of a racist witch - hunt but were found guilty of cruelty to a person under 16			2
they argued the children had been ' brainwashed ' into making the allegations by the police , the council and miss @entity10 who they said ' wanted to steal ' them , @entity83 heard			1
but judge @entity62 noted : ' you alleged a conspiracy involving a well - known actress , who had done nothing but show your family generosity and kindness , a member of a housing charity , social workers and foster carers			2
' those who had taken the trouble to support you were repeatedly accused of dishonesty , lying , and conspiracy to rob you of your children when the reality was that both of you were lying - in fact they ware simply seeking to give your children stability			2
' @entity109 , a @entity111 17 - month old boy who died after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight - month period the abuse came to the attention of police in april 2010 when their nine - year - old wrote an @entity120 note and threw it out of her bedroom window			1

she always leaves me out so i always starve and i am forced to work			0
' if i do n’t get enough house work done , i am beaten without mercy with the wooden end of a broom			2
i have scars all over me to prove it			0

i would like a new mum			0
' it was found by a neighbour who called the police , and when officers attended the address they found the children living in messy conditions with ' dirty ' and ' dishevelled ' clothing			2
revealing scars the eldest said her mother had hit her with a cable , a broom , and a hoover and her father had dangled her by her feet down the stairwell of the house , tied her hands behind her back and her legs together ' to get the devilish spirits out ' , prosecutor @entity143 said			0
her sister , who was seven at the time , had a stick shaped bruise of her thigh and after a few months in care , she drew a series of pictures showing her dad beating her and her being left home alone and including a speech bubble saying ‘ i ’m hungry			0
’ @entity168 , 8 , died in a @entity170 hospital in 2000 , having suffered months of horrific cruelty at the hands of her great - aunt the children were left home alone for hours , sometimes days on end , with the elder kids forced to look after the others			2
they had even been forced to lie to a charity and social services that they were living alone with their mother in one room and had no idea who their dad was so they could scam benefits			0
even during the trial the eldest feared she had torn her family apart with her ' devastating cry from the heart in the form of a letter which she threw from the window ' , the judge noted			0
there was an investigation but no further action , and the five children remained in care until the parents once again came to police attention on 28 june last year , when they gave their baby an overdose			1
' but for the events of june 28 you would have gotten away with your crimes because of a merciful decision not to prosecute you ' , judge @entity62 noted			0
