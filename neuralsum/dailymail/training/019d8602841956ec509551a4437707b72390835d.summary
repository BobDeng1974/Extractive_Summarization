the @entity20 clash was only his third appearance since december 2012 and the @entity32 will be hoping lightning has n't struck for a third time			0
one bit of good news for @entity39 's team was the return from injury of @entity4 - the winger came on to replace goalscorer @entity3 for the last 20 minutes			1
and it did n't take him long to make an impact on his return to the @entity46 , slipping the ball past @entity20 goalkeeper @entity48 from a tight angle to kill off any hopes they away side had of snatching a point			0
instant impact : @entity4 came off the bench to clinch the points for @entity5 injured : defender @entity17 is down with yet another injury substitution : @entity17 trudges past @entity39 as he is taken off on the head : @entity5 new boy @entity26 beats @entity59 in the air champions @entity5 started the season with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity64 after beating @entity65 2 - 1 on the opening weekend of the season			2
and they will now go into wednesday 's big @entity68 opener against @entity69 full of confidence but @entity20 are still seeking their first win of the season and stay third from bottom on a solitary point			2
eyes wide shut : @entity77 , on loan from @entity76 , challenges @entity3 in the air embrace : managers @entity39 and @entity80 share a joke before the game			0
