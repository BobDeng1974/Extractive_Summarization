by @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 18 july 2013 outgoing @entity2 chief executive sir @entity1 faces questions from mps again today after revelations about secret severance payments hospital bosses have spent more than £ 2million on 52 secret severance payments , igniting new controversy over the gagging of whistleblowers			1
the revelation will increase the pressure on outgoing @entity2 chief executive sir @entity1 , who had promised to investigate the problem			1
he remains in his £ 270,000 post until next year despite presiding over the @entity17 hospital scandal which cost the lives of 1,200 patients			0
in march , it emerged that @entity21 was paid £ 500,000 to go quietly under judicial mediation from his post as chief executive of @entity25			1
sir @entity1 told an influential commons committee this was ‘ a one - off ’ , but promised to look into the issue			1
asked if there were any other examples , he replied : ‘ it is the first time in my experience that i have ever seen that done			0
i have asked around and i do not think there is another example			0
’ however , figures uncovered by @entity40 mp @entity39 through @entity42 requests flatly contradict sir @entity1 ’s assertion			1
mr @entity39 has discovered that 32 hospitals spent more than £ 2million in 52 judicial payments to whistleblowers in the three years to march			1
six more hospitals have admitted making similar gagging payments , but refused to disclose the amounts			1
another 50 hospitals have not replied , which indicates the final figure is likely to be higher			2
two consultants at the @entity53 and @entity54 were paid £ 300,000 and £ 265,000 respectively			0
the payments were made in february – a month before sir @entity1 assured @entity4 the deal with mr @entity21 was an isolated case			1
the two consultants even worked for a hospital in the same county as mr @entity21			2
@entity61 paid £ 50,000 to a whistleblower in 2011/12 and £ 95,000 to another the following year			0
the @entity63 went through a mediation before paying £ 128,000 to four outgoing staff in 2010 ( although no gagging orders were made )			2
and @entity67 handed over £ 38,000			0
@entity21 , former chief executive of the @entity69 hospitals @entity2 trust , was paid £ 500,000 to go quietly today , sir @entity1 appears before mps on the @entity71 again to explain the apparent contradictions			1
mr @entity39 said : ‘ i find it hard to believe that this practice had been going on for so long and sir @entity1 knew nothing about it			1
he is the accounting officer for the @entity2 and so it is his duty to know how the money is spent			2
‘ after sir @entity1 gave evidence in march , i repeatedly asked his office about the progress of his investigation			1
‘ as no information was forthcoming i decided to find the information myself			0
‘ i was staggered that there had been so many secret payments to gag potential whistleblowers			2
i ’m even more staggered sir @entity1 apparently knew nothing			1
@entity92 from being one off , this is a systemic problem			0
‘ i ’m concerned these gagging payments are much more widespread			1
these new figures apply only to hospital trusts			0
‘ i suspect the ambulance , mental health service and community trusts will have used the same method			0
’ @entity61 paid a total of £ 145,000 to two whistleblowers @entity103 , chairman of the @entity4 ’ committee , will also be furious			0
the @entity105 , which is in her @entity107 constituency , made a secret payment of £ 28,000 earlier this year			2
the statistics have forced health minister @entity110 to change the rules			0
he said approval for judicial mediation payments will now be needed from the chancellor or health secretary			0
in april , @entity116 , which represents trusts on staff issues , said the payments must be ‘ exceptional ’ and have @entity121 approval			0
the six who refused to publish the costs of their gagging deals include @entity125 ’s and @entity126 ’s @entity25 , which is yards from the @entity128			0
in march , mr @entity39 found that in the three years to 2011 , there were 598 ‘ special severance payments ’ costing £ 14.7million in the @entity2 with strict confidentiality clauses			1
unlike the mediation payments , they were signed off by the @entity2 and @entity121			2
articles in june about secret severance payments to @entity2 staff said that two consultants at the @entity138 were paid ‘ hush money ’			1
we are happy to clarify that while the consultants in question were paid £ 300,000 and £ 265000 , they were not asked to sign gagging orders and continue to work for the trust .			0
