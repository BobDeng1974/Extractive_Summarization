by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 21 june 2013 a worldwide relaxation of the rules barring air passengers from using devices such as @entity5 , laptops and e-readers before a plane takes off came closer yesterday			2
aviation authorities in the @entity10 are to rule that travellers can keep such devices on during taxi , takeoff and landing because they are safer than had been thought			1
they found such gadgets do not interfere with navigation systems and that data used to draw up the ban was from the 1960s when such devices were very different			1
coming change : travellers in the @entity10 will soon be able to use electronic devices during taxi , takeoff and landing after research showed they do not interfere with the navigation system the decision will mean that on transatlantic flights , @entity31 passengers will be able to use their gadgets as they land on @entity10 soil			1
however , when they take off from @entity31 they will not be able to do so			0
the rules could change in @entity31 and across the world if the @entity10 research is shown to be credible			1
the @entity10 @entity39 will formally unveil its findings in september , it was reported yesterday			1
mobile phones will still have to be kept off but everything else will be approved for use even below 10,000ft , the current cutoff			2
phones are excluded because they were not part of the research , although the @entity39 is expected to look at this issue separately			0
overseas : the @entity10 lifting of the ban could spread to the @entity31 if the @entity10 research is shown to be credible the report will state that the original rules in the @entity10 were written in 1966 when it was thought that electromagnetic interference from computers and other devices could cause problems with navigation systems			1
nowadays passenger jets are ‘ much more tolerant ’ to such interference and the gadgets themselves are much safer			0
the report says this is because they use less power , transmit weaker signals and ‘ stay within a tighter range of frequencies ’			0
the @entity39 concludes that the ban has ‘ become untenable ’ because of the widespread use of consumer electronics			2
another factor has been the sheer number of passengers ignoring the rules			0
one survey found that , by accident or on purpose , a third of passengers had left their gadgets on when they should be turned off			0
the @entity31 ’s @entity80 said that it was monitoring the situation .			0

@entity10 travellers will be able to use electronic devices during takeoff and landing
@entity88 found the devices do not interfere with navigation systems
aviation authorities say the ban is no *longer* necessary below 10,000ft
