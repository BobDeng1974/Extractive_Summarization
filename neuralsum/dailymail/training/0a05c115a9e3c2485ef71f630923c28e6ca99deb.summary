there was controversy earlier this week when some travellers set up camp on a private golf course at @entity61 but organisers said they had worked to minimise antisocial behaviour - related problems			2
@entity64 , @entity65 ’s chief executive , said : ' a great deal of preparation has gone into the planning of this year ’s fair to help people enjoy the event safely			0
' this work includes pubs and off - licences signing up to a voluntary charter and having the street cleansing operation in place throughout the fair , so that the impact of this event on the local community is minimised as much as possible			0
' he added : ‘ there have been some issues at the start of the week , with some displacement of caravans in unforeseen circumstances			0
' traditional sight : skewbald horses graze on the @entity34 hills as children enjoyed the warm weather on the second day of the @entity3 travellers harness their carefully groomed horses and race up and down the ' mad mile ' to show off their animals , before bathing them in the @entity7 last year ’s event prompted a number of complaints after rubbish was left strewn across the town			1
there were also 20 people arrested on their way to the event on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm			0
in 1965 @entity108 attempted to shut down the event but were forced to back down after a huge outcry			0
