for the gold - medal olympians , their future post-games holds exciting prospects of tv interviews , book deals and lucrative endorsements			1
but what of those who made a less than glorious impact in @entity10 ? enter @entity12 distance runner @entity11 who was in fine form for a medal in the 1,500 - meter final last friday , when she was tripped from behind on the last lap and sent sprawling across the track			1
it was a memorable , if disappointing , exit which saw the distraught @entity19 pound her palms against the track in frustration before erupting into tears			1
taking a tumble : @entity11 of the @entity12 falls during the women 's 1500m final on day 14 of the @entity28 crashing down : @entity11 appeared to have had her heels clipped when she landed on the track and lost all hopes of a medal battling on : the other runners leap to avoid the @entity35 track star who was left sprawled on the ground in front of thousands of spectators following the race , @entity11 said : ' i still do n't know what happened			1
i 've heard a few different things from people , but ca n't say definitively what or who caused the fall			2
i remember running in @entity47 to try to avoid the crowding behind me			0
i was in a great position at the bell and was feeling great			0
' once i hit the ground , i was just devastated			0
' she was on her hands and knees , staring at the track in disbelief , when @entity57 of @entity58 won the race			1
for @entity11 , from @entity61 , @entity35 , this was another painful moment at a major competition			1
she also fell at the world championships last summer			0
after her race , @entity11 walked off the track with blood dripping from her leg and into the medical area			1
she left the stadium without talking to anyone			1
however if it 's any consolation to the runner , she was far from the only @entity75 athlete to make a disappointing exit from the @entity77			1
frustration : the runner pounds the track in rage after she crashed out of the race after years of hard work and commitment shattered : with bloodied knees from her fall , @entity11 leaves the track at the @entity77 after her disappointing exit defending olympic weightlifting champion @entity87 had a lucky escape earlier in the @entity77 when he dropped his 432 pound barbell onto his neck			1
losing his balance on his second lift of the competition , @entity93 could n't sustain the weights above his head during the snatch portion on the @entity100 awkwardly as the barbell landed on top of him , medical personnel rushed to his aid and hastily erected a shield around him while he was tended to			0
the crowd waited anxiously for any sign that the 29 - year - old had come through the dramatic accident and the @entity110 eventually staggered to his feet and waved to them before walking into the back room			2
he did not emerge for his third attempt and an announcer told the crowd that the 2008 @entity75 champion was being taken to a hospital for a precautionary x-ray on his neck			0
painful exit : @entity110 weightlifter @entity87 loses his balance as the 432lb barbell lands on his neck on august 7 agony : the defending world champion grimaces in pain as the weight lands on him - he forfeited his title at @entity28 @entity12 made the men 's 4x400 meter relay final at the @entity75 despite the fact that runner @entity130 broke his leg half way round the track			1
the 25 - year - old athlete took the first leg of @entity12 's heat and although he finished with a limp there was no obvious sign of the pain he was feeling			2
he said afterwards : ' i got out pretty slow , but i picked it up and when i got to the 100 - metre mark it felt weird			2
as soon as i took the first step past the 200 - meter mark , i felt it break			1
' i even put out a little war cry , but the crowd was so loud you could n't hear it			0
i knew if i finished strong we could still get it ( the baton ) around			0
i saw @entity156 motioning me in for me to hand it off to him , which lifted me			0
keep on running : @entity75 relay runner @entity130 broke his leg in the middle of the men 's 4x400 race ... but just kept going to pass the baton through the pain barrier : @entity130 runs towards @entity12 teammate @entity156 during the men 's relay heats shortly after breaking his leg ' i did n't want to let those three guys down , or the team down , so i just ran on it			2
' @entity130 's decision to go through the pain barrier allowed his @entity12 team mates to sprint to a joint finish with the @entity175 in identical times of 2 minutes 58.87 seconds , the fastest ever run in the first round of the relay at the @entity75			0
and not every diving performance was a show of grace and athleticism either			0
@entity110 's @entity183 attempted a somersault , but lost the grip on one leg which saw him spin out of control and land flat on the water flat on his back with a huge thud on august 7			0
precarious : @entity110 's @entity183 teeters on the edge of the springboard during the men 's three - meter dive preliminary round but loses his balance ... ... before landing with a splash in the swimming pool to loud gasps from the crowd ( and a lot of zeroes from the judges ) he climbed out of the pool apparently unhurt after huge gasps from the crowd during the men 's three - meter springboard , but received zeroes from all the judges			1
there was also devastation for @entity211 's hurdling hopeful @entity212 after he hit the first obstacle in the 110 - metre event			2
@entity212 limped out at the starting line in front of his home crowd four years ago in @entity218 with an @entity220 problem and fell hard at the first obstacle in the race this year			0
@entity212 , who had been one of the gold medal favorites , crashed into the first hurdle , aggravating an already weakened @entity220 , and was eliminated from the race			0
the qualifying round of the men 's pole vault took a dramatic turn when @entity231 's @entity230 saw his pole snap in mid-flight			0
thankfully , the athlete did not appear hurt after the incident - which was replayed many times for tv audiences			2
hitting the deck : @entity211 hurdler @entity212 , left , and @entity240 's @entity239 were early fallers in the men 's 110m hurdles on tuesday carnage : @entity212 , @entity246 's @entity245 , @entity248 ' @entity247 ( second right ) and @entity250 's @entity249 ( far right ) all failed to finish the hurdling race unlucky break : @entity230 of @entity231 's pole snaps as he competes in the men 's pole vault qualifier on day 12 of the @entity77 even champs have their down days : @entity258 's @entity257 falls off the beam during the artistic gymnastics women 's @entity261 final on day 11 of the @entity77			1
