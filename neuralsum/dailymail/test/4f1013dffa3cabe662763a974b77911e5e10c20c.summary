boss @entity0 backed @entity2 to fire @entity3 to safety after the striker 's crucial hat - trick saved a point against @entity8			1
the forward 's treble - his first in two years - clinched a pulsating 3 - 3 draw with their drop rivals as @entity3 edged further clear of the bottom three			1
@entity3 are three points above the @entity17 drop zone and denied @entity8 the chance to leapfrog them in the table			1
@entity2 scored a stunning hat - trick as @entity3 drew 3 - 3 against @entity8 manager @entity0 said that @entity2 can fire @entity3 to @entity17 safety defeat would have left @entity3 in the relegation zone and behind @entity8 but @entity2 struck a 25 - yard free - kick with seven minutes left to save them and complete his treble			1
the @entity27 international has seven goals in seven games under @entity0 and the boss hopes he can maintain his form to keep @entity3 up			1
he said : ' that 's the plan			2
' it does n't come much better than that			0
he 's a good player , i have always said it and he 's in a rich vein of form			2
' it 's fantastic for him to score the goals , it 's just a shame we could n't get the three points			2
' it 's not about what you deserve , it 's about what you get and we got one point			2
' this could be a vital point come the end of the season in the end , when you go so late into the game and @entity58 has had to pull that out the bag we 're grateful			0
' but @entity0 insisted @entity3 should have won after @entity2 's first - half double , cancelling out @entity63 ' opener , gave them a 2 - 1 lead at the break			1
he said : ' it 's disappointing when you dominate a football match like that , the ref should have stopped it at half - time			1
@entity8 were only ahead for three minutes in the first half after @entity2 equalised for the hosts at @entity75 @entity2 drove beyond @entity76 from the edge of the box to net his seventh goal of the season early on ' i thought we tired in the second half but that 's to be expected and two of those back four have trained about four times in eight weeks			1
we dropped off a little bit too deep and could n't keep that pressure on them			0
' but anyone who has seen that football match knows it should n't have been close			0
' @entity8 hit back after the break through @entity94 and @entity95 , the latter netting with just 12 minutes left			1
they have taken four points from their last two away games after winning just once on the road this season before saturday 's 4 - 1 win at @entity102			1
the draw , though , left them two points from safety having played a game more and boss @entity108 admitted he was nervous after @entity95 's goal			2
he said : ' it 's a long time , it 's heart attack time for managers that			0
you can see you 're going to win but you know there 's a chance anything can happen , a free - kick , a corner or a bit of magic			2
@entity2 's added two more , including this wonder free - kick - much like @entity123 's on monday night ' i thought we could ( hang on ) but a free - kick is a free - kick , at that stage most of their attacking options had been exhausted			1
' i 'm disappointed if i 'm being honest			0
but before the game if someone said we 'd get four points from the last two games we probably would have taken that			0
' @entity8 were seeking back - to - back away wins in the top flight for the first time since 1995 but @entity108 targeted home victories to keep them up			1
they host @entity137 on sunday before welcoming @entity138 and @entity139 to @entity140			0
he said : ' i do n't know what we need but we 're probably going to have to win three games			0
i do n't know what the points total will be but our two home games are going to be very important after @entity137			0
' we have got a couple of very difficult ones in @entity150 and @entity151 and then we have the potential cup final against @entity153 on the last day of the season			0
' most teams would take being in it right to the end and then roll the dice , you do n't want to start being detached because it 's a big mountain to climb			0

@entity2 netted all three as @entity3 drew 3 - 3 against @entity8
the @entity163 can fire @entity3 to @entity17 safety
that 's the view of @entity0 , who *lauded* his main striker
