by @entity0 a collection of brightly coloured lights streaking across @entity4 's southern skies have been impressing sky watchers in @entity6 in recent months			1
the ' @entity7 ' can also be seen from @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 usually between march and september			0
it is the @entity12 's equivalent to the @entity13			1
the mesmerising display of light - filled patterns , known as the @entity7 , is the result of a combination of natural forces occurring some 100km above the earth 's surface			2
the streaks of greens , purples , reds and yellows are formed inside the @entity26			0
this is where electrons emanating from the sun and gases in the upper atmosphere collide			1
the collisions produce electrical discharges which energise atoms of oxygen and nitrogen , causing the release of the multicoloured light seen in these pictures			0
each colour is representative of a particular distance from the earth 's surface , and the reason why @entity46 are so best placed to view the spectacular light show is because of the state 's location to the @entity51 's @entity50			0
the best place to see an aurora is away from major urban light sources , on a clear , moonless night , when the @entity55 is clearly visible			0
there is no particular time frame of when auroras occur , however the phenomenon could be as frequent as once a month over the next two to three years as the sun cycle reaches its 12 year peak auroras usually last several hours , and are best viewed on clear and cold nights and can bee seen most prominently from polar latitudes the average height of an @entity7 event is between 50 to 100km above the earth and the most common colours are pale green and pink			1
the most common shapes are spiral curtains , arcs , or streamers the best place to see an @entity7 is in southern @entity8 , @entity6 , @entity10 and @entity9 during periods of high activity , a single auroral storm can produce one trillion watts of electricity with a current of one million amps the global distribution of auroral activity is an oval around the magnetic poles in both hemispheres			2
the other major light phenomenon is the @entity87 which occurs in the @entity88 to see the lights at their best you need to get clear of city lights and have a good view to the south			1
the best time to see them is an hour or two either side of midnight			0
the light displays begin as a red glow on the horizon and can rise up to 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon , taking on a more familiar green colour like @entity6 in the south , the best places to watch the @entity13 ( in @entity103 ) are in the northwestern parts of @entity105 , particularly the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
@entity110 is the best place to view the lights because of its position in relation to magnetic south the @entity7 is caused by plasma particles from the sun ( part of the solar wind ) , which enter the atmosphere and collide with electrically charged particles			2

the @entity7 or ' @entity7 ' is best seen in parts of @entity6 on a clear and cold night 's sky
it is the @entity12 's *version* of the @entity87 or ' @entity13 ' best seen in @entity103
the phenomenon occurs when electrons emanating from the sun and gases in the upper atmosphere collide
the result is this illuminating spectrum of green , purple , yellow and red lights streaking across the sky
