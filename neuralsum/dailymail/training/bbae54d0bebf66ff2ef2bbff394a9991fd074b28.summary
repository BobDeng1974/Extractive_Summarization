statins have virtually no side effects , a major study shows			1
scientists found that patients taking the cholesterol - busting drugs were less likely to suffer adverse symptoms than a control group taking a placebo			1
for years , statins have been linked to numerous side effects including nausea , insomnia , fatigue , kidney issues , muscle problems and even erectile dysfunction			1
statins : draft @entity18 guidelines will advise men over 50 and women over 60 to take the drugs as a precaution but researchers at @entity24 , who looked at 29 trials with more than 80,000 patients , found the drug raised only the risk of diabetes			1
draft @entity18 guidelines will advise men over 50 and women over 60 to take the drugs as a precaution			1
this could see the number of people taking statins – currently around seven million – rise to 12 million			0
the research , published in the @entity38 of @entity39 , shows that only a small amount of the reported symptoms are attributable to statins			0
@entity42 , of the heart and lung institute at @entity24 , said : ‘ most people in the general population will not feel perfectly well in every way on every day			0
more than a million prescriptions for statins – dubbed a miracle drug – are written each week in @entity50 , up from a few thousand in 1981			0
the drugs reduce cholesterol , the waxy fat - like substance which can build up in the arteries , raising the risk of heart disease and stroke			1
they work by blocking an enzyme involved in the production of ‘ bad ’ cholesterol , especially in the liver			0
studies suggest statins may also protect against health problems such as eye disorders and @entity68 ’s by maintaining a healthy supply of blood to the brain			2
the most serious side effect was previously thought to be myopathy , resulting in muscle pain			2
others include cataracts , headaches , loss of appetite and nerve pain			0
for years , a medical debate has raged over the risks and benefits of statins			0
some have questioned their benefits for women , as fewer women have taken part in drug trials			1
‘ why should they suddenly feel well when taking a tablet after being warned of possible adverse affects			0
‘ we believe that patients should be empowered to make their own decisions , but we must first make sure they have top quality unbiased information			2
this is why we call on drug regulators to highlight in the long list of side effects those few whose rate is incrementally greater than that experienced with a dummy tablet			1
’ however , some sections of the medical community still believe it is wrong to dismiss side effects of statins , because many patients under - report them in clinical trials			1
@entity113 , a cardiology specialist , told the @entity115 : ‘ to suggest that these symptoms are imagined is an insult to patients who have suffered , many for months , from side effects that are real and increasingly appreciated by frontline doctors			1
’ earlier this month doctors recommended @entity118 should be taking more statins to decrease their chances of heart attacks and strokes			0
they used to prescribe only to those who had a 30 per cent or greater risk of suffering a heart attack within a decade			0
this was lowered to a 20 per cent risk in 2005 , but now medics could be handing pills to those with just a 10 per cent risk			2
even patients aged 80 and over are likely to get them despite little evidence they will benefit			0
the new rules would make at least ten million patients eligible for anti-cholesterol drugs , securing @entity118 ’s place as the statins capital of @entity139			2
@entity140 says the draft guidance will make clear that doctors should first work with patients to help put them less at risk , such as stopping smoking , drinking less , taking exercise and eating healthily			1
high intensity statin therapy , with a drug such as atorvastatin , should be offered to patients once these factors have been addressed .			0

*overview* of 29 studies found the drugs raised only the risk of diabetes
draft @entity18 guidelines will recommend all men and women over 60 take them
but some medics say patients may be under - reporting side effects in trials
