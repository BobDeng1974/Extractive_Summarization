one in three rioters who brought terror and destruction to the streets of @entity5 went on to commit crimes including murder , rape and robbery , figures revealed yesterday			1
some 1,593 of the 3,914 thugs charged or cautioned following the disturbances of august 2011 have reoffended			1
among the near - 6,000 fresh crimes they notched up in the three years since the riots were 12 killings , 180 serious assaults such as wounding and 151 crimes involving a weapon			2
the offences include murder , rape , @entity29 , drug charges and theft trouble : rioters plunged much of @entity33 into chaos over in august 2011 , looting shops and torching buildings but although some rioters are still in jail for offences committed during the lawlessness , the vast majority have either been freed or given non-custodial sentences			1
the statistics sparked fresh calls for the authorities to get a better ‘ grip ’ on young men entrenched in a life of violent crime and warnings that failing to keep career criminals under control is putting people in danger			2
the figures are also likely to be echoed in other cities struck by rioting that spread from the capital , including @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			2
a breakdown of figures released under the @entity64 reveal a total of 5,878 new crimes committed by the @entity5 rioters			1
of these , 1,172 were violent offences – including 314 ‘ assault with injury ’ crimes , 171 common assaults and 265 cases of harassment			2
along with 21 rapes , there were also 719 burglaries , 451 robberies and 1,075 thefts			0
some 1,819 drug offences included 221 trafficking charges , and there were 36 frauds and 213 cases of vandalism			0
incredibly , one rioter went on to commit 72 new crimes			0
the data also reveals how 168 of the 1,593 reoffenders in @entity5 belonged to gangs			1
some 107 people – 17 of them gangsters – committed ten or more new offences			2
@entity95 and online messaging are creating a generation of youngsters who are ‘ kinder ’ and less likely to commit crime , @entity94 has claimed			0
the @entity5 mayor said concerns that smartphones and handheld games consoles were turning children into ‘ lidless lizards ’ could be ‘ more or less entirely dismissed ’			1
he argued that gadgets gave the young ‘ endless opportunities ’ for self - expression and communication that kept them from being ‘ sucked into crime ’			0
in a speech on technology in @entity113 during a whirlwind tour of the @entity115 , mr @entity94 said : ‘ i would say that on the whole the younger generation are nicer , kinder , more well - balanced and more emotionally literate than my lot ever were			0
’ he said while young men are typically drawn into crime because of ‘ anger , low self - esteem and a sense of social exclusion ’ , selfies , texts and shared videos provided by handheld gizmos offer ‘ myriad pipette drops of self - affirmation ’			0
he referred to technology as a ‘ liberator ’ that gives voters the right to vent their feelings every day , adding : ‘ i see no evidence whatever that tech is coarsening or depraving the young people of today			0
’ a total of 261 rioters , including 49 gang members , carried out between five and ten more crimes			1
@entity5 ’s deputy mayor @entity142 , said urgent changes were needed to protect the public by keeping a better ‘ grip ’ on offenders			1
he called for @entity148 - style reforms that would put @entity149 in overall control of the capital ’s entire criminal justice system			1
he said the figures proved that the riots in 2011 were fuelled by ‘ prolific offenders rather than low - level opportunists ’			1
‘ even though the police have learnt the lessons of the riots , the wider criminal justice system needs to up its game and stop playing pass the parcel with these violent criminals , ’ he warned			1
‘ we need to grip these offenders			0
many have not been deterred , despite prosecuting them more quickly in 2011 , and have gone on to rape and murder in some cases			2
’ the @entity23 said it is working hard to reduce reoffending , but the responsibility for monitoring freed criminals fell mainly to other agencies			0
rioters plunged much of @entity33 into chaos over several days in august 2011 , looting shops , torching buildings and terrorising neighbourhoods			0
the unrest began in the capital and was sparked by the killing of @entity181 , who was shot dead by police in @entity184 , north @entity5 , on august 4			1
however , the rioting quickly spread to other parts of @entity5 and @entity33 , with @entity60 , @entity59 and @entity61 all hit by ' copycat violence ' over the subsequent days			2
a @entity189 spokesman said : 're - offending has been too high for too long and we are introducing wide - reaching reforms to the way offenders are managed to tackle this unacceptable issue			0
' this year , for the first time , all prisoners will receive at least 12 months rehabilitation on release to tackle their criminal behaviour			0
' this includes those on short sentences who have the highest re-offending rates and up until now have received no statutory post-prison support			0
' this will be vital in cutting crime and making our communities safer			0
' the figures , released by @entity211 , show that the offences were committed between the aftermath of the riots and the end of last year			1
the re-offenders included 168 gang members , the police figures revealed			1

of the 3,914 people charged over @entity5 riots , 1,593 have now re-offended
the offences include murder , rape , theft , robbery , @entity29 , drugs and assault
of the 1,593 re-offenders , 168 were gang members - police figures show
