by @entity0 stunning shots of these cliff - top cottages in @entity3 show the frightening pace of the coastal erosion now gobbling up @entity7 's coastline			1
a photograph taken just over a century ago shows a terrace of seven houses set well back from the sea with a stretch of land in between			0
but pictures from this week show all of the land between the homes and shore has now disappeared into the sea - with just two houses left hanging in the balance			1
the houses were built for coastguards ibetween 1800 and 1820 and allowed their occupants an unrivaled view of the @entity47			0
the photo taken around 1905 shows all seven properties within a large walled garden built with a brick shed on the perimeter			0
in that photo , many metres of cliff - top land lies between the garden 's walls and the cliff edge , with a beach beyond			2
but one hundred years of storms have since battered the coastline , cutting away huge chunks of the cliff - top land			0
demolition crews have since removed many of the ex-coastguard homes and destroyed the latest terraced property this week			2
gone : the cottage is not being allowed to fall away naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach - goers demolition : the local council says more than three metres of cliff has been lost in the past four months due to the severe winter weather going : authorities in the area have been fighting a running battle with the sea as they attempt to demolish properties in @entity24 , @entity3 before they fall over the cliff edge after some of the cottages had to be demolished in 1994 and more in the early 2000s , a cherry picker was used this week to remove the walls of the latest property , with what is left of the house expected to have disappeared by the end of the week			1
@entity88 have said that at least three metres of cliff has been lost along the seafront of @entity24 in the past four months - which represents about seven years ' worth of erosion at the usual rate			1
experts say it is not possible to allow the cottage to fall away into the sea naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach - goers below			1
a huge crack in the land has opened just yards from the cottages in recent week and the steps below which lead to the beach have also been closed off following collapses			0
just last week , two sightseers were pictured standing close to the edge of the cliffs causing @entity112 spokesman @entity111 to warn people to steer clear of the crumbling chalk			0
@entity115 - which is responsible for the stretch of coastline - says winter storms have caused the kind of damage they had not expecting for years to come			1
the trust - which owns more than 740 miles of coastline around @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , around a tenth of the total coastline for the three countries - has previously warned that with more extreme weather predicted , the rate of change on @entity7 's coastline will speed up .			2

photos from @entity24 , near @entity38 , @entity3 show how the sea is cutting its way through terraced homes
a house which had four other properties between it and the sea in 1905 is now left hanging over the beach below
authorities , who are demolishing the homes to lessen the danger to beach - goers , removed another home this week
severe winter storms have *increased* the rapid erosion - with three metres of coast lost in the last four months
cliffs in the area have eroded at a rate of *0.7metres* a year , but experts warn the speed of change is now *increasing*
