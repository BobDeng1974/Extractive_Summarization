by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 01:33 est , 3 june 2013 women who live in fear of breast cancer coming back may be able to beat the disease by taking a drug for ten years after surgery , say doctors			1
using tamoxifen for ten rather than five years halves the risk of women dying from the most common kind of breast cancer , according to a study – described as a ' pivotal moment ' in the fight against the disease			1
the study looked at the benefits for women with tumours fuelled by the female hormone oestrogen – who account for three out of four patients – and found those taking tamoxifen for longer than the recommended five years are better protected against recurrence and are less likely to die from the disease			1
benefits : taking tamoxifen for ten years after surgery halves the risk of the most common kind of breast cancer dr @entity30 , of @entity31 , said : ' these findings are extremely exciting			1
@entity33 is a well - established and cheap treatment			0
' the @entity36 trial involved almost 7,000 women with breast cancer who , after five years of taking tamoxifen , either continued taking the drug for another five years or stopped treatment			1
among women who took tamoxifen for ten years , 25 per cent fewer had recurrences of breast cancer and 23 per cent fewer died , compared to those who took the drug for just five years			1
the research was presented yesterday at the @entity49 conference in @entity50			1
dr @entity51 , clinical lead researcher based at the @entity53 , said : ' these results are important as they establish that giving tamoxifen for longer than the current standard of five years significantly cuts the risk of breast cancer returning			2
' doctors are now likely to recommend continuing tamoxifen for an extra five years and this will result in many fewer breast cancer recurrences and breast cancer deaths worldwide			1
@entity33 is cheap and widely available so this could have an immediate impact			0
' the @entity36 trial involved almost 7,000 women with breast cancer who , after five years of taking tamoxifen ( pictured ) , either continued taking the drug for another five years or stopped treatment despite its benefits , tamoxifen does have side effects , including some similar to menopausal symptoms , such as night sweats and hot flushes			1
rare but serious side effects include increased risk of endometrial cancer – cancer of the lining of the womb – blood clots , and stroke			0
professor @entity83 , based at the @entity84 and presenting the findings in @entity50 , said : ' this study establishes that the benefits of taking tamoxifen for longer greatly outweigh the risks			2
' side effects : although tamoxifen helps with breast cancer prevention , it can create symptoms similar to the menopause cancer specialist professor @entity95 was involved in the first trials on tamoxifen three decades ago			2
he said : ' this trial is very encouraging news for women			0
my group was the first to report the benefits of tamoxifen in 1983 ' it 's wonderful that 30 years later , we have the proof that the benefits last even longer than we could have anticipated			0
' professor @entity95 added that doctors were likely to offer the drug to more women after they had completed a five - year course of treatment after surgery – because many were asking for it			0
he said : ' they are often very reluctant to come off it after five years			0
' it becomes a psychological crutch that has helped them through a very difficult time , and now we have the evidence to say with confidence that if they want to continue , there are definite advantages			0
' @entity128 , of @entity129 , said : ' these findings herald a pivotal moment for one of the key weapons in the fight against breast cancer			1
' we are delighted that this drug , one of the most significant in the history of breast cancer treatment , can have an even greater effect in preventing it from returning if women take it for longer			2
' the @entity50 conference also heard that @entity146 researchers have discovered that a handful of so - called ' superfoods ' can help fight prostate cancer			2
a six - month trial involving 203 men with prostate cancer found that prostate - specific antigen ( @entity154 ) levels of those who took a capsule containing essence of pomegranate , green tea , turmeric and broccoli were 63 per cent lower than those who did not			0
@entity154 is a level of the protein produced by the prostate gland which is an indicator of prostate cancer			0
professor @entity168 , a consultant oncologist at @entity170 and @entity171 hospitals , said : ' we hope this will help millions of men to help combat the onset of prostate cancer			0

@entity33 can stop types of breast cancer fuelled by oestrogen recurring
doctors now likely to recommend taking the drug for an extra five years
the @entity36 trial involved almost 7,000 women
@entity188 presented yesterday at conference of specialists in @entity50
this is described as a ' pivotal moment ' in the fight against the disease
