thousands of coasting schools across the country have fallen foul of a tougher inspection regime , figures out today show			1
in a crackdown on mediocrity , the schools watchdog @entity7 is ordering them to improve			1
the move follows the introduction of hard - hitting inspections to rout out poor performance			1
tougher times : thousands of @entity14 schools have been ordered to improve or face action by @entity16 in a major speech today , @entity7 ’s chief inspector , sir @entity17 , will praise schools that strive to raise standards			1
but he will warn that those only doing the minimum to get by will have to raise their game or face severe sanctions			2
since september 2012 , all schools have been required to achieve at least a ‘ good ’ rating			1
before then , schools were rated as outstanding , good , satisfactory or inadequate			1
however , the satisfactory rating was scrapped and replaced by ‘ requires improvement ’ to highlight continuing weaknesses			1
schools are now rated on the four - point scale of outstanding , good , requires improvement and inadequate			2
changes : in september , the satisfactory rating was scrapped and replaced by ' requires improvement ' to highlight continuing weaknesses in schools @entity7 figures released today will reveal that more than 7,000 state schools in @entity40 were inspected between september 1 , 2012 , and june 30 this year			1
of these , almost a third – around 2,000 – fall into the ‘ requires improvement ’ category			0
they will be inspected more regularly , with @entity7 monitoring progress and checking action plans , and will be subject to a full re-inspection within two years			0
schools judged to require improvement at three consecutive inspections are likely to be placed in special measures , which means they face the sacking of the head and other staff , the replacement of the governors and even the closure of the school			2
schools judged ‘ satisfactory ’ before september last year did not automatically fall into the ‘ requires improvement ’ category , but they are expected to improve before their next inspection			1
the changed ratings also mean that to be judged ‘ outstanding ’ , a school must have outstanding teaching			0
in addition , they face inspections at short notice , with the head only being notified at lunchtime the day before			0
extra checks : schools rated as ¿ requires improvement ¿ will be inspected more regularly and monitored by @entity7 speaking in @entity71 , sir @entity17 will insist that the overhaul is leading to improved standards across the country , with more schools moving into the ‘ good ’ category after rising to the challenge			1
the former head teacher will be addressing an audience of outstanding head teachers and urging them to share their expertise			0
he is expected to reiterate his view that the new inspection regime is having a ‘ galvanising effect ’ on head teachers and making them prioritise improvements			0
earlier this year , he said : ‘ heads and governing boards have a much greater focus on tackling the central issues of school improvement			0
’ professor @entity92 , director of the @entity93 , said yesterday : ‘ prior to the new category , we ’d actually been fooling ourselves about how well our schools were doing			2
‘ we were marking them as satisfactory whereas this new category shows a lot of them were n’t satisfactory at all but needing improvement			2
@entity7 has raised the bar , so – rightly – it ’s expecting more of schools			2
it ’s giving us a clearer picture of how well schools are doing			0
‘ it ’s bringing things which need to be addressed to our attention			0
’ @entity107 , a former head teacher and chairman of the @entity109 , added : ‘ it ’s right there should be a more rigorous inspection as we obviously want the best for the children			0
‘ for too long , schools have been prepared to accept a satisfactory grading as a green light to coast			1
’ @entity7 has already introduced a tougher framework to stop weak head teachers bumping up their overall ratings by concentrating on areas such as pupil wellbeing , spiritual development and community cohesion			0
since last january , schools have been judged on four key areas – teaching , pupil results , behaviour and leadership .			0

@entity16 orders ' mediocre ' schools to improve performance
