two large red bellied black snakes were captured intertwined on video
the snakes are believed to be in the ' corkscrew position '
this can be an act of aggression over females or just to show *dominance*
red bellied black snakes are quite a docile species of snake
they are very common in @entity7 and usually will not bite
the advice is to step back and not engage
if you live in a bush area , *protect* your pets by cleaning the yard
