the @entity30 mp said : ‘ there are now going to be legal consequences for her			0
what i will say is that i checked her documents - i took them from her			0
‘ you can draw your own conclusions from this but her status did not reflect the documents that i saw			2
‘ there was a reason i did n’t really mention it in my letter - i was being careful because obviously i do n’t want to impact the case that will deal with her			0
‘ obviously it was tempting to include everything in the letter but we did n’t want to do anything to prejudice our ability to deal with it			0
’ yesterday a senior cabinet minister insisted mr @entity0 had not broken the law but was holding himself to a ‘ very high standard ’			1
officials said mr @entity0 had not broken the law because she was self - employed and so not hired directly by him			1
but an immigration lawyer suggested mr @entity0 could still be in line for a £ 5,000 fine because he failed to keep copies of the documents shown to him by his cleaner			1
barrister @entity68 , writing on the @entity71 blog said mr @entity0 ‘ may well in fact have broken the law ’			1
his failure to ‘ take and retain copies of certain documents ’ could be a breach of the @entity77 1996			1

communities secretary @entity114 told @entity116 ’s @entity115 he was ‘ really sad to see @entity0 go			2
’ ‘ had he been a member of the public , i do n’t think he would have done anything wrong			2
but he set himself a very high standard and he failed that standard and , therefore , honourably , stood down			0
’ ‘ the new legislation is reasonably light - touch			2
if this had been a member of the public they would have done nothing wrong			0
’ yesterday critics seized on the issue to suggest it exposed flaws in the government ’s immigration crackdown			0
@entity134 said it should also prompt a rethink about the effectiveness of proposed new rules for landlords , employers , bankers and others to verify the status of foreign workers			0
@entity145 immigration minister @entity144 said : ‘ as immigration minister he has argued in @entity148 for landlords to be required to carry out checks on every tenant , and he is responsible for the helpline for employers to ring up to double - check the immigration status of their employees			0
‘ we have called for the landlord scheme to be piloted , and the employer helpline to be better resourced exactly because this can be complex for employers and landlords			0
’ ‘ he has shown himself to be a decent man in his resignation and i wish him well for the future but perhaps once again the government need to think very carefully about how they approach this issue as it ’s clear there are limits to the effectiveness of relying on employer and landlord checks to address illegal immigration			0
