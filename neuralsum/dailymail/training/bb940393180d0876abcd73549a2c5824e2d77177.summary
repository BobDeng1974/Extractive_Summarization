she never minced words ... it was her trademark			0
and at the height of the miners ’ strike the stage was set for @entity7 ’s hardest - hitting speech yet			1
for the @entity10 conference in 1984 , her writers had drafted a damning critique of @entity13 ’s unwillingness to condemn picket - line violence during the bitter year - long conflict , thuggery she described as a ‘ dark shadow ’ over our free country			1
but before she could deliver the strident words , a more sinister shadow fell			0
the papers featuring her original speech have now been released by the @entity35 the never - seen - before papers from the former prime minister 's personal file in 1984 show her first attempts at writing her @entity10 speech her original speech accuses the @entity13 leadership of sympathising with militant miners and trade unionists and sanctioning their breaking of the law @entity46 of the @entity47 said it would have been a ‘ great ’ speech and more controversial than her ‘ enemy within ’ address to the @entity51 of @entity52 in july 1984 on the day she was due to address colleagues at the @entity56 , her hotel , the @entity31 , was hit by an @entity30 bomb			1
five @entity10 colleagues were killed and others seriously injured			2
as the nation reeled at such an attack on the heart of @entity64 , the prime minister famously insisted on continuing with the party conference agenda , but with a radically revised speech to declare @entity68 ’s defiance in the face of terror			1
now the original text , which historians believe would have eclipsed her address branding miners the ‘ enemy within ’ a few months earlier – has been revealed in her personal papers from 1984 , which are held at @entity76 , @entity77 and released today by the @entity35			1
it accuses the @entity13 leadership of sympathising with militant miners and trade unionists and sanctioning their breaking the law			2
she was set to accuse the party 's leader @entity82 of being ' a puppet ' of the militants - unprepared to face them down			1
it reads : ‘ from this dark cloud falls an acid rain that eats into liberty			0
it can be seen above all in the natural home that these views and voices now find in the @entity13			2
‘ it explains why that party is so muted in its condemnation of picket violence ; so muted in its praise for the hard - pressed police ; so muted in its advocacy of an @entity100 [ @entity100 ] ballot			1
’ the draft of mrs @entity7 's address was written following the previous week 's @entity13 conference , which had been dominated by the miners ' strike			1
the then prime minister intended to accuse mr @entity82 of vainly trying to convince his party that it should try to win power ' through the ballot box , not through insurrection '			1
she was to add : ' mr @entity82 ’s own words … show just how far the enemies of democracy have advanced inside the modern @entity13			2
mr @entity82 , for all his words – and there is no shortage of those – has been hijacked , first by mr @entity118 , then by the anti-democrats at his own party conference			0
in name he may be leader			0
in reality he is a puppet			0
' a first draft of the speech the former prime minister was going to give at the @entity10 party conference reveals how she planned to attack @entity13 and the miners ' strike @entity7 's torn up notes of the speech she intended to give on the day of the @entity32 bombing have been released by the @entity35 the original handwritten notes reveal how she was planning to launch an attack on @entity13 but she changed her speech after the @entity30 bombing of the @entity31 the prime minister had just survived an assassination attempt and was grieving for colleagues who were not so lucky			1
but while battling to hold together a party and a nation in shock , mrs @entity7 also remembered to cancel a hair appointment			2
after briefing her secretary to let local stylist @entity145 know she would not be coming , she wrote to him herself to thank him for his work on her hair earlier in the week			0
‘ the fact that it lasted so well through friday [ when the bomb hit ] was the real test , ’ she told mr @entity145			0
her private secretary @entity151 later wrote to @entity7 , saying : ‘ we shall remember not the bomb or the ruined building but your courage , calm and nobility in the aftermath			0
’ in the aftermath of the @entity30 bombing in @entity32 , @entity7 still managed to remember to call her stylist and cancel an upcoming hair appointment in newly - released letters from @entity164 , the former prime minister wrote to her stylist , mr @entity145 , apologising that she had to cancel in the wake of the tragedy the conference came just months after the @entity169 in @entity170 , on june 18 , when thousands of police and striking miners clashed			1
dozens on both sides were injured			0
mrs @entity7 ’s speech describes the @entity13 as being ‘ infiltrated by extremists , riven with factions ’ , adding : ‘ we meet today as free people in a free country			1
' but every one of us here senses the shadow that has fallen across this freedom since last we met			0
‘ the shadow i speak of is the violence and intimidation which has scarred and wrecked the coal industry , and particularly the working miners and their families			0
‘ the shadow grows darker as influential men and women in our society question , even repudiate , the ideas of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law			0
’ the speech was torn into sections and later taped back together – possibly by the @entity199 herself			0
in her 1984 conservative party conference speech ( above ) , @entity7 instead chose to condemn the @entity30 and declare @entity68 's defiance in the face of terror the @entity31 in @entity32 was hit by an @entity30 bomb in october 1984 in an attempt to kill @entity7 and her @entity207			1
it killed five people and injured a further 30 @entity7 's suite at the @entity31 in @entity32 , after the @entity30 @entity32 bombing			1
debris lies at the foot of mrs @entity7 's bed , the sheets pulled back in readiness for her to retire for the night			2
the dramatic pictures of the prime minister 's suite show how close the @entity30 came to succeeding in its assassination attempt @entity7 escaped the bombing without injury but five people were killed in the early morning attack in october 1984 , including a cabinet minister 's wife in her original speech party conference , @entity7 was going to blast @entity13 and the miners ' strike			1
pictured : the picket line at @entity231 , near @entity232 , @entity233 @entity118 , leader of the @entity100 , being arrested on the picket line at @entity235 , @entity170 in 1984 during the miners ' strike she narrowly avoided death in the @entity30 attack , as the blast hit her bathroom			1
following the bombing in the early hours , she toned down her script			0
the resulting words , spoken just hours later , were much more conciliatory and she paid tribute to those killed			0
@entity46 of the @entity47 said it would have been a ‘ great ’ speech and more controversial than her ‘ enemy within ’ address to the @entity51 of @entity52 in july 1984			2
the original text shows she was prepared to go further and launch an all - out offensive on @entity13			2
mr @entity46 said : ‘ she would have taken some convincing to deliver such an attack on @entity13 and only done so with extreme provocation as such partisan politics were against her nature … [ it ] would have defined her career			2
’ @entity7 and her husband @entity262 ( pictured together in the immediate aftermath of the bombing ) were lucky to escape uninjured after bomb hit the hotel room @entity267 was staying with his wife @entity268 in the @entity31 when it was bombed by the @entity30 in 1984			1
his wife was left disabled by the attack ( together in 1987 ) @entity7 pictured with her husband @entity262 on stage at conservative party conference in @entity32 following the @entity30 bombing of the @entity31 in 1984 @entity7 once faced a diplomatic row about roses			1
the incident , which saw the @entity68 mediate between @entity278 and @entity279 over who could name a rose after her , stretches for more than 40 pages in her 1984 files			2
the @entity10 leader was asked by the @entity278 @entity285 if it could name a flower in her honour			0
she said she was ‘ deeply touched ’ , adding in a nod to her party ’s colours : ‘ a blue rose would be too much to expect			0
’ but she had forgotten that in 1978 she gave permission for a @entity7 rose to be created by @entity279 firm @entity293			0
after a series of memos , it was eventually decided the @entity279 should be appeased			0
@entity278 and @entity279 once bickered over who could name a rose after the former prime minister			1
the incident stretches for more than 40 pages in @entity7 's 1984 files			1
