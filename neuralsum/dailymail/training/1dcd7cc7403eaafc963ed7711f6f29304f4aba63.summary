it 's those flyaway hemlines worn on windy airport runways @entity9 should be most concerned about			2
now the @entity10 of @entity12 's favourite dressmaker , @entity13 's @entity11 - the woman behind the infamously feather - light yellow frock that almost cost the elder @entity16 sister her modesty at @entity18 - has revealed she 'll be weighting down the royal hemline from now on			1
@entity9 wore a specially designed @entity11 primrose yellow shift dress during her tour of @entity23 , and had a slight wardrobe malfunction on the windy runway at @entity18			1
' i had a little handwritten letter from a lady in @entity30 passionately criticising me for the primrose yellow shift dress i made for the duchess , ' @entity11 , who was born in @entity26 , told @entity13 's @entity33			1
' she said did n't i know about putting weights around the bottom of a hem so it ca n't blow up ? ' well , i did n't know it was going to be worn on a windy runway - but i did think maybe in future i will put in more weighting , just in case ... ' @entity10 suffered a similar sartorial slip - up on the runway at @entity45 as she and her husband @entity46 were returning home from their @entity49 tour of the @entity50 and @entity51			2
this time she was wearing not a @entity53 creation but a floral dress by @entity55 , the label of @entity57 and @entity58			2
@entity59 takes tailored measures to ensure her skirt always knows its place			0
perhaps @entity9 would benefit from the sage advice of her grandmother - in - law			2
@entity59 herself is reported to be a fan of having tiny lead weights sewn into the hemlines of her skirts and dresses to save her from embarrassment of this type			0
the monarch also ensures all her dresses and skirts are made made with underskirts of a tighter circumference than normal			0
that way there is no chance of them lifting above knee - height			0
similarly , to stop her getting too warm when she is on official business , the @entity59 insists on loose clothing			0
all her clothes are made of natural fibres , and @entity88 , her personal assistant and curator of the royal wardrobe , ensures that a duplicate for every outfit is close to hand			0
if something is spilled on her clothes or there is any other mishap , her majesty can discreetly change into a new set without anyone knowing			0
no item of the @entity59 's wardrobe is sent to a dry cleaner — all clothes are hand - washed , steamed and pressed by one of her three dressers to avoid any unpleasant chemical smells			1
@entity9 wore @entity11 's duck - egg blue pleated dress in @entity110 , left , and @entity111 , right , during the @entity49 tour			1
back in @entity13 , @entity53 's flagship boutique is on the site of a former bank in @entity116			1
indeed , the private dressing room - where clients such as the @entity9 and @entity120 actresses including @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 are presented with their bespoke clothes - is a windowless room inside a former vault			1
the place is full of scented candles , flowers and zebra - print furniture			0

@entity53 - who also designed the emerald green floor - length dress the @entity10 wore to the @entity137 concert at the @entity138 , two of the dresses she wore on her recent jubilee tour in @entity111 , and a pale grey floral summer dress worn in @entity143 last year - does not sell the designs she has made for the young royal			2
each and every one of them are bespoke , designed for @entity9 alone			0
' we 're not @entity148 , ' said @entity11 , who admits she is not high fashion and does n't ' feel the need to be quirky or avant garde '			2
still , business has gone up by 40 per cent in the past 18 months thank to the ' duchess effect '			0
and anyone who does wish to buy one of @entity53 's non-bespoke , off - the - rack creations must be prepared to part with anything from £ 2,000 to £ 3,000			1
