@entity1 footage from a ' haunted ' @entity3 pub captures the moment staff say a ghost pushed a bottle of cordial off the bar			1
a series of strange incidents have been reported at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 - where barmaids and cleaners claim a ghost pinches their bottoms			1
staff at the pub now believe they have surveillance footage which proves the ghoul 's existence			1
the video shows a bottle of blackcurrant cordial mysteriously moving across a surface and falling on the ground			1
mr @entity34 , a builder from @entity39 who was staying in the pub at the time , said : ' it was very freaky			2
we could n't understand how on earth the bottle toppled over the bar like that			1
' the eerie incident happened when barmaid @entity49 had momentarily left the bar to go to the basement			1
ms @entity49 , 24 , says : ' i went down to the cellar to get some more spirits and suddenly i heard a big bang from upstairs			0
' i immediately rushed back to the bar to see @entity34 and @entity35 leaning over staring at the bottle on the floor			1
' they told me what happened and i was spooked			0
' the @entity62 , @entity63 , initially refused to believe @entity34 's and @entity35 's explanation			2
landlord @entity65 , 24 , say the incident is not the first strange event to have happened at the pub barmaid @entity49 was present when the bottle smashed and says she has experienced the ghost herself mr @entity63 , 24 , said : ' when i came to the bar and saw the blackcurrant cordial on the floor , i was furious			1
' i thought @entity34 and @entity35 had been messing around and dropped the bottle on purpose			2
we were really busy that night			0
i did n't appreciate them fooling around like this			0
' but @entity34 and @entity35 kept swearing that it was n't them and begged me to check out the @entity1 footage			2
' i actually made a Â£ 20 bet that they had pushed the bottle themselves as a prank			2
but when i saw the recording , i could n't believe it			0
i tried to explain it away			0
' i thought maybe @entity34 and @entity35 had used some string to push the bottle but there 's no rational explanation for what happens in that video			1
' there have been several ghosts sightings reported at @entity10 , which dates from 1368			0
barmaid miss @entity49 and another female staff member claim that they have had their bottoms pinched by the ghost			1
staff have even quit their jobs at the historic pub - which @entity106 reportedly stayed in - because of fears about ghosts			1
the pub dates back to the 14th century and is near the site of @entity111 in the @entity112 bar staff say they thought drinkers were pulling their legs when they first heard of the incident , but now say they are convinced it was the work of the ghost mr @entity63 added : ' two years ago , our long - serving chef came in one morning and saw a ghostly figure of a lady walk straight through a door			1
' he was so scared afterwards that he locked himself in the disabled toilet until the other staff arrived			0
a day later , he quit the job for good even though he 'd been really happy at @entity10			1
' to be honest , we usually try to detach ourselves from our ghostly reputation because it makes it hard to find employees who are willing to work here			0
' @entity131 do n't usually stay long here because they become terrified of the place when they 're locking up at night			0
' mr @entity63 has hired psychic mediums in a bid to put an end to the ghostly sightings			0
' we 've had several mediums come to @entity10			0
the @entity139 during the @entity112 , was fought just outside the pub so they reckon that 's why we have so many ghosts here			2
' a few mediums have talked about a drunken ghost called @entity146 - who we think is responsible for pinching bottoms and smashing bottles			2
' the psychics also mentioned a ghostly woman whose baby fell down the well that we have in @entity10			0
apparently , she wanders around longing for her lost child			0
