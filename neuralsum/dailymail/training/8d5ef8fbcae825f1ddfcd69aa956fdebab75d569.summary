a spokesman for the adventure centre told @entity65 that it had ' an unblemished record ' for child protection in the 38 years it had been run as a family business			0
' considering the special needs nature of the school , our on - site instructor was looking for a lead from the two female members of the teaching staff who were present throughout this incident , ' he added			1

she said the school , in @entity106 , had ' for some considerable time now been experiencing many difficulties ... most of which are a legacy of past events '			2
