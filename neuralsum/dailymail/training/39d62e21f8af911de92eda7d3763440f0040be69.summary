@entity0 started weaving loom bands to make colourful bracelets for herself and her daughter , but soon wanted a larger challenge one mother has got her holiday swimwear sorted - after making a bikini out of loom bands			1
@entity9 , 25 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , spent months making the colourful two - piece from the little plastic rings			0
the mother - of - one started making little bracelets for herself and her daughter , @entity16 , two , but soon decided to try something more challenging			2
she said : ' i have always been quite arty and enjoyed making things			0
' i was doing it for a little bit , but was n't really massively into it			0
' i thought it would be fun to make a bikini out of them , but i did n't think it could be done			2
' then i saw that someone had made a dress out of them , and i decided to give it a go			1
' i made it completely from scratch and it took weeks - and three separate attempts before i cracked it ! ' a lot of people said i must have a lot of patience to do it , it was very fiddly			0
' now @entity0 hopes she 'll be able to sell the two - piece , and donate some of the money to charity			1
' i would give some money to @entity46 in memory of my grandfather , @entity48			0
' she said she has since made a crop top for her daughter , but said she was too young yet to have a go at making the loom bands herself			1
the trend for clothing made out of out the simple children 's toy began to grow after one women placed a dress made of the plastic bands on @entity62 for over a hundred thousand pounds			1
however unfortunately the dress did not sell for that amount as the buyer pulled out			2
but that has n't stopped more wannabe weavers being eager to follow suit and try to make a quick buck from their rubber band creations , with the online auction site being inundated with clothing and accessories made from the bright bands			2
a quick search reveals endless listings with some items having a price tag of more than £ 5,000			2
fashion fans have crafted everything from bikinis to belts and even high - heeled shoes from the rainbow - coloured elastic bands			0
going loomy : lots of loom band enthusiasts are listing their fashion creations on online auction site @entity62 the first ever man 's ' loomkini ' also recently went up for sale on the site on sale at starting price of £ 30			1
the listing of a ' thong made from the popular bands ' was originally taken down as the image broke @entity62 's nudity laws			1
even flip - flops and high heels created from the colourful bands are beginning to appear on @entity62 the shoes are n't created entirely out of the bands but instead heels are decorated using the weave jumping on the band wagon : @entity66 , 42 , put her dress , made entirely from loom bands by her friend @entity121 , on @entity62 and it reached £ 170,000 - since then the auction site has been inundated with loom band creations for some of the weavers their creations are more than just a hobby			1
one listing advertised a bodycon boob - tube style dress being sold to raise funds for a big day			0
the dress was designed by @entity134 26 , from @entity135 in @entity136 , who enlisted her family to help make the dress which took them a grand total of 39 hours to create			0
too much skin : @entity144 's original advertisement showed more of his figure than @entity62 allows ( right ) but his item has since been relisted and the 22 - year - old is currently fetching bids over £ 50 @entity134 is hoping that her efforts will pay for her wedding to partner @entity151			1
according to @entity153 newspaper @entity134 was hoping to have enough to set aside a little extra to help buy her brother a car to thank him for helping with the dress			0
' it was my brother 's idea to make such a fashionable dress , and he helped me decide on the particular style we ended up with after we had discussed it			0
i have n't seen anything on the internet like it			0
' @entity134 is hoping that her complicated design might fetch enough to cover the cost of her wedding ... not to mention a car for her brother pick of the crop : this revealing crop top is one of the many inventive designs currently listed on the site ' i just thought that if the other lady could do it , then so can i. there 's a huge craze going on at the moment with these bands , so i gave it a go ' continued the hopeful bride - to - be			0
however it appears that the increasing availability of loom band clothing is seeing the value of the garments decrease			1
11 - year - old @entity190 from @entity191 , @entity192 , spent seven days crafting a loom band dress from 25,000 of the elastic bands			1
a family affair : @entity190 will spend her £ 45 profit on a fish and chip dinner with her folks on their next holiday @entity190 used £ 90 worth of the bands and saw her dress go under the hammer for just £ 155			1
however the school girl seemed unscathed and thanked her family for the support			0
' my family have been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £ 90 to make this dress and have supported me all the way			2
' unlike @entity134 , @entity190 has much more humble plans for her loom band profit			1
she said she wanted to raise at least £ 50 cash so she could give her four - year - old brother @entity214 £ 10 , keep £ 20 for her to spend in the arcades and £ 20 for a fish and chip dinner treat while on holiday in @entity218 , @entity219 , next month			2
getting creative : one weaver created a belt using the bands daring design : the dresses now listed on the site have become increasingly intricate to compete with the many available			0
