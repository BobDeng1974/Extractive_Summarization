' heeere 's @entity0 ! ' nope			0
it 's actually @entity2 and @entity3			1
the @entity4 have been living together at the @entity5 in @entity6 since october and taking care of the property during its off - season			1
although they do n't have a son named @entity12 , the @entity4 are aware some are comparing their situation to that of @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19 's @entity20			1
@entity2 and @entity3 have been living happily at the @entity5 in @entity6 since october @entity2 is a caretaker at the hotel and they will be there maintaining it all winter until the spring thaw in april given how isolated the hotel is ( pictured left ) and how cut off the @entity4 are from the rest of the world , many have compared their situation to the one in the film @entity20 ( pictured right ) many @entity31 , which is located on the eastern edge of @entity31 , welcomes hundreds of thousands of guests each summer before it closes down for the year in september			1
now the vacation hotspot has only two visitors : @entity3 and @entity2			1
an employee of the hotel since 2008 , @entity2 does maintenance work on the 76 - acre , 100 - year - old property			1
this is the first winter he or @entity3 have stayed at the hotel to watch over it until things thaw out in the spring			1
they will be battling snow , rain , wind , and occasional four - legged houseguests until april			2
the @entity4 have seen fewer than ten people during their stay at @entity52 and so isolated the only emergency vehicle that would be able to reach them is a snowplow , @entity49 reported			1
in order to keep their friends , loved ones and past guests in the loop about what has been happening at the @entity64 - alpine style hotel , @entity2 and @entity3 post updates on their a winter at many @entity52 blog			1
they use the blog to post pictures , weather updates and information about the ' day to day life of the caretaker at the very remote @entity5 in @entity31 '			2
fewer than ten people have seen the @entity4 , but they provide updates via the winter at many @entity52 blog this is the first winter @entity2 ( pictured right ) has stayed at the hotel to maintain it during the cold and snow the lobby of the hotel ( left ) looks reminiscent of a main room in the fictional @entity84 ( right ) so far the ' all work and no play ' lifestyle at the hotel has n't caused either one of them to have a homicidal episode similar to @entity91 's in @entity20			1
fortunately for the @entity4 and the hotel 's insurer , things sound peacefully dull at @entity52			2
the @entity4 have not had a ' @entity0 ' moment at the hotel and hopefully they wo n't @entity2 said : ' we watched @entity20 up here just because of that and there are a lot of parallels			1
' our hotel is n't heated and we do n't live inside of it			0
but as far as the long hallways , that 's similar			0
' there 's also stocking up for food in the winter , which we have to do ourselves			0
' and then of course the snow			0
' even though there is n't a gigantic hedge maze on the property , there is a direct connection between @entity52 and the fictional @entity84 featured in the film			2
@entity19 filmed a scene for the movie , which is set in @entity121 , on @entity31 's @entity123 , the @entity122 reported			1
however , the @entity52 only has 214 rooms , so the creepy @entity125 that @entity12 is warned to stay out of because it has a ' shine ' in the film does not exist			2
despite the isolation , the @entity4 do n't sound as if they are looking forward to the spring			0
@entity2 said : ' actually , the winter is going by too fast			2
' we wish we had another six months of this			0
' we love the valley anyway and i could live here year round			0
' but the winter is a nice opportunity to catch up on maintenance so in the spring it 's not such a push			0
' it 's like a tradition being passed along			0
' when you 're up here , you kind of take ownership of the place			0
' the property of @entity52 does not contain a hedge maze , but it does border lakes and mountains many @entity31 does have a bar ( left ) but it does n't come stocked with a ghostly bartender ... or @entity16 ( right ) many @entity31 welcomes hundreds of thousands of guests each summer before it closes down for the year the @entity20 ( pictured ) was written by @entity18 and filmmaker @entity19 directed the movie in their latest post , the @entity4 wrote : ' for the last four days it has been raining and we 've seen a lot of our snow melt away			1
' this is the second warm spell we 've had this winter			0
' it 's amazing how much snow has disappeared , do n't get me wrong we still have a lot of huge drifts around , but there have been more bare spots showing up lately			0
' from what we 've been told this kind of weather is normal even in the middle of winter and that the big snow months are still ahead			0

@entity2 and @entity3 are living at the @entity5 in @entity6
they have been at the property for months and seen fewer than ten people
@entity52 in @entity31 has thousands of guests in summer
@entity19 filmed a scene of 1980 *horror* *classic* @entity20 at park
