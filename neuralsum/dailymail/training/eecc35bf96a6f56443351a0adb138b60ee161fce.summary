by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 already has the support of four of the six @entity4 confederations to stand for a fifth term as president next year , by which time he will be 79			1
the leaders of @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , and @entity12 are understood to have pledged their backing last month			1
the verbal endorsement took place at the presidents ’ meeting before the last @entity19 summit ahead of the @entity20 draw in @entity21			1
five alive : @entity1 looks set for a fifth term as @entity4 president after getting the support of four of the six confederations lacking fizz : @entity26 has admitted he stands no chance if @entity1 stands again for the @entity4 presidency and @entity30 federation president @entity29 went a step further by confirming his organisation ’s championing of @entity1 in a letter to the @entity4 overlord			2
no wonder former @entity4 executive @entity26 , who launched his fanciful bid for the presidency in @entity37 this week , admits he has no chance if @entity1 stands again			2
@entity1 has said he will make up his mind before this summer ’s @entity20			1
but as long as he remains in good health , only massive opposition from daughter @entity43 or his new girlfriend @entity44 is likely to deter him			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity46 's reclusive owner @entity45 , who has appointed herself chairman after the departure of @entity49 , is said to have little or no football knowledge			2
but she can at least take advice from two neighbours in her home village of @entity54 on @entity55 who do know their sport — @entity58 and @entity59			1
there is still no publication date in sight for the most long - awaited football autobiography — @entity65 ’s life story , which his wife @entity66 started writing more than 16 years ago			1
after well over a decade of concerns about legal problems , the book — now being ghost - written by @entity72 football correspondent @entity71 — was said to have been almost finished last january			0
but a year on , the final chapter dealing with @entity65 ’s sale of @entity75 to @entity76 has not been completed and the 82 - year - old is on holiday in @entity9			1
still waiting : former @entity75 owner @entity65 ' autobiography does not have a publication date as of yet the @entity81 , who have a lot more than a lunatic fringe among their 18,000 - strong membership , are facing a third call in three months for a debate to discuss governance and the botched lord ’s renovation process			1
however , it does n’t help the rebels ’ credibility when ringleader and self - publicist @entity94 , who had spent months campaigning for the last @entity96 , then went on holiday rather than attend the meeting			0
it 's good to know the @entity101 protocol committee busy themselves with some of the great football issues of the day			1
the latest minutes show that the blazers have been complaining about the sweet course in their @entity108 meal being served at half - time rather than before the match because of time pressure before kick - off			2
these ridiculous councillors have even asked for visiting international delegations to be reminded about the collar - and - tie dress code for their fancy function			0
sweet row : the @entity101 protocol committee have been complaining about their dessert being served in their @entity121 , seen here , vip suite at half - time rather than before the match this follows @entity129 @entity101 representatives turning up for the @entity20 qualifier at @entity121 in jeans and sweatshirts			1
some of the blazers are also aghast that their summer junket is now scheduled for every other year rather than being an annual event			0
@entity138 grey @entity101 board duo @entity137 and @entity139 are being blamed for cutting down on the partying			2
@entity142 's judgment has to be called into question when sports agent @entity144 , whose clients include @entity146 and @entity147 , receives a call from the inept tv station asking if the late @entity150 would be available for interview on tuesday			0
the @entity153 bid document for the @entity154 said there would be around 120 people working for the local organising committee by the start of the tournament			0
however , er 2015 now expect around 300 to be on the payroll in the build - up — with no doubt plenty of appointments coming from the ranks of @entity166 , who already dominate the rugby team			0
@entity160 2015 say 300 staff is in line with the numbers from @entity172 in 2011 and @entity173 2007 .			0

@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 and @entity12 back @entity1
@entity1 received verbal endorsement ahead of @entity20 draw in @entity21
@entity65 autobiography still has no publication date after more than 16 years
@entity46 owner @entity181 has @entity58 and @entity59 as neighbours
@entity101 protocol committee complain about time sweet is served on match days
