by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 did not make a mistake on tuesday in keeping faith with @entity5			1
neither did they make a mistake by backing every player bar @entity10 who let them down so badly at @entity12			1
but they did mess up in taking so long to let the public know their third test plans			2
there was never any question of @entity5 jumping or being pushed , but in waiting until gone 3.30pm to announce a 13 - man squad for the @entity22 on sunday , the selectors allowed speculation to run wild			0
@entity5 was going to be sacked , it was said			0
@entity5 was going to stay as captain but he was going to be rested for the rest of the season , it was suggested			0
@entity5 wanted to quit but was talked out of it , was another rumour doing the rounds			0
his future was not even on the agenda when @entity38 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 met and decided , as expected , to bring in @entity51 for @entity10 and retain those others who threw the @entity53 away			1
the bottom line is that @entity5 has three tests to save his captaincy and he accepts he will have to go if he can not regain his form at @entity58 , @entity59 or the @entity60 and @entity2 lose this series			1
for what it ’s worth , i absolutely agree with that , even though i appear to be in an increasing minority with some very credible sources now saying that time should be called on @entity5 , for his own sake as much as @entity2 ’s			1
@entity71 and @entity72 are two of the most respected voices in cricket — to be honest , they should be running the @entity76 game but administration ’s loss is the media ’s gain — and when they speak i usually listen			0
but even though those former @entity2 captains have said that @entity5 should go , i believe he has earned the right to try to do what he did in @entity35 two years ago and overturn a 1 - 0 deficit to win a test series			1
@entity5 has been badly let down by his senior players , those who @entity2 hoped would not only create the right culture and environment for young players to thrive , but would also set the right example with their performances			2
cooky crumbles pressure : @entity5 is under significant scrutiny as @entity2 captain instead , @entity96 , such a key figure , is in almost as bad form as @entity5 , prior has been forced to concede defeat in his battle against the ravages of time and @entity102 and @entity103 had the perfect chance to win the second test on the first day but under - performed when conditions were made for them			1
@entity5 is said to be in more defiant mood than in @entity109 , when he considered packing it all in after the @entity111 one - day international			0
he believes there were signs at @entity12 of his form coming back , he is getting on well with @entity38 and is learning to compartmentalise after becoming a father			0
those clamouring for his head should remember that we are talking about one of @entity2 ’s best - ever batsmen and a captain good enough to win that series in @entity35 and the @entity124 last summer , before @entity2 ’s world came tumbling down			1
most important of all , he is a decent man who commands respect			0
that @entity2 collapse has been spectacularly rapid and another pillar of the side which went to no 1 in the world has gone now that prior has admitted he is not fit enough to continue			1
coming in : @entity51 has been called in to replace the injured @entity10 poor form : @entity96 has been struggling nearly as badly as @entity5 with the bat the keeper - batsman has been integral to @entity2 ’s successes and has been a selfless , positive presence in the team			1
we should wish him well while appreciating that some senior players must remain			0
the form and fitness of another of those senior men — @entity103 — was a much bigger issue for the selectors yesterday and it would be no surprise if he was told to rest his damaged knee at the @entity22			0
@entity2 may have picked a virtually unchanged squad — @entity150 was only ever at @entity12 as part of his rehabilitation — but @entity153 understands they will make three changes , @entity155 and @entity156 almost certainly coming in as well as the gifted @entity51 , perhaps for @entity103 and @entity157			1
@entity157 is in a horror batting run but is a big part of @entity2 ’s future			2
his presence in the squad shows they want to carry on working with him and the other young players who have created such a good impression this year			0
issues at the crease : and his batting form has suffered badly as well in recent times dip : he is without a century now in 27 innings , and is averaging just 14 this year for that is the paradox			0
every new face introduced by @entity2 has done well to a degree and they will be joined in @entity58 by the hugely talented @entity51 , who has done so well in limited - overs cricket			1
@entity51 , the most inventive of batsmen , is far from the finished article with the gloves and may make mistakes , as @entity10 did when he emerged in 2007			1
patience , a virtue in understandably short supply after a run of seven defeats in 10 winless tests , may be needed with him			2
the seniors do not deserve as much patience and there were some harsh words in the @entity2 dressing room on monday night			2
there will be more from the coaches on friday when @entity2 convene again in this non-stop series with the need for more heart , passion and desire emphasised by @entity38 and @entity201			2
it was never going to be easy this year after a 5 - 0 humiliation in the @entity124 , but it is proving far tougher than anyone involved with @entity2 ever imagined			2
what @entity5 , @entity38 and @entity205 need to do more than ever is hold their nerve			0
the signs yesterday were that they are doing just that .			0

it was *n't* a mistake for @entity2 to keep faith with captain cook
@entity2 name just one change to side for third test against @entity35
@entity51 comes in to replace injured @entity10 at *wicketkeeper*
failed to win a @entity53 in last 10 matches , including seven defeats
