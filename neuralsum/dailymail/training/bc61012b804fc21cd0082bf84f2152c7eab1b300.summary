by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 12:03 est , 21 february 2013 a new recruit to the @entity2 has been dubbed ' @entity3 ' - because he 's a 14 stone pig			1
@entity6 the pig has been recruited by fire chiefs to help fire fighters train how to handle escaped animals			1
the 200lb pig has already helped train dozens of fire fighters how to save escaped animals , and soon , almost every fire fighter in @entity13 will have had ' escapology lessons ' with @entity6			1
but it was n't long before the 18 - month - old piglet - who is still growing - became known at the sanctuary for his friendly , but cheeky nature			2
and after several escape attempts , his carers realised he would be the perfect candidate to teach fire fighters how to handle escaped animals without startling or harming them			1
cheeky : @entity6 weighs 200lb - the equivalent of 14 stone - and can prove to be quite a handful fire officers are regularly trained at the centre by expert staff , but over the last six months , trainers have introduced a practical element into the training - herding @entity6 safely around the farm			1
but the cheeky pig makes sure the task is not as easy as it sounds - and after a day of chasing hefty @entity6 around a muddy sty , the crews are more than well - equipped to deal with runaway farm animals			1
animal safety lecturer @entity65 , who runs the course , said : ' @entity6 is a very friendly animal , he loves human attention and likes to be the centre of attention			0
' however , he also loves to run off exploring whenever he can , so he was the ideal candidate to help train these fire crews			0
' a lot of the fire fighters have never had any contact with animals before , and have no idea how to handle them , or read their body language			0
' they told us that rescuing stuck or trapped animals , or catching escaped animals who have made their way onto roads , is a major part of their job , and the animal training is a big help for them			0
' the course with @entity6 lasts a day , and they start in the classroom , before progressing out to the stables to deal with @entity98 face - to - face			2
' they usually start the day not - to - keen on the pig - but by the end of the training , he 's everyone 's best friend			2
it 's impossible not to love him			0
' on the run : @entity6 the pig keeps fire fighters busy during a practice drill at the animal rescue centre @entity37 in @entity39 learning new skills : fire fighters from @entity13 attend the rescue centre to learn how to deal with escaped farm animals firefighters use blankets and boards to help create a walkway for the escaped animal - but as they quickly discover , not all animals want to go quietly - and @entity6 regularly escapes from the walkway , leaving fire fighters to catch him once again			1
@entity37 worker @entity122 said : ' @entity6 is great for helping fire fighters realise how difficult it can be to control animals , but hopefully , they leave the training with a better understanding of animals and how to handle them			0
' @entity6 loves the attention and his new role - he gets a lot of fuss and attention			0
' on the trot : fire fighters use large wooden planks to heard @entity6 where they want him to go full of surprises : @entity6 has proven the perfect candidate to teach the fire fighters how hard it can be to control farm animals			0

the 200lb - 14 stone - pig was taken to a rescue centre after his owner died
after several escapes staff realised he could be handy for firefighters
@entity36 pig now teaching them how to deal with animals on the loose
