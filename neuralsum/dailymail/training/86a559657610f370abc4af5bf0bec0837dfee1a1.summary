by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money will be spent on a new political class of government officials under plans by cabinet ministers			0
the @entity8 says the employment of dozens of politically appointed civil servants – chosen by ministers and not other civil servants – is vital to ‘ put a rocket ’ under @entity1 and make sure they implement manifesto reforms			1
but critics say the plans will see the upper echelons of the civil service being stuffed with cronies and ‘ mates ’ on salaries of up to £ 84,000 each			1
reality : the move to give ministers bigger personal teams of advisers is designed to counter the control of the civil service , described in sitcom yes minister as the ' opposition in residence ' @entity33 was forced to defend the plans in the @entity35 yesterday after being accused by a @entity37 backbencher of bringing in an unpopular style of administration from the @entity40			1
cabinet office minister @entity41 argues elected politicians need more support to deliver on their promises in @entity46 , civil servants are traditionally appointed by other civil servants , seen as a more independent system than the politicised @entity40 system			1
ministers can currently hire a small number of political appointees known as special advisers or ‘ spads ’			0
over the last year , the amount spent on these has jumped by 16 per cent , despite @entity57 ’s pre-election pledge to ‘ bring down the cost of politics ’			0
the £ 7.2million total cost is now more than it was under @entity61			0
but the @entity8 announced in july that it wanted to allow ministers to extend their private offices with the employment of more staff taken on by them and not other civil servants			1
this will mean millions more will be spent on politically - appointed staff			0
and , unlike spads , these officials will be able to instruct other civil servants			1
there will be no limit on the number of people in an extended office , but insiders played down the idea of ministers hiring ten or more aides			1
they will have to find the money from within existing budgets			0
ministers have become increasingly frustrated with obstruction from @entity1 mandarins , which they say has led to an unacceptably slow pace of reform			0
they say the problem is civil servants report to the most senior official in their department – the permanent secretary – and therefore have loyalty to him and not the minister			1
the @entity95 hope the ‘ extended ministerial offices ’ will force @entity1 to raise its game			2
the appointees will be on civil service contracts , and will be able to command salaries of up to £ 84,000 without approval from @entity102			1
but the idea was attacked in the @entity35 yesterday by mps on both sides			2
in a reference to an @entity40 tv series , @entity37 mp @entity106 said the plans would turn the government in to a @entity112 - style administration			2
he said it will be ‘ completely unpopular as far as the country is concerned ’			0
backing : @entity57 promises to cut the number of special advisers , but since being in government has admitted ministers need bigger teams , not smaller @entity61 ’s @entity120 said the plans would allow ministers to employ their friends			0
but mr @entity33 defended the policy , saying : ‘ this is not a plan to import an endless series of political advisers			2
‘ this is actually recognising something that has been recommended to @entity110 by a number of independent think - tanks and others – to allow ministers independent access to external policy expertise which is just sometimes lacking in @entity1 in offices that ministers find themselves in			2
’ communities secretary @entity137 , culture secretary @entity138 and health secretary @entity139 are expected to be the first to expand their coterie of advisers			0
cabinet office minister @entity41 , who drew up the plans , is also expected to hire a larger team			0
@entity145 , general secretary of the @entity146 which represents senior civil servants , said : ‘ the danger is ministerial offices , staffed by personal appointees will ultimately be loyal to their minister , not the taxpayer			1

ministers to have power to create extended private offices to wield power
outside experts expected to be given the power to instruct civil servants
new staff will be able to earn up to £ 84,000 without official approval
insiders say it will end ' yes minister ' idea of civil service as the ' opposition '
@entity37 mps warn @entity33 the plan will be unpopular with *voters*
