by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 09:09 est , 3 july 2012 our galaxy , the @entity1 is still ' ringing ' from a cosmic impact where a smaller galaxy tore through it - and the terrifying collision happened just 100 million years ago , very recently in cosmological terms			1
the ' smoking gun ' was telltale vibrations in nearby stars , which astronomers claim is the equivalent of a ' ringing ' sound left by the enormous impact			1
the collision - either with a tiny galaxy or a hurtling ball of mysterious ' dark matter ' - left our galaxy with unevenly distributed stars , as if a wave was passing through it			1
our galaxy , the @entity1 is still ' ringing ' from a cosmic impact where a smaller galaxy tore through it - and the terrifying collision happened just 100 million years ago , very recently in cosmological time a team of astronomers from @entity30 and the @entity31 have discovered what may well be the smoking gun of such an encounter , one that occurred close to our position in the galaxy and relatively recently , at least in the cosmological sense			1
‘ we have found evidence that our @entity1 had an encounter with a small galaxy or massive dark matter structure perhaps as recently as 100 million years ago , ’ said @entity40 , professor at @entity41 in @entity30			1
‘ we clearly observe unexpected differences in the @entity1 ’s stellar distribution above and below the galaxy ’s midplane that have the appearance of a vertical wave -- something that nobody has seen before			1
’ the discovery is based on observations of some 300,000 nearby @entity1 stars by the @entity57			2
stars in the disk of the @entity1 move up and down at a speed of about 20 - 30 kilometers per second while orbiting the center of the galaxy at a brisk 220 kilometers per second			1
the ' smoking gun ' is an uneven distribution of stars which seems to hint that a massive object such as another galaxy passed straight through the @entity1 @entity40 and his four collaborators from the @entity69 , the @entity70 and @entity71 have found that the positions and motions of these nearby stars were n’t quite as regular as previously thought			1
‘ our part of the @entity1 is ringing like a bell , ’ said @entity75 , of the @entity76 ’s @entity71			2
‘ but we have not been able to identify the celestial object that passed through the @entity1			2
it could have been one of the small satellite galaxies that move around the center of our galaxy , or an invisible structure such as a dark matter halo			0
’ adds @entity86 , professor of physics at the @entity69 : ‘ the perturbation need not have been a single isolated event in the past , and it may even be ongoing			0
additional observations may well clarify its origin			0
’ when the collaboration started analyzing the @entity57 data on the @entity1 , they noticed a small but statistically significant difference in the distribution of stars north and south of the @entity1 ’s midplane			2
for more than a year , the team members explored various explanations of this north - south asymmetry , such as the effect of interstellar dust on distance determinations and the way the stars surveyed were selected			0
when those attempts failed , they began to explore the alternative explanation that the data was telling them something about recent events in the history of the @entity115 scientists used computer simulations to explore what would happen if a satellite galaxy or dark matter structure passed through the disk of the @entity1			0
the simulations indicate that over the next 100 million years or so , our galaxy will ‘ stop ringing : ’ the north - south asymmetry will disappear and the vertical motions of stars in the solar neighborhood will revert back to their equilibrium orbits -- unless we get hit @entity128 is more than 9 billion years old with about 100 billion stars and total mass more than 300 billion times that of the @entity133 of the mass in and around the @entity1 is in the form of dark @entity136 know of more than 20 visible satellite galaxies that circle the center of the @entity1 , with masses ranging from one million to one billion solar masses			1
there may also be invisible satellites made of dark matter			0
( there is six times as much dark matter in the universe as ordinary , visible matter			0
) astronomers ’ computer simulations have found that this invisible matter formed hundreds of massive structures that move around our @entity154 of their abundance , these dark matter satellites are more likely than the visible satellite galaxies to cut through the @entity1 ’s midplane and cause vertical waves			0
‘ future astronomical programs , such as the space - based @entity163 mission , will be able to map out the vertical perturbations in our galaxy in unprecedented detail , ’ @entity40 said			0
‘ that will offer a strong test of our findings			0

' smoking gun ' proves that massive object tore straight through our @entity1 galaxy
collision 100 million years ago - very recently in cosmological terms
uneven stars prove that galaxy is still ' ringing ' from impact
