by @entity0 and @entity1 it was supposed to be a grand celebration of the engineering triumph that forged a nation			1
but instead , the 100th anniversary of the @entity8 's opening was today marred by the failure of plans for a multibillion - dollar expansion			1
the work , which began in the @entity14 country in september 2007 and is the largest project at the canal since its construction , was due to be finished this year			0
however , it has been delayed by 14 months after becoming beset by problems , including cost overruns , strikes and the threat of competition from a @entity25 rival route			1
that followed a two - week stoppage in february in a dispute over $ 1.6billion in extra costs between the canal 's administrator and the @entity69 contractor building a third new set of locks			1
meanwhile , a @entity25 firm was recently awarded a contract to build a $ 40billion ( £ 23billion ) waterway through @entity75 , around 420 miles north			1
the 173 - mile waterway would stretch from @entity77 on the @entity78 through @entity75 to the mouth of the river @entity80 on the @entity82 ; the path initially favored by 19th century @entity85 engineers			2
while just a threat on paper for now , @entity87 authorities have responded with the possibility of digging a fourth set of locks to maintain dominance			0
because of the interruptions and overspending , the canal 's original completion date of this october has been pushed back by 14 months and analysts say more delays ca n't be ruled out			1
journey : the work , which began in the country in september 2007 and is the largest project at the canal since its construction , was due to be finished this year vessel : but it has been delayed by 14 months after becoming beset by problems , including cost overruns , strikes and the threat of competition from a @entity25 rival route			1
above a vessel travels through the miraflores locks of the @entity8 left , two @entity8 workers paddle in their small boat near a cargo ship sailing through the @entity119 and , right , an aerial view of the @entity119 station attraction : locals wave and take photos as a ship passes through the miraflores locks on the @entity8 in january this year the construction of the 48 - mile ship canal across the @entity129 a century ago transformed international trade , greatly reducing travel time between the @entity132 and the @entity82 by eliminating the need for ships to go around the tip of @entity136			1
the construction claimed the lives of an estimated 30,000 workers , many from diseases like malaria and yellow fever			0
as part of the £ 3billion expansion project , wider locks with mechanical gates will reduce congestion and be able accommodate @entity150 vessels , which are as long as three football fields and have the capacity to carry about 2.5 times the number of containers than held by ships currently using the canal			2
canal administrator @entity157 acknowledges he would have liked to finish the expansion in time for friday 's centennial			2
' but we knew from the beginning a project as complex as this would n't necessarily be done on time ' , he said			0
however , not everyone is as understanding			0
@entity166 president @entity165 complained about the delays during a recent visit to @entity8 , saying they affect his country 's trade with the @entity85			2
rivalry : a @entity25 firm was recently awarded a contract to build a $ 40billion ( £ 23billion ) waterway through @entity75 , around 420 miles north of the @entity8 a century old : @entity8 is currently undertaking a massive canal expansion project , with hopes of having an additional traffic lane completed in 14 months grand opening : the canal , which links the @entity132 and @entity82 and revolutionised maritime travel and trade , first opened on august 15 , 1914 two major cargo shippers , @entity186 's @entity185 and @entity166 's @entity187 , have already rerouted part of their operations , depriving the canal of about $ 80 million a year , @entity157 says			1
when funding for the expansion was approved by a referendum in 2006 , its completion was envisioned as a coming out party for @entity8 , a chance to showcase the country 's pro-business credentials and role as a linchpin of global commerce			2
in addition to the proposed waterway through @entity75 , @entity204 is embarking on an expansion of the @entity208			0
reflecting the more subdued mood , president @entity209 opposed suggestions that the centennial be declared a national holiday			1
' the anniversary is best celebrated by working , ' he told journalists recently			0
' @entity8 already has plenty of free days			0
' @entity209 did n't attend a low - key ceremony held at the @entity119 locks friday morning			1
about 100 people , including canal workers , showed up to wave flags and greet cargo ships as they passed by , while a school band played patriotic songs			1
think big : @entity8 has even toyed with the idea of developing a fourth set of mechanical locks , which would further increase the canal 's travel capacity early days : during construction , @entity231 workers used dredging machines to dig. the canal 's expansion will allow for dredging boats to now travel the waterway @entity87 will celebrate their canal 's anniversary with an evening of fireworks and a free concert by salsa crooner @entity242 , before a 500 - pound cake will be served to hundreds of @entity244			1
descendants of @entity231 engineer @entity246 , the canal 's flamboyant first developer , are expected to attend			2
so are relatives of @entity85 president @entity249 , whose enthusiasm for the ' big ditch " ' spurred the isthmus to proclaim its independence from @entity252 in 1903 and sign a treaty granting perpetual control of the future waterway and adjacent 550 - square mile canal zone to the @entity85			0
nostalgia for those earlier days runs deep in @entity260 , or @entity261 in @entity262 , a village on the canal 's @entity82 entrance where blue @entity85 mailboxes recall a vibrant , bygone era when it was part of the canal zone			0
while @entity8 has prospered in the past decade , taxi driver @entity268 said the benefits have n't been shared widely			0
like many @entity87 , he 's counting on the canal expansion to lift the nation 's welfare but is concerned that the recent stumbles could backfire			0
malaria and yellow fever ran rampant during construction with nearly 30,000 workers losing their lives on the project in 1942 , a new set of locks were added near @entity282 , where the bulk of the 100th anniversary celebrations will take place ' the anniversary should 've been the moment to celebrate the expansion project , that all of @entity8 needs urgently , ' said mr @entity268 , the grandson of a canal worker who emigrated from the @entity291			1
' we ca n't afford the luxury of looking like we 're incapable to the rest of the world			0
' linking the @entity129 , the canal eliminated the need for ships to go around the dangerous waters along @entity136 's tip , reducing fuel costs and travel times			0
despite the subdued anniversary , each saturday in august , ' @entity304 nights at the @entity8 , ' will open to the public from 6 to 10pm and will include fireworks , live music , and dancing , as well as historical costumed characters .			2

the 48 - mile ship canal , situated in @entity8 , @entity14 , celebrated the 100th anniversary of its opening today
but celebrations of engineering triumph were marred by doubt as plans for a multi-billion - dollar expansion are failing
massive *upgrade* was supposed to be completed by october , but has been delayed by 14 months following problems
these include cost overruns , strikes and threat of competition from @entity25 rival route in @entity75 , 420 miles north
president of @entity333 today opposed suggestions that the centennial be declared national holiday
about 100 people turned up to wave flags and greet cargo ships in small ceremony at @entity119 locks this morning
locals will celebrate canal 's anniversary with evening of fireworks and free concert by salsa crooner @entity242
