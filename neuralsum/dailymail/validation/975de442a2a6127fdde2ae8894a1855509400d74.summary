from cute animals to @entity2 and even the @entity3 , it seems that virtually everyone has managed to get in on the photobombing craze			2
and now it seems even the spirits of the dead are making an appearance after two teenagers spotted what seems to be a ghostly girl in the background of a @entity15 selfie			1
@entity16 , from @entity17 , took a picture of herself , her baby nephew and her sister to show friends , but later noticed what seemed to be a little girl 's torso in the background			1
closer inspection revealed what looked like a young girl wearing a purple dress sitting down with her hands folded neatly in her lap. @entity16 , from @entity17 , captioned her snapchat selfie ' photo bombed ! ' after her sister jumped into the background ( left ) , but another ghostly figure also seems to have got in on the act ( right ) miss @entity16 told the @entity35 : ' i was taking a picture of my nephew and i , but my sister jumped into the background so i captioned the picture " photo bombed ! " ' a friend of mine came to my house that night and pointed out what looks to be a woman with her hands folded on her knees in the background , baring in mind the picture was taken facing the living room door			1
' although we ca n't see the face of the figure the rest of it is as clear as day			2
there was nobody else in the living room at the time , except for the ghost girl in the purple dress			1
' she added that she is now terrified of going into her living room in the dark in case she catches another glimpse of the spectre			2
it is not the first time that a lost soul has apparently wandered into a @entity15 photograph			2
@entity71 , 23 , and @entity72 , 22 , from @entity73 , were on a night out in the town centre when they decided to take a snap to send to friends			1
they were having drinks in the @entity80 on @entity81 , which they said was virtually empty , when the image was captured			1
but when they looked closer at the image , they saw what appeared to be the tormented face of a ghostly woman dressed in @entity89 clothing between their heads			1
miss @entity72 , who works as a nurse , said : ‘ we took the picture in the bar as we usually would , we are both fans of a selfie			0
' i uploaded the picture to @entity15 and thought nothing more of it			0
but later that night @entity71 rang me in a panic and told me to have a closer look			0
' she said there was a figure in the background , and i am quite sceptical about things like that so i just laughed at the time			1
' i could n't look at the picture at the beginning as i was too freaked out			0
it is so clear , and it looks like what can only be described as a @entity89 woman , laughing behind us			0
’ local authority worker @entity133 added : ‘ the bar was dead when we went in			0
it was only when i got home later on that i noticed the photo			2
' i could n't believe it			0
i was absolutely terrified and @entity72 was so scared that she deleted the photo off her phone			0
a lot of people have said we must have photoshopped the picture			0
' i ca n't blame them , but neither of us would even know how to do that			0
i did n't believe in ghosts at all before , but i 'm not so sure any more			0
’ the image also comes just days after an @entity151 family apparently photographed the spirit of a young girl who drowned in a swimming hole while they were taking a dip there			1
@entity114 and @entity115 say they were with their three children when they took the image , but another child can be seen in the centre of the picture			2
after the image attracted a lot of attention online the pair did some research and found that a young girl drowned in the same spot 100 years ago .			1
