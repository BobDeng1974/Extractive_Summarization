by @entity0 published : 13:39 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 17:30 est , 16 november 2012 this is n't a job for the feint hearted - cutting branches while balancing 100ft in the air on a swaying tree trunk			2
thankfully , there was n't a strong wind blowing when this tree surgeon took his razor - sharp chainsaw to this eucalyptus tree in @entity13 , @entity14			1
slowly , branch by branch , he gave the 35 - year - old tree a good haircut , some might call it an old - fashioned short , back and sides			1
this tree surgeon is n't fazed by the height or swaying trunk as he takes his chainsaw to the 35 - year - old eucalyptus success : another branch gone ... slowly but surely the tree surgeon makes headway @entity29 trees , like the one pictured here , are evergreen and are grown mainly for their foliage and peeling bark			1
they 're famous - or infamous - for their rapid growth and can quickly become unmanageable if left unpruned			1
but they do have desirable traits , such as being a good source of wood , producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural insecticide			0
another big branch gets the chop and the tree slowly loses its foliage @entity29 trees like the one pictured are evergreen and are grown mainly for their foliage and peeling bark what branch is next ? it must be tiring work all this pruning , but then it was a big tree they 've even been used to drain swamps and thereby reduce the risk of malaria in some countries , although some plant lovers have criticised them for being ' invasive water - suckers '			0
this particular eucalyptus however has had its day			0
after the severe haircut , the tree surgeon turned his lethal chainsaw on the trunk , slowly chopping it down			2
after several hours of chopping and pruning the once mighty 100ft tree was no more than a stump			0
these trees are a good source of wood , producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural insecticide almost all gone : just half the trunk remaining before this tree ends up as a stump			0

100ft eucalyptus tree in @entity14 gets the chop by brave tree surgeon
the 35 - year - old tree was hacked back to a stump just a few feet high
they 're known for their rapid growth and can quickly become unmanageable if left unpruned
