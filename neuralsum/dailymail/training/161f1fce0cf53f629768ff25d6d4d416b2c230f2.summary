by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 05:40 est , 8 april 2013 dr @entity1 said that hospitals would be forced to slim down considerably hospitals will have to shrink or close altogether in the wake of new reforms that have given @entity7 control of more than two - thirds of the health service ’s annual budget			1
dr @entity1 , who represents many of the clinical commissioning groups ( @entity13 ) that last week took control of £ 65bn of health spending , said that hospitals would be forced to slim down considerably as more services are moved out to the community			2
under the new reforms , every @entity20 ’s practice in @entity21 is affiliated to one of 211 commissioning groups , whose boards of @entity7 , nurses , hospital doctors and lay members will decide how to spend the local health budget			1
the reforms -- which replace the old local @entity29 – are intended to cut bureaucracy , reduce costs and foster competition , encouraging private firms and charities to take on health service contracts			2
dr @entity1 told @entity38 that diagnostic tests , outpatient appointments and much of care for the elderly should be moved to local clinics to improve services to patients and save money			1
his vision is that rather than being one of first port of calls for medical treatment , hospitals would need to downsize and become centres of excellence for specialist , and / or intensive care			1
patients needing more general care could be looked after in the community			1
care of elderly patients , in particular , could radically change under the reforms			1
older people account for around 70 per cent of hospital bed occupancy , but could in the future be cared for at home by teams of community - based health professionals , dr @entity1 said			0
dr @entity1 , interim president of @entity70 , said believes that at least believes that half of hospitals ’ current workloads ‘ could or should be done elsewhere ’			2
he added that there was an ‘ an awful lot of fat ’ in the @entity70 budget and the health service needed to become more patient - friendly			1
when asked by the newspaper whether the reforms would mean hospitals had to slim down , close or both , dr @entity1 said both would be options			0
the issue of gps holding the purse strings could also damage relationships with patients , he conceded , given how vehemently opposed local hospital closures are opposed by residents			0
new reforms introduced last week mean that @entity7 have responsibility for more than two - thirds of the health service 's annual budget he said that @entity13 were ‘ up ’ for pushing through the reforms needed – while managing the demands of the elderly population on the @entity70 – would need ‘ considerable protection and support ’ to implement necessary changes			1
the @entity101 has said that changes to the services offered by hospitals should be a gradual process and based on clinical evidence rather than cost - cutting			0
@entity108 , chief executive of the @entity109 , which represents hospitals , said the ageing population meant hospitals had to change how they operated , the aim being to keep people living independently out of hospitals for longer			0
he said : ‘ this is a difficult journey but it 's one the @entity70 has to make			0
a good analogy is that until the 1980s people with mental illness and learning disabilities were looked after in hospitals and then there was a big shift of care into the community			2
that was controversial at the time but is now , years later , recognised as having been the right thing			0
’ ; he added that a large proportion of hospital staff would have to start working in non-hospital settings to make the new forms of care work for a report last year for the @entity136 found that many hospital buildings , services and staff are not equipped to deal with the increasing number of older people being admitted to hospital with multiple , complex needs , including dementia .			0

new reforms mean @entity7 will look after two - thirds of the annual @entity70 budget
more patients will be treated in community to improve care and save money
hospitals should focus on specialist care and reduce workload by 50 *%*
will have to downsize and also will need fewer staff , say *experts*
