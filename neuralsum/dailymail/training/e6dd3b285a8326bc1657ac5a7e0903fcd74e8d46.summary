by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 07:06 est , 25 september 2012 the infection is as grim as it sounds : ' @entity2 ' have a parasite that causes them to fly at night and lurch around erratically until they die			2
and experts say the condition has crept into @entity8			1
' i joke with my kids that the zombie apocalypse is starting at my house , ' said @entity13 , a novice beekeeper who spotted the infected insects at his suburban @entity16 home			1
@entity18 invasion : @entity13 , a novice beekeeper in @entity8 , holds up a plastic bag with a dead zombie bee and pupae - two at each end of the bag			1
@entity13 returned from vacation a few weeks ago to find many of his bees either dead or flying in jerky patterns and then flopping on the floor			2
he remembered hearing about zombie bees , so he collected several of the corpses and popped them into a plastic bag			2
about a week later , the @entity33 man had evidence his bees were infected : the pupae of parasitic flies			1
' @entity37 got the better of me , ' @entity13 said			2
the zombie bees were the first to be confirmed in @entity8 , the @entity39 reported			1
@entity42 biologist @entity41 first discovered zombie bees in @entity44 in 2008			1
@entity41 now uses a website to recruit citizen scientists like @entity13 to track the infection across the country			2
observers also have found zombie bees in @entity51 and @entity52			1
the infection is another threat to bees that are needed to pollinate crops			0
hives have been failing in recent years due to a mysterious ailment called colony collapse disorder , in which all the adult honey bees in a colony suddenly die			0
life cycle of the zombie fly : the parasite attacks the creature , in a destructive circle of life the life cycle of the fly that infects zombie bees is reminiscent of the movie ' @entity73 , ' the newspaper reported			0
a small adult female lands on the back of a honeybee and injects eggs into the bee 's abdomen			0
the eggs hatch into maggots			0
' they basically eat the insides out of the bee , ' @entity41 said			0
after consuming their host , the maggots pupate , forming a hard outer shell that looks like a fat , brown grain of rice			0
that 's what @entity13 found in the plastic bag with the dead bees			1
adult flies emerge in three to four weeks			0
@entity13 , a novice beekeeper , checks out bees in one of the hives in the backyard of his @entity33 , @entity8 home			1
his are the firm zombie bee infections found in the state			1
there 's no evidence yet that the parasitic fly is a major player in the bees ' decline , but it does seem the pest is targeting new hosts , said @entity110 , chairman of the entomology department at @entity8			1
' it may occur a lot more widely than we think , ' he said			0
that 's what @entity41 hopes to find out with his website , zombeewatch.org			0
the site offers simple instructions for collecting suspect bees , watching for signs of parasites and reporting the results			0
once more people start looking , the number of sightings will probably climb , @entity13 said .			0
