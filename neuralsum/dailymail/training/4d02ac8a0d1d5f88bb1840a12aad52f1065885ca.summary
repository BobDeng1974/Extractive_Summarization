a new wing of global terror group @entity1 which has formed in @entity2 , could be set to target the @entity3			1
it comes after the group , who have been named @entity1 in the @entity7 ( @entity8 ) released a video earlier this week announcing their formation			1
in it @entity1 leader @entity12 says they will ' raise the flag of jihad ' across the ' @entity7 '			1
the site monitoring service quoted @entity8 spokesman @entity28 as saying the group 's goals include ' waging jihad against @entity3 and the system of global disbelief ' , and ' uprooting it , in order to establish @entity36 - based governance ' , according to an audio speech			1
he added : ' this is the system that put upon worshippers of @entity41 a political system built on non-religious , democratic , secular principles , and weakened the @entity45 creed and corrupted @entity47 society			0
@entity1 leader @entity12 announced the formation of an @entity7 branch of his militant group he said would spread @entity45 rule and ' raise the flag of jihad ' across the subcontinent			1
he said : ' my @entity47 brothers everywhere , peace be with you today , i announce to all @entity47 in the world and especially in the @entity7 subcontinent , the founding of a new branch of @entity63			0
' this is to help raise the flag of jihad and the return of the @entity45 rule in the subcontinent , which one day used to be part of the land of the @entity47 until the infidel enemy took it over and divided it			1
' he also renewed a longstanding vow of loyalty to @entity77 @entity76 leader @entity75 , in an apparent snub to the @entity80 armed group challenging @entity1 for leadership of transnational @entity83 militancy			2
@entity84 described the formation of ' @entity1 in the @entity7 ' as glad tidings for @entity47 ' in @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92 ' and said the new wing would rescue @entity47 there from injustice and oppression			1
' and because of this system , apostate , traitor armies were put upon the @entity45 lands and the rulers hostile to @entity45			0
' the formation of the new wing of @entity1 comes as the @entity3 , @entity104 and other western countries focus on the continuing threat from @entity107 , who have declared parts of @entity110 and @entity111 an @entity45 state			1
it is thought that @entity107 recently split from @entity1 's control in a direct challenge to their authority			1
the timing and content of the video suggests rivalry between @entity1 and @entity107 , which anecdotal evidence suggests is gathering support in @entity123			1
according to media reports , @entity80 pamphlets have been distributed in @entity126 in recent days			0
' @entity1 has seen its authority eroded by the fact that it is no longer able to independently carry out large - scale attacks anywhere in the world , and by the emergence of rival factions , ' @entity127 , head of @entity123 analysis at security research firm @entity129 , wrote in a report			2
@entity1 's establishment of a local branch seeks to take advantage of the planned withdrawal of @entity3 - led forces from @entity77 , which may lead to an influx of battle - hardened militants into @entity2 , @entity127 added			1
until a few days ago , there has been no evidence that @entity1 had a presence in @entity2			2
on thursday , several provinces in @entity2 were put on alert after the announcement of the formation of @entity8			2
@entity151 regards the message as authentic and has warned local governments , said an official who attended a security briefing in which it was discussed with home minister @entity157 , who is responsible for policing and internal security			0
an official said : ' this matter has been taken very seriously			0
an alert has been sounded			0
' @entity7 security forces are usually on a state of alert for attacks by home - grown @entity83 militants and by @entity169 groups based in @entity126			0
it was not immediately clear what additional steps were being taken			0
@entity84 's announcement made two references to @entity90 , the home state of @entity2 's prime minister @entity174 , a @entity176 nationalist			2
hedescribed the formation of ' @entity1 in the @entity7 ' as glad tidings for @entity47 ' in @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92 ' and said the new wing would rescue @entity47 there from injustice and oppression			2
tensions between @entity176 and @entity47 on the subcontinent have grown since @entity126 was carved from muslim - majority areas of @entity2 in 1947 in a violent partition in which hundreds of thousands were killed			0
@entity92 , which is claimed by both @entity2 and @entity126 , has long attracted foreign mujahideen fighters as well as home - grown separatist militants			0
in june , @entity1 released a video urging young radicals in @entity92 to draw inspiration from militants in @entity111 and @entity110 and join the ' global jihad ' .			0

new @entity1 wing say their goals include ' waging jihad against @entity3 '
add that they want to establish ' @entity36 - based governance ' in audio speech
comes after @entity1 in @entity2 announced their formation earlier in the week
@entity12 said group would fight for an @entity45 state in the country
he said his group had been preparing for years to set up in the region
but some say it 's part of an effort to win back media attention from @entity107
