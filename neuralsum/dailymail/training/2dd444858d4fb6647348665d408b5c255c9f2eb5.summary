@entity0 , pictured , who has just turned 40 , has never been married and does not have any children he is a revered global statesman , courted by prime ministers and rock stars for his good works			1
she is on course to be the first woman president of the @entity10			1
few would bet against what is mockingly being called the ‘ @entity12 ’ to the @entity13			1
political pundits have little doubt that @entity17 @entity16 will be powered to victory by her popular and politically brilliant husband , @entity20 , next year and the country that supposedly rejected monarchy centuries ago will have their royal family back on the throne			2
when even @entity27 contenders are loath to throw their hats into the ring , fearing they will lose , who would dare rock the @entity31 boat ? the answer came this week when a blast from the past has reappeared to cause damage — perhaps irreparable — to both of them			1
@entity0 , the ‘ other woman ’ who embroiled the @entity39 in one of the biggest political scandals of the last century , has broken more than a decade of silence			1
in a long essay for @entity45 magazine , she has reminded @entity10 of an episode in @entity31 history that was anything but glorious			1
between 1995 and 1997 , president @entity31 — then turning 50 — and the @entity13 intern in her early 20s had an affair which ranged all over the @entity13			1
their trysts took place in bathrooms , hallways , even the pantry			0
then , @entity0 foolishly confided in a colleague , who advised the naive intern to preserve any evidence of the affair — including , infamously , a stained blue dress — and record her conversations with the president			1
@entity31 famously denied ‘ sexual relations with that woman ’ , then humiliatingly had to admit that he had lied			1
@entity0 , left , broke her media silence over her relationship with president @entity31 , right , in an interview with @entity45 he became only the second @entity10 president to have impeachment proceedings launched against him , but the @entity72 acquitted him of lying under oath and obstruction of justice			1
remarkably , his marriage survived			0
previously unpopular with voters , mrs @entity16 leapt in the polls as she played the loyal wife			0
miss @entity0 , meanwhile , became the punchline for a thousand smutty jokes			1
ever since , she now claims , she has been saddled with a reputation as the ultimate office slut			0
she says she was made a scapegoat by the @entity31 camp who labelled her ‘ the @entity86 ’			1
she is clearly still haunted by the scandal			0
in the @entity45 article , she reveals how , overcome by ‘ the shame , the scorn and the fear ’ that had been ‘ thrown ’ at her , she contemplated suicide several times in the years following the revelations			1
her mother would stay by her bed , night after night , to watch her			0
the @entity31 administration demonised her so successfully , she writes , that she has never been able to leave the affair behind			1
now 40 and with a masters degree in psychology from the @entity101 , she still can not find a decent job because of her notoriety			0
‘ i wish [ the @entity39 ] no ill , ’ she announces at the end of her 4,300 - word screed in @entity45			1
but she can not possibly wish them well			0
the tone of her piece , which is illustrated with a come - hitherish shot of her lounging on a sofa , is supremely self - pitying , even if you can sympathise with at least some of her complaints			2
it must have been painful to have watched the @entity39 breeze from success to success while she is still seen as the voluptuous vixen who almost brought down a president			2
interestingly , she directs most of her fire not on the man she says ‘ took advantage of me ’ , but on the wife who stood by him			0
is this surprising ? not to many @entity10 political observers , especially @entity27 , who see her intervention as a blatant attempt to derail @entity16 ’s bid for the @entity13			1
@entity16 is being widely tipped as a strong candidate to run for president in 2016 the timing is suspicious			2
mrs @entity16 has a new memoir out next month — the perfect moment , many believe , to announce that she will indeed run in 2016			0
if she does , her husband , whose electioneering skills are second to none , is expected to be a crucial part of her campaign			2
following ms @entity0 ’s latest sally , however , the @entity10 media are asking about @entity0 , not @entity16			1
miss @entity0 says she refused numerous interview offers during mrs @entity16 ’s 2008 presidential run against @entity142 , because as a ‘ conscientious @entity17 ’ , she feared she would be used to damage the party			1
six years on , however , it ’s no more miss @entity145			0
‘ i turned 40 last year , and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past — and other people ’s futures , ’ she writes			0
but there ’s another reason why she might suddenly have become less sensitive about hurting the @entity39 , and @entity16 in particular			0
as miss @entity0 recounts , previously unpublished papers revealed in february that mrs @entity16 had made some choice remarks about her love rival to her best friend , @entity155			1
although mrs @entity31 found her husband ’s ‘ lapse ’ with @entity0 inexcusable , she praised him for ‘ trying to manage someone who was clearly a “ narcissistic loony toon ” ’			1
mrs @entity16 also revealed she partly blamed herself for her husband ’s philandering because she had been ‘ inattentive to his needs ’			0
@entity31 , pictured , was only the second president to face impeachment while in office miss @entity0 writes that mrs @entity16 ’s description of her made her ‘ bristle ’			1
worse , she adds , it began to ‘ gnaw ’ at her that mrs @entity16 had wanted her uncharitable comments to come out , as she had encouraged @entity155 to keep a record of their chats for posterity			0
‘ @entity16 wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband ’s mistress , ’ @entity175 gripes in @entity45			2
‘ but i find her impulse to blame the woman — not only me , but herself — troubling			2
’ given that mrs @entity16 ’s presidential ambitions largely rely on appealing to women voters , accusing her of betraying the sisterhood is about the most politically damaging accusation @entity186 could have made			0
she also takes aim at other women , particularly feminists , whom she had expected to rally to her side as the @entity191 establishment portrayed her as a husband - stealing flirt , but who failed to do so			2
with no one to fight her cause , she claims , she was left to slink off into the shadows			0
despite her tales of financial woes and endless job rejections , @entity0 exploited her notoriety effectively			2
she co-operated with a biography written by @entity203 and — trading on her name — started designing expensive knitted handbags			0
she also appeared in a string of tv shows , including a dating show and a stint as a @entity10 correspondent for @entity211 in @entity212			0
in 2005 , she moved to @entity213 to study at the @entity101 to reinvent herself			0
the staff and students were ‘ wonderful — welcoming and respectful ’ , she says now			0
but moving back to the @entity10 , she reveals her attempts to carve out a career have been dogged by her notoriety			0
‘ because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my “ history ” , i was never “ quite right ” for the position , ’ she writes			0
her love life has been similarly blighted			0
‘ with every man i date , i go through some degree of 1998 whiplash , ’ says @entity0 , who has never married or had children			1
as for the @entity39 , she sniffs that she ‘ understands that what has happened to me and the issue of my future do not matter to them ’			2
she ‘ deeply regrets ’ the affair , criticising her lover ’s ‘ gross , inappropriate behaviour ’ , but concedes it was a ‘ consensual ’ relationship			1
many republicans , keen to find anything that can stop the seemingly unstoppable @entity31 juggernaut , had been dredging up the @entity240 affair long before the @entity45 article			1
in february , potential @entity27 @entity13 contender @entity242 accused the @entity243 of hypocrisy for claiming to support women ’s rights while exonerating mr @entity31 of his ‘ predatory ’ behaviour			1
some @entity27 have cautioned against resorting to dirty tactics , so there is widespread delight that @entity0 has done it for them			2
has she finally exacted the ultimate revenge ? ‘ like many other @entity10 , i ’ve been thinking about @entity16 , ’ she muses			0
‘ what might happen if she does run in 2016 ? ’ one thing ’s guaranteed			0
the @entity39 wo n’t be allowed to forget the biggest blot in their copy - book .			2

@entity0 broke her decade - long media silence in @entity45
the former @entity13 intern refused media requests during 2008 campaign
president @entity31 famously denied ever having ' sexual relations with that woman '
@entity0 admits that she ' deeply regrets ' what happened in 1998 with president @entity31
