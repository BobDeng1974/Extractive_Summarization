the grandson of @entity1 believes he has solved the mystery of how his grandmother met her end aged just 40 over a century ago			1
speculation over the sudden death of @entity7 had ranged from spinal damage after falling down some stairs or syphilis picked up from her husband			1
it was a tragic end to a tragic life			0
now , 116 years later , evidence suggests that she fell victim to eccentric medical practices and a botched operation after doctors misdiagnosed multiple sclerosis , although the condition was known by then			1
the death of @entity7 - the wife of author @entity24 ( right ) - has been a mystery for more than a century but the author 's grandson now claims she had undiagnosed multiple sclerosis @entity30 , whose grandfather wrote masterpieces including @entity33 and @entity34 , discovered medical evidence among family letters that his mother had not wanted to make public while she was alive			1
he says : ' it 's always been a question really			2
what did @entity7 really die of ? ' those letters bear crucial passages from which a doctor , @entity43 , has been able to diagnose symptoms nowadays associated with multiple sclerosis			1
unable to walk , she suffered debilitating pain across her body , extreme headaches and fatigue , but the seriousness of her condition went unnoticed by her two doctors			2
one of them was an unnamed @entity55 ' nerve doctor ' , who believed in treating patients with baths and electricity , and the other was an @entity61 , @entity60 , who somehow thought that neurological and mental illness could be cured with gynaecological operations			2
although @entity60 had already conducted one operation which failed to improve her condition , @entity7 returned to him for a gynaecological procedure			1
days later , she became unconscious and died			0
two decades later , he faced unrelated accusations of unethical behaviour and professional misconduct and – in a final irony in this tragic saga – he was shot dead in his consulting room in @entity74 by the jealous husband of a patient , who then fired at his wife before turning the gun on himself			1
@entity7 's brother , @entity79 , was left devastated , but realised that any legal action was pointless because she had been convinced by @entity60 that surgery would relieve her disabilities and enable her to lead a normal life			1
@entity30 made the discovery after finding a set of medical notes of the writer 's long - suffering wife her grandson said : ' @entity93 's @entity91 and @entity92 doctors had warned her not to be coaxed into surgery , but she ignored their advice , confident that @entity60 's treatment would rehabilitate her ; instead it cost her her life			1
' ultimately , both @entity60 and the hapless @entity93 met their ends tragically - he by the bullet of an assassin and she by the knife of an irresponsible surgeon			0
' the @entity104 , the leading medical journal , has taken the evidence seriously to publish a paper jointly written by @entity30 and @entity43 , a specialist at the @entity109 in @entity110			2
@entity30 hopes that this will now dispel the ' @entity7 death speculations ' and bring ' closure ' for @entity93 , who died less than a year after her husband 's release from prison			1
having been virtually abandoned by her mother , following the death of her father - she and her brother were brought up by their grandfather – she married @entity1 in 1884 and , after his imprisonment for homosexual acts in 1895 , had to flee to @entity126 with their two boys			2
she changed their surname to ' @entity30 ' , an ancestral family name , and eventually settled near @entity132			0
the evidence emerged from around 130 letters written between @entity135 and her brother , between 1878 and her death			2
@entity7 , who was played by @entity138 in the 1996 film @entity1 , married the author ( right ) in 1884 in 1894 , she wrote : ' i am alright when i do n't walk			1
' a year later , her walking had deteriorated , but she had put her faith in @entity60 who ' undertakes to make me quite well in six weeks and i shall be glad to be able to walk again '			0
but by 1896 , her condition had deteriorated further : ' i am lamer than ever and have almost given up hope of ever getting well again			0
' @entity30 recalls that his mother ' did n't particularly want anyone to have access ' to them , ' frightened of what , in an age of sensationalising everything , someone might do with them '			0
the first generation out from the literary personality is often rather ' overprotective ' , he observes			0
he notes that although biographers had mentioned a gynaecological operation , there were few details : ' people somehow never put two and two together and thought ' why is a gynaecologist operating on her spine ? ' the letters reveal that @entity60 removed fibroids , benign tumours , having ' totally wrongly diagnosed what was the matter with her ' , @entity30 said			1
' in those days … it was an extremely dangerous operation			0
' in closing this chapter of his grandmother 's life , @entity30 said : ' i rather feel it will put @entity135 to rest , poor thing			0
' he visited her grave this summer : ' we can not go past @entity132 without going and paying our respects to her			0
we went and put some flowers on her grave			0
every time i go there , i feel she 's rather alone in exile in @entity132			2
' today , by chance , would have been his grandmother 's birthday .			0
