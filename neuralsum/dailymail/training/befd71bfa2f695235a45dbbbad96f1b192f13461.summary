@entity0 went to the top of the @entity2 for at least 24 hours after a richly deserved 31 - 15 victory that left @entity4 still in pursuit of a first win at @entity7			2
two tries for @entity16 wing @entity14 plus one from number eight @entity8 , and 10 points from the boot of fly - half @entity11 , steered @entity0 to a 25 - 8 half - time lead , and two more @entity11 penalties after the break sealed the success			1
@entity4 initially matched their hosts with a penalty from fly - half @entity24 , but against a strong @entity0 defence the visitors could manage just the one try before the break through former @entity16 under - 20 full - back @entity28			1
@entity0 fly half kicked four penalties and two conversions to help his side to a 31 - 15 victory despite five scrum penalties five metres from the @entity36 line , they were not awarded a penalty try after the break			2
a @entity40 try which was converted by @entity41 proved insufficient to give @entity4 a foothold			0
the @entity0 made two changes from the side that beat league leaders @entity46 24 - 18 at @entity47 last weekend with @entity48 at blindside flanker and @entity50 at inside centre			2
there were three changes to the @entity4 side as @entity55 came in at openside flanker , after international duty , and @entity59 lock @entity58 and @entity61 prop @entity60 returned			0
@entity0 winger @entity14 ( left ) scored two tries in an impressive display at @entity7 full - back @entity64 , who this week agreed a new two - year deal with the @entity0 , was making his 100th league appearance for the team which was matched by @entity4 ' @entity16 - capped scrum - half @entity70			1
@entity0 made the perfect start when scrum - half @entity72 perfectly timed his offload for @entity14 to score out wide , with fly - half @entity11 's conversion squeezing just inside the far upright			1
wasps were quickly back up the other end where they won a penalty in front of the posts which @entity16 international @entity24 slotted between the uprights , however @entity11 soon countered that for @entity0			1
@entity36 centre @entity82 ( left ) can only watch as @entity4 full back @entity28 crashes over for @entity4 a quick tap penalty allowed the visitors to spread the ball wide with an overlap available as full - back @entity28 came into the line to touch down			0
@entity24 was unable to convert but @entity11 then found the target with a penalty			0
@entity4 tested the @entity36 defence , which stood firm , and the home side reacted with @entity14 scoring a second try as he shrugged off a couple of defenders to cross the line			1
the visitors then lost wing @entity100 with an ankle injury to be replaced by @entity103			1
a @entity0 catch and drive led to @entity103 getting the try which @entity11 converted to ensure the 17 - point gap between the sides at the interval			1
@entity0 's @entity108 bursts past @entity109 as the @entity0 chased a bonus point in the second half @entity4 started the second half the stronger and caused the @entity36 problems at the scrum close to the line where they were awarded three penalties , but on the fourth occasion tighthead prop @entity103 was sent to the sin bin			0
the next two scrums saw both front rows stood up before reinforcements were sent in to continue the battle five metres from the @entity36 line , only for @entity4 to be awarded another penalty			0
referee @entity124 seemed unwilling to award the visitors a penalty try but instead @entity0 gained the next scrum penalty and were able to clear their line as they remained down to 14 men			0
wasps were left scratching their heads wondering as to why they gained nothing for the efforts which would have got them back in the game			0
when the @entity0 finally got out of their own territory , @entity11 landed his third penalty			1
@entity4 replacements @entity103 and @entity41 saw a break from deep in their own half and replacement hooker @entity141 crossed from short range			0
@entity41 converted but @entity11 slotted another penalty			0
the home side went in search of a try - scoring bonus point and @entity4 had to play the final two minutes with centre @entity109 in the sin bin .			2

@entity16 winger @entity14 scored a brace for the home side
number eight @entity8 also *powered* over for the @entity0
@entity11 registered 16 points with the boot
@entity160 lost @entity100 to an ankle injury
