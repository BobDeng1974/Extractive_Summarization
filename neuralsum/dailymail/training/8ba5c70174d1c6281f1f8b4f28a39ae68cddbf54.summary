he was only officially told that he was playing two hours before kickoff but in reality there was no doubt			0
the man who humiliated @entity6 on one leg four weeks after a knee operation was hardly going to wait another second once his four - month ban was over			0
@entity11 was back in a competitive game on saturday for the first time since sinking his teeth into @entity15			1
and while @entity17 were being vociferously serenaded in the @entity18 after a masterful performance , it was easy to forget @entity11 might have won @entity20 the game early on			1
former @entity22 striker @entity11 is tackled by @entity23 as @entity24 ( centre ) and @entity26 ( right ) look on here was the @entity11 we know , charging around , unable to concede any cause , however lost			2
and here was the quality at which we came to wonder in the precise , raking cross that found @entity32 on three minutes to open the scoring			0
he did it again on 23 minutes , another delightful ball from the right into the path of @entity38			0
on this occasion @entity39 made a fantastic save			0
and on that moment the game turned			0
‘ we could have scored the second , ’ said @entity11			2
‘ after that , they hurt us with their tactics and killed us on the counter			1
we have a one - point advantage in the league so we have to be positive			0
’ @entity11 was a constant thorn in the side of the @entity17 defence and caused havoc on his @entity20 debut afterwards his manager @entity55 deemed that he had done ‘ pretty well — better than expected			1
’ he lasted 68 minutes and in that first half especially was a major contributor			0
the ‘ bittersweet ’ feeling @entity11 spoke of after was the fact that his return was tempered by such a dominant @entity17 victory			1
by the end the @entity18 was united in a chorus of @entity64 — a poke in the eye of growing @entity68 nationalism — and roaring those ‘ @entity72 ’ as their team passed the ball around			2
as @entity73 , scorer of the second goal , said : ‘ it ’s a long time since we heard “ oles ” at the @entity18 against @entity20			1
’ @entity11 celebrates after assisting @entity32 just three minutes into his @entity20 debut since his summer move @entity81 international @entity80 finished a superb move to give @entity17 a two goal advantage @entity17 looked formidable , much more than a team of @entity85 , but a balanced unit			1
the fear for @entity11 is that he has joined @entity20 just as the balance of power is tilting @entity17 ’s way			1
in most areas , @entity17 were superior			2
you will struggle to find defenders as strong as @entity73 and @entity26 or midfielders with the poise of @entity24 and @entity95			2
the greatest compliment you can pay @entity24 and @entity95 is that they made @entity98 and @entity99 look old			0
@entity100 surpassed @entity38 in the battle of the superstars but he was just one of many , with @entity23 and @entity80 also excellent			1
‘ i have a very professional team who understand what it means sacrifice themselves for the team , ’ said manager @entity103			0
‘ to win against @entity20 in the manner we did is really important			2
’ @entity111 shows @entity112 as part of an unrivalled autumn of sport that includes coverage of the @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity120 tennis , autumn international rugby and @entity122			0
@entity17 players celebrate after earning a 3 - 1 win against @entity20 in @entity125			1

@entity11 made his @entity20 debut against @entity17 at the @entity18
he had a good game , but it was *overshadowed* by @entity17 *'s* performance
@entity100 , @entity73 and @entity80 scored in a 3 - 1 win
@entity11 : ' real hurt us with their tactics and killed us on the counter '
