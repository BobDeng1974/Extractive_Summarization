by @entity0 outside the occupied @entity3 police station , sandbags were being piled for protection as a car slammed to a halt			1
out jumped four men , wearing military uniforms and carrying a range of weapons including rifles , pistols and knives			0
one held a @entity16 by the nozzle in each hand			0
another had an assault rifle slung over his shoulder , a pistol in his belt and a radio listening device in his right ear			0
@entity0 interviews a soldier in front of a @entity3 government building occupied by @entity33 forces as the sun bore down on @entity36 , a small industrial city emerging as a front line in the struggle convulsing this shattered country , i persuaded this pair to talk			1
who were they , i asked ? ‘ we are in the world army , ’ said one , his eyes hidden by sunglasses			0
@entity48 conversations have been commonplace during this conflict between @entity50 and @entity51 – but he spoke with a strong @entity53 accent			1
loosening up , he confessed to coming from @entity54 – the @entity56 city that is home to @entity53 ’s @entity57 and which was used as a launchpad for the region ’s recent annexation			1
so what did he think would happen here ? ‘ there will be war , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity65 has invested too much in @entity3			1
@entity66 will end up fighting us so we must be ready			0
’ it was a chilling threat – not least since the man identified himself later as a marine officer who had served in @entity71 and a parachutist with more than 1,600 jumps			0
hours earlier i heard self - styled separatist leaders in eastern @entity3 insist there were no arms at any seized buildings			1
yet i had already watched eight more gunmen enter the station ; another six arrived soon after with bed mats			0
a protestant minister leads prayers to @entity33 activists who are occupying the @entity85 in @entity3 @entity50 claims that @entity33 activists such as this man ( pictured ) want a referendum on the future of @entity3 these menacing forces undermine president @entity92 ’s claims that @entity53 is not involved in this insurgency			1
yesterday , as they openly patrolled outside @entity36 , @entity92 confirmed extra troops had been deployed on the border as a ‘ precautionary ’ measure			1
when i said the @entity65 did not want war , the officer in sunglasses pointed out @entity101 had not wanted bloodshed in @entity103 either			1
‘ but look what happened – you ended up fighting there for years			0
’ he pointed at the glinting golden domes of an @entity110 cathedral nearby when i asked why he would risk his life for this cause			0
‘ we are fighting for our religion like the @entity115 , ’ he said			0
@entity3 is divided not just by language but by two strands of @entity110 religion , with one looking to @entity51 and the other to @entity50			1
@entity92 is stoking up deep - seated cultural , historic and religious divisions			1
officially , there are no @entity53 forces in this part of the country – the president himself said so last week			1
but then he also finally ended his charade over the stealth invasion of @entity56 , admitting all those silent troops in unmarked uniforms who popped up across the peninsula before annexation were @entity53			1
@entity3 is a deeply divided country with many ethnic @entity53 who look towards @entity50 for one month , i watched that slow strangulation of @entity56 – and these events in eastern @entity3 seem to bear a startling similarity as separatists occupy key strategic sites , then demand a rapid referendum on ‘ independence ’			1
some soldiers in @entity36 even banter over being in @entity56			0
ironically , both sides of this struggle really want the same thing : an end to the corruption and economic stagnation blighting @entity3 since the collapse of the @entity149			1
amid the instability stirred up by @entity50 ’s machinations following the ousting of former president @entity154 , the economy has crashed and @entity3 ’s currency has lost two - fifths of its value			1
some see hope for salvation in the fledgling democracy in @entity51 – but others seek the old certainties of their @entity149 past			0
‘ i want to rejoin @entity53 for a better life with stability and a more competent government , ’ said @entity165 , a miner whose salary has fallen 60 per cent			1
‘ i used to be paid on time but these days i do not know if i will be paid at all			0
’ some pro-russians resent that wealth created by east @entity3 ’s mines and steel mills has been frittered away			2
‘ we give other regions so much money but they just look down at us like we are second - class citizens , ’ said @entity176 , a young mother volunteering as a medic on the @entity36 barricades			0
‘ the truth is we speak @entity53 , think @entity53 and even dream in @entity53			2
’ yet recent surveys found two - thirds of the country ’s @entity53 - speaking population want to remain in united @entity3 , while three - quarters say they do not feel under pressure because of their language			1
only 27 per cent favour unity with @entity53			2
‘ i have lived under @entity50 before , ’ one academic told me			0
‘ the last thing i want is to do it again and see my freedoms curtailed			0
’ on thursday night , the @entity3 fought back with a rally in a @entity85 park			2
politicians promised to ‘ eliminate the terrorists ’ in their midst as couples danced to folk music			0
afterwards , young men told me they were ready to die for their country – yet for all the impassioned bravado , there is naivety about their faith in the future , just as with their counterparts in @entity56			0
@entity3 is a weak nation run by an inexperienced interim government , with one of the world ’s best equipped armies massed on its border			1
when its decrepit forces fought back last week , six armoured personnel carriers were seized instantly by @entity33 militia			0
as the protest finished , news arrived of a deal to ‘ de-escalate ’ this volatile crisis following talks between @entity53 , @entity3 , the @entity223 and the @entity224 in @entity225			1
but within hours , it seemed to be falling apart			0
it is feared that the conflict could quickly escalate as a large number of @entity33 activists , such as these men pictured with black and orange ribbons , are heavily armed on friday morning , i passed through more barricades , noticing the usual piles of @entity237 cocktails and anti-american posters , to a chaotic press conference in the captured regional government building			0
first speaker was a bearded man i had seen the previous day direct two busloads of supporters – some stinking of drink – to take over the airport after complaints @entity53 journalists were being barred entry			2
@entity250 , chairman of the self - declared @entity251 , said they would not leave the building as agreed under the deal until the ‘ illegal ’ government in @entity51 quit			0
@entity92 ’s popularity has surged during this crisis , despite economic wobbles			1
this pugnacious president has never hidden his desire to restore @entity53 hegemony over the @entity263 states			2
in 1999 , in his first speech as prime minister , he said @entity53 was a great power with ‘ legitimate zones of interest ’ in former @entity149 lands			2
now we have a new @entity271 with the first annexation of territory in @entity274 since 1945 , followed by stirring of revolt in eastern @entity3			2
this armoured vehicle patrolling @entity36 , eastern @entity3 is under the control of @entity33 activists @entity92 has devised a new form of warfare fought with blatant lies , balaclava - clad stooges and a barrage of propaganda			1
the key question is whether a weak and divided @entity65 will prevent this expansionism or just abandon the people of eastern @entity3 as they did in @entity56			1
and then whether another nation – perhaps even a member of @entity66 – might be targeted next			0
‘ this all began when we asked to join @entity274 , ’ said @entity290 , a young engineer i met at the @entity3 rally			2
‘ in return , @entity274 talks tough but will do nothing to help at our time of need			0
’ it was hard to disagree , watching as his homeland slides once again towards @entity53 subservience .			2

pro-russian forces in @entity3 claim ' there will be war ' with the @entity65
one solider claimed ' @entity65 has invested too much in @entity3 '
@entity92 claims his government is not behind the current crisis
@entity53 troops moved to @entity3 border as ' precautionary ' measure
