@entity0 has claimed that he drove off the track to avoid sustaining tyre damage in sunday ’s @entity4 @entity3 amid conspiracy theorists believing the race was fixed by @entity7			1
@entity8 claimed his first win since july to narrow the gap to @entity0 in this most intense of title battles			2
but his cause was aided when his team - mate @entity0 missed the chicane at @entity15 which allowed @entity8 to pass			1
it was claimed by fans on social media that the @entity19 , who had made a similar error earlier in the race , performed the faux pas on purpose to compensate for his collision with @entity8 at the previous race in @entity28			1
he said : ‘ i thought , “ hello , what ’s going on here ? ” ’ he could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he did n’t			0
’ but speaking from @entity52 in the video blog after sunday ’s race , @entity0 , 22 points ahead of @entity8 in the championship , claimed he ran off the circuit under pressure from his team - mate			1
‘ i just messed up , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ @entity8 was quick and i had to step up my game a little bit and tried to get that little bit extra out of it and i messed up			0
‘ i could have made the corner but the risk is so big that my front tyre would be square from the lock up , so the safer way , and the best way , and the only way was to go straight on so at least i would not have to do another pit stop and change tyres			0
’ key moment : @entity0 took to the escape road allowing @entity8 to pass his @entity7 team - mate rivals : @entity8 narrowed the gap to @entity0 with six races of the season remaining off road : the @entity19 driver was fined a six - figure sum after his crash with @entity8 in @entity28 @entity7 dismissed the notion that they had asked @entity0 to move aside for @entity8 as punishment for the @entity19 's collision with his rival in @entity86			1
indeed they posted a satirical tweet accompanied with a picture of flying pigs ( below ) on monday morning			0
@entity7 boss @entity90 , who was seen smiling in the immediate aftermath of the incident on lap 29 , laughed off claims @entity0 was under orders to throw the race in @entity30			1
' only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea , ’ he said			0
' the race at @entity30 was unlike many others i 've seen with @entity0 because he rarely makes mistakes , but he made two in the same place , ' said @entity90			2
' there was lots of pressure on @entity0 because @entity8 was so quick in qualifying , and you could see that again in the race			1
' mentally he is very strong , and if you want to be a world champion you have to go through lows and highs , and he 's had many of them			0
' we saw after what happened at @entity118 ( retirement with a gearbox problem ) he came back , so i guess he has the mental strength to recover from what happened in @entity4			0
' @entity123 returns to winning ways			0
