@entity1 ' dinners by @entity2 & @entity3 how many cookery books do you have ? lots ? more than lots ? an absolutely ridiculous number ? power - hungry : @entity11 tyrant @entity10 the problem is that there ’s always one more that you have to have , even when you think you have collected the set			1
dictators ’ dinners is subtitled a bad taste guide to entertaining tyrants , and if there ’s even the smallest chance of you having to feed @entity22 or @entity23 one evening , you are going to need it on your shelf			1
@entity2 and @entity3 have approached their task with great clarity and simplicity			1
they profile 26 dictators , all from the 20th century , from @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity33 , to @entity34 in the @entity35 and ‘ @entity36 in the @entity37			1
they describe their culinary preferences , and then give us the recipe for one of their favourite dishes			1
rarely , if ever , have the depths of human depravity and haute cuisine been so stylishly combined in a single book			1
@entity49 enjoyed long , severely alcoholic meals : when he referred to ‘ a bite to eat ’ , he was usually talking about a six - hour feast , cooked by his favourite chef , @entity55 ’s grandfather			1
after one such snack , @entity56 vomited in his jacket sleeve ; after another , @entity59 was discovered to have wet his bed			2
@entity31 was , as we know , a vegetarian , but more because he had a tender concern for animals than because he did n’t like the taste			1
on several occasions in the @entity67 , he wolfed down fledgling pigeon stuffed with tongue , liver and pistachio nuts , and reportedly remarked that there was ‘ nothing better than a liver dumpling ’			2
he had 15 food - tasters , and only if none of them had dropped dead within 45 minutes of tasting a dish was it deemed safe for the @entity79			1
he must have eaten a lot of lukewarm food			2
how did paella become @entity84 ’s national dish ? because it was thought to be @entity87 ’s favourite , so no @entity89 restaurant could afford to leave it off the menu , just in case he popped in for lunch			1
@entity95 travelled with a mobile laboratory to analyse any food he was offered			2
if it had n’t been screened and approved , he shovelled everything he was served at formal banquets straight on to the floor and kicked it as far away from him as possible			2
@entity102 had 20 palaces , and kitchen staff at each of them prepared three meals a day for him whether he was there or not			1
he had his eldest son beaten up and thrown in jail for clubbing one of his food ‑ tasters to death			2
his usual breakfast was camel milk with bread and honey			2
after @entity102 was captured in 2003 , a nearly empty box of @entity120 bars was found in his hideout			0
colonel @entity122 liked camel milk , too , but it may have been the cause of his legendary flatulence			0
on a visit to his tent in 2004 , @entity124 was advised not to accept a glass , lest he be similarly afflicted			0
@entity128 of @entity129 favoured mopane worms , the large caterpillars of the emperor moth , especially when dried and eaten as a snack like crisps			0
both @entity135 of the @entity136 and @entity10 of @entity11 were rumoured to eat human flesh			0
@entity10 denied it : ‘ it ’s too salty for me			0
’ instead he ate up to 40 oranges a day			0
one state banquet he hosted included bee larvae , green bush crickets , cicadas , flying ants and locusts			0
( wash your crickets thoroughly and fry them with a little onion and garlic , with salt and pepper to taste			0
) @entity153 was a chronic insomniac who regularly took sleeping pills before dinner and fell asleep while he was eating , leaving attendants to fish any remaining food from his mouth			0
@entity162 ’s shoe - crazed wife @entity161 , flying to @entity163 in their private plane , ordered the pilot to turn back because they had forgotten to bring cheese			0
according to his sushi chef , @entity177 ’s @entity176 ‘ enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing ’			1
maybe the most serious foodie dictator , though , was @entity179 , who was extolling the virtues of plain , fresh ingredients decades before @entity182 was born			0
his favourite soup involved a plain , fresh , endangered species — the sea turtle			1
@entity187 and @entity188 reproduce the recipe here but , happily , leave the turtle out of it			1
their magnificent book is alternately mouth - watering and stomach - turning			0
i wonder what ’s for dinner ?			0
