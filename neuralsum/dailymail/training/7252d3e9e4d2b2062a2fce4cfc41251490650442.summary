robots already live amongst us , but should they have the same rights as humans and should we be allowed to torture them ? they may sound like questions from science fiction films but these are the kinds of question that will need to be answered in the not too distant future			1
@entity12 reports that @entity13 , a researcher at @entity14 , is truly fond of experimenting and is n't afraid to do terrible things to silly robots			1
but remember , it 's only a robot ! robot ethics : @entity13 ( pictured ) , a researcher at @entity14 asks as we form such strong emotional bonds with machines that people can ¿ t be cruel to them even though they know they are not alive			1
so should robots have rights ? he 's smiling and he loves you : watching @entity32 the dinosaur being tortured prompts strong physiological and emotional reactions in people as a part of her psychology experiment , @entity13 offered people to play with a @entity32 robot , a toy dinosaur for children			1
the cute soft @entity32 has trusting eyes and affectionate movements			0
when you take it out of the pack , it is like a newborn puppy – it ca n’t walk and you have to teach it everything			0
but after an hour of hugs and affection , @entity13 changes her tune			0
she gives the participants knives , hatchets and other weapons , and orders to torture and dismember their toys			1
what happens next ' is much more dramatic than we ever anticipated , ' she says			0
most of the participants refused to go along with her orders			0
under the surface : perhaps if @entity32 didn ¿ t have its soft skin , might it be easier to see the bot as the machine it is , made up of metal , wires and bits of plastic ? @entity13 : @entity13 asked people to play with a @entity32 robot , a child ¿ s toy dinosaur			1
the soft green @entity32 has trusting eyes and affectionate movements			0
when you take one out of the box , it acts like a helpless newborn puppy for @entity13 , our reaction to robot cruelty is important because a new wave of machines is forcing us to reconsider our relationship with them			2
when @entity13 described her @entity32 experiment at a lecture , she made the case that mistreating certain kinds of robots could soon become unacceptable and abusive in the eyes of society			2
she even believes that we may need a set of ' robot rights '			2
until not long ago , the idea of robot rights had been left to the science fiction writers			1
perhaps that ’s because the machines around us have been unsophisticated			0
nobody feels anxious about throwing away a toaster or a remote - control toy car , the situation changes when it comes to modern so - called ' social robots '			2
they display autonomous behavior , show interest and act familiar to pets or babies , as if they are alive , which triggers our emotions , and often we ca n’t help it , adds @entity13			1
emotional : after an hour allowing people to tickle and cuddle these loveable dinosaurs , @entity13 turned executioner			0
she gave the participants knives , hatchets and other weapons , and ordered them to torture and dismember their toys partners : it 's easy to become attached to robots that appear to have human - like qualities playing to your emotions : in an experiment where children held a @entity136 upside down , even children couldn ¿ t stand the way it was programmed to cry and say ' me scared ' in an experiment conducted in 2011 , children were asked to hold upside down a @entity143 doll , a hamster and a @entity136 toy for as long as they felt comfortable			1
while the children held the doll upside down until their arms got tired , they soon stopped torturing the wriggling hamster , and after a little while , the @entity136 too			1
they were old enough to know the @entity136 was a toy , but could n’t stand the way it was programmed to cry and say ' me scared '			0
some people give names to their vacuum cleaners , says @entity13			0
soldiers honor their robots with ' medals ' or hold funerals for them			2
she cites one particularly striking example of a military robot who was created in order to defuse landmines by stepping on them			2
cause for concern ? robots may appear to have human - like qualities , but could you ever bring it upon yourself to physically torture them ? what a cute dog ! until recently , the idea of robot rights had been left to the realms of science fiction			1
perhaps that ¿ s because the real machines surrounding us have been relatively unsophisticated number five is alive ! 27 years after @entity182 came out , researchers are converging on the idea that if a robot looks like it is alive , we feel empathy towards them , even though we know they are artificial in a test , the explosions ripped off most of the robot ’s legs , and yet the crippled machine continued to limp along			1
watching the robot struggle , the colonel in charge called off the test because it was ' inhumane '			2
another experiment was conducted by the researchers from the @entity199 in @entity200			0
they used machines to track people ’s reactions to a video of somebody torturing a robotic pet – choking it , putting it inside a plastic bag or striking it			0
the physiological and emotional responses they measured were much stronger than expected , although they were aware of watching a robot .			0

@entity14 researcher asks if we become attached to our robots , can we avoid having human emotions towards them ?
experiments involved torturing toys after letting children play with them
the kids found it *incredibly* *difficult* to *destroy* the toys as they became attached even after a short time
researchers are converging on the idea that if a robot looks like it is alive , we feel empathy towards them , even though we know they are artificial
