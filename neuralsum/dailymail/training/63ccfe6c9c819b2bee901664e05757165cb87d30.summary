by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 21:16 est , 7 january 2013 dr @entity1 pictured before his sex change @entity4 's first transsexual doctor is under investigation after one of his female patients said she regretted the treatment she underwent to become a man			1
the woman had her breasts removed and underwent gender - changing hormone treatment before changing her mind			2
she is now one of three patients to complain about dr @entity1 , a former woman , who is accused of allowing them to rush into sex - change procedures			1
the doctor , who charges patients up to £ 240 an hour , is being investigated by the @entity20			2
dr @entity1 , 46 , became the first transsexual to be re-registered by the @entity20 and now runs the @entity23 , a private sex - change practice			1
based in @entity25 , @entity26 , it is billed as a ‘ one - stop shop ’ , and patients seeking to change gender are charged £ 240 for an initial consultation , lasting an hour , and £ 130 for half - hour follow - ups			2
but dr @entity1 faces claims of breaching rules by prescribing sex - change treatments ‘ inappropriately ’			1
the allegations include commencing hormone treatment in complex cases without referring the patient for a second opinion , or before they had undergone counselling			2
he also allegedly administered hormone treatment at a patient ’s first appointment , and referred patients for surgery before they had lived in their desired gender role for a year , as international guidelines recommend			2
one patient allegedly underwent surgery within 12 months of their first appointment			2
he is also accused of administering hormones to patients aged under 18 without an adequate assessment			0
one of the most serious complaints concerns a woman who now regrets embarking on the switc to become male			0
she had the double mastectomy , but never completed her ‘ gender reassignment ’			0
concerns about dr @entity1 led to the @entity20 imposing a number of conditions on his practice in november 2011			1
before : as @entity65 before her sex - change ( left ) and aged seven ( right ) investigation : the @entity20 , headquarters pictured , stepped in after a series of complaints about dr @entity1 these included a ban on prescribing hormonal treatments for potential sex - change patients , and on referring any patients for sex - change surgery , unless those patients have undergone a recent psychological assessment			1
dr @entity1 is accused of breaching some of the conditions			1
if the @entity20 decides he has a case to answer , he will be referred to a fitness - to - practise committee , which can strike a doctor from the medical register			0
he was born @entity84 , to an @entity86 mother and a @entity88 miner father who came to @entity4 after the @entity89			0
as @entity65 , she grew up in @entity90 , @entity91 , with younger twin brothers			0
she studied medicine at @entity95 ’s @entity94 , @entity26 , and became a gp in 1995 , working at surgeries in @entity26			0
but feeling she was ‘ a gay man trapped in a woman ’s body ’ , she underwent two years of ‘ gender - specific ’ counselling before having sex - change surgery in 2005 and becoming dr @entity1			1
she started with a £ 7,000 hysterectomy and had a double mastectomy six months later			0
as a man , he also took testosterone to lower his voice			0
although dr @entity1 , who lives in @entity109 , @entity110 , has never married , he had three serious heterosexual relationships in his past life as @entity65 , which he described as ‘ emotionally and physically poor ’			1
he is a keen sailor who won several races as a woman			0
his mother @entity116 died before he underwent the sex - change , but his father @entity118 , then 80 , was supportive			1
dr @entity1 said : ‘ he said that after having been in a forced labour camp under the @entity121 when he was 16 , nothing could really get to him			1
‘ he said , “ oh yes			0
i thought you sounded different the last time we spoke			0
it ’s one of those things luvvie ”			0
’ yesterday neither dr @entity1 nor the @entity126 , which is representing him , wished to comment , citing ‘ the ongoing investigation and his duty to patient confidentiality ’			1
there is a @entity133 page supporting him entitled ‘ dr @entity1 is @entity134 ’ , which says he has ‘ helped many people with gender issues ’			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
