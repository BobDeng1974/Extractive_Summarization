an eye - catching two - toned lobster called @entity2 has become even more striking after moulting to reveal electric blue skin down one side of his body he is the star attraction of the aquarium and it ’s easy to see why			1
an eye - catching two - toned lobster called @entity2 has become even more striking after moulting to reveal electric blue skin down one side of his body			1
the strangely pigmented creature was captured near @entity15 in @entity16 in 2010 and has been looked after by curious staff who have since monitored his colourful transition at @entity19			1
the chances of a lobster being two separate colours on each half of its body is around one in 50million and @entity2 is arguably even rarer as his claws are the opposite colours to the corresponding sides of his body , making him look like he has been divided into four			1
he is named after the comic servants called harlequins , who wore brightly coloured suits			0
the sea creature amazed experts when it was caught in 2010 with a yellow , red and black body , buts its unusual appearance has intensified with each moult			1
@entity2 , who is thought to be five or six years old , has now shed his unique armour for the second time since his arrival at the centre and his keepers were delighted to see his new suit is his most spectacular yet			2
‘ whereas he was a reddish - black on one side and sandy colour on the other , he has now adopted a deep electric blue down one side , ' said @entity51 , of the centre			1
lobsters shed their hard shells as they outgrow them and need a quiet safe haven for a few days while a new larger shell develops and hardens			0
a-moulting - mazing : the sea creature had surprised experts after it was caught in 2010 with a yellow , red and black body , buts its unusual appearance has intensified with each moult and it now has electric blue colouring			1
the lobster named @entity2 is pictured centre , with his two old coats , which have been carefully preserved the lobster ’s colour combination is rarer than one in 50million			1
research suggests that one in every two million lobsters is pure blue , one in 30million is yellow and one in 100million is albino the lobster is divided into two colours by a straight line down his carapace because of a genetic mutation			1
the two sides of the creature developed independently with one half having none of the blue colouring , crustacyanin			1
selection for the animal pigmentation starts at the first cell division of the embryo so genes from one pigment went to one cells and the others to another , resulting in its half - and - half appearance			0
it is thought @entity2 has blue colouring because of another mutation			1
research by the @entity98 discovered that the genetic defect that makes lobsters blue in colour is the presence of too much protein			2
experts believe that the protein together with a red carotenoid molecule combine to create the striking colour			0
the colouring of most young lobsters intensifies every time they moult and a spokesman for the centre told @entity113 : ‘ the process is much the same with normal lobsters but i ’ve never seen one that 's half and half with a weird transfer of colour on its claws – he looks like an old fashioned harlequin jester			2
’ ' the line down his back is dead straight			0
it ’s almost as if someone has used a ruler and he was designed by a draftsman			0
’ the lobster ’s two - toned colouring is the result of a genetic mutation			2
the two sides of the creature developed independently with one half lacking the blue colouring , crustacyanin			1
@entity141 of the @entity142 at the @entity143 told @entity144 : ‘ selection for pigmentation starts at the first cell division of the embryo			0
genes from one pigment went to one cell while the others went to the other			0
all subsequent divisions carry the same information			0
’ the centre ’s spokesman explained that the aquarium has been home to albino lobsters in the past but the blue colour is also very rare			2
whiter shade of pale : an albino lobster named @entity165 was discovered off the coast of @entity167 , @entity168			0
only three albino lobsters have been found in britain in the last 20 years research by the @entity98 discovered that the genetic defect that makes lobsters blue in colour is the presence of too much protein			2
experts believe that the protein combines with a red carotenoid molecule to create the striking colour			0
ms @entity51 said : ‘ he 's such a striking individual he did extremely well to avoid predators like conger eels and seals when he was in the open sea			0
now safe from attack , he could live another sixty or seventy years			0
‘ there have been unusual coloured lobsters found in the past but he is remarkable because he has two colours separated by a near perfect straight line along the back of his carapace			0
’ while @entity2 might be different to the other lobsters , he acts in the same way and ‘ does n’t know he ’s different , ’ according to the centre 's spokesman			2
lucky escape : a red lobster called @entity201 ( pictured right ) was saved from the pot in 2010 at @entity204 fish market , @entity205			1
research suggests that one in every two million lobsters is pure blue , ( left ) one in 30million is yellow and one in 100million is albino			1
but red is so rare that it could be one in a billion			0

the strangely pigmented creature , which lives at @entity19 has moulted for a second time to reveal its electric blue colouring
he was captured in 2010 near @entity15 in @entity16 and his colour has intensified since
the lobster 's markings and colouring are a result of genetic mutations and the chances of finding one like him are one in 50million
@entity2 's colouring is rarer than a pure blue or yellow lobster , but more common than an albino or brilliant red lobster
