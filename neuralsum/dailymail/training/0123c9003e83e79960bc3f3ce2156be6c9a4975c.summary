@entity8 has explained that , so far , no @entity4 troops have been committed to the crisis in northern @entity11 but has not ruled out the possibility			1
' @entity4 can not leave the @entity11 people to face this horror , this pure evil , alone , ' mr @entity8 said			2
' the next stage will include the air - lift of of supplies ' including military equipment ' to the @entity41 military			1
' this involvement has been at the request of the @entity23 administration , ' mr @entity8 confirmed			0
' so far we have met requests for humanitarian relief and for logistical support			0
' there has been no request for military action itself			2
should such a request come it would be considered against these criteria			0
' is there a clear and achievable overall objective ? is there a clear and proportionate role for @entity4 forces ? have all the risks been property assessed and is there an overall humanitarian objective in accordance with @entity4 's national interests ?			2
' mr @entity8 went on to say that ' @entity4 has no intention to commit combat troops on the ground but we are not inclined to stand by in the face of preventable genocide either '			0

' at least 60 @entity4 are fighting with terrorist groups across @entity11 and @entity79			1
they are supported by about 100 more and we know , or should assume that many of them will seek to return to @entity4 ' they will return accustomed to kill			1
' the @entity4 and their supporters who have joined terrorist groups in the @entity85 are a serious and growing threat to our security			1
' they have come to hate us no less than they hate their victims in @entity11 and @entity79			0

if that request is made for ground forces , an assessment against a list of objectives and criteria would be made
