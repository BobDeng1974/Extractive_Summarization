by @entity0 published : 16:19 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 28 october 2013 @entity1 have announced they are canceling planned performances in @entity3 and @entity4 as bassist @entity5 is treated for cancer			1
band members @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 released a statement today in which they apologies to fans who had bought tickets			1
but they said they hoped ' fans everywhere will join us in wishing @entity5 and his family all the best			1
' band spokeswoman @entity19 did not specify what type of cancer @entity5 is being treated for and it is not known how serious his condition is			1
@entity23 : band members @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 said in a statement they were sorry to cancel the 14 show dates but that @entity5 , far left , and his treatment came first @entity1 recently finished a @entity28 tour which included packed out performances in @entity30 where they were joined by former members @entity33 and @entity5 's ex wife @entity34			1
the @entity4 and @entity3 shows were similarly eagerly anticipated and scheduled to run until dec 7			0
the @entity38 - @entity37 band were formed in 1967 in @entity30 and @entity9 and then boyfriend @entity10 joined the line up in 1975			1
wished the best : bandmates said they hoped fans would join them in wishing @entity5 all the best as he undergoes treatment their album rumours sold 40million and topped the @entity46 chart for seven months - until @entity47 released @entity48 it was the best - selling album of all time			1
but their stardom was blighted by drink and drug - fuelled excesses and tragedy			2
former guitarist @entity55 became and alcholic by the age of 22 , developed mental health problems after he was sacked from the band for his increasingly erratic behaviour , and eventually became homeless on the streets of @entity30			2
in 2012 band member @entity61 , 66 , was found dead by his wife after writing a suicide note and shooting himself in the chest			2
he had had spinal surgery three months previously and been told by doctors that he would not regain the use of his legs - he opted to kill himself rather than become a ' burden ' to his wife @entity70			2
and sadly though the band 's longevity has led to the release of classics such as @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 the infighting , partner - swapping and drug - taking of the @entity1 ' family ' has rarely been out of the headlines			1
and the phenomena which @entity10 dubbed ' @entity84 of the @entity1 guitarist ’ started back in the late @entity86			0
indeed @entity61 's tragic death was preceded by another former @entity1 guitarist just six months earlier when @entity89 was found dead in his bed in his @entity30 flat from a haemorrhage aged just 64			0
@entity33 founded @entity1 as a blues band in @entity30 in 1967 but by the time the band released its fourth album he had become dependent on lsd			0
he also he grew a beard , began to wear robes and a crucifix and told the band ’s manager he was @entity101			0
he left the band in 1970 after rowing with drummer @entity8 who refused his request to donate all their royalties to charity following a drug - induced vision he had of an angel			2
he was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered financial problems which led to him working as a hospital porter and even a grave digger			0
still drawing the crowds : after a staggering 15 different changes the reunited @entity1 remain popular across the generations and played to sold out crowds at the @entity118 last month way back when : @entity1 pictured in 1982 , left to right @entity10 , @entity34 , @entity8 , @entity119 and @entity5 in 1977 , police surrounded his house and he was arrested for threatening the band ’s accountant , @entity122 , with a shotgun			1
bizarrely , the reason @entity33 gave was that he was furious because @entity122 kept sending him royalty cheques			0
another notoriously wild founder member @entity127 took a turn for the worse during a tour if the @entity46 in 1971 after taking the drug mescaline			0
he later joined the @entity131 , a sinister cult which used sex to ‘ show @entity136 ’s love ’ and win converts and refused to perform with the band again			0
after an astonishing 15 different personnel line - ups the bands recent reunion tours and the healing of old wounds appeared to have brought them success again prior to the news of @entity5 's diagnosis			1
the band is still believed to be scheduled to perform in @entity147 on dec 30 but no announcement has yet been made about whether this will take place .			0

14 tour dates cancelled
but band - mates apologise and ask fans to send their ' best ' to @entity5 as he undergoes treatment
