currently , around one in 100 children develops autism boys who have induced births are a third more vulnerable to autism , according to research			1
around one in five deliveries in the @entity9 is assisted , where drugs such as oxytocin are used to trigger labour			1
researchers in the @entity15 analysed 625,042 live births linked with school records , including 5,500 children classified with autism			1
babies whose births are assisted by induction or speeded up by drugs have a higher risk of developing autism , claim researchers girls were found to be at a smaller increased risk where medication is used to enhance contractions			1
but @entity9 experts defended induction saying its use outweighed potentially fatal complications			1
currently , around one in 100 children develops autism but symptoms do not usually become apparent until the second year of life			1
autistic spectrum disorder ( @entity40 ) affects an estimated 600,000 children and adults in the @entity9			1
researchers at @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , found the risk of autism in boys is between 15 per cent and 35 per cent higher			2
but the chances of an assisted birth child developing autism remain very low , said their report in journal @entity55			2
two in 1,000 autism cases among boys whose mothers experienced induced or augmented labour could have been prevented , they found			0
@entity61 , of the @entity62 , said : ‘ autism is a complex condition and is thought to be the result of many different underlying physical and genetic factors			0
‘ it ’s therefore important that people do not jump to conclusions about this study and its implications			0
’ autism , or autistic spectrum disorder ( @entity40 ) , including @entity75 ’s syndrome , is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone ’s ability to interact socially and communicate			0
an estimated 600,000 children and adults in the @entity9 are affected by @entity40 and genetic factors play a role in its development			2
the study found induction or the use of drugs to affect the rate or strength of contractions ( known as augmented ) were linked with a higher risk of autism being diagnosed in childhood			2
researchers led by @entity98 of @entity44 , @entity45 , found the risk ‘ particularly pronounced ’ in male children			1
researchers in @entity46 analysed 625,042 live births linked with school records , including 5,500 children classified with autism , over an eight - year period ( stock picture ) the risk of autism in boy babies who had an induced or augmented labour is between 15 per cent and 35 per cent higher than for those who do not , the exact amount depending on whether the labour was induced , augmented or both			1
in the case of boys , both raised the risk of autism whether used together or individually			2
only augmentation alone was associated with an increased risk among girls			0
the study allowed for factors such as socioeconomic status , maternal health , pregnancy - related events and conditions , and birth year , says a report in the journal @entity55			2
but the actual chances of a child developing autism after assisted birth remain very low , said the researchers			2
researchers from @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 found the risk ' particularly pronounced ' in male children two in 1,000 autism cases among boys whose mothers experienced induced or augmented labour could have been prevented if their births were unassisted			1
further work is needed to investigate the reasons for the link , they said , but it does not justify changes in clinical practice			0
co-author dr @entity152 , also from @entity44 , said ‘ the findings of this study must be balanced with the fact that there are clear benefits associated with induction and augmentation of labour			0
‘ labour induction , especially for women with post-date pregnancies or medical conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure , has remarkably decreased the chance of stillbirth			0
’ prof @entity168 , professor of @entity169 at @entity170 , said there was evidence autism is linked with risk factors associated with ‘ a difficult birth ’			1
prof @entity168 , professor of @entity169 at the @entity170 but the effect of these risk factors is quite small - about 13 in 1000 boys in the study were recorded as having autism - and it is far from clear what is causing what , he added			1
‘ if , magically somehow , all the mothers of boys who had induction or augmentation could have not had it , while everything else remained the same , then the number of their children with autism diagnoses would reduce by only 2 in 1000			1
the association in girls is even weaker , too small to be of statistical significance ’ he said			0
prof @entity168 said ‘ maybe something else - some genetic factor , or something that occurred earlier in pregnancy or during the birth that the researchers could not take into account - is causing some babies to be more likely to have an induction of labour and separately making it more likely that they have autism			1
‘ we ca n’t just stop doing inductions or augmentations			0
as the researchers very clearly point out , there are very large benefits to the mother and to the baby in appropriate cases			0
‘ even if it turns out that we could save a few children from autism by inducing many fewer labours , that would come at a major cost in other complications , including deaths to mothers and babies			0
‘ there ’s certainly nothing here that pregnant women or new mothers should be particularly concerned about , in my view			0
the researchers make it explicit their work gives no reason to change medical practice , and i absolutely agree with them on that			0

boys third more at risk following a ‘ difficult ’ birth , according to @entity15 study
but @entity9 experts said ' risk small ' - accounting for *1/500* in assisted births
currently , around one in 100 children develops autism
