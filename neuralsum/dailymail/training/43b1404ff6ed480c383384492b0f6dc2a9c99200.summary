by @entity0 , defence correspondent published : 13:14 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 7 february 2013 @entity1 is planning to leave military equipment worth more than £ 2billion in @entity3 when it withdraws from the war			1
around 40 per cent of hardware - including up to 1,200 protected trucks and personnel carriers - will be scrapped , sold or given away by the @entity8			0
military chiefs are preparing to bring home 6,500 containers of kit from the frontline			2
but some 4,500 loads will remain in the warzone			1
@entity16 armoured vehicle on a test run at @entity18 , @entity3			1
this is one of the vehicles that may be left behind some equipment will be gifted to the @entity22 and @entity23 so they can maintain security when the @entity1 leaves in december 2014			1
other pieces of kit deemed surplus to requirement will be destroyed so it does not fall into the hands of insurgents			1
but the planning assumptions , revealed by the @entity8 , have fuelled concern that sensitive equipment could inadvertently fall into the @entity36 's clutches			1
dr @entity37 , of the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) defence think - tank , said : ' what is benevolent today could be quite nasty tomorrow			0
the typical danger is that people who are n't your friend could somehow end up with it and use it			0
' there could also be technical issues			0
there could be some very interesting technology in the kit that , if you thought about it , you would n't want a third party to get			0
' @entity36 guerrilla fighters hold their weapons at a secret base in eastern @entity3			1
there are fears that the weapons to end up in the hands of terrorists @entity63 , a security strategist at foreign affairs think - tank @entity64 , said : ' there will always be a risk that something with a @entity70 serial number will get passed across [ to the enemy ]			2
' shadow defence secretary @entity72 said : ' in an uncertain world it is essential that the @entity1 retains much of the equipment deployed in @entity3			1
' the @entity1 's military needs must be the priority but we must consider how we can best support @entity3 forces who have a long - term challenge to secure lasting peace			1
' defence chiefs have not disclosed the type or value of equipment it will bring home			2
the @entity89 , however , has been told the overall cost of kit left on the battlefield is expected to be at least £ 2billion			0
the decision is likely to prove controversial as the @entity94 are being forced to make drastic cuts to save money and tackle a £ 38billion black hole in the equipment budget			0
the cost of transporting ' low - grade ' equipment and supplies back to the @entity1 will be up to £ 12,000 per 20ft - long container , say the @entity8 for vehicles and sensitive material it will rise to £ 30,000 per load			1
of the 1,900 protected vehicles being used by the @entity22 in southern @entity3 , the @entity89 understands only 700 vehicles have been listed for ' recovery '			2
they are mainly the latest and most heavily armoured , such as @entity16 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
defence secretary @entity113 insists that it bringing some equipment back to the @entity1 will not be good ' value for money '			1
among the most prized vehicles that will be left behind are wolfhound personnel carriers , some @entity119 , a weapons - mounted armoured patrol vehicle , and a small number of heavily - protected @entity124 all - terrain vehicles			0
defence secretary @entity113 said : ' we will only bring back equipment that we need as part of our equipment plan			0
' there will be a value for money case on each individual line of equipment ' where equipment does not represent value for money , after taking into account the cost of getting it back from theatre and then refurbishing it into the core equipment plan , it will not be brought back ; it will either be sold , gifted or destroyed			2
' we will look at all the options for equipment that is not required			0
' is it useful to the @entity3 ? is it sustainable by the @entity3 ? can we afford to gift it to the @entity3 ? is there a sale route for it ? is it something that we can sensibly attempt to sell ? we will make a case - by - case judgment			2
' an @entity8 spokesman said : ' before gifting any equipment we must determine that the @entity22 can sustain this equipment in terms of cost of ownership , support and enduring training			0
' we want to ensure that our @entity3 partner forces receive the equipment they need without duplication or unnecessary complexity			1

4,500 containers of equipment will remain in @entity3 after the @entity1 army leaves
some fear that the weapons may fall into the hands of @entity36 guerrilla fighters
some equipment will be gifted to the @entity3 national army and @entity23
