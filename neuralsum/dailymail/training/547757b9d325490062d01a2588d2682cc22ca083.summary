by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:15 est , 22 july 2012 updated : 07:35 est , 23 july 2012 a statue honouring @entity4 football head coach @entity3 has been torn down as the university bows to massive public outcry			1
@entity4 ordered the removal of the statue of @entity10 coach early on sunday morning			2
workers lifted the statue off its base and used a forklift to move it into @entity15 early sunday as the 100 to 150 students watching chanted , ' we are @entity4			2
@entity3 , who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year at the height of the case the statue turned into a target for @entity3 â€™s critics after former fbi director @entity48 alleged a cover - up by @entity3 and others that allowed @entity40 to continue molesting boys			1
police and construction workers barricaded both sides of the street and the sidewalks near the statue			0
before and after : workers gutted the location of the @entity3 statue outside @entity15 on sunday morning removal : the @entity3 statue was surrounded by a fence and a tarp before it was taken down by construction workers on sunday a chain - link fence was also erected around the area and a tarp was raised that concealed most of the statue			2
in a statement released later on sunday morning , the @entity3 family said : ' tearing down the statue of @entity3 does not serve the victims of @entity40 's horrible crimes or help heal the @entity74			1
we believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth			0
' statue : the bronze sculpture bearing @entity3 's likeness has been sitting in front of @entity15 since 2001 the family also chided the media for what they called one - sided reporting on a document that @entity3 is unable to defend himself against			1
the @entity48 report , though it has been accepted by the media as the definitive conclusion on the @entity40 scandal , is the equivalent of an indictment - a charging document written by a prosecutor - and an incomplete and unofficial one at that			0
' to those who truly want to know the truth about @entity40 , it should matter that @entity3 has never had a hearing ; that his legal counsel has never been able to interview key witnesses , all of whom are represented by lawyers and therefore unavailable ; that there has never been an opportunity to review critical evidence which has not been made public ; that selective evidence and the opinion of mr @entity48 is treated as the equivalent of a fair trial			1
' the statement went on : ' despite this obviously flawed and one - sided presentation , the @entity113 believes it must acquiesce and accept that @entity3 has been given a fair and complete hearing			0
we think the better course would have been for the @entity113 to take a strong stand in support of due process so that the complete truth can be uncovered			0
' construction vehicles and police arrived shortly after dawn sunday , barricading the street and sidewalks near the statue , erecting a chain - link fence then concealing the statue with a blue tarp			0
@entity4 president @entity131 said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because it ' has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing			0
' ' i believe that , were it to remain , the statue will be a recurring wound to the multitude of individuals across the nation and beyond who have been the victims of child abuse , ' @entity131 said in a statement released at 7am on sunday			2
reaction : some students and @entity30 residents could not contain their emotions as they saw @entity15 without the statue down and out : @entity4 president @entity131 said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because it ' has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing ' he said @entity3 's name will remain on the campus library because it ' symbolizes the substantial and lasting contributions to the academic life and educational excellence that the @entity3 family has made to @entity113			1
' last week , a plane was spotted over @entity30 towing a banner that read ' take the @entity168			0
' also last week , the group that runs the parking area dubbed ' @entity171 , ' where students camp out for tickets before games , stripped that title and changed the name to ' @entity177			0
' demands : the banner referred to a monument to @entity3 , who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year the @entity4 student group that manages the newly - renamed fan area said that their decision would help ' return the focus to the overall team and the thousands of students who support it			1
' but that may soon be a moot point , as the @entity192 has said it is n't ruling out the possibility of shutting down the entire @entity4 football programme in light of the @entity40 case			1
the @entity192 will announce a punishment against @entity4 and its football programme tomorrow morning			1
a source told @entity200 that the penalties against the university will be ' unprecedented			0
' getting rid of all traces : since a scathing report which detailed how much former football coach @entity3 ( pictured ) knew about the child sex scandal , his name is being pulled from much of the school the bronze sculpture outside @entity15 has been a rallying point for students and alumni outraged over @entity3 's firing four days after @entity40 's november 5 arrest - and grief - stricken over the @entity10 coach 's jan. 22 death at age 85			1
but it turned into a target for critics after the @entity48 report 's stunning allegation of a cover - up by @entity3 , ousted president @entity222 and two @entity4 officials , athletic director @entity224 and vice president @entity225			1
their failure to report @entity40 to child - welfare authorities in 2001 allowed him to continue molesting boys , the report found			2
the statue has been sitting in front of the stadium since 2001			0
