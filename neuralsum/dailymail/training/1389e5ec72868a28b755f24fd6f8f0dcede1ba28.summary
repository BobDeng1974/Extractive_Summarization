after university i started an internship at @entity3 , where i was surrounded by beautiful women , and was lucky enough to be promoted to picture editor even though i had no experience in photography			2
but i was frustrated because after a few gap years travelling , i wanted more adventure			2
one morning in 2000 , i opened a newspaper and there was a story about the @entity13 making the most daring tv show ever ... and i knew i had to be part of it			2
they wanted volunteers to be marooned on an island called @entity20 in the @entity21 for a year and i jumped at the chance to be a real - life @entity23			1
@entity25 jumped at the chance to take part in a reality show called @entity29 in which he was marooned on an island in the @entity21 for a year the series was called @entity29 and it was one of the very first reality shows			1
there were 36 castaways in all , including families with young children and singles like me , and we were allowed to take one luxury , so i chose a black @entity43 puppy called @entity44			0
everyone else seemed to have a life skill that would help us to be self - sufficient on an island for a whole year			1
we had a farmer , a butcher , a doctor , a teacher , and i had a second - rate degree in latin american studies and could speak a bit of @entity55 ! but i 've always been a bit of a peacemaker , and i like to think i tried to bond the group together			0
i was also a hard grafter and willing to get my hands dirty			0
when we first arrived we had to cut tons of turf to put on the pods that we lived in , and roll out water pipes , plant crops , and milk cows			0
we also had to slaughter pigs and sheep , and on my first attempt at wringing a chicken 's neck i could n't do it and ended up in tears			0
before i went to the island i was very shy and insecure in myself			0
being there gave me this confidence that i 'd achieved something that not everyone else in the world had done			0
@entity25 says that his trip to @entity20 was a steep learning curve into the realities of life and the importance of green issues that year on @entity20 opened my eyes to so much more than just an opportunity to be part of the world of television			1
it was a steep learning curve into the realities of life and the importance of green issues			2
@entity20 meant so much to me that i took my wife @entity95 there for our honeymoon and my dream is still to move to an island like that with my family one day			1
when it came up for sale two years ago i raised £ 2½ million to buy it , but unfortunately it had been sold			0
when i left , i made the most of the following year , going to @entity108 to report on the civil war for @entity110 and signing my first book deal , which took me to @entity113 's most remote overseas territories including @entity114 and @entity115			2
and since then i 've had many life - changing adventures filmed for tv , including racing across the @entity119 , swimming from @entity120 to @entity121 and rowing the @entity122 with @entity124 @entity123 , during which i nearly met my maker			1
if i had n't gone to @entity20 , i do n't believe i 'd have gone into television , or be married to my wife – i met @entity95 while walking @entity44 in the park			1
and none of it would have happened if i had n't opened the newspaper that day			0
@entity25 has launched @entity25 's @entity133 , a series of shore excursions with @entity136			1

@entity25 volunteered to appear on a tv programme @entity29
he was marooned in @entity20 for a year alone
he says that the experience changed his life forever
