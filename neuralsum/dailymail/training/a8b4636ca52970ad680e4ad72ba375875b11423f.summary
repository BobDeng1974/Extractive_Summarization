by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are in line to host the @entity4 before @entity5 even come under consideration			1
despite serial biter @entity7 shaming his country in @entity10 and president @entity11 calling the @entity13 hierarchy ‘ old sons of bitches ’ , @entity2 are favourites to host the finals in 2030			1
with the @entity18 already earmarked for 2026 , following @entity19 2018 and @entity20 , that makes 2034 the earliest possible date for @entity5 to have any hope of staging its second @entity4			1
video : scroll down to see @entity2 president calls @entity13 a ' bunch of old sons of whores ' reason to cheer : @entity2 are favourites to host the 2030 @entity4 something to smile about : @entity2 's 2014 campaign ended in an unsavoury manner on the rise : @entity18 have been earmarked to host the 2026 tournament @entity18 dream : @entity35 took the @entity18 to the last 16 where they lost to @entity38 in extra time tiny : @entity2 is dwarfed by neighbours @entity40 and @entity10 but with two other powerful candidates emerging for that year , the odds are lengthening against the finals coming here during most of our lifetimes			1
@entity13 are acutely aware that @entity2 have not staged the finals for almost a century , even though they have won the @entity4 twice and reached the semi-finals on three other occasions			2
the difficulty of taking the tournament back to the land of its inaugural hosts and winners — in 1930 — is that @entity2 is a small country with a population of only just over 3.3 million			0
that is where @entity40 come in			0
the concept is for @entity2 ’s neighbours to be co-hosts			0
although @entity13 have always expressed some resistance to joint hosting , a precedent was set by the 2002 tournament in @entity68 and @entity69			0
in fact , a successful two - nation event in @entity71 would be more bad news for @entity5			0
while the tournament is due to return to @entity75 20 years from now , fifa are conscious also that @entity76 , three - time finalists , have yet to hold the finals			2
disgrace : @entity7 's bite on @entity80 marred @entity2 's @entity4 campaign aftermath : @entity7 's actions earned him a lengthly ban from all football fresh start : @entity7 has arrived in @entity87 following his move to @entity89 attack : @entity11 has blasted the @entity13 hierarchy however , the emergence of @entity38 as a competitive nation encourages the prospect of those two neighbours being given the honour			2
@entity13 also await @entity97 , with its huge population and massive commercial market , declaring they are ready			0
the @entity4 ’s quadrennial global rotation is not set in stone and the economic power @entity102 could come into contention for 2034			0
if all three of the @entity18 , @entity76 - @entity38 and @entity97 are allocated different tournaments in the foreseeable future , @entity5 will be out of the running until the second half of this century			1
national pride : @entity18 fans painted their faces with stars and stripes during the @entity4 in @entity10 @entity115 man : @entity116 is asked to autograph a @entity18 flag by a fan man mountain : @entity18 keeper @entity120 earned rave reviews for his performances in @entity10 gathering momentum : crowds of @entity18 fans flocked to watch the @entity4 finals next up : @entity19 president @entity126 will welcome the 2018 @entity4 controversial : @entity13 's decision to award the @entity20 to @entity20 was greeted with widespread disapproval looking ahead : an artist 's impression of the @entity131 in @entity20			1

@entity18 set to host tournament in 2026 - *32* years after previous honour
@entity5 dealt blow with bid as @entity2 head the queue for finals
@entity40 could co-host 2030 with their neighbours
@entity19 and @entity20 have already secured the next two tournaments
