by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 19 april 2013 ' @entity1 is to blame ' : president @entity2 , a former @entity3 rebel himself , said ' any attempt to draw a connection ' between @entity3 and the brothers was ' futile ' @entity3 's @entity9 - backed president has hit out at @entity1 for killing one of the suspected @entity12 bombers and blamed the @entity1 for moulding them into terrorists			1
@entity3 - born @entity15 , 26 , died from gunshot wounds and possible blast injuries after a fierce gun battle rocked the @entity20 area of @entity21 hours after a police officer was shot dead at the nearby @entity24 campus			2
his 19 - year - old brother , @entity26 , fled the shoot out and is on the run , reportedly having strapped explosives to his body			0
but president @entity2 , a former @entity3 rebel himself , told @entity1 authorities that ' any attempt to draw a connection ' between @entity3 and the brothers was ' futile '			1
in a @entity9 - language statement on @entity36 , he added : ' they were raised in the @entity1 , and their attitudes and beliefs were formed there			1
' it is necessary to seek the roots of this evil in @entity1			2
' the whole world must struggle against terrorism — that we know better than anyone else			0
we hope for the recovery of all the victims , and we mourn with the @entity1			2
' @entity51 militants from @entity3 have a long history of unleashing devastating terror attacks on @entity9 – but the allegations of involvement in the @entity12 blasts would mark the first time they have targeted the @entity58			1
however , the @entity1 may have become a target for @entity3 terrorists in the wake of the harrowing @entity63 nearly ten years ago , an expert claimed today			1
the world watched in horror in 2004 as armed @entity51 separatist militants , some @entity3 , occupied a school in @entity68 , @entity69 , and killed more than 380 people			1
dr @entity77 , director of the @entity82 and @entity83 at the @entity84 , said : ' one of the few things in the past five or 10 years that has brought the @entity9 and the @entity1 closer together is the perceived threat from @entity51 terrorism			1
' he explained that the @entity68 crisis would have fostered a close collaboration between the @entity9 and the @entity58 through agencies such as the @entity91			1
@entity92 : @entity9 tv showed children and teachers cowering in fear in the gymnasium of the @entity68 school as armed @entity3 gunmen stand guard during the siege in 2004 fear : a gunman wires a bomb during the siege , images of which were beamed around the world			1
an expert today said the tragedy - which left 380 people dead - bridged a gap between the @entity1 and @entity9 by establishing a mutual threat - fundamental @entity51 terrorism blood on the floor : this tape was made by hostage takers showing what seemed to be the first hours of the three day school crisis that ended in bloodshed dr @entity77 went on : ' the @entity121 and fundamentalists would have been aware of the bridging of the gap between @entity9 and the @entity1			1
' if @entity3 want an easy target , why not fly to the @entity1 on a temporary visa and attack a prestige event			1
' if those two guys had carried out that attack in @entity131 , the repercussions would have been severe because the @entity9 state under ( president @entity134 ) @entity132 is not reluctant to go in hard			2
they would know that would n't happen in @entity1			2
' buried in the heart of @entity9 ’s @entity138 , the @entity51 state has fought against @entity9 rule for centuries			0
bloodshed : @entity9 special forces remove hostages from a theatre where over 40 , mostly female , @entity3 terrorists took more than 700 hostages prisoner at a @entity131 theatre bodies in the dark : and in january 2011 , a @entity3 suicide bomber unleashed terror on @entity131 's @entity151 when they blew themselves up killing 36 people but it culminated in a bloody and chaotic civil war with the @entity9 government that ended in 1994 and left tens of thousands dead and the region in ruins			1
as a result , the area became a hotbed for extremism , and was soon infiltrated by foreign @entity51 militants , including those with ties to @entity167			0
terrorists have since unleashed a string of attacks on @entity9 soil			0
while exact numbers are unclear , a small , but growing @entity3 community exists in the @entity1 , in particular in @entity174 and throughout @entity175			1
@entity1 intelligence has suggested drug trafficking has long financed the @entity3 separatist movement and its links to @entity51 groups			1
meanwhile @entity3 crime lords have increased their presence in @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 to facilitate the shipping of @entity188 cocaine to @entity189			0
they have also been linked to arms trafficking to @entity184 and @entity185 , and money laundering			0
@entity9 troops withdrew from @entity3 in 1996 after the first @entity3 war , leaving it de-facto independent and largely lawless , but then rolled back three years later following apartment building explosions in @entity131 and other cities blamed on the rebels			1
@entity3 has stabilized under the steely grip of @entity200 - backed local strongman @entity2 , a former rebel whose forces were accused of massive rights abuses			0
but the @entity51 insurgency has spread to neighboring provinces , with @entity205 , sandwiched between @entity3 and the @entity206 , becoming the epicenter of violence with militants launching daily attacks against police and other authorities			2
militants from @entity3 and neighboring provinces have launched a long series of terror attacks in @entity9 on october 23 2002 , over 40 , mostly female , terrorists took more than 700 hostages prisoner at a @entity131 theatre , demanding an end to the @entity9 presence in @entity3			1
dressed from head to toe in black hijabs , they became known as @entity225			0
but @entity9 security forces stormed the theatre , guns blazing , killing the hostage takers after releasing a toxic gas into the auditorium that killed more than 100 innocent theatre goers			0
the ' @entity233 ' responded by attempting to detonate homemade bombs strapped to their bodies , though most were shot dead before they could			0
then on september 1 2004 , a group of 32 heavily - armed , masked men seized control of @entity241 @entity240 and more than 1,000 hostages in @entity68 , @entity69			0
most of the hostages were children aged from six to sixteen years old			0
bombings : @entity9 troops withdrew from @entity3 in 1996 after the first @entity3 war , leaving it de-facto independent and largely lawless , but then rolled back three years later following apartment building explosions in @entity131 and other cities blamed on the rebels , such as this one in 1999 fight for independence : buried in the heart of @entity9 ¿ s @entity138 , the @entity51 state has fought against @entity9 rule for centuries after a tense two - day standoff , that was beamed around the world , @entity9 forces raided the building			2
following a violent , two - hour gunfight , the siege ended , leaving 331 civilians , 11 commandos and 31 hostage - takers dead			0
the rebels have since claimed responsibility for an array of terrorist attacks , including last year 's double suicide bombing of the @entity131 subway system that killed 40 people			0
in march 2010 , two women suicide bombers killed 40 commuters when they blew themselves up on two packed tube trains during the busy rush hour			0
and in january a year later , a @entity3 suicide bomber unleashed terror on @entity131 's @entity151 when they blew themselves up killing 36 people			0
in recent years , however , militants in @entity3 , @entity205 and other neighboring provinces have largely refrained from attacks outside the @entity138			2
the allegations of the @entity288 men 's role in the @entity21 's explosions would reinforce long - held claims by @entity9 officials that insurgents in the @entity288 have been linked to @entity167 .			2

suspects may have attacked @entity1 because of its relationship with @entity9
@entity3 militants have long history of attacking @entity9 , but never @entity58
