veterinarians have criticised @entity2 rules on organic farming that demands that fish are treated with homoeopathic remedies			2
in line with @entity2 regulations , the first line of treatment for organic fish should be ' substances from plants , animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution ' , before @entity17 and @entity18 vets have called the directives ' scientifically illiterate ' , saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to ' serious animal health and welfare detriment			1
' ' risk ' : under @entity2 regulations , organic farmers must first use ' substances from plants , animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution ' to treat ill fish , which has been criticised by @entity17 and @entity18 vets ( stock image ) the directives , outlined in the 2009 @entity34 regulation on organic aquaculture , are set to be brought into national law in @entity37 @entity18 , which has caused vets to see red			1
section 7 of the regulations calls for organic farmers to use ' substances from plants , animals or minerals in a homoeopathic dilution ' , as their first port of call when their fish are ill after this , the ' veterinary treatments ' section outlines that farmers may use ' plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects '			2
as well as the directive to use homeopathic treatments , organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year , or their fish will lose its organic certification			2
this has been criticised by the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) as could mean that fish are not getting the correct treatment in time , causing them unnecessary suffering			0
danger : @entity17 and @entity18 vets have called the @entity2 directives on organic fish treatment ' scientifically illiterate ' , saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to ' serious animal health and welfare detriment ' ' we think it 's totally unacceptable from a scientific point of view because there 's no scientific basis for using homeopathy , ' @entity77 , the head of the @entity64 , told @entity85			1
' if you start using homeopathy , you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that 's a threat to animal welfare			0
' @entity92 : farmers are only allowed to use mainstream medical treatments a twice per year , or their fish will lose its organic certification ( stock image ) the criticism from @entity18 has been echoed by the @entity99 , saying use of homeopathy could lead to ' serious animal health and welfare detriment			1
' the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) can not endorse the use of homeopathic remedies , or indeed any products , making therapeutic claims , which have no proven efficacy , ' @entity99 president @entity105 told @entity109			0
' as with any treatment for disease using medicines , @entity99 believes that veterinary medicinal products must be evidence - based , with any medicinal claims made by a manufacturer supported			0
' if homeopathic remedies are used without proven effectiveness on farmed fish across the @entity2 , including the @entity17 , the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment , which would be counterproductive to both animal health and to the farmed fish industry in the @entity17			1
' @entity123 treatments are based on the principle that ' like cures like ' , whereby a highly diluted substance that causes the symptoms in a healthy person , can also cure similar symptoms in a sick person			0
a 2010 @entity132 report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos , and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are ' scientifically implausible ' .			0
