' he continued : ' you were , in effect , together with the passengers on your coach , a sitting duck			0
' the judge said @entity11 , who has been driving coaches since 1976 , had shown a flagrant disregard for the rules of the road and the safety of other road users by failing to take action to avoid the collision			2

she said : ' the 26 april 2013 will be a date forever etched into memories of the close - knit community of @entity263 and it saw the commencement of a long and intricate investigation			2
' @entity11 was employed as a professional driver to take a group of ladies to @entity7 for what should have been a happy and enjoyable weekend			2
he failed in his duty that day			0
' he also failed to act when his passengers made him aware that there was a problem with the vehicle			2
the scene of the fatal accident in 2013 on the @entity12 where a @entity279 lorry went into the back of the coach ' the subsequent collision the bus was involved in resulted in the death of @entity5 and , for many , significant life - changing injuries as well as the traumatic memory of that day 's events			1

expert evidence establishes that vehicle was travelling at no more than 5.5mph at the time of impact			0
' in the face of overwhelming evidence , @entity11 pleaded guilty on 29 september to causing death by dangerous driving			1
' i hope the sentence handed down today will bring some comfort to @entity246 's family and friends , and to all those who were injured in this tragic incident			0
' a @entity51 spokeswoman said : ' @entity332 has some of the safest roads in the world and licensing rules play an important part in keeping our roads safe			0
' the rules are clear - all drivers must ensure that they are medically fit to drive and must notify @entity51 of the onset or worsening of a medical condition affecting this			1
