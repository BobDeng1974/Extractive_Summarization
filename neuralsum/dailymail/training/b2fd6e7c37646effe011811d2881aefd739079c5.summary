by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 07:32 est , 29 june 2012 @entity1 made a dig at the @entity3 as he announced plans to split @entity5 into two companies @entity1 criticised the @entity3 and vowed to take his money elsewhere as he announced the splitting up of his company			1
the billionaire media mogul said he was now ' a lot more reluctant ' to invest in the @entity12 ' because of the @entity3 '			1
mr @entity1 was discussing the separation of @entity5 into a film and tv entertainment company and one for publishing titles such as the @entity17 and the @entity18			1
the eighty - one year - old announced the plan after a year of intense pressure from the phone hacking scandal at the @entity23			1
but he denied the decision was a direct result of that and said there had been discussions about it for ' three years '			2
' there are billions and billions of dollars , and if @entity12 did n't want ' em , there are plenty of good places to put them here [ in the @entity35 ]			2
i 'm much more bullish about @entity35 than i am about @entity3 , ' he told @entity37			1
' i would be a lot more reluctant to invest in new things in @entity12 today , rather than here			0
' asked if this was because of the phone hacking revelations and the subsequent @entity43 , he said : ' no , not at all , just the @entity3			1
' but analysts were quick to point out that the @entity5 was now more likely to be given approval to take control of @entity47 if it mounts a renewed bid for the broadcaster			1
some saw the split as an attempt to distance the lucrative entertainment arm of the business from the newspaper division , which is under scrutiny over alleged phone hacking and payments to police			1
mr @entity1 said it was ' highly unlikely ' his son @entity61 would be in charge of the publishing business , responsible for titles including the @entity17 , the @entity18 , the @entity65 , the @entity66 and @entity67			0
split : the @entity5 board approved a plan to carve the conglomerate into distinct entertainment and publishing businesses he said that business prospects in the @entity35 were ' more rosy ' than the @entity12 but warned against @entity77 's healthcare plan creating a ' culture of entitlement '			1
' we 've seen where it 's taken @entity83			1
we 've seen where it 's taken @entity86 and @entity87 today			1
so , on a political level , i worry about it , ' he added			0
mr @entity1 said he will serve as chairman of both new companies and ceo of the entertainment company			0
the @entity1 family , which controls nearly 40 percent of the voting shares in @entity5 , is expected to maintain control of both companies			1
divided : the production company @entity101 ( left ) will be part of the new entertainment business , while @entity67 ( right ) will be on the publishing side @entity5 's board unanimously approved the split in principle			1
it will take a more formal look at the plan 's details in coming months			2
the separation is also subject to regulatory approval and is expected to take about a year			0
the split of @entity5 is a symbolic turning point for mr @entity1			1
through the years , he maintained a fondness for newspapers even as he bought entertainment companies and built a media conglomerate with a market value of $ 53 billion			2
he is known to have regularly called his newspaper editors and asked them : ' what 's doing ? ' there were some fears among commentators that the @entity17 and @entity18 could suffer without the financial support of a parent company			2
politicians and public officials were now less likely to be held to account without such established titles being able to investigate them , it is claimed			0
but investors have already applauded the change			0
since news of the split broke early tuesday , @entity5 shares are up 9 percent			1
they slipped 32 cents , or 1.4 percent , to $ 21.99 on thursday			0
@entity5 said existing shareholders will get one share of stock in the publishing company for every @entity5 share they own			1
the exact ratio could change			0
each company would maintain two classes of stock , voting shares and non-voting shares			0
mr @entity1 is hoping the television and movie company will be more highly valued by shareholders who had been unwilling to accept the dour growth prospects of the newspaper and book business			0
@entity156 ( left ) is seen as the likely future ceo of the entertainment business , while @entity159 ( right ) is a possible candidate to head the publishing business but he now faces the challenge of making the publishing division attractive to investors			0
taken as a whole , @entity5 's entertainment businesses are much more promising			1
in the nine months through march , the combined cable channel , tv station , satellite tv and movie businesses saw revenue rise 9 percent to $ 18.66 billion			2
operating profit rose 23 percent to $ 4.17 billion			0
by contrast , the publishing arm 's revenues and profits have been shrinking over the same period			2
revenues declined 4 percent to $ 6.22 billion while operating profits slipped 22 percent to $ 458 million			0
investors have long pestered @entity5 to get rid of the newspaper business			1
mr @entity1 acknowledged yesterday that the idea has been discussed internally for more than three years			0
still , he said he rejects ' naysayers ' who doubt the long - term future of the printed word			0
' the answer is one word : it 's digital , ' @entity1 said to analysts on a conference call			2
' people are buying pure papers printed on crushed wood , but they are equally getting their news in many other forms			0
' troubled : @entity1 's @entity5 has been under pressure to spin off its newspaper business following the phone - hacking scandal even so , @entity1 plans to put money behind those words			1
to address the concerns of future shareholders , he promised that the publishing division will be split off with ' a robust net cash position ' to be used for potential acquisitions			0
@entity5 had $ 10.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of march			1
analysts said the split will allow @entity1 to pursue the newspaper business with the same fervor he had when he began building his empire 60 years ago			0
it also contains the possible damage from mistakes , such as the one he made when he overpaid for @entity216 in 2007			0
' once the companies are separated , he 'll be able to make acquisitions without upsetting the valuation of the entertainment business , ' said @entity221 , an analyst with @entity222			2
' i do n't worry about the acquisitions he 's doing 2 to 3 years down the road in publishing			2

' it 's not the phone hacking , it 's the @entity3 , ' says mogul
tv stations and film to be separated from newspapers
could revive @entity5 bid to take control of @entity47
