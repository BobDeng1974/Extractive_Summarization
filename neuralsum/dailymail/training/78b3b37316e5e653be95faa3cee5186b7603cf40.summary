by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the greatest @entity5 in memory have often been defined by one - man teams , players of such influence and inspiration they have dragged their nation through the tournament			2
@entity10 and the @entity11 of 1986 is , of course , the most celebrated and emphatic of examples			2
but there have been countless others ; @entity28 firing @entity29 to the semi-finals of 1966 , @entity26 leading the @entity27 to the final eight years later , @entity15 doing likewise with @entity16 in 1994 and @entity17 twice the star of @entity20 ’s passage to the final in 1998 – when they won on home soil – and in 2006 when they were beaten by @entity16 , the latter perhaps more impressive			0
in @entity38 , however , there are a pair of contenders for his crown			2
for , like @entity10 , compatriot @entity40 and host nation golden boy @entity34 are shouldering the hopes of an entire population			1
and it appears they are more than capable of carrying such weighty expectation			0
it is shaping up to be the ultimate head - to - head			2
already the @entity64 comrades reside at the summit of the scoring chart with four goals apiece ; by this juncture in @entity46 28 years ago @entity10 had just one			2
their latest helpings were a pair of doubles ; @entity40 's in the 3 - 2 win over @entity73 , @entity34 in the 4 - 1 destruction of @entity75			1
to illustrate their influence , minus @entity40 ’s goals @entity11 would be back in @entity79 today having exited with just two points , while @entity38 – without the contribution of @entity34 – would have only just scraped through to the latter stages in second place			1
finisher : following his double against @entity75 , @entity34 has 37 goals in 53 internationals for @entity38 @entity88 is better than @entity89 attention : wherever @entity34 goes there are usually defenders in close attendance first up : @entity40 's strike sails past @entity95 in the @entity73 goal for opening goal @entity98 : @entity40 salute : @entity40 celebrates scoring his second goal of the game against @entity73 marked man : @entity40 has managed to shine despite the close attention of defenders stats : opta provide the numbers so far as it is , though , they both advance as group winners and so protect the possibility of a meeting in the @entity114 on july 13			1
it – @entity38 versus @entity11 , @entity34 versus @entity40 – is the final with which this most mesmerising of tournaments deserves to climax			1
we have all enjoyed the team ethic of the @entity120 , the organisation and killer instinct of the @entity27 , the flair of the @entity20 and the devastating dynamism of the @entity125			0
but there is something even more magical about one man overcoming the flaws and frailties of his team - mates to determine destiny			1
such impact gives birth to legend			0
such impact at a @entity37 cements it for eternity			0
and , like @entity10 , their genius is effortless , aesthetically at least			0
for if the likes of @entity141 and @entity142 are the water - carriers , then @entity40 and @entity34 turn it to wine			1
both players have laid quite fabulous foundations from which to build as we enter the knockout rounds , the environment in which tournaments and players are , ultimately , defined			0
failure to negotiate the next hurdle – @entity154 for @entity11 and @entity155 for @entity38 – would render their early impact sadly academic , for no - one remembers a group - stage hero ; @entity160 scored four times for @entity11 in the first round of @entity20 98 but did not even make @entity164 ’s all - star squad			1
the stage , then , is set			0
can either of the talismanic @entity166 prove they are @entity168 ? @entity10 - like legend awaits if so .			0

the @entity64 team - mates lead the *goalscoring* charts with four strikes each
@entity40 scored twice in @entity11 's 3 - 2 win over @entity73 to *confirm* them as winners of @entity178
@entity34 also *bagged* a brace as @entity38 topped @entity181 with a 4 - 1 *victory* over @entity46
@entity38 now face @entity155 in the last 16 on *saturday* while @entity11 take on @entity154 on *tuesday*
