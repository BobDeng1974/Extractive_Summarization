by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 1 october 2013 the @entity1 and @entity2 are set to copy millions of other @entity4 families by building a conservatory on their new 10 - bedroom country bolthole in the grounds of @entity10			1
@entity11 , @entity2 and @entity12 are likely to move into @entity13 in a matter of months and are spending large sums to make the @entity17 mansion more private , secure and comfortable			1
royal aides have now applied for planning consent to put a glass - roofed extension on the kitchen at the @entity23 property , which has been given to the couple by the @entity25			1
new life : a conservatory is to be built on @entity13 , the @entity1 and @entity2 of @entity1 's future home in the grounds of @entity10 second home : if as expected the @entity31 move in , the new conservatory could be built in the place of the current one , which overlooks the grand gardens their proposed conservatory is an adaptation of a planned 16ft by 16ft garden room which has already been approved by @entity40			1
but the application is not being published ' for reasons of national security '			2
the original plans for the garden room showed it having panoramic views from its windows on all three sides with a tiled roof			1
but a new planning application for the @entity23 mansion on the @entity10 estate asks for a glazed roof on the extension instead of tiles , allowing even more sunlight to flood in			2
an architect 's drawing submitted with the application , shows a 10ft by 6ft table as the room 's centre piece where @entity11 and @entity2 and baby @entity12 will eat and entertain guests			1
the @entity25 has asked the current tenant to vacate the property as soon as possible , four years before his lease is up , and he may be gone by the end of the year			2
the conservatory will overlook a patio with a new pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for plants to trail through and provide shade			0
grand : the 10 - bedroom @entity23 mansion already has a tenant , but the @entity25 has asked him to leave four years before his lease is up the grade two listed hall already has a conservatory , but it is unclear if it will be kept or knocked down to make way for the new one			2
the new plans have been drawn up by architect @entity91 , who was behind a controversial extension for @entity93 at his own country home @entity95			0
the amended application , submitted by the @entity10 estate , includes plans to install a generator to ensure that security equipment still functions in the event of a power cut			0
it also asks the council to do away with an earlier requirement for an archaeological dig to take place on the route of a proposed new driveway to the ten bedroom house			0
the dig was originally proposed as the field which the driveway will cross was once the site of the village of @entity13 which dates back to @entity116 times			1
last week it was revealed that the path of the new driveway had been carved out by diggers and archaeologists had begun a preliminary investigation to see what was under the surface			0
new home : @entity126 , @entity2 , and prince @entity11 , @entity1 , pictured with their son @entity12 , are expected to move into @entity13 in the next few months plans : a church situated near @entity13 on the @entity10 is having to change its entrance to allow the couple their own private entrance royal aides state in the application that the foundations of the road will not be deep enough to disturb any ancient remains			1
the @entity1 and @entity2 of @entity1 's plans for a conservatory on their new home is based on a trend started more than two centuries ago			2
@entity4 's love of them dates back to the early 19th century , when they were a signature of the grandest properties			2
the glass structures allowed people to enjoy their gardens all year round , and they were often doubled as greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables			0
they became more mainstream thanks to the @entity154 , which housed the @entity155 in @entity156 , and a glass extension soon became a must for the rich and famous			0
there was a further boom in the 1920s but it was not until the 1970s that they became affordable for many and became the emblem of the upwardly mobile , now often called @entity167 and @entity168			0
today homeowners can construct their own ones using @entity172 kits costing just £ 995 , but the most expensive can cost more than £ 60,000			0
they propose that archaeologists will monitor building work and that a full dig will only be carried out if any important relics are unearthed			0
council officials are due to decide in days whether the amendment will be allowed , possibly using delegated powers so the plans do not have to go before councillors			0
the change will speed up work on the new driveway , although alterations to the hall are unlikely to be completed for some months			2
the start of work has raised speculation that @entity11 , 31 , and wife @entity2 are set to move in within a matter of months			1
work has also started on creating a new car park and path for @entity195 's church next door to the hall as the existing church gate will become a private entrance for the @entity1 and @entity2			2
@entity13 is set to become the couple 's second luxury home following the prince 's decision to leave the @entity203 last month after three years as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in @entity205			1
he and @entity2 are in the process of moving into their new @entity156 home - the 21 - room @entity210 at @entity212 - which has been renovated at a cost to taxpayers of £ 1.1million			1
but all the work to @entity13 will be paid for by the royal family as it is privately owned by the @entity25			1
the hall which includes a tennis court and swimming pool is around two miles from @entity10			0
it is surrounded by farmland on the @entity25 's 20,000 acre estate , meaning that @entity2 and @entity11 will have a high level of privacy to bring up baby @entity12			1
the queen is believed to have asked the current tenant to leave even though he has four years left on his lease			0
businessman @entity229 has rented the hall from the @entity25 for the last 13 years and has been running his bespoke timber company , @entity232 , from its stables			0
his company 's blog confirmed in july that the hall would soon be ' faced with royalty once more '			2
@entity232 has already moved its workshops and offices to new premises at the former @entity241 base in @entity17			1
mr @entity229 and his family are understood to be moving soon , but he has not responding to requests for comment			0
@entity245 gave planning permission in march for improvements to @entity13 including the garden room			1
home sweet home : @entity212 , where the royal couple have given their apartment a £ 1million makeover , pictured shrouded in scaffolding and coverings consent was also given for a garage block and wood store to be converted into storage areas and accommodation which could be used by police guards or baby @entity12 's nanny the re-routing of the driveway will mean that the front gate to the house will be moved so members of the public will be kept away			1
it is understood that dozens of extra armed officers are being recruited to help provide security at @entity13			1
@entity273 confirmed in july that the force was looking for extra firearms officer to ' address a current shortfall in numbers '			0
the hall was used as an illicit bolt - hole by @entity93 and the then @entity280 during their long - running affair when it was rented by the prince 's late friend @entity283			2
prince @entity11 , who is close to the @entity286 ' four sons is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to the hall as a child			0
a @entity290 spokeswoman refused to discuss the plans for @entity13 , saying : ' it is a private matter			1
we wo n't be making any comment on it at all			0
