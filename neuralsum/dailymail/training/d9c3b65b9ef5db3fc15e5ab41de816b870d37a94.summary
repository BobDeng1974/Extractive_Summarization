sandy the @entity8 , dubbed ' wonky ' , was discovered unable to walk after being dumped by his owners on the @entity12 island of @entity13 two months ago			1
he had been left abandoned in a malnourished state - causing him to develop severely deformed legs			1
he has now taken his first steps after @entity21 ( right ) drove him to @entity22 for surgery recovering : following his arrival in @entity26 , vets offered to operate on @entity19 ( pictured with ms @entity27 ) for free but he was given a chance of a new life after @entity21 raised funds to drive him more than 2,000 miles to @entity31 in @entity22 , where vets offered to operate on him free of charge			1
now , following two successful operations , @entity19 can stand up , walk and run for the first time			0
ms @entity27 , 55 , who will adopt the dog once he has fully recovered , said he was still undergoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy at @entity38 at the @entity39			2
' we are one million percent happy with how the surgery has gone , ' she said			0
' the vets have done an amazing job			0
' wonky ' : @entity19 had been dumped by owners in a malnourished state - causing him to develop deformed legs saved : the dog , pictured before his operations , is still undergoing courses in physiotherapy and hydrotherapy deformed : the extent of @entity19 's deformity - believed to have been caused by malnutrition - is shown on x-ray ' when we first brought him over from @entity12 , he stayed with us over @entity56 and as a result he learnt his way around			1
he became a part of the family and parting with him now would be completely out of the question			0
' @entity63 , who carried out Â £ 2,000 worth of operations on @entity19 's legs for free , said he was optimistic that the dog 's recovery would be successful			1
' the second operation was more complicated due to fact that both front legs were deformed but slightly in different way , which made the repair of the left leg trickier , and a tendon was compromised as a result , ' he said			0
happy : ms @entity27 ( right ) , 55 , said she was ' one million percent happy ' with how the surgery had gone			2
meanwhile , vet @entity63 ( left ) said he was optimistic that the dog 's recovery would be successful unknown : vets at companion care vets are still none - the - wiser as to how @entity19 's bowed legs came about loved : ms @entity27 said @entity19 quickly became a part of her family - and that she could not part with him now ' the rehabilitation is taking longer due to complication with infection ( which is now good under control ) and the damage to the tendon			1
' despite having successfully completed both operations , vets are still none - the - wiser as to how the bowed legs came about			2
' we believe @entity19 's condition developed due to nutritional deficiencies , but we do not have a proof one way or another , ' said mr @entity63			0
complications : mr @entity63 said the dog 's rehabilitation was taking a while ' due to complication with infection ' difference : @entity19 's right front leg , which is now straight following the two operations @entity108 contrast : the dog 's front legs appear almost perfectly straight on x-ray ' it is impossible to say why his legs came short when he was a puppy			0
' since @entity19 arrived in the country , numerous donations have been made to ms @entity120 's @entity119 - based charity , @entity121 in @entity122			1
these have enabled the charity to fund metal plates to straighten @entity19 's legs , which normally cost Â £ 200 , as well as a dog bed			2
heading home : since @entity19 arrived in the country , numerous donations have been made to ms @entity120 's @entity119 - based charity , @entity121 in @entity122			1
above , the dog is pictured recovering with vets ' @entity19 has n't had any more material donations since the bed and plates were given to us , ' said ms @entity27			1
' however , we have had cash donations from all around the world , as far afield as @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			0
' these have been invaluable as we might have to pay for an @entity142 for @entity19 as he might be blind			0
' following his recovery , @entity19 will join the charity 's 12 other dogs at its rescue centre in @entity147 , @entity119			2
