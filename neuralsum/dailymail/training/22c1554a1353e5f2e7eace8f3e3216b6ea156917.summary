former deputy head @entity55 – dismissed after criticising behaviour in state schools at last year ’s @entity82 conference – said violence was prominent because the school system was ' broken '			1
she said : ' @entity85 and shoving and worse forms of violence are a huge problem			0
the problem is the endemic culture of blame in schools – bad behaviour is also attributed to bad teaching			1
' management push this theory , children use it as an excuse , and teachers themselves begin to believe it			0
' you have a situation where struggling teachers will not seek help for fear of looking incompetent			0
and meanwhile children are left to think that they can get away with anything and push the boundaries			0
' a recent series of attacks – ranging from stabbing to rape – support the report ’s findings that violent behaviour is prominent in the classroom			1
experts have blamed soft parenting and teaching for creating a generation unable to respect authority or interact socially without lashing out			0
they fear parents struggling to juggle the pressures of modern life are unable to spend quality time with their children			0
instead many are left unsupervised in front of a tv or computer			0
@entity129 of the @entity130 said : ' adults fail to teach discipline and a respect for authority			0
' at a tender age children are told they are the centre of the universe and it makes them too self - centred and totally uncontrollable			0
' there were almost 1,000 exclusions every day in @entity143 ’s schools last year			1
in addition , one in four children have been bullied at school and one in five have been a victim of bullying outside school			0
@entity149 , the @entity151 ’s ' behaviour tsar ' , said : ' behaviour is good at most schools , but these figures demonstrate concerning levels of violence in a small number			1
' this kind of behaviour is a serious disruption to teaching and learning			2
it is a major factor in deterring good people from becoming teachers and is a common reason for experienced teachers to leave the profession			0
' the @entity78 today publishes guidance for teachers on how to deal with bad behaviour			1
ministers want to ' unequivocally restore adult authority to the classroom '			0
they have axed @entity176 ’s 600 page guidance – which they claim confused teachers – and have replaced it with just 52 pages			2

at present , teachers are not allowed to touch a child in the course of teaching them a musical instrument or helping them in an accident			0
teachers will also be able to use reasonable force to eject unruly pupils			2
and heads will be able to search without consent for an extended list of banned items such as alcohol , illegal drugs and stolen property			0
ministers will also place an onus on schools to crack down on bullying			0
in addition , pupils who make false allegations will face suspension , expulsion , or criminal prosecution			1
schools minister @entity210 said : ' this new , clear and concise guidance removes the red tape that has stopped teachers from being confident in maintaining discipline in the classroom			0

education secretary @entity222 has approached the headmaster of @entity224 , in @entity225 , to persuade him to accept the vacant £ 180,000 post at @entity227			0
sir @entity216 takes an uncompromising view towards substandard behaviour			2
he imposes strict penalties on pupils who do not do their homework and has a zero tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour .			1

1,000 pupils are excluded every day
one in four staff faces false allegations
a previous version of this *article* reported that 1,000 pupils a day are excluded for violent behaviour and that this has *doubled* in a year . while the figure for exclusions is correct – and all the statistics were put to the @entity78 before publication – this does not in fact represent an increase .
