by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 @entity2 won his first @entity5 title on sunday after an extraordinary finish to the @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity2 almost holed his approach to the 18th hole to card a closing 65 and force a play - off with @entity13 's @entity12 after the pair finished tied on 18 under par at @entity16			1
they returned to the 18th for the first extra hole and the tournament looked to be over when @entity21 's drive missed the fairway and finished up against a wall , close to a plaque commemorating the place from where the late @entity26 pulled off a miraculous escape on his way to victory in 1993			1
winner : @entity2 poses with the trophy after the final round of the @entity7 storm did not appear optimistic of repeating the feat , the 36 - year - old saying to his caddie : ' oh well , never mind , it was n't meant to be , ' before pitching out sideways			1
@entity2 had just 86 yards to the hole from a fairway bunker but did not even attempt to go for the green , a decision described as ' heartless ' by former @entity5 player @entity42 , commentating for @entity43			1
however , @entity2 had the last laugh as he pitched out left of the water guarding the front of the green and then chipped to two feet and holed for a winning par after @entity21 missed from long range			1
@entity52 scratcher : @entity12 was trying to escape from an awful spot during the play - off at @entity16 - sur - @entity16 @entity26 's spot : storm 's escape route brought back memories of the late , great @entity59 the 26 - year - old , who usually plays on the @entity61 and won in @entity62 in 2012 , said : ' it feels spectacular			1
i 've put in a lot of hard work and have been playing well the last couple of weeks and to put it all together this week is very special to me			0
' asked by @entity42 why he chose to lay - up on the play - off hole , @entity2 added on @entity43 4 : ' i was just debating in my head the worst - case possibilities and scenarios			1
' it was a tough shot out of the bunker and with @entity12 only going to make par at best , i decided not to risk going in the water			1
in the end it was the right play			0
' storm , whose only previous @entity5 win came in the @entity80 in 2007 , held a one - shot overnight lead and made the ideal start with birdies at the first two holes , but then three - putted from the front edge of the fourth green for a bogey			2
that allowed @entity2 to draw level thanks to a tap - in eagle on the reachable par - four seventh and from then on the tournament was wide open with four players briefly tied for the lead on the back nine			2
storm and playing partner @entity94 edged ahead with birdies on the 15th , but @entity94 bogeyed the 17th after his approach plugged in a greenside bunker			0
that looked set to give storm a crucial advantage playing the last , but @entity2 in the group ahead saw his approach almost spin into the hole to set up a birdie which eventually forced extra holes			2
second place lifted storm from 159th on the race to @entity111 to 64th and completed a memorable weekend after he won a Â£ 100,000 sports car for a hole - in - one on the 11th in the third round			2
bailed out : @entity2 found a bunker with his tee shot while @entity21 struggled , but chose to play safe @entity117 route : the @entity3 chose a strange method to score the par he needed to wrap up victory last laugh : @entity2 emerged victorious at the beautiful venue in @entity8 ' it 's tough to take right now , ' @entity12 said			1
' i did n't have much time between finishing my final round and starting the play - off , so i probably was n't as composed as i should have been			2
' but overall it 's been an unbelievable week			0
obviously i would 've loved to have won here this week , and it may take a little while to get over the disappointment , but on the plus side i 've secured my card for next season and that has been the goal the last few weeks			0
' i was a bit disappointed to have left my birdie putt on the last in regulation so short , but i did n't know @entity2 had birdied the last to get to 18 under or else i might have gone for the flag and given myself a better chance of making birdie			0
' @entity94 finished joint third alongside @entity13 's @entity146 , with @entity147 and @entity148 another shot back in fifth , @entity147 's 63 the best round of the day			0
@entity152 's @entity151 finished joint ninth on 13 under after a 65 which included a hole - in - one on the 11th			0
' i saw the crowd were celebrating but i did n't know if that was because it was close , or in the hole			0
then i realised , but i did n't know if there was a prize , ' @entity151 said			0
' @entity163 told me i 'd won the car , but i thought it was only for the first hole - in - one , and unfortunately i was right			0

@entity2 won the @entity7 at @entity168 - @entity16
@entity3 beat @entity13 @entity12 in play - off
storm hit wild drive that finished near plaque dedicated to @entity26
but @entity2 still played short of water from bunker 86 yards from the pin
@entity2 got up - and - down for par to win as storm bogeyed the hole
