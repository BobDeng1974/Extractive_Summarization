pet owners have been urged to look out for the disease - which so far has no name - if their dogs start to forming lesions on their lower legs			1

so far 16 dogs have died in the last year - nine in @entity14 , and seven in other parts of the country including @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
tests : vets are fighting to find what disease is crippling and killing dogs across the @entity3 ( stock image ) dogs which have been killed by the disease develop lesions on the lower legs followed by kidney failure between two and seven days later			1
vet @entity33 said that the deaths have similarities to a disease called @entity38 rot which was first reported in the @entity39 in the 1980s			1
he said @entity38 rot was caused by toxins from the e. coli bacteria - but this had not yet been traced in the @entity3			1
mr @entity33 , from @entity43 in @entity44 , near @entity45 , told the @entity46 : ' the advice i would give to the pet - owning general public is if you see a wound on your dog 's leg , where you might ordinarily leave that for 12 to 24 hours , the advice would be to take your dog to the vets			2
' most vets are now aware of the condition so seek early veterinary attention			2
' @entity62 president @entity61 said : ' dog owners in these regions will feel understandably anxious about the recent cases but it seems that only a very small proportion of the dogs walked in these areas each day have been affected			0
' owners should make sure they are aware of the signs and symptoms and contact their vet immediately if they have any concerns			0
' a @entity76 spokesman said that the cause of the deaths had not yet been confirmed and added that signs had been put up to advise dog owners to look out for the symptoms			0
he said : ' there have been a few as yet unexplained incidents in the @entity13 and the @entity76 is working closely with vets and putting up notices to inform the public			0
' owners should always keep their dogs under close control and be aware of anything they may pick up , chew or eat in a woodland area			0
if their dog becomes ill they should contact a vet as soon as possible with as much information as they can			0
' the sign says : ' dog owners are advised to look out for wounds or lesions on the limbs or face of their dog which will not heal			2
affected dogs then go on to develop signs of severe depression , loss of appetite and vomiting , quickly accompanied by acute injury to the kidneys			0
