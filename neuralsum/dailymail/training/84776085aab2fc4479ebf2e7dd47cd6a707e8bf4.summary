by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has delivered a stark warning to @entity6 ’s young hopefuls , saying they will have no international future unless they show total commitment to his project			1
the under 21 head coach names his squad for the forthcoming @entity15 2015 qualifiers against @entity16 and @entity17 on thursday but it is unlikely to contain @entity20 ’s @entity19 or @entity22 ’s @entity21			1
both defenders are expected to be selected for senior duty			1
there will also be no place for @entity27 or @entity28			2
they were key players in @entity3 ’s early games in charge but have slipped out of contention , while others like @entity35 ’s @entity34 and @entity36 of @entity37 have never been selected			1
warning : @entity3 has told young @entity6 hopefuls they must show commitment to his project senior duty : young defender @entity21 and @entity19 are expected to be selected by @entity6 @entity43 winger @entity42 , who last week was caught speeding in his £ 188,000 @entity44 in @entity45 , withdrew from the last squad @entity3 selected to face @entity47 in may due to a minor injury , while @entity49 midfielder @entity28 has had his own fitness problems			1
but until the pair prove they are up to speed physically and ready to dedicate themselves , @entity3 will stick with the group that has taken @entity6 to the brink of next summer ’s tournament in the @entity57			1
‘ the door will always be open for lads to work their way back in , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ but we want to be world champions and to get there it is going to take a certain mindset			2
we have a group of players who have that mindset			2
penalty : @entity43 winger @entity27 was caught speeding in his £ 188,000 @entity70 ‘ if players do n’t match that mentality and people pull out of squads , others will come in			2
it will be hard to get back in			0
‘ we had some boys who over the course of last year did not necessarily buy into what we wanted to do			0
i am only prepared to work with players who are committed to being the best they can be			0
there has to be a commitment to the international programme and a recognition of the values			2
we are not running a community programme			0
this is an elite sporting environment			0
‘ not everybody has wanted to be where @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 have been			0
that is why they have got 100 caps and won the @entity97 ; they have been prepared to commit to being the very best			0
they are world class for a reason			0
’ @entity90 believes @entity100 has the potential to win 100 caps and @entity3 feels the @entity103 winger has an outstanding chance of reaching that target because of his mentality			1
@entity100 is still eligible for under 21 duty but @entity3 feels he has graduated to the seniors			1
‘ he is a boy who posts a picture of himself in the gym straight after coming back from the @entity111 so that tells you what he is like and something about his mentality , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ the way he has started with @entity103 tells you that he does n’t think , “ oh that was good , i ’ve made it ”			0
‘ it looks like he has had a taste of it and he likes it and he wants to go again			0
he is a tough kid and he wants to be the best he can			0
