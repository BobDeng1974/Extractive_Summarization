by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 10 july 2013 a 78 - year - old woman died after her emergency pendant went unanswered for five hours			1
her frantic midnight calls from the panic button round her neck were missed by @entity6 ( @entity7 ) because only one worker was on duty , and he had been logged out of the system			1
it was not until five hours later , just before 6am on april 6 last year , that the council employee logged back in again			0
by this time mrs @entity13 was dead			2
a former telecoms engineer who used to install the systems for @entity16 claims he warned bosses such an incident could happen back in 2007			2
@entity19 , who worked for @entity16 at time of @entity13 's death , with a log of her failed calls			1
mr @entity19 , who was not the agency worker involved , was critical of the system her calls from @entity27 sheltered housing complex , in @entity29 , went through to the lone operator at @entity31 but he missed it , causing the computer system to log him out of ' call receiving mode ' after three minutes			1
a post-mortem concluded mrs @entity13 died of natural causes but it was not attributed to the lack of response to her alarm and there was no inquest			1
telecoms engineer @entity19 , 54 , said a single person should never have been left in charge of the system			0
he added @entity47 staff who used to be on the same corridor as the @entity7 operators and would cover for them when needed were moved elsewhere in 2010			0
he said : ' why gamble on having one operator ? to me it 's just reckless having one person working on a particular night			0
' the weakest link should always be the customer not wearing their pendant , not the council having just one member of staff on because they ca n't afford more			0
@entity27 , @entity62 in @entity29 , @entity63 , where @entity13 lived ' i was paranoid about the safety of the clients and i tried my best to update the system and bring it into the @entity67			2
' mr @entity19 , of @entity68 , says the operator was promising but was inexperienced and had not been trained to deal with the situation he was confronted with			0
the operator was immediately sacked , though a police investigation found insufficient evidence to charge him with any crime			0
mr @entity19 was himself fired in july last year over an unrelated case of ' gross misconduct ' , though he feels he was forced out by the council over the incident with mrs @entity13			0
@entity16 in south - east @entity79 , which operates the 24 - hour response system , has apologised ' unreservedly ' to the family of @entity13			1
however , it claims mr @entity19 did not alert the council about problems prior to mrs @entity13 's death			2
@entity27 , where @entity13 lived when she died of natural causes , after her panic calls went unanswered the council said : ' following a post-mortem examination , it was concluded mrs @entity13 died of natural causes			1
' the lack of response by @entity7 was not an attributable factor in mrs @entity13 's death , and the case did not progress to an inquest			2
' the @entity7 staff and managers were very upset this incident happened and the council has apologised unreservedly to mrs @entity13 's sister for the distress it caused			2
' ' mr @entity19 was not party to this incident and is speculating on a situation while not being in possession of the full facts			0
' he did not alert managers , prior to the incident , that there could be a future issue			0
' the operator on duty that night , an agency worker , has not been employed by the council since			1
' the agency worker had been given full training on the @entity113 and had even been given extra , specific training on what to do should the system ever lock out			1
' due to the low workload , the system was previously monitored overnight by one operator			1
' now , if there is ever a time when there can not be two members of staff available , the calls for the entire shift are all set to go to a central monitoring service instead			0

@entity13 , 78 , called from panic button round her neck but got no response
her calls were missed by an agency worker at @entity6
low workload meant system was monitored overnight by one operator
she died from natural causes
@entity16 has apologised to dead woman 's family
