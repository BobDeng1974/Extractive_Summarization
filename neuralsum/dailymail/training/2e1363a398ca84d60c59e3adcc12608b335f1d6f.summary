by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 11:06 est , 21 november 2012 an elderly couple have been billed £ 500 by their tv company - for hundreds of pornographic films they say they never ordered			2
great - grandparents @entity6 , 74 , and wife @entity7 , 71 , were stunned when @entity8 demanded the money , saying 150 pay - per - view adult films had been streamed to their cable tv account			1
it is the second time the couple , from @entity14 , near @entity15 , have been caught in a row over porn films with @entity8			1
up to 14 films a day : great - grandparents @entity6 and @entity20 were billed for porn they say they did not watch in 2009 they were also accused of ordering £ 190 of adult @entity22 eventually tore up the bill and turned off the couple ’s service			1
but earlier this year the couple decided to resubscribe to the catch - up and on - demand services			0
within days , dozens of adult films had been ordered , seemingly from the couple ’s address , including 14 in one day			1
stream of pornography : a page of the @entity38 ' bill showing just how many adult films they are supposed to have ordered and there 's more : countless adult movies charged at £ 5.99 a time meant a hefty bill @entity8 has again waived the charge - but the couple says they have been told they will be liable for any future bills if they want the tv services reconnecting			1
mrs @entity20 , a retired nursery nurse , said : ' it feels to us just like groundhog day			0
' we had this problem before and we thought when we re-applied to be connected that @entity8 would have solved the problem of what went wrong previously			0
' the family all think it is really funny - @entity6 gets ribbed at the post office where he gets asked if he ’s seen any good films lately			2
' @entity8 : the tv provider has waived the charges for the @entity60 for the second time @entity8 boss sir @entity62 : the @entity60 hope he will be able to resolve their problem a @entity8 spokesman said the films must have been accessed from the couple 's account because a secret pin number was needed to watch the films			1
' adult content can only be viewed after an individual pin number is given by the household , ensuring people can safely watch the content they choose			0
' we ’ve made sure mr and mrs @entity20 ’s service is pin - protected and their tv set - top box will no longer be able to view age - restricted content			2
' mrs @entity20 added : ' i would like to make a direct appeal to sir @entity62 , to say to him he needs to sort it out			0
' we are loyal customers , we were told by a manager at @entity8 that we can have the catch - up , which is what we want , but we have to take on demand as well , which we do n’t want			2
' we were also told if we have the service again we will be expected to sign an agreement to say we are liable for any more film orders			0
we feel like we are being penalised			0

great - grandparents @entity6 and @entity20 , from @entity15 , were charged for ' watching ' 150 adult films
