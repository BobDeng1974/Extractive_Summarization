if the people in charge of @entity3 were searching for a serene , unruffled , semi-detached figure to be their new manager , then they may have landed the ideal candidate in @entity7			1
where others might have bawled colourful curses at the inadequacies of this abject @entity3 side , @entity8 remained resolutely undramatic			1
it was , he said , a ‘ very disappointing ’ start to the season			1
elsewhere at @entity17 , more damaging verdicts were being delivered , but we sensed that the new man had shrewd reasons for appearing so reasonable			2
his inherited team ’s performance had spoken for itself			2
now the whole world knew that reports of @entity3 ’s demise had not been exaggerated			1
and so , he could start work with a clean sheet			2
anything he achieves will be down to his own efforts			2
after almost a quarter of a century in football management , @entity8 understands how the politics work			1
throughout the afternoon , he had resisted any temptation to occupy centre stage , almost as if he was disclaiming responsibility for this shambles of a side			1
he entered the arena with the very minimum of fuss			2
wearing a dark suit and a sombre stare and carrying a clipboard , he resembled a senior accountant on his way to an early lunch			2
the crowd ’s welcome was warm and he acknowledged it with a brief , polite smile			2
for the next 45 minutes he did not leave his seat , gazing impassively at the dire , unfolding spectacle			2
@entity75 was when a @entity3 team sheet read like a threatening letter			1
meet the new boss : @entity8 waves at the @entity17 crowd as he walks out for his first competitive game poor start : @entity3 's captain @entity83 reacts after @entity42 scores @entity29 's winner glimmer of hope : @entity83 hooked in an equaliser for @entity3 early in the second half but they fell to defeat sure they had suffered injuries and untimely absences , but this one looked like the kind of side they used to put out against non-league teams in the early rounds of the @entity97 , when the season was wearing and the stars were weary			1
later , he would attempt to soften the impression his players had made			0
‘ in the first half , i saw a lot of very nervous players , people making the wrong choices , ’ he said			0
‘ but that ’s @entity3			1
you have to cope with that pressure			0
’ indeed you do , but that happy day is some way off and he seemed to know it all too well			0
so he sat and stared across at the sir @entity112 , bearing banners which echoed past glories : ‘ @entity115 ’ , ‘ sir @entity116 ’ , and silhouettes of all the trophies which the old chap won			2
popular : fans scramble for an autograph from @entity8 as he makes his way to the home dug - out not impressed : @entity8 looks annoyed as @entity39 makes a point during the match downcast : @entity8 knows there are serious shortcomings with his squad and investment is needed he would not have been daunted by such slogans ; sir @entity112 himself might not have won a speck of silver with a back three of @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
a goal down at half time — ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’ , the @entity29 singers informed @entity8 — he walked sedately back to the dressing room , apparently in no great hurry to assault his troops			1
in fact , he had decided to jettison his back three in favour of a more conventional four ; a conclusion he had reached after some 25 minutes			0
half time would be taken up in explaining his expectations			0
there were one or two consolations , of course			0
@entity157 , the expensive recruit from @entity158 , looked smart , quick and thoughtful , while his new captain @entity83 gave his all , since he knows no other way			1
impressive : new signing @entity157 looked good in the centre of midfield for @entity3 work rate : @entity83 gave everything in the captaincy role but could n't avert the defeat fitting in : @entity139 was pressed into action in the @entity3 defence after an injury crisis the @entity83 decision offered further proof of @entity8 ’s political skills , since it was not so much a masterstroke , more an appointment he would have found it difficult to withhold			1
@entity83 ’s goal , early in the second half , did not rouse his manager to anything resembling emotion			1
instead , @entity8 frowned gently and scribbled a note on that clipboard			1
clearly , the fist - clenching , eye - bulging , ‘ show ‘ em you ’re passionate ’ pantomime is not to his taste — for which much thanks			2
but there were times when his self - control must have been tested , especially in the 75th minute , when @entity3 conceded a goal which owed much to @entity29 swift thinking but also reeked of dim - witted defending			1
the full implications were now sinking in			0
he already knew that the place need urgent redecoration , now he realised that the foundations themselves were rotten			0
he has been required to fight a good many fires in a garlanded career , but this is a rare conflagration			0
@entity204 : @entity8 watches on from his seat in the dug - out greetings : @entity8 meets @entity207 ahead of kick - off at @entity17 on the whistle , he took time to leave his seat			1
he actually signed a good many autographs , then he slapped a few palms as he wandered along the front row of the stands , before shuffling away , still carrying his clipboard			0
he tried to put it into perspective			0
‘ it is not good , because we had built up a lot of confidence and it will be smashed down because of the result ’ , he said			0
he praised his team ’s ‘ fantastic attitude ’ , the way they had ‘ tried their utmost ’			0
then he reflected , more realistically : ‘ but running is not enough			0
you must also use your brain ’			0
it was the closest he came to public criticism , and we sensed that he would have felt foolish had he not hinted at his true feelings			0
‘ i shall tell the players what i think of them ’ , he muttered and it sounded more like a promise than a mild threat			0
for there will be changes , many changes at what they still refer to as ‘ @entity246 ’			0
and @entity3 have taken the massive gamble that the serene , unruffled fellow with the clipboard is the man to make them .			1

@entity7 suffered a 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity29 in his first @entity31 match
the new @entity3 manager sat calmly in the dug - out throughout
@entity8 remained undramatic afterwards , calling it ' very disappointing '
investment in @entity3 's squad is urgently needed if they are to *challenge*
@entity83 captained the side and scored to make it 1 - 1
but goals from @entity265 and @entity42 gave @entity29 *victory*
