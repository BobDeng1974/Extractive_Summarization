research has revealed that diesel fumes could cause children to develop autism and schizophrenia an environmental report has blasted diesel cars - despite earlier government efforts to encourage drivers to switch from petrol to diesel			1
separate research has also revealed that diesel fumes could cause children to develop autism and schizophrenia			1
nitrogen dioxide , a chemical present in diesel emissions , causes eye , nose and throat irritation and is said to cause breathing problems in young children			1
but scientists have warned that as well as damaging the lungs , the fumes could cause autism and schizophrenia to develop within children living near busy roads			1
long - term exposure to the fumes changes the way that a child 's brain develops , it has been revealed			0
the danger of the fumes has been compared to the effect of lead in petrol			2
in 1999 , lead in petrol was banned after scientists revealed that lead additives caused brain damage in children			2
the concerns over the fumes have been raised in a report by the @entity47			0
dr @entity48 , a researcher in respiratory toxicology at @entity51 , and a co-author of the report told @entity54 that there is ' strong evidence ' that diesel pollutants have an effect on cognitive function in children			0
dr @entity48 said the organisation planned to carry out more research on the theme in @entity65 because the original study was conducted in @entity67 where diesel vehicle use is significantly lower			1
the study , from @entity67 , reported last year in the @entity70 , looked at 525 children , 279 of the children had autism			2
@entity65 was covered in a cloud of smog last week after dust from the @entity77 became became mixed with pollution from @entity79 and the @entity80 a warning from the @entity82 in report by commissioned by the @entity80 @entity84 and @entity85 ( @entity86 ) has raised concerns that nitrogen dioxide emissions , created by diesel cars , have continued to rise over the past decade results found that the pollution levels experienced by mothers ' during pregnancy and by the babies the first year of their life were strongly linked to the risk of developing autism			1
a further two @entity99 studies found that older men and women exposed to high levels of pollution experienced higher memory loss compared to others of the same age			0
much of the research on the topic has come from the @entity99 - despite the fact that diesel is mainly used in buses and heavy goods vehicles there rather than normal cars			1
research in @entity67 found that the pollution levels experienced by mothers ' during pregnancy and by the babies the first year of their life were strongly linked to the risk of developing autism on wednesday in @entity65 , there was a surge in 999 calls after a cloud of smog caused breathing problems across the city			1
now a warning from the @entity82 in report by commissioned by the @entity80 @entity84 and @entity85 ( @entity86 ) has raised concerns that nitrogen dioxide emissions , created by diesel cars , have continued to rise over the past decade			1
in the study , scientists have urged ministers to make a u-turn back to petrol vehicles			0
the air quality group , which provides independent scientific advice to the government , told ministers that it would be easier to promote petrol rather than attempt to clean up diesel			0
one of the authors of the report , @entity147 , blasted the @entity148 for the ' complete failure ' of the way emissions are regulated			0
mr @entity147 told @entity54 that @entity79 guidelines on testing cars were ' too lenient '			0
tests did not reflect how vehicles perform on real roads , where they produce four to five times the number of emissions , he said			0
mr @entity147 said : ' switching to petrol is the best idea for light vehicles ' , which includes cars , taxis and small vans			0
a switch from diesel to petrol would be a lengthy process because a third of @entity80 's 29million private cars are diesel - powered			1
a switch from diesel to petrol would be a lengthy process because a third of @entity80 's 29million private cars are diesel powered			1
and the number of diesel cars is on the up - half of the new cars registered in 2012 were diesel powered and the number of diesel cars is on the up - half of the new cars registered in 2012 used diesel			2
this is the third time that scientists have recommended a move from diesel to petrol			2
the two previous warnings were both archived by @entity86			0
a government spokesman said that there was no ' single magic bullet ' to tackle air pollution and one form of transport could not be linked to pollution levels .			0

nitrogen dioxide , created by diesel causes damage to lungs and throat
@entity99 scientists have warned that fumes also linked to autism
warning comes after research carried out on autistic babies in @entity67
@entity80 report now recommends switch from petrol to diesel cars
