by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:46 pm on 21st november 2011 a boy with a rare cardiac condition has been banned from laughing in case his chuckles trigger a fatal heart attack			1
@entity7 has a dangerously high heart rate and is on doctors ' orders to keep calm to ensure his ticker does n't beat any faster			1
the brave seven - year - old has stopped exercising and his mother has been told to make sure he does n't laugh too hard in case his heart develops a severely abnormal heart rhythm , which can cause sudden death			1
@entity7 , pictured with his mother @entity18 , is not allowed to play outdoors or get over-excited whle he waits for treatment for a rare cardiac condtion he 's not even allowed to play outside with his brothers @entity22 , 14 , and @entity23 , 12 , and sister @entity24 , 6			1
@entity7 was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia after he collapsed earlier this year			1
the rare condition in children means his resting heart rate is 120 to 200 beats per minute - at least twice as fast as the average person			1
ventricular tachycardia is caused by faulty electrical signals in the lower heart chambers known as ventricles			1
these override the heart 's normal rate and rhythm causing the ventricles to contract faster than normal			1
this causes the heart to pump out blood more quickly and the ventricles may not have enough time to fill up properly with blood			1
it can cause chest pain , dizziness and fainting fits			2
it can be corrected by a course of tablets or an operation but has also proved to be fatal in some child cases			2
if the condition worsens the heart can go into ventricular fibrillation , where the brain and muscles stop receiving blood from the heart			1
@entity7 , from @entity59 , @entity60 , will have a preliminary examination in the next few weeks before doctors decide what action to take			1
@entity7 has gone up two ages in clothes sizes due to forced inactivity mother @entity68 , 34 , said @entity7 collapsed and was rushed to hospital in may this year after playing and joking around with his brother			1
she said : ' now we have to be so careful that he does n't get over excited			0
even if he 's laughing too hard we have to calm him down and make sure he does n't get too worked up			2
' i remember that he used to run up to me and say ' mum my heart feels like it 's going to jump out of my chest '			1
' i 'd always dismiss it and tell him it was only natural because he 'd been running around			0
' then one day he was playing with his brother @entity23 out in the field next to the house when he fell down			0
' @entity23 thought he had fallen and smacked his head so he helped him up and they came into the kitchen together			0
' by this time @entity7 was screaming in pain and then he was violently sick			1
my husband @entity84 rushed him to @entity85 and initially they thought he had a heart murmur			2
' it was only when he had further checks that they discovered he had ventricular tachycardia			0
' @entity91 : usually electrical signals start in the sinus node and travel through the heart making it contract			2
the signals travel from the atria ( upper chambers ) to the ventricles ( lower chambers ) through the atrioventricular node			0
ventricular tachycardia occurs when the electrical signals in the ventricles become disorganised and override this process @entity7 is now on doctors orders to stay in on the @entity105 instead of running around outside			1
mrs @entity68 said : ' at the moment he ca n't do any physical exercise			0
he has had to sit out on @entity109 lessons and he ca n't play with his brothers			0
' he 's been bouncing off the walls , you do n't realise how difficult it is to keep a seven year old quiet and calm			2
' we 've had to buy him a @entity115 to try and keep him occupied but it 's not ideal			2
' @entity7 has gone up at least two ages in clothes size since the diagnosis and we are a bit worried about how big he is getting			1
' the mother - of - four said their months of worry could soon be coming to an end as they wait for doctors to tell them what course of action to take			0
medicines like beta - blockers are often prescribed			0
if these do n't work , a device can be implanted under the skin near the collarbone that monitors the heartbeat and produces electrical signals to correct any ventricular tachycardia episodes			0
mrs @entity68 said : ' we have been put on a 10 - week waiting list but we are hopeful that he will have an operation in the next few weeks			0
' we will be so relieved when it is over			0
the consequences of what could have happened if we had n't discovered the problem are n't worth thinking about			0
he could have just dropped dead			0
' even the nurses told me not to research too much about it because they knew it would upset me			0
' the condition is unusual in children and usually occurs in older patients who have experienced a heart attack			2
mrs @entity68 said : ' this problem has just come out of the blue			0
' when doctors have taken his pulse recently they 've all commented on his heart rate			1
' but he 's had his pulse taken before and it 's always been normal			2
i 'm just glad we realised something was wrong when we did			0

@entity7 's resting heart rate could reach three times that of an average person
