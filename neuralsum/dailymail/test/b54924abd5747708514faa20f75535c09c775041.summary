@entity0 must use his current spell out of the @entity3 side as a catalyst to come back a stronger goalkeeper , according to former club legend @entity6			1
@entity0 has found himself demoted to the substitutes ' bench in recent months due to a combination of poor performances and the form of @entity12 since the new year			1
@entity14 boss @entity13 has benefited from competition for places brought by the £ 3.2 million signing of @entity18 @entity12 from @entity19 last summer , as eight consecutive wins have lifted his side to second in the @entity22			1
@entity0 has n't played a @entity22 game since the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity25 in january @entity12 boasts the highest win ratio of any @entity22 player to make more than 10 appearances @entity0 is expected to line up in goal for @entity3 in saturday 's @entity31 semi-final against @entity32 at @entity33 , and @entity6 believes the @entity34 international can make the number one jersey his own once more			1
' with @entity38 , it must be hard for him now to be number two , coming off the back of a season where he was a regular and had been playing at his best , but it is totally just because he had a couple of bad mistakes and @entity44 has gone in and done his stuff , ' @entity6 said			2
' either of them could be @entity3 's number one , it is about who is on form - and if @entity44 keeps his form , then he is going to stay there			2
' former @entity3 goalkeeper @entity6 was speaking as an ambassador for the ' @entity56 ' campaign against bowel cancer to @entity58			1
@entity0 compounded his indifferent on - field performances by being caught smoking in the showers after defeat at @entity25 on @entity63 - the last time the 24 - year - old started a league game for the @entity66			2
but @entity6 has every faith in the 6ft 5in deposed keeper , believing that if @entity0 takes the positives from a spell on the sidelines , he can emerge a far better goalkeeper in the years to come			1
the 51 - year - old continued : ' it is not a difficult situation , but it keeps you on your toes to know that there is quality behind you			0
' it is not just the games which make you play better , it is the training			0
' the goalkeepers train together , and you see the other guy , you think " i want to be better than him " or " i am going to show him how good i am "			0
that is day to day and is good because it brings the best out of you and tests you , so you become a better goalkeeper			0
' @entity6 is a former @entity94 goalkeeper who joined @entity3 from @entity95 in 1990 for £ 1.3m , a then @entity97 record transfer fee for a goalkeeper			1
he spent 13 seasons at the @entity14 , winning the old @entity100 and the @entity22 twice			2
@entity6 also won four @entity101 , a @entity102 and the @entity103 during his time at @entity105			0
in all , he made 564 appearances for the @entity14 between 1990 and 2003 , before joining @entity107 on a free transfer			0
a return of 11 wins from 12 starts has turned @entity12 into a fans ' favourite at the @entity114 , but @entity6 is only too aware of how quickly things can change in football , and has urged @entity0 to think carefully before making a decision on his future			1
' @entity38 has a big choice now , but he has still got loads of time , i did not join @entity3 until i was 26 , ' said @entity6 , who left @entity3 for @entity107 in 2003 after leading the @entity14 to @entity31 glory over @entity25 at the @entity124			1
' it is about how he reacts , and what does the player want - does he want to play as a number one ? or is he happy being at a big club as a number two ? ' it is all about his ambition			0
if he wants to be a number one somewhere , then how long is he going to have to wait ? ' but if he leaves @entity3 , then it wo n't be the same level , because it is not until after they go , that all these guys realise how good @entity3 is			0
' when did @entity12 join @entity3 ? @entity3 signed @entity12 from @entity138 side @entity19 last summer			1
the 26 - year - old made close to 200 appearances for the @entity142 club during six seasons			0
how much did @entity3 pay for him ? originally signed as back - up and competition for @entity0 after the @entity14 no 2 @entity147 joined @entity148 , @entity12 cost a paltry £ 3million			1
is he of international calibre ? @entity12 had won 52 caps for @entity151 and impressed during their run to the @entity155 quarter - final in @entity156 last summer			0
when did @entity44 make his first appearance for @entity3 ? @entity12 made his debut for @entity3 in a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity25 in the third round of the @entity102 back in september and only made one further appearance in the @entity162 before 2015			2
when did he displace @entity0 as no 1 ? @entity12 was recalled to the starting line - up as @entity3 beat @entity164 2 - 0 in the @entity31 third round in january after @entity0 was at fault for both goals during a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity25			1
it later emerged that the @entity34 goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game			0
@entity12 kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every @entity22 match since			2
did you know ... @entity44 is brother - in - law to @entity179 midfielder and @entity151 team - mate @entity180			0
the former @entity182 star married @entity12 's sister @entity183 in 2011 .			0
