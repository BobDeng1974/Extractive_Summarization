by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 05:27 est , 6 april 2012 it sparked a nationwide treasure hunt in the 1970s			1
now @entity3 , creator of the masquerade mystery , has challenged the public to another riddle – and this time even he does n’t know the answer			1
the artist is appealing for the return of a bracelet made by him which was stolen by burglars 18 months ago , the only other piece of jewellery he ever made aside from his iconic golden hare amulet			1
missing : @entity16 is desperate to see the return of his precious 22 carat gold bracelet which was stolen and a £ 5,000 reward is on offer for its return the hare gained cult status after he buried it in the ground 33 years ago and published a children ’s book containing clues as to its whereabouts			1
it is currently on display at the @entity32 as part of an exhibition of the best @entity36 designs of the 20th and 21st centuries			1
a reward of £ 5,000 has been offered to anyone who can find the bracelet , which was created soon after the hare amulet			1
mystery : those who searched for the elusive golden hare from the @entity46 mystery will finally be able to see it up close - when it goes on public display for the very first time popular : @entity3 's children 's story masquerade was a publishing sensation , selling almost a million copies when it appeared in 1979 @entity3 , now 65 , crafted the gold bangle , featuring a frog and a linnet , for a friend to give to his wife as an anniversary present			1
but it was taken when thieves raided the couple 's home in @entity65 – and now it is feared it may be lost forever			1
although it may have been melted down for scrap metal , the artist hopes it may still exist somewhere in @entity36			1
he said : ' the burglars may well have been kids or drug addicts			1
' they probably just picked it up because it was small and easy to carry away			2
i 'm certain they had no idea what it was			2
' the most likely scenario is that it has been melted down for scrap metal			1
' my only hope is that someone at the gold processors twigged that it was more interesting than just a bit of gold and decided to preserve it			1
' it 's the only piece of jewellery i 've ever made aside from the golden hare , but i 'd be surprised if it still exists			2
' they had no way of knowing it was made by me so wo n't know the significance			2
' the bracelet , which is made of 100grms of 22 carat gold , is engraved with the phrase , ' @entity96 , no manacle made of me			1
' on display : the amulet , created by artist @entity3 , is to be shown at the @entity32 as part of a new design exhibition			2
in a rare interview , he said he was glad his fans would finally have the chance to see it reunited : @entity3 and @entity106 , riight , with the @entity107 that they buried together in 1979 @entity3 made it for his @entity110 friend in 1984 , along with an oval casket made from mahogany and a garnet set on top which would open the container if moved in a certain way			2
the two animals make up the clasp , with the linnet carrying a ruby on its head which would open the bracelet when pressed			1
@entity3 said the couple , who want to remain anonymous , are offering the reward because it is of deep sentimental value to them			2
finders keepers : poster promoting the finding the hare in the 1970s - the hare was the prize for winning the puzzle from the book masquerade by @entity3 he added : ' there is a special story that i created to accompany the bracelet			1
' there 's a saying that the frog is the @entity110 's nightingale , i suppose because it 's quite marshy in @entity143			2
' so the story is that a frog and a linnet decide to have a singing contest – and against all odds , the frog wins			0
why ? because the judge was a @entity110			0
