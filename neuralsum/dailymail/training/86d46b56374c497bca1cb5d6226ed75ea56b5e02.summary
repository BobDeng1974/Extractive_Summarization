by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 16:52 est , 3 august 2013 thousands of critically ill patients face longer journey times to hospital under controversial plans to close accident and emergency units , an official report has admitted			1
a third of all 999 ambulances will be delayed because of the closure of four emergency departments in @entity12 , while pensioners and poorer people will be ‘ disproportionately ’ affected by the proposed changes , the report found			1
campaigners and doctors fighting to keep the units open last night said that the review confirmed their fears that lives would be put at risk			1
closures : @entity26 's @entity25 department is one of four that will be closed in @entity12			1
a report shows it will take longer to get to hospital			1
campaigners say lives will be put at risk as a result @entity25 departments are set to go at @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 hospitals under the @entity42 programme			1
it will almost halve the number of emergency departments in the area – from ten to six – which doctors say will leave remaining facilities swamped			1
the @entity49 - – @entity50 found that : 33 per cent of ‘ blue light ’ ambulances across the area will take longer to reach hospital			1
among those picking up patients from poorer areas , 41 per cent will take longer			2
the four @entity59 set to close are all in deprived parts of the capital			2
elderly , poorer and disabled people who need non-urgent care will be ‘ disproportionately ’ affected			2
seven in ten people travelling by bus or tube will have journey times of 30 minutes or more			2
@entity69 managers paid global management consultancy @entity70 to carry out the review			2
it was ordered to gauge whether the hospital ‘ reconfiguration ’ plan would make it more difficult for some patients			2
under the @entity77 , public organisations are obliged to ensure they are serving all equally , regardless of age , sex , race or sexual orientation			2
the study also included social deprivation			0
the report warned that closures ‘ will give rise to additional journey times ’			0
it said hospital bosses should regard travel times as a ‘ key concern ’ , advising : ‘ some warnings do need to be raised about the prospect of longer and more complex journey times			0
’ closures could damage ‘ continuity of care ’ , particularly for children			0
well - developed services at @entity26 to help @entity101 ’s large @entity100 community , which suffers high levels of poor health , would also be lost			0
@entity104 , leader of @entity105 , said last night : ‘ this report confirms everything that we have been saying right from the beginning about the dangers posed to patients			0
’ dangerous : the planned closures will halve the number of emergency departments in the area from ten to six			1
a review shows elderly and poor people will be the most affected because the four @entity25 units are all in deprived parts of @entity12 the report ’s authors believe no ambulances will take more than an extra ten minutes to reach an @entity25 after the closures , due to take place over the next three to five years			1
but dr @entity124 , chair of the @entity126 health committee , believed their calculations were wrong			0
and he added : ‘ there is clear evidence that when travel times are increased , mortality rates go up			0
’ @entity69 bosses argue that closing the @entity59 and replacing them with @entity133 will end up saving lives , because the remaining units will be better staffed , particularly at nights and weekends			1
they also say it is necessary to save money			0
a spokesman for the @entity42 programme said : ‘ it is true that some groups will be affected more than others in terms of travel , but the advantages of getting much better treatment , at a better facility able to provide care specifically aimed at their communities , will far outweigh this			0
delays : 41 per cent of ambulances picking patients up from deprived areas in the city will take longer because of the closures the report has come to light days after a high court judge ruled that health secretary @entity161 had acted unlawfully in choosing to downgrade another casualty unit			1
mr @entity161 had accepted an official ’s recommendation to shut @entity25 to help save neighbouring @entity165 from financial meltdown			0
mr @entity167 said both mr @entity161 and @entity168 , the special administrator , had acted outside their legal powers			0
dr @entity124 said @entity25 campaigners had been ‘ heartened ’ by the news .			0

four emergency departments will be closed in @entity12
as a result a third of all 999 ambulances will be delayed
remaining emergency facilities will be swamped
