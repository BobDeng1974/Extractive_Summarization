do you find yourself checking your phone every few seconds , waiting for the ping of an email or the beep of a text ? if so , chances are that you ’re an addict			1
and as with all addictions , the best thing to do is seek treatment			0
luckily , the first digital device detox centre to rehabilitate phone and internet addicts has sprung up in the @entity14 countryside			2
unplugged weekend is designed as a digital detox for people stressed out with lives attached to their phones , and includes activities such as life drawing , hiking and yoga aptly called ‘ @entity15 ’ , it is nestled in the heart of the @entity25 and runs festival - style weekends to help phone obsessives reconnect with real life			1
the camp - style set - up , which is imported from the @entity31 where it has taken off , is designed to help wean addicts off their devices and discover nature			0
but deliverance from your digital demons does n’t come cheap			0
a weekend at the retreat in the @entity25 will set you back £ 199			2
however , for many parents with teenagers who are constantly glued to their phones , it may be the best option , given worrying statistics on phone use			2
last week , communications watchdog @entity46 revealed that we spend nearly nine hours a day using our smartphones , laptops , tablets and other devices			0
other stats show that we check our phones an average of 150 times a day , according to a @entity57 survey			0
the rehab begins on a friday with everyone dropping their smartphones into a black trunk which is passed around the group			0
set in the @entity25 in @entity14 , the retreat begins with everyone handing over their phones which are kept in a locked black box until they leave again days at the retreat begin with yoga and meditation at 7am , followed by a ‘ group sharing experience ’ in which everyone talks about their addiction			1
life drawing , rambling walks through the @entity79 and laughter therapy are just a few of the activities on offer to help distract visitors from their phones			2
describing the weekend , the website says : ‘ @entity15 is a digital detox set in the countryside , so we ’ll all be locking away our phones for a couple of days while we get on with having a good time			1
‘ we will do a group phone surrendering ceremony on the friday evening to mark the start of the weekend and you will be reunited with your devices on sunday when you leave			1
this is a tech free weekend			0
’ the rehab centre was set up by @entity96 , 26 , and @entity97 , 28 , from @entity98 , after they met on a retreat in the @entity102 desert earlier this year			1
unable to use their phones due to lack of signal , the advertising workers realised how liberating it was and quit their jobs to start the retreat			1
‘ being in the middle of the dunes , we did n't have any phone signal for a week - it was great			1
that 's when we realised the benefits of having a break from being constantly tuned in , ’ they said			0
research shows that on average people now spend more time per day on digital devices than they do on sleep ‘ so when we got back to @entity98 we put our heads together and @entity15 was born			1
’ ‘ we realised that the differentiating thing about our experience [ in the @entity102 ] was that we did n’t have our phones and nobody was chasing us for anything , ’ miss @entity97 told the @entity121			1
‘ you ’re so caught up in the stress of life and you ’re thinking all the time but not about the important stuff - like whether you ’re happy			0
’ one visitor to the centre , @entity133 , who has just finished her first year at @entity135 , told the @entity121 : ‘ you realise how much of a social barrier having a phone is			2
‘ any time i ’m anxious in a social situation i get my phone out and pretend to play a game or reply to all these text messages i ’m supposed to have got , but because you ca n’t do that here you actually talk to people			0
’ another visitor , @entity146 , said : ‘ the first thing i do in the morning is check @entity149 in bed , then i get distracted and i can be on it for hours without realising			0
