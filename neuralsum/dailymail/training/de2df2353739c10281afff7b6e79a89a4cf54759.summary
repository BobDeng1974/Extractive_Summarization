by @entity0 @entity1 produced a near flawless final round to clinch a two - shot victory in the opening @entity5 play - off at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity1 rose to the occasion on the back nine , with five birdies moving him steadily up the leaderboard and he could even afford to bogey the last , his only blemish of an otherwise fantastic display			1
a closing six - under 65 saw him finish comfortably ahead of @entity14 compatriot @entity13 and @entity16 duo @entity15 and @entity17 , who was joint overnight leader			1
' this is a @entity5 play - off event , this is where all the best players are			1
you need to peak your game and play some great golf and to do it on a sunday like i did and hit some great shots and big putts down the end feels great , ' he said			2
' i felt good in the last few weeks			2
i felt like i turned a corner from myself and refocused myself on doing the right things			0
' it feels great to get a ' w '			0
' victory : the round sealed a first @entity34 victory for @entity1 since 2012 by two shots from day , @entity55 and @entity15 with nine players having already qualified for @entity14 's @entity30 team , @entity1 's effort this weekend may go a long way to earning a wildcard spot in @entity62 's team for the event in @entity64 next month			1
the 32 - year - old from @entity66 has made two appearances for the @entity14 but missed out on selection two years ago			1
however , he made it clear he would welcome a wildcard spot			2
' it 's the goal of every @entity14 and @entity73 player to play in the @entity30			1
it means so much to us on both sides , ' he added on @entity77 4			0
' it 's such a great competition that everyone loves to play against one another			0
it brings out the best in everyone			0
it 'd be a huge bonus to be a part of the team			0
' solid : although his winning streak came to an end , @entity89 's 70 did secure him a tie of 22nd place @entity1 started brightly with two birdies in his opening five holes but a run of five successive pars left his chances of glory floundering			1
he exploded into life from the 11th , however , with a run of five birdies in seven holes , and his putt on the 17th , 21ft from the pin , brought the crowd to their feet			0
a poor tee shot at his final hole kept them on the edge of their seats and he was lucky to avoid a bunker on his approach , with the ball nestling in the rough just above the sand			0
while he was unable to save par , he did hold his nerve to hole a tricky putt			0
out : @entity124 finished the tournament level par but will not qualify for the second play - off day needed an eagle on the last to enforce a play - off but he too found the rough with his tee shot and with that his hopes vanished , settling for joint second after a closing 68			0
fellow @entity16 @entity15 also finished on 12 under for the tournament after matching @entity1 's round , with @entity13 carding a closing 66			2
world number one @entity89 finished in a tie for 22nd after a one - under 70 , while @entity137 's @entity124 was among the 25 players to fail to qualify for the second play - off event at the @entity140 , despite finishing level par for the tournament after a closing 70 .			1

@entity1 cards a 65 to win in @entity7
win puts him in pole position to take the Â£ 6million @entity5 prize
@entity14 could be in line for a wildcard sport at @entity30
@entity151 1 @entity89 finishes tied 22nd
