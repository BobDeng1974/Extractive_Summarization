by @entity0 a @entity3 woman who indicated on her @entity5 form that she was in a ' friends with benefits ' relationship with her housemate will be able to keep receiving @entity5 payments , a tribunal has ruled			1
the welfare agency tried to deny the 46 - year - old woman her carer 's allowance , because it believed she was in a romantic and financially dependent relationship with her housemate , with whom she admitted she sometimes had sex			1
this decision was overruled today by the @entity19 in @entity3 , who decreed that ' friends with benefits ' did not count as a relationship and therefore the woman should have received her payments in full			2
a woman was refused @entity5 payments to pay for the care of her sick mother , because she wrote on the @entity5 form that she was in a ' friends with benefits ' relationship with her housemate the woman , known as ms t , claimed an allowance in 2012 when she became the carer for her sick mother			1
@entity5 ruled she was ineligible because it believed that mr @entity36 , her housemate , was ms t 's live - in - lover , meaning their combined income put her over the threshold to receive payments			0
ms @entity43 appealed to the @entity19 claiming that while they sometimes slept together , she and mr @entity36 were not exclusive and she often met other men through online dating sites for ' physical companionship '			1
she told the court that at the age of 46 , with two failed relationships in her past , she wanted to ' enjoy her life ' , reported the @entity53			0
the tribunal ruled in favour of the woman , who claimed that since she and her housemate were n't committed she should keep receiving payments tribunal member @entity58 said that since ms @entity43 and mr @entity36 had separate rooms in the house , were financially independent and had no joint assets , there was no reason to believe they were in a relationship			0
' importantly , it was noted that at no time did mr @entity36 support ms t , ' he said			0
he added that ms t 's openness about seeing other men also indicated the couple were not in a de facto relationship			1
' when considering a normal de facto relationship it would be unusual , in the tribunal 's opinion , for such actions to occur with such regularity			2
' however , mr @entity58 said @entity5 's confusion was understandable , because when filling out her forms ms @entity43 indicated that she was part of a couple			0
in the section of the form where the applicant can indicate if they are married or de facto , ms @entity43 wrote : ' friends with benefits			2
' the tribunal , which met at the @entity91 in @entity3 ( pictured ) ruled that ms @entity92 should be paid the full amount , because she was n't in a committed relationship with her housemate and he did not support her financially			0
