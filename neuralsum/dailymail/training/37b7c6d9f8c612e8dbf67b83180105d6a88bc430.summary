such is the gulf in resources and quality now in the top division that a small , promoted club like @entity8 are always likely to falter			1
they did so last time they competed at this level in 2010			0
quite possibly , they will fail this season , too , despite saturday 's success			1
@entity27 still leaves them at the bottom of the table			0
but if effort , team spirit and the pragmatic but positive philosophy of manager @entity35 are true markers , they wo n’t go down without a fight			0

ratings from @entity95 at @entity3 ‘ in the first half i thought we were excellent , some of our play was very good , ’ said @entity35 , who saw fine performances from @entity62 , @entity47 and @entity7 in particular			1
‘ we had enough chances to be one if not two goals to the good			0
it might sound off but i gave the lads a bit of stick at half time			2
‘ we know “ alright ” is not enough , we need to do even better			0
‘ then we scored and it was a bit nervy after that , but that ’s natural			2
a marker is laid down , you get your first win and everyone feels better			2
’ @entity47 laid on the goal with what @entity35 rightly described as a ‘ fantastic cross that led to a great header ’			1
but @entity35 insisted he will not get carried away			0
‘ it is not about one win			2
it ’s great and do n’t get me wrong , i ’ll enjoy it			0
‘ but there will be more than one win needed			2
’ he did agree , however , that these three points are ‘ important psychologically ’ and will help instil the belief that @entity8 ‘ can make the impossible possible ’			2
in other words , avoid relegation			0
the next few games will give a clearer picture of whether that is possible — against @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
‘ there are two or even three divisions within this division and we know where ours is , ’ said @entity35 , acknowledging that survival in itself would be a great achievement			0
‘ we know the challenges in front of us			0
’ @entity146 , @entity35 ’s opposing manager , was brutally frank about his team ’s below - par display			1
‘ it ’s very rare in the two - and - a - half years i ’ve been at the club that i can say i feel embarrassed and say sorry to supporters who have travelled in their thousands to see that , ’ he said			2
‘ that i made all three substitutions before 60 minutes shows you ( how we needed inspiration )			0
