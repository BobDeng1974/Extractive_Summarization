@entity0 was branded hypocritical today for leaving the lights on at its near - empty headquarters overnight - 24 hours after it warned @entity4 it faced a power crisis			1
on tuesday its bosses said capacity to supply electricity this winter is at its lowest since 2007 , which means there could be a series of ' brownouts ' this winter that could dim the lights in millions of homes			1
but the message has not got through to management who left their vast estate in @entity22 ' lit up like a christmas tree ' after dark			1
it came as its experts admitted @entity4 faces its greatest risk of power shortages in eight years following the closure of coal - fired power stations to meet @entity32 carbon reduction targets			0
' when we leave our office we make sure the lights are switched off but these people should definitely know better			0
' it 's a real kick in the teeth for hard - working members of the @entity4 public when they announce that we might have our lights dimmed this winter while they are leaving theirs on at night			1
' it reeks of hypocrisy - it 's just not on			0
' the photos were taken at 7.30pm on yesterday and show bright lights coming from every window of @entity67 in @entity22			0
an empty boardroom with some lights left on is also visible and other images show vast car parks with barely any vehicles left in them lit up by a series of street lamps			2
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' @entity0 is responsible for making sure the country has a reliable energy supply at all times			1
to do this , staff work on a number of shift patterns meaning @entity67 is in use 24 hours a day , seven days week			0
the building itself has many energy conserving measures including sensor controlled lighting which turns itself off automatically if a room is empty '			1
their is a stark contrast to the gloomy message put out by the @entity0 on tuesday			2
wasteful : the photos were taken at 7.30pm on yesterday and show bright lights coming from every window of @entity67 in @entity22 contrast : @entity96 is taking emergency measures , including paying large factories to turn off their machines during peak periods this winter , in order to keep the lights on across @entity4 empty : one of the vast site 's kitchens and a nearby meeting room remained well lit after office hours last night defence : @entity0 says it runs a 24 hour operation from the headquarters and the buildings have light - saving features it is taking emergency measures , including paying large factories to turn off their machines during peak periods this winter , in order to keep the lights on			1
separately , it plans to pay energy firms millions of pounds to switch on three back - up power stations to cope with high demand if there is a big freeze			0
despite this , the @entity0 warns it may be necessary to turn down the voltage in the cables to conserve supplies during some periods , which would lead to brownouts			1
energy experts say this would not only dim the lights but could also interfere with electronic equipment , computers and electric clocks			0
the gap between the electricity the nation 's power stations and wind farms can produce and demand in an average winter will be 4.1per cent , which is the lowest level in eight years			2
however , this safety margin would be wiped out for some periods in december and january if the @entity4 suffers the sort of cold winter that is seen once every 20 years			0
major energy users say the situation provides damning evidence that the race to close coal fired power stations and switch to wind farms has failed to deliver a reliable power supply			0
dr @entity153 , of the @entity154 , said : ' the prospect of energy shortages and rolling blackouts â€“ for factories - is simply unacceptable , as they may cause major disruption for @entity4 businesses '			2
@entity0 and politicians insist there is no chance of homes completely losing power - with energy secretary @entity166 saying : ' there will be no blackouts			2

@entity0 says that it runs a 24 - hour operation from @entity189 and buildings have energy - saving *technology*
