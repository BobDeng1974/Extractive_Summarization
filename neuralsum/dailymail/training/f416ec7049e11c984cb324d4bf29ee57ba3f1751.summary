last week , scientists announced the discovery of @entity2 , a planet 492 light years away in the @entity5 constellation			2
@entity2 is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as @entity8 orbiting in the ‘ habitable zone ’ – the distance from a star in which we might expect liquid water , and perhaps life			1
what did not make the news , however , is that this discovery also slightly increases how much credence we give to the possibility of imminent human extinction			0
last week , astronomers said they had discovered a planet called @entity2 , artist 's impression pictured			0
@entity2 is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as @entity8 orbiting in the ' habitable zone ' this because of a concept known as the @entity28			2
the @entity28 is an argument that attempts to resolve the @entity30 : why have we not found aliens , despite the existence of hundreds of billions of solar systems in our galactic neighbourhood in which life might evolve ? as the namesake physicist @entity38 noted , it seems rather extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - @entity42 conspiracy theorists notwithstanding			1
this apparent absence of thriving extraterrestrial civilisations suggests that at least one of the steps from humble planet to interstellar civilisation is exceedingly unlikely			2
this image of @entity50 - 186f based on what the astronomers expect it might look like			2
plant life is yellow due to the manner in which it reflects light from the star but the water and clouds would probably be more orange the @entity28 is an argument that attempts to resolve the @entity30			1
this paradox questions why have we not found aliens , despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve			2
physicist @entity38 believed it to extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected			0
he claims there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent , self - aware , technologically advanced , space - colonising civilisations			1
we can think of this barrier as a ‘ @entity28 ’			1
the absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct			1
the absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct			1
this bottleneck for the emergence of alien civilisations from any one of the many billions of planets is referred to as the @entity28			1
what exactly is causing this bottleneck has been the subject of debate for more than 50 years			0
explanations could include a paucity of @entity8 - like planets or self - replicating molecules			2
other possibilities could be an improbable jump from simple prokaryotic life - cells without specialised parts - to more complex eukaryotic life			1
after all , this transition took well over a billion years on @entity8			0
proponents of this ‘ @entity8 ’ hypothesis also argue that the evolution of complex life requires an exceedingly large number of perfect conditions			2
in addition to @entity8 being in the habitable zone of the sun , our star must be far enough away from the galactic centre to avoid destructive radiation , our gas giants must be massive enough to sweep asteroids from @entity8 ’s trajectory , and our unusually large moon stabilises the axial tilt that gives us different seasons			0
these are just a few prerequisites for complex life			2
the emergence of symbolic language , tools and intelligence could require other such ‘ perfect conditions ’ as well			0
physicist @entity38 noted that it seems extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - @entity42 conspiracy theorists notwithstanding according to the @entity28 theory , discovering life on another planet in a solar system would suggest that the emergence of life is not that rare			1
if it happened independently twice in a solar system , it must have happened millions times across the galaxy			2
this would mean that the @entity28 is less likely to occur in the early life of planets and is therefore more likely still to come			1
if the @entity28 is still to arrive , it would mean that there is some great event - such as its possible demise - that would prevent humanity from travelling to other parts of the galaxy			1
while emergence of intelligent life could be rare , the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long			1
might every sufficiently advanced civilisation stumble across a suicidal technology or unsustainable trajectory ? we know that a @entity28 prevents the emergence of prosperous interstellar civilisations , but we do n’t know whether or not it lies in humanity ’s past or awaits us in the future			1
for 200,000 years humanity has survived supervolcanoes , asteroid impacts , and naturally occurring pandemics			2
but our track record of survival is limited to just a few decades in the presence of nuclear weaponry			0
and we have no track record at all of surviving many of the radically novel technologies that are likely to arrive this century			0
esteemed scientists such as astronomer royal @entity178 at the @entity180 point to advances in biotechnology as being potentially catastrophic			0
while emergence of intelligent life could be rare , the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long others such as @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , also with the @entity191 , have expressed serious concern about the exotic but understudied possibility of machine superintelligence			1
let ’s hope kepler - 186f is barren			0
when the @entity30 was initially proposed , it was thought that planets themselves were rare			0
since then , however , the tools of astronomy have revealed the existence of hundreds of exoplanets			0
that just seems to be the tip of the iceberg			0
but each new discovery of an @entity8 - like planet in the habitable zone , such as @entity2 , makes it less plausible that there are simply no planets aside from @entity8 that might support life			2
@entity50 is a space observatory launched by @entity215 to discover @entity8 - like planets orbiting other stars			0
data from @entity50 could help humans find alien life the @entity28 is thus more likely to be lurking in the path between habitable planet and flourishing civilisation			1
if kepler - 186f is teeming with intelligent life , then that would be really bad news for humanity			1
for that fact would push back the @entity28 ’s position further into the technological stages of a civilisation ’s development			1
we might then expect that catastrophe awaits both our extraterrestrial companions and ourselves			1
in the case of @entity2 , we still have many reasons to think intelligent life might not emerge			1
the atmosphere might be too thin to prevent freezing , or the planet might be tidally locked , causing a relatively static environment			0
discovery of these hostile conditions should be cause for celebration			0
as philosopher @entity251 once said : ‘ the silence of the night sky is golden … in the search for extraterrestrial life , no news is good news			0
it promises a potentially great future for humanity			0
’ @entity256 works at the @entity257			0
this article was originally published on @entity259 .			0

scientists claim there must a barrier that prevents rise of intelligent life
barrier - known as the @entity28 - could be in past or awaiting humanity
if we find intelligent life , it would mean the @entity28 is still *ahead* of us
this suggests an event will occur to prevent humanity – and perhaps all technological civilisations – from travelling to other parts of the galaxy
we might then expect that catastrophe awaits both aliens and ourselves
