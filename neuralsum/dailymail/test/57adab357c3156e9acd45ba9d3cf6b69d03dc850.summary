a new mother who ' died ' for 11 minutes during her son 's birth woke up four days later with no memory of ever being pregnant or having her baby			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was technically dead for a terrifying 11 minutes after suffering a severe cardiac arrest as her son , @entity9 , was being born			1
the 41 - year - old woke up four days later , with absolutely no idea that she had been pregnant , or that she had given birth to @entity9 just days earlier			1
it was only when she saw a picture of her new baby wearing her children 's hand - me - downs that she realised he was her son			2
@entity5 had a cardiac arrest during a caesarean section and ' died ' for 11 minutes			1
when she woke up , she had no idea she had been pregnant or given birth to her son @entity9 ( pictured now at nine months old ) mrs @entity5 only realised she had a son when someone showed her a picture of @entity9 wearing a baby grow that her other children had worn when they were born , and it ' clicked ' that he was her son the mother - of - three has defied the odds and made a remarkable recovery , despite being given just a 30 per cent chance of survival and an 85 per cent possibility of brain damage			1
mrs @entity5 , a translator , said : ' when i woke up , my friends and family would talk to me about @entity9 , but i had no idea what they were on about			1
' i was trying to make sense out of everything - i did n't know where i was or what had happened - i had no idea that i 'd ever been pregnant or just had a baby			2
' it was n't until my sister showed me a picture of @entity9 that things very slowly started to fall into place			0
her older sons , @entity53 , six , and @entity54 , four , had both worn a white baby grow with blue piping when they were newborns			0
' @entity9 was wearing it in the picture - so i thought he must have been mine , ' said mrs @entity5			2
' i knew no one else would have one like it , so when i saw him wearing it , i thought he must be mine			0
' i made the conscious decision to believe what everyone was telling me , even though i 'm not quite sure i 'd accepted it just yet			0
' an amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs when amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds a baby in the uterus during pregnancy — or fetal material , such as hair , enters the maternal bloodstream			1
an amniotic fluid embolism is most likely to occur during childbirth or immediately afterward			1
signs and symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism might include : source : @entity83 she added : ' when i met him when he was six days old , i did n't really feel like he was mine - i was n't interested in holding him , and i was happy for my mum to give him cuddles instead of me			1
' it was n't until i was well enough to go back to the maternity ward and could breastfeed @entity9 that i really started to bond with him			0
' slowly , vague memories of being pregnant and giving birth returned , and i gradually started to feel the instinct to look after him			1
' now , @entity9 and i have a wonderful relationship , and the whole ordeal almost feels like a dream			0
' mrs @entity5 suffered an amniotic fluid embolism			1
this is where the amniotic fluid – the liquid inside the sac in which the baby grows - or other matter from the foetus , such as hair , cells or other debris , gets into the mother 's bloodstream			1
the condition can lead to seizures , coma , and cardiac arrest , where electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic and it suddenly stops pumping blood around the body			1
mrs @entity5 had been in labour for 12 hours when doctors decided to perform a @entity122			1
just as @entity9 , now nine months , was being lifted out of the womb , mrs @entity5 went into cardiac arrest			1
she said : ' i remember feeling sick , and seconds later i had a cardiac arrest			1
' they did cpr on me for 11 minutes and i had adrenaline injected into my heart			1
' i lost four fifths of my blood because they had n't finished the surgery on my c - section - i had to have a blood transfusion and was put on life support			0
' i woke up four days later and had no idea what was going on - all i knew was that i was in a lot of pain			2
mrs @entity5 was given just a 30 per cent chance of survival			1
thankfully she made a remarkable recovery and is now at home with her family ( ( from left to right ) @entity9 , @entity54 , four , @entity53 , six , and husband @entity143 mrs @entity5 can only remember vague details of being pregnant or @entity9 's birth			1
but he is now a ' perfectly healthy , smiley little baby ' , she said , and they are ' completely bonded ' ' i was trying to make sense of everything around me , i thought maybe i was paralysed , or that i 'd died - i eventually decided that i must be having a nightmare			2
' i remember someone telling me that @entity9 was fine , but i was so confused - so many people would visit me and mention him , but i had no clue who they were talking about			0
' family and friends showed @entity5 photographs of her new son , but she remained confused and unable to recall any details about him			2
she said : ' i knew that the pain i was feeling was coming from my stomach , so when people talked about the baby , i thought it would make sense that my tummy hurt if i 'd just had a @entity122			0
' but i wrestled with the idea of believing it , because whilst it all made sense , i could n't remember			0
' my sister showed me a picture of @entity9 on her @entity173 , and when i saw the baby grow he was wearing , something clicked			0
' it was very strange - one minute i would have a grasp on reality , and the next i would be all over the place again			0
' mrs @entity5 finally met @entity9 for the first time when he was six days old , but she still struggled to accept that he was her baby			2
mrs @entity5 said she burst into tears when she saw @entity9 for the first time ( he is pictured in hospital )			2
she said : ' i was sad that such a little baby had been all on his own for the past week ' ' after that he was brought in once a day , but the bonding process only really began when i was able to breast feed him			0
' the nurses had used a breast pump on me while i was sedated , so i was still able to breast feed			0
' i was so pleased that my husband allowed the medics to do that - breast feeding is really important to me , and it allowed me to bond with @entity9			0
' i finally started to truly accept that he was mine			0
' after spending two weeks in hospital , mrs @entity5 and @entity9 returned home			2
' i can only vaguely remember my pregnancy and giving birth - some things come back to me , but i 'll see pictures of me before i had the baby , and i had no recollection of him			1
' the past 12 months are pretty hazy , but i have to accept that i may never get my memories back			0
' it 's bizarre to look back on what happened , it 's almost like a dream			0
' life is never going to be the same again - the day @entity9 was born was like a re-birthday for me because it 's given me a whole new perspective			0
' it 's made me realise how precious life is , and i 'm grateful for every single day i have			0
' mrs @entity5 will be cycling from @entity211 to @entity212 to raise money for @entity215 support and for the @entity217 which saved her life			2
