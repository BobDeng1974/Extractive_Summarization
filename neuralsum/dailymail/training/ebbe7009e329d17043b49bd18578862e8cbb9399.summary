ms @entity8 said she was left in fits of giggles after digging out ' mr @entity16 ' from the bag last week			2
saucy : the suggestive carrots were discovered by @entity8 as she fed her friend 's horses mr and mrs @entity22 : one looks like a man 's lower half while the other resembles a woman with her legs crossed the carrot appendage resembles a man 's lower half complete with his ' meat and two veg '			1
ms @entity8 then reached into the bag and found ' mrs carrot '			1
the retired home tutor said she laughed even more when she picked up the vegetable that looks like woman with her legs crossed			1

some even included mr @entity16 giving a rose to his beloved			0
humorous : @entity8 arrange the carrot couple in a range of positions before feeding them to the horses but , sadly for the vegetables , their shape did not spare them their fate for very long			1

' i did n't see the point in keeping them they were n't my carrots - they were for the horses			0
