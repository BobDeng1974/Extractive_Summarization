by @entity0 published : 06:32 est , 13 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:45 est , 13 february 2014 wind turbines may be considered an eco-friendly way to generate electricity , but they 're heavily criticised for blotting the landscape and killing hundreds of birds			0
@entity9 - based @entity8 has designed a bizarre - looking alternative to these bladed systems that uses a series of funnels and tubes			0
in its @entity18 turbine , winds as low as 2mph are directed into a funnel and through a tube to the turbine ’s generator on the ground			1
its @entity18 turbine , pictured , directs winds into a funnel and through a tube to the turbine 's generator on the ground			1
sheerwind claim it produces 600 % more energy than the traditional designs conventional wind turbines use turbine generator systems mounted on top of a tower			1
@entity18 , instead , funnels wind energy to ground - based generators			2
instead of catching energy from the wind as it passes through the blades of a rotor , @entity18 captures wind through a funnel			2
this wind is directed through a tapering passageway that naturally accelerates its flow			0
the stream of kinetic energy that is created then drives a generator			0
by channelling this wind through a passage that narrows at the end it creates a ‘ jet effect ’ , which increases the wind ’s velocity , but lowers the pressure			1
this technique creates kinetic energy and is called the @entity66			0
this kinetic energy turns the generator			0
@entity25 claims that due to this unique @entity71 - based system , the turbine works with wind speeds as low as 2mph			1
it can also produce 600 per cent more electrical energy ( @entity75 ) than blade systems by expanding the range of speeds at which it can operate			1

this technique creates kinetic energy and is called the @entity66 , pictured @entity25 claims that due to the unique @entity71 - based system and ground - based generators , the turbine works with wind speeds as low as 2mph			1
fewer generators are needed to generate equivalent energy , so equipment and maintenance costs are lower , too water - based systems already use the @entity66 , yet this is the first commercial use of it for converting wind energy			2
@entity25 states its system , pictured , is scalable , meaning a range of different sized versions can be placed on agricultural and hobby farms , industrial estates and even back gardens @entity25 also states its funnel system is scalable , meaning smaller versions could be placed on both agricultural and hobby farms , industrial estates and even in back gardens			1
it could also reduce the threat blade systems have on birds and bats			2
customers can request more details and fill in a form , specifying what kind of wind tower they want , at @entity25 's website			0
' conventional wind turbines use massive turbine generator systems mounted on top of a tower			0
@entity18 , by contrast , funnels wind energy to ground - based generators , ' said @entity25			2
' instead of snatching bits of energy from the wind as it passes through the blades of a rotor , wind is captured with a funnel and directed through a tapering passageway that naturally accelerates its flow			0
' this stream of kinetic energy then drives a generator that is installed safely and economically at ground level			0
’ @entity25 continued that the unit is 50 per cent shorter than traditional wind towers and uses a ground - based turbine with blades that are 84 per cent smaller			2
fewer generators are needed to generate equivalent energy , so equipment and maintenance costs are lower , too			0
@entity25 even claims @entity18 is ‘ competitive with natural gas and hydroelectric generation ’ because it costs less than a penny per kwh .			1

the @entity18 turbine directs wind through a funnel
this wind is passed through a tube towards the turbine ’s generator
the movement creates a ‘ jet effect ’ which increases the wind ’s velocity
@entity25 claims the turbine can work at speeds as low as 2mph
it produces 600 % more electrical energy than commercial blade systems
it is scalable meaning smaller versions could be used in back gardens
