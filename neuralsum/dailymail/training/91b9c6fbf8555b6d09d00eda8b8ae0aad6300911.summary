it *****'s***** hard to believe , but the @entity7 has been around for 42 years . more than *22* *million* have been made since 1973 . so this is the eighth generation . it *****'s***** a *proven* and *indefatigable* *workhorse* *****—***** the fact that the ***estate*** ********version******** ***comfort**ably* *outsells* the *svelte* **saloon** *testifies* to that .
*brits* *bought* *10,000* ***estate***s in 2013 , against *7,600* **saloon**s . the @entity7 is the **fourth** biggest *****************-***************** **selling** @entity15 here after the @entity41 .
used as much for work as for *leisure* and *pleasure* , these ***estate***s can take a *pounding* . this new ********version******** really does look and feel like the **business** , but is it more than just a *pretty* face ?
it certainly has *kerb* *appeal* with *elegant* *styling* . even the *doorman* at a *fivestar* @entity58 *hotel* *****—***** more used to *parking* @entity59 , and @entity60 *****—***** was moved *unprompted* to *comment* on how **smart** it *looked* .
goes from rest to *62mph* in *8.9* s*eco*nds *****—***** and *feels* *faster* as you go through the six *****************-***************** **speed** *manual* *gearbox* . *top* **speed** is **135*mph* .
five driving modes **include** **comfort** , *normal* , **sport** or ' *eco* ' . i kept it mainly on **sport** and *enjoyed* **plenty** of *power* when *needed* , yet with a *nimble* , well *****************-***************** *balanced* ride on all types of road .
*excellent* *eco*nomy . it *averaged* 6*8.9*mpg *****—***** *76.3mpg* when *cruising* and *59.9mpg* around town . *co2* *emissions* are a low 107g / *km.* an even more **frugal** @entity87 ********version******** arrives in *june* .
a s*top* *****************-***************** start ***system*** helps keep fuel *bills* low . there *****'s***** **keyless** entry , plus and *****heated***** ******seats****** and **steering** ***wheel*** for which , in this cold snap , i was very *grateful* .
*ample* *flexible* **interior** *space* ; **slightly** more than in the *outgoing* model , even though its *exterior* *dimensions* are **slightly** *smaller* . the three rear ******seats****** fold nearly flat for *extra* load *lugging* *capability* .
**smart** but *unfussy* **interior** , with *supportive* ******seats****** that have **plenty** of *reclining* and *setting* *options* to *ensure* **comfort** for drivers and *passengers* of all *shapes* and *sizes* . *stylish* *c**lot**h* *fabric* on the ******seats****** with *silver* *inserts* also add to the **business** *****************-***************** like feel .

**lot**s of *electronic* *kit* to keep you safe and *stable* on the road .
easy *****************-***************** to *****************-***************** read dials , but @entity15 *plans* an *optional* 12.3 in *display* to *replace* the *conventional* *instrument* *cluster* .
rear **cameras** make *reversing* into the *tightest* of *space*s much *easier* .
there may be a **lot** of *technology* on *board* but it *****'s***** *simply* *display*ed on an *uncluttered* dash*board* . the *touchscreen* is relatively easy to *navigate* .
for anyone *keen* on the *great* *outdoors* , a ' *trailer* *****************-***************** *assist* ' *feature* helps to *manoeuvre* *trailer*s more *accurately* .
only ***diesel*** models are on sale at first . a **frugal** plug *****************-***************** in *hybrid* @entity169 ********version******** with a *1.4* *****************-***************** litre @entity172 *petrol* and **electric** motor ********version******** is to follow in *october* , *promising* a *combined* range of more than *620* **miles** or 31 **miles** in pure **electric** mode . a beefed *****************-***************** up **4x4** ********version******** will *hit* the road in **july** .
