by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 18:55 est , 5 march 2014 @entity3 footballers have given a vote of confidence to team agents 1966 before the @entity7 in @entity8 by renewing their four - year contract until after the 2018 tournament in @entity11			1
the new deal with 1966 , who look after the players ’ interests in all the @entity17 ’s commercial deals involving the @entity3 team , was agreed by the players ’ committee of @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 without the tender process that had happened in 2010			1
on the committee : @entity3 captain @entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 four more years : @entity28 winger @entity24 ( left ) is also on the @entity3 players ' committee 1966 , run by @entity31 , @entity32 ’s former personal manager , enjoy a better relationship with the @entity17 in handling the tricky issue of players ’ personal appearances for sponsors than they have in the past			1
@entity3 have been represented by 1966 since 2006 , when music mogul @entity39 offered to work for free			2
but he has not been involved in the business since 2008			0
@entity25 , seemingly no longer part of @entity44 ’s @entity3 plans , is likely to step down from the players ’ committee after the @entity7			1
meanwhile , there has n’t been time for @entity49 to film their @entity7 advert this week , such have been the needs of @entity3 sponsors at the one squad get - together before the @entity7 party is named			2
the promised involvement of a-list players must now be fitted into a week without internationals — complicated for the @entity17 and 1966			1
deal broker : @entity32 with his former personal manager @entity31 ( right ) having his say : but @entity25 ( left ) has n't played for @entity3 for two years the @entity61 , aware that giant parachute payments distort competition in the @entity64 and put that division ’s @entity66 regulations out of kilter , held a club summit in @entity70 on wednesday to review the format ; there is another one in @entity74 on thursday			1
but it ’s unlikely any @entity61 team will vote for a reduction in parachute payments while the tv rights market remains so buoyant			0
clubs were told absent @entity61 chairman @entity80 was ill. @entity81 are set to axe the radio commentary of the @entity83 on april 6 , instead using the tv feed			1
this will save a minimal amount , while making a mockery of a radio heritage that includes @entity89 saying in 1949 : ‘ i ca n’t see who ’s ahead ; it ’s either @entity92 or @entity93			2
’ @entity94 complained in 2011 about difficulties setting up @entity97 lines at @entity98 , which is hardly the @entity99			0
a @entity81 spokeswoman could not confirm @entity83 plans on wednesday			1
moment in time : former @entity81 commentator @entity89 ( second left ) the 19 - sport @entity102 in @entity104 in 2015 , little more than a vanity project for oil - rich @entity106 , will find it that much harder to sell the event in a crowded calendar now director of communications @entity110 , the consummate pr expert who left the @entity112 after @entity113 , has chosen not to work in @entity104			2
this follows a falling - out with @entity106 ’s government , who were unhappy @entity110 put his boa commitments around medal winners ahead of a @entity104 reception in @entity113			0
@entity122 ’s name @entity102 the @entity124 initiative of a @entity125 — giving wounded armed forces members the chance to compete in a multi-sport event — is to be renamed on thursday ahead of its @entity130 launch at the @entity131 in the autumn			0
the big test will be giving the competition the razzmatazz it received in the @entity124 , where team captain @entity122 was enthused enough to announce the event should come to @entity74			0
endorsement : prince @entity122 wants to see the @entity125 come to @entity74 the @entity139 location still resembles a building site , although the velodrome , the @entity142 and the aquatic centre will all be used for the event — likely to be tagged @entity145 even if rebranded the @entity146			0
@entity148 ’s decision to host wednesdays ’s drivetime programme from a branded , glass - fronted cabin on @entity151 with tens of thousands walking past en route to the @entity3 - @entity153 game might have seemed a good idea when planned , but that was before co-presenter @entity156 was front - page news for reportedly walking out on his wife after striking up an alleged friendship with @entity161 star @entity160			2
no wonder @entity163 was wearing dark glasses in the makeshift studio			0
