when @entity1 trudged down the dressing - room tunnel at half - time , he looked like a man who was entering the sunset of a distinguished career			1
@entity7 were three goals down , their fans were numb and silent and the @entity11 hordes were gloating fit to burst			1
forty - five minutes later , with his side falling just a stride short of an extraordinary recovery , the manager ’s head was higher			0
yet he knew he had suffered a deeply damaging result			0
to make his mood still worse , he must have known that the score flattered @entity7 ; that their recovery owed more to happy chance than to an urgent search for self - respect			1
@entity1 delayed public criticism of his own team , initially offering a relatively tepid : ‘ in every single game , you have to be committed and focused from the first moment			0
’ later , his reaction was more scathing			0
from the 19th second , when their opening goal hit the net , just about everything they attempted came off triumphantly			2
festering enmity , along with a conviction that they have been consistently patronised by @entity1 down the years , means that @entity7 are the scalp they treasure above all — and they set about claiming it with killing haste			2
@entity7 ’s belated retrieval of their dignity finally foundered on the dismissal of @entity122 for a second yellow card , a poor decision which @entity1 protested			1
but since his team had been helped along their way with a harsh penalty award , they attracted scant sympathy			0
that early goal was finely executed , yet abjectly defended			0
a ball played deep down the right was worked along the line to @entity57 via the head of @entity32			2
the cross found @entity32 leaping once again , causing chaos in the @entity7 defence			1
a rebound was procured and @entity32 was left with a simple chance			2
nineteen seconds and the stadium was booming out the anthems of triumph			0
@entity7 needed swift retaliation and they should have secured it after 10 minutes when @entity83 missed a headed chance inside the six - yard box			1
but that was almost the sum total of @entity7 ’s contribution			2
they accepted their fate all too easily			0
@entity61 makes it 2 - 0 in the 35th minutes pushing his shot past @entity71 @entity61 prods in his finish after a ball from @entity63 @entity122 and the @entity7 defence are all at sea as @entity11 extend the lead provider for the second , @entity63 celebrates getting himself on the scoresheet with @entity61 on hand to join him @entity63 strikes home from @entity61 's corner to make the score 3 - 0 in a diabolical afternoon for the @entity50 mins @entity164 @entity11 total 115.9 72.0 @entity32 90 11.7 7.3 @entity63 90 11.6 7.2 @entity57 90 11.5 7.1 @entity7 total 122.4 76.0 @entity78 90 12.7 8.0 @entity82 90 11.5 7.2 @entity79 90 11.5 7.2 data courtesy of the @entity166 , the @entity167 of the @entity168 the crowd raised the noise level higher and their team responded			1
in the 35th minute , @entity11 took a second goal of blissful simplicity , with @entity63 whipping his diagonal cross to the brink of the six - yard box and @entity61 stealing in to take the decisive touch			1
@entity7 ’s shoulders , already sagging , sunk still further and genuine humiliation stared them in the face			2
they were listless beyond reason , second to every significant ball			0
for a team of elevated ambition , it was a genuinely wretched performance			0
‘ two - nil to the rugby team , ’ chorused the crowd , who have not forgotten @entity1 ’s ancient jibe			0
the @entity7 manager never left his seat			2
‘ they love me so much here , i did n’t want to give them the opportunity to show me their love , ’ he said , his sarcasm heavier than his central defenders ’ touch			0
and then , on the brink of half - time , it got even better for @entity11			1
a corner saw @entity32 winning yet another header and @entity63 zestfully belting the chance into the roof of the net			1
@entity7 raised their game in the second half , the alternative being impossible			1
@entity73 replaced @entity72 and , in the 56th minute , @entity81 struck a post , having gone past three defenders and the keeper			0
but in the 65th minute they might have gone four down when @entity61 skipped inside a non-existent challenge and drove his shot inside the post			1
‘ everyone in the ground thought that was a goal but the ref saw an offside , ’ said @entity217			0
‘ at 4 - 0 it would have been over			1
’ instead , the match went slightly mad			0
in the 68th minute , @entity7 were awarded what looked the softest penalty when @entity78 ran into the box and @entity59 was harshly adjudged to have made contact			1
@entity82 devoured the kick and @entity7 belatedly discovered the urgency they had sought			1
@entity83 scratches his head as he waits to restart with @entity82 after the third goal on the stroke of half - time @entity1 heads for the dressing room at the break with his side trailing 3 - 0 @entity61 remonstrates with officials after what he thought was his second goal was disallowed due to offside @entity82 slots the penalty as @entity7 's fight back commences two minutes later , they had a second ; a corner clearing players in the middle and @entity79 made his first emphatic contribution with a thumping volley			1
for the only time in the game , the ground fell silent , transfixed by the unthinkable			0
but then @entity74 made an innocuous challenge and @entity95 flaunted a second yellow			0
it seemed an absurdly unfair way to be sent off , but it killed the contest			0
having watched @entity32 fling arms and elbows all afternoon , @entity1 was justified in taking offence			2
there was no coming back for @entity7			2
and in truth , they deserved no better			0
@entity79 celebrates his goal that gave @entity7 a chance of running down the three - goal deficit @entity74 mistimes his challenge on @entity32 as the striker slips the ball through referee @entity95 shows @entity74 the red card in the 78th minute after his second bookable offence @entity269 here to like our @entity271 page			1
@entity60 ( left , holding @entity81 ) and @entity74 ( right , with a grip on the shorts of @entity32 ) show this was a physical encounter @entity71 looks on in disbelief as his defence let him down yet again for the third goal @entity78 faces off with @entity11 fans during the impassioned match			1

@entity32 , @entity61 and @entity63 scored in the first half as @entity11 took 3 - 0 lead
@entity32 's goal is the fastest of the @entity168 season hitting the net after just 19 seconds
@entity7 struck back through a @entity82 penalty and @entity79 's second - half volley
@entity122 got his first career red card for his second bookable offence in the 78th minute
