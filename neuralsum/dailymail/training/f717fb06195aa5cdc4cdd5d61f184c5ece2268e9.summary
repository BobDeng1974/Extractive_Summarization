@entity0 and other social networking sites can actually send you mad , according to scientists in @entity4			1
researchers from @entity6 have linked psychotic episodes in patients to internet addiction and delusions caused by virtual relationships cultivated on social networking sites			2
although all the participants had underlying problems of loneliness , none had any history of psychosis or drug abuse , the team say			1
case studies from patients in @entity4 have found that using @entity0 , and other social networking sites , can lead to psychotic episodes and delusions			1
lonely people are more likely to rely on virtual relationships and this can lead to hurt and betrayal a study from the @entity31 found that people with low income and low - educated people spend the most time on @entity0			1
and within this group , those who spent the most time on the site were less happy and less content with their lives			0
up to 85 percent of @entity0 users surveyed said they logged into the social networking site on a daily basis			1
and 26 percent of them felt ' uneasy ' if they did n't log in regularly			0
women spend an average of 81 minutes per day on @entity0			1
whereas men spend 64 minutes per day on the site			0
lead researcher doctor @entity48 of @entity6 's @entity49 and the @entity50 said : ' as internet access becomes increasingly widespread , so do related psychopathologies			0
' computer communications such as @entity0 and chat groups are an important part of this story			1
' the study took an in - depth look at three of dr @entity48 's patients			0
the studies found a direct link between psychotic episodes and their internet or @entity0 communications			1
all three of dr @entity48 's patients sought refuge from a lonely situation and found solace in intense virtual relationships			0
although these relationships were positive at first , they eventually led to feelings of hurt , betrayal , and invasion of privacy			1
dr @entity48 said : ' the patients shared some crucial characteristics , including loneliness or vulnerability due to the loss of or separation from a loved one , relative inexperience with technology , and no prior history of psychosis or substance abuse			1
' in each case , a connection was found between the gradual development and exacerbation of psychotic symptoms , including delusions , anxiety , confusion , and intensified use of computer communications			0
' the good news is that all of the patients , who willingly sought out treatment on their own , were able to make a full recovery with proper treatment and care			0
' a study in 2012 found that women spend the most time on @entity0 - 81 minutes per day - compared to 64 minutes for men			1
the poorly educated are most likely to be addicted to the site , too dr @entity48 said : ' all of the patients developed psychotic symptoms related to the situation , including delusions regarding the person behind the screen and their connection through the computer			0
' two patients began to feel vulnerable as a result of sharing private information , and one even experienced tactile hallucinations , believing that the person beyond the screen was physically touching her			1
' some of the problematic features of the internet relate to issues of geographical and spatial distortion , the absence of non-verbal cues , and the tendency to idealise the person with whom someone is communicating , becoming intimate without ever meeting face - to - face			0
' he added that mental health professionals should not overlook the internet 's influence when speaking to patients			0
' when you ask somebody about their social life , it 's very sensible to ask about @entity0 and social networking habits , as well as internet use			1
here are six basic statements			0
choose from the following scale : 1 = very rarely ; 2 = rarely ; 3 = sometimes ; 4 = often and 5 = very often			0
you spend a lot of time thinking about @entity0 or plan use of @entity0			1
you feel an urge to use @entity0 more and more			1
you use @entity0 in order to forget about personal problems			2
you have tried to cut down on the use of @entity0 without success			2
you become restless or troubled if you are prohibited from using @entity0			2
you use @entity0 so much that it has had a negative impact on your job / studies			2
if you score 4 ( often ) or 5 ( always ) on at least four of these six points , then you could be addicted to @entity0			2
' how people conduct themselves on the internet is quite important to psychiatrists , who should n't ignore this dimension of their patients ' behaviour patterns			0
' dr @entity48 said : ' our study shows that while technologies such as @entity0 have numerous advantages , some patients are harmed by these social networking sites , which can attract those who are lonely or vulnerable in their day - to - day lives or act as a platform for cyber-bullying and other predatory behaviour			2
' all of these factors can contribute to a patient 's break with reality , and the development of a psychotic state			0
' the paper was published in the @entity183			0
the authors plan to do more in - depth research on @entity0 , studying the features and applications that have the potential to harm patients emotionally or permit patients to cause emotional harm to others .			2

@entity4 scientists find @entity0 can cause ' hurt and betrayal '
none of those studied had any history of psychosis or drug abuse
one patient thought their virtual friend was reaching out of the screen and touching her
