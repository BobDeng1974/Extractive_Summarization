by @entity0 for @entity1 as a lawyer , @entity2 is very used to being in close contact with criminals			2
but the 36 - year - old from @entity7 went one step further when she took the law into her own hands - chasing a boy who had stolen her @entity12 down the street and capturing him - before holding him in a bear hug and waiting for the police			1
ms @entity2 had been taking a business call outside a coffee shop on @entity18 , @entity19 , when the 13 - year - old boy approached her , along with two others			1
lawyer @entity2 charged down the street after this 13 - year - old boy after he stole her phone , before catching him and gripping him in a bear hug until police arrived to arrest him he shoved her from behind , almost knocking her over , before wrenching her phone from her hand and making off with it			1
as soon as ms @entity2 had realised what had happened , she took action			2
dressed in wedges and a bright summer dress , she tore down the street after the thief			1
' i was all disoriented , ' she told the @entity34			0
' my headphones almost came off			0
' i looked up and i saw him running with my phone			0
' i was screaming the whole time , " get that kid ! " ' she said			0
' i finally said , " @entity41 , i 'll give you $ 200 for that			0
' ms @entity2 described the boy as ' pudgy ' , and was able to catch him even though she was wearing wedges hardly dressed for the occasion , ms @entity2 took the law into her own hands while wearing a summer dress not listening , the teenager , who ms @entity2 described as slow and out - of - shape , handed the phone to his quicker friend , but the lawyer stayed in pursuit of the original thief			1
the chase ran over five blocks before she finally caught him on @entity60 , before wrapping her arms around his chest in a bear grip and forcing him over a car - in the manner of a police offer			1
she kept him pinned down for two minutes before police arrived to handcuff him and take him to the 90th precinct station house , where he was to be charged with grand larceny			1
she had hold of him long enough for dramatic photos to be captured , in which the pair almost look to be posing			0
' he was so pudgy and was slowing down , so that ’s why i caught up to him , ' said ms @entity2 , who admitted she even felt sorry for the boy			1
despite her son being the one in the wrong , the boy 's mother was angry with ms @entity2 for catching and bear hugging him , telling @entity81 : ' she has her hands all over him			2
why is she touching him like that ? ' he ’s a very good boy , he ’s just been hanging out with the wrong crowd			0
i told him he has to stop hanging out with those boys			0
' police were able to track the phone down to a nearby apartment using @entity89 , but were unable to enter without a search warrant .			2
