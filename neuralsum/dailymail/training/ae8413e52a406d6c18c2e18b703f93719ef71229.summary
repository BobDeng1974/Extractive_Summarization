a grandmother who could n’t remember her children ’s names has had her memory fully restored thanks to a new treatment for the brain			2
@entity7 was the first person in @entity8 to receive the pioneering surgery and has now made a complete recovery			1
the 75 - year - old widow was heartbroken when two years ago she started to lose her memory and could n’t remember her own address or even the names of family members			1
@entity7 , 75 , is the first person in @entity8 to have a new memory restoration surgery at first she thought she could be suffering from dementia but as the pains in her head grew worse and her memory deteriorated , she decided to visit her gp			1
mrs @entity7 was quickly transferred to the @entity20 in @entity21 where she was told she had a vascular malformation – when a vein and artery have incorrectly joined together – affecting her brain , with potentially fatal consequences			1
but thanks to the pioneering treatment , where the vascular malformation is removed through the nose , mrs @entity7 ’s health and memory have been restored			1
the grandmother of nine from @entity34 , @entity35 , who has three daughters and a son , said : ‘ i ’d suffered for years with terrible headaches that were often so bad i could n’t lift my head from the pillow			1
‘ at times i thought my head would explode			2
the pain became so bad it affected my memory			0
i forgot who my son was , then my daughter			0
i thought i was losing my marbles or had a terrible disease			0
‘ things came to a head at a birthday party			0
the music seemed so loud so my son went to ask them to turn it down			0
when he returned i realised i ’d forgotten who he was			0
i remember saying , ‘ ‘ i know i ’m at a party with you and i know you ’ve got a sister but i ca n’t remember her name either ’ ’			2
’ after an hour the symptoms usually passed , but then kept recurring			2
mrs @entity7 recalls visiting her local shop and being unable to remember her way home			1
she was diagnosed in november 2013 , after which @entity67 surgeons tried to remove the vascular malformation using keyhole surgery , before discovering there was a danger she could have been left blind			1
‘ the doctors suggested i try a new treatment which meant going through my nose and into my brain to cut out the bits causing me problems , ’ mrs @entity7 said			1
‘ it sounded scary being the first – but i could n’t live the way i was living , so i agreed			0
’ she was referred to consultant neurosurgeon @entity81 who created the procedure where parts of the brain can be removed through the nostrils			0
he is the first surgeon in @entity8 to try it			2
a day after the six - hour operation last july mrs @entity7 was walking			1
she was home after a few days			0
dr @entity81 said : ‘ @entity7 ’s abnormality began within the nasal cavity and extended through the base of the skull into the brain			2
it made sense to approach it from the nose , a much safer route than coming from the top of the head and passing through normal brain			2
‘ it is the first time that a vascular malformation has been removed through the nose in @entity104 and in @entity8			1
the operation was possible here for the first time due to special endoscopic instruments which were donated by the @entity109			0
’ @entity7 ’s vascular malformation , called a dural artero - venous fistula , disrupted the flow of blood to and from the brain			1
this caused her extreme pain resulting in memory loss , and put her at imminent risk of a fatal brain bleed or stroke			0
the keyhole surgery doctors tried in order to make the vein and artery work properly involves tiny incisions through the skin and into the brain			1
but the malformation was so close to the optic nerve there was a danger of blindness			2
instead consultant neurosurgeon @entity81 at the @entity20 used his procedure to insert tiny endoscopic surgical instruments through the nostrils and sinus cavity to the malformation , and remove it through the nose			2
proper blood flow was restored , and the pain and memory loss rectified			0
a second patient with the same condition has now had the operation at the @entity20			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i ’ve had the most wonderful thing done for me and i ’m so grateful as i was n’t ready to die			1
i ’ve had a second chance to see my grandchildren grow up , which is the greatest gift anyone could have			0
’ she is raising money for the @entity109 ’s @entity153 , and added : ‘ i am lucky that i was fixed			0
i hope many others can benefit too			0
’ mrs @entity7 had a vascular malformation , when a vein and artery have incorrectly joined together , that affected her brain			1
an mri image above shows a functioning brain surgeons removed parts of mrs @entity7 's brain by going through her nose			1
the procedure was created by neurosurgeon @entity81			0
