meticulous preparation helped @entity1 become one of the finest referees we have seen in football			1
and he had certainly done his homework before @entity8 's @entity7 encounter with @entity9 at @entity10 in 2005			1
' i knew that at corners everything was done by @entity8 to help @entity14 head the ball , ' says the @entity16 in an interview prompted by @entity19 's campaign to put a stop to wrestling in the penalty area			1
my focus had to be around @entity14			1
' in the 76th minute of the second leg of a tense last - 16 tie , @entity8 earned what proved the all - important corner			0
the score was 4 - 4 on aggregate , with the @entity31 set to advance on the away - goals rule			0
as @entity33 delivered the ball , @entity1 had those legendary piercing eyes fixed on @entity8 's captain			1
@entity8 defender @entity14 ( left ) rises highest to score a header against @entity9 in march , 2005 @entity14 's team - mate @entity38 ( second from right ) had pushed over @entity9 keeper @entity40 @entity9 's players appealed to referee @entity1 but the @entity16 official allowed @entity14 's goal to stand ' what i saw was the opponent almost handle the ball in trying to stop @entity14 — and i saw @entity14 head the ball cleanly and the ball then finish in the net , ' he says			1
' i gave the goal and i felt confident i had achieved the correct result			2
but afterwards , when i watched the video of the game , i realised that what i had completely missed was contact between @entity38 and the @entity9 goalkeeper , @entity40			1
had i seen that , the goal would not have been given			2
but it was impossible for me to see something so far away from where i felt my focus needed to be			0
' @entity1 recalls this story to illustrate a point after agreeing to join the debate raging in the @entity66 game following a spate of high - profile incidents in the @entity69			1
led by @entity19 's @entity72 campaign , which @entity1 has been following , there is now a desire among senior @entity66 referees and members of the @entity69 hierarchy to tackle those masters of the dark arts			1
@entity1 believes extra officials can be a big help @entity1 does not wish to interfere in what he respectfully recognises as ' a domestic issue '			1
but he will discuss , in his role as @entity85 's chief refereeing officer , how the problem has been addressed by @entity89 football 's governing body			1
in @entity1 's opinion , the introduction of additional officials standing at the side of the goal has gone a long way to eradicating incidents of blocking and wrestling in the champions and @entity99			1
such cheating was something he considered a serious problem , and he was a central figure in finding a solution			2
' we introduced additional referees to the @entity107 in 2009 and the @entity7 in 2010 , and we started to see these kinds of incidents less and less , ' says @entity1			1
' incidents can still occur			0
they can still be missed because , at the end of the day , we are talking about human beings here			0
but based on our experience this in no longer a major issue in @entity85 competitions			1
' my point with that @entity8 game is the fact that , as a referee , you will know which players are most likely to commit these kinds of offences			1
so with one pair of eyes that is the area you will attempt to concentrate on			0
you will do your best			0
' but a second pair of eyes , in the form of an additional referee , gives you more control of the penalty area , which of course is where most of the important decisions in a game will be made			1
' it is n't a perfect system but it is a good system and it works in two ways			0
firstly because , of course , it is difficult for one person to see everything			0
he can focus on the most risky players but an additional referee , who communicates with the referee using a microphone , can see something more			2
' i can tell you about @entity153 , and two games he refereed — one at @entity156 and a @entity7 semi-final game between @entity158 and @entity159 last season			1
' there were two decisions that were made based on what the additional referee had seen			2
we know this because we have listened to the conversations			0
' extra officials placed behind the goals in @entity89 competition have helped stop wrestling according to @entity1 @entity1 believes an extra pair of eyes behind each goal gives the referee more control of the penalty area @entity1 explains that there is another reason why additional referees are effective in tackling the problem			1
' as a deterrent to the players , ' he says			0
' it 's like when you drive your car and you see a policeman on the side of the road			2
even if you are not speeding you instinctively slow down			0
if the players know there is another set of eyes looking for these offences , they are less likely to offend			0
' there has been a misconception that additional referees were brought in simply as an alternative to goalline technology			0
this is not the case but i 'll give you an example of where there is a crucial difference			0
' in the @entity210 final last season additional referees were used			0
at one point a @entity212 player has a header saved by the goalkeeper before the ball rebounds back off the player and crosses the line			2
' @entity219 would have said ' no goal ' in the first instance and ' goal ' in the second			2
what it would not have seen was the fact that the ball came off the @entity212 player 's hand the second time			0
the additional referee did see it and the goal was disallowed			1
@entity234 defender @entity233 ( right ) conceded a penalty against @entity236 for grabbing @entity237 @entity239 supporters get behind @entity19 's @entity72 campaign outside the @entity241 city defender @entity242 ( third from right ) got physical with @entity244 in the @entity245 ' when you had the case of mistaken identity last season involving ( @entity251 ) @entity250 and @entity252 , in @entity254 's game against @entity8 , i do not believe this would have happened had there been an additional referee			1
it is very difficult for one person in that area			0
mistakes can still be made but fewer important mistakes will be made if the officials have more control in the penalty area			1
' additional referees are now employed in domestic leagues in @entity16 , @entity268 and @entity269 , as well as the @entity7 and @entity107			2
but @entity1 says more than 30 domestic leagues now use the additional referees system in what might be considered their more important matches			2
' last season i featured in a television programme for @entity277 in @entity66 with @entity278 and @entity279 , ' adds @entity1			2
' at first they were very sceptical about the system			0
but after i showed them a series of incidents on video to illustrate where it can be useful , their opinion completely changed			0
then they felt additional referees should be used in all leagues			0
the benefit to them was clear			0
