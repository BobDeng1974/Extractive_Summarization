@entity1 fans have been urged to trust the judgement of co-chairman @entity3 over the return of @entity5 as manager			1
parish has been heavily criticised for his decision to bring @entity5 back to @entity10 following the departure of @entity12 just before the start of the season			1
but @entity16 's fellow co-chairman @entity15 is convinced the right man has been appointed and appealed to disgruntled fans to support him			1
trust him : @entity1 's co-chairman @entity15 is convinced @entity5 is the right man @entity15 told the @entity20 : ' people need to trust his [ @entity16 's ] judgement			1
he has got everything spot on so far			0
' if anyone is doubting the @entity5 appointment then just go back to the internet posters when @entity12 [ @entity27 ] got the job - it was the same then			1
@entity3 was accused of going mad			0
' @entity3 works incredibly hard for @entity1 and refuses to be rushed into anything			2
he does n't do spur of the moment			0
as soon as @entity12 left he spent all his time interviewing and taking advice from people within the game			2
' @entity3 is tough as old boots and very thick - skinned			0
he has thought long and hard who he wanted as maanger before coming to this conclusion			0
he has got the full backing of the rest of us			0
' ' thick - skinned ' : @entity15 says his co-chairman @entity3 took due care and consideration before appointing @entity5 for a second spell at @entity10 @entity12 , who guided @entity1 from a precarious position in the @entity50 relegation zone to a final position of 11th last season , was allowed to leave on the eve of the season			1
after @entity55 took caretaker charge for the opening two matches of the season , @entity16 announced the return of @entity5 on a two - year contract at the end of august			2
@entity5 was at the helm between 2007 and 2010 , guiding the @entity1 to the @entity65 play - off semi-finals in 2008 before departing for @entity66 when the club went into adminstration			2
and @entity15 insists he is the correct choice : ' he is a sensible fit			0
@entity5 is very , very experienced and is not a million miles away from @entity12 in management style and experience			2
saviour : @entity12 guided @entity1 from the @entity50 relegation zone to 11th last season but was allowed to leave the club before the start of the current campaign ' we did n’t want radical change from what we had under @entity12			1
' with the group of lads we ’ve got and the fantastic team spirit there , it was really important to have as little disruption as possible - albeit that when a manager walks out two days before the season starts it is impossible to have no disruption			0
' @entity5 is a safe pair of hands - he is not going to try and reinvent the wheel			0
' @entity1 , who drew 3 - 3 at @entity96 in @entity5 's first match , host @entity98 on saturday			1
meanwhile , midfielder @entity99 has moved to loan to @entity101 for three months			0
the 26 - year - old featured once for @entity1 this campaign , in the 3 - 0 @entity105 victory against @entity106 , but was n't selected in @entity5 's 25 - man squad for the @entity50 season .			1
