in the midst of political wrangling over budgets , deficits and debt ceilings , a new talking point has emerged on the right side of the aisle : the @entity8 , say some @entity9 , can continue to service its debt load long past oct. 17 – the date when treasury secretary @entity12 warns the @entity8 will default on its fiscal obligations – even if @entity14 refuses to raise the debt ceiling			1
the @entity16 explored the issue wednesday in an article under the headline : ' many in @entity20 : default would n’t be that bad			2
' no one has argued in favor of default , but some @entity9 have suggested that refusing to raise the debt ceiling would instead force the @entity26 to find new ways to avoid it			1
rep. @entity29 , a @entity31 @entity30 on the @entity32 , told @entity34 's @entity33 on tuesday that ' the nation will not default on its debts ' in the absence of a debt ceiling hike			1
much ado about nothing ? rep. @entity29 ( r ) is among the republicans who say the @entity8 can keep paying its debts even if @entity14 does n't raise the debt ceiling			1
but rep. @entity43 ( @entity44 ) says he has ' a distorted view of reality ' on tuesday president @entity47 slammed @entity9 whom he said do n't believe a debt default is a ' big deal , ' but he did n't parse the differences between default and a debt limit ceiling that might force fiscal discipline on the federal government ' we support the idea of the administration doing what 's within its authority to actually pay the debt , ' @entity29 said			1
' you know , the debt payments are around $ 20 billion , up and down , per month			0
income coming in , revenue coming in is around $ 230 , $ 240 billion a month			0
we want to make sure the debt is always paid			0
there 's not a single @entity30 who does not want the debt payments of this country paid			2
' @entity33 and rep. @entity43 , the @entity70 counterpoint guest opposing @entity29 , were unconvinced			0
' if they do n't raise the debt ceiling , ' @entity33 asked , ' you think the @entity8 can still go ahead and pay all its responsibilities , including making sure @entity76 checks go out on time , and all of the domestic and national security bills that come up ? ' ' actually , ' @entity29 replied , ' the answer to your question : uh , yeah			1
if you look at the revenue flow coming in , we 've prioritized this before			0
this has been looked at for years now			0
' it seems to me that you have a distorted view of reality when it comes to the debt , ' she said			1
good news ? ' if you don ¿ t raise your debt ceiling , ' said sen. @entity95 , ' all you 're saying is , " we " re going to be balancing our budget " ' the @entity16 quoted @entity99 @entity98 sen. @entity98 , who argued that government employee furloughs would free up nearly enough money to service the federal debt during the partial shutdown that began a week ago			1
' we always have enough money to pay our debt service , ' said @entity98			2
' you ’ve had the federal government out of work for close to two weeks ; that ’s about $ 24 billion a month			0
every month , you have enough saved in salaries alone that you ’re covering three - fifths , four - fifths of the total debt service , about $ 35 billion a month			0
that ’s manageable for some time			0
' @entity9 , however , have pushed for legislation that would give furloughed workers back pay when the shutdown is over			1
if @entity117 were to take up the measure and @entity47 were to sign it , those savings would vanish in the long term			2
@entity122 sen. @entity95 , the libertarian - hued @entity30 known for his controversial positions , agreed that declining to raise the debt ceiling might be a sign of fiscal responsibility			1
' if you do n’t raise your debt ceiling , ' @entity95 told the @entity16 , ' all you ’re saying is , " we ’re going to be balancing our budget			1
" so if you put it in those terms , all these scary terms of , " oh my goodness , the world ’s going to end " – if we balance the budget , the world ’s going to end ? why do n’t we spend what comes in ? " ' ' if you propose it that way , the @entity8 public will say that sounds like a pretty reasonable idea			2
' no worries : sen. @entity98 told the @entity16 that ' we always have enough money to pay our debt service ' house speaker @entity149 duels with @entity47 in successive press conferences on tuesday , saying ' there 's going to be a negotiation ' on the debt ceiling			1
the @entity154 is now hinting that a very short - term debt limit hike might be acceptable if it leads to broader budget negotiations president @entity47 said during a press conference on tuesday that defaulting on the national debt would be a catastrophic fiscal milestone in @entity8 history , but he did n't acknowledge that refusing to increase the debt ceiling might not have an immediate effect			1
' when i hear people trying to downplay the consequences of that , ' he said , ' i think that ’s really irresponsible			0
... and it ’s particularly funny coming from republicans who claim to be champions of business			0
there ’s no business person out here who thinks this would n’t be a big deal , not one			0
' ' you go to anywhere from @entity178 to @entity179 , and you ask a ceo of a company or ask a small - business person whether it ’d be a big deal if the @entity8 government is n’t paying its bills on time			2
they ’ll tell you it ’s a big deal			0
' the president will meet with members of the @entity193 on wednesday in the @entity194 of the @entity154 to discuss the political stalemate that has gripped @entity196 for weeks			1
the @entity154 says @entity47 will have similar meetings with @entity154 republicans soon			2
his bully - pulpit push also included an audience with a group of five conservative pundits and columnists on tuesday .			0

@entity30 pols claim the @entity8 can keep paying its debt obligations out of *tax* revenue , or use the money it saves by not paying furloughed workers
the @entity16 ran a *confusing* story suggesting that @entity9 do n't fear default , but they really argue that hitting the debt ceiling wo n't lead there
sen. @entity95 said refusing to raise the limit on @entity8 's credit card would force fiscal discipline on the @entity154 and @entity14
a *key* @entity220 *insists* the @entity30 has it ' a distorted view of reality when it comes to the debt '
president @entity47 will meet with the @entity193 in the @entity194 of the @entity154 on wednesday *afternoon*
