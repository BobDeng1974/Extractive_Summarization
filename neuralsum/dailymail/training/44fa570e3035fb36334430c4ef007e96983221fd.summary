@entity0 said the majority of the incidents involved @entity3 operations in international waters , and that @entity13 was the country most affected			1
mr @entity0 said @entity7 sees @entity3 's show of military strength primarily as an attempt to test @entity17 , adding that ' it does n't help to build good relations and trust			1
' it comes after a number of claims by @entity17 states of @entity3 incursions including , just yesterday , fears that a @entity3 submarine had parked up just outside @entity28 's @entity27 naval base , home of @entity31 's nuclear arsenal			1
mr @entity0 spoke in an interview with @entity33 , which said that on monday @entity35 f - 16s taking part in @entity17 's @entity37 intercepted two @entity3 @entity39 bombers			1

' the @entity3 pilot 's behaviour was not quite normal , ' said @entity53 armed forces spokesman @entity62 about the 26 - second film clip of the encounter in international airspace ' north of @entity53 '			1
' we do n't know if it was a miscalculation or if he deliberately put himself in the path of our @entity70 , ' said @entity62 , adding that @entity53 's armed forces had informed @entity3 that the incident was ' undesirable '			2
@entity53 's complaint came just a day after @entity31 said it was concerned by a sharp increase in @entity3 military flights close to its borders which it said were designed to test its air defences			1
' the extremely aggressive probing of our air space by @entity3 aircraft is an issue of concern to us , ' @entity31 foreign secretary @entity79 told a committee of lawmakers			0

' closely watched : @entity95 @entity94 jets were scrambled in october to track this @entity3 @entity97 bomber , one of two which flew close to @entity31 without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers			0
