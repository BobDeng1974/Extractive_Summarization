this is the horrifying moment a deer careered into a road and smashed into a car 's windshield as it tried to escape a pack of baying wild dogs			1
the animal hit the screen of a car being driven by @entity10 , 32 , on a highway near @entity12 in @entity13 , before bouncing off into the road			1
the animal then found its feet and ran off into the undergrowth apparently unscathed - thus escaping falling prey to the hungry pack			1
' it was over in a split second - it was a deer which had landed on the glass			2
' it smashed it completely			0
' as quickly as it was on the car bonnet it was off again			0
' it sort of bounced over the roof onto the road , found its feet and ran off into the undergrowth on the other side			1
it seemed unhurt , it was certainly able to put on a burst of speed			0
the terrified animal ran into the pathway of a car being driven by @entity10 , 32 , on a highway near @entity12 in @entity13 with no time to stop or swerve mr @entity10 had no choice but to hit the creature the impact completely shattered the windscreen of the car - but miraculously mr @entity10 , his girlfriend @entity26 , and the deer , were all unscathed			1
the animal bounded off into the undergrowth - escaping the pack of hungry animals which had been chasing it ' the wild dogs that had been all up for the hunt and were slavering at the mouth seemed to have lost interest			1
' i guess they thought they had their prey in their sights and then it was gone			0
the traffic going up and down the highway put them off the chase			0
' they sniffed the air for a bit , barked a little bit , and then turned around and headed back the way they had come			0
so if nothing else , our impromptu meeting with the deer saved it from the dogs			2
' an estimated 1,500 people across @entity13 die in accidents involving deer or moose every year			2
last week a bus collided with a moose on a busy road in neighbouring @entity95 with the creature 's antler 's smashing through the wind shield and becoming embedded in the driver 's cockpit .			0
