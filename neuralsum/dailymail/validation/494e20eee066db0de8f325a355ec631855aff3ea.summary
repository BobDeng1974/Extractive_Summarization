@entity0 's nearest and dearest knew what his reaction would be in the event of @entity5 calling			1
now 10 days into the job and confronted by his third and most difficult match , a barrage of advice from those friends and family has landed			1
two dismal draws against relegation candidates @entity16 and @entity17 , stretching the winless run to five matches , has damned the playing provision at @entity21 now operating under their third manager of a sorry season that @entity0 was hired to rescue			1
he has not been short of suggestions aimed at helping him carry out that brief picked up from @entity30			1
‘ i ’ve got family and a lot of friends who are @entity5 supporters and , if it was up to them , they would n’t have a team out there because everyone would be dropped , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if you speak to supporters , they are so frustrated and disappointed			1
@entity0 has encountered a tricky start to his spell as @entity5 manager ‘ you speak to one fan who would n’t have him in , and another who would n’t have him in , and so on			1
@entity30 tried all different permutations up front with our five strikers			1
it ’s the same with the backline and the midfield			1
‘ people have said it to me : “ i would n’t have him , him or him in the team ”			2
but that would leave us with about two players and i ca n’t flood the team with youngsters			2
my job is to get the best formula — a winning formula			2
we ’ve got time to do it and it ’s what i ’m striving to do			2
’ the emergency work on a squad ravaged by a confidence slump is required for many reasons and some can be traced back to the recruitment — on bumper contracts — of several top - flight players who have failed to live up to being @entity5 players even at a lower level			1
but @entity0 believes that a more recent explanation for the disarray in his inheritance , which includes four unfit @entity81 loan men , is that their direct competitors for promotion — and today ’s opponents @entity86 — were able to be clever in january			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , were chaotic			1
@entity86 have won their past seven games in all competitions since deadline day , reached the @entity91 semi-final and are now unbeaten in 15 matches — a streak of results that stuttering @entity5 have at no stage looked capable of stringing together			1
@entity0 joked that if his family and friends had their way that everybody would be dropped @entity0 noted : ‘ the key thing for them was the january transfer window when they managed to keep their best young player , @entity104 , while we had to sell @entity106 , who was ours			1
on top of that , they were able to add five players			2
‘ i remember saying to @entity111 at the time what a great piece of business it was to bring in @entity116 from @entity117 because he ’s a really solid @entity118 player			2
@entity116 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 have really strengthened their squad			2
‘ while they were doing that , @entity5 brought in five players from @entity81 and only one of them has been able to play a part			1
@entity111 had a clean sweep of his playing staff last summer			2
it took them time to gel but right now they have energy and confidence and they are hungry as well			2
so this will be a big challenge for us			2
’ @entity0 dug into the reserve reaches of the squad to promote the impressive 18 - year - old @entity138			1
a dozen years his elder , @entity139 completed a game for only the second time this season			2
as @entity0 seeks that winning formula , he has a frustrated and often frustrating figure offering to be an intriguing ingredient today on a return to @entity147			1
‘ i spoke to @entity139 before we picked him for the @entity17 game , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i don ’ t know why he ’s only had four starts this season			2
obviously , there are reasons and @entity139 will be a big part of that			0
but he did well the other night for a rare 90 minutes			0
‘ everyone is in the same boat — when you get an opportunity , you have to grab it			0
you ’ve got to show that you want to be out there , in training and games			0
new boss @entity0 takes charge of a @entity5 training session ‘ i know there are players here who want to be in my team			1
it ’s ok being willing and wanting to do it			0
but there ’s a big difference between that and actually producing			0
‘ next season , @entity5 need young , hungry players			1
of course , you need to balance it with experience			0
but i ’d like to have energy and vibrance in the team next season			0
’ @entity183 , having met the appearance stipulations on his contract , will be back for another season			0
he can bid to be as energetic and vibrant as @entity0 wishes but it is defensive fortitude that the boyhood @entity86 supporter will be determined to bring today to a @entity5 team that have lost their past three to the capital club			1
the 29 - year - old has filled in at right - back — rather than his favoured centre - half slot — too often this season but refuses to blame that adjustment for personal form that he admits has fallen below standard			0
‘ i ’ve been disappointed with how i ’ve played , ’ conceded @entity183			0
‘ i need to take accountability as a defender			0
rangers have limped to unconvincing draws against @entity16 and @entity17 under @entity0 ‘ we ’ve conceded too many goals			1
i ’ve played the majority of our games , so i need to say that i could have done better in certain aspects			0
‘ everyone knows that i ’m not a natural right - back			0
but i ’d rather play in that position than be in the stand			0
‘ to be fair to the previous manager and this manager , their hands have been forced a bit of the time because of injuries			1
‘ but i ca n’t keep going over old ground			0
the nine games coming up are the most important of the season			0
i ’m looking at this period as a sort of mini-league in itself			0
‘ it will be time for reflection , finger - pointing and talking about where it went wrong in the summer			0
but we have to be positive and think that , as long as we get up , in years to come that will be forgotten about			0
‘ i want my first season at @entity5 to be capped with promotion			1
i do n’t want it to be a failure , which it currently is			0
‘ to come back next season as a @entity118 player would be special			0
we all know what the fans expect and the prestige of playing for this club			0
we ’ve fallen short of that this year but , if we can get up , it will put some light on an otherwise dark season			0
