when it comes to relationships is honesty really the best policy ? some experts insist that baring all to your significant other can do wonders for improving intimacy and communication			2
but do you really want or need to know how many people the love of your life has had sex with ? in a new video from @entity16 the rather uncomfortable question is posed to couples on camera : ' do you guys know many people each other has slept with ? ' do you really need to know how many people the love of your life has had sex with ? in a new video from @entity16 couples were asked : ' do you guys know many people each other has slept with ? ' ' when i was in college , those numbers got stupid ! ' some of the men were n't afraid to share the reactions are brilliantly awkward as the couples admit that they have never asked the question , and then um and ah as they decide whether to reveal their magic numbers to each other			1
one woman nervously twists her hands as she admits : ' i think i 've been a little more on the sexually adventurous side throughout my youth , ' while another puts her fingers in her ears to stop from hearing her boyfriend 's number			0
the guys are a little more impressed with their hook - up history with one saying : ' when i was in college those numbers got stupid			0
those numbers got out of hand			0
' another reveals , laughing : ' a little over the 150 number			1
i 'm not afraid to admit anything about my past because it 's brought me to where i am today			0
' one women refused to reveal her number , only for her husband to declare : ' we might talk about this later			2
' ' we might talk about this later , ' this man was bemused by his partners refusal to reveal all ' i do n't want to think about what you did with your ex-girlfriend , ' this pair were happier not knowing			1

@entity16 asked real couples how many people they had slept with
pairs of different ages and relationship *lengths* squirmed as they answered
responses *varied* from ' 150 ' to ' we do n't have to talk about it right ? '
