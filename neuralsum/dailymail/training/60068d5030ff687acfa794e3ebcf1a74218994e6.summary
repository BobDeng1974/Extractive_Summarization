by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 ’s brilliant solo try seven minutes from full time in @entity5 on sunday allowed @entity7 ’s women to sweep away the pain of past near - misses and secure @entity11 glory at last			1
this was redemption for @entity15 ’s side			0
this was the euphoric occasion when they banished the demons of the last three finals , each one of which had ended in agonising defeat			0
this was the culmination of four years of fervent dedication , as captain @entity26 lifted the trophy which had remained stubbornly out of reach for so long			0
yet , the dream was only realised after a hefty dose of tension and drama at @entity33 , as @entity7 were pushed to the limit by a tenacious @entity36 side			2
going into the final 10 minutes , the underdogs had closed the deficit to five points , gained the upper hand in the set - piece and were swarming forward in search of the decisive score			0
they were making basic errors which they had not done in the semi-final demolition of @entity63 and were lacking any real fluency in their attacking game as their opponents competed strongly at the breakdown and in defence			2
the @entity71 line - up were within touching distance of their destiny but they needed a moment of inspiration to guard against a last - gasp upset			0
in the 73rd minute , @entity7 were awarded a penalty and kicked to touch on the right			2
when the ball was won at the lineout , the @entity84 centre ’s powerful burst took her through two tackles into the @entity36 22 and she carved a superb diagonal line to go clear and over for the crucial try			0
after being mobbed by jubilant team - mates , the 24 - year - old then knocked over the conversion to add to her earlier three penalties , to complete a 16 - point personal haul			0
lining up : final hero @entity56 of @entity7 prepares to kick as @entity7 overcame @entity36 dejected : the @entity36 team stand back as @entity7 receive the @entity11 soon afterwards , despite one last red wave of defiance , the @entity98 celebrations began in earnest			1
@entity26 broke away from the pandemonium to acclaim @entity56 , saying : ‘ she is phenomenal			2
she is a world - class player and she showed that today on a world - class stage			0
’ the skipper added : ‘ it is 20 years since @entity7 last won the @entity11 so it is amazing that we have done it			1
@entity36 were fantastic but our group of girls and all the staff deserved this			0
we have had a rough ride			0
' this was the last game many of the @entity7 players will play for their country and @entity26 heralded their contribution , saying : ‘ we are going to lose massive figures like @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			1
they have done a great job for @entity98 rugby and deserved to go out on a high			0
‘ so many legends who have gone before us have n’t won a @entity11 in an @entity7 shirt and that was for all of them who were here today and for all of the @entity7 rugby family			1
’ top performance : @entity56 of @entity7 dives to touch down a try late on @entity120 emphatically lived up to her nickname of ‘ @entity135 ’ with a prodigious display of tackling , breakdown work and tireless harrying of the opposition , while @entity140 also stood tall once again in the back row			1
further back , @entity142 was a livewire running threat and @entity56 contributed top - class poaching to go with her goalkicking and wonderful late try			1
in a first half awash with adventurous intent on both sides , @entity7 had surged clear with a classy opening try in the 33rd minute			2
after @entity56 and @entity153 combined at pace down the left , a clever show - and - go by second row @entity152 created space for @entity120 to send full back @entity158 hurtling into the right corner			1
at 11 - 0 , @entity161 ’s team had a strong grip , but @entity164 ’s three penalties and @entity36 ferocity typified by openside @entity166 kept the game in the balance until @entity56 ’s strike settled it			1
@entity7 had suffered too much in past finals and gone through too much in the last four years to let this one slip			2
across the channel : travelling @entity7 fans celebrate the victory on the final whistle piling through : @entity36 's centre @entity177 tackles @entity7 's scrum - half @entity142			1

@entity158 and @entity56 tries seal win for @entity7 in @entity5
@entity7 won the *tournament* in 1994 with a win over @entity*18*5
@entity63 lose third place play - off *25* - *18* to @entity*18*8
