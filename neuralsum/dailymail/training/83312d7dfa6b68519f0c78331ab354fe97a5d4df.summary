by @entity0 a businessman who destroyed his 40 - year marriage by ‘ putting to death ’ his wife ’s pet ram has been ordered to pay her £ 170,000 a year in maintenance			1
the globe - trotting couple – whose property portfolio includes a £ 15million home in @entity12 , north @entity13 – enjoyed a life of luxury until the pet was slaughtered at one of their homes in the south of @entity21			0
mr @entity22 said the ram ’s death last year followed an ‘ animated argument ’ between the husband , 68 , and his 70 - year - old wife and it was ‘ perhaps unsurprising that the relationship irretrievably collapsed at that point ’			1
put to death : the husband caused a ' very animated ' row by killing her wife 's pet ram , a high court judge said the mother of two issued a divorce petition in @entity13 , insisting her ‘ completely anglicised ’ husband had made his home in the @entity39 , although he had for years insisted to the tax authorities that he had ‘ non-dom ’ status			1
the husband , whose main interests are said to be shooting and fine wine , had spent over 110 days in @entity47 in the past 12 months – more than anywhere else in the world – and the wife therefore had an ‘ arguable case ’ he was domiciled here , the judge ruled			0
the wife had claimed more than £ 390,000 in annual maintenance to tide her over , including £ 24,000 for ‘ clothes and footwear ’			2
however , mr @entity22 trimmed this down to £ 170,000 a year			1
the case will return to court when a judge will decide if the @entity47 courts have jurisdiction to hear the wife ’s divorce petition			0
details of the couple 's disputes emerged after a private hearing in the @entity69 of the @entity69 in @entity13			0
mr @entity71 said : ' after over 40 years of marriage , relations between the parties in 2011 soured and , in that year , according to the wife , the husband asked for a separation , ' said mr @entity22 in a written ruling on a preliminary dispute about maintenance			1
ruling : the case was heard in the family division of the @entity69 , which sits in the @entity82 in @entity13 , pictured row : the dispute took place in the @entity85			1
pictured is @entity88 harbour ( file photo ) ' in june 2013 , relations between the parties irretrievably broke down , when the parties had a most animated argument in the south of @entity21 , in circumstances where the husband had put to death the wife ’s pet ram			0
' mr @entity22 said the woman applied for maintenance , pending a trial of the couple ’s claims over money , at a hearing in march			2
£ 170,000 rent in @entity13 £ 70,000 holidays and flgiths £ 24,000 clothes and shoes £ 18,000 restaurants £ 7,000 health insurance £ 6,000 lease on a car the woman ’s ' budget ' included £ 18,000 a year for restaurants , £ 70,000 for holidays and @entity120 flights , and £ 24,000 for clothes and footwear			1
the man said her claims , which totalled £ 393,000 a year , were ' too high '			2
mr @entity22 said he had concluded that she should be paid around £ 14,166 a month - about £ 170,000 a year - in maintenance			1
her revised budget included £ 12,000 for clothes and shoes , £ 50,000 for flights and holidays and £ 10,000 for restaurants			0
mr @entity22 added that there was no suggestion the man would struggle to pay the huge sums for his wife 's upkeep			1
his judgment also dealt with the issue of ' divorce tourism ' raised by the fact that the man and woman are filing for divorce in separate countries in an apparent bid to get a better settlement			0
mr @entity22 said : ' it is perfectly obvious what the motives of the parties were in issuing proceedings respectively in @entity47 and @entity154			2
' the wife obviously believes that she will be afforded more generous treatment by this court than in the court of her homeland			0
the husband believes that he will be afforded more conservative and , therefore to him , more generous treatment in the court of his wife 's homeland			2
' however he added that under @entity120 law there is nothing to stop claimants ' shopping ' for a better deal , and that to an extent the practice is ' encouraged ' by the lack of clauses to stop it			0
the case is due to continue at a further hearing in december .			0
