by @entity0 as any woman with a generous bosom will tell you , there are certain items of clothing you do n’t even bother trying on			1
for large busted women like @entity9 , a bra can make or break an outfit strapless dresses are definitely in the no - go camp			1
on the hanger they might promise summer glamour , but on anyone over a d - cup they ’d almost certainly end up making the bust look saggy and wobbly , instead of pert and firm			2
the key issue is getting the right support			1
and this is where better - endowed women have been let down — because , until recently , strapless bras just have n’t been up to the task			1
certainly , as a girl with an @entity30 , the few times i ’ve braved a strapless bra it ’s been an unmitigated disaster			1
by far the worst embarrassment was at a ball as a top - heavy teen			2
the pesky thing offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless prom dress as i bopped away			1
when it made it to my stomach , i was forced to sidle off to the loos , whip it off and abandon it			2
when you are wearing something so big it resembles @entity49 ’ flying helmet , there ’s no way it ’s going to fit in your tiny evening bag			1
my only experience as a bridesmaid was just as torturous			2
the beautiful mauve dress had a bustier top and this time i chose a strapless contraption that was so tight , my décolletage was flattened completely			1
i walked down the aisle cursing my unsightly mono boob			2
ever since , i ’ve avoided dresses that require secret scaffolding			2
the pesky thing offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless prom dress			1
when it made it to my stomach , i was forced to abandon it but finally there might be hope for women like me			2
this summer , several new strapless bras have been launched in bigger cup sizes to rescue us busty ladies			1
@entity79 , buyer for upmarket lingerie retailer @entity81 , says fit is vital			1
‘ the many common mistakes women make when purchasing a bra are all the more obvious when wearing a strapless garment , ’ she says			1
‘ most incorrectly - fitted women rely on the bra straps for support , but the majority of support in a bra should come from the back band , which should be a firm fit to the body			1
’ @entity97 explains this may mean going down a back size to ensure a snugger fit			1
the underwire , meanwhile , should sit just beneath the bust rather than on the rib cage , without pressing on any breast tissue			2
the right size cup will encase the breasts at the side and sit flatly against the chest at the front			2
with her advice in mind i put the best of the @entity116 strapless bras to the test , rating each one for fit and staying power — and how well they performed when it came to the all - important issue of sagging			1
it sits quite low on the chest , but pushes the boobs up well for just the right amount of cleavage			2
firm hold thanks to the underwiring , moulded cups and silicone strips on the back band			0
to start with my breasts escaped from the cups , but once i ’d got the positioning right , it gave great lift and shape			0
fit : 4.5/5 staying power : 5/5 @entity149 factor : low @entity151 £ 44 , harrods.com i needed help to do this up ; it has three hooks at the back and the underwiring is very stiff			1
it sat lower than some beneath my boobs , so pressed on my ribs a little			0
the cups were intended to envelop the entire breast , but i was still spilling out a little at the top			0
a good hold and a smooth line , but not the best lift			0
fit : 3.5/5 staying power : 4/5 @entity149 factor : low to medium all - around @entity173 £ 59 , spanx.com a comfier alternative to an underwire , though you have to be a contortionist to get it on			1
comes in four sizes , small to @entity180 , and claims to offer support , a sleek fit and to trim the torso			1
unfortunately the stretchy fabric pressed down on my breasts instead of lifting them , giving them a bit of a ski slope			0
although it was comfy , it did n’t give enough support or pertness			0
fit : 3.5/5 staying power : 3/5 @entity149 factor : medium @entity195 £ 22.50 , marksandspencer.com the longer line gives this bra a glamorous look without creating too much wobbly cleavage			1
it has four hooks at the back , so i needed help to get into it , but it felt secure , held well and is available up to an e cup in three colours – black , white and a sugary pink			0
my only gripe was that the underwire comes up slightly too high at the side so it pressed a little on my breast tissue there			0
some va va voom and lift without looking tarty			0
fit : 4.5/5 staying power : 5/5 @entity149 factor : low @entity219 £ 16 , @entity220 well			1
what can i say ? my cups overfloweth … in this bra , which does up at the side and has a clear back strap so it can be worn under backless dresses , i had cleavage to rival @entity229 ’s and although my husband liked it , i felt terribly exposed			0
when i put on the dress , the top of my breasts got squashed giving me that dreaded ‘ double boob ’ look			0
the clear strap , meanwhile , looked like @entity240			0
the bra generally felt too loose and started to slip down after a while			0
it only goes up to a @entity244 — clearly not big enough to contain us busty girls			1
fit : 3/5 staying power : 3/5 @entity149 factor : medium @entity251 £ 35 , ultimo.co.uk if it ’s sexy cleavage you ’re after , then this bra is for you			1
there was so much lift , i could n’t see my shoes			0
the moulded design has optional gel pads that slip into the cup to boost your bust even further , but on me this caused side overspill			0
the downside is it only goes up to a @entity244			0
this just about fitted me but there are other strapless styles catering up to a g cup			1
would be great under a halterneck low - back dress if you want to show off your biggest assets but while it did lift and separate excellently and gave a firm hold , the barmaid look is not for me			0
fit : 4/5 staying power : 4.5/5 @entity149 factor : low @entity283 by @entity284 , £ 81.95 , rigbyandpeller.com this bra gives a lovely rounded shape and a reasonable lift that feels age appropriate			1
as a mother of three , these days , i do n’t want to spill out over the top like @entity292			0
it ’s very comfortable and feels secure under the dress			0
available in sizes up to a @entity124 cup in three colours ( black , nude and white ) this bra can be worn with straps , too , so it ’s versatile			0
the downside is that it ’s pricey , but the great fit makes it a worthwhile summer investment			2
fit : 5/5 staying power : 5/5 @entity149 factor : low fashion forms @entity310 bra , £ 28 , @entity312 this self - adhesive bra is available up to a @entity244 cup , which surely defies gravity			2
the first time i tried , the bra was n’t straight so i had to peel myself out and reposition			0
there was some lift but the cups gaped and the side wings started to unstick			0
i feared that @entity324 scene when @entity326 ’s bra pings off			0
would be less perilous for the smaller busted , not one for the well - endowed			0
fit : 2/5 staying power : 2/5 @entity149 factor : medium			2
