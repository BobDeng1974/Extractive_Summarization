@entity5 secretly inhaled @entity6 , while working at @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , and returned to her duties ' staggering ' and ' slurring her speech as though she was groggy ' , the @entity4 was told she could not be found on the antenatal ward and the whole maternity unit went searching for the missing midwife for up to an hour			1
@entity5 eventually returned groggy and told colleagues she ‘ did not know where she had been ' , before claiming she had been in the toilets for the duration			1
she was later found in a maternity room with a tube in her mouth , sucking the gas , before she spread her arms and fell onto the bed			2
a colleague then got into a tussle with @entity5 as she refused to release the tube , before begging the colleague not to tell anybody about the incident			2
@entity5 went missing again a month later			1
a colleague phoned @entity5 to ask where she was and she replied that she did not know			2
three empty bottles of the gas were later found in @entity5 ’s car prompting an @entity4 investigation			1

‘ it determined that her actions constituted misconduct , in that they fell far short of the standards of conduct expected in the circumstances and those within the remit of the code			0
’ mr @entity45 added : ‘ the panel accepted that mrs @entity5 had developed significant insight into her misconduct			0
‘ this , together with the genuine expression of regret and remorse , and the reflection she has shown , satisfied the panel that she had demonstrated a good understanding the impact her actions could have had on patients and the reputation of the profession			0
‘ the panel noted that mrs @entity5 appeared to be an otherwise capable midwife and was provided with satisfactory references attesting to there being no other concerns regarding her practice			0
‘ nevertheless , the panel acknowledges that mrs @entity5 is currently unable to provide evidence that the circumstances leading to her misconduct have been fully remediated			0
