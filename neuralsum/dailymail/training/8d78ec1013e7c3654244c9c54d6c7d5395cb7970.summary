by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 27 july 2012 first , runner @entity1 charmed the world with his infectious smile and classic good looks			2
then , there was the ridiculously photogenic puppy , a galloping lop - eared creature frolicking through a meadow that became an instant internet sensation			2
but now there 's @entity11 , an exterminator working out of @entity12 , @entity13 , who also happens to know how to work his angles			1
@entity15 : here , he holds a family of opossums , looking dashing tiny friend : a small opossum rests on his shoulder blue steel : sporting a clean - shaven face , @entity11 shows off a gator with the poise of a pro on his website , @entity27 , which operates out of @entity12 , @entity13 , mr @entity11 posted dozens of pictures of himself in action – with every kind of critter that central @entity13 could produce			1
mr @entity11 spoke with @entity33 about the honour of being named @entity36 ’s ‘ sexiest exterminator			1
‘ i would n’t say it ’s necessarily accurate , ’ he said , laughing , ‘ but i ’ll take what i can get			2
’ his business , he explained , is all about handling wildlife humanely , he explained , and not so much about exterminating pests			1
‘ it ’s me and two guys in @entity12 , both better looking than me , ’ he said			1
among the dangerous things he ’s caught are alligators , rattlesnakes , armadillos and other more common creatures like raccoons , bats , and rats			2
double trouble : here , he poses with two young raccoons , flashing a toothy smile going batty : it is clear that the wildlife lover does not fear any of the animals with which he deals he explained : ‘ the only animals that are killed are rats			1
they ’re good animals , they ’re intelligent , i do n’t want to kill any rats , but there ’s no other practical way to ( get rid of them )			1
’ the rest of the animals are taken out to the wild and re-released			1
‘ the worst thing you can do is poison rats			0
that would cause them to suffer needlessly			0
the most important thing is to seal up the home to make sure the rats ca n’t get inside			0
’ other photographs show that the trapper is anything but squeamish			0
one image shows him holding a pair of dead rats trapped in @entity85 mousetraps			0
the images were spotted by @entity36 ’s @entity87 , who said she might have been in need of someone to take care of a pest problem			0
tame and dangerous : left , he holds a harmless ringneck snake in a house , and right , holding a boa constrictor steely gaze : @entity97 in @entity12 , @entity13 is the dreamiest exterminator ever smoldering : @entity11 posts pictures on @entity27 's website showing off the critters he catches mr @entity11 said that the photos ended up on his website in part because he was training so many other people , and partially because he wanted to provide information for those dealing with the local fauna			1
the nuisance wildlife operator offered some professional advice , as well			1
a word to the wise ? ‘ never try to handle wildlife – leave it alone , particularly snakes			2
if anyone does have a wildlife problem , hire the right person , and no one who uses poison , because it ’s inhumane and does n’t solve the problem			2
’ he said he married a wonderful woman this january			0
his wife , he said , loves baby raccoons ' the best			0
' he added : ' baby raccoons are way cuter than me of course			0
they 're even cuter than my wife , but i wo n't tell her that			0
' ridiculously photogenic : this picture of @entity1 , pictured in the maroon shirt , became an instant internet meme canine companion : this picture of a loping puppy was the next meme in line - the pooch was dubbed the most ' ridiculously photogenic dog '			0

@entity11 , a nuisance wildlife operator , works out of @entity12
has taken pictures with animals before *relocating* them into the wild
