@entity0 have denied that their worst ever @entity1 has been the result of them being tied up in knots by an obsession with statistics and analysis			1
the lack of freedom in their batting and their apparent reluctant to think on their feet while bowling has been the biggest problem for @entity0 in a @entity1 where they have failed to live up to even the most modest of expectations			1
and @entity17 appeared to sum up their whole constipated approach when he said in the aftermath of @entity0 ’s humiliating defeat by @entity22 that he would have to ‘ look at the data ’ to see what went wrong			1
@entity26 speaks to the assembled media ahead of @entity0 's dead rubber against @entity29 on friday @entity30 is pictured arriving at @entity31 following @entity0 's embarrassing defeat against @entity22 @entity33 reacts after he loses his wicket en route to a humiliating defeat against @entity22 yet @entity26 , the man who led @entity37 to the @entity38 and the @entity40 titles last year before throwing in his lot with @entity0 , says that whatever has led to @entity0 ’s shortcomings here , it is not statistics			1
‘ there has been a lot said about stats and team meetings , ’ said assistant coach @entity26			1
‘ but when i was with @entity37 we had a lot more meetings and looked at stats a lot more than @entity0 do			1
there ’s no question about that			2
‘ we had a team of six people working with @entity37 during the @entity40 who provided us with data straight after a game and the next day			1
our preparation from fantastic statistics helped us win the final			1
’ it is @entity67 who is accused of being driven by the numbers			2
‘ it ’s tough on him but he accepts the criticism and knows it comes with the territory , ’ said @entity26			1
‘ it ’s unfair that @entity17 is the one in the spotlight			2
we ’re all in this together and we ’re all responsible for what has happened			0
’ the theory that @entity0 have been stifled by outdated plans has been given credence by the fact that captain @entity82 , who was expected to be a free spirit here , has repeatedly brought up statistics in press conferences			1
‘ i ca n’t answer for them			0
i ca n’t say why they said that , ’ said @entity26 of @entity17 and @entity82			1
‘ all i know is we ’re not spending hours talking about statistics and numbers			2
we do n’t do that			0
@entity22 celebrate their shock victory over @entity0 in the @entity1 earlier this week @entity82 was expected to be a free spirit at the @entity1 but has been bogged down by statistics ‘ what we do is allow people to look at footage			1
everybody has analysis of the opposition downloaded onto their @entity102 and it ’s up to them if they want to look at it or not			0
there are lots of different ways that people like to learn			0
‘ for instance , @entity30 is someone who is very well planned and methodical			0
he wants to know how many net bowlers we have , whether there ’s a left - arm seamer , how many right - handers there are			0
and he probably studies the footage in detail			0
but @entity124 will come up to me and say ‘ listen @entity125 , i ’m not interested in what ’s on my @entity102 , i just want to go and bat			0
and he has had praise for his approach			2
you have to cater for everybody			0
’ @entity26 has created an excellent impression around the @entity0 team amid the wreckage of this tour and , with his experience of leading @entity37 to limited - overs success , it would not be a surprise if he takes greater responsibility for the ‘ new era ’ of one - day cricket they have to produce			1
‘ there will be a lot of discussion and debate about how we move forward and what the next step is , ’ said @entity26			2
‘ we have the @entity145 series where there will be a few changes and @entity148 and others will come back			0
‘ we made good progress in test cricket with the @entity154 series last year and we have to keep building on that			0
one - day cricket is a completely different story and we have to make sure that by the time we play @entity158 in 50 - over cricket this summer we have clear direction			0
‘ there ’s a fantastic opportunity now for players in county cricket to stick their hands up and say ‘ there are spaces in that @entity0 team and i ’m going to take my chance ’			2
there has never been a better time for people to do that to be honest			0
