according to some accounts , the wealth of the ancient roman empire was reflected in the very fabric of the city - with buildings of sparkling white marble at its centre			1
even the founder of the @entity1 , @entity8 claimed that he had ' found @entity10 a city of bricks and left it a city of marble '			1
but new research by historians at the @entity18 has now cast doubt on this boast			2
scroll down to explore ancient @entity10 in 3d this reconstruction by historians at the @entity18 shows how @entity10 would have looked under the rule of @entity8 and reveals that many of the buildings were made from brick ( shown in grey ) while only a few temples were constructed from marble ( pink ) using architectural computer modelling software they have been able to reconstruct the entire city to reveal how it would have looked during the rule of @entity8 between @entity35 and @entity36			1
the @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 have remained standing for nearly 2,000 years			0
scientists claim to have found a ' secret ' ingredient in @entity1 concrete that helped it endure the elements			0
using x ray beams at the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , researchers were able to study a reproduction of @entity1 volcanic ash - lime mortar			0
in the concrete walls of @entity38 , constructed around 110 ce , this mortar binds cobble - sized fragments of tuff and brick			0
scientists looked at the mineralogical changes that took place in the curing of the mortar over a period of 180 days and compared the results to 1,900 year old samples of the original			0
the team discovered that the volcanic ash creates a crystal structure that prevents tiny cracks from spreading			0
they also found that the use of strätlingite crystals in the material showed no corrosion , with their smooth surface suggesting stability			0
they found that in fact only a small proportion of the buildings in @entity10 at the time were converted from brick into marble			1
indeed , the few buildings that were built from marble were hidden from view within the city landscape , meaning many historical discriptions of the city 's beauty were perhaps exaggerated			1
their discovery suggests that the claim attributed to @entity8 may have been more of a metaphor than a literal boast			2
dr @entity94 , who led the work , said : ' many scholars have looked at @entity8 ’ claim from a political standpoint , as a metaphor for him transforming a republic into an empire			2
' i wanted to see if @entity10 literally transformed under his rule			2
given the literary descriptions and artwork , i thought these glittering marble temples on high would be very visible , but they were not			0
' dr @entity94 used information from archaeological and historical records to produce the computer model that can show how the city evolved during @entity8 ' rule			1
buildings constructed from marble were shaded with pink while those that were made from brick were shaded brown			1
those under construction were yellow			0
when the researchers examined the model , they found just a few buildings were clad with marble , including the @entity128 of @entity129 and the @entity130			1
dr @entity94 found that when viewed from the street level , however , these buildings were not widely visible			0
shortly before @entity8 came to power , the @entity134 marble quarries on the northwest coast of @entity136 were opened , and this was thought to have made marble a popular building material			1
@entity8 commissioned several large marble structures , some of which took 40 years to complete			2
as a result , massive marble blocks were constantly being moved through the city , causing congestion in the streets			0
marble - paved public spaces , which used to only be found in sacred temples and houses of the elite , were also added throughout the city			1
the 3d model ( above ) allows researchers to explore the city down to the street level and see how it changed between @entity35 and @entity36 the @entity130 in the @entity159 was one of the few buildings to be constructed from marble in @entity10 under @entity8 dr @entity94 said this may be why @entity10 earned its reputation as a city of marble			1
she said : ' because they saw construction taking place constantly , i believe people really did think that @entity10 had been transformed into marble			2
' but in reality , the city did not greatly transform			0
' many artworks , like the painting above , and historical accounts depict @entity10 under @entity8 as being dominated by marble buildings			1

emperor @entity8 boasted about how his rule left @entity10 ' a city of marble ' while historical accounts said it glittered
historians at the @entity18 have reconstructed ancient @entity10 using architectural software
they found that most of the buildings were built mainly from brick and only a few temples were made from marble
those that were made from marble would have been *difficult* to see from many parts of the city , say the researchers
