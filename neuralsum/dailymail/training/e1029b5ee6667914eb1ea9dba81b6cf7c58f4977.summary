a dying mother who has been told she has just 18 months to live would have been saved if she started getting cancer treatment five months earlier , a court heard			1
@entity3 , now 35 , is suing the @entity4 for £ 750,000 , claiming surgeons ignored official guidelines and refused her treatment because she was too young			1
the mother - of - two , who has terminal breast cancer , told the @entity10 in @entity11 that she was forced to wait five and half months before being seen by a specialist			1
she has now been told by doctors that she has only less than two years to live , robbing her of the chance to see her children grow up			2
consultant surgeon @entity25 said : ' my opinion is that she would have been cured of the cancer on the balance of probabilities			0
' looking at the results of 20,000 women of a similar age , we find 90 % of those women are cured of the disease if treated at the earliest opportunity			0
' but a breast cancer surgeon , for the defence , said ms @entity3 's cancer was so aggressive that it would not have responded to treatment			1
ms @entity3 is now suffering from terminal breast canceras and has been told by doctors that she has only 18 months to live @entity45 , a professor of surgical oncology , said : ' the fact she relapsed despite all the surgery and most high - tech therapy available shows she is in the small percentage who would have died			1
' he added : ' if the key does n't fit the lock then the door wo n't open and the patient is n't cured			0
it 's black and white			0
' professor @entity45 also told the court ms @entity3 could have lessened her chances of survival because she took the pill during treatment			1
he said that taking the contraceptive pill could have affected her body 's ability to fight against tumours and risk complications in surgery			1
' if i saw somebody on the pill i would ask them to stop it because it increases the risk of blood clots at surgery			2
i 'd ask them to stop it for that reason alone , ' he said			0
' if i stopped the pill then by the time that person came for surgery the tumour would have stopped growing			0
' ms @entity3 was 31 when she went to her gp after noticing a lump in her breast in july 2010			1
he sent an ' urgent referral ' to @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , but surgeon @entity17 downgraded her to ' routine ' and classed the case as not urgent because she was under 35			0
ms @entity3 finally had chemotherapy in 2011 and was cancer - free for several years until a lump appeared in her neck in april this year			1
she was told by doctors the cancer had spread to her bones and she had only 18 months to live			1
a renowned cancer expert told the hearing @entity4 surgeons at the @entity87 ( pictured ) missed the chance to save ms @entity3 ' by a mile ' a renowned cancer expert later told the hearing @entity4 surgeons missed the chance to save ms @entity3 ' by a mile '			1
research has found that the pill is found to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer , particularly in younger women			1
this risk only returns back to normal after ten years of stopping its use			0
it may also increase the risk of developing cervical cancer			2
but the combined pill is found to actually lower the risk of certain other cancers such as ovarian , womb and bowel cancer			2
professor @entity122 , who has published more than 500 papers on the disease , branded claims she would not have been cured if she had received treatment earlier as ' ridiculous and preposterous '			0
prof @entity122 said a crucial ' window of opportunity ' to treat ms @entity3 was ' missed by a mile '			1
he strongly rejected claims that ms @entity3 would not have survived treatment because her cancer was so aggressive			1
he said : ' @entity3 is not a chemotherapy resistant individual and you can just look at her to know that			0
' with women we know you have to act more quickly because the breast cancer is a lot more aggressive			2
' to say that @entity3 would have died on the same day is just ridiculous - it 's just the most preposterous thing i 've heard in a semi-academic forum			2
' prof @entity122 , who sees up to 30 cancer patients a day , added : ' this cancer was allowed to grow for a great many months			0
when you have a young woman with a lump in her breast you have a window of opportunity and that was missed by a mile here			0
' as far as i can tell ' common sense does n't matter , she was going to die anyway so why bother treating her in the first place ? ' is what i heard a lot of this morning			0
' ms @entity3 , of @entity160 , @entity89 , is due to marry her partner next month			2
her children @entity163 , 14 , and @entity164 , 10 , will be by her side at the service			0

@entity3 says treatment was delayed because she was under 35
she has terminal breast cancer and been told she has 18 months to live
cancer experts said she would have survived if not for treatment delay
@entity10 heard being on contraceptive pill also put her at higher risk
experts said pill can reduce the body 's ability to fight tumours
ms @entity3 is now suing for £ 750,000 *compensation*
