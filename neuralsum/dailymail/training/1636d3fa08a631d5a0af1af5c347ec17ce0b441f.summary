by @entity0 published : 21:25 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 06:17 est , 26 september 2012 if the drudgery of the daily commute has lost its charm , businessman @entity1 may have the high - octane antidote			1
he 's started doing his treks to the office on an amazing water - powered jet pack that appears to owe more to the technology of @entity10 and @entity11 than the @entity13 omnibus			1
instead of getting the car out of the garage or heading to the bus stop , he straps on the device , which uses water pressure to lift him up to 30ft in the air and propel him along horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph			1
scroll down for demo ! ... to infinity and @entity24 ! @entity1 shows off his 007 - style jet pack which he uses to commute to work water way to travel : the jet pack can lift mr @entity1 up to 30ft in the air and propel him horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph he says the 40 - mile journey from his riverside boathouse home in @entity34 near @entity35 to his office at the @entity37 in the @entity38 is possible because the @entity39 and waterways run direct between the two			1
though he does have to walk the last three minutes to his office			0
mr @entity1 , 51 , has also been asked to be the @entity43 's ' test pilot ' and to compile a ' pilot user guide ' for other would - be customers			1
but the fun comes at a price			0
the jet pack , which is imported from @entity49 where it is made under license from @entity52 company @entity51 , will set you back a cool £ 115,000 – enough to buy an @entity54 for 007 and still have change for a few gadgets			2
who needs the car : the 51 - year - old uses the device to travel from his riverside boathouse home in @entity34 near @entity35 to his office at the @entity37 in the @entity38 a practical plaything : depending on the pilot 's weight , a @entity64 can top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling , with a range of around 80 miles the jet pack is not a rocket			1
instead it operates on the same principle as a giant pump by generating huge amounts of water pressure to provide a thrust similar to that of a fireman ’s hose			2
mr @entity1 , whose business interests include the @entity37 in @entity84 , an upmarket 600 - acre waterside community of eco-friendly luxury second - homes in the @entity38 , said : ' i ’m the first person in @entity43 to buy one			1
i just like alternative means of transport			0
' it ’s a different way to commute			2
it ’s better than sitting in a traffic jam or being stuck on a crowded train			1
it ’s environmentally - friendly			1
' it ’s fantastic fun and it ’s not complicated to operate			2
i often commute to @entity100 by train and sometimes take my boat to the station			2
i have a pilot ’s licence and fly planes and helicopters			2
why not this ? ’ 00 - heaven : the jet pack , designed by @entity112 - born @entity111 @entity110 , was inspired by the one used by @entity10 in the opening scenes of the 1965 film @entity114 ( right ) a @entity115 : the jet pack is not too dissimilar to the backpack used by @entity11 ( right ) the jet pack comprises a number of key parts			1
first , there is the pack itself which resembles the one used by @entity10 in @entity114 or by @entity11 in the movie @entity115			1
this is connected to a 33ft hose which in turn is connected to a boat - like flotation device , inside which is a 250cc four - stroke petrol motor			1
the ' boat ' is the pump generator and sits in the water sucking up vast quantities of water which are then forced through the hose and into the jet nozzles on a special lightweight carbon - fibre frame weighing 30lbs strapped to the pilot ’s back			1
the sheer force of this jet lifts the pilot off the ground or out of the water			0
he or she then controls the speed by a motor - cycle - style twist - grip on one of the handles			2
direction is just like flying and depends on the pilot shifting his or her weight			0
the maximum altitude is limited by the length of the tube , which also limits the distance from water a pilot can travel			0
a digital fly - by - wire system is used to control the throttle which the makers say make flight controls simple , light and intuitive			1
mr @entity1 added : ' it ’s entirely buoyant so it wo n’t sink			1
you can go 30ft high or hover over the water – even walk on the water			2
' if you want to go right you put down your right hand you can do tight turns			0
after a few goes , you get the hang of it it ’s like riding a bicycle			0
you have a " kill switch " around your wrist to cut the power			0
' inspired by the jet pack used in the opening scenes of @entity114 , the @entity182 is the brainchild of @entity110 , a @entity112 - born @entity111 who first sketched out his concept on a yellow @entity188 in 2000 and spent the next 10 years developing it			1
the makers say that , depending on pilot weight , a standard @entity64 could top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling with a range of around 80 miles			0
it can accommodate pilots of 1.5metres to 2metres in height and between 40kg and 150kg in weight			0
mr @entity1 is himself a keen flyer who has his own aeroplane and helicopter			1
earlier this month , he abseiled down @entity100 ’s new shard skyscraper with the @entity206 in aid of charity			0
the makers say basic skills can be mastered in just 15 minutes though intermediate skills will take between one and 10 hours			0
@entity212 : mr @entity1 has been asked to be the @entity43 's ' test pilot ' and to compile a pilot user guide for other would - be customers @entity216 : £ 115,000 maximum altitude : 30ft top speed : circa 30mph cruising duration : 2 to 3 hours range : around 80 miles weight of jet - pack harness : 30lbs jetpack height : 3ft 2in width : 2ft 11ins length : 2ft power : 250cc four - cylinder petrol engine ‘ boat ’ length : 10ft 7 inches height : 2ft 3 inches weight : 649 lbs @entity182 ’s website notes : ‘ as soon as sufficient lift is applied , you and the jetpack become weightless and levitate in the air and even small amounts of force will move or turn you			1
' you will feel some pressure from the saddle and the trapeze , but usually no more than from riding a bicycle			0
’ but pilots must be 18 years old			0
and @entity243 cautions : ‘ you must be a good swimmer and should not feel uncomfortable having your face in the water from time to time			0
' you should not have a fear of heights			0
' you should be in good health and physical condition			0
' you should have no history of any heart conditions and flying is not advised for women who are pregnant			0
’ last month , hotel manager @entity254 , 25 , and his fiancé and @entity256 tied the knot in the world ’s first jet pack wedding at a ceremony in the @entity52 they each flew to the beachside ceremony at @entity263 in @entity264 wearing @entity182 water - powered jet pack			1
after exchanging vows the newlyweds performed an airborne first dance - above the water - to @entity271 ’s ‘ @entity270 ’			2
the daring couple , from @entity273 , @entity274 , became engaged on an adventure holiday to @entity276 in april .			0

@entity1 , 51 , uses £ 115k device to make 40 - mile journey along @entity39
can lift him 30ft in the air and propel him forward at speeds of up to 25mph
inspired by contraption used by @entity10 in 1965 film @entity114
mr @entity1 : ' it ’s better than sitting in traffic jam or stuck on crowded train '
