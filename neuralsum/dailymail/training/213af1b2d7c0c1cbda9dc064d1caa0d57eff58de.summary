by @entity1 reporter published : 10:56 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 16:18 est , 8 august 2012 @entity2 has been dealt yet another blow as three of its top executives have announced they are quitting the social networking company			2
director of platform partnerships , @entity8 , director of platform marketing , @entity10 , and mobile platform marketing manager , @entity12 , have handed in their resignations			1
they are just the latest top - ranking employees to quit the @entity16 - based company , which has lost a handful of execs following its poorly received ipo in may and tumbling share prices			1
resignations : three more @entity2 execs have quit , including director of platform partnerships @entity8 ( left ) , and @entity10 ( right ) , director of platform marketing			1
both are starting new ventures their announcements - shared on their @entity2 pages - come after the high - profile exits of chief technology officer @entity31 in june , and open graph product manager @entity32 last month			1
' it is with mixed emotions that i 'm letting you all know that i 've decided to leave @entity2 to seek my next adventure , ' @entity8 wrote on his @entity2 page			2
' i 'm exceptionally proud of the team we 've built and the work we 've done and i 'm incredibly enthusiastic about the future of @entity2 ... and know that i 'm leaving it in the good hands			0
' @entity10 , who will be working at a mobile startup , wrote : ' after an amazing two years at @entity2 , it 's time to start my next entrepreneurial adventure			2
i 'm so grateful to have met , learned from and worked with the incredible people here			0
' out the door : @entity12 ( left ) , @entity2 's mobile platform marketing manager , has also handed in his resignation			1
it comes two months after @entity31 ( right ) , chief technology officer quit farewell : @entity2 's director of platform products @entity32 , pictured unveiling the social networking site 's @entity56 in january this year , left the company in june the resignations , which come as @entity2 struggles with plummeting share prices , will only serve to rattle the company further			1
it lost a staggering $ 157 million in the second quarter of this year and saw shares , which were released in a highly - anticipated ipo in may , fall to $ 20.72 from their $ 38 starting price			1
last week , shares hit an all - time low of $ 19.82 after the company posted its disappointing earnings			0
@entity2 's initial valuation has plummeted from $ 100 billion to $ 43.5 billion , while ceo @entity71 saw his personal fortune collapse from $ 13.7 billion to $ 10 billion over the last fortnight			0
but the company has defended the drain of talent , pointing out that new employees are joining the company on a weekly basis , which constantly helps the development of ideas			0
' we 're fortunate to have many , many talented people join the company each week , and we believe this will serve us well over the long run , ' @entity2 spokesman @entity80 said in a statement			2
crash : @entity2 ceo @entity71 at the ipo launch in may - but shares have almost halved since plummeting : last week , @entity2 share prices hit an all time low of $ 19.82 - down from its original $ 38 social - media analyst @entity92 warned that @entity94 is rife with start ups , and many @entity2 employees are going on to begin their own companies			1
' start - up junkies get restless after a few years , ' @entity92 told @entity99			0
' this is not a time to lose top talent			0
that is @entity2 's challenge			0
' these fledgling departures are definitely true of @entity2 ; @entity8 worked at the company for four years , yet @entity10 was there for two years and @entity12 only lasted one			1
@entity10 and @entity12 likely received stock before the ipo and will keep it despite their departures ; they could be betting the stock will not gain so much value over the next couple of years that they will miss out on a large payout , @entity99 reported			2
concerns : these latest resignations of top - ranking employees will only serve to shake @entity2 further while @entity2 has suffered devastating losses , the day most investors are bracing for is november 14 , when more than 1.2 billion shares will suddenly be available for trading			1
the imminent lock - up expiration also means that @entity124 analysts who participated in the @entity125 will once again go quiet , for a 30 - day period , potentially creating more uncertainty			0
' the sentiment on this thing is so negative , ' said @entity130 analyst @entity129			0
' i think this thing may continue to tick down until you see some sort of meaningful catalyst which unfortunately may not show until third - quarter earnings			0

director of platform partnerships @entity8 and director of platform marketing @entity10 quit last week ' to start new ventures '
mobile platform marketing manager @entity12 also out the door
brings resignations of top - ranking employees to five since june
comes as share prices drop to $ 20.72 from the $ 38 starting price
@entity2 : new employees start every week and this will serve us well
