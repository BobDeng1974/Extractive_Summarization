despite being caught and jailed , the ' mystery ' thief still refuses to reveal her own true identity by @entity3 last updated at 1:44 am on 21st june 2011 one is a white , @entity5 - born housewife from the @entity6			1
the other is a younger black woman , thought to be from @entity8			2
but despite their obvious differences , the @entity10 woman was able to spend 15 years travelling on a @entity5 passport in the unsuspecting @entity5 woman 's name			1
the astonishing deception only came to light after the real @entity18 tried to renew her passport – and was interrogated to find out whether she was who she claimed to be			1
the anonymous woman thought to be from @entity8 , left , had spent 15 years travelling on a @entity5 passport using the identity of @entity18 after the 53 - year - old provided proof of her identity , including decades - old school records , an alert was raised for the mystery black woman travelling the world using her name			1
the bogus @entity18 , thought to be an illegal immigrant , was finally arrested following a break in @entity34 with her unsuspecting television producer boyfriend			1
yesterday she was beginning a nine - month prison sentence for fraudulent use of a passport – but still refusing to divulge her real identity			2
even the partner she had been living with , 54 - year - old former gladiators producer @entity41 , last night admitted he did n't have a clue who she really was			2
the case highlights worrying loopholes in @entity5 's border security – and raises the prospect that unless the impostor reveals her identity , she can not be deported when she is freed			1
@entity51 : officials there discovered the imposter - but she had been living a lie since 1989 and had got several passports in the name of @entity18 before detection her victim , who has used her married name of @entity62 since 1982 , said : ' it is a bit silly really because mine is a very unusual name and she is apparently about 20 years younger than me			1
' she is of @entity10 appearance and i am not			2
neither are any of my family			0
how she thought she was going to travel and get away with it i will never know			0
' the impostor obtained a copy of @entity18 's birth certificate in 1989 and used to it obtain a passport in that name in 1995			1
she renewed the passport in 2005			0
but when former bank worker @entity79 applied to renew her passport in 2009 , tighter anti-fraud checks highlighted the clash and she was called in for interview			0
the mother - of - two , from @entity84 , said : ' they said there was already one in my name with the same details			0
i had to go for an interview and prove who i was			0
' i had to take in school documents and the passport authorities asked me questions about my family			0
they did eventually issue me with a passport and i was told that unless this woman used the passport that she had to travel , it would not flag up and they would not be able to chase her			0
' i must admit i thought she was never going to be caught			2
' but last november , the bogus @entity18 flew into @entity51 and was challenged by immigration officers			1
the impostor was unable to give any information to support her claim to be the real @entity18 , insisting she suffered from memory loss			1
she was jailed for nine months at @entity109 , @entity51 , for fraudulent use of a passport			2
prosecutor @entity112 said : ' she is wilfully refusing to identify herself properly , or give her country of origin			0
' @entity115 , defending , said medical tests had shown her client to be displaying symptoms of depression and mental health ' fragilities '			0
judge @entity121 told her : ' you have fooled a number of people , and have been living a lie for a number of years			0
' your real identity , it would appear to everybody , remains something of a mystery			1
' she could face further action , including contempt of court , if she fails to tell the truth			0
when mr @entity41 was asked if he knew the woman 's real identity yesterday at the flat they shared in @entity141 , @entity51 , he replied : ' i have n't got a clue			1
' immigration sources said she was believed to be originally from @entity146 or @entity8 and to have arrived in @entity5 before fingerprints were routinely taken with visa applications			1
the @entity149 said such a case could not happen today due to tougher anti-fraud measures			0
for example , fingerprints are now taken from overseas visa applicants seeking to travel to @entity5 and are kept on file			2
the impostor also obtained a driving licence under the name @entity18			1
investigators are expected to examine whether she fraudulently claimed benefits during her two decades living a lie .			0
