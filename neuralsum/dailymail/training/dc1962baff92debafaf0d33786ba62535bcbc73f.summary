education minister @entity0 said schools were free to teach about porn schools are free to give lessons in pornography , an education minister has admitted despite concerns about the impact of hardcore images on children			1
campaigners have warned that growing numbers of youngsters are hooked on graphic films found online			2
while lessons on pornography would focus on the impact and dangers of graphic images online , they could backfire by alerting children to what can be easily accessed on the internet			1
@entity21 is preparing to make it easier for parents to block online porn from new computers			1
but @entity0 insisted lessons in porn can form part of ‘ age appropriate ’ studies			1
some teaching unions have called for students to be taught about porn from the age of 10			2
but an alarming study last month revealed children as young as 11 are becoming addicted to internet pornography giving them ' unrealistic expectations ' of sex			1
counsellors at @entity42 also report a surge in calls from youngsters traumatised after seeing adult images online			2
the intervention by @entity48 comes a month after a teaching union called for students to be taught porn from the age of 10 , so that they know about the dangers and can protect themselves from stumbling across adult images			0
the green light from a minister could encourage more schools to institute lessons in pornography – a development which will alarm many parents			1
she said : ‘ the government wants all young people to have high quality , age appropriate sex and relationships education			0
‘ the current non-statutory programmes of study for @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 ( @entity73 ) education , which include sex and relationship education , can provide opportunities for schools to teach about pornography			1
’ @entity73 , which includes sex and relationships education , is not compulsory in @entity79 unlike other parts of the @entity81			0
last night @entity83 , from pressure group @entity82 , said : ‘ bringing pornography into the classroom will introduce sexual images to many children who have not encountered them before and will arouse in some pupils a curiosity to search out more images for themselves			1
it will not solve anything and will only compound the problem			0
‘ most parents would far rather the government introduce an opt - in system to limit the risk of their children accessing sexual images online in the first place than add pornography to the school curriculum			1
‘ talking freely and openly about sexual matters with young children in the classroom has the potential to break down their natural sense of reserve and encourage casual attitudes towards sex			0
‘ if we want children to view sexual intimacy as something valuable , special and worthy of respect , we need to treat it with modesty and restraint			0
to give lessons on pornography is to play with fire			1
’ while lessons on pornography would focus on the impact and dangers of graphic images online , they could backfire by alerting children to what can be easily accessed on the internet			1
@entity21 is ready to take action to curb online porn			1
anyone buying a new computer or signing up with a new internet service provider will be asked whether they have children when they log on for the first time			0
those answering ‘ yes ’ will automatically be taken through the process of installing anti-pornography filters and a series of questions about how stringent they want restrictions to be			0
it follows a series of alarming cases of boys watching porn before attacking other children			1

some teaching unions have called for the impact of pornography to be taught in schools ( file picture ) in june this year a 14 - year - old boy who raped a nine - year - old girl after watching hard - core pornography online was spared jail			1
his lawyer said the boy , who was just 12 at the time of the attack , wanted to feel grown up			0
@entity198 , defending the boy , said : ‘ there is a real risk that young people are growing up with a skewed view of what sex is and sexual @entity204 more : @entity206 on @entity207 @entity208 on @entity209 @entity210 , defending the boy , said : ‘ there is a real risk that young people are growing up with a skewed view of what sex is and sexual activity			0
' ms @entity0 was responding to a parliamentary question from @entity219 mp @entity218 , who said how children find out about pornography was a matter for parents not teachers			1
‘ this is a matter for parents to make a judgement on , ’ mr @entity218 said			1
‘ i do n’t think it is a matter for school teachers			2
@entity219 mp @entity218 said it should be a matter for parents not teachers ‘ there is a general concern across the country that these things are becoming far too accessible for young people and the moral side of this needs to be upheld			1
‘ guidance on young people is something that is something we need to ensure is there , rather than let this sort of thing become too prevalent			0
’ the @entity208 is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children			1
over- 18s would only be able to access adult images if they opt in following a strict age verification check			0
last week the deputy children ’s commissioner , @entity252 , said the impact of online porn was at least partly to blame for almost a half of cases of gang - based sex attacks			1
she said the easy access of porn online skewed young people 's views about what is ' acceptable , required or expected ' of sex , and could leave boys seeing girls as ' objects to be used and abused '			2
last month the @entity267 of @entity268 ( @entity269 ) called for porn to be taught in lessons from the age of 10			2
policy adviser @entity273 said : ‘ children are growing up in an overtly sexualised world			0
‘ that includes easy access to porn and they need the skills to deal with it			0
’ the union called for teaching about the impact of pornography to be included ‘ as part of a statutory @entity286 ( @entity73 ) programme ’			2
‘ evidence suggests 10 is n't too young to start lessons on pornography , but it would n't be a full on lesson but the grounding would be laid down			2
’ the @entity293 said referring to issues of porn in lessons is a step too far and that schools should only talk about it if asked by students			1
@entity219 mp @entity302 , a member of the @entity303 select committee , said any lessons on pornography would have to be handled sensitively			1
' it is much better for schools to take control of this issue rather than simply allow children to find images on their phones in the playground			2
' it would be naive to think that you could just prevent children getting access to these images			0
' @entity318 , head of the @entity321 ’s @entity320 programme said : ' it ’s a good thing for children to learn that porn does not mirror real - life and gives a distorted view of sex			2
' as long as this is explained in an age - appropriate way , with the consent of parents where necessary , it can help children form healthy relationships based on care and respect			2
' last night a spokesman for the @entity338 said : ‘ obviously the minister was saying that @entity73 could give schools a chance to teach children about the dangers of pornography – something which is a growing problem in our schools that parents are rightly very concerned about			1
