i enjoyed every moment we shared ; the great ones , the sad ones , the easy and the hard			0
i pray they have learned to feel the deep sense of faith that i shared			0
no matter where this journey brings me next , i will forever carry their love with me , as i am sure there is a piece of me that will forever remain with them			0
but cancer does not care who it takes , who it hurts , or honor or love			2
it comes into your life and starts to break the threads that hold you and you are left to see pieces of yourself slip away and dreams fade			2
we were clung only to each other with pure love and faith binding us , in the end is when the most amazing thing happens , cancer loses its strength and grace appears			2
we need to see it			0
we accept it , and go with it			0
@entity299 and love win , not cancer			2
