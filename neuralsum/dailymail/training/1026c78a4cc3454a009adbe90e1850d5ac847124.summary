for ten months , he had been lying in a hospital bed , unconscious and unresponsive			1
the injuries @entity3 had suffered in a motorbike crash were so severe that his devastated family were warned he may never wake up			1
but then came the phone call that would change everything			2
from her home in @entity10 7,000 miles away , mr @entity3 ’s fiancee @entity8 chatted to him – and at the sound of her voice , tears began trickling down his cheek			1
true love : @entity3 showed the first signs of life since his accident when his @entity10 fiancee @entity19 spoke to him down the phone heady days : the couple fell in love and got engaged after mr @entity3 moved to @entity23 to teach @entity24 miss @entity8 was forced to return home to @entity10 after a three - month visa ran out it was the first time the 31 - year - old had shown any sign of recovery since fracturing his skull in the horrific accident on the @entity23 island			1
now , every time the phone rings , mr @entity3 reaches out his hand			1
describing the moment mr @entity3 first responded to his fiancee ’s voice , his stepfather @entity36 said : ‘ he had tears in his eyes as we held the phone to his ear			1
she asked him something and he said a silent yes			2
‘ then tears were coming down his face			1
’ now , mr @entity3 ’s mother @entity51 calls miss @entity8 , known as @entity19 , and passes the phone towards her son			1
mr @entity36 said : ‘ as soon as he hears her voice he lifts his hand for the phone			2
he listens to her and you can see this change in him			2
’ mr @entity3 , from @entity58 , @entity59 , met @entity60 , 27 , after he moved to @entity23 in 2009 to teach @entity24			1
the couple planned to get married , but mr @entity3 was knocked down while riding a motorcycle in @entity10 on july 9 last year			1
as well as a fractured skull , he had to have his eye socket reconstructed , using bone taken from his thigh			2
following surgery , he slipped into a coma and has remained in a vegetative state ever since			2
mr @entity3 had no medical insurance , so his family were forced to raise £ 100,000 for him to be treated in @entity10			1
his father , @entity72 , contributed £ 50,000 of his savings , while mr @entity36 remortgaged his home to find the remaining £ 50,000			1
mr @entity3 , 31 , moved to @entity23 18 months before his horrific motorbike accident emotional moment : it was ms @entity8 's voice that triggered mr @entity3 's first signs of life as he lay in a hospital bed @entity82 apart : mr @entity3 's family were amazed when he moved his hand and tears streamed down his face as his fiancee spoke to him over the phone from the other side of the world a coma is state in which a person is unaware of both self and external surroundings and unable to consciously feel , speak , hear , or move			1
doctors monitor consciousness levels by assessing eye opening , verbal responses and voluntary movements			2
a higher score on the scale suggests that less brain function has been lost			0
the cause of a coma and age of the patient are important in determining whether they will recover			0
some people remember events from when they were in a coma , while others do not			0
most memories are likely to relate to the period when they were emerging from the coma			0
some people recall feeling reassured by the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma			0
a coma usually lasts for less than two to four weeks			0
it is unusual to remain in a coma for months or even years			0
generally , the longer the person has been in a coma , the poorer the outlook			0
people do not usually suddenly ' wake up ' from a coma , but regain brain function over time			2
patients emerging from comas are often agitated and confused and may need to be sedated for their safety			0
in october , mr @entity3 was transferred back to @entity133 , and his parents have kept a bedside vigil at @entity136 ever since			1
miss @entity8 managed to secure a visa so she could join them at his bedside for three months , but after that she was forced to return home to @entity10 , where she studies @entity142 literature at the @entity143			1
since the first phone call three weeks ago , mr @entity3 has slowly started to recover more movement in his body			1
‘ he ’s really come on , ’ said mr @entity36			0
‘ he is still in a low awareness coma but he moves his hand left and right when the phone rings			0
we are so pleased he is recovering			0
we spend most of our days at hospital and some days are good and others bad but we take what we can get			2
‘ we are just happy he is responding			0
yesterday @entity154 , spokesman for brain injury charity @entity155 , said mr @entity3 could now make a full recovery			1
he said : ‘ @entity159 arousal programmes are often used to try to stimulate patients who are in reduced states of consciousness , such as a coma or a persistent vegetative state			0
‘ these carefully planned periods of stimulation – in the form of sound , touch , smell and taste – are combined with periods of complete rest in order not to overload the person ’s senses			0
‘ while each individual case is different , in general terms the longer a person remains in a state of reduced consciousness , the less likely they are to make a full recovery			0
‘ we have heard of several examples of people waking from comas and going on to make good recoveries and live happy , fulfilled lives			0
‘ examples like this demonstrate that coma arousal programmes may well be effective			0
’ miraculous : doctors feared mr @entity3 would never regain consciousness after the crash in @entity10 overjoyed : ms @entity8 was forced to return to @entity10 after her visa ran out - but now she has hope that their wedding will finally take place			1
