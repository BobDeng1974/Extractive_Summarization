accountant mr @entity144 , 65 , who lives in the other house next door to mrs @entity50 , described hearing ' hysterical screaming and barking ' as he watched television			0

they have a pack mentality - so the others started doing it too			0
' it survived initially and they wrapped it in a blanket , but it later passed away from shock			0
they are not the sort of dogs you would want to mess with			0
' two of the dogs are @entity56 @entity55 mastiffs which is known as a well - natured , docile breed , according to expert @entity234			1
