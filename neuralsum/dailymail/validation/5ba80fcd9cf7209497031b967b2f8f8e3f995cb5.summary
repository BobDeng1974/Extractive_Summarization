@entity0 launched a bizarre class - war attack on @entity2 yesterday as plans for election tv debates descended into acrimony and farce			1
the deputy prime minister accused his boss of a ‘ @entity10 attitude ’ after he brought an end to years of negotiations on the terms of debates			1
mr @entity2 claimed he was ‘ unblocking the logjam ’ by agreeing to take part in one contest featuring seven party leaders but ruling out two further debates			1
he attacked broadcasters for ‘ the mess ’ they had made of plans for debates and accused them of wanting to talk about no other issues			2
however , even the single seven - way debate is in doubt after the @entity29 said @entity31 ’s @entity30 – the fourth largest in @entity32 – would not be allowed to take part			2
the @entity30 is threatening a judicial review			0
@entity2 tonight insisted he was not putting obstacles in the way of televised leaders ' debates mr @entity2 insisted he was not putting obstacles in the way of televised leaders ' debates after he was accused of treating the public with ' lofty pomposity ' by telling tv bosses how the debates are going to happen			1
labour aides pointed out that the prime minister had mocked @entity47 for initially refusing to take part in three debates in 2010			1
at prime minister ’s questions in 2008 , mr @entity2 also suggested mr @entity47 was ‘ frightened ’ of tv debates			1
labour leader @entity53 said that the prime minister was ' cowering from the public ' , after @entity55 rejected broadcasters ' proposals for three tv debates during the election campaign and made a ' final offer ' of a single 90 - minute show featuring at least seven party leaders to take place before the official start of the campaign on march 30			1
mr @entity53 added the prime minister was ‘ running away from the face - to - face debate with me that he said he wanted and that the public deserve ’			1
@entity0 leader @entity0 said that he was willing to take the pm 's place in the one - on - one debate with mr @entity53 if mr @entity2 refused to turn up for the clash , scheduled to be shown on @entity71 and @entity72 on april 30 - exactly a week before the may 7 election			1
he was accused of treating the public like @entity10 's @entity75 by telling tv bosses how the debates are going to happen mr @entity0 said he was ' bemused by the lofty pomposity of the @entity79 ' adding : ' they 're behaving as if they 're ordering a drink in the drawing room of @entity10			1
' it 's not for the @entity79 to start telling people how these debates are going to happen , they belong to the @entity89 people			2
' if @entity2 is too important or too busy to bother to actually defend the record of this government in a debate with @entity53 then , yeah , i 'll offer up myself to do it instead			2
' but @entity95 dismissed the suggestion as ' ridiculous ' , suggesting that the deputy prime minister should instead debate with their deputy leader @entity98			1
if the @entity46 did not turn up , mr @entity53 was ready to subject himself to a solo grilling by presenter @entity100 and a studio audience , said @entity95 campaign chair @entity102			2
@entity105 's @entity104 said mr @entity2 was trying to ' sabotage ' the debates			0
mr @entity0 said he was ' bemused by the lofty pomposity of the @entity79 ' adding : ' they 're behaving as if they 're ordering a drink in the drawing room of @entity10 ' the @entity111 said it would be a ' national embarrassment ' if the debates did not go ahead			1
in a process of negotiations stretching over months , mr @entity2 has previously raised objections to broadcasters ' proposals , first on the grounds that they excluded the @entity121 , and then that the @entity30 had been left out			0
@entity95 have accused the @entity122 of working behind the scenes to scupper the live broadcasts - first tried in a @entity89 general election in 2010			0
speaking during a visit to @entity129 , the prime minister insisted he had been ' completely consistent ' on the debates , saying : ' i have n't put hurdles in the way , the broadcasters came up with a series of proposals that other people realised were flawed			1
' i am unblocking the log jam and saying let 's have this seven - cornered debate and get on with it before the campaign			2
labour leader @entity53 said that the prime minister was ' cowering from the public ' ' then we can actually do what needs to be done , which is to get round the country during the election campaign			1
' he rejected claims that staging the debates before party manifestos are published would limit the opportunity to scrutinise their plans , insisting : ' everyone knows what the conservative proposals are and the @entity95 proposals are , and the other parties can speak for themselves			2
' mr @entity53 said he was ready to debate the prime minister ' any time , any place , anywhere '			1
' it is now clear that @entity2 is ducking the debate with me			0
he is cowering from the public , ' said mr @entity53			2
' the @entity89 people deserve this debate			0
i 'll debate him any time , any place , anywhere			0
he should stop ducking and weaving and name the date			0
' the @entity53 's comment echoed mr @entity2 's own 2007 challenge to @entity47 to face him in a tv debate , when he said : ' any time , anywhere			2
i will even pay for the taxi to take him ( @entity47 ) to the studio			0
in fact , i 'll even drive the cab			0
' meanwhile , mr @entity0 said he would happily take his coalition partner 's place and spare the nation from an ' @entity53 monologue '			1
mr @entity2 's latest terms for taking part have been set out in a letter from his director of communications , @entity186 , to @entity187 , chairwoman of the broadcasters ' leaders ' debates committee			0
in a joint statement , the @entity29 , @entity191 , @entity72 and @entity71 said they would respond to the @entity79 ' proposal in due course			0
as well as the april 30 two - leader clash , the broadcasters have proposed seven - way debates also involving mr @entity0 and the leaders of @entity105 , the @entity121 , @entity199 and the @entity200 on @entity191 on april 2 and @entity29 on april 16			1
@entity104 accused the prime minister of having ' sabotaged the whole thing ' while @entity0 said he was prepared to take the @entity204 's place in a one - to - one debate against @entity53 asked if he thought mr @entity2 was running scared , mr @entity104 said : ' yes , he is			1
he has sabotaged the whole thing			0
' he has now said he will do one debate , but he will do it before the proper campaign starts , so it 's not going to be a proper debate			0
' the @entity105 leader told @entity191 's loose women : ' i suspect , had it been a four - headed debate , there are one or two conversations i wanted to have with the prime minister that i do n't think he would have been able to answer			1
i suspect that 's why they have sabotaged it			0
' a spokesman for the @entity121 said : ' not only is @entity2 's announcement cowardly but it also shows his contempt for the electorate			0
people want to see a set of debates between all major party leaders , yet the prime minister is clearly scared of scrutiny			1
' @entity111 chief executive @entity231 said : ' this unseemly squabble over tv debates has to end now			2
' i have to say to the prime minister that if he really thinks that these exchanges once a week are a substitute for a proper television debate , then he is even more out of touch than i thought … i have to ask him : what on earth is he frightened of ? ' - @entity2 to @entity47 at @entity242 , 2008 ' what i have done is to unblock the logjam the broadcasters helped to create and said let ’s get on and have the debate that i think matters the most , which is the one that gives everybody a say , and let ’s get on with it before the campaign			1
so hopefully , by putting forward this proposal for a debate , we will actually see one take place			0
' - @entity2 , 2015 ' compared to other advanced democracies around the world , @entity89 has been extremely late to the party when it comes to tv debates			1
it would be a national embarrassment if we end up being the first to leave that party as well			0
' no tv debates in 2015 would be a backward step in terms of our democratic development			2
' @entity200 leader @entity271 said : ' @entity2 is clearly running scared of having to answer for his government 's record of failure and incompetence - and this arrogance in trying to lay down the law is all about getting out of debates , not taking part			0
' i will debate him any time , anywhere , on any number of occasions			0
however we have accepted the broadcasters ' proposals , and believe we should stick with that , rather than allow a @entity79 prime minister to dictate the terms of debate			1
' the @entity291 said it had rejected the @entity30 's appeal to be included in the debates format			0
a panel said there was no evidence the corporation had made an ' error in principle ' or acted unfairly by refusing the party 's claim			0
a @entity30 spokesman said it was prepared to launch a judicial review of the decision if any debates were going ahead			0
broadcasters are still considering going ahead with three debates , and believe they may have legal grounds to ‘ empty - chair ’ the @entity122 on the basis that they turned down an invitation , but rules requiring political balance will make such a programme difficult .			0

@entity55 has rejected broadcasters ' proposals for three tv debates
made a ' final offer ' of single 90 - minute show featuring seven party leaders
the debate would also have to take place before the start of the campaign
@entity0 said he was ' bemused ' by ' lofty pomposity of the @entity79 '
