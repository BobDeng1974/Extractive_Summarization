@entity0 were in turmoil on wednesday after their @entity3 corruption investigator quit in protest at the systematic cover - up of his own report			1
@entity8 ’s resignation statement could not have been more damning			1
the @entity10 lawyer accused @entity0 — and especially their ethics judge @entity11 — of a wholesale whitewash of the murky @entity13 2018 and @entity15 bid campaigns			1
@entity8 ’s bombshell plunged world football ’s wholly discredited ruling body into yet another crisis			1
@entity21 president @entity20 was the first to react , calling the sorry saga a ‘ new failure for @entity0 ’			1
@entity8 has resigned from @entity0 's ethics committee and cited a ' lack of leadership ' @entity8 alleged that @entity0 had not only swept his findings under the carpet but tried to silence him by reporting him to their own disciplinary committee for speaking out			1
he also accused @entity11 of having no independence and claims @entity0 ’s ingrained culture of self - preservation under @entity34 meant it was impossible to bring about change			2
@entity8 said : ‘ it is the lack of leadership on these issues within @entity0 that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end			1
no independent governance committee , investigator or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation			2
’ and @entity8 , who was head of @entity0 ’s ethics investigatory arm , went as far as saying about his colleague @entity11 ’s conclusions : ‘ when viewed in the context of the report it purported to summarise , no principled approach could justify the @entity11 decision ’s edits , omissions and additions			1
’ he added that he had ‘ lost confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber ’			0
@entity8 's report was only published as a summary by @entity0 , something @entity8 himself quickly denounced @entity8 believes there has been a massive cover - up which he also fears will be the last word on the 2018 and 2022 bids			1
he chose to resign on the eve of @entity0 ’s executive committee meeting in @entity71 , which is due to vote on making his full report public , albeit with redactions where there are issues of confidentiality			1
clearly , he believes there is no chance of this happening , especially as the @entity0 appeals committee earlier this week turned down his complaint about @entity11 ’s ‘ numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions ’			1
his appeal was dismissed on the bizarre grounds that @entity11 ’s summary was not legally binding			0
the timing of his exit , along with his incendiary comments , now puts huge pressure on the 26 - strong @entity93 to vote for full publication			0
the move to publish was unlikely to have received the necessary majority before @entity8 ’s intervention but his views might have changed a few minds			2
@entity13 , @entity100 and @entity101 were accused of breaking rules during the 2018 and 2022 bids in the report july 2012 @entity0 appoint @entity105 lawyer @entity8 and @entity106 judge @entity11 to their @entity107			1
@entity8 is brought in to investigate bidding for the 2018 and 2022 @entity109			1
september 2014 @entity8 submits his 350 - page report			2
@entity11 says it will not be made public , with only his summary published			0
october 2014 @entity8 , among others , calls for the report to be published in full and says of @entity0 : ‘ ( the ) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard ... ( it ) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution			1
’ november 2014 @entity11 publishes his summary , which clears @entity13 and @entity100 of corruption , but claims @entity101 had undermined the integrity of bidding during their 2018 bid campaign			1
@entity8 says the findings contain ‘ erroneous representations ’ , and says he will appeal			1
december 2014 @entity0 dismiss @entity8 ’s complaint to their @entity129			1
@entity8 resigns from the @entity107			2
@entity8 , who was appointed by @entity0 to probe the two @entity3 bid campaigns in july 2012 , announced through his law firm @entity131 : ‘ for the first two years i felt that the ethics committee was making real progress			1
but in recent months that changed			0
‘ the report myself and deputy @entity135 submitted identified serious and wide - ranging issues with the bidding and selection process			0
‘ soon after , @entity11 indicated only limited information would be made public			0
concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve @entity0 ’s interests , i issued a public statement calling on the @entity143 to authorise appropriate publication			2
‘ the @entity143 took no action on this subject other than to refer me to the disciplinary committee for violating the ethics code through my public comments about publication and watches given to certain football officials			2
’ @entity8 and @entity11 pictured together earlier this year at @entity0 headquarters in @entity154 the disciplinary committee , not surprisingly , rejected @entity0 ’s complaint against their investigator			1
@entity8 , who will not take his case to the @entity158 , had a final swipe at @entity0 ’s tarnished leadership			1
he said : ‘ it now appears that at least for the foreseeable future , the @entity11 decision will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 @entity3 bidding process			0
‘ and while the @entity11 decision made me lose confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber , it is the lack of leadership on these issues within @entity0 that leads me to conclude my role in this process is at an end			1
’ however the prosecutions launched by @entity8 against five senior football officials — including @entity106 great @entity177 and @entity143 members @entity179 of @entity180 , @entity182 ’s @entity181 and @entity183 of @entity184 — can still be carried on by @entity8 ’s deputy @entity135			1
@entity0 president @entity34 ( right ) hands over the @entity3 trophy to @entity189 meanwhile @entity190 , chairman of the compliance committee , has the role of deciding today what portions of @entity8 ’s work the @entity143 should see			1
prince @entity195 , an advocate of reform who was the first inside the @entity143 to call for the report to be published , said last night : ‘ it ’s a shame that we have lost @entity8 , for whom we had tremendous respect			2
it was a shock to hear and he must have done it for a reason			2
it is emblematic of some of the challenges @entity0 have			2
’ @entity0 ’s @entity208 vice-president @entity207 said : ‘ i am totally shocked			2
the ethics committee was our most important group			1
’ for the first two years after my july 2012 appointment as independent chairman of the @entity214 's @entity213 , i felt that the @entity107 was making real progress in advancing ethics enforcement at @entity0			1
in recent months , that changed			0
on september 5 , 2014 , i and @entity135 , the deputy chair of the @entity213 , sent a ' report on the @entity219 into the 2018/2022 @entity220 ' ( the ' report ' ) to the @entity214 's @entity221			0
the @entity218 identified serious and wide - ranging issues with the bidding and selection process			0
( mr @entity135 also filed separate reports from his inquiries into the activities of the bid teams from @entity13 and the @entity105			1
) soon after , the chairman of the @entity221 , @entity11 - @entity11 , indicated publicly that only limited information from the @entity218 would be made public			0
concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve @entity0 's interests , i issued a public statement calling on the @entity234 to authorise the appropriate publication of the report			2
the @entity234 took no action on this subject during its september 2014 meetings - other than to refer me to the @entity240 for allegedly violating the @entity241 through my public comments , namely , my public request that the @entity234 authorise appropriate publication of the @entity218 and the on - the - record statement mr @entity135 and i released concerning watches given to certain football officials			0
the chairman of the @entity240 , @entity248 , ultimately rejected the @entity234 's referral			0
on november 13 , 2014 , mr @entity11 issued a 42 - page ' statement of the chairman of the @entity221 of the @entity214 on the report on the @entity219 into the 2018/2022 @entity220 prepared by the @entity213 of the @entity214 ' ( the ' @entity253 ' )			0
in a cover letter , mr @entity11 described the statement as his ' findings , including certain descriptions of the contents of the @entity213 's report			2
' the issues raised by mr @entity11 's selection and omission of material from the @entity218 , and his additional comments , went far beyond the initial transparency concerns			0
as my public statement at the time explained , the @entity253 contained ' numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions			0
' accordingly , i appealed			0
a brief i filed with the @entity273 on november 24 , 2014 , outlined the @entity253 's most serious failings			0
among other points , the brief explained why , when viewed in the context of the report it purported to summarize , no principled approach could justify the @entity253 's edits , omissions , and additions			0
yesterday 's decision by the @entity129 declined to address these points			0
instead , the @entity129 rejected my appeal on procedural grounds , concluding that ' it is not necessary for the @entity287 to enter into considerations on the substance of the appeal			0
' @entity291 found that the @entity253 was ' merely a personal opinion on the report ' and had ' no legally binding effect whatsoever			0
' it reached this conclusion even though , under @entity296 of the @entity241 , only ' final decisions ' may be made public , as the @entity253 , which was published on @entity0 's website , obviously was			2
the @entity129 also overlooked the @entity253 's self - described ' findings , ' including one stating that ' the evaluation of the 2018/2022 @entity302 bidding process is closed for the @entity214			0
' @entity0 president @entity34 recently reaffirmed that ' finding ' during an interview published by @entity0 , stating : ' furthermore , there is no change to judge @entity11 's statement that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity302 is concluded			1
' i disagree with the @entity129 's decision			0
it now appears that , at least for the foreseeable future , the @entity253 will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 @entity220 bidding process			0
while the @entity129 's decision notes that further appeal may be taken to the @entity158 , i have concluded that such a course of action would not be practicable in this case			0
no independent governance committee , investigator , or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation			0
and while the november 13 , 2014 , @entity326 made me lose confidence in the independence of the @entity221 , it is the lack of leadership on these issues within @entity0 that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end			1
accordingly , effective today , december 17 , 2014 , i am resigning as independent chairman of the @entity213 of the @entity214 .			0

@entity8 has resigned from the @entity0 ethics committee in protest
the @entity105 lawyer was *unhappy* with the way his findings were presented by @entity106 judge @entity342
@entity8 appealed against findings which cleared @entity100 and @entity13 to host 2022 and 2018 @entity109
he cited a ' lack of leadership ' as a reason for quitting the committee
