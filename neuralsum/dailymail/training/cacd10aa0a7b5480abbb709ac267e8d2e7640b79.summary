by @entity1 reporter published : 23:39 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 23:56 est , 16 august 2013 @entity3 governor @entity2 on friday acted on new legislation that will make it easier for children and teenagers suffering from serious illnesses to obtain medical marijuana			1
@entity2 agreed to sign the so - called pot - for - tots bill if the @entity3 legislature makes changes , including removing wording that would have reduced the number of required physician recommendations for children			1
he also agreed that children should be allowed access to edible forms of marijuana besides lozenges , considered difficult for young patients to use properly , but asked for tighter language in the bill to be sure only minors can get the medication			1
governor @entity2 : he has said he will sign a bill to help sick children get access to medical marijuana if lawmakers tweak the bill to ensure only qualifying patients get the drug pushing for change : @entity39 , @entity40 , asked gov. @entity2 to change the law in order that an edible form of medical marijuana -- not sold at dispensaries in the state -- becomes available for their sick child hope at last : @entity49 suffers from a severe form of epilepsy called @entity52			1
she started having seizures at two months old			0
they say she still seizes , on average , 15 times a day			0
her parents believe medicinal cannabis could help @entity2 agreed with other parts of the bill , including eliminating the three - strain cultivation limit on authorized dispensaries , which would allow growers to develop products tailored for individual patients , including some adults , according to proponents			1
@entity2 , who is running for re-election as @entity3 's governor and widely considered a contender for president in 2016 , gave his ' conditional ' approval to the bill but sent it back to the legislature with the suggested changes			1
@entity2 previously worried about going ' down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that would n't necessarily go to other people ' â€” and these modifications are perhaps a strategic compromise to not slide down the ' slippery slope			1
' ' today , i am making commonsense recommendations to this legislation to ensure sick children receive the treatment their parents prefer , while maintaining appropriate safeguards , ' @entity2 said in a statement released friday			1
' i am calling on the @entity92 to reconvene quickly and address these issues so that children in need can get the treatment they need			2
' ' as i have repeatedly noted , i believe that parents , and not government regulators , are best suited to decide how to care for their children , ' @entity2 continued			1
but some of the bill 's sponsors preferred the original language , which would open up the number of marijuana strains and ingestible forms to a wider range of patients , as well as an easier application process			1
change : for parents to get their kids the strains of marijuana they need three different doctors to sign off on the prescriptions for their kids but now it is hoped a change in the law will simplify things @entity121 : @entity49 , of @entity122 , @entity3 , is among a number of patients with legal authorization to receive medical marijuana			1
but , her parents say , she has yet to receive any medication due to the state 's restrictive medical marijuana program ' i think it is ironic that governor @entity2 believes that parents and government regulators should make the decision			2
this might be the most regulated law in the state , ' state sen. @entity135 , one of the primary sponsors of the bill , told @entity141 friday			0
' the last thing we want is to delay it for the kids , so we want to pass it as soon as possible , ' @entity135 continued			0
' it still requires too many unnecessary hurdles with physicians , but i do n't think we should hold it up anymore			0
' assemblyman @entity151 said older residents who ca n't ingest marijuana smoke should have access to an edible form			2
but he , too , prefers prompt action on the bill			0
@entity3 is one of 19 states with a medical marijuana program , but the state 's rules have made it difficult for young patients to enroll in treatment , according to proponents of the bill			1
the legislation has been sitting on @entity2 's desk for nearly two months and his conditional approval comes two days after he was confronted at a campaign stop by a @entity122 father whose 2 - year - old suffers from @entity52 , a potentially deadly form of epilepsy			2
@entity40 urged @entity2 in a restaurant full of voters to sign the bill saying , ' do n't let my daughter die			1
' @entity40 said the kind of marijuana that helps stop his daughter 's seizures currently is grown only in @entity184			0
simplified : if the bill is passed only one doctor 's authorization would be required for dispensing medical marijuana to a child			0
currently three doctors are required to sign off on a child 's prescription @entity40 told @entity141 's @entity193 : ' while it is a small victory ... it really just maintains the idea of making ( @entity3 ) one of the worst medical marijuana programs in the country			2
so it 's a small victory but it 's kind of ludicrous in a lot of ways			0
' @entity2 wants the state to keep the existing requirement of approval by at least a pediatrician and a psychiatrist for a child to be part of the medical marijuana program			2
' the psychiatrist is just a roadblock , ' @entity40 said			0
' there 's no rhyme or reason to have a psychiatrist be part of this decision			0
you 're talking about sick kids who are n't even mentally necessarily capable of talking			0
@entity49 ca n't even talk			0
' @entity2 acknowledged that marijuana is a controlled substance under @entity222 federal law and ' implementing a state controlled program while the drug remains illegal has raised numerous challenges			2
' the administration of president @entity228 has discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing people who distribute marijuana for medical purposes under state laws .			0

gov. @entity2 recommends two changes to bill before he signs it
@entity240 would remove limit on strains of cannabis that can offer in @entity3
patients would have access to other types of cannabis that would n't normally be available such as edible forms
@entity240 also would make it simpler for children to qualify
