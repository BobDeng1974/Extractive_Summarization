' i decided to cross over the road to see if i could rescue it but it was difficult because traffic was thundering past always in one lane or the other all the time			2
and nobody wanted to stop or even slow down for me or for the dog			0
' to say i was n't scared would be a lie , i was terrified and my heart was beating faster than i could have thought possible			0
' the woman lifts the injured dog into her arms and looks for a gap in the traffic @entity9 runs across the four lane motorway carrying the dog , amazingly making it to the hard shoulder without incident the drama unfolded on the hard shoulder of the highway between @entity57 and @entity58 , near the city of @entity60 , with traffic speeding past on the main artery			1
@entity9 's friend captured the heart - stopping moment she dashed across the motorway to try and reach the dog and her desperate attempts to gain its trust so she can lead it to safety			1
the nervy dog - clearly terrified - is seen moving away every time its rescuer tries to get near			0
brave : @entity75 climbs into the car with the dog on her lap before they take the injured animal to the nearest vets ' i needed to be patient , i tried slowly to coax him and eventually i managed to get to him and put my belt around his neck as a lead , ' said @entity9			0
' the next thing i was worried about was in case he tried to run forward into the traffic as i knew i would n't be able to hold him , but it all went well and i was able to seize the moment and cross back over to safety			0
' finally , the woman is seen lifting the dog up and managing to cross the busy motorway with it in her arms before loading it into the car to take for medical attention .			2
