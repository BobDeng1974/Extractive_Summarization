by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:31 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 17:32 est , 23 november 2013 @entity2 has risked angering @entity3 by praising the @entity5 football team who played their first match as a member of @entity9 last week diplomatic tensions between @entity11 and @entity3 were ratcheted up last night after a cabinet minister pledged to boost @entity5 ’s ambitions on the world sporting stage			1
culture secretary @entity2 taunted @entity3 by hailing a ‘ historic ’ match played by @entity5 ’s football team last week , after they were accepted by @entity9 , @entity19 football ’s governing body , and given the chance to compete in an international tournament for the first time			1
ms @entity2 ’s provocative intervention comes after the @entity3 mounted a doomed attempt to stop the friendly match against @entity26 – which ended in a 0 - 0 draw – by arguing the @entity28 was not a sovereign state			1
the minister is now promising to help other @entity32 teams to compete in international fixtures – a move designed to incense the @entity3			0
ms @entity2 , congratulating the @entity35 , said : ‘ i know it has been challenging for you to get to this point , with the odds seemingly stacked against you , but your tenacity has paid off and the results have made every resident of @entity5 proud			1
’ in a letter to @entity44 , the association ’s president , ms @entity2 said : ‘ a draw against @entity26 is a highly creditable result , given this was a team that qualified for the last @entity50 , and it certainly augurs well for the future			2
’ @entity5 will launch their @entity53 qualifying campaign next year			2
the letter , which has been seen by @entity55 , goes on defiantly : ‘ we are , as you will know , keen to support @entity5 ’s international ambitions			0
' in other sports @entity5 is struggling to get the international recognition it seeks and deserves , in part because of the approach , attitude and actions of @entity19 nations			2
‘ it goes without saying i unreservedly back you and @entity5 ’s case for recognition , whether that is in football , rugby union or in other sports			0
’ the match ended in a 0 - 0 draw which @entity2 said should make ' every resident of @entity5 proud ' the letter concludes : ‘ i look forward to the first match between @entity5 and one of the home nations			1
’ her intervention is likely to be more significant in the political than the sporting sphere			0
@entity5 has one full - sized football pitch , and the game had to be played 150 miles away in southern @entity85 – cheered on by about 500 fans in the 30,000 - capacity @entity87 – because their stadium does not meet @entity9 standards			1
with a population of just 30,000 , @entity5 replaces @entity92 ( 32,000 ) as the smallest nation to be accepted by @entity9			2
in tuesday ’s game , the team of amateurs was boosted by the inclusion of @entity99 professional @entity98 , whose grandmother came from the @entity28			0
ms @entity2 ’s move comes amid a growing war of words between @entity104 and @entity105 over the @entity28 , which @entity3 ceded to @entity11 in 1713			0
@entity5 and @entity3 will be kept apart in any qualifying football competitions .			0
