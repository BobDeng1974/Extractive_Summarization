she was given compassionate leave , favourable shifts and time off sick – because of depression – as her daughter was battling for her life , a court was told			1
it went on for two years but , incredibly , it was all a sham			0
@entity1 , 39 , invented the cancer story so she could go to show jumping events with her two daughters , who were both fit and well			1
yesterday she was jailed for 18 months for abusing the trust of her police employers and the colleagues who donated cash to help her supposedly sick child			1
judge @entity26 said her actions ‘ undermined the trust the police have in each other ’ as well as the ‘ trust the public has in the police ’			1
he told @entity1 : ‘ you told lies on top of lies over a long period			2
it was prolonged and cynical lying			0
‘ the type of lies you told were so emotive about a child having cancer no one would think they were false			0
that is why you were able to get away with it for so long			0
’ @entity1 had claimed daughter @entity46 , 15 , had to have chemotherapy and an operation to remove a tumour			1
she also told colleagues that the teenager was treated in a hospital intensive care unit and was feared to be terminally ill. bosses did not check her story or ask for documentation because no one believed the married mother - of - two would lie about such a thing , @entity53 heard			0
in reality @entity1 was devoting her time and energy to the budding equestrian careers of @entity46 and sister @entity64 , 13			1
the traffic constable with the @entity67 force started the scam in september 2009 and was not caught out until october 2011			0
con : @entity53 @entity53 heard that she had gained large sums of money from her deception instead of being in hospital or nursing her sick daughter , as she claimed , @entity1 was travelling to show jumping competitions			1
she also took a total of five months off sick , claiming to be depressed , at a cost to taxpayers of up to £ 15,000			0
lies : @entity1 spent most of her time developing the bugging equestrians careers of teenage daughters she was given ten days ’ compassionate leave and received £ 1,540 in pay in the process and police colleagues lost £ 150 , which had been donated to buy a portable dvd player and vouchers for @entity46			1
@entity90 , prosecuting , said that the public expected ‘ the highest levels of honesty and integrity ’ in police officers			2
@entity1 , of @entity96 , @entity97 , admitted two charges of fraud and misconduct in public office at an earlier hearing			1

the family are well - known in show jumping and @entity64 competed at the @entity109 last year			1
mr @entity90 told the court the con began when @entity1 claimed to be ill with swine flu			2
this coincided with a five - day show jumping festival			1
@entity1 then told her manager @entity46 had gone to a doctor after hurting her back falling off a horse and a lump had been discovered			2
in time , this ‘ lump ’ had to be removed and chemotherapy was required			0
she sent several emails saying she spent her days cleaning up sick and was not coping			0
after months off work through ‘ depression ’ she returned in january 2010 and was given shortened shifts , as well as fridays and weekends off			0
this enabled @entity1 to attend junior equestrian events			2
in may 2010 @entity46 was supposedly in hospital with pneumonia and in reality was competing in an @entity131 show , said mr @entity90			0
in another email , @entity1 even claimed ‘ there was a risk the cancer had spread to @entity46 ’s blood ’ and chemotherapy was only ‘ giving her time ’ .			2

@entity141 @entity1 said her daughter had *leukemia* and allowed colleagues to give her gifts and vouchers for the child
she said she needed time off but was in fact helping her girls with show jumping
@entity153 gave her compassionate leave and *special* shifts so she could help get daughter through her fabricated illness
