one of the brothers suspected of the @entity2 bombings had direct contact with @entity5 terrorists – and was ‘ monitored ’ by investigators for five years			1
the @entity7 has learned that the @entity8 put @entity9 , 26 , under surveillance after receiving an explicit warning from the @entity13 intelligence services			1
but despite apparently telling his mother that @entity9 was an ‘ extremist ’ leader , the @entity8 eventually discounted the possibility that he was a threat			1
he had been hiding in a boat in a suburban backyard			2
last night new details about @entity25 ’s dramatic capture were released			2
police said he fired at them from his hiding place but , weak through loss of blood from the bullet wounds he had sustained in the shoot - out with police earlier , he eventually gave himself up			2
‘ he was so weak that we were able to just go in and scoop him up , ’ said a police spokesman			2
@entity9 was a promising boxer before his ambitions were dashed by a back injury more details also emerged of the shoot - out after the brothers were cornered in a stolen @entity47 4x4			1
police said @entity9 burst out of the car shooting at officers			1
‘ there were six police officers in this very tight area engaged in a gunfight , ’ said police chief @entity51			0
‘ during the exchange , all of a sudden , something got thrown at my police officers and there was a major explosion , ’ he said			0
in all , there were three explosions and 200 rounds were fired during the five - to - ten minute exchange			2
it ended when @entity9 ran out of ammunition , he was on the ground being handcuffed when he was run over by his younger brother as he escaped in the car			1
while @entity25 ’s capture ended a week of tension and drama in @entity74 , triggering scenes of jubilation and self - congratulation among law enforcement officers , questions will now be asked about how the brothers managed to slip the net			2
@entity82 congressmen have expressed concern that the tip - off about @entity9 to the @entity8 from @entity85 may not have been properly followed through			1
yesterday the brothers ’ mother , @entity86 , said the @entity8 once told her that @entity9 was ‘ really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him ’			1
she added : ‘ he was controlled by the @entity8 for five years			1
they knew what my son was doing			0
they were following every step of his			0
’ and his father , @entity93 , said investigators warned his son : ‘ we know what sites you are on , we know where you are calling , we know everything about you			2
we are checking and watching			0
’ the brothers are believed to have placed one of the bombs near to a @entity74 store where their mother had been sacked for stealing clothes yesterday the brothers ¿ mother , @entity86 , said the @entity8 once told her that @entity9 was ¿ really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him ' despite all this , the @entity8 found no substantive evidence that he was engaged in terror - related activities though they continued to ‘ monitor his internet use and contacts ’			1
according to an intelligence source , @entity13 remained convinced that @entity9 , an ethnic @entity5 , was in ‘ direct contact ’ with @entity118 militants , most likely based in the strife - torn southern @entity13 region of @entity121 , where he lived for two years with his family prior to moving to the @entity82			1
during a six - month visit to @entity13 last year – a trip @entity82 investigators are investigating – it is understood @entity9 visited @entity121 , which is now regarded as more unstable than @entity127			1
one theory is that @entity9 and @entity25 , who was in thrall to his older brother , may have been ‘ inspired ’ by a rebel leader known as @entity13 ’s @entity23			1
@entity22 , like the @entity9 brothers , is an ethnic @entity5 from the war - torn @entity119 that lies between @entity134 and @entity135			1
he has been accused of masterminding some of the worst terrorist atrocities in @entity13 , including suicide bombings carried out by two women on @entity85 ’s metro system in 2010 which killed at least 40			1
significantly , while @entity22 was originally fighting only for @entity5 independence he has more recently embraced a wider jihadist agenda			1
threats : @entity22 has been accused of being behind some of @entity13 's worst terrorist atrocities @entity22 has recently widened his fight for @entity5 independence to a wider @entity147 agenda @entity5 expert dr @entity148 , the founder of @entity150 - based political risk firm @entity151 , explained : ‘ @entity22 has made statements in which he has said that the enemy of @entity154 is not just @entity13 but @entity82 , though the insurgents have never conducted significant operations outside @entity13			1
’ it raises the terrifying prospect of further atrocities being carried out across the globe by disaffected individuals inspired by the jihadist rhetoric of the former @entity5 leaders			1
last night as calls were made for @entity25 to be classified as an ‘ enemy combatant ’ , the brothers ’ uncle , @entity165 , said @entity25 had been ‘ used ’ by his older brother who had fallen under the influence of a @entity82 - based radical of @entity170 descent who ‘ brainwashed ’ him			2
mr @entity165 said that when he met his nephew in 2009 he was troubled by his transformation			0
‘ i was shocked when i heard his words , his phrases			0
he claimed he would just put everything in the will of @entity179			0
it was n’t devotion , it was , as it ’s called , being radicalised			0
’ for many years , though , @entity9 and his younger brother had seemed settled in the @entity82			1
they were popular at school and excelled at sport			0
intriguingly @entity13 president @entity187 offered to ' provide assistance ' to the @entity190 bombing investigation before any link was made to @entity127 settled : @entity9 and @entity25 were popular at school in @entity82 and excelled in sport @entity9 visited war - torn @entity121 , which is now considered even more unstable than @entity127 @entity13 's @entity23 @entity22 was believed to be behind the @entity196 bombing in 2010 which killed at least 40 but it became clear yesterday that it was a series of setbacks in @entity9 ’s personal life that rendered him increasingly bitter			1
individually , none seems particularly significant , but cumulatively they were devastating and caused him to turn against his adopted homeland			0
@entity9 was a promising boxer , possibly destined for the @entity204 , but his dream was shattered by a back injury			1
at the same time he could only manage to secure menial work , though he was considered bright at school			0
he was devastated when his best friend was killed in 2011 in an unsolved murder and then came an incident which investigators believe is particularly significant			0
he was arrested for assaulting his girlfriend in 2009 – which scuppered his chance of obtaining @entity82 citizenship			0
an intelligence source said : ‘ there is a view that this more than anything set him against the @entity82			2
’ [ caption after his trip to @entity13 and @entity121 , @entity9 returned to the @entity82 to discover that his mother had been sacked from @entity225 department store in @entity226 , @entity227 , for allegedly stealing clothes			1
this further enraged him and he became more outspoken in his criticism of @entity82			0
the brothers are believed to have placed one of their bombs near the company ’s @entity74 store , possibly in revenge			2
a @entity85 secret services source indicated yesterday that there had been contact between the two countries during the manhunt , saying that ‘ joint work was organised through partner channels ’			1
intriguingly , president @entity187 offered to ‘ provide assistance ’ to the investigation in @entity74 before it was known that there was a @entity5 link to the bombing			1
‘ fighting terrorism is more important than political posturing , ’ said a @entity13 source yesterday			1
‘ if we work together properly and deeply , we have much more chance of defeating those who want to maim and kill			0
’ last night the brothers ’ parents defended them , as one lay dead and the other critically ill but stable in hospital			0
mr @entity9 said there was nothing suspicious about his son ’s 2012 visit to @entity121			2
‘ he was n’t occupied with anything			0
he was just visiting relatives , ’ he said			0
‘ i knew what he was doing , where he was going			0
‘ i raised my children right , ’ he added			0
‘ this is all lies			0
’ @entity9 is thought to have grown a long beard after returning to @entity74 from his trip to @entity13			1
police believe he shaved it off some weeks ago because he wished to remain inconspicuous as he planned the bombing			0
while denying involvement in any militant form of @entity154 , mr @entity9 confirmed that the family was religious			2
‘ what kind of @entity154 ? in @entity154 we have purity , ’ he said			0
‘ we do what we ’re supposed to			0
we pray five times a day			0
’ and denying that her sons would have hidden any secret extremist leanings from her , his wife said : ‘ that ’s impossible			2
my sons would never keep a secret			0
never ever is this true , my sons are innocent ! ’ mr @entity9 added that he had spoken to @entity296 after the marathon outrage , telling him : ‘ thanks to @entity300 you were not close to there and did not suffer			1
’ he added : ‘ i remember i even asked , “ who could do something like that ? ” ’			0

@entity13 intelligence services warned agency about @entity9
convinced he was in ' direct contact ' with @entity118 militants
may have been inspired by @entity5 rebel leader man known as @entity13 's @entity313 - @entity22
believed to be behind some of @entity13 's worst terrorist atrocities
but @entity8 later discounted @entity9 as a threat , despite telling his mother he was an ' extremist leader '
