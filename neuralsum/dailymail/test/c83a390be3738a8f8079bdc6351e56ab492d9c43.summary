@entity1 legend @entity0 has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown and admitted he was wrong to criticise the @entity3 call up for @entity4			1
the @entity6 winger came off the bench to score the equaliser with a stunning strike in tuesday 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity11 in @entity12			1
it was the perfect riposte after @entity0 said in his @entity15 column : ' if @entity4 can get in ( the @entity3 squad ) then it opens it up for anybody			2
' @entity4 scores @entity3 's equaliser in their 1 - 1 friendly draw with @entity11 in @entity12 on tuesday night @entity4 celebrates his strike with @entity6 team - mates @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 in his column for skysports.com , @entity0 wrote : ' if @entity4 can get in then it opens it up for anybody			1
we are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against @entity34			0
' the @entity3 manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked			0
@entity4 and @entity25 were the worst two players on the pitch			0
' how can you tell me that a manager goes and watches @entity34 against @entity6 , the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes , the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full - back for @entity3 and @entity47 does n't get in the squad ? ' @entity4 later tweeted to his 285,000 followers : ' not bad for a player that should be ' nowhere near the squad ' ay @ @entity54 ? ' and @entity0 insisted on wednesday he was pleased to be proven wrong by the 23 - year - old			1
@entity0 told @entity15 : ' it 's just a matter of opinion , and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at @entity34 in front of @entity61 , so he should n't have been in the squad			2
' but fair play to him , i only give my opinion , and sometimes i 'm wrong , other times i 'm right			0
' when i 'm wrong , i hold my hands up			0
i do n't have a problem with doing that - i 'll always be the first to admit when i 'm wrong			0
' it 's not as though i was watching hoping he would n't score for @entity3 , i 'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him – it was a great goal			2
' but i do n't feel as though i need to defend myself – it 's my job to give my opinion – and i 'm just glad people actually take notice of what i 'm saying !
