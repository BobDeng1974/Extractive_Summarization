by @entity1 reporter published : 12:35 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 20:42 est , 26 july 2012 police are refusing to prosecute a @entity4 immigrant caught on camera stealing scrap metal , because he did n't realise he was committing a crime			1
businessman @entity8 caught the culprit red - handed after fitting @entity9 outside @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 - following a number of raids on the company			1
officers quickly tracked down the thief and he even admitted his actions - but police chiefs decided not to prosecute him , because he claimed taking scrap metal is legal in @entity4			1
@entity21 : @entity8 has been targetted six times by scrap metal thieves mr @entity8 , 37 , is ' gobsmacked ' by the decision			1
he said : ' i ’m not sure how bad a crime has to be where you can claim ignorance before they take action			2
' we ’re so frustrated at what we were told			0
i was gobsmacked and i think the police officer was too			2
' he almost seemed embarrassed			0
is @entity4 law operating in @entity11 ? ' the price of scrap metal has skyrocketed in recent years from £ 80 per skip to between £ 300 and £ 400 per skip			1
mr @entity8 had six skips emptied in the last few months and spent more than £ 500 on 24 - hour cctv surveillance system			0
the company has also spent hundreds of pounds building a large retractable container to protect a skip outside the premises used to store metal off - cuts			2
so when the @entity9 picked up a good shot of the @entity4 man and his vehicle in june they thought they would be able to bring a successful prosecution against him			1
on the first occasion the thief even brought his young daughter with him			0
caught on camera : mr @entity8 caught the thief red - handed on @entity9 , loading the metal into his van the businessman was stunned when the police decided not to prosecute because the thief did n't know he had committed a crime mr @entity8 said : ' the first time he took scrap metal he bought his little girl along			1
' we watched on @entity9 as she ran around looking bored as emptied the skip			2
' but police decided it was not in the ' public interest ' to charge the man , who has not been named			2
sergeant @entity74 said : ' we received two reports of theft from a skip			0
these incidents were fully investigated			0
' a man was arrested and questioned			0
