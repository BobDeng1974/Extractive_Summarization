by @entity0 published : 16:18 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 04:35 est , 28 november 2012 for the royals there is no better way to celebrate a high profile state visit than with @entity6 pomp and ceremony			1
but while most seemed happy to stick to tradition at @entity10 today it appeared not everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet			0
that 's because a glittering military display went slightly awry as one horse decided to throw its rider to the floor as it made an embarrassing run for it			1
it had been organised to kick - off the @entity41 's welcoming of the @entity43 country as part of the leader 's three - day official trip			1
@entity31 was formally welcomed during the somewhat hampered ceremony staged in @entity10 , as @entity6 bids to strengthen its already strong relations with the @entity50 nation			0
rebel : the horse could be seen moving out of position during the precession before it unseated its rider awkward : the rider looks suitably embarrassed after he was thrown off his horse , while others seemed to want to capture it on film professional : he decides there is nothing left to do than make the best of a bad situation and stands at attention @entity41 , @entity68 and @entity69 were present to greet the 83 - year - old @entity71 leader , who is likely to see the visit as both a personal and political highlight of his career			1
handshakes between the @entity6 and @entity32 heads of state were made in the centre of @entity10 near one of the town ’s two stations as well - wishers looked on			2
but the full ceremonial greeting came within historic @entity10 ’s quadrangle where the 1st @entity85 were formed as the guard of honour			0
the royal party arrived at the castle - said to be the @entity41 ’s favourite home - in a carriage procession accompanied by the dazzling sight of a sovereign ’s escort provided by the @entity39 in their breastplates and plumed helmets			1
already waiting was the @entity31 ’s delegation , which included his government ’s finance , foreign and commerce ministers in their flowing robes			0
following tradition @entity68 , dressed in a morning suit , top hat and carrying an umbrella , escorted the @entity71 leader to inspect the guard of honour lined up in two rows in front of the royal party			0
the @entity31 walked past the massed ranks in their bear skins and winter coats and at the end of the line @entity68 gestured towards him to review the soldiers standing in the rear			2
pomp : a ceremonial procession carrying @entity123 , and the @entity41 makes its way through the grounds of @entity10 guard of honour : dozens of troops of the @entity39 arrive on horseback regal : mounted cavalry escort the procession to @entity10 some welcoming party : the @entity41 shakes hands with the @entity134 who is also greeted by @entity68 and prince @entity136 , following his arrival in @entity10 arriving in style : the @entity41 arrived at @entity10 in a carriage with @entity31 , @entity123 ahead of an inspection of the troops greetings : sheik @entity143 , third left , and the @entity41 talk together as she welcomes him to @entity10 visit : the military display was part of a welcoming party from the @entity41 to the @entity134 laughs : the @entity41 and @entity31 share a joke as they walk through the castle 's grounds waiting : a mounted guard of honour are given instructions as to where to stand , but they are not waiting for a bus as the sign suggests , instead they are waiting to meet the @entity41 's procession the @entity41 and @entity136 waited patiently under a small gazebo and watched as the two men rejoined them			1
an impressive procession was then staged for the @entity41 and her guest with the @entity39 and the guard of honour marching past			1
later after a private lunch with senior members of the @entity169 the @entity31 was shown a small exhibition of items from the @entity172 that have a @entity32 theme			0
tradition : the @entity85 march past @entity41 and the @entity175 who was joined from some of the top officials in the @entity71 state senior royals : the @entity134 also met with prince @entity68 and prince @entity136 during the start of his tree day tour good relationship : the pair walk and talk during the visit with @entity68 and @entity136 in toe smart : senior @entity188 including the @entity68 , left , and prince @entity136 turned out to greet the @entity31 line - up : @entity123 stands with members of the @entity6 royal family as he prepares to inspect the troops in the @entity10 grounds followed by the @entity68 , the emir of @entity32 , @entity123 inspects members of the @entity196 friendly : prince @entity68 , the @entity68 and @entity123 talk warmly as they walk together tour : sheik @entity143 , right , and the @entity41 , left , walk into the @entity200 at @entity10 to look at a gold sword that was presented to the @entity41 by @entity32 for her coronation in 1953 gold : the @entity41 shows the @entity31 the sword presented to her by @entity32 to mark her coronation discussion : prime minister sheik @entity207 of @entity32 , left speaks to @entity6 's @entity136 and @entity208 as they view the gold sword in @entity10 's impressive @entity212 drawing room the @entity41 pointed out the objects which included a sword and dagger presented to her grandfather @entity216 in 1919 and another ornate weapon also from @entity32 and a gift to mark the @entity41 's coronation in 1953			1
impressive : dignitaries attend a state banquet on the first day of the @entity32 leader 's state visit to the @entity6 the @entity31 later visited @entity225 military academy which has a tradition of training the ruling classes of @entity228 and is where the @entity229 and prince @entity230 began their military careers			1
this evening , the @entity41 gave a state banquet in the @entity31 's honour at the castle			1
dozens of guests gathered round a extensive table before the @entity41 gave a speech to mark the beginning of the lavish meal			1
in a speech to @entity31 , she praised the ' enduring ties ' between the @entity6 and the @entity32			0
' our relationship runs deep , and the @entity6 is proud to have played its part in @entity32 's recent history , ' the @entity41 said			1
