it has shed two million viewers compared to last year , was beaten into second place in the ratings by @entity5 's @entity4 and rumoured in - fighting between the judges has seen the new look @entity7 plunged into crisis			1
phone votes have plummeted as fans desert the show and it seems @entity14 's huge gamble to leave his signature reality show to launch in the @entity16 , may have put the show in crisis			1
slump : boy band @entity19 were voted off last night 's @entity7 live show which saw viewing figures and phone votes plummet despite gaining 9.6 million viewers during saturday 's live shows , @entity7 was beaten in the ratings by the @entity5 's @entity4 , which had 9.75million tuning in despite its barely revamped format			1
sunday night 's results show rose to 11.4million viewers but compared to 13.4million for the same stage of the competition last year , it 's clear that the new format is not quite yielding the much - hoped for results			1
and today , @entity35 is expected to discover that phone votes for the first public eviction have also plummeted as newspaper reports today suggest that viewers have lost faith with the acts , which would mean a major drop in income for @entity35 and producers			1
but despite the falling ratings , a drop in phone votes and reports of unrest behind the scenes , an upbeat @entity14 insists he is very happy with the way the show is going			1
a source told @entity54 : ' @entity14 's really happy with the show here in the @entity57			1
he has deliberately left the @entity57 show to run without him and he absolutely trusts the team to do a great job			2
happy : @entity14 , seen here on the @entity63 last night , is pleased with how the @entity57 show is going - and is said to have already spotted an act that he believes is a ' stand out star ' by @entity66 say what you like about @entity14 - and i have often - but he knows how to put together a talent show that draws in the viewers			1
true , @entity72 has always been about as reflective of the vibrancy of the @entity57 music scene as @entity75 is of @entity77 tv drama , but it 's always been entertaining and slick			2
without the book - haired @entity14 at the helm , however , it 's falling apart			1
@entity81 , whose knowledge about pop music would fit comfortably on a grain of rice , is demonstrably out of his depth without his old mucker @entity14 to guide him across the musical road , while @entity89 has been anonymous and @entity90 domineering and annoying			1
but it 's @entity92 who 's been the biggest disappointment			2
what 's with that beard ? he 's obviously going for the @entity99 look but he just ends looking like one of the @entity101			0
with his droopy eyes and			0
he 's clearly trying to project gravitas but instead he looks as though he 's trying to remember where he left the keys to his combine harvester			0
oh , and the acts			0
@entity19 's cover of @entity111 's @entity109 was like watching kittens singing @entity113 - compelling , undoubtedly , but for all the wrong reasons			0
the styling has n't been much better			0
i 've not seen since awful , mismatched outfits since the @entity118			0
this farrago would never have happened under @entity14 's watch			2
but with the @entity16 x factor suffering too can he really spare the time to save his original money - spinner ? ' @entity14 is very happy with how they are all doing and thinks all the judges are doing a fantastic job too			1
not only that , @entity14 has already spotted an act on the show who he thinks is a clear standout star			1
' saturday night â€™s programme was watched by an average of 10.1million people , compared with 12million in the corresponding episode of the previous series			0
in contrast , its @entity5 rival , @entity4 beat the @entity7 for all but five minutes of the half - hour period when the two programmes overlapped			0
it also had a larger audience share			0
fans of the show also took to their social networking pages in droves last night during the sing - off between the bottom two acts , boy band @entity19 and @entity148 , slamming their ' tuneless ' performances			2
but according to reports today , it 's not just the falling ratings and phone votes that have hit the show , but unrest behind the scenes , with judge @entity90 at the centre of the reports			1
according to the @entity161 , the @entity160 star , 30 , has been throwing her weight around and bossing fellow judge @entity89 and telling @entity81 's acts to ditch his ideas			0
an insider claimed that instead of focusing on her own acts , the girls , she has been meddling with the other acts			0
speaking to the paper , they said : ' @entity90 is trying to turn this into @entity172 with her meddling - and it 's really putting people 's noses out of joint			0
' the contestants love it as they 're in awe of her but the judges hate it			2
@entity89 has properly fallen out with her after @entity90 went to speak to her about the styling and songs and vocals for @entity187			0
' doing a great job : @entity14 is pleased with the line - up of judges this year which include regular @entity81 and newcomers @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity92 safe : @entity148 made it through to next week 's show after the sing - off with @entity19 but was slammed on social networking sites for his ' tuneless ' performance the paper also claimed that @entity89 felt the force of the producers ' wrath after arriving for rehearsals looking hungover and exhausted , having spent the night before cheering on her axed act @entity204 who performed at @entity207 club @entity206 , and who @entity89 surprised with a birthday cake for her 17th			1
a source said : ' she looked a wreck and spent most of the time just sitting behind the judging desk with her head slumped on it			0
' clash : reports have claimed that @entity90 has put @entity89 's nose out of joint by bossing her about and telling her what to do with her acts hungover : sources also claimed that @entity89 was ticked off for arriving for rehearsals looking worse for wear after a late night supporting her axed act @entity227 at a performance at @entity206			2
