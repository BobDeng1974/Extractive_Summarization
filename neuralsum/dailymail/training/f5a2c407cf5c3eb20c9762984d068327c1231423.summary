@entity1 , who has not played for his club since august 31 , 11 matches ago , damaged his calf two weeks ago in training as he was working his way back from a thigh injury			1
@entity0 has confirmed @entity1 will miss @entity2 's match against @entity7 @entity1 picked up his latest injury on @entity24 duty and has n't played since the beginning of september @entity1 went on @entity26 on thursday to reveal he his feeling ' closer to full fitness ' crunch matches he will miss @entity7 ( a ) - november 1 @entity11 ( a ) - november 4 @entity13 ( h ) - november 8 @entity24 vs @entity32 - november 12 @entity33 v @entity24 - november 15 @entity2 initially hoped he might recover within a fortnight but there is no prospect of that and @entity0 has reluctantly accepted that time has run out			1
‘ i do n’t think he will be fit , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ the bottom line is that he is injured			2
we will just wait and work with him until he gets back fit			2
‘ i have to find the solutions without @entity1			2
you are learning every day about the players			0
gradually as each day goes by , i sense and feel we are getting better			0
’ the ramifications of @entity1 ’s absence from those matches is that he will not be available for @entity24 ’s games against @entity32 and @entity33 next month , either			1
the @entity24 striker tweeted that he is getting ' closer to fitness each day ' but will be out of a crucial week @entity1 signs autographs before @entity2 's @entity55 game against @entity56 on tuesday his absence has come as a source of great frustration to his manager , as the 25 - year - old ’s pace , clinical finishing and dynamism are crucial to @entity2 ’s gameplan and they have certainly missed him			1
@entity0 would not be drawn on @entity1 ’s claim on @entity66 that his fitness problems might be ‘ hereditary ’ as both his father ( @entity69 ) and uncle ( @entity71 ) endured muscular injuries like him , but the manager wants to see his striker have a consistent run in his team			1

@entity0 would not be drawn on @entity1 's claims that his fitness problems might be ' hereditary ' ‘ we will work with him and hopefully we will get that bit of luck when he comes back			2
when he comes back , hopefully we will have him for the rest of the season			0
‘ i can only concentrate on his injury now			0
he ’s just recovering and we will see the length of time it takes			0
he is probably speaking how he felt			0
that is the way of the world			0
‘ i am not an expert on any genetics code , or medicine , so i ca n’t comment			0
