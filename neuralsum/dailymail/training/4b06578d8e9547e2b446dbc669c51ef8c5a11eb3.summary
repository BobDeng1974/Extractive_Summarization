by @entity0 there have been so many questions from readers about how to disguise pigmentation , redness and fine lines , that this week i ’m looking at make - up that hides those annoying signs of ageing			1
this month brings new savvy products , including complexion - perfecting creams , to tackle these issues			1
@entity15 ’s @entity14 ( £ 34 , @entity16 ) , gives great coverage to fine lines , redness , pigmentation and other imperfections , and is available in 20 shades			1
new look : @entity22 , 59 , loved how young her makeover made her looks @entity25 ( £ 9.99 , @entity26 ) is non-greasy and comes in green to counteract redness , violet to brighten dull skin and peach to wake up tired skin			1
and @entity34 ’s @entity33 ( out february 13 , £ 18 , avonshop.co.uk ) can be used before or after foundation and patted over make - up during the day when you need a retouch			1
it feels like a balm , but turns to powder on your skin			2
i can also tell you about @entity43 , which launches today			2
its smart , slim palettes and pencils deal with age - related issues			1
it offers workshops with make - up artists so you can learn how to use colour correctors , highlight like a professional and so on			1
make - up artists will also come to your home so you and a group of friends can learn together			1
@entity22 , 59 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , tried one of these sessions for me			2
international make - up artist @entity61 showed her how to disguise enlarged pores and fine lines , cover age spots and lessen redness , and the tricks of clever contouring and highlighting			1
he used the @entity69 ( £ 32 ) , which includes a primer , colour correctors and two concealers			1
after applying primer to smooth fine lines , @entity61 used green colour corrector to tone down redness and creamy concealer to hide pigmentation			2
‘ use a dark , matte shade on areas you want to recede and absorb light , and a highlighter to lift and bring features forward , ’ he says			2
‘ when contouring , use a completely matte product , otherwise it wo n’t look natural			2
‘ start to contour with the darker shade in the hollow of the cheek , below the apple , and blend towards the hairline			0
next , create balance by applying the product to the hollows of the temples and forehead			0
‘ then , apply highlighter on top of the cheekbones , following the natural contour , and down to the lower cheek			0
‘ finish off with the other areas that naturally catch light — the forehead , bridge of the nose , chin and upper lip			0
‘ finally , use blusher to add youthful flush			0
’ so what did @entity22 think ? ‘ it makes me feel the way i used to when i felt good about myself , ’ she says			0
exfoliate : @entity113 @entity115 it better @entity117 ’s @entity116 is formulated with bamboo and pumice extracts for a gentle exfoliation			0
unlike the usual salt and sugar scrubs , these natural exfoliates do not dissolve in water , but ‘ stick ’ to the skin for a quicker , easier and more effective treatment			0
therapists at the @entity129 - based spa advise applying the scrub to damp skin in circular movements , paying particular attention to dry areas such as the knees and elbows , before rinsing off			1
this should be done once or twice a week			0
for best results , follow with a generous application of the brand ’s @entity113			0
the scrub ( £ 6.50 for 200ml ) and body butter ( £ 8.50 for 200ml ) are available exclusively at @entity143 , instore or at @entity144			1
feed your hair nourish : @entity149 's @entity148 @entity149 ’s @entity150 has long been a celebrity favourite			0

the newest addition is @entity148 , ( £ 11.50 , @entity160 ) , a thick and nourishing hair mask to help undo all the damage wrought by heat styling , frequent shampooing and products			1
with shea butter and organic oat extracts , it can be used as a 20 - minute mask , with hair wrapped in a towel , as an overnight treatment or before shampooing			1
it does n’t weigh down your hair as long as you wash it out thoroughly			0
the rest of the range , including shampoo , starts at £ 8.95			1
@entity180 @entity181 : @entity182 a quick fix for puffy eyes is always welcome			0

@entity192 colour : @entity194 and @entity195 the new @entity194 and @entity195 ( £ 6.99 , @entity196 ) is slimmer than a @entity197 , but fatter than a lipliner			1
the five bright shades are rich and creamy with amazing staying power			0
for lips , build up the colour by blotting after the first application and reapplying			0
gently blend with your fingertips onto the apples of the cheeks for a flush of colour			0
@entity211 dramatic : too faced @entity213 do n't listen to those who say that black mascara is too harsh for mature women to wear			0
if you ’re looking for one that really packs a punch , @entity217 ’ new @entity213 ( £ 19 ) might be what you are looking for			2
you need only one coat to create intensely black @entity225 dramatic sooty lashes are your thing , try @entity228 ’s @entity227 ( £ 7.99 , @entity26 )			2
