by @entity0 and @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 straddling a powerful motorbike in his leathers , this is the first picture of the @entity9 policeman named as a suspect in the brutal murder of a former @entity13 model and friend of @entity15 at the remote animal sanctuary she ran			1
the family of @entity18 gave the name of officer @entity20 to her @entity22 inquest – claiming he had threatened to have her ‘ eliminated ’ – and told how he had once attacked the animal lover before beating her daughter so badly she feared she would die			1
but on sunday the shaven - headed 47 - year - old former officer dismissed the dead @entity27 ’s family and their allegations , declaring : ‘ @entity18 ’s sister is just a mean b * * * * , so is her daughter			1
’ suspect : @entity3 ex-policeman @entity20 , pictured , denies murdering @entity18 at the remote animal sanctuary she ran in @entity32 , north - west @entity3 , despite claims from her family in chilling evidence to @entity39 coroner dr @entity38 , members of @entity18 ’s family alleged they believed @entity20 was linked to both the death of the 65 - year - old and an extensive cover - up of the killing at the sanctuary in @entity32 , north - west @entity3 , where her body was dismembered and set ablaze in september 2008			1
speaking for the first time yesterday , there was only contempt from @entity20 for @entity49 and her family , mocking them by suggesting the sanctuary – partly funded by donations from the @entity13 and money given by @entity15 ’s widow @entity55 – had been used to run drugs and guns hidden inside dogs			1
‘ of course i did n’t kill her , ’ he said dismissively			0
‘ i was representing the law			0
i can not be linked to her death			0
celebrity : animal lover @entity18 , left , was murdered in @entity3 in 2008 , and found fame in the 1960s as a model and socialite			1
an inquest into her death held in @entity22 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing ‘ the only reason this case has n’t died off yet is because she was @entity73			1
’ he pointed out that @entity75 , 33 , who worked at the sanctuary , had confessed and been sentenced to 13 years behind bars for the killing			1
recording a verdict of unlawful killing , dr @entity38 had said that while she was satisfied @entity75 was ‘ at least partly responsible ’ , inconsistencies in evidence supported the belief that ‘ others might have been involved ’			1
this belief is strongly held by @entity18 ’s sister @entity86 – a @entity88 peace prize winner ¬ – and daughter @entity86			1
@entity18 pictured in @entity90 ( left )			2
the 65 - year - old disappeared in september 2008 from her home in @entity2 , near @entity93 in @entity3			1
caretaker @entity75 admitted killing the former model and socialite inquest : @entity18 ' daughter @entity86 ( left ) and @entity18 's sister @entity86 ( right ) at @entity100 during the inquest the family has called on @entity103 to be allowed to investigate the death after the inquest heard of a disturbing conflict in the evidence of investigators opening the way for @entity20 to be potentially questioned by @entity13 officers			1
@entity20 insisted : ‘ i ’m also sure that when the authorities want to hear my side of the story i will be properly notified			2
but until then i can not take these accusations seriously			0
’ the inquest was told that @entity20 had never been questioned about the killing and had even taken part in the police investigation			1
but he stressed : ‘ i have been questioned about this @entity18 case so many times and i have had enough of it			2
i just want to leave it behind me			0
’ he accused mrs @entity18 of using her animal sanctuary as a cover to ‘ smuggle drugs and guns ’ into @entity3 from @entity127			1
friendship : @entity18 became friends @entity15 and @entity55 , whose cash eventually helped pay for her animal sanctuary beauty : ms @entity18 was a successful model and actress before moving to @entity3 to look after animals he claimed : ‘ i filed reports about @entity18 ’s suspicious activities but my superiors did not let me investigate properly			1
‘ she was collecting large dogs from the west to rehabilitate them after they were neutered , she claimed , but there was no rehabilitation			0
‘ instead she burned the dogs at dawn			0
‘ how mysterious , they always ended up dying			0
i was never allowed to investigate			2
‘ what was she hiding inside the dogs – drugs , guns ? ’ he said mrs @entity18 had refused to let him search her car			2
the cats and dogs sanctuary was funded partly by donations from animal lovers in @entity73 and a gift from @entity55 horrific crime : ms @entity18 was murdered at her animal sanctuary in september 2008 near @entity2 , 65 - miles from @entity93			1
her body was dismembered and burnt ‘ i stopped @entity18 in the middle of the night on a back road			2
she had been driving without her headlights on			0
there were empty champagne bottles in the car and some big dogs with her			0
‘ i wanted to see the dogs , whether they were alive , but instead of opening the car , she just drove off			0
i had to jump out of the way so i was n’t run over			0
again , i was not allowed to investigate			2
‘ i ’m sure there is a whole lot more to this story than what has been made public			0
but i do not want to get involved with the case ever again			0
’ @entity20 left the police when investigations into the death were on - going – the family claim he was ‘ pensioned off ’ – and he went to live in @entity182 , a dust - blown country village off the main truck road to @entity185 , near the town of @entity32			1
star : @entity18 being chased by the press in @entity22 at the height of her fame in the 1960s following the break - up of his marriage , he moved to neighbouring @entity195 where he set up home with his girlfriend in one of the many @entity3 - speaking villages on the north side of the river @entity203			1
the pair worked together in a hotel			0
while he was happy to taunt those closest to mrs @entity18 , he said nothing about his attack on the grandmother and ms @entity86 – or the court ruling against him and legal wrangling that was on - going at the time of the murder in connection with the assaults			2
ms @entity86 , from @entity217 , west @entity22 , told the inquest how the policeman had been responsible for a ‘ @entity223 ’ style attack on her and her mother at the sanctuary in 2002			1
crime : caretaker @entity75 admitted killing mrs @entity18 and setting fire to her body , but her daughter @entity86 believes that the @entity3 authorities covered up the investigation to protect a local officer a dispute over a rescue dog had grown , she said , so that at one point the officer had attacked her mother in the courtyard and then turned on ms @entity86 when she tried to photograph the assault			1
she said her head was ‘ smashed ’ against the wall and @entity20 then hit her repeatedly with his baton			2
' i crumpled into a heap and he began raining blows on me with his baton - an @entity245 baton designed to break bones , ’ she said			0
' i turned my head and looked at his face and his eyes were that of somebody taking great pleasure in what he was doing			0
‘ i thought i was going to die			0
’ eventually , mrs @entity18 calmed him , she recalled , but not before he had ‘ crushed like a pancake ’ a grey kitten with his foot that had been beside her head			2
’ the remains of @entity18 was found in woods near her home ( pictured ) it was this incident and his subsequent ‘ humiliation ’ in court , the family believes , that lead to an on - going feud which ended in death			1
last night a furious ms @entity86 hit back at @entity20 calling his comments ‘ cruel and outrageous			2
’ ‘ it shows the quality of this man that he would say such things about the dead , about a woman who was murdered , butchered and burned on his patch , the very patch he was meant to police			0
‘ like others in authority in @entity3 , he has questions to answer – he had damned himself , what more does he need to do to the memory of a dead woman , whose only crime was to love animals and be prepared to stand - up to him ? ‘ with the evidence of the inquest and now these words , surely @entity3 and prime minister @entity286 , who was in @entity22 last week given a speech on @entity289 , ca n’t continue to refuse @entity103 and foreign secretary @entity291 ’s call for all documents relating to the case to be handed over to @entity13			1
’ she added : ‘ @entity103 must be called in			0
the longer they delay , the more people will ask what @entity3 is hiding			0
’ mrs @entity18 , attracted the attention and friendship of @entity15 and @entity55 in the 1960s when the famous couple were looking to cast an actress in a film project .			0
