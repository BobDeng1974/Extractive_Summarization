@entity0 coasted to a six - try , 49 - 7 victory over @entity2 in a @entity4 clash marred by an unpunished stamp to debutant @entity6 's face			1
the hosts were left incensed by flanker @entity9 bringing his boot down on back - rower @entity6 's face but captain @entity13 's complaints went unheeded by referee @entity14			1
@entity6 somehow escaped serious injury in a scrappy first - half , before @entity17 claimed a brace while @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 all crossed , with @entity23 responding for @entity2			1
@entity24 fly half @entity25 impressed for @entity0 with his attacking play and accurate goal kicking @entity0 hooker @entity20 barges over for his team 's second try as the @entity30 began to tire @entity21 scorches over for @entity0 's third as the rampant @entity32 begin to overwhelm the visitors @entity24 scrum - half @entity13 was waved away despite telling referee @entity14 ' i have a very serious question ' after @entity6 received the boot to the face			1
@entity14 responded by claiming ' i ca n't listen to that , ' effectively rejecting @entity13 's request for a @entity42 ( @entity43 ) review			0
referee @entity44 called for a review following a request from @entity48 captain @entity47 that led to the @entity48 ' decisive penalty in 27 - 25 victory over the @entity51 last month			0
@entity53 and @entity0 full back @entity17 dives over for the first of his two tries in @entity4 here though , @entity14 was unmoved , but @entity9 can expect to be cited for his reckless , if unintentional act			1
@entity0 will learn little from their routine victory in truth , with boss @entity60 having made 13 changes from the side that saw off @entity48 29 - 15 a week earlier			0
@entity60 's men host @entity64 next weekend , with a raft of senior stars all expected to return			0
the hosts wasted a number of clear - cut chances in a try-less first - half , with @entity2 dominating early set - piece exchanges			2
@entity25 is well tackled as @entity0 winger @entity21 looks to support the @entity32 fly half @entity53 prop @entity19 bursts through the @entity2 defence early in the first half in @entity4 @entity17 claims a high ball under pressure from @entity2 forward @entity77 full - back @entity78 dragged an early shot at goal wide for the visitors , before @entity25 posted three penalties amid @entity0 wasting plenty of territory and possession			1
@entity60 's men should have scored following @entity19 's fine galloping break , and also when @entity88 linked well with @entity13 and @entity6			2
@entity89 spilled @entity88 's wide pass to leave another chance begging , and @entity0 turned around 9 - 0 to the good with @entity2 scrum - half @entity92 in the sin - bin for killing the ball			2
@entity0 quickly broke their try duck after the restart , @entity19 driving home for his first test score			0
@entity53 speedster @entity21 ( left ) is well tackled by @entity2 openside @entity9 @entity2 lock @entity23 dives over for his team 's only try at the @entity103 @entity60 's side racked up three more wasted chances to add to first - half frustrations , before @entity20 capped a regulation driving maul to double the try count			1
the usual raft of replacements brought @entity111 into the fray , with @entity113 withdrawn as @entity0 eyed next week 's @entity64 clash			0
@entity115 's @entity111 threw a forward pass then conceded a quick penalty in an inauspicious arrival , allowing @entity2 a foothold			0
then from a penalty lineout lock @entity23 ghosted through flimsy defence to claim a try for the visitors			1
@entity0 flanker @entity124 makes a strong carry into the @entity2 defence @entity129 and @entity0 centre @entity127 tries to fend off @entity2 's @entity130 @entity21 ran in @entity0 's third score after a scrum deep in @entity2 's 22 , following a yellow card for number eight @entity77			1
@entity135 took a heavy bang to the head in the build - up to @entity21 's try , receiving lengthy on - field treatment before being removed via stretcher			0
@entity17 finished a smart @entity0 move next , before capping a field - length break launched by a smart turnover from debutant replacement @entity144			0
replacement centre @entity22 then glossed the scoreline still further late on as @entity60 's men completed their routine and expected victory			2
while @entity0 negotiated this clash simply enough , @entity60 and friends know full well a challenge of an entirely different calibre awaits next weekend .			0

tries from @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity17 ( two ) and @entity22 secure victory at the @entity103
