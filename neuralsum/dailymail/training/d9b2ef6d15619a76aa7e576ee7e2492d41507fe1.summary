the @entity1 's top communications official plotted to squash a reporter who aggressively covered the agency 's ill - fated @entity5 gun scandal in 2011 , previously secret emails show			1
the emails , between the @entity1 's then - communications chief @entity7 and @entity10 press flack @entity8 , are a rare look inside the @entity15 administration 's press control machine			1
they were released thursday while the nation was preoccupied with president @entity15 's immigration policy announcement , as the result of a long - languishing @entity21 lawsuit filed by the center - right watchdog group @entity22			1
in one message , @entity7 told @entity24 that @entity26 journalist @entity25 needed to be reined in , writing that she was ' calling @entity27 's [ sic ] editor and reaching out to @entity29			1
she 's out of control			0
' targeted : the @entity1 tried to rein in award - winning television journalist @entity25 after she reported critically on the @entity5 gun scandal attorney general @entity32 told @entity33 in 2011 that he had only learned of the deadly gun ' walking ' program ' for the first time over the last few weeks , ' but @entity25 published documents that proved otherwise @entity38 refers to @entity26 news anchor @entity38 , a journalist who has enjoyed a chummy relationship with the @entity15 @entity10			1
he interviewed the president two weeks ago in a rare on - camera appearance			0
@entity7 hatched her plan a day after @entity25 reported on documents showing attorney general @entity32 was sent briefings on the @entity5 operation beginning in 2010			1
that directly contradicted his sworn statements to @entity33			0
in may 2011 @entity32 told a @entity49 panel that ' i 'm not sure of the exact date , but i probably heard about @entity5 for the first time over the last few weeks			0
' the @entity52 later held @entity32 in criminal @entity53 for failing to turn over subpoenaed documents related to the scandal			0
in her emails , @entity7 told @entity24 that she had ' i spent much of last night explaining to everyone it 's a bulls * * t accusation			1
' @entity25 , who left @entity26 a year ago over concerns that the network was reflexively killing stories that were critical of the administration , told @entity65 that the federal government 's backroom plotting was in line with what she experienced previously			1
' this is just the tip of the iceberg			0
... now people have a black and white email from the perpetrators to see for themselves what i 've long known , ' she said			0
@entity5 was a program that the involved @entity79 – a subagency of the @entity1 – encouraging gun dealers to knowingly sell weapons to ' straw buyers ' who intended to traffick them across the @entity86 border			1
fighting back : @entity25 spills the beans in a new book about how the government impedes the work of reporters the administration intended to track the guns , hopefully to @entity86 drug cartels , but lost control of two - thirds of the 2,000 firearms involved			1
one was the weapon that killed a @entity102 @entity101 agent , and others were tied to hundreds of deaths of @entity86 nationals			0
' think about the outrage , ' @entity25 said friday			0
' they are angry not that @entity109 employees embarked upon an ill - advised cross-border operation to arm @entity86 drug cartels , or that the attorney general provided conflicting testimony before @entity33 : they 're mad that i did my job and reported on it			2
' the @entity1 was at one point forced to retract testimony that denied the government was knowingly ' walking ' guns into @entity86			2
' also , it appears to be wholly inappropriate use of presidential executive privilege , ' she said , referring to the @entity10 's years - long delay in releasing the trove of emails			1
' there is nothing in this email that legally justifies why the president would have invoked executive privilege to keep it secret from the public and @entity33 all this time until forced by a lawsuit to turn it over			0
' @entity24 did not respond to a request for comment			0
@entity7 could not be reached friday			0
the emails also include an indication that the @entity1 provided leaked documents to a @entity140 reporter in order to counter @entity25 's reporting			1
' i sent @entity145 's @entity144 your way , ' @entity7 told @entity24			2
' she 's writing on [ rep. @entity148 ] @entity149 and i said you could load her up on the leaks , etc. ' @entity151 , the hard - charging @entity152 chairman from @entity153 , was the most aggressive pit bull chasing the scandal in @entity33 at the time			2
@entity24 seemed disappointed that @entity157 was the only high - profile journalist to write a follow - up story that took the administration 's side			2
' why do you think nobody else wrote ? ' he asked			0
' were they not fed the docs ? ' @entity165 ? @entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) discussed frankly how to supply some reporters with documents while they tried to restrain others @entity24 was later promoted within the administration and now holds the position of principal deputy press secretary , briefing reporters at the @entity10 and aboard @entity173 when press secretary @entity174 is unavailable			1
@entity25 's book , ' stonewalled , ' chronicles her experiences			2
@entity22 president @entity177 said in a statement that the tranche of emails released thursday ' are a road map to the @entity15 administration ’s @entity5 cover - up and deadly lies			2
' he told @entity65 on friday that ' it is disturbing to see top officials at the @entity15 @entity10 and @entity1 targeting a journalist for destruction because she dared published the truth			1
' ' i wonder : just how big is @entity15 enemies list ? ' ' president @entity15 ’s dishonest assertion of executive privilege over this material would have embarrassed @entity197 , ' he said			0
' she 's @entity199 uploaded by @entity65			0
