by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 03:05 est , 5 march 2013 still active : @entity1 of @entity2 did not let her pregnancy slow her down when she went sledging in @entity4 halfway down a black run , high above the @entity8 resort of @entity9 , i stop to consider my options			1
this is , after all , no ordinary black run			1
it is @entity13 — the men ’s 2009 @entity14 downhill course — and the next bit of it , the one i am about to attempt to ski , is so steep , so sheer , it is terrifying			1
under normal circumstances , i would n’t hesitate			1
but i am four months pregnant and — standing there on the lip of this heart - stopping vertical drop — i pay a momentary thought to my growing baby , obliviously cocooned in my womb , and have a sudden wobble of conscience			1
so do i take the sensible route , remove my skis and call for help ? not on your life			1
call me reckless , but what i do instead is take a deep breath and go for it — all the way to the bottom , where i head to the nearest bar for a brandy to steady my nerves			1
even today , that memory does make me cringe a little			1
but the baby i was carrying is now a healthy , thrill - seeking 12 - year - old girl who seems hell - bent on pushing her own boundaries of fear at every turn			1
of course , i was n’t carrying a future heir to the throne like the @entity54 , nor was this my first baby — both understandable reasons for @entity54 to play it safe last weekend when , on the slopes of the luxury @entity60 resort in @entity4 , she decided to give skiing with the rest of the royal party a miss. she was there — along with princes @entity66 and @entity67 — for the wedding of polo player @entity69 and @entity14 dressage champion @entity70			2
and while everyone else headed straight for the slopes , the @entity1 — herself a keen skier — chose to opt for the ‘ safer ’ pursuit of an afternoon ’s sledging instead			1
but her choice of recreation still attracted criticism			2
one onlooker said : ‘ she tucked her legs up and just went			2
i thought it was very brave for a pregnant woman because it was on quite an incline			2
’ @entity87 baby : @entity1 enjoyed walks around the luxury ski resort of @entity60 while @entity66 and prince @entity67 went skiing almost as soon as the pictures of the @entity1 , sledge in hand , were published , the reaction was instant			1
people damned her for being cavalier with her safety and that of her unborn baby			2
sledging , as anyone who ’s ever done it will know , can be a bit hair - raising			2
after all , nearly everyone falls off			2
you can see why more cautious types would steer well clear — especially when pregnant			2
after my skiing exploits , though , sledging sounds pretty tame to me			2
but , of course , the pregnancy police would probably much prefer that the @entity1 had stayed inside , rug over knees , with a hot chocolate and had no fun at all			1
but , as i know from four pregnancies , there is little point in wrapping yourself in cotton wool for nine months			2
it just makes the whole , drawn - out process of being pregnant even more boring than it already is			2
indeed , not only did i ski while carrying all of my babies ( although i did , eventually , steer clear of black runs ) , i also cycled , ice - skated , roller - bladed , went on a 42ft - high zip wire across a lake , jet - skied , jogged , flew across the world and — shock horror — rode on the back of a motorbike			2
it may sound as if i specifically hunted out hedonistic pursuits in a bid to liven up being pregnant			0
but this could n’t be further from the truth			0
i just refused to put my life on hold and morph into one of those dreadful expectant mothers who have to let the world know they are carrying precious cargo , placing stickers on their car saying things like : ‘ mum - to - be woman on board			0
’ i ’m not alone , either			0
when she was five months pregnant , marathon champion @entity147 admitted running 14 miles a day in training			0
which just goes to show that women need not — and in most cases should not — take pregnancy sitting down			1
on the contrary , the benefit of exercise is undisputed			0
it not only makes for an easier labour and delivery , but can also help prevent excessive weight gain , which reduces the risk of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia ( pregnancy - induced high blood pressure ) which is a leading cause of illness and death in mothers and babies			1
of course , there ’s a big difference between staying healthy through pregnancy and putting yourself and your unborn foetus in unnecessary danger			1
but where do you draw the line ? a survey for the baby charity @entity178 and healthcare company @entity180 found that 45 per cent of expectant women have been left confused by conflicting information they have received about pregnancy			1
baby bump : @entity186 with her bump clearly on display as she talked to @entity67 at the wedding of @entity70 and polo player @entity190 in @entity60 there are virtually as many opinions on what ’s safe in pregnancy as there are people to give them			1
i admit i probably pushed the boundaries more than most when pregnant with @entity199 , 14 , @entity200 , 12 , @entity201 , ten , and @entity202 , three			0
certainly , that moment at the top of the mountain is probably pretty exceptional for a pregnant woman			0
but something my mother said to me early in my first pregnancy has stuck with me ever since			1
future parents : prince @entity66 with the @entity54 on their holiday to @entity4 before the arrival of their baby in the summer ‘ do n’t treat growing a baby like an illness , ’ she advised			1
‘ just get on with your life as normal			0
it ’s a far healthier approach			0
’ and she was right			0
on that basis , i drank a glass or two of wine every night once morning sickness had worn off			0
my gp even told me that @entity227 was better for the foetus than me being stressed , which seemed to make perfectly good sense to me			0
on holiday , i ignored recommendations that pregnant women should not eat raw shellfish , soft cheeses and pate — because of the risk of harmful bacteria , and food poisoning such as listeria — and indulged in prawns , cheese platters and even , on one occasion , foie gras			1
i did n’t do that again — not because it made me ill , but it gave me terrible heartburn			0
not only did i have happier pregnancies because of this relaxed , non-neurotic approach — but i also believe it set the pattern for my entire attitude towards motherhood afterwards			0
my body may have been hijacked by a being that had n’t even entered the world yet , but — from the moment of conception — i flatly refused to have my personality hijacked , too			0
and that did n’t change once they were born			0
today , i have four healthy , thriving children — despite my adrenaline - fuelled , @entity265 - consuming pregnancies			0
but i ’m still recognisably ‘ me ’ , too , and hopefully that will never be compromised			0
i sincerely hope the @entity54 continues to enjoy a trouble - free pregnancy			1
but i also hope she does n’t get so bogged down with worry that she forgets how to enjoy herself			0
my advice would be to ignore the pregnancy police and do what feels right			1
and if that means whizzing down a hill on a wooden toboggan — or even skiing — then she should go for it and enjoy every moment			0
i ’m sure the newest heir to the throne would understand			0
after all , who wants a boring mother ?			0

@entity1 of @entity2 was criticised for being too active on holiday
our *writer* insists it is beneficial to keep on exercising through pregnancy
