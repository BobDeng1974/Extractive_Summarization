by @entity0 published : 00:37 est , 30 june 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 30 june 2013 we 've all seen the photos and images of @entity4 taken from space while space stations orbit our home planet			2
but one perspective no human has seen if the view orbiting @entity11 - our neighbor red planet			0
now , thanks to satellite imaging taken by the @entity19 's @entity18 probe you can actually experience what it would be like to orbit the planet			1
the @entity18 satellite was launched in 2003 and started taking data on the planet in early 2004			1
the main goal of the mission was to figure out if there is or was ever any water on the planet			0
originally the structure had two parts , the satellite and a lander called the @entity47			1
@entity47 was supposed to land on the planet on december 25 , 2003 but failed			0
it was n't too much of a surprise though , since nearly half of all landing attempts have failed			0
the satellite side of the project however , has been quite successful and earned five extensions , the most recent going until 2014			1
according to measurements taken last year , the satellite has enough fuel to last another 13 years in space .			2

@entity61 was created with satellite imaging taken from by a @entity19 probe
