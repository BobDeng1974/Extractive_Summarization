@entity0 has spoken of the incredible weekend that saw him inspire @entity3 's youth team to glory in the @entity5 either side of a call - up to @entity9 's first - team squad			1
the @entity10 ' under 19 captain played the full 90 minutes of @entity3 's 4 - 0 semi-final win over @entity13 in @entity14 on friday afternoon after learning that @entity9 wanted him on the bench for the @entity18 clash at @entity19 on sunday			1

@entity0 has spoken of the incredible weekend after @entity3 won the @entity5 on monday @entity0 was on the bench for @entity3 seniors for the @entity18 clash at @entity19 on sunday but just a few hours later he was out in @entity31 scoring twice and captaining his side in becoming champions and clearly untroubled by the ' commuting ' , the 18 - year - old scored twice in the 3 - 2 final win over @entity36 as @entity3 became the first @entity38 team to lift the @entity5 trophy			1
after the triumph in @entity31 , @entity0 told @entity41 : ' i got a phone call at @entity44 ( on friday ) and i was told i had to come back to @entity45 because the first team needed me on the bench			2
' so i was a bit shocked because i wanted to play the final and i did n't know whether i 'd get back or not			0
it 's been a bit of a rush but i 'm glad i was here and also glad i was on the bench			0
' @entity0 's close - range finish gave @entity3 a seventh - minute lead against @entity36 in the final			1
although the @entity58 were gifted an equaliser when defender @entity60 put through his own net , @entity3 took command after the break			0
@entity64 ( left ) and @entity0 got the goals as @entity3 saw off @entity36 to take the trophy first , @entity64 headed in a @entity68 cross to restore their lead and then @entity0 made sure of victory with a well - taken left - foot finish a few minutes later			1
@entity0 then had the honour of lifting the @entity74 trophy as @entity3 followed in the footsteps of @entity76 last year			2
he added : ' it is an amazing achievement , we 've come so far since the first game against @entity80			2

he said : ' it 's a great tournament , i managed to do quite well			0
i finished as top goalscorer , which is an amazing achievement for me			2
' obviously playing against all these different teams in @entity98 , i 've got to adapt to how they play and i think i 'm scoring a lot of goals in that way and it 's really good to do that			0
' @entity64 ended the competition as leading scorer , with his 47th - minute header taking his tally to 12 the @entity45 under 18 international was handed a taste of first - team action by @entity9 in october 's @entity108 tie with @entity109 and he is hopeful of further opportunities in the future			1
