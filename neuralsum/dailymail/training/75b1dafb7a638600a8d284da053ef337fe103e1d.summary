by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 15:39 est , 23 august 2012 after facing a carpeting from the @entity5 for cavorting naked with a mystery woman in a @entity8 hotel room , prince @entity2 's burgeoning reputation as a mature young statesman looked to be on the line			1
but it appears many think that rather than be ridiculed for his drunken game of ' strip billiards ' this week in @entity14 , he should instead be congratulated for being being the model @entity16 playboy			2
revealing images showing the third in line to the throne standing in a vip hotel suite in only a necklace with a mystery nude brunette hiding behind him were seen by millions across the world online			0
it was assumed that he would be lambasted for bringing the royal family into global disrepute but , in fact , @entity30 is awash with thousands of comments from admiring celebrities and fans saying he was a ' good lad ' acting ' exactly as a @entity2 should do '			1
even sir @entity36 said : ' shock horror , single man naked in own hotel room with woman			0
what on earth has this got to do with anybody else ? leave prince @entity2 alone			1
' leave him alone : sir @entity45 was one of many who leapt to the defence of the third in line to the throne support : @entity52 was one of many celebrities to back the prince publicly as public opinion appeared to swing in @entity2 's favour rock royalty : @entity59 's former wife and musician , @entity61 , also backed his behaviour as becoming of a prince but the prince has n't avoided criticism completely			1
some of @entity67 's most high profile columnists have attacked his naked antics , with some saying he is a ' disgrace ' who should be stripped of his royal title and privileges			1
last night the @entity5 banned the @entity16 press from using the pictures , which are freely available online			1
should @entity16 newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of prince @entity2 in @entity8 ? the @entity78 used its main leader column to warn @entity2 of the consequences of his mistakes in a @entity83 hotel this week , especially after he had represented @entity16 and the royal family so well at the @entity85			1
' prince @entity2 is the occupant of a special place in the nation 's heart			1
like a royal @entity91 the prince has earned a rare licence to be seen having fun , ' it said , adding : ' but he must tread carefully and in future , more carefully than this			2
' his reinvention has been a joy to behold , with a new maturity becoming evident alongside his easy manner and charm			0
as a single young man , blessed with money and looks , he is perfectly free to set his sights on being the nation 's favourite playboy			0
but it would be a shame			0
' letting his heir down : prince @entity2 relaxed poolside surrounded by bikini - clad girls in @entity8 and even played naked billiards put the public appear to want to back him for it party - boy : ' @entity2 , far right in a hat , went to @entity8 to relax after the @entity85 but it gout of hand a quick search on the the internet allows people to see the pictures that are ' banned ' in the @entity16 an identical search on @entity124 images for ' @entity2 naked pictures ' reveals dozens more shots of the cavorting @entity2 the @entity129 's @entity128 said @entity2 had ignored his responsibilities to the @entity131 and the @entity132			1
' what was prince @entity2 thinking of ? he ’s not a gormless 19 - year - old boy any more			1
he ’s a grown - up man , a 27 - year - old @entity135 officer who also happens to be third in line to the throne , ' he wrote			0
' he belongs to an institution that stands for certain forms of behaviour , and can not survive if its members flout them			0
opinion : the @entity16 press was barred from using the pictures , despite them being freely available online , the @entity78 said in its leader column , adding , in essence , that @entity2 is likeable but has to grow up ' indeed , the @entity2 belongs to two such institutions : he is an officer in the @entity135 , and as such is expected to observe its own code of ethics			1
that this , too , was broken during this trip to @entity8 is no coincidence			0
the @entity135 is another institution that requires discipline , restraint , forbearance and sacrifice			0
' the @entity161 's @entity160 said : ' how unfortunate that when things were going so well for him , @entity2 gets caught with his pants down – literally – and pictures of him partying naked are beamed across the world			2
' who on earth advised the third in line to the throne to indulge in some " full - on partying " in the world ’s self - styled capital of sleaze , @entity8 ? trashing : the @entity129 's esteemed commentator @entity128 laid into @entity2 and his antics in this morning 's paper critical : @entity128 questioned @entity2 's maturity and ability to make the right decisions ' @entity182 vodka shots and cavorting until the early hours of the morning with bikini - clad wannabes , this was more the world of soft - porn films than the behaviour expected of the @entity131 ’s grandson			2
opinion : the @entity161 's @entity160 said she had sympathy for @entity2 for what he has experienced in life , but believed his vegas strip billiards showed huge error of judgment ' we had come to think that poor judgment and immaturity were all in the past for @entity2			2
for , at the age of 27 , he is now a man with the responsibilities of an army officer			0
' so , yes , we have made allowances for @entity2 , but he will be 28 next month and it ’s time he grew up			2
' the @entity203 was even stronger in its criticism , saying that the prince should be stripped of his title			0
' what shall we do with prince @entity2 ? it has n't even been two weeks since he represented the @entity131 at the closing ceremony of the @entity85 , and there he is in @entity211 , naked , playing strip billiards , ' said writer @entity213			1
' i have an idea for him and for other members of the royal family who gad about and undermine the hard work of the rest of their team ( prince @entity222 , anyone ? ) ' let 's strip them of their royal status			1
he could get as drunk as he likes and strip of all over the place – just like any old toff			0
' he 'd still have a job			0
he has a real job in the army already that has nothing to do with being royal			0
' he 's a captain in the @entity233 and @entity234 and has served in @entity235 – at his own behest			0
but if you remember , he had to be pulled out because of publicity over his royal status			0
so being royal is nothing but a pain for him			0
' but despite the criticism , the online world seems to be backing the prince , especially celebrities			0
@entity160 said that @entity2 's behaviour had got out of control on his @entity250 jaunt @entity16 dj @entity251 said : ' prince @entity2 is doing exactly as a prince should do			1
' fellow @entity251 @entity254 added : prince @entity2 is easily the best royal , ' while 80s pop star @entity256 said : ' i love prince @entity2 getting his kit off and having fun before duty in @entity235 ( hanistan )			1
@entity261 ! ' boy @entity262 tweeted : ' @entity2 , where was his security ? people are so cheap , such rubbish photos ! the @entity131 should behead @entity267 and send the bitches to @entity269			2
' star backing : boy @entity262 said that security and ' cheap ' partygoers were to blame for the incident , not @entity2 , above and below @entity251 backing : @entity275 believes that @entity2 's exploits should be celebrated pop star : @entity256 said that @entity2 needed to let his hair down before returning to work as a captain in the army he 's the best : @entity254 really enjoyed what @entity2 had been up to " i 'm shocked and disgusted by the @entity2 party photos in @entity8			1
why the hell was n't i invited ? ? ? ' @entity52 said , to which @entity286 star @entity285 replied : ' @entity288 this tweet made me laugh out loud ! ' @entity290 said ' wow you gotla [ sic ] love prince @entity2 for showing off the royal jewels ...			1
oh let him have fun , xc ' and the public also sung his praises : @ @entity298 said : ' whatever happened to " @entity299 " ? # @entity300 ' envious : popstar and presenter @entity302 says that people have a motive for castigating the prince and his behaviour sporting chance : @entity310 star for champions @entity311 , @entity312 , called @entity2 a ' ledge ' , short for legend @ gaylefortes _ added : ' what happens in @entity8 stays in @entity8			1
unless you 're prince @entity2			2
. @entity319 poor thing ' @ @entity320 tweeted : ' who cares what prince @entity2 did in @entity8 ? ! he has to act like a prude 24/7 , do you blame him for trying to live a little ? ! '			2

as revealing photos of the prince sweep the internet , celebrities and fans rush to congratulate him on his antics
instead of *damaging* his reputation , many believe the pictures will enhance how the public view @entity2
but national newspapers were n't so complimentary , with some columnists *branding* him a ' disgrace ' to the royal family and the @entity16 army
