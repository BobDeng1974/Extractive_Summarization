it may be just a stone 's throw away from the mass urban sprawl that is @entity4 , but nobody lives there and just an abandoned prison and empty lunatic asylum remain as evidence that the island was ever inhabited			0
@entity4 's mysterious @entity12 is , however , home to up to a million graves - many of them poor and unidentified , others interred there because of unfortunate circumstances			1
the city 's authorities have been using the island , which is technically part of the @entity20 district , as a city graveyard , burying bodies in plain pine boxes piled on top of one another and marked only with a number , since 1868			1
long time practice : this archive picture shows prisoners from the now derelict @entity30 burying bodies on the island			1
it is estimated that as many as one million people could be buried in mass graves there @entity36 : a picture taken in 1990 shows a large trench dug ready for hundreds of bodies to be buried			1
pine boxes used as coffins can be ssen at one end of the trench the @entity43 , which is in charge of the mass cemetary , estimates that there are between 750,000 and a million people buried on the island , which is visible on @entity49 but not included on the @entity51 line			1
the last public ferry to the island completed its final journey in 1976			0
according to @entity55 , burials began at the island 's northernmost tip , which became known as @entity58 , when the city bought the island for $ 75,000			2
but that cemetary reportedly filled up over the last few years and burials moved to the south side of the island			0
city limits : just within the boundaries of the @entity20 is @entity12 where over 850,000 people are buried in @entity4 in 2010 , some 695 adults and 504 babies were buried there by prisoners from @entity72 's @entity71 bodies are stacked three high with each grave containing up to 165 bodies and hidden from the world by 36 inches of dirt			1
a separate grave for stillborn babies and foetuses contains as many as 1,000 miniature boxes			0
among those buried there is the first child to die of aids in @entity4 - one of the few to be afforded an individual grave marked @entity87 1985 ( standing for special child , baby 1 , and the year of death ) - as well as famous writers and actors including @entity92 who played @entity93 in the 1953 @entity95 movie			2
off limits : the mysterious island still appears on @entity49 , but access to it is restricted and members of the public need special permission to go there @entity92 died in 1968 and his body was found in a deserted tenement by two children playing			0
his body could not be identified and when it went unclaimed he was buried on @entity12			1
the following year his mother contacted @entity95 in the hope of reuniting @entity92 with his desparately ill father before he died			0
but an @entity111 fingerprint search located his body on @entity12			1
his name appears on his father 's gravestone at a @entity116 cemetery , but his remains are still on @entity12			1
but , according @entity55 , while many of those buried there are destitute or unidentified , others should n't be there at all			2
@entity122 cites the case of obstetrician and gynecologist @entity124 who gave birth to a stillborn baby in 1993			0
ms @entity124 almost died in the difficult delivery of the baby and was barely conscious when permission was granted to bury her child on @entity12 , although she could have afforded a funeral and her family already owned a burial plot			2
although between 60 and 80 people are disinterred a year to be buried elsewhere when family members claim the remains of their loved ones , others like ms @entity124 are reluctant			0
many graves were destroyed when the @entity141 operated a battery of @entity144 missiles there in the late 1950s and early 1960s in a bid to defend the city from potential nuclear attack from the @entity149			2
many bodies were also buried below the water table , meaning that the bodies and their coffins were all but destroyed and the plots were reused			1
although records of all bodies buried there have been written in logbooks , some were destroyed in a fire on the island in the 1970s - records of around 25,000 people were lost - and some are illegible			1
famous : it is not just poor people buried there			0
@entity169 actor @entity92 , pictured with his mother and father , @entity171 and @entity172 in 1949 , was buried there after his death in 1968 an error from 1989 and discovered years later found that two mass graves were given the same number			0
one of the graves was later renumbered , but given the same marking as another grave from the 1970s			0
ms @entity124 's reason for not reclaiming the body of her stillborn baby ? ' i do n't trust their system ' , she told @entity55 .			0
