it was among the most emotional speeches at last year ’s @entity2			0
a young anti-crime campaigner , @entity3 , was given a standing ovation from mps including @entity6 and @entity7 when she movingly told how eight members of her family had been murdered			1
but now it has emerged that most of the ‘ victims ’ the campaigner claimed had died are in fact alive and well			2
@entity3 and @entity13 discussed her campaign against violence as they walked around @entity17 after miss @entity3 was forced to admit using ‘ misleading ’ words in her speech , @entity2 officials were criticised for not checking her story before she was presented to the conference last september			1
the 24 - year - old , a member of the @entity24 , took to the stage in @entity27 to address the party faithful and accused the @entity29 of carrying out pr stunts rather than tackling the important issues			0
she told the audience last september : ‘ i am here to talk about why our young people are dying before they can see the age of 21			0
‘ we are here to challenge young people in asking the important question : why join a gang , use a gun , or use a knife ? ’ labour leader @entity13 met @entity3 on a visit to @entity17 she continued : ‘ this is an issue that is causing a huge problem across the @entity46 , including @entity47 , @entity27 , @entity48 , @entity49 and in my own area @entity17 – with eight of my family members being murdered there			1
i am not a celebrity , i am simply a young person who has had enough of seeing family members , friends and other lives being taken before they can succeed in life			2
’ in a subsequent newspaper interview , miss @entity3 , of @entity59 , @entity17 , gave two examples of genuine victims to whom she had links			1
one , @entity64 , who was stabbed to death in the city in 2002 , was her cousin , although the pair had never met			0
she said another , 17 - year - old @entity69 , who was killed in september 2009 , was a friend of hers			0
but a @entity72 current affairs team making a documentary about miss @entity3 ’s work began investigating her claims to have lost eight members of her family to knife and gun crime , and say it emerged that most of the people she claimed had been murdered were actually alive			1
they claim she was also found communicating on @entity83 with some of the people she had insisted were dead			1
when questioned by the @entity72 , miss @entity3 admitted that the majority of the people she told them about had not been murdered			1
yesterday she said she ‘ may have used words which could be seen as misleading ’ and expressed ‘ regret ’			1
she told the regional @entity90 programme , broadcast last night on @entity91 : ‘ i have lost three family members and five very close friends who i consider as family			2
at conference : miss @entity3 addresses delegates - and , right , @entity6 gives her a standing ovation ‘ i realise i may have used words which could be seen as misleading and i do regret this			1
’ she then bizarrely claimed that she had changed the names in her story to shield the families of the ‘ real ’ victims , explaining : ‘ i do admit that the names originally given to [ the @entity72 ] were false			0
this was done to protect the families of my friends that i have lost			0
‘ but i was not corresponding with anyone on @entity83 , i rarely talk to people on @entity83			2
’ miss @entity3 , who met @entity2 leader @entity13 when he came to @entity17 after last summer ’s riots , stood for the party during the 2011 local council elections			2
she was said to be in @entity47 yesterday and is currently working on a campaign calling for more funding for community activists			0
last night @entity116 , regional director of @entity117 , said : ‘ she has not been suspended and we will not be making any further comment on the matter			0
’ the ‘ star ’ of the same @entity124 conference at which miss @entity3 spoke last year was 16 - year - old @entity121			1
the schoolboy was feted as a ‘ hero ’ after his impassioned speech telling how the welfare state saved his family from ruin			0
but the @entity132 revealed that he was actually the privileged son of a millionaire property developer , and attended private school until his father ’s business went bust			0
@entity3 speaking to the @entity2 in september 2011 :			2

@entity3 received a standing ovation as she spoke about eight ' family ' murders
