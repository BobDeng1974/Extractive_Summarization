@entity0 approved a $ 225 million package to replenish @entity3 's missile defenses with its last order of business before a five - week recess , as the jewish state 's cease - fire with @entity7 unraveled and @entity3 forces pushed deep into @entity11 in search of a missing army officer			1
the @entity15 's 395 - 8 vote in favor late friday followed @entity18 adoption of the legislation by voice vote earlier in the day			2
the money is directed toward restocking @entity3 's @entity22 , which has been credited with shooting down dozens of incoming rockets fired by @entity25 militants over 3½ weeks of war			1
at a @entity15 news conference earlier friday , the president reiterated his support for @entity3 's right to self - defense while urging greater protection for @entity25 civilians			1
@entity32 called for the immediate release of the soldier believed to be captured by @entity7 and said it would be hard to put together another cease - fire after a 72 - hour humanitarian truce collapsed almost immediately after going into effect friday morning			1
he also cited @entity22 as a concrete way the @entity48 is helping ' make sure that @entity3 is able to protect its citizens			1
' the defense system has emerged as a game - changer in the current round of violence with @entity3 officials citing a success rate as high as 90 per cent			1
@entity22 uses radar , advanced tracking technology and anti-missile batteries to follow the trajectory of an incoming rocket or mortar and determine if it is headed for a major population center			1
if an urban area is threatened , interceptors are fired to detonate in the air in close proximity to the missile			0
projectiles not posing a threat are allowed to fall in empty fields			0
the @entity3 military said it was searching for the missing soldier and sent automated calls or text messages to residents to stay indoors the system targets short - range rockets with a range between 2 miles and 45 miles ; interceptors cost as much $ 100,000 apiece			1
created by @entity3 's @entity80 , @entity22 has enjoyed strong @entity48 technological and financial support			1
throughout its history , the @entity48 has provided more than $ 700 million to help @entity3 cover costs for batteries , interceptors , production costs and maintenance , the @entity83 said			2
the total already appeared set to climb above $ 1 billion after @entity18 appropriators doubled the @entity32 administration 's request for @entity22 funding for fiscal 2015			2
now it seems likely to rise even further , with @entity32 expected to sign any bill swiftly into law			0
it 's unclear , however , how quickly the new supplies might reach the battlefield			0
and @entity3 and @entity7 may be in for a prolonged fight			0
at least 140 palestinians and two @entity3 soldiers were killed friday			0
fighting near the @entity105 - @entity11 frontier continued into the night , with residents reporting airstrikes and heavy tank and artillery shelling			0
the @entity3 military said it was searching for the missing soldier and sent automated calls or text messages to residents to stay indoors			0
the soldier 's apparent capture also prompting a shift in messaging by the @entity32 administration , which had appeared increasingly irritated with the mounting @entity25 casualties over the last several days			2
more than 1,600 palestinians , mostly civilians , and more than 60 israelis , mostly soldiers , have been killed in the conflict			0
@entity0 approved a $ 225 million package to replenish @entity3 's missile defenses with its last order of business before a five - week recess , as the jewish state 's cease - fire with @entity7 unraveled and @entity3 forces pushed deep into @entity11 in search of a missing army officer despite almost universal support for @entity3 in @entity0 , the @entity22 money appeared in doubt only a day ago as @entity18 efforts stalled after an effort by @entity141 sen. @entity140 of @entity142 to find cuts elsewhere in the budget to pay for the aid			1
earlier , senators attempted to lump the @entity3 money into a broader spending bill that included border security and wildfire assistance money			2
that bill failed to get the necessary 60 votes on thursday , and the @entity15 had little interest in it , anyway			0
both chambers turned their attention to a separate @entity3 bill friday			0
voting against the measure in the @entity15 were democrats @entity158 of @entity159 , @entity160 of @entity161 , @entity162 of @entity163 and @entity164 of @entity165 , and republicans @entity166 of @entity168 , @entity169 of @entity170 , @entity171 of @entity172 and @entity173 of @entity174			0
some of @entity0 ' @entity22 money could go to @entity48 defense contractor @entity176 , which can manufacture components of the system after a march 2014 agreement between @entity3 and the @entity48			1
the two companies also are collaborating on a system targeting mid-range rockets that can travel between 45 miles and 200 miles to protect @entity3 against @entity184 in @entity185 and president @entity187 's government and @entity189 extremists in @entity190			1
with an eye on @entity192 , @entity3 also is developing a deterrent against longer - range threats			2
the next generation of the @entity197 system is scheduled to deploy in 2016 .			0
