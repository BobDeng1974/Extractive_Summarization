by @entity1 reporter published : 19:35 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 15 march 2013 the road to late president @entity4 's final resting place in @entity5 showed just how impoverished ordinary @entity6 are , as parade pictures showed some of the most dangerous slums on the planet			1
while tens of thousands of mourners lined the streets to mourn former president @entity4 's passage to the museum where he will be displayed indefinitely , it highlighted how severe problems in @entity6 are for who ever will lead the country next			1
mr @entity4 , who ruled for 14 years , died of cancer last week			1
@entity4 's legacy : the funeral route of @entity6 's late president @entity4 revealed the horrifying conditions in which many @entity6 live tens of thousands of @entity6 gathered along that route today to watch the late president 's body cross the city in another choreographed show designed to keep @entity4 supporters in thrall , at least until an april 14 election scheduled to replace him			1
all along the funeral route were unmistakable signs that this 28 million - person country is not only unsafe , but that its basic services no longer work			2
the parade showed bridges in dire need of repair and food shops looking sparse and understocked			2
vying for power : @entity6 's acting president @entity44 drives a military vehicle while his foreign minister @entity46 ( top centre ) , president of @entity49 ( top left ) and other members of his government lead the funeral parade crumbling apartment towers and food lines often shared the pavement with cheering crowds eager to greet their departed @entity57			1
' more than anything , the government continues fighting with everyone , and does everything badly , ' said @entity62 , a 54 - year - old carpenter who lives with his wife and five children in the poor neighborhood of @entity66 , a few streets from the funeral route			2
like many @entity6 , @entity62 said wartime - levels of street violence all over the city were his top worry			1
' they kill people here every day , ' he said			0
' i 've lost friends , relatives			0
' elaborate mourning : onlookers throw confetti as his body was being transferred from a military academy , where it has been lying in state , to the military museum as thousands of bused - in police academy cadets gathered along the route , @entity62 and his wife @entity87 were waiting in line to buy flour , coffee , butter and other food staples that they said have been hard to come by for about two years			1
the shop , which sat along the most trafficked part of the route , drew a crowd of people desperate for a few bags of flour			0
' the word spread in the street , and we all came running here , ' said @entity107 's wife , @entity87 , a cook 's assistant			2
economists say government - imposed price controls designed to dampen inflation topping 20 percent have made it impossible for shop owners to sell basic foods at a profit , sparking widespread shortages			1
pomp and ceremony : the presidential guard soldiers carry the coffin at the start of a procession in which @entity6 lined up to bid their last farewell to @entity4			1
in the background a portrait of independence hero @entity126			0
officials have accused suppliers of hoarding the goods and have invaded warehouses looking for sugar , flour and other food items in short supply			2
' you ca n't find anything , ' said 27 - year - old lawyer @entity137 , who rode a bus for four hours from the town of @entity140 to view the funeral cortege			0
wearing a heart - shaped ' i am @entity4 ' badge , she said she was taking the opportunity to also stock up on basic goods			1
people in her town have even had to go without toothpaste and toilet paper , she said			0
' it 's all the plan of the private businesses , ' she said , repeating the government 's line of attack			2
' they want to hold onto everything so that it riles up people			0
' a few blocks from the military museum , @entity158 watched government supporters pass by in red t - shirts bearing @entity4 's image			1
raw sewage trickled from a broken pipe down the street , and the 37 - year - old insurance agent scolded his two sons for playing nearby			0
lying in state : religious and political ceremonies were held at the military museum , attended by mr @entity4 's chosen successor @entity44 ' the majority of them do n't complain about the problems here , ' @entity158 whispered about the passing @entity4 supporters			1
' it 's as if they did n't exist			2
' @entity158 said he does n't have that luxury			0
violent crime is so bad in his part of town that he and his family shut themselves inside their home every night by 6 p.m. , only opening the iron gate covering his front door the next morning			0
yet for @entity158 , staying indoors might not be enough to protect him and his family from the war outside			0
several weeks ago , a stray bullet penetrated the zinc roof of a neighbor 's house			2
almost all of @entity5 ' streets empty of people by dusk as residents with a homicide rate 20 times that of the @entity201			1
on thursday , the @entity202 issued a study finding @entity6 had the world 's fifth highest homicide rate , behind @entity206 , @entity207 , the @entity208 and @entity209			1
many believe the police are a big part of the problem			2
death of a strong leader : @entity4 's brothers @entity216 , left , and @entity218 , right carried his coffin , while thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse in an astounding revelation , former justice minister @entity224 said in 2009 that police were responsible for up to 20 per cent of the country 's crimes			1
' i just stay inside now , ' @entity158 said			0
' outside , it 's not safe			2
' the hills around the military academy are covered with bare - brick slums			0
more @entity6 have moved into such slums during @entity4 's government , casualties of a housing deficit that the human rights group @entity236 estimates at 2 million units			1
official figures show the number of houses deemed " inadequate " in the country grew from 295,000 in 1999 to more than 404,000 in 2011			0
the growth of such neighborhoods has contributed to other problems			0
due to crumbling or inexistent infrastructure , sewage all over the city goes mainly to one place : the once - pristine @entity251 , which runs along most of @entity4 's funeral route			1
in 2005 , @entity4 had famously promised that @entity6 would one day be able to swim in its waters			1
trying to do that today would be nothing less than life - threatening			0
military might : @entity4 was keen to show off his army credentials at parades in @entity5 retired truck driver @entity259 said he remembered the idyllic scene there decades ago , when the river was a perfect place to spend a sunny day			1
he lives in the neighborhood of @entity265 , close to the river and within sight of the funeral route			0
' the city grew too much , ' the 67 - year - old said			0
' in the 30s and in the 40s , people bathed in this river			0
... here , when it rains , it 's chaos , you see that the river sometimes spills over when it rains			0
' @entity277 , who had stopped by a bakery near the route , said he had given up on any change under the current government , led by @entity4 's hand - picked successor @entity44			1
' it is n't easy , brother , ' @entity277 said as @entity4 supporters headed to the river to watch the cortege pass			2
it creates stress , stress in the family , stress at work			0

despite crowds of mourners on the streets , @entity4 's worrying legacy was *visible* in @entity5 's dangerous slums
@entity6 *capital* has fifth highest homicide rate in the world
former justice minister @entity224 said police are responsible for up to 20 per cent of @entity6 's crimes
while thousands were on the streets to mourn @entity4 's passing , others were *queuing* up to get basic food
