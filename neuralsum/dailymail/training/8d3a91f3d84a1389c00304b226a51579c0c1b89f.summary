mr @entity0 : @entity1 , singer of @entity2 was not always this steady on stage with a new @entity8 single , an appearance on tomorrow ’s @entity5 and their first hits collection , @entity2 are marking the tenth anniversary of their debut @entity11 gig with their customary swagger			1
the @entity15 rockers , fronted by @entity1 , have sold 22 million albums and headlined at @entity17 , @entity18 and even the @entity19			1
but the ride has not always been smooth			2
early hits like mr @entity0 were universally lauded , but the band ’s second album , 2006 ’s @entity22 , was initially mauled by critics and fans alike — and @entity1 was badly stung			1
‘ i struggled with that response , ’ @entity1 admits			1
‘ i had felt compelled to show something of where i come from — smalltown @entity28 — and the @entity29 destroyed me for it			2
‘ i made the mistake of believing the bad reviews			2
they convinced me i was just a pop tart who did n’t belong in the realm of serious rock artists			2
' our following album , @entity37 , was a total reaction to @entity22			2
’ the singer is more philosophical these days			2
the new retrospective , @entity42 , draws material from all four of their studio albums , with the @entity47 guitars of the @entity22 numbers sitting seamlessly alongside poppier , synth - powered tracks			2
‘ i ’m happy we ’ve finally released a hits album , ’ says the 32 - year - old , who formed @entity2 with guitarist @entity51 in 2001			1
‘ i grew up with “ best - of ” cassettes			0
my first @entity56 record was @entity58 and i had hits albums by @entity60 and @entity61			2
’ chatting ahead of @entity62 , which also features @entity60 , @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity1 says he is now more at ease with himself than in the past			1
on stage : @entity1 with his fellow bandmates in @entity2 on the @entity69 last year ‘ on our first @entity71 tour , i was still wondering whether i was good enough to do this , ’ he admits			1
‘ our first gig was in a pub , the @entity74 in @entity75 , and i was so nervous that i fell offstage during @entity78			1
‘ there had been a lot of hoopla beforehand about us being the next big thing , so it was very embarrassing			0
’ the new assurance stems partly from a settled home life in @entity15			1
since marrying childhood sweetheart @entity86 eight years ago , @entity1 has become the proud father of three sons			1
a devout @entity89 , he avoids alcohol and drugs			0
‘ i used to drink			0
but , as you get older , and have a wife and children , the dynamic starts to change , ’ he says			0
‘ the drinking is fun when it starts , but it does n’t always end that way			0
‘ i live a normal life			0
but i ’m always thinking about what i ’m going to do next , musically			0
do i need a fresh producer ? what was @entity102 doing when he was 32 ? ’ originally influenced by @entity11 acts like @entity105 and @entity106 — @entity1 was once praised for his ‘ genuine fake @entity108 accent ’ — the @entity2 have since sought inspiration closer to home , working alongside @entity111 and @entity112			1
killing it : the @entity2 have sold 22 million albums and headlined at @entity17 , @entity18 and even the @entity19 having collaborated with @entity111 on @entity115 , the opening track on the 2007 rarities album @entity118 , @entity1 was saddened to hear of the rock pioneer ’s death			1
‘ spending time with @entity111 was surreal because of the folklore that surrounds him , ’ he says			0
‘ we were scared to death , but he was sweet , and great to work with			0
the night he died , we played a show in @entity15 and sang @entity126 in tribute			1
’ the @entity112 liaison came about at a rock festival in @entity130			0
‘ we were playing mr @entity0 when i saw @entity47 really going for it at the side of the stage			2
that was like some weird dream			0
he suggested i join him onstage later for @entity136 , and i jumped at the chance			0
that song is part of my dna			0
’ beyond the hits cd — and @entity143 , the @entity2 ’ eighth festive charity single — the band will take a breather			1
@entity1 is working on a solo album , but he assures me that he will return to the group when the time is right			1
‘ this is the end of something , ’ he says			0
‘ maybe we have become too comfortable			0
i ’ll do my solo stuff and then come back to give @entity2 a kick in the pants			1
’ @entity42 is out on @entity155 .			0

@entity1 fell off the stage on his first @entity71 gig in @entity75 in 2003
the @entity2 , from @entity15 has sold *22million* albums
band is set to play the @entity163 this *weekend*
