crackdown : researchers found some supermarkets are selling alcohol so cheaply that it costs less than mineral water supermarkets are selling alcohol so cheaply that cans of lager and cider cost less than mineral water			1
new research shows the price cuts – introduced in time for the @entity11 – mean consumers can drink more than their daily recommended alcohol limit for less than £ 1			2
it prompted experts to demand a ban on alcohol prices at ' dangerously low levels ' because it was fuelling health problems , crime and antisocial behaviour			1
the findings are also a blow for @entity24 who two years ' ago announced a crackdown on bargain - basket alcohol prices by saying : ' when beer is cheaper than water , it 's just too easy for people to get drunk on cheap alcohol at home before they even set foot in the pub. ' but the prime minister was forced to water down a new minimum price for alcohol of 45p a unit in the face of a revolt by most of the @entity41 who warned it would punish responsible drinkers on low incomes			1
instead , the government outlawed ' very cheap ' alcohol – despite admitting it would have little impact on problem drinking			2
an investigation by @entity51 's dispatches found three supermarket chains selling lager cheaper than sparkling @entity55 water			1
@entity56 sold multipacks of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 at 69p a pint and @entity63 cider for 65p a pint			2
this compared with @entity55 mineral water costing 73p a pint			1
in @entity69 , the same beers could be bought for 72p a pint , compared with 76p a pint for @entity55			1
and at @entity72 's , 20 cans of @entity58 was 72p a pint while 15 cans of @entity63 cost £ 8 , equating to 69p a pint , 7p less than a pint of sparkling water			1
researchers also found that @entity56 and @entity69 have also been selling two - litre bottles of own - brand cider for £ 2.25 which means a man could drink his recommended daily alcohol limit for £ 1 and a woman for 75p			1
@entity86 , director at the @entity87 , said : ' the government has completely reneged on its commitment to tackle pocket money - priced alcohol , which is fuelling rates of disease and disorder in the @entity95			0
' public health and crime prevention experts wrote an open letter yesterday sun calling on the government to take ' urgent action to curb the damage caused by cheap drink '			0
the 21 specialists criticised ministers for failing to ' tackle the burden that cheap alcohol places on society '			0
@entity69 , along with @entity56 and @entity72 's , were found to be selling alcohol at less than the price of a bottle of @entity55 recent government figures showed alcohol abuse is costing the country more than £ 21billion a year through crime , accidents and disease			1
the experts , including professor @entity118 , the special advisor on alcohol to the @entity120 , warned @entity121 ' risked being left behind to deal with a growing burden of disease and social disorder ' as @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 push ahead with plans for minimum unit pricing for alcohol			1
the prime minister had proposed to ban the sale of alcohol at less than 45p a unit in @entity121 and @entity126			2
it would have meant a can of strong lager could not be sold for less than £ 1.56 , a bottle of wine for less than £ 4.22 and spirits for £ 12.60			0
but the plan was dumped last summer after strong opposition from within the @entity41 and a lobbying campaign by the drinks industry			0
ministers insisted it would be disastrous to penalise hardworking families who drank responsibly			0
instead , the @entity148 announced in february it would ban ' very cheap ' booze – effectively the first ever minimum pricing regime			2
but campaigners dismissed it as ' laughable ' when it emerged that supermarkets would still be allowed to sell cans of strong lager for as little as 50p , wine for £ 2.24 and 750ml spirits for just £ 10.16			2
the new system works by banning shops and pubs from selling alcohol at less than the total cost of the duty payable to the @entity164 , plus vat			0
the @entity166 , which represents supermarkets , said : ' the efforts of retailers working with the government to give clear health information [ and ] reinforce health messages			0
are having an effect and we are committed to building on these			0
' crime prevention minister @entity175 said : ' there has been no government u-turn on minimum unit pricing			0
it is still on the radar , but it is sensible to await the legal ruling in @entity125 before advancing it further in @entity121			0
' our ban on the sale of alcohol below the cost of duty plus vat is the first ever government intervention to set a floor for alcohol prices and its significance should not be underestimated			1
it is after all a minimum price of sorts			1
it will stop the worst examples of very cheap and harmful drink			0

@entity56 , @entity69 and @entity72 's all sell lager cheaper than @entity55
findings prompt experts to demand a ban on low alcohol prices
it comes after @entity211 was forced to water down a new minimum price
