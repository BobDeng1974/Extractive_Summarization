by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 06:14 est , 25 june 2012 controversial : a leaked e-mail from @entity2 , pictured , has asked staff to come up with money - making schemes the @entity6 has told its own journalists they must come up with ideas to make the corporation more money , a leaked e-mail has revealed			1
management are insisting its 2,400 staff at @entity13 devise cash - generating schemes to present at their staff appraisals , calling into question its future editorial independence			1
with the @entity6 already making redundancies and budget cuts , journalists have been told they must : ' exploit new commercial opportunities ( and ) maximise the value we create with our journalism			1
' critics fear that this could lead to them ignoring important stories across the globe in favour of ones that will bring in extra cash			0
it came as the corporation is being investigated by media watchdog @entity34 , who are looking into how some @entity37 programmes became ' commercially influenced '			2
@entity6 bosses have already apologised for these mistakes			2
@entity2 , the director of @entity6 @entity40 , told his journalists that their official appraisals will include an objective section on their ability to generate cash			2
his leaked e-mail to @entity47 says : ' with the income objective , let us know if you have any ideas on how we can strengthen our commercial focus and grow income			0
' no matter where you work , you can help meet these objectives			0
they have been designed to encompass all departments , using strengths and expertise of all members of staff			0
' please use these objectives during your appraisal to talk through with your line manager what these objectives mean to you as an individual and your role in the fulfilment of them			0
' the move has been branded ' appalling ' by former @entity6 staff and union leaders , who say the @entity6 's editorial independence could be compromised , especially in areas like @entity76 and @entity77			1
regrettable move : former correspondent and mp @entity80 says the @entity6 is not a money - making organisation @entity37 already sells adverts on its tv channel as well as on @entity84 , an international version of its news website			1
former war reporter and mp @entity80 told the @entity47 : ' the @entity6 is not a money - making organisation			1
it is mostly a money - spending organisation			2
i find this a regrettable move			0
' @entity93 , who was managing director of the @entity95 for seven years , said to the paper : ' the notion that as a journalist you are having to think about how you can sell or turn your output into money is just so wide of the mark			0
if he [ @entity103 ] pushes it too far he can start to undermine the values of trust on which the @entity95 news has existed for 80 - odd years			0
it sounds like management gobbledy - gook			0
' anger : @entity111 politician @entity110 visits the @entity95 last week , but people fear a move towards commercialism could compromise its output @entity116 , the general secretary of the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , added it was a ' shocking development ' that threatened the ' ethos at the heart of public service broadcasting			0
' the @entity6 today denied to @entity122 that the plans would compromise its integrity			2
' it is not true that the @entity6 's international journalists are being ' ordered to make money , ' a spokesman said			1
' the job of the @entity6 's journalists will always remain providing impartial , independent news and there are no specific commercial targets for frontline journalists			1
' the @entity6 â€™s public service mission to provide impartial and independent news will always takes precedence over wider commercial goals and nothing in this email suggests any different			1
' the @entity6 's international news services such as @entity37 and @entity84 already have a long tradition of generating commercial income to reinvest in independent public service journalism and these objectives simply aimed to reflect that			1

@entity37 boss @entity2 tells 2,400 staff to ' exploit new commercial opportunities ' and present them at their appraisals
critics say the @entity6 's integrity and editorial independence would be completely compromised by the move
former war reporter @entity80 says : ' the @entity6 is not a money - making organisation '
@entity6 admits e-mail is genuine but tells @entity122 ' impartial , independent news will always come first '
