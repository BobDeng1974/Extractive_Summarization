@entity1 's astonishing rabona strike was one of the best goals @entity4 head coach @entity3 has ever seen			1
some had written off the club - record Â£ 30million signing after a disappointing , albeit injury - interrupted , first season with the north @entity8			2
@entity1 is , though , at last beginning to show glimpses of his undoubted quality under the tutorship of former @entity13 international @entity3			1
@entity1 's astonishing rabona strike put @entity4 in control against @entity15 @entity4 boss @entity3 seemed unimpressed by @entity1 's goal at the time the attacking midfielder has yet to find the consistency his compatriot desires but impressed against @entity15 , scoring a brace as @entity4 won the @entity22 clash 5 - 1			1
@entity1 's second of the @entity25 encounter was an impressive volley from an acute angle , but the first was one of the finest goals ever seen at @entity31 - a rabona strike from the edge of the box			1
' one time i scored one goal like that myself , ' @entity3 said , laughing			2
' you will find it on @entity40			0
' no , it was a very big goal , a great goal , an unbelievable goal			2
i am happy for him and it helped us to get the three points			0
maybe it is the best [ by one of my players ever ]			0
' @entity3 gives @entity1 a pat on the back after his goalscoring exploits replays of the goal led to oohs and aahs from the @entity4 faithful , yet @entity3 sat motionless on the bench when the strike went in			1
' i never show emotion , ' he said , offering an explanation			0
' no , i show emotion at home and show it in my bed			0
' it is true , i am a manager that tries to be calm every time during the game			2
' sometimes i am very disappointed and angry , but i enjoy more after the game rather than during the game			0
' @entity70 marked his return to the side with a hat - trick in the @entity22 romp that anger includes the performance of his side in the closing stages of the match			1
@entity70 , fresh from netting his first hat - trick for @entity4 , had to don the goalkeeper 's gloves for the final minutes after @entity83 was sent off for bundling over @entity84			1
the resulting free - kick from @entity86 squirmed through @entity70 's grasp - a frustrating end to what had been for large parts an impressive display by @entity4			2
' it was okay , ' @entity3 said			2
' i am happy for the result , 5 - 1 , and disappointed with the last five minutes because we gave the possibility for them to play one v one with our ' keeper			1
@entity70 ended the game between the sticks after @entity83 saw red late on ' we need to manage better the game			1
i am disappointed with the last five minutes but after that happy with the result			0
our objective was to get the three points and it was done			0
' i think that @entity83 's behaviour was correct			0
unlucky because it was a red card but i am not happy with the last minutes because our line defensive was very high			0
' we gave the possibility to play in behind our defensive line and at 5 - 0 , with three minutes before the end of the game , we were not ready and focused in that action			1
' we gave them the possibility to play well one v one with the keeper and for that i am not happy			0

@entity1 *bagged* a brace in 5 - 1 @entity22 romp against @entity15
@entity70 *hammered* a hat - trick then ended the game between the sticks
@entity3 hails @entity1 's ' unbelievable ' first goal
