by @entity0 for most people , managing to catch one baseball at a @entity3 game would be considered something of a proud and memorable moment			1
but one baseball fan has taken things to another level entirely after collecting a staggering 7,537 balls , which he keeps in his apartment in @entity13 , @entity14			1
@entity15 , 36 , has now made it his life 's mission to collect 10,000 balls by snagging them from the stands at games			1
he said : ' i was n't good enough to be a @entity3 player but i 'm still probably better at judging and catching fly balls than 99.9 per cent of the public			1
' when i 'm at a game and the ball goes up in the air i 'm not even looking at it - i 'm already running and climbing over rows and planning my path and dodging vendors and people			0
' then i look up and if i 've done a good job the ball 's right there for me to catch			2
' mr @entity15 , who has even written books teaching others how to catch balls at games , began his hobby at the age of 15 and soon became obsessed with collecting balls			1
he now attends roughly three games every week during the course of the baseball season and has come up with a number of tricks to ensure he never leaves a stadium empty - handed			2
mr @entity15 estimates he has spent somewhere in the region of $ 100,000 and tens of thousands of hours honing his technique for being in the right place at the right time mr @entity15 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity62 , began his hobby at the age of 15 and soon became obsessed with collecting balls he said : ' there are a lot of strategies i use to catch so many baseballs , starting with showing up early for batting practice and bringing a glove			1
' i get a lot of balls thrown to me by the players and i ask foreign guys in their native languages			0
' i have a hat and shirt of all @entity3 teams , so i can dress up like i 'm a fan of whatever team is on the field			2
' i 'm definitely obsessed with this , it 's definitely an addiction			0
' however , his passion for collecting baseballs leaves little time for long - suffering girlfriend , @entity62 , 20			2
she said : ' i think if push came to shove and he had to choose he 'd probably go with baseball but that 's just who he is			0
mr @entity15 has now made it his life 's mission to collect 10,000 balls by snagging them from the stands at games ' there 's just no escaping it when i 'm with him and it 's game time			1
' i think i would be less supportive of it if he were n't the king of it , but since he basically created this whole world i feel like i have to support him			0
' now mr @entity15 , whose first book was called how to snag @entity108 , says he wo n't stop until he has collected 10,000 baseballs			1
he said : ' perhaps the biggest appeal for me in collecting baseballs is feeling like i 'm beating the odds and getting something special			0
' when the ball sails through the air 40,000 people are watching it - and who knows how many hundreds of thousands of people at home - and that ball ends up in my glove			0
' it 's just the most amazing feeling , there 's really not much else in the world that compares with that			0
