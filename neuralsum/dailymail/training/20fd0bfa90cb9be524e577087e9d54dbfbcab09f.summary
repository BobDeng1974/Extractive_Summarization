by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob nothing brings home the youthfulness of @entity4 ’s squad more than a quick check of their first @entity7 memories : @entity8 ’s are from @entity9 2010			1
‘ the first @entity7 i fully remember was the last one , when @entity10 [ @entity11 ] scored in the first game against the @entity13 , ’ said 19 - year - old @entity8			1
‘ i was sitting at home eating pizza with friends during the game and then we went out for a little kick - about at half - time to try to imitate these boys			1
’ @entity20 : @entity8 ( right ) in training with @entity4 team - mate @entity22 ahead of the @entity7 fully focused : @entity8 is looking forward to playing in the @entity7 at the age of just 19 @entity8 gestures towards to @entity11 , who is sting alongside him as part of the @entity7 squad			1
four years ago he was a 15 - year - old youth playing football on @entity27 in the shadow of @entity29 , though for most of his early life the stadium was a building site			1
only in his teens did the new stadium emerge and by then @entity8 was on @entity36 ’s books before joining @entity37 at 16			1
but no one epitomises the youthful potential of this @entity4 squad more than @entity8			1
he is not the youngest — that honour falls to @entity42 — but in terms of a young man most likely to make an impression on the world , @entity8 is the prime candidate			1
as pressure intensified in @entity37 ’s title run - in , @entity8 looked nerveless , becoming a key player in the title challenge , despite having being marginal at the start of the season			1
he fairly forced his way into the team with his pace , finishing and skill impossible to ignore			2
just ask @entity57 ’s back four			2
stars in his eyes : @entity8 ( right ) training with @entity4 's talismanic forward @entity61 ‘ it was an enjoyable team to play in , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ and the fans as well , the way they got behind us in the last few games was brilliant			2
i ’ve never seen anything like it			2
i got real goose bumps			2
’ @entity4 have had their fair share of youthful prodigies , from the over-exposed @entity73 , who joined the squad at 17 in 2006 , to @entity75 , a raw 18 - year - old who lit up the @entity7 in 1998			2
@entity61 also burst on to the world scene at 18 , but that was at the @entity78 in 2004			2
@entity8 approaches this @entity7 with expectations of his experience being more akin to @entity75 ’s than @entity73 ’s , who did n’t play			1
if anyone is likely to shock opponents , it is @entity8			1
‘ now i ’m just working hard , so anything can happen , but i ’m not going to say i ’m going to do amazing things , ’ he said			2
‘ i will give 100 per cent and hopefully what i try will come off and work			2
but i ’m not going to put myself under pressure and say i ’m going to do what @entity75 did			1
i ’m just going to work hard for the team			0
’ even the most confident young prodigy can shrink a little when promoted to the @entity4 squad			0
‘ it ’s a bit nerve - racking , sitting there eating dinner with your new @entity4 team - mates			0
you do n’t want to be too much in someone else ’s zone			0
but i ’ve had a lot of help and advice from the @entity37 lads			0
’ though he was born in @entity106 , @entity107 , he came to @entity108 when he five			0
his initial emergence saw him given an @entity4 cap at 17 , becoming the third youngest after @entity73 and @entity61 since 1881			0
yet the limelight faded as @entity112 demoted him from the first team			0
topping it off nicely : @entity11 celebrates scoring against the @entity13 in 2010 , a goal the 15 - year - old @entity8 watched on tv while eating pizza his life off the pitch was also under scrutiny , a well - established rumour asserting that he had fathered a number of children			1
in reality he has only one daughter , one - year - old @entity125 , although he is no longer with her mother			0
in football terms , it looked as though he might have shone brightly but faded quickly			0
@entity112 ’ restraint paid off in the second half of last season , @entity8 ’s renaissance bringing him back into the national consciousness			1
not only was he key to @entity37 ’s rise , but he was also considered mature enough to play centrally behind the strikers as well as wide right or left			0
‘ it was a new position for me and i had to adapt			0
i think @entity112 mainly put me there to move the ball quicker			1
sometimes i like to stay on the ball a bit too long and i think he put me in there so someone might smash me or something like that ! he put me in there to make sure i play with two touches			1
i played there when i was younger at @entity36 , just behind the striker , and i quite like it			0
’ tactically , he has proved himself adept and @entity112 felt he had grown up enough to describe him as the best young player in @entity151			0
‘ obviously that ’s nice to hear , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ but i try to block it out			0
for a manager like @entity112 to say that is obviously good for me , but i just try to keep level - headed			0
’ he says it is his mother , @entity157 , who keeps him grounded and in the next breath reveals he has moved out to his own place			0
like most teenagers , he doubtless feels ready to take on the world .			0

@entity8 watched @entity11 score vs @entity13 on tv , aged 15
says he has to ' pinch himself ' playing with likes of @entity11 and @entity167
@entity169 urges *people* to not put too much pressure on @entity8
@entity8 says he wo *n't* ' overdo it ' if he gets his chance in @entity175
