travelling to far - flung exotic destinations can be a hugely rewarding experience that many women in the @entity3 take for granted			1
for most , it is an entirely safe and liberating adventure that they will never forget - for all the right reasons			1
but while wolf whistles , cat calls and belligerent taxi drivers may be an annoyance for some solo travellers , there are some countries where women may be exposed to misogyny , pestering and , in some extreme cases , danger			1
@entity39 , co-owner of website the @entity41 , has written extensively on the issue of women 's safety abroad , and believes that honesty is the best policy when it comes to discussing the dangers that solo female travellers face			1
she said : ' i 'm truly appalled at how unsafe and how unfriendly some places are			1
you ca n't even enter some countries if you 're a woman , yet most travel websites just skirt around the issue and prefer to focus on what lipstick a woman should wear			0
' we 're absolutely in favour of women being adventurous and having a great time , but let 's not delude ourselves and say that women are welcome everywhere			0
@entity65 and frequent traveller @entity66 advises female travels to be smart and listen to their gut source : @entity71 ' there 's a big different from going to @entity73 versus @entity74 as a female traveller , at least let 's be honest about what the dangers are			1

' i 've been very fortunate			0
i honestly do n't feel like i 've been anywhere particularly dangerous , but i was definitely more on edge in @entity89 than anywhere else			0
' crime rates are higher there and tourists can be targets for muggings , so i was careful never to carry many valuables and not to be out alone after dark			0
' expat traveller @entity98 now lives in @entity99 and agrees that women have a few extra challenges to deal with than men while travelling , although she says it 's no reason to stay at home			0
' there certainly are places where women are sort of second class citizens , and that can be frustrating			0
but i just try to remember that most people are genuinely nice , and i do my best to dress appropriately so i do n't attract unwanted attention			0
' and if you do travel to danger hot - spots , social media consultant and explorer @entity117 advises against being too forthcoming on when sharing your experiences			2
' be wary of posting real - time updates on social media about where are you in case someone is paying a little too close attention			2
it 's safer to post that awesome photo to @entity128 when you 're on to the next destination , especially if you plan to geo - tag it			1
' and while the instinct is to live - tweet your trip , it may be best to rave ( or rant ) about your accommodations after you have checked out			2
' @entity138 traveller and blogger @entity66 advises female travellers to use their common sense			1
' i would say to women just be smart and listen to your gut			0
do n't do anything you would n't do at home - do n't drink too much alone , do n't go wandering alone at night , do n't go home with strangers , and read up on common scams			2

i know plenty of women who have been there and loved it			0
i just do n't think i could deal with the grabbing and lack of personal space , ' she explains			0
