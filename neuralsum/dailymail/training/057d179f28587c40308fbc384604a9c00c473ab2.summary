by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 has backed his squad to illustrate why they are one of the promotion favourites			1
the @entity3 begin life back in the @entity8 with a trip to @entity13 - last season 's @entity11 champions - on sunday			1
@entity2 was handed the @entity15 post on a permanent basis this summer which brought a mixed reaction from the fans			1
however , his vow to play flowing , attacking football certainly raised his stock following many monotonous displays under previous boss @entity23			2
with playmaker @entity25 signing a new two - year contract this week and the summer captures of @entity27 and @entity28 , goals should not be in short supply , unlike last season			1
performance : @entity2 said @entity3 's performances must live up to people 's expectations this season so far only @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and @entity37 ( on loan to @entity39 ) have departed , with @entity40 - who will be absent at @entity41 following his @entity42 exploits with @entity43 - still being heavily linked with a move			1
@entity2 told the club 's official website : ' we ca n't stop people tipping us to go back up but we have to make sure we go and perform			1
we have to show people we are as good as they think			2
' we have to be ready to handle that along with the other two relegated teams because no one is just going to let us go back up , that is for sure			1
wolves are not going to roll over and let us do what we want to do			0
disappointment : @entity37 signed for the club for close to £ 10m but has been loaned to @entity57 ' we have a good core group who are capable of competing really well in this division			2
the key thing for us is you respect the opposition but they have to respect us equally because we are going to be positive in every game to try and get as many points and victories as possible			0
' to do well in this division you need to score goals but of course that does n't mean you throw caution to the wind and risk losing games before you have a foothold			0
' you have to get the balance with the emphasis on attacking , scoring goals and dominating the ball			0
but you have to be ready to defend as and when because we will be tested			0
' wolves are a good side , well organised , they have a style of play and a philosophy that suits them			0
it will be a tough game but i am anticipating 46 tough ones			0
' wolves : @entity3 's opposition on the first day of the season will be @entity11 champions @entity13 opposite number @entity91 admits an opening - day clash with one of relegated teams from the top - flight is an ideal test for his @entity13 side			1
he told his club 's official website : ' it is a terrific opening game , live on tv and because of what has happened to the clubs in recent seasons and now seeing where they are in this new season and what standard they are at			1
' these are the games we want			0
we want to be in these games , testing ourselves - and we do early on			0
we 've got some really good games			0
' @entity91 should have @entity114 ( groin ) , @entity116 ( back ) and @entity117 ( @entity118 ) available but will be without @entity119 ( fractured metatarsal )			2
