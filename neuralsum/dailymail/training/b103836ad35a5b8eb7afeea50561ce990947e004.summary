@entity7 players , as well as @entity144 and his coaching staff were incensed though , after what looked like a clear foul on @entity55 from @entity181 in the build up to the goal			0
opposite number @entity18 was equally frustrated 10 minutes later after he felt his side should have been awarded a penalty after goalscorer @entity1 went down under the challenge of @entity50			0
