a @entity1 family claims they were banned from boarding a plane and left stranded in @entity4 for two days after their autistic 11 - year - old son was deemed ' unfit to fly ' by tour operator @entity7			1
@entity9 and @entity10 said they were told that their son , @entity12 , was not allowed to board the plane at @entity15 , even though they had already checked in , because he was a ' safety risk ' and they did not have a ' fit to fly ' certificate from a doctor			1
they were forced to remain in the country , along with their 19 - year - old daughter , @entity23 , until they obtained the document and a doctor prescribed anti-anxiety drugs for @entity12 's journey home to @entity30			1
@entity9 ( right ) and @entity10 said their 11 - year - old son , @entity12 , was not allowed to board the family spent £ 2,300 on the @entity7 package holiday to the @entity36 and has been offered an apology and £ 750 in compensation from the @entity40 - based tour operator			1
they were left feeling angry and embarrassed after they were turned away at the gate and forced to spend an additional £ 300 on a hotel , food and taxis while they obtained the certificate during their getaway last july			1
@entity12 's 41 - year - old father and full - time caregiver , @entity9 , said : ' they told us we needed a doctor 's note to allow him to fly from the airport and were asked to sit in another area while we watched all the other passengers board the plane			1
' someone from @entity7 told us that they had spoken to the pilot who had refused to let my son on the plane to fly home			1
they said @entity12 was a safety risk and was not fit to fly			1
@entity12 , pictured with his mother , has severe autism and uses sign language to communicate ' we could n't understand			1
i had notified @entity7 before the holiday about my son 's disability			1
the only thing i could think of was that he had a small tantrum on the flight on the way out			0
' @entity12 , who communicates through sign language , became stressed during the flight to @entity4 and banged on a toilet door , but was calmed down by his father			1
@entity9 described it as ' a long day ' as the family had missed its flight from @entity88 and had to return to @entity1 for another flight			1
he said : ' my son had been awake a long time and was tired			2
it was the only reason i could think of why they were n't letting him fly			0
' the family were left feeling angry after they were turned away at the gate at @entity4 's @entity15 after they were turned away in @entity15 they tried to see the airport doctor but were referred to a local hospital			1
they were offered an ambulance but were told that they would be billed for the ride			0
@entity9 said : ' they strapped my son to a stretcher and we were all sitting in the back of the ambulance			1
it just did n't feel right			0
i did n't have any faith in what was going on			0
i saw a taxi pull up and put my family in the taxi instead			0
' after obtaining the certificate and anti-anxiety medication the family had to wait 40 hours for the next flight back to the @entity122			1
when they returned to @entity15 , however , neither the airport nor @entity7 asked to see the document , said @entity9			1
' after all of that they never asked to see the letter			0
our week - long holiday , which had been so lovely , ended in a nightmare			0
' @entity12 had never taken any medication like that before			1
we had to trust what they had given him			0
' we have always tried to make his life as enjoyable and normal as possible			0
we have travelled to @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and the @entity139 , but have never been treated like this			0
' a @entity7 spokesman said the company takes the welfare and safety of its customers ' very seriously ' , and that the decision to seek a certificate from a medical professional rested with @entity149 , a company it contracts			2
the tour operator told @entity153 : ' prior to their return flight , the company we use for medical assistance advised that @entity155 and mrs @entity157 's son would need to be seen by a doctor before flying home to ensure he was well enough for the flight			2
' our crew explained this to the family and we ensured they were able to travel to the hospital			2
they returned to the @entity122 on our flight the next day at no cost and we also ensured they had support and welfare at the airport			2
' our customer services team are now liaising directly with the family to ensure they are compensated for the additional expenses they incurred and we 'd like to apologise for any confusion caused during their holiday			0
' at all times , our concern was for the health of @entity183			0
' @entity184 , director of the @entity186 ’s @entity185 , said a ‘ fit to fly ’ certificate is nothing but an inconvenience for families and could put more stress on the child			2
she told @entity153 : ‘ people with autism and their families want to access the same opportunities most of us take for granted , and this includes holidays and travel			0
‘ but many rely on routines to make sense of an often confusing world and can find the busy and unpredictable airport and plane environment distressing and disorientating			0
‘ we struggle to see what difference a ' fit - to - fly ' certificate could make to these issues , apart from create an inconvenience which could in itself create more stress for the individual and their family			2
’ she said airports and airlines can make a difference by helping to prepare a child or adult with autism for their journey so they know what to expect and understand that there could be delays or cancellations			0
‘ by making small adjustments , they can help build familiarity with the airport process and environment , for instance by having easily accessible information on their websites			0
‘ staff at every stage of the flight process , from check - in to arrival at their destination , should be aware of autism so they can notice if a passenger is feeling distressed and offer appropriate support and advice			0
‘ this type of preparation and support from airports and airlines can prevent other families from having to go through the type of stress and inconvenience experienced by @entity12 and his family			2
