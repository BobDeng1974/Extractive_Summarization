by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 01:40 est , 8 august 2012 @entity1 came the torrential weather , then the floods			2
now residents living near the @entity5 say they are facing a new problem - a plague of mosquitoes			1
the insects are are the latest blight on the flood - ravaged @entity5			1
one man has even been driven to invest in that staple of @entity15 exploration , the mosquito net , to get a good night ’s sleep			2
@entity18 says he has been forced to sleep with mosquito net after he was bitten between 30 and 40 times in one night a mosquito on a wall in @entity23 , where recent bad weather has boosted the numbers of the tiny biting insects @entity18 lives at @entity27 where the flooded rivers @entity28 and @entity30 spread silt and rotting weed over hundreds of acres of land			2
he is one of many bitten by the insects which have hatched in hordes			2
he said : ' when we travel abroad to hot places we expect the occasional bite but this is exceptional			2
i woke up one morning with 30 - 40 bites on my legs			1
' we have tried various sprays but they do n’t exactly do much for your breathing			0
a mosquito net over the bed at night was the answer and it ’s proving effective			0
' nearby at @entity50 beef and dairy farmer @entity48 lives near 90 acres of land which could be the cause of mr @entity18 ’s problem			1
mr @entity18 said a mosquito net is the only way he can get a good night 's sleep he and eight other local farmers are among dozens across the levels are still struggling to feed livestock as hundreds of acres lie covered in silt , tree trunks and rotting weed nine weeks after floods first hit			0
mr @entity48 said : ' some years ago they had a maintenance programme to desilt the rivers but it does n’t happen now			0
' the @entity67 and the @entity69 and @entity70 river , which is called the @entity71 need to be dredged			0
' they have trimmed the river , but they do n’t desilt			0
' @entity72 is financed by @entity73 and they say they have n’t been given the money			1
' we know the land will flood but unless the rivers are desilted the water ca n’t be carried away quickly enough			0
' now we ’ve got a thick black carpet of silt and debris			0
' there are millions of mosquitoes and they carry disease such as @entity86			1
flooding in the @entity5 , which includes the @entity28 ( pictured ) has led to conditions described as an ' ecological disaster ' ' in the past we have been highly commended in the @entity90 awards and our land is really rich in wildlife species but they have been destroyed			1
' @entity94 and @entity23 mp @entity95 said the @entity96 , the @entity97 had created an ecological disaster			0
he said @entity73 should fund @entity72 dredging of rivers and he called for machines currently at work on a £ 29 million scheme to create major new intertidal wetland for wildlife on the @entity107 coast , and protect the hamlet of @entity109 to be diverted to the @entity58			1
he claimed @entity110 , minister for the @entity111 , had done nothing to help farmers and called on him to wake up and smell the problem			2
an @entity72 spokesman said : ' mosquito numbers fluctuate naturally year on year for a variety of reasons , such as temperature			1
anecdotal evidence suggests the number of mosquitoes on the @entity5 has increased this year			1
' @entity72 teams are working to remove all the remaing flood water from the @entity5 , and expect pumping operations to be complete by the end of the week			1
' we spend some £ 20 million annually on dredging in @entity128 and @entity129			0
in many cases , however , dredging will not reduce the risk of flooding , simply because many rivers quickly silt up again as part of their natural processes			0
we therefore focus our efforts on dredging at those locations where it has a proven benefit of reducing flood risk			0
' a @entity73 spokesman said : ' we are spending more than £ 2.1 billion on flood risk management , and are on course to exceed our goal to better protect 145,000 homes by march 2015			0
' @entity72 has pumped 11 million cubic metres of water from the moors near the towns of @entity150 and @entity94 this year alone			1
' we are doing all we can to keep the rivers in @entity23 clear but dredging does not reduce the risk of flooding because rivers quickly silt up again naturally			0
' a coalition of farmers , environmentalists and local authorities has been set up to address the problems faced on the @entity5			1
@entity160 , who is heading up the coalition in his role as chairman of @entity164 , said : ' this must serve as a wake - up call to all concerned as to the damage which is caused if sufficient resources are not made available to manage water on the one hand , and to maintain the delicate balance between farming and wildlife on the other			2
