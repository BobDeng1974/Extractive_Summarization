the scandal of mps enjoying extravagant expenses might seem like an indictment of the modern politician			0
but the identity of the very first commoners sent to @entity7 can be revealed by a new book only because they too pocketed public money for their time and travel more than 700 years ago			1
and the desperate scrabble of today 's politicians to submit claims is also centuries old , with @entity7 inundated with hundreds of complaints for not paying out enough			2
this is one of the earliest parliamentary expense claims , dating from 1309 , and paid out to @entity17 , who also attended the first @entity7 in 1258 king @entity18 ordered that four knights from every county , and six from @entity21 , attend the first parliament in the mid- 13th century , @entity18 was forced to accept a new form of government and agreed under the so - called @entity25 to convene a king ’s council to deal with affairs of the realm and ‘ legitimate local grievances ’			1
he ordered that knights from different parts of the country would report back to a @entity7 on problems they had come across			1
in all 150 knights were appointed , four from each county and six from @entity21			1
some were too ill to travel , others were deemed ‘ not fit ’ and replaced			0
but records unearthed by @entity41 mp @entity40 show that at least 14 did attend the very first ‘ parliament ’ in @entity44 in 1258 – and they all claimed expenses			1
in an eerie echo of the 2009 scandal that rocked @entity7 , the expenses offered were over generous to make sure the @entity1 turned up			2
knights were offered 4 shillings - a - day , including for their travel from every corner of the country - twice the rate for going to war			1
the first @entity7 came about after @entity18 was forced by his barons to implement the @entity25 according to @entity40 's research , at least 14 names were record on the very first expense claim for attending @entity7 in october 1258			1
they were : according to mr @entity40 ’s new book , @entity7 : the biography , the names on the claims include @entity17 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
the details were revealed in the ‘ partially illegible gall - spattered @entity69 of november 1258 show that the “ reasonable expenses of coming and returning ” to the @entity76 council were met for the knights from at least ten counties ’			2
mr @entity40 said : ‘ i started this book because i wanted to know who the very first commoners were who came to @entity7 – people whose names we have and know they actually attended			1
‘ i found a list in the @entity86 , it ’s all on velum , from october 1258			0
‘ that has 14 names of people coming from @entity91 , @entity21 and so on			2
the only reason we know they came is because they had their expenses paid			0
’ @entity97 ’s oldest expenses form was also unearthed , dating from 1309 , which included claims by @entity100 , and @entity17 , who appears to have claimed for several decades			1
' the king was so keen to have impressive and important knights to come to @entity7 that whereas he would pay two shillings to go to war , he paid four shillings for coming to @entity7 each day , including every day they were travelling			1
that was quite a hefty amount in those days			0
‘ from 1377 to 1505 there were 119 disputed cases , mainly where people were n’t pay what they should have been paid			0
’ the successor body , the @entity113 , is still bombarded with complaints from @entity1 today about their claims			0
they can still claim for rail , road and air travel , including being reimbursed for cycling on official duties			0
but since the 2009 scandal they are no longer able to claim for mortgages , extravagant shopping sprees on furniture or eating out when @entity7 is sitting			2
@entity41 mp @entity40 unearthed the very first expense claims while researching his book @entity7 : a biography by @entity40 a highly significant provision of the @entity131 settlement was that the king ’s council would deal not only with affairs ‘ of the realm and of the king ’ , but also with legitimate local grievances			1
to this end the @entity131 council resolved that knights ( rather than magnates or clerics ) be appointed to investigate problems in each county and report back to ‘ parliament ’ later in the year			0
so , on 4 august 1258 , @entity18 wrote to the sheriffs of the thirty - seven counties of @entity148 , sending to each a list of local knights from which a number were to be chosen ‘ to enquire touching excesses , trespasses and injuries committed in that county , and to bring their inquisition personally to @entity156 by the octave of @entity76 , for delivery to the council ’			1
in all bar one county four knights were nominated , but for @entity21 there were six , giving a neat total of 150			0
not all those originally summoned were to make it to @entity156			0
@entity167 ( no relation to @entity169 ) , who had presided over the @entity131 meeting , sent word that three of the @entity174 knights were ‘ not fit ’ ; so they were replaced			0
and when the sheriff of @entity176 pointed out that two of his were sick he was allowed to appoint substitutes			0
we can , however , be certain that some of them did attend the parliament , for the partially illegible gall - spattered @entity69 of november 1258 show that the ‘ reasonable expenses of coming and returning ’ to the @entity76 council were met for the knights from at least ten counties			2
in the cases of @entity190 and @entity191 the knights who attended are named – and are the same as those summoned in august			0
a further seven counties ’ knights seem to have arrived later , as their expenses were also met , and again in the case of @entity198 the names of the attendant knights are the same as those summoned .			2

king @entity18 ordered 150 knights to convene first ' parliament ' in 1258
names of 14 who attended can be revealed because they claimed expenses
new book includes a *scrawled* expenses form dating from 1309
knights received 4 shillings a day , double what they got for going to war
