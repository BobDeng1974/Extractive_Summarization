a post about domestic violence against men on the @entity3 page has sparked outrage and heated debate from commenters about the timing and nature of the comments			1
the post - which was uploaded on monday - shows a picture of a man with a black eye while the accompanying text explains that one in five victims of domestic violence are men			1
since then it has attracted over 12,000 likes , more than 1300 comments and has been shared on @entity3 almost 3000 times			2
but the debate quickly turned sour with many pointing out that the upload was ill - timed in light of the murder of @entity26 woman @entity25 allegedly at the hands of her estranged husband			1
there has also been outrage about the number of abusive and offensive comments which had been left up on the thread			0
the windows breaking , ' the post on the @entity45 began			0
' you see the bruises			0
the look of fear in the children ’s eyes			0
' the police are called			0
' but do n’t assume you know how this story ends.because she is the one who is arrested			0
and he is the innocent victim			0

domestic violence does not discriminate			1
' last year , 1 in every 5 domestic violence assaults that @entity62 responded to involving intimate partners were for male victims			1
' the @entity62 has zero tolerance for domestic violence			1
you make the call - we ’ll make it stop , ' it concluded			0
the post is part of an ongoing campaign by @entity62 against domestic violence			1
many people have weighed into the debate with offensive and inappropriate comments , none of which appear to have been moderated a vast number have criticised the move in light of @entity25 's stabbing murder , which her husband has been charged for , saying women are still disproportionately affected by domestic violence ms @entity25 's husband @entity85 has been charged with her murder and refused bail since it was published thousands of people from all around the country have weighed into the debate , with some calling the police out for the poor timing of the post , to others praising them for shedding light on the issue			1
the thread also had people blaming women for any violence brought on them , accusing police of favouring women , even if they are the abuser , while other said they expected more from the police in light of recent events			1
these events include the murder of @entity26 woman @entity25 , who was found dead in her car in the western suburbs just days ago			2
her husband @entity85 , 33 , who police allege ' has physically assaulted his wife in the past , with incidents not reported ' , has been charged with her murder			1
ms @entity25 is said to have had an @entity113 against @entity85 , but despite this he still allegedly murdered her with a pair of scissors			1
others made the point that domestic violence is largely a gendered issue , the same stance taken by @entity122 whose son @entity123 was murdered by his father many brought up the plight of @entity127 , an apprentice hairdresser from western @entity26 @entity122 - whose son @entity123 was murdered by his father - has condemned the post by @entity62 branding it ' a shame ' and ' disappointing ' all the comments and the full post by @entity62 have been left up and do not appear to have been monitored			1
' if a girl can throw a punch , she can taken one ' , one commenter wrote , while another said they were disappointed by the statement from @entity62			2
' i expected better from @entity62			2
81 women died in @entity140 last year at the hands of their male partners or exes ...			2
a woman had her throat cut in a car park the other day			0
thousands more women beaten every day by men			2
go check the stats ' , the post read in part			2
@entity122 - a vocal advocate against domestic violence since her young son @entity123 was beaten to death by his father - said she was extremely disappointed with @entity62 's stance			1
' it 's absolutely a gendered issue and i 'm really disappointed , ' she told @entity159			0
' we do need to acknowledge that it 's not all men and its not all women but the key statistics are very clear			2
this commenter maintained that the perpetrators were very rarely women in such cases others sided with the police welcoming the important conversation despite the context some shared their experiences as a male dealing with domestic violence ' it is one woman a week that 's being killed ... the statistics are overwhelming			1
' ms @entity122 acknowledged while the point of violence against men was a valid one , in light of the death of @entity25 it was ' a real shame ' and reinforced that domestic violence is an issue that affects disproportionately more women than men			1
' if we 're not approaching violence from that perspective ... it seem to me that it 's disappointing there 's not a consistent message , ' she said , before adding that nonetheless it 's a very important conversation to be having			0
detective superintendent @entity200 , who is the @entity202 sponsor , said the single image was part of campaign of five different posters but admitted the timing was unfortunate			2
' we knew that there would be conversation but this @entity3 post is part of a large campaign we commenced back before @entity212 , ' mr @entity200 told @entity159			1
' we know that domestic violence and family violence rises significantly at this time of year			2
' mr @entity200 descibed the death of @entity25 as an ' absolute tragedy ' but added : ' if people had been watching the campaign roll out i do n't think anything would have happened '			0
@entity221 asked about the rate of @entity223 which are breached in @entity36 per year - nearly half - mr @entity200 described the figure as ' very disappointing '			0
as for the unfortunate timing and abuse on the @entity3 post he said the campaign needs to be looked at as part of a wider initiative			1
' we certainly demonstrate that we look at all victims equally , but we do acknowledge that 80 percent of the victims are women			0
' this commenter provided one of the most level - headed responses to the situation while some added nothing to the conversation other commenters on the post also brought up that while one in five domestic violence victims may be men , that does not necessarily mean it is at the hands of women			1
' 1 in every 5 men ... this includes gay relationships where men hit their male partners ... very rare to be a woman ! ' one person claimed			0
' as someone who was beaten and raped many times by my ex boyfriend , it 's good an empowering to finally see a post like this ' , one man commented			0
the debate about men breaking @entity267 was also aired , in reference to statistics which claim nearly have of them in @entity36 alone are breached			0
' while this is acknowledged , sadly it is still males that are breaking @entity276 with at times impunity as as recently seen killing their ex-partners , ' one woman wrote .			0
