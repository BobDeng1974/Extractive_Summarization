by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the co-op ’s dramatic decline is ‘ one of the great national business calamities ’ but its leaders are still in denial , a damning report into its failings warned today			1
former @entity11 minister @entity10 said half of the group ’s net worth , built up over 150 years , has been wiped out in just four disastrous years			1
unveiling his plans to rescue the co-op , he said it could yet be saved but he was not confident that bosses will take the action needed , claiming some on the board do not know the difference between credit and debit			1
the collapse of the co-op bank has added to the financial woes of the ailing mutual the ailing mutual last month reported annual losses of £ 2.5 billion , and has been dogged by rows over the way it is run			1
to add to the sense of crisis , the former co-op bank chief @entity33 is due in court today charged with possessing drugs including cocaine and crystal meth			1
the minister , dubbed the crystal methodist , will appear at @entity42 following his arrest in the @entity45 area last year			2
@entity33 , 63 , stepped down as the bank 's chairman in june amid claims of illegal drug use and inappropriate expenses payments			1
last month a major review found a merger between the co-op bank and the @entity54 should never have happened			1
the problems at the bank have added to the financial woes of the entire group , which former chief executive @entity59 branded ‘ ungovernable ’			1
former @entity11 minister @entity10 said the co-op could yet be saved , but he is not confident its leaders will take the necessary action today @entity10 called for the abolition of the group 's 21 - member board to be replaced by a slimmed - down body to take commercial decisions			1
the idea will be put before the co-op 's @entity70 in @entity72 on may 17 but regional membership boards and independent societies that currently hold sway in the group are reported to be unhappy about the proposals			2
in a damning verdict , @entity10 said : ‘ the co-op has lost half its net worth – net worth accumulated over 150 years – in the last four years			1
‘ we ’re talking about circa £ 3.5billion of erosion of wealth over a period of four or five years , ’ he told @entity82 ’s today programme			2
‘ this makes it one of the great national business calamities			0
and it ’s been led by a board totally unable , because of a lack of experience , to hold the executive to account			0
’ the report comes days after the running of the food - to - funerals mutual was sharply criticised in a review by sir @entity98 into the near - collapse of its banking arm - a report which backed the need for change			2
the bank faced near - collapse last year after the discovery of a £ 1.5 billion hole in its balance sheet , and had to be rescued by bondholders in a move that saw the group 's stake reduced from 100 % to 30 %			1
@entity10 , who recently resigned as a director after just four months , said that the 15 lay directors on the current board were drawn from a total eligible pool of only 35 regional board members			2
they include an engineer , a plasterer and a retired deputy head teacher			0
he said : ' effective organisations , undoubtedly , tend to have a strong managerial presence , but it ’s never down to one woman or one man ; it ’s down to an accountable and experienced board who hold that executive to an agreed strategy and have the right knowledge to ask the right questions			0
' the co-op board tends not to ask the right questions because the people around the board table do n’t know the difference , in some cases , between a debit and a credit			0
' he said that apart from the lack of relevant skills and experience , ‘ this has not even been genuine democracy at work ’			0
@entity10 said : ‘ radical decisions on governance structure need to be taken very soon - and with resolution - if the co-op , as my mother knew it , is to be saved			1
‘ the decision lies in the hands of the elected democrats			0
i have done all i can do			0
’ @entity155 boss @entity33 is due in court today charged with possessing drugs including cocaine and crystal meth the former chairman of @entity161 added : ‘ i have no doubt that the @entity163 can over the next five years reverse a decline that started over 50 years ago			1
but i am less confident that it will choose to do so			0
‘ much will depend on the small number of ' elected democrats ' , less than one in 10,000 of the group 's entire membership			0
‘ will they put their self - interest to one side for the greater good , acknowledging the collective failure of the current board and the crippling deficiencies of the entire governance system ? ’ ‘ i would say that the group board and many on the regional boards are still stuck in denial over this near ruinous failure of governance , whereas the vast majority of ordinary members feel justified anger			0
’ @entity10 said the resistance from traditionalists reflected a culture of entitlement within a small but highly active proportion of the membership			2
he added : ‘ this has undoubtedly created strong vested interests and a reluctance to rethink existing ways of doing things			0
‘ i have myself witnessed repeated instances where there has been denial of responsibility , corrosive suspicion , deliberate delay and a practice of hiding behind ' values ' in order to deflect or stifle criticism and protect self - interest			0
’ @entity207 , chairman of the @entity163 , said a resolution containing four key principles on reform will be put to members at the agm			0
@entity213 's largest union unite described the report as the ‘ only game in town ’ , which could deliver a future for the group and its workforce			2
