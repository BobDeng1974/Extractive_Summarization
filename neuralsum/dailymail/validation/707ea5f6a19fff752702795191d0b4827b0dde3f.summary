the battery of an underwater locator beacon had run out more than a year before flight mh370 disappeared , a report by investigators revealed today			1
the update on the progress of the probe surrounding the @entity9 plane - which vanished a year ago today - indicates those looking for the aircraft would have had less chance of finding it			1
the plane , which was travelling from @entity15 to @entity16 , went missing with 239 people on board on march 8 , 2014 - and a huge search in the @entity20 has so far proved fruitless			1
one year on : family members of passengers missing on @entity24 shout at police officers who tried to move journalists away from a protest near the @entity29 embassy in @entity16 today emotional : a @entity31 relative of a missing passenger on @entity24 weeps outside the main gate of the @entity34 in @entity16 today sadness : a relative of @entity24 passengers holds a sign reading ' @entity39 i miss @entity41 !

the significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent , except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane , even if they were in its vicinity			2
the report said : ‘ the sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents , and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability			2
’ whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the @entity98 , the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working			2
standing together : relatives of @entity24 passengers attend an event today marking the one - year anniversary of its disappearance in @entity15 , @entity29 calling for their return : the brother of a missing passenger writes a message during the @entity15 event memories : two @entity31 people hold a picture of their son , an @entity24 passenger , during the event in @entity29 remembered : @entity118 , four , holds a picture of her grandmother @entity121 and her aunt @entity122 who were aboard @entity24 , in @entity15 today ordeal : a @entity31 relative of a missing passenger on @entity24 cries as she sits on the curb outside the @entity127 in @entity16 the two instruments are critical in any crash because they record cockpit conversation and flight data , leading up to the end of the flight			1

@entity256 , whose mother @entity257 was on the plane , said : ‘ it is important to highlight to the public that we still do n't have any answers and that we must pursue the search			1
’ the @entity29 prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found			2
@entity266 said : ‘ the lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear			0
‘ together with our international partners , we have followed the little evidence that exists			0
@entity29 remains committed to the search , and hopeful that @entity24 will be found			2
’ while the country 's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident , and said all those on board are presumed dead , relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers			1

no way though : a journalist ( right ) is blocked by @entity31 police outside @entity34 after prayers in @entity16 a relative of a @entity31 passenger from @entity24 shows a poster saying ' bring the @entity24 passengers home ' moving away : @entity31 police block journalists with cameras filming relatives of @entity24 passengers in @entity16 talking : a relative of a @entity31 passenger from @entity24 speaks to the foreign media outside the @entity34 these showed nothing unusual except for the one previously undisclosed fact of the battery 's expiry date			1
it said that according to maintenance records , the battery on the beacon attached to the @entity98 expired in december 2012			0
‘ there is some extra margin in the design to account for battery life variabilty and ensure that the unit will meet the minimum requirement , ’ it said			0
‘ however , once beyond the expiry date , the ( battery 's ) effectiveness decreases so it may operate , for a reduced time period until it finally discharges , ’ the report said			2
