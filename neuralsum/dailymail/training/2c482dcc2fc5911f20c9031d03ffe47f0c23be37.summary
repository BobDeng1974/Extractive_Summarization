a new @entity13 report reveals that a shocking 30.5 per cent of women in @entity15 continued to smoke into the last three months of their pregnancy			1
@entity19 , on the other hand , had one of the lowest smoking rates , with just 2.3 per cent of pregnant women admitting to the hazardous activity			1
