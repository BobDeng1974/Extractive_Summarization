@entity19 also said that while the truck was n't stuck in the way that vehicles sometimes get trapped between railroad crossing safety arms , investigators have not ruled out that the truck was somehow stranded and will determine why it traveled 80 feet down the tracks and remained there with its parking brake engaged			2

attorney @entity90 told reporters that the crash was an accident and his client left the scene trying to look for help before eventually finding police			1
' the reality is he basically freaked out trying to help people , ' @entity90 said			2
' did he do everything like @entity101 ? no , he did the best he could			0
' he said @entity0 made repeated attempts to get the vehicle off the rails and then ran for his life as the train approached			2
@entity0 accidentally drove onto the tracks and made the situation worse by continuing forward in an attempt to get enough speed to get his wide pickup over the rails , @entity90 said			2
when that effort failed , he tried to push the truck and then fled before the impact			0
' he hits his high beams trying to do something			0
he realizes , ' i ca n't do anything , ' and then he tries to run so he does n't get killed , ' @entity90 said			0

' when someone goes through a huge trauma like that and not only thinking they almost died , but they think other people are dead and you do n't know what to do and you 're confused ... what is a normal reaction to such an event ? ' @entity90 said			0
police said @entity0 did not call 911 and made no immediate effort to call for help			0
but @entity90 said @entity0 , who does n't speak @entity154 well , tried to get help from a passerby , tried calling his employer and eventually reached his son to help him speak with police			0

the crossing has been the scene of many crashes over the years			0

@entity24 spokesman @entity230 said the @entity50 crash showed the technology worked			1
' safe to say it would have been much worse without it , ' he said			0
