from cold - calling chancers flogging non-existent shares to smooth - talking salesmen convincing you to plough thousands of pounds into dodgy property schemes , criminals never miss an opportunity to tap into an age - old instinct — the desire to get rich quickly			2
the financial losses to individuals can be huge — anywhere between £ 10,000 to as much as £ 1 million , according to @entity17 , the national fraud and internet crime centre			1
fraudsters scam trusting investors out of more than £ 1.2 billion every year			1
one of the tricks involves cold - calling chancers flogging non-existent shares ( file photo ) often the scams start small , asking for as little as £ 500 of your cash just to ‘ see how it goes ’			1
then , after fictitious updates suggesting explosive profits and huge gains , duped investors hand over even greater sums			1
only when promised returns fail to materialise does the penny drop			2
the personal impact of fraud can hit victims even harder than the financial blow			1
many are too embarrassed to tell anyone , and suffer stress from worrying about the fallout			2
it ’s estimated that nine in ten cases go unreported , according to the @entity47 regulator , the @entity48 ( @entity48 )			1
but the heartbreak and financial headaches can be avoided			1
never give out any personal information — especially not your bank details — to any individual or company over the phone before you ’ve checked their credentials			1
after fictitious updates suggesting explosive profits and huge gains , duped investors hand over greater sums			1
only when promised returns fail to materialise does the penny drop ( file photo ) be especially wary of post , phone calls or emails offering you business deals out of the blue			2
if an offer seems too good to be true , it probably is			2
you can report a scam and get advice about protecting yourself by calling @entity17 , the national crime centre backed by the government on 0300 123 2040			1
to help alert you , here are three of the biggest investment frauds : @entity81 never sell on an increasingly common scam is run by conmen who buy a huge plot of land and slice it up into smaller plots , which they sell on to individual investors			1
the idea is that investors are snapping up wonderful real estate that will increase in value and be sold at a substantial profit			1
investors are convinced to buy without even seeing the plot or conducting a survey			1
but in reality the plots generally ca n’t be built on — instead , they might be sites of historic or natural interest or , in one example , include a 45 - degree slope with no access			2
in some cases , the land does not even exist			1
the @entity48 estimates investors have lost £ 200 million to these so - called ‘ land - banking ’ scams			1
@entity107 , head of investigations at the @entity109 , says : ‘ companies deliberately mislead the public and ruin the lives of honest people			2
‘ our investigators are tracking down these con artists and stopping them from trading , but new firms pop up immediately offering the same false investment opportunities			2
’ carbon credits that are just thin air one of the latest cons is run by dodgy salesmen who promise huge returns from investing in green schemes , known as carbon credits			0
the idea is that ordinary investors will be able to profit from companies that have to be more environmentally friendly to keep down pollution			1
these types of firms need to buy carbon credits — essentially certificates giving them permission to pump one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere			0
because all companies have targets for the amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit , the big polluters need to buy carbon credits to offset the extra they create			0
the carbon credit certificates are generated by companies that use less than their allowance or are particularly environmentally friendly			0
potential investors are lured by reports that trading carbon credits may become increasingly profitable in future years			1
as more companies will need to offset the pollution they cause , so the value of the carbon credits will go up			0
but carbon credit schemes are essentially buying nothing but thin air — there is nothing tangible to invest in			0
though there are plenty of legitimate companies offering access to such schemes , many others are fraudulent and trying their luck with cold calls — and promises of windfalls			0
the @entity48 is worried about the promise of returns and is sceptical that anyone has ever made money			0
@entity175 , head of unauthorised business at the @entity48 , says : ‘ we have yet to see any convincing evidence to indicate that investors can make money from investing in carbon credits			1
’ so far , the regulator has launched 77 inquiries into carbon credit firms and recently added a further 13 to its warning list			1
boiler rooms that sell fake shares despite continued crackdowns , huge numbers of investors still lose money to so - called boiler room scams			2
with these , a person is called at home by a salesman and persuaded to buy shares in a company			0
they are told that the firm , which is often based overseas and has a professional - sounding name , is about to make huge profits			0
this could be because they are about to list on a stock exchange , be bought out by a bigger company or , in the case of engineering firms , have just discovered oil or another mineral deposit somewhere around the globe			0
the fake stockbroker — who is usually calling from another country — then pressures you into making a quick decision to avoid missing out on the deal			0
but , in reality , what you are buying are shares in small firms which are difficult to sell or sometimes do n’t even exist			0
the returns never appear and once you start to ask questions , the brokers will suddenly stop returning your calls			0
@entity225 and @entity226 , pictured , were nearly duped by a pushy cold - caller representing a carbon credit firm retiree @entity229 had a narrow escape when he nearly handed over £ 2,500 of his hard - earned cash to a pushy cold - caller representing a carbon credit firm			2
mr @entity229 ( pictured with his wife @entity234 ) was shocked at how much the salesman , called @entity236 , seemed to know about him			0
‘ i have no idea how he got hold of my number and details			0
he knew i had enough money to invest and that i had solar panels on my roof so was obviously interested in green issues			0
’ ‘ @entity236 ’ told mr @entity229 that if he sent a cheque for £ 2,500 he could ‘ get in on the ground floor of an exciting investment ’ and earn back eight times that in just two years			2
@entity236 said the money would buy him carbon credits that other companies would need in the future to offset their carbon footprint			0
there would even be an opportunity to invest more down the line			0
mr @entity229 , who lives in @entity257 , said the exaggerated return was a red flag for him			0
but after he said he was n’t interested , @entity236 still called back and even tried to go through mrs @entity226 , a retired @entity260 worker .			0
