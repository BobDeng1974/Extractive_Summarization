by @entity0 , deputy political editor planning minister @entity1 told members of the @entity3 that quiet villages ' need some noise ' planning minister @entity1 was branded a liar and a fool by countryside campaigners yesterday as he renewed calls to build homes on greenfield land			1
members of the @entity3 repeatedly heckled mr @entity1 and walked out as he told them those who resist house building will condemn rural villages to being ‘ museum exhibits ’			1
the minister claimed quiet villages ‘ need some noise ’ in the form of younger people or they will ‘ become fossilised ’ or ‘ embalmed ’			1
the group ’s annual meeting turned ugly when mr @entity1 rejected @entity3 members ’ claims that developers are to blame for the housing crisis by refusing to build on 400,000 plots that have planning permission			1
but the minister insisted it was the failure to release enough land in the countryside for development which was the problem			2
several @entity3 members repeatedly yelled ‘ it ’s not true ’ and two stormed out of the meeting in central @entity34 , accusing mr @entity1 of failing to listen to their objections			1
@entity37 , chairman of the @entity3 ’s @entity39 branch , left saying : ‘ i ’ve had enough because the man does n’t even understand what planning is about			2
he knows nothing about planning			2
the man ’s a fool			0
’ a second angry member accused the minister of ‘ not listening ’ and another yelled that he was being ‘ so simplistic ’			1
mr @entity1 lost his temper with the audience as he explained that of the 400,000 empty plots identified by the @entity51 , only 126,000 are private developments that lie empty – the rest have building under way or are owned by housing associations			1
he accused the @entity3 members of peddling ‘ red herrings ’			0
repeatedly banging his fist , he said : ‘ if you want to just trade in urban myths , fine			0
but i believe that a government minister has a duty to deal in facts			0
’ @entity3 president sir @entity64 – the former poet laureate – branded the minister ‘ @entity66 ’ and said he ‘ does a great harm ’ to the countryside by refusing to admit that brownfield land is better suited to development than greenfield sites			2
‘ he leapfrogs brownfield sites and lands with a bricky crunch in the open countryside			0
he speaks up for greenfield housing estates rather than the green fields themselves , ’ sir @entity64 said			0
former poet laureate and @entity3 president sir @entity64 called the minister ' @entity66 '			0
he said mr @entity1 ' does a great harm ' to the countryside @entity84 , @entity3 chief executive , accused mr @entity1 of behaving ‘ like a @entity88 tsar ’ by accepting assurances from @entity91 officials that the planning system is working , rather than getting out around the country to see for himself – a charge the minister rejected			1
but mr @entity1 warned that failure to release land for development would leave the young unable to afford homes in rural areas			1
‘ in @entity104 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , the @entity103 and the @entity99 some villages are inches away from becoming forever fossilised , ’ he said			0
‘ their houses are so greatly prized by holidaymakers and those who have recently retired that young people working on nearby farms , local plumbers and carpenters and gardeners … ca n’t afford even the tiniest property			0
’ he added that instead of complaining , @entity3 members should identify ‘ ordinary fields ’ near roads where development can take place and called on councils to ‘ identify the land that could take more houses ’ .			0

planning minister @entity1 said resisting new builds would turn rural villages into ' museum exhibits '
campaigners said developers are to blame for housing crisis by refusing to build on 400,000 available plots
meeting turned angry with campaigners accusing mr @entity1 of having a ' simplistic ' approach and ' not listening '
