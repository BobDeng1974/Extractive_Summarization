by @entity1 reporter restoring lost senses to amputees is something that has , until now , only been considered as science fiction			1
but @entity6 from @entity7 is living proof that working appendages can reinstate senses as complicated as ' feeling '			1
the incredible technology , revealed by @entity11 last year , is the first bionic hand that allows the user to feel the sensation of touch though the device			1
the 36 - year - old was fitted with the robotic limb , known as @entity19 , in @entity20 on january 26 2013 but the medical breakthrough has only now been shared			1
@entity6 of @entity7 ( left ) has become the first amputee to be fitted with a bionic hand ( right ) that allows him to feel what he is touching in a groundbreaking medical procedure ' the sensory feedback was incredible , ' said mr @entity6 , who spent a month trying out the hand			1
' i could feel things that i had n't been able to feel in over nine years			2
' when i held an object , i could feel if it was soft or hard , round or square			2
' mr @entity6 had his hand blown off in an horrific @entity35 firework accident at a neighbour 's house in @entity38 , @entity7 , where he still lives			1
since then he has been wearing a conventional prosthesis that detects muscle movement in the stump of his arm , allowing him to open and close his hand and grasp objects			2
but without sensory information he can not feel what he is trying to grasp , making it difficult to gauge the amount of pressure needed			2
he now has to cope with the psychological challenge of having re-experienced a sense of touch only to lose it again			0
' i was more than happy to volunteer for the clinical trial , not only for myself , but to help other amputees as well , ' he said			0
the 36 - year - old underwent the procedure to fit the arm at @entity58 in @entity20 , the first such medical procedure of its kind and a breakthrough in bionic limbs in a laboratory wearing a blindfold and earplugs mr @entity6 was able to detect the strength of his grasp as well as the shape and consistency of the different objects he picked up the groundbreaking work was carried out by dr @entity72 and her team from the @entity74 in @entity75			1
mr @entity76 was taking part in a trial of the technology at @entity58 in @entity20 conducted by the @entity75 and @entity81 scientists who developed the experimental prosthetic hand			1
the nerves in the amputee 's arm are attached to electrode relays in the hand to control movement the artificial hand detects information about touch using electrical signals from artificial tendons controlling finger movement			0
fine wires send the digitally refined impulses to four electrodes implanted in the sensory ulnar and median nerves of the upper arm			0
' this is the first time in neuroprosthetics that sensory feedback has been restored and used by an amputee in real - time to control an artificial limb , " said dr @entity72 mr @entity6 had the hand fitted on january 26 2013 but due to clinical trial safety rules , the sensory electrodes had to be removed from his arm after one month			1
however the scientists believe they would continue to function without damaging the nervous system for many years			0
the results of the study , published in the journal @entity116 , are the first step towards a true bionic hand which can feel as well as move , say the scientists			1
however , they point out that it will be years before such a device becomes commercially available			0
a robotic device invented by engineering students at the @entity124 could help its wearer carry an additional 40 pounds ( 18 kg )			0
the robot arm would make lifting a heavy suitcase feel as easy as lifting a cup of tea			2
@entity130 looks and sounds like part of a superhero 's costume , but its creators say it 's designed for ordinary people - those who need either physical rehabilitation or a little extra muscle for their job			0
in technical terms , the apparatus is an untethered , upper - body exoskeleton ; to the layman , it 's essentially a battery - powered arm brace attached to a backpack			0
@entity130 's cost - efficient design has won the team accolades and at least $ 75,000 ( Â £ 45,580 ) in prize money .			0

a bionic hand with a sense of ' feeling ' has been tested in @entity20 on a *patient* for the first time in a breakthrough medical procedure
@entity6 from @entity7 was able to feel the shape and *texture* of objects using the robot hand
' the sensory feedback was incredible ' said the 36 - year - old
the technology raises the *prospect* of artificially restoring lost senses
