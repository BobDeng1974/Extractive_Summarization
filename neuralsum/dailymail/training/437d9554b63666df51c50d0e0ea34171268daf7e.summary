by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 13:33 est , 25 january 2013 a powerful celestial explosion first observed over a century ago has been painstakingly reconstructed as a time - lapse video			2
astronomers first spotted @entity4 in 1901 after a thermonuclear explosion made it suddenly one of the night sky 's brightest objects , and it has not stopped growing since			1
now , using images captured from telescopes in the @entity12 , @entity9 researchers have created a time - lapse film of the supernova 's continuing expansion			1
firework supernova : the remnants of @entity4 , which was first seen exploding in 1901 and has not stopped growing since with this unusual firework display - like pattern they have also constructed a three dimensional map of the remnants left behind by the blast which revealed that , contrary to expectations , it is still growing as fast as 620 miles a second			1
their findings have just been published in the @entity27			0
situated just 1,300 light years from @entity29 , relatively nearby in cosmic terms , @entity4 is also known as @entity4 after a strong thermonuclear eruption spotted on its surface on the february 21 , 1901			1
on that day astronomers observed how its brightness suddenly increased to such an extent that it became one of the brightest stars in the skies			1
supernovae happen when the core of a massive star collapses under the stress of its own gravity			0
the explosions cause bursts of radiation that can briefly outshine an entire galaxy , and drive huge shockwaves into the surrounding space which sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust called a supernova remnant			2
but the astronomers watching @entity4 were surprised to find that the explosion left behind remaining material that was rather unusual			1
it was made up of gaseous knots , which become visible in 1916			0
' from then the visual spectacle has been similar to that of a firework display seen in slow motion , ' said @entity62 , researcher at @entity63 and coauthor of the study			0
after patient work to gather images from @entity69 and the @entity70 in @entity71 , researchers were able to measure the movements of more than 200 knots			2
they calculated the radial velocity of the remnants using the doppler effect to determine whether they are getting closer or moving further away			0
in this way they were able to create a 3d map of the nova and analyse its dynamic			2
a 3d view of the remnant of @entity4 1901 ( the green arrow points towards @entity29 ) : it shows that the stars remains are still moving as fast as 620 miles per second ' such data are rarely available in astrophysics because as a general rule apparent expansion or , in other words , in the layout of the sky , the majority of objects can not be seen , ' said @entity96 , from the @entity97 of the @entity12			1
lead author @entity98 , of the @entity99 in @entity100 , said their findings show ' that the gas seems to be moving further away in a ballistic or free manner and is hardly slowing down , contrary to what was thought in previous studies			0
' until now it was thought that the gas from the explosion would slow down ' significantly ' due to the large quantity of matter in its path that the star has expelled previously			0
however , its speed has remained between a range of 600 and 1000 km / s long before the explosion in 1901 , more than one hundred thousand years ago , @entity4 had already undergone a massive transformation from a red giant to a white dwarf			1
this process expelled its external layers forming a planetary nebula , which is a giant gas cloud within which the nova is now growing in @entity125 .			0

@entity4 first spotted going supernova in 1901 after it suddenly became one of the sky 's brightest objects
astronomers used images captured over the past 60 years from optical telescopes to recreate its continued expansion
they also used the images to create a 3d model of the explosion to reveal that it is still growing a 620 miles a second
