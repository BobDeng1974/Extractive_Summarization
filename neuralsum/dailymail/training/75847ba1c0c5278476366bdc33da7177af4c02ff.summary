by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:33 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 11 june 2013 more than one in five offenders who commit a serious crime are let off with a caution more than one in five offenders who commit a serious crime get off with a caution , official figures have revealed			1
they show police handed out more than 18,000 cautions for sexual offences and violent assaults in the last decade			1
some 22 per cent of all burglars , rapists and other violent attackers in @entity15 and @entity16 were given cautions			1
a fifth of rapists and sexual offenders avoided court			1
and 28 per cent of people who committed a violent assault got off with a s2339828 lap on the wrist			1
thieves had a 27 per cent chance of being handed a caution			1
police also issued them to 40 per cent of fraudsters and 41 per cent of drug dealers or users			1
the shocking figures were prepared by the @entity35 following a parliamentary question by @entity38 justice spokesman @entity37			1
they will fuel concerns that police and public prosecutors are too overwhelmed to be able to properly punish serious crimes			0
the information , released by police forces across @entity15 , shows there were 992 cautions for ‘ indictable only offences ’ in 2011			2
these are crimes considered so serious that they are usually tried at a @entity51			0
a staggering 232 of these were for sexual offences , 137 for violence , 269 for robbery and 18 for burglary			2
since 2002 , a total of 18,782 cautions were handed out for indictable offences			2
over the last ten years , this means sex offenders were let off 2,018 times			2
there were 4,364 cautions for violent assaults , 4,204 for robberies and 2,143 for burglaries			2
a fifth of rapists and sexual offenders avoided court altogether , according to @entity35 figures conservative mp @entity72 , a campaigner against soft justice , said : ‘ these are absolutely appalling figures which confirm the public ’s lack of confidence in the criminal justice system			1
they help explain the high levels of reoffending			0
what sort of deterrent is there for serious offenders ? ‘ we need to put dangerous criminals behind bars , get them off our streets and properly protect the law - abiding public			2
’ police cautions are a way of sanctioning criminals without taking them to court			1
last year more than 200,000 people who committed crimes were cautioned			0
the vast majority received a formal warning about their conduct			0
@entity100 mp @entity72 said the figures were ' absolutely appalling ' some receive a lesser , informal caution – a verbal warning given by an officer which does not count towards a criminal record			1
a formal caution will normally be given at a police station by an officer – but is not classed as a conviction			0
it is administered when there is sufficient evidence for a prosecution and the subject has admitted guilt			0
many are concerned they are being used to deal with repeat offenders or people who have committed a serious crime			0
policing minister @entity122 said the government has ordered a review to examine the issue			0
he added : ‘ serious and repeat offenders should n’t expect to escape with a caution			0
‘ you do have to give that ultimate decision over to the police officer that is involved			0
‘ but in terms of having overall confidence in the system , cautions should only be given for low - level or first - time offences			0
’ however mr @entity37 said : ‘ the public rightly expect that those guilty of crimes like sexual offences , drug offences and criminal damage receive the proper punishment			1
dishing out cautions for serious violent and sexual crimes is wrong			1
‘ it means serious criminals feel they have got away with it and sends out the wrong message			0
if we are to maintain the confidence of victims , witnesses and the @entity158 public then the use of this cheap alternative to proper justice has to stop			0

a fifth of sexual offenders avoided court , according to @entity164 figures
a *quarter* of thieves and 41 per cent of drug dealers were given cautions
@entity100 mp @entity72 said the figures were ' absolutely appalling '
