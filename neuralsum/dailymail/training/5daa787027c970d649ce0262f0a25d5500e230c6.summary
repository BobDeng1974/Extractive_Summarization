on july 1 , the airline began offering three roundtrip flights a day to @entity15 , @entity16 , out of the @entity17			2
' we 've had a lot of no - shows because people miss the flight because they ca n't find the airport , ' said ceo @entity24			1
very confusing : there 's no sign on the highway for state - owned @entity17 and a @entity6 airline says that , along with the winding , confusing road to the west @entity12 field leads to many passengers simply missing their flights there 's no airport sign on the freeway , and the road to the airport has a series of merges and turns through some unpopulated areas			1
despite the lack of signs , the airline has decided to add more flights from @entity45 , the @entity41 reported monday			0
next week , @entity8 plans to begin three daily round trips between @entity45 and @entity47 , @entity48 , and two daily round trips between @entity45 and @entity50 , @entity16			2
' we 've asked the ( state @entity52 ) to put up the normal signs that occur all over the 50 states , and they 've yet to do that , ' @entity24 said			0
' we 've asked and asked and asked			0
we 've even put up little signs ourselves — like campaign signs — but the community takes them down because they 're not approved			0
' lost in @entity60 : @entity8 wants to help @entity61 get to @entity16 from far - off west @entity12 , but they ca n't seem to find the airport the transportation department is working with the city and county and other state agencies to post signs , said @entity68 , deputy director of airports			1
