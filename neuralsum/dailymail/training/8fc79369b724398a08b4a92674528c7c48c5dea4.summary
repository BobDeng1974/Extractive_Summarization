the @entity8 leader , who has now released the poignant photograph , discovered that @entity0 , a @entity22 jew , was worked to death by @entity3 guards aged just 36			1
he is among 60 of mr @entity1 ’s relatives on both sides of his family to have been murdered by the @entity29			1
mr @entity1 , 45 , said : ‘ it has taken us almost 70 years to find out the truth			1
‘ but it 's still very hard to take in			0
we had thought he died in @entity34 , but he died building a @entity3 airstrip in a camp called @entity37			0
’ this was part of the @entity4 death camp in @entity11			1
‘ @entity41 and i discussed what we would tell the boys , ’ he said			0
‘ we told them their great - grandfather died in the war			0
they are too young now for more than that			0
’ @entity0 had arrived at @entity50 late in the war and he died only three months before the camp was liberated by @entity54 soldiers in 1945			2
asked if he was now ready to visit the camp where his grandfather died , the @entity8 leader told the mirror : ‘ i ’m thinking about it , yes			1
’ labour leader @entity1 revealed the recent discovery of his grandfather 's murder in an interview with @entity62 at their studios in @entity65 this morning @entity1 ’s mother @entity66 grew up in the jewish quarter of @entity68 in southern @entity22			1
@entity66 , born @entity69 , was saved from the @entity29 as a six year old girl by a @entity72 family called the @entity73 , who risked their lives hiding her and her family			1
in april , on his trip to @entity19 , @entity1 was reunited with his long - lost 84 - year - old @entity77 - his mother 's cousin , also sheltered by the @entity73			1
@entity1 's dad @entity80 was born in @entity81 in 1924 , the son of a @entity22 leather craftsman			1
in 1940 as the @entity29 occupied @entity81 , 16 - year - old @entity80 and his dad @entity84 walked the 70 miles to @entity85 and escaped on one of the last boats to @entity88			2
@entity84 fought the @entity29 by joining the @entity90 @entity89 , @entity80 joined the @entity91			2
his family had been too upset by the tragedy of losing so many relatives to feel ready to visit @entity34			0
‘ i want to keep his memory alive , ’ he said			0
‘ as the survivors of the @entity99 die off we have to keep the memory alive to stop it happening ever again			2
’ earlier this week mr @entity1 admitted the @entity103 commemorations were ' really emotional ' for him and other @entity105 families affected by the genocide			1
he said his family had not talked much about the @entity99 growing up			1
mr @entity1 said : ' it 's 70 years since my grandfather died in one of the camps and i marked that about ten days ago			1
' and you know , it 's really hard this , because i talked to my mum about this : it 's not the kind of thing you talked about very much when you 're growing up in a household affected by these things , but it sort of marks you and it 's so important that we remember			2
' i think the theme of @entity103 this year is keep the memory alive			2
and as you say , @entity130 , when there 's prejudice around the world , when we see the rise of @entity129 , it 's incredibly important that we keep that memory alive			0
' he explained how he had only just found out about the circumstances surrounding his grandfather 's death			2
' i know this sounds almost unbelievable , but it 's only about six months ago that we discovered the full circumstances of what happened to my grandfather			2
' he ended up in @entity11 in a labour camp , which is where he eventually died according to the records			2
i went to @entity145 , the place in @entity19 where they have records on the @entity99 , and that 's where we discovered more information about what had happened to him			1
' the former @entity3 extermination camp @entity34 in in the town of @entity156 , @entity22 sixty members of mr @entity1 's family were killed during the @entity99 and he yesterday visited the @entity159 , which remembers those who lost their lives in the atrocity @entity1 spoke emotionally about explaining to his children what had happened in the war			1
he revealed how he had to explain to his son @entity165 why he was lighting a candle for his grandfather who had been murdered in a @entity3 extermination camp			0
he said : ' i lit the candle and my kids , my eldest son @entity165 said to me " what 's that for ? " and he 's five so it 's hard to explain			0
' i explained it was my grandfather who i did n't meet and who died at a very young age			0
' mr @entity1 said the experience of his family had made him realise both the horror and hope in people 's treatment of @entity105			1
' it 's awful and it makes me feel incredibly lucky			0
there 's horror and there 's hope , because it 's also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were @entity105 who were hidden by decent people			0
[ there 's another story , which is that there were 17 members of my family who were sheltered in a @entity81 village – that 's on my father 's side – and it was only because of the decent people in that village who helped them			2
' so i think this year and at all times , it 's right to remember the horror , but it 's also right to remember the hope and sense of optimism of what decent people did to save @entity105			0
' mr @entity1 's remarks come as about 300 @entity34 survivors gathered at the site of the former @entity3 death camp to mark the 70th anniversary of its liberation			1
the commemoration will be held at the site in southern @entity22 where 1.1 million people , the vast majority @entity105 , were killed between 1940 and 1945			0
it is expected to be the last major anniversary event that survivors are able to attend in considerable numbers			0
