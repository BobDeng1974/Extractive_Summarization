one of @entity1 's greatest plays has received perhaps its most radical transformation ever after it was adapted into a hip - hop opera - and performed in a jail			2
the story of @entity7 has been ' remixed ' by the @entity8 , who have attempted to update the @entity11 tale of a valiant moor deceived by the villainous @entity13 into believing his wife has been unfaithful			1
four actors in denim overalls and baseball caps rap their way through the epic tragedy with lines such as : ' @entity7 never knew , he was getting schemed on by a member of his crew			1
@entity7 : @entity34 , performed this week for about 450 inmates of @entity30 - the largest jail in the @entity37 - is a rhyming , rapping , poetic homage to the @entity1			1
it has singing and dancing , comic touches , men playing women , sexual talk , references to @entity47 and @entity48 , and a throbbing beat , courtesy of an on - stage @entity51 and a contemporary plot : @entity7 is a self - made rap star turned music mogul comparable to the likes of @entity56 who decides to promote @entity57 , a middle - of - the - road rapper , by releasing his next album			1
that infuriates the more edgy @entity60 , who vows revenge			2
' this is why i hate the @entity66 , ' he fumes			2
' he never lets me get my foot in the door			0
' @entity69 is not seen , but heard , her ethereal golden pipes occasionally filling the air			0
the remix version has already been performed in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity31			1
it was originally commissioned by @entity76 , @entity77 the @entity7 remix is the brainchild of two @entity31 brothers and rappers - @entity81 and @entity83 , aka @entity84 and @entity85			1
they wrote and directed the show , honing 40 or so drafts over eight months into a 75 - minute rhyme - a - thon			1
it 's their third hip - hop translation of @entity1 , following ' @entity91 ' and ' @entity92 '			0
this new @entity7 - originally commissioned by the @entity93 - has been performed in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity31			1
taking the play behind bars , the brothers expected the inmates would apply themes written four centuries ago to their own lives today			1
' the story of @entity7 and the way we paint it is very much of an outsider who kind of never feels like he 's at home and i think that will be pretty relatable , ' @entity83 said before the show			1
' [ it ] really comes down to choices and repercussions and often times , poor choices			0
i ca n't imagine that some people in there are not going to feel that			0
' audience participation : inmates danced in their seats while watching rappers perform the hip hop adaptation of @entity1 's @entity7 at one point inmate @entity120 , centre , cheered from her seat while watching the performance he also pointed to the show 's last words : ' in a cold , dark and unforgiving system we struggle with our destiny			1
when the world is crumbling , emerge from the rubble and your love will surely set you free			0
' watching the inmates applaud and laugh in the sweltering gym , @entity134 , the show 's creative producer , said he quickly knew the play had struck a chord			1
@entity7 ' listened to forces outside himself that made him do really unspeakable acts , ' he said			1
' at the end of the play he says , " look what happened and heed my advice			2
" i think the tension and the resonance of that theme in the room were incredible			0
' @entity120 , a 29 - year - old inmate , agreed			0
she came away from the play believing it had an important message : ' be careful of who you affiliate yourself with because they might not actually be your friends			2
they might be somebody who wants to bring you down			0
' brothers and rappers @entity83 and @entity81 , aka @entity84 and @entity166 , wrote , directed and acted in their hip hop adaptation rapper @entity169 , pictured , performed @entity1 's tragedy to about 450 inmates with his rapper co-stars she said she would try and remember the lesson , ' because i befriend the wrong people all the time			1
' @entity176 , 19 , who swayed with the beat as @entity13 danced his way down the aisle , found his own meaning in the story			0
he said it offered two lessons : ' be honest			0
always think before you do			0
' and @entity185 , a third inmate , also 19 , saw the play as a cautionary tale			2
' you ca n't affect what other people do but you can affect what you do , ' he said			0
the show was an eye - opener in another way : ' in hip - hop , ' he added , ' i finally found out what @entity1 really is			2
' so it is really @entity1 when @entity199 briefly dons a blond wig and joins a faux backup girl singing group a la @entity203 to belt out @entity204 ? and are lines such as ' @entity7 would n't listen , he had crazy tunnel vision ' a true reflection of the @entity1 's greatness ? absolutely , @entity81 said			1
versatile : the four men took on every role in the play , at times wearing wigs and dresses tragedy : the basic storyline of the @entity1 classic remains the same , a story of love that does n't end well ' @entity1 was a master storyteller who used musical language and poetry , ' he said , and the same is true of the best rappers			1
' so at the very basic level they 're doing the exact same thing			0
you 're using poetic devices like alliteration and repetition and onomatopoeia			0
they 're very similar art forms despite how different they tend to be judged			0
' the @entity238 brothers say they have chatted with @entity1 scholars and others who arrive at their shows skeptical and leave impressed			2
' we 're treating the work with respect and we think he was a genius , ' @entity81 said			1
' but our philosophy is you want to live on as an art form 500 years later , you ca n't do it the same way			0
' rapper @entity81 , aka @entity250 ( pictured ) said there was little difference between their play and the original : "			1
. at the very basic level they 're doing the exact same thing ... using poetic devices like alliteration and repetition and onomatopoeia ...			0
they 're very similar art forms despite how different they tend to be judged			0
' after the 70 - minute performance the actors , who are all rappers and @entity51 , took questions from the audience in fact , @entity81 says , if @entity1 were around nowadays , ' i think he 'd be doing this			1
he 'd be a rapper			2
' the @entity272 brothers are now working on a hip - hop version of @entity275 ' @entity274 and plan to eventually create hip - hop translations of all of @entity1 's works , including ' a @entity278			2
' they not only admire the @entity1 , they also think their words measure up to his standards			0
' without trying to sound like we 're tooting our own horn , ' @entity81 says , ' i would like to think that at our best moments it 's like seeing great @entity1 in his time			1
