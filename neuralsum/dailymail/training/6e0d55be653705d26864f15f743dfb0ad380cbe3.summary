@entity6 , who has two daughters @entity18 , eight , and @entity19 , seven , with husband @entity20 , 40 , said : ' i used to dread the school run because i did n't have the confidence to chat to the other mums in the playground			1
i 'd just drop the kids and would n't hang around			2
new woman : @entity6 has dropped from 13 stone to a slimline eight but has grown in confidence big boost : @entity6 was too shy to talk to other parents outside the school gates , but now she 's happy to chat ' i did n't have many friends because i was too shy to say hello and could n't join in conversations because i did n't think i had anything worth saying			1
' i comfort ate chocolate croissants and homemade scones and i was even making late - night trips to the shop so i could make triple - chocolate sundaes			2
' at the time i thought i was doing it to reward myself for being a good mum - but i did n't feel like one			0
' i was so overweight that i began to struggle physically			0
i just did n't have the energy and the get - up - and - go that other parents had with their kids			0
' if i ran around after the girls i 'd get tired very quickly and avoided doing it			0
getting into their playhouse for a pretend tea party also took its toll because i struggled to get down on my hands and knees			0
big problem : she comfort ate chocolate croissants and homemade scones and even made late - night trips to the shop so she could binge on triple - chocolate sundaes ' i felt i was really letting my children and myself down and that was my turning point			1
i realised i had to change			0
' now my transformation has not only meant that i can run around with the children again but it 's also given me the confidence to approach other mums in the playground			2
' it 's actually become a conversation starter and has helped me to build more friendships			0
' by the time she 'd slimmed down to a size eight , @entity6 , a support worker and nutritionist , felt emotionally transformed too			1

i wanted to show off all the hard work i 'd done			0
' and when i did make the step out in front of all those people i was filled with a sudden feeling of elation			0
i 'd finally done it			0
' i still remember looking out in the audience and seeing my kids and @entity20 cheering me on			0
they were so proud of me			0
' i was n't even bothered about winning anything because , for me , i had won already by stepping out on that stage in front of all those people in a bikini			2
' so when they announced that i 'd come third in the @entity85 category i was stunned			1
' feeling good : @entity6 was proud to show her new body off in the beauty contest , where she took third place in the @entity85 category strong : @entity6 pushes herself hard with high - intensity sprints and by flipping tractor tyres in her spare time @entity6 , from @entity123 , @entity16 , has suffered from intense shyness since childhood			1

at her heaviest , she was 13 stone and wore a size 16			1
she said : ' as i got bigger , my self confidence almost completely disappeared			0
' i began to suffer from depression and chronic fatigue			0
at my lowest points , i felt like i barely existed			2
' @entity6 kick - started her transformation in 2011 by replacing junk food with a balanced diet of fruit , vegetables and meat and even started making her own low - fat @entity141 cakes as a treat			1
she also hit the gym three times a week , increasing to five times in the 16 weeks before the competition			2
