nine @entity3 @entity2 caught trying to cross into @entity4 are no longer welcome in @entity5 and should find a new country to live , @entity1 's @entity0 has said			1
the outspoken @entity8 candidate said it was ' unacceptable ' that people who were prepared to join @entity11 should be free to come home			1

@entity33 , 45 – who was photographed with @entity1 leader @entity34 just weeks ago – served alongside mr @entity0 's wife @entity35 on the @entity36 until her resignation in january			2
but mr @entity0 today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to @entity3 without facing any terror charges			1
speaking to @entity41 mr @entity0 said : ' i think i speak for the vast majority of people in @entity8 in saying that this family will not be welcome back in @entity8			1
' mr @entity0 added : ' the @entity46 in @entity4 are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the @entity3			2
' @entity28 and his family were apprehended trying to get into @entity4 and had they been allowed to cross the border then i 've been given to believe @entity28 would now be getting trained up to fight for @entity11			2
mr @entity0 said they were not welcome back in @entity8 ' the police have to recognize this , because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like @entity11 could be allowed to return to civilian life in @entity8 and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable			1
' it shares a border with part of @entity4 controlled by rebel factions including those linked to @entity70 and @entity11			0
the @entity8 nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory			2
the three men and two women , aged between 21 and 47 , were taken to a hospital with their children , aged one , three , eight and 11 after being apprehended last week			0
photographs showed @entity20 , dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots , leading the group from a minibus into a police station			0
several women , all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces , could be seen carrying children			0

the @entity22 family are originally from @entity97 but settled in @entity8 in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006			2
@entity33 posted a picture of himself with @entity1 leader @entity34 on his @entity101 page just before @entity102			0

@entity8 @entity1 councillor @entity22 , pictured on his @entity101 page with @entity112 @entity34 just weeks before his son tried to cross into @entity11 controlled @entity4 @entity28 smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in @entity117 of @entity16 last week he is suspected of acting as an @entity46 smuggler , paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group			1
mr @entity0 said the number of @entity3 fleeing the country to join @entity11 – now thought to number more than 600 – exposed the failure of the government 's anti-terror strategy			1
he said : ' i have spent the last few days in discussions with the @entity130 minister , @entity131 's @entity132 , local authority leaders , religious groups and local people			0
' @entity8 mp @entity0 said the @entity3 family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as @entity11 fighters the outspoken candidate added : ' the message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred , exclusion and intolerance , there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization			1
' i do not think the government 's @entity149 strategy is working and we need a much smarter approach from all the authorities to stop this cancer spreading			0
