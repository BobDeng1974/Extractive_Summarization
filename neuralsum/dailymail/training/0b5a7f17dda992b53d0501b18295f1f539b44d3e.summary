science fiction fans take note : next month on 7 november sees the release of @entity3 , a space epic from director @entity5 , who also directed the @entity6 and @entity7			1
but while the prospect of interstellar travel might seem like something shrouded in science fiction , the film actually delves into science fact - or theory at least - and it might have spawned some important scientific discoveries			0
when calculating how to model a giant black hole in the film , the team created one of the most accurate depictions of such an object that could explain what they would actually look like			1
the model is thought to be the most accurate depiction of a black hole ever the science of determining what a black hole would look like was left to astrophysicist dr @entity28 , who is also an executive producer for the film			1
last month a scientist controversially claimed it is impossible for black holes to exist , based on her mathematical calculations			2
the research was conducted by professor @entity46 from the @entity47 at @entity48 in the @entity49 and scientists			0
she claimed that as a star dies , it releases a type of radiation known as hawking radiation - predicted by professor @entity55			0
however in this process , professor @entity46 believes the star also sheds mass , so much so that it no longer has the density to become a black hole			0
before the black hole can form , she said , the dying star swells and explodes			2
the singularity as predicted never forms , and neither does the event horizon - the boundary of the black hole where not even light can escape			2
‘ i ’m still not over the shock , ’ said professor @entity46			0
‘ we ’ve been studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution gives us a lot to think about			0
’ he found that the black hole warps space so that it looks sort of like a funnel with a black circle in the middle			0
it draws in matter from its surroundings into an accretion disk , shining incredibly brightly and brilliantly			0
this had previously been known - but the visual effects team found when they modelled it , the gravity of the black hole twisted the disk of gas into weird shapes			2
this created a rainbow of fire across the top of the black hole			2
when they used a flat accretion disc around the spinning black hole in their model , the warped space also warped the disk			1
‘ so rather than looking like @entity110 ’s rings around a black sphere , the light creates this extraordinary halo , ’ said @entity105 , @entity106 for the film , reports @entity113			0
the resultant black hole is one of the most realistic depictions ever made of such a phenomena - and dr @entity28 says their research will result in two scientific papers , one for the astrophysics community and one for the computer graphics community			1
dr @entity28 says the effects they ’ve discovered of gravitational lensing interacting with rapidly spinning black holes is something that was not known before			1
dr @entity28 is an astrophysicist from the @entity29			1
he has received numerous accolades for his work and , aside from being a close friend of the late @entity131 , he is also a good friend of professor @entity55 ( middle ) , seen here with director @entity134 of the movie ' @entity55 ' @entity3 hits cinemas on 7 november			1
it sees a crew travel in a spaceship beyond the solar system , and possible the galaxy , in a bid to save humanity			0
it stars @entity143 ( right ) and @entity144 ( left ) in the film @entity143 plays @entity146 - a trailed pilot , engineer and widowed father - who leaves his two children behind on a dying @entity150 in a bid to save humanity			1
the film has already been praised for its accurate depiction of interstellar travel as @entity143 and his crew , including @entity144 , travel across the cosmos			1
from the ship itself , based on a design by @entity164 theoretical physicist dr @entity163 , to the physics of travelling through a wormhole as light bends around the spacecraft , it seems to have got most things spot on			0
but one of the key moments in the film involves the spacecraft travelling near to a black hole - for purposes that have not been revealed			2
however , figuring out what a black hole looks like was somewhat of a problem			0
‘ neither wormholes nor black holes have been depicted in any @entity184 movie in the way that they actually would appear , ’ astrophysicist dr @entity28 , and executive producer , for the film , explained in a video for @entity113			1
‘ this is the first time the depiction began with @entity193 ’s @entity192 equations			0
’ director @entity5 added : ‘ we had determined when we started down this road that if it did n’t look like something that looked comprehensible to the audience we would have to manipulate it in some way			0
‘ but what we found was as long as we did n’t change the point of view too much , the camera position , we could get something very understandable			0
’ interstellar opens worldwide on 7 november - when moviegoers themselves will be able to see the most scientifically accurate black hole ever modelled			1
the film has already been praised for its accurate depiction of interstellar travel as @entity143 and his crew , including @entity144 , travel across the cosmos ( shown )			1
the ship is based on a design from @entity164 theoretical physicist dr @entity163 director @entity5 ( shown ) said : ‘ we had determined when we started down this road that if it [ the black hole ] did n’t look like something that looked comprehensible to the audience we would have to manipulate it in some way			2
' @entity5 is also famed for directing the @entity6 and inception in the film ( poster shown ) @entity143 plays @entity146 - a trailed pilot , engineer and widowed father - who leaves his two children behind on a dying @entity150 in a bid to save humanity			1

a cgi model of a black hole for the upcoming movie interstellar has revealed they have warped halos of light and matter around them
the model is thought to be the most accurate depiction of a black hole ever
it was created using calculations by astrophysicist dr @entity28 from the @entity29
previously black holes were thought to have a flat disk - like @entity110
two scientific papers are being written based on the discovery
@entity3 hits cinemas worldwide on 7 november
in the film @entity143 plays @entity146 , who leaves a dying @entity150 to go on a journey across the cosmos in a bid to save humanity
