by @entity0 if you think the noises you hear around you are purely driven by the outside world , then think again			2
when your brain hears something , the way it interprets the sound is based on both external events and your own expectations			1
listen to this 50 - second audio clip to find out if the trick works for you			1
the clip begins with a digitally altered sound that is entirely meaningless once it ’s heard			1
click on the image to listen to the clip the @entity18 @entity17 's chief bioscientist , @entity16 , then plays the original , unaltered clip with a woman 's voice saying : ‘ @entity22 is at the next stop			1
’ when the altered clip is played again , what sounded like gibberish , suddenly sounds clear			1
this is because when the human brain expects to hear something , it will alter the sound to make it meet its expectations			1
however , psychologists and scientists have been unable to determine exactly what causes this phenomenon			0

this is because when the brain expects to hear or see something , it alters perception of the sound or image to make it meet its expectations these tricks work because when the human brain expects to hear or see something , it will alter its perception of the sound or image to make it meet its expectations			1
‘ all this makes the line between perception and cognition fuzzy , perhaps even vanishing , ’ @entity58 , philosopher @entity57 said			1
psychologists have used visual tricks such as these to investigate how the brain works			2
often , they ’ll use images for which there are two totally different interpretations			0
the phenomenon also happens visually			2
for example , the @entity39 logo looks like a trophy with an abstract football at the top			1
once a person is told it looks like a certain image , they are not able to ' unsee ' that image			2
another example is the famous spot the dog optical illusion , thought to have been created by @entity81 of @entity82			0
the image looks meaningless until someone points out the outline of a dalmation			2
‘ all this makes the line between perception and cognition fuzzy , perhaps even vanishing , ’ @entity58 , philosopher @entity57 told @entity87			1
when people first look at this picture they report seeing a rabbit facing to the right			0
however , if they continue to look at the image it flips to become a duck looking to the left another example is the famous spot the dog optical illusion ( left ) , thought to have been created by @entity81 of @entity82			0

one of the most famous is the duck - rabbit trick			2
when you first look at the picture , you 'll probably see a rabbit facing to the right			0
however , if you continue to look at the picture it 'll flip to become a duck looking to the left			0
this is known as a ' bistable ' image			0
this means viewers are unable to see both pictures at the same time and will instead flip between seeing the duck and then the rabbit			0
this illusion was originally popularised in 1899 by @entity128 psychologist @entity127 , who used it to make the point that we ' see ' with our brains as well as our eyes			0
these tricks reveal that what people think they 're hearing and seeing may sometimes match up more to their expectations than to reality .			0

listen to this 50 - second audio clip to find out if the trick works for you
the clip begins with digitally altered sound that is entirely meaningless
it then plays a woman saying ‘ @entity22 is at the next stop '
when altered clip is *replayed* , what was gibberish suddenly makes sense
this is because when the human brain expects to hear or see something , it will alter perception of the sound or image to make it meet its expectations
the trick also works visually , for example , the @entity39 logo also looks like someone doing a facepalm action
