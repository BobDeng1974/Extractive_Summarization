trouble is , it was			0
because when dozens of foodies headed down to sample the ‘ mind - blowing ’ food at @entity13 ’s after reading its glowing reviews on @entity17 , all they found was an alleyway full of bins			1

instead , the would - be diners had fallen victim to an online prank designed to expose the failings of the review website			1
rubbish : diners who visited the address were baffled when they arrived at an alleyway full of bins a disgruntled businessman said he carried out the stunt because he was fed up with @entity17 not being policed , allowing people to write malicious reviews			1
the man , who will not reveal his identity , has admitted he posted all the reviews , and even provided an email address for bookings			2
the site , which allows people to review restaurants , hotels and pubs , has become a major influence on the @entity46 ’s tourism industry			1
but some business owners have complained of being targeted by rivals , who post fake reviews to deter their customers			2
the prankster set up a profile for @entity13 ’s in may , using the name @entity55			1
he described it as one of the best places to eat in @entity46 , a floating restaurant built in the hull of an old fishing boat amid reefs and shipwrecks in @entity64 , @entity65			1
the profile boasted that staff in diving gear would swim down to catch whichever kind of fish customers wanted			1
the perfect day : rave reviews were posted on @entity17 for the fictional restaurant @entity13 's in @entity65 it was apparently run by a couple called @entity75 and @entity76 , with food and decor based on @entity79 – the @entity81 restaurant often named as the best in the world			1
in a series of reviews , customers raved about its cooking , which ‘ bordered on sorcery ’ , and described it as a ‘ simply divine ’ experience			0
eventually , however , the entire profile was taken down after several diners warned it was a hoax			1
its creator says he set up the bogus listing after a friend ’s hotel received a barrage of criticism he suspected was from a rival			2
he said : ‘ there are many businesses that have had grudge reviews listed on @entity17 , mostly from a rival			0
the restaurant was supposed to have opened up in @entity107 , @entity64 @entity108 : @entity13 's was apparently run by a couple called @entity75 and @entity76 but in fact it never existed baffled : excited tourists flocked to the highly - rated but fictional @entity13 's but were left scratching their heads after finding themselves down this alleyway ‘ many of these are so blatant , any person doing a short check would see the obvious			1
‘ the chances were better then average that @entity13 ’s could have sailed on for months			1
’ the fictional venue was listed as @entity107 , @entity64 , and the page said it moved location dependent on tide and season , making it even harder to find			0
a series of reviews lavished praise on its food and decor , describing it as ‘ perfect ’ , ‘ unexpected ’ and ‘ a beautiful restaurant , tastefully fitted out , amazing food and wine ’			0
bookings began to flood in to the email address supplied by the prankster , who always replied saying the restaurant was booked out for months			1
but that did n’t stop would - be customers arriving in taxis looking for it			0
those disgruntled diners quickly began posting warnings to other visitors , telling them not to be fooled by @entity13 ’s			1
one wrote : ‘ the restaurant does not exist			0

’ despite that , its page went undetected for weeks			0

@entity17 recently vowed to get rid of fake or defamatory postings after hoteliers and restaurateurs claimed bogus reviews were harming their trade			2
but @entity166 , co-founder of the online reputation management firm @entity167 , said the hoax cast doubt on @entity17 ’s ability to spot fraudulent reviews			0
he said : ‘ the listing featured over-the - top reviews for a fake business , but it went undetected for more than two months			2
' it ’s difficult to see how @entity17 ’s system can detect elaborate fraud , if they ca n’t detect one like this			0
’ a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ upon investigation , as this property does n’t meet our listing guidelines , the listing has been removed			0
