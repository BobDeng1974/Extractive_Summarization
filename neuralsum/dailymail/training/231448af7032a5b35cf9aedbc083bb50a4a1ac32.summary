shots : 5 shots on target : 0 goals : 0 touches : 50 touches in the box : 10 @entity8 's proposed transfer to @entity9 will have excited many fans before the @entity11			1
but after some dismal displays for @entity14 , some may be hoping @entity15 has a change of heart			0
@entity17 and @entity18 were criticised for their lack of potency all season , and for their lack of desire to break into the box			0
but with the world champions crashed out of the tournament in @entity27 , @entity8 barely tried to influence play against the brave @entity29			2
@entity15 has admitted that @entity8 was the star striker he was after this summer , with @entity17 and @entity18 grabbing a total of 14 goals between them in the @entity54 last season			2
the @entity11 was his chance to show what he was all about			0
but after zero shots on target and just 21 touches so far in the tournament , his reputation could begin to slide			1
with @entity27 crying out for a dominant centre forward , @entity8 may regret not making the decision to ply for his home country , instead of figuring in @entity14 's tiki - taka system which is out of date , and out of ideas			1
in fairness to the target man , it simply does n't suit his style			0
@entity15 has a habit of getting the best out of players like @entity8 , and while his confidence may be restored quickly upon returning from @entity76 , @entity78 football demands more of an impact for a Â£ 32million rated star			0
loser : @entity8 sits on the bench as the @entity84 side are knocked out @entity85 in hands : @entity32 blew @entity14 away in the first half , with two goals from @entity89 and @entity90 @entity91 on verge of @entity9 switch			1

@entity8 has touched the ball just 50 times in the @entity11
zero goals , zero shots on target , just 10 touches in the box
@entity14 beaten 2 - 0 by @entity32 , knocked out of the tournament
