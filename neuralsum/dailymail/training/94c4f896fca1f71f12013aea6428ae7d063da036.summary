a teenager spent a week on a drip and had to have part of her ear removed after a cheap piercing became badly infected			1
@entity5 , 18 , had a stud put in the top of her right ear in a quick Â£ 10 procedure before starting university , but began suffering crippling pains days later			1
infection set in and despite attempts to remedy it , the student from @entity14 , @entity15 , ended up having surgery after it ate into her cartilage			1
and doctors told her she was lucky her ear was saved at all			0
@entity5 , 18 , just after she had her ear pierced , left , and right , swollen before surgeons had to operate on it miss @entity5 , who studies psychology and criminology at @entity28 , had her piercing done at the end of august at the @entity32 parlour in @entity33 , @entity15 , shortly before starting university			1
within days , however , it was hurting her , so she returned to the parlour to have the original replaced with a small bar			1
miss @entity5 said : ' i went back to the shop when it did n't settle and she said it " needed to breathe "			2
' she took it out and put a tongue bar in which was apparently the worst thing she could have done			1
' but that failed to solve the problem , and a fortnight later , miss @entity5 was rushed to @entity47 for emergency surgery			1
she said : ' the pain was just so much , it was excruciating , and i was throwing up constantly			2
the piercing was disgusting as well - it was bright purple and oozing pus			1
' surgeons cut open her ear in an attempt to ease the pressure , but instead it revealed that the infection had eaten into the cartilage , and they had to cut off the top part of her ear			1
' they operated and found that my cartilage had just disintegrated , ' miss @entity5 said			1
' the surgeons had to build my ear again			2
' the first year student was put on an antibiotic drip for a week and then arrived for @entity72 with a bandage around her head			1
miss @entity5 , who had to start university in @entity77 with a bandage around her head , will be scarred for life she said : ' i had to turn up at university with a bandage on my head			2
it was so embarrassing , especially when you 're worried about making friends			0
' i ca n't even look at my ear because it just reminds me of that horrible time i went through			0
the experience - which doctors said nearly resulted in miss @entity5 developing septicaemia - has now put her off piercings for life			1
' i would never have had this done if i had known , ' she said			0
miss @entity5 's father , @entity95 , 50 , who runs a catering business , has now called in the local authority to investigate			2
he said : ' the surgeon said it was the worst case they had ever seen - in the end they were lucky to save her ear			2
' it will never look the same and has scarred her for life			0
we just do n't want this to happen to everyone else			0
' he added : ' we got told they were changing all their procedures now , but it should never have come to this			0
' but the owner of the @entity116 parlour insisted miss @entity5 caused the infection herself			1
@entity118 said they had not had one complaint in four years , and refuted claims they had inadequate health and safety procedures			0
surgeons hoped cutting the ear would ease the pressure but found the infection was worse than they thought she said : ' if the first thing she did was touch it when she left the shop then it is going to get infected			1
we ca n't control what they do when they leave here			0
' when we changed the bar it was n't infected			0
we told her that if it was bothering her then she should take it out but she did n't			0
' everything we do is by the book			0
as far as i am concerned we have done nothing wrong			0
' a spokesman for @entity149 said : ' as soon as this matter was reported to us , we began an investigation which is still ongoing			2
' there are strict laws governing body piercing and we make regular checks of all establishments which offer this service			0
