by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 12:50 est , 26 march 2012 he ruled over a socialist paradise and promised his people trapped behind the @entity4 he would always be there for them			2
but that never stopped @entity7 leader @entity6 from building an emergency exit - just in case things did not go as planned			1
now the escape tunnel he constructed in the middle of @entity4 has been discovered and opened to the public			2
it led from his office in the former @entity30 - known to all as ' @entity6 's @entity31 ' due to the number of lights inside - to an exit in the former royal stables of the @entity7 emperors at the edge of the @entity38			1
the plan was for him and his politburo friends to high - tail it on a boat to sail away should the cold war turn hot and the city fall to the capitalists			2
@entity48 , in charge of the stables , is now the guide for the tunnel constructed out of reinforced concrete			0
oppressed : east @entity52 walk near @entity53 in 1985 he said : ' it was an escape tunnel specifically for @entity6 and his highest aides in the event of a calamity overcoming the @entity7			1
' the tunnel was made from the same reinforced concrete used for the numerous nuclear bunkers @entity6 had built across his land			1
constructed : august 13 , 1961 second wall built june 1962 third generation wall in 1965 final wall built in 1975 torn down in 1989 border length : 96 miles watch towers : 302 bunkers : 20 persons killed : 192 persons injured by shooting : 200 it exited in the only building left of the @entity75 's former city palace			1
the communists blew up the heavily war - damaged building in 1950 because they deemed it a symbol of ' decadent imperialism '			0
it was built in the 1970 's - a time when the @entity83 still controlled @entity7			0
it was when people were being shot every week at the @entity4 and the ' velvet revolution ' of 1989 that would eventually cause the demise of both @entity6 and his totalitarian nation seemed unthinkable			1
squads of @entity92 secret police labourers built the tunnel under the strictest secrecy			0
it would have been unthinkable to let the people , or the west , know that such paranoia existed in the politburo			0
@entity4 authorities intend to rebuild the so - called @entity101 in the near future - funds permitting			0
they will then use the former escape tunnel as an underground access path for workers to get to the nearby state library			0
@entity6 ruled from 1971 until 1989			1
he died , aged 81 , in the @entity109 capital of @entity110 in 1994 .			0

but @entity6 never got to use it when he fell from power in 1989
