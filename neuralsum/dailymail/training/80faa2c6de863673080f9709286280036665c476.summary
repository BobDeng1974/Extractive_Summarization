by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 03:10 est , 23 august 2013 controversial businesswoman and outspoken commentator @entity1 has taken on mothers doing school runs in her latest rant , saying they are ' bitches because their lives are so boring '			1
speaking in light of the guilty conviction of two @entity11 school mothers who were arrested for assault following a brawl at the gates of their children 's school , @entity1 took part in a debate with journalist @entity19 on @entity22 's @entity21 news service , mornings on @entity24			1
discussing the conviction , @entity1 - known for her controversial opinions and outspokenness - said it was no surprise to her that the mothers had been brawling , especially given that groups of women are instinctively unkind to one another , and that the lives of ' school run mums ' are so monotonous			2
i do n't know what the collective noun for mums is - a mob ? a gaggle ? - but too many is going to cause tension			0
@entity19 says @entity1 is guilty of exactly the same ' bitchiness ' she sees in other mothers ' a lot of that is because their lives are pretty boring : they go from the school gate , to coffee mornings with same mums , and back to school gates , and if that 's all you do in your life you 're going to want to have a scrap every now and then			1
' @entity19 said she thought @entity1 was wrong , and that there is , in fact , a real sense of camaraderie between school gate mothers			1
she said : ' i think this is a fabrication			0
you get colonies of women everywhere , but if @entity1 's having an experience of bitchy school mums it 's a reflection of the messages she sends out herself			2
' i 've never experienced it			0
i have a positive experience with all the mums in my school			0
' i 've seen people support each other through cancer , death , problems with children ... to paint it as a catfight is just wrong			0
' @entity1 countered that she felt school gate bitchiness was intrinsically cliquey , adding : ' if you share enough of your problems , if you have enough cancer , if you have enough death , you 're one of the mob , you fit in			0
' but if you work , if you have interests , then you 're hated with a passion and a fury			0
' speaking about her own daughters @entity39 and @entity41 , she said : ' if there 's one thing i want to inspire my girls to do it 's to work hard and look beyond the school gates ... and not do that drop off more than they have to			2
' @entity19 then retorted that @entity1 is guilty of the ' bitchiness ' herself , but in a more public forum , commenting : ' when you say you do n't like children with ginger hair , and you do n't like names like @entity116 , and that women are slackers , and then you steal another woman 's husband and you boast about it ... are n't you guilty of that very bitchy behavior you 're critiquing in other women ? ' @entity1 said she was simply reflecting their behavior back at them , but in front of a camera			1
