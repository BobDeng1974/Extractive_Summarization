attack : @entity2 prime minister @entity1 criticised the @entity3 at a youth camp yesterday @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has launched a scathing attack on the @entity3 and accused them of being a ' parasite ' on the world economy			1
@entity1 said the superpower was living beyond its means ' like a parasite ' and said dollar dominance was a threat to the financial markets			1
the remarks from @entity2 - one of the world 's strongest emerging markets - comes amid speculation that the struggling @entity3 will this week have its aaa credit rating downgraded			1
' they are living beyond their means and shifting a part of the weight of their problems to the world economy , ' @entity1 said			1
' they are living like parasites off the global economy and their monopoly of the dollar , ' he told the @entity32 youth group @entity33 today			0
@entity3 president @entity34 earlier announced a last - ditch deal to raise the @entity3 debt ceiling and avoid a crushing default that would have repercussions around the world			1
the deal initially soothed anxieties and led @entity2 stocks to jump to three - month highs , but jitters remained over the possibility of a credit downgrade			0
' thank god , ' @entity1 said , ' that they had enough common sense and responsibility to make a balanced decision			2
' but @entity1 , who has often criticised the @entity3 ’ foreign exchange policy , noted that @entity2 holds a large amount of @entity3 bonds and treasuries			1
' if over there ( in @entity3 ) there is a systemic malfunction , this will affect everyone , ' @entity1 told the young @entity2			1
' countries like @entity2 and @entity60 hold a significant part of their reserves in @entity3 securities ... there should be other reserve currencies			2
' @entity3 - @entity2 ties soured during @entity1 ’s 2000 - 2008 presidency but have warmed significantly since his protege and successor president @entity70 responded to @entity34 ’s stated desire for a ' reset ' in bilateral relations			1
talking tough : @entity1 poses as he take part in arm wrestling during his visit to the summer camp			2
during the visit he said that the @entity3 was effectively punching above their weight on the world stage observant : @entity1 takes notes while sitting on a military box during his visit to the camp , and right , the prime minister flexes his muscles on a climbing wall @entity1 's attack on the @entity3 comes as lawmakers there passed an 11th - hour bill last night to raise the @entity3 lending limit and avoid a calamitous debt default			1
despite successfully passing the rescue package , the president must now deal with criticism from both sides of the aisle over the uneasy compromises that were made to pass the legislation			0
both @entity101 and @entity102 saw the bill as an unpalatable necessity and were only able to reach acceptable terms after weeks of bickering and brinkmanship			0
the deal thrashed out between party leaders will see @entity3 ’s legal ‘ debt ceiling ’ rise by up to £ 1.46trillion – from the £ 8.71trillion limit it formally reaches today – which will take the country beyond the election and into 2013			2
desperate : @entity3 president @entity34 talks about the debt ceiling crisis in the briefing room at the @entity117 in @entity118 on sunday repercussions : workers at a foreign exchange firm in @entity122 monitor markets as @entity34 makes an announcement on the debt ceiling more bad economic news and finger - pointing in @entity118 quickly overshadowed early optimism on @entity128 over the debt deal – with fears persisting that @entity3 will still see its credit rating downgraded this week			1
@entity1 criticised the @entity3 during a trip to the youth group @entity33 while he was touring its lakeside summer camp some five hours drive north of @entity135			1
commentators said that the swipe at the ailing @entity3 economy looked like early campaigning before parliamentary and presidential polls			2
partner : @entity1 may not stand aside for president @entity70 ( pictured ) casually dressed in khaki trousers and a striped white shirt , @entity1 flew by helicopter to the tented camp as part of a string of appearances that are being closely watched in the run - up to the elections			0
he did not say whether he plans a return to the @entity153 or will stand aside for @entity70 , his partner in @entity2 ’s leadership tandem , to run for a second term			0
but young people crowding round @entity1 , caught up in the campaigning spirit created by huge portraits of @entity1 hung from trees , were not shy about saying who they wanted as president			0
' @entity2 ’s next president will be small , bald and look like @entity1 , ' 17 - year - old @entity164 joked with reporters			0
asked why @entity70 was not paying a visit to the summer camp , he said : ' only serious people come here			0
' youngsters chanted @entity1 ’s name and applauded his remarks as he strolled round the camp , where @entity3 - style business seminars , extreme sports and political mudslinging were among the topics on offer			1
@entity1 , whose macho image appeals to many @entity2 , briefly swung himself up the first half of a climbing wall , filmed by a gaggle of state television cameras			0
@entity33 , which means ' @entity185 ' , was created by the @entity153 to counter popular dissent after youth activism helped topple a @entity189 government in @entity192 ’s 2005 @entity191 revolution			0
the group has worked to spread a personality cult around @entity1 and regularly campaigns against @entity153 critics			0
opinion polls show @entity1 , still widely viewed as the country ’s paramount leader , retains near 70 percent approval			2
but his @entity201 party is trying to reverse a slide in popularity before december parliamentary polls , hoping to use a strong showing there to help @entity1 in the march 2012 presidential vote .			0

superpower has ' shifted ' its problems onto the world
country is ' living beyond its means ' , adds @entity1
