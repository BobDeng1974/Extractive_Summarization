by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 05:24 est , 23 march 2012 this amazing stunt has probably been performed by thousands of children playing with their @entity4 toys on the living room carpet			0
but the @entity6 required a great deal more skill and courage when scaled up to world record proportions and done in a family saloon car			1
the @entity15 car - made by @entity14 manufacturer @entity13 - broke the previous record after successfully completing the nerve - shredding 42ft tall loop			1
the car appears to have had both front and rear bumpers removed which is done in order to improve ground clearance during the tight loop			2
a full roll cage was fitted to ensure if disaster were to strike and the car fell during its full height , @entity21 , a factory team driver @entity13 - the company which recently bid to take over @entity40 - would have added protection			1
the stunt had to be maliciously planned			0
if the car travelled too fast , it risked destabilising the ramp , damaging the car , or even launching the motor off the edge			1
too slowly , and the car would not generate enough force to defy gravity			2
it would plummet to the ground before completing the full loop			0
bracing : @entity55 's body was subjected to massive g - forces as he was pressed into the car success : @entity21 , driving a common family saloon , more usually seen on the school run or being driven to the shops , completes the loop nerve - shredding : @entity21 beams with delight after breaking the world record for the largest loop - the - loop			0
