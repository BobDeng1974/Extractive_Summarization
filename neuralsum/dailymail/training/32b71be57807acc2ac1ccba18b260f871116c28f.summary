a quarter of the cloths contained one billion @entity52			0
per square metre , which is an organism linked to damp and dirty conditions			0
the bacteria can cause minor skin and eye infections and potentially life ‐ threatening illness			0
all the @entity19 cloths swabbed failed the overall microbiological hygiene tests and the @entity33 also failed 100 per cent of the laboratory tests			2

' a dirty dishcloth can also contaminate hands , which in turn can cause direct contamination of other surfaces and cause indirect infection			0
’ while 40 per cent of people recognise that dishcloths can harbour high levels of bacteria , just 15 per cent regularly machine wash them at high enough temperatures to kill the germs .			2
