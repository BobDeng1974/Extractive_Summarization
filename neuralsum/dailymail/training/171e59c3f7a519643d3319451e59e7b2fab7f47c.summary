by @entity1 reporter published : 04:49 est , 26 january 2014 updated : 09:41 est , 26 january 2014 a women is set to become the first in the world to give birth from a transplanted womb after doctors successfully implanted an embryo into her body			1
the unnamed woman , who was born without a womb , was one of nine to receive a womb transplant in @entity15 between september 2012 and april last year			1
it is now hoped she will become the first in the world to successfully give birth following the procedure after doctors managed to transfer an embryo grown from the woman 's own egg last week			1
this means any child she has through @entity26 would genetically be her own			0
new hope : an unnamed woman may now become the first in the world to give birth to a womb transplant baby after doctors successfully transferred an embryo into her body			1
image shows @entity15 's @entity36 team practising how to carry out the womb transplant operation ahead of the procedure and as her transplanted womb was transferred by her mother , her baby would also be the first in the world to be born from the same womb as their mother			1
dr @entity46 , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the @entity49 , @entity50 , who led the transplant team , told @entity53 : ' the best scenario is a baby in nine months			2
the woman was one of nine to undergo womb transplants in @entity15 between september 2012 and april last year			1
picture shows the @entity15 surgical team practising the transplant operation ' a success would be an important proof of principle that a procedure is now available to cure uterine infertility			1
' the woman suffers from @entity68 syndrome , a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing , but means she still has intact ovaries which produce eggs			1
this meant her egg could be fertilised outside of her body and the embryo then placed in her womb			2
but the woman will have to wait and see if the embryo successfully embeds in her uterine wall before she will know if she is in fact pregnant			1
dr @entity46 admits it 's impossible to estimate the chance of success			0
he told the newspaper : ' we know the pregnancy rate in the normal population − the chance for one embryo would be about 25 per cent − so it may take some trials until we get a pregnancy , or we may be lucky and get a pregnancy first time			2
' seven of the other transplant patients also suffered from this condition while the ninth had her womb removed after suffering cervical cancer			0
the development will give hope to thousands of childless women across @entity104 and at least 15,000 in the @entity105			0
the method has been controversial though because it involves taking wombs from living donors			0
the @entity15 team favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a better immunological match			0
other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not life - saving			0
procedure : doctors grew an embryo from the woman 's own egg before implanting it in her transplanted womb as it is not connected to her fallopian tubes they say the best option is to use an organ from a dead donor			1
this allows them to transplant extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy			0
@entity136 , head of @entity105 , said earlier this month that the charity is ready to give five @entity139 women wombs from dead donors , subject to receiving ethical clearance and raising the £ 500,000 required to cover the cost of surgery			0
‘ we are good to go , save for the fact we have n’t got any money , ’ he said			0
@entity147 , pictured , from @entity148 , had a transplant in august 2011 and subsequently conceived but she miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy mr @entity136 , a consultant gynaecological surgeon , described the @entity15 breakthrough as ‘ amazing ’ and said a successful birth would bolster similar projects around the world			1
any babies the @entity15 women bear are likely to be delivered by caesarean section and the new wombs will be removed after only one or two pregnancies			2
the women are on powerful immunosuppressant drugs but the biggest worry is how well a transplanted womb will cope with the strains of pregnancy , during which the womb swells from the size of a pear to that of a melon			2
critics question the process , with fertility expert @entity173 saying the risks are too great and some women should accept that they will never bear children			0
those in favour say it is the only way for some women to fulfil their deep - seated yearning to have a baby			2
experts say the operations will only be considered a success on the birth of a healthy baby			0
dr @entity187 , medical director of the @entity188 at @entity189 ’s and @entity190 in @entity191 , said : ‘ what remains to be seen is whether this is a viable option or if this is going to be confined to research and limited experimentation			0
’ the world ’s first womb transplant took place in @entity200 in 2000			1
however , the woman ’s body rejected the donated organ after four months			0
@entity148 doctors performed a successful transplant in 2011 , but patient @entity147 lost her baby during pregnancy last year .			1

woman suffers from @entity68 syndrome - a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing , but does *n't* impact the ovaries
she was one of nine women to undergo a womb transplant in @entity15
doctors have transferred an embryo grown from her own egg to her womb
she will have to wait to see if the embryo embeds in the uterine wall to find out whether she is in fact pregnant
if she carries to term , she will be the first womb transplant patient in the world to give birth to a baby
another womb transplant patient lost her baby during pregnancy last year
