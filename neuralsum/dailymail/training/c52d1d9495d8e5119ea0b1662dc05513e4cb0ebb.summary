mother knows best : @entity3 whose daughter did not ' run off ' with the former deputy headmaster at her school it is a sex scandal that has rocked one of the country ’s leading private girls ’ schools and resulted in the resignation of the deputy headmaster accused of having an affair with a former pupil			1
but now the mother of the girl at the centre of the storm has denied any affair took place and accused @entity21 of ‘ hanging my daughter out to dry ’			2
speaking for the first time , @entity3 told @entity24 that her 19 - year - old daughter @entity25 had not had a sexual relationship with married teacher @entity27 , and said that the teenager had been wrongly portrayed as a @entity29			1
mr @entity27 , 41 , was forced to step down last week because of his alleged romance with aspiring singer @entity31 , who left the school last summer			1
but her mother insisted that @entity36 , the headmistress of the £ 17,000 - a - year school in @entity38 , west @entity39 , had taken the action because she and the governors were ‘ paranoid ’ about its image			1
parents received an email from mrs @entity36 informing them mr @entity27 had ‘ resigned his position as deputy head with immediate effect ’ because his role had become ‘ untenable ’			2
mrs @entity36 had reportedly confronted her deputy about the relationship after being told the pair had moved in together			0
but mrs @entity3 , 52 , speaking at her home in @entity55 , @entity56 , denied that there was a relationship , saying : ‘ is my daughter close to @entity27 ? yes			1
has she had a sexual or physical relationship with him ? no. ‘ the school has hung my daughter out to dry and she has become the centrepiece of all this but there ’s no substance to it			1
‘ it was a parent who rang the school – i do n’t know who			0
but my daughter is innocent and now she is being made out to be some sort of @entity29			0
@entity25 is a talented musician and has aspirations of becoming a singer - songwriter @entity25 was a former pupil at @entity73 where @entity27 was the deputy headmaster			1
the school motto is an ancient @entity76 phrase , @entity77 , which translates as ' free and loyal art thou ' ‘ i utterly believe my daughter when she says that there is nothing going on between her and mr @entity27			2
she ’s devastated by all this			0
‘ she ’s my child and i just want to protect her – we are very close			0
@entity31 would have come to me first , without question , if there was anything going on			0
it ’s an extraordinarily expensive school , and i think the school is so paranoid about profile that it can not afford a scandal			0
’ in a further twist , @entity31 ’s former boyfriend said last night he had been told two years ago she had fallen in love with an older man			1
lifeguard @entity94 , 19 , from @entity95 , @entity96 , revealed : ‘ we dated briefly two years ago for about a month			0
things did n’t work out and afterwards a friend told me she had fallen in love with an older man			1
’ talented : @entity100 left school last summer and has ambitions to become a singer - songwriter mr @entity27 was head of music and became close to @entity31 after helping her with her goal of becoming a singer - songwriter			1
but mrs @entity3 insisted that her daughter and mr @entity27 had done nothing improper , saying : ‘ there has been no inappropriate behaviour between my daughter and mr @entity27 in my view			2
‘ yes , he was supportive to her at school			0
yes , he plays the piano with her when she performs			0
but he ’s not sharing a flat with her , he ’s not sleeping with her and i have no idea why he has left his wife now			0
my little girl is a consenting adult but she has not had an affair with that man			0
’ mr @entity27 is thought to have moved out of the £ 600,000 four - bedroom home he shared with his wife @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity96			1
it is understood that the school decided not to involve the police because the romantic side of the relationship is believed to have taken place after @entity31 left the school			2
the headmistress declined to comment last night , but the school has previously confirmed that a teacher had resigned after failing to maintain standards of behaviour expected of staff .			2
