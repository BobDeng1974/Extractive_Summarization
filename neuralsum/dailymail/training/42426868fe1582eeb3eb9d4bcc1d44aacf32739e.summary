the company said there had already been 18 ' incidents ' involving the overheating of faulty dishwashers which were sold under the @entity1 and @entity2 brands			1

the firm said customers who have registered their machines will receive a letter from the manufacturers explaining how to check if their dishwasher is one of those being recalled			0
but it is also urging customers to get in contact to arrange a visit by an engineer if the machine carries the model number @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 or @entity42 with a serial number between @entity44 and @entity45			1
the company said : ' as the leading white goods manufacturer , @entity2 continually monitors the specification and performance of its products			2
' as part of this ongoing process , we have identified that there is a low risk that a component fitted to a limited number of @entity1 and @entity2 dishwashers manufactured predominantly between january 2008 and july 2010 sold in the @entity59 may cause overheating and in rare cases a potential fire hazard			1
' this fault can be easily and quickly repaired by our qualified engineers who will visit affected customers â€™ premises and fit a newly manufactured component free of charge			0
' we are currently in the process of directly contacting all the registered customers we have on our database as an owner of one of these appliances			0

according to that , @entity20 has reported 410 incidents in homes caused by the fires , and @entity1 has reported 38			2
both companies said that many of the machines were likely to have fallen out of use over the years because they were manufactured some time ago			0
