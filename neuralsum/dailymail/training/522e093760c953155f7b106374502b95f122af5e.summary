by @entity0 published : 10:00 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 11:40 est , 17 june 2013 a ten - year - old schoolboy racked up a £ 600 bill in three hours by playing an @entity4 game downloaded for free			1
@entity5 from @entity6 in the @entity7 downloaded the ' @entity9 ' app on his mother 's old @entity4 - and paid £ 19 a time to buy virtual diamonds and gold coins			1
he innocently clicked on the ' buy now ' option which appeared more than 12 times an hour - landing his mother @entity14 , 42 , with a giant £ 613 bill			1
theory : @entity17 ( pictured with @entity5 ) believes he was able to cost her the huge sum because the phone kept a password saved ms @entity22 , who runs a fireplace business , was in control of her son 's @entity26 password but believes he was able to pay because the phone kept it saved			1
today she warned parents to monitor their children 's usage of @entity4 apps to ensure they are not unwittingly racking up monster bills			1
' i 'm not a stupid person but this has made me feel really stupid			2
i 'm devastated , ' she said			2
' it 's a child 's game that attracts children			2
it could happen to so many people			0
' these people are designing these but i would n't allow children to have anything like that if they can spend money on it			0
problems : @entity5 , 10 , managed to rack up a £ 600 bill on a game that was downloaded for free on an @entity4 upsetting : even though the @entity50 ' is a free download , it does contain options for people to pay for extras ' as soon as i saw the emails coming through on the sunday i cancelled my card and got in touch with @entity26			1
the one saving grace for @entity5 ( right ) is that he is not the first youngster to amass a huge amount of money on his parents ' computer			1
the problem is of increasing concern and it emerged earlier this year that @entity26 is to pay £ 66million in compensation to parents in @entity67 whose children run up massive bills using its free apps			1
now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund			2
however , the decision is unlikely to affect @entity76 families			0
a @entity67 legal case was triggered by a nine - year - old girl from @entity79 who bought $ 200 ( £ 132 ) of ' virtual money ' from three free @entity26 games			1
in a lawsuit brought by her father , the games were described as ' highly addictive ' and designed to ' compel ' children to buy game currency			0
under the terms of the case settlement , @entity26 has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $ 100million ( £ 66million )			1
experts say parents should n't let children play with their phone if there are apps that can purchase automatically without inputting a passcode or security check			0
if they do want to let children use their phone , they must make sure they disable the purchase information - this can usually be found in the phone settings , and will mean anyone has to input a password to make a purchase			2
putting your phone on ' airplane ' mode - even if you ’re not in the air - also disables all downloading and in - app purchases			0
' what they do n't tell you is if you download a free app , your phone holds the password for 15 minutes			2
' we looked at the app and it 's all bright colours and has gbp and the amount of money rather than a pound sign			0
' he did n't realise he was spending money but if there would have been a pound sign then he would have done			0
' the game ' @entity9 ' is a new farming experience app where children are encouraged to harvest crops , build bakeries and rear animals			0
it is free to play but the @entity133 warns that some game items can be purchased for real money			0
@entity14 , who lives with her partner @entity136 , 49 , son @entity5 and two daughters , aged 16 and 18 , added : ' @entity5 had only had the phone for six months and has never done anything like that before			1
' he plays other games and he always knew to ask and i drilled it into him that he could only have free apps			0
' in his innocent little head he was playing a game that was n't costing anything			0
he did n't ' i just want to warn other parents how easily something like this can happen			0
' @entity26 have now refunded @entity14 the money and reminded parents to use the restrictions on the game to stop unwanted purchases			1
a spokesman for @entity26 said : ' all @entity157 devices ( @entity158 , @entity4 and @entity159 ) have built in parental controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content			1
' our parents ' guide to @entity169 details the steps and measures parents and guardians can take to make sure younger players have access to the right content			0
' the first thing we recommend is not to share your password			2

@entity5 paid £ 19 a go for virtual diamonds and gold coins on ' *hay* day '
his angry mother @entity14 claims that her old @entity4 saved a password
@entity26 has agreed to refund the cash but says users should be careful
