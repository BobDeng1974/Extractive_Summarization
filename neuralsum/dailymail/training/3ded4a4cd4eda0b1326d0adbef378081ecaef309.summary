by @entity0 a poster advertising a satirical play about the @entity3 and , showing prince @entity4 gagged , has been censored by @entity5 because it fears it could cause offence			1
the advert for the critically acclaimed production of @entity4 features a punk - style portrait of the prince with his mouth covered by white duct tape			1
but despite the fact that the poster has been displayed across @entity5 since the play opened nearly three weeks ago , a nervous @entity12 has decided to pixelate @entity4 ’s face			1
posters advertising the play @entity4 at the @entity19 were pixelated by @entity12 over concerns the punk - style image may cause offence the original image used for the poster			1
@entity12 blamed the company that deals with adverts on the tube last night for the pixelled image last night there appeared to be confusion over exactly why the poster had been censored			1
@entity12 laid the blame on the company that deals with adverts on the @entity5 , saying the ban was made amid fears that the image might cause offence , but it could not say who it was afraid of offending			1
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we work with a company called @entity42 , which handles our adverts on the @entity44 and offers advice			2
‘ they may say this or that could cause offence			0
@entity42 may have said the poster does n’t fit with part of their policy			0
' the decision was made without reference to us and does look to have been a little over-enthusiastic			0
we will speak to them about it			0
’ a @entity59 aide said no attempt had been made to contact @entity4 , pictured during a visit to south west @entity5 last month , about his image being used @entity63 , of the @entity64 which designed the poster , said the news had come as a shock			1
he added : ‘ we were n’t aware until we sent the artwork			0
we sent it off and it was sent back			0
all we know is we had to change it in line with their feedback			0
it was to do with @entity12 ’s rules and regulations about what you are allowed to put up on their sites			0
’ the @entity19 , in @entity80 , @entity5 , where the sold - out play by @entity82 opened on april 3 , still displays a large uncensored version of the poster			1
a theatre spokesman said : ‘ i believe the artwork designers had to pixelate @entity4 ’s face in order for @entity12 to let us put the posters up			2
’ last night , a @entity59 aide said that no attempt had been made to contact @entity4 about his image being used , nor had the @entity4 instructed anyone to censor the advert			2
the play takes place after the @entity97 ’s death and focuses on the @entity4 as he is about to ascend to the throne after ‘ a lifetime of waiting ’			2
meanwhile , prince @entity4 could be crowned as @entity4 of an independent @entity100 under radical plans backed by @entity103 leader @entity102			2
a separate ceremony would effectively mean @entity100 becoming a kingdom in its own right			0
