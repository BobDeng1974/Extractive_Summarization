hope : scientists believe the new treatment could one day help people regain movements lost due to spinal cord injuries a drug could restore the gift of movement to millions of people paralysed in car crashes , sporting accidents and falls , doctors believe			1
the chemical has shown ‘ extraordinary promise ’ when given to rats with severely damaged spinal cords			1
some animals went from being barely able to take a step to being able to walk almost as well as healthy creatures			1
they also became more nimble and regained control of their bladder muscles			2
overall , 21 of the 26 animals improved on the drug – an unparalleled success rate			0
the study , published in the journal nature , was partly funded by the @entity30 government ’s health research arm – the @entity31			2
researcher @entity32 , a professor of neuroscience at @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ‘ this recovery is unprecedented			0
‘ each of the 21 animals got something back in terms of function			2
‘ for any spinal cord - injured patient today , it would be considered extraordinary to regain even one of those functions			2
‘ we ’re very excited at the possibility that millions of people could , one day , regain movements lost due to spinal cord injuries			2
’ dr @entity54 , from the @entity30 government ’s health research arm , said : ‘ there are currently no drug therapies available that improve the very limited natural recovery from spinal cord injuries that patients experience			1
‘ this is a great step towards identifying a novel agent for helping people recover			0
’ each year , thousands of people around the world lose the ability to walk after road accidents damage the spinal cord , blocking the transmission of vital messages between the brain and legs			1
many more are left paralysed after falls and sporting accidents			0
many people will see slight improvements in their condition initially but most will be left with some sort of disability			0
breakthrough : the drug , known as intracellular sigma peptide , has shown ‘ extraordinary promise ’ when given to rats with severely damaged spinal cords ( a spinal cord section is pictured ) the most severely injured will have lost the use of all their limbs and be unable to breathe without the help of a respirator			1
the new drug , which is known as intracellular sigma peptide , or @entity93 , helps damaged nerve cells regenerate , allowing vital messages to be passed to the muscles			1
normally , when they try to grow across a scarred and damaged spinal cord , their path is blocked by glue - like chemicals			1
@entity93 , which is given as a daily injection , sticks to the chemicals instead , allowing the nerves to grow and grow			1
when rats with badly damaged spinal cords were given a shot of the drug every day for seven weeks and their ability walk , balance and control their bladder muscles monitored			1
remarkably , some of the animals saw improvement in all three skills			0
dr @entity32 said : ‘ we set a very high bar to be considered to have “ recovered ”			0
‘ some animals moved so well that they could hardly be distinguished from normal			0
‘ this is very promising			0
we now have an agent that may work alone or in combination with other treatments to improve the lives of many			0
’ further research is needed to understand why the drug worked on some animals and not on others			0
@entity93 is also being tested on other conditions in which scarred tissue hinders recovery , including heart attacks .			2

rats with badly damaged spinal cords given drug daily for seven weeks
their ability walk , balance and control their bladder muscles monitored
vast *majority* of rats got something back in terms of function
some went from barely moving to being able to walk like healthy creatures
