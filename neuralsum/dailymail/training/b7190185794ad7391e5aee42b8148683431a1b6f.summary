@entity8 was born first at 5.04pm , and @entity6 at 5.06pm , but it is @entity6 who will be the future prince of @entity4 , because of the @entity22 principality 's male inheritance laws			1

' we do n't decide in advance which twin to deliver first			0
' had they both been of the same sex , the first one out would have taken the throne but because the @entity4 twins are a boy and a girl , the boy will automatically inherit			2
