the hack attack against @entity2 may have been an inside job and not carried out by @entity4 , cybersecurity experts have said			1
representatives from an independent cyber intelligence company briefed @entity8 agents yesterday on findings which indicate that disgruntled former @entity2 staff and piracy - advocates were behind the hack			1
the @entity8 maintains that the hack was carried out by @entity4 , but are now looking into the possibility that @entity16 hired hackers from outside the country , an official close to the investigation said on monday			1
some private security experts have begun to question whether @entity16 was behind the @entity2 cyberattack at all			1
an investigation by cybersecurity firm norse has found that it is likely a @entity2 insider might have helped launch the attack , the @entity8 was told during a briefing yesterday			1
' we are very confident that this was not an attack master - minded by @entity4 and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history , ' @entity39 , a senior vice president with @entity34 , told @entity48 last week			2
norse believes that a woman calling herself ' @entity51 ' , who claims to be part of the hacking group ' guardians of peace ' , may have worked for @entity2 for a decade before leaving last may			2
consulting firm @entity55 said the results of a linguistic analysis of communications from the suspected hackers suggest they were more likely from @entity60 than @entity4			2
' i think the government acted prematurely in announcing unequivocally that it was @entity4 before the investigation was complete , ' said @entity64 , a former federal cybercrimes prosecutor			2
an investigation by cybersecurity firm norse has found that it is likely a @entity2 insider might have helped launch the attack , and that @entity4 is not responsible the @entity8 maintains that the @entity2 hack was carried out by @entity16 over the release of @entity72 , which depicts the assassination of @entity74 ' there are many theories about who did it and how they did it			1
the government has to be pursuing all of them			0
' while @entity28 officials investigate whether @entity4 enlisted help from outside contractors , the @entity8 stood by its previous statement that @entity16 was the prime author of the attack against the @entity2 unit			1
' the @entity8 has concluded the @entity89 is responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network of @entity2 , ' the @entity8 said in a statement to @entity95			1
@entity4 has denied that it was behind the @entity2 attack and has vowed to hit back against any @entity28 retaliation			1
the people who claimed responsibility for the hack have said on @entity102 postings that they were incensed by the @entity2 film ' @entity72 , ' a comedy about a fictional assassination of @entity4 leader @entity74			2
because of the hackers ' threats , major @entity28 cinema chains refused to show the film			0
last week , @entity2 struck deals with some 320 independent theaters to distribute ' @entity72 ' and also made the film available online			0

' there is no credible information to indicate that any other individual is responsible for this cyber incident , ' the agency said			0
@entity132 , whose security firm was hired by @entity2 to investigate the attack , said the only way to know who the culprits are is to trace the network traffic from the infected machines back to the hackers ' machines			2
only the government and internet service providers have that kind of visibility , he added			0
' i do n't have the data that they have to come up with that conclusion , ' @entity132 , chief operating officer of @entity146 , said			0
' every attack loops through numerous machines , ' he said			0
' you have to peel that onion all the way back			0
it is n't an easy thing to do			0
' @entity132 , who has supervised investigations into some of the world 's biggest cyberattacks , said the @entity2 case was unprecedented			0
' nobody expected when somebody breaks in to absolutely destroy all your data , or try to anyway , and that 's just something that no one else has seen , ' he said .			0
