despite the driver slamming on the emergency brake , the train did not stop until after it had gone over @entity8 , leaving the traumatised driver sure he was dead			1
astonishing escape : @entity8 , 51 , survived after a train went over him near these tracks outside @entity9 station astonishingly , though , the intoxicated man had survived with merely a cut to the head			1
later , when police asked him how drunk he was on a scale of one to 10 , he replied : ' 11 '			1
details of @entity8 's escape emerged at court where he was jailed for 12 months after admitting obstructing an engine using the railway - an offence under the @entity35 of 1861			1
the incident occurred in june after train driver @entity37 spotted @entity8 staggering onto the railway line ahead of him just outside @entity9 station			1
mr @entity37 sounded the horn to alert @entity8 but the man - whom the court heard was drunk - ignored him , instead crossing one set of tracks before lying down in the middle of the track			1
prosecutor @entity47 said : ' the driver tried an emergency stop but he was travelling at 50mph and he did n’t succeed in stopping when he passed over the top of the defendant			2
' the driver was quite sure he had killed him and went to investigate			2
he found blood but no corpse			0
' investigations were made and the conductor of the train said that he had seen a man run off			0
his head was covered in blood and was found walking in the road nearby			0
' driver 's trauma : @entity7 heard how the driver of the @entity15 train similar to this one tried to stop @entity8 was taken to @entity65 where he was said to be ' confused			1
' he was later interviewed at home at @entity9 and confessed to being drunk and was going to sleep on the tracks			2
he admitted : ‘ i feel sorry for the train driver '			2
mr @entity47 added : ' it is hard to imagine anybody putting themselves down on a track in front of a fast moving train without realising the possibility of death			0
' ' the driver was quite sure he had killed him ... he found blood but no corpse ' - prosecutor @entity47 the court heard that the trauma of what mr @entity37 had gone through was ' probably his worst nightmare ' on thinking that his train had killed the man			1
in mitigation defence counsel @entity88 claimed his client was planning to take his on his own life			0
but passing sentence , judge @entity91 said : ' i note there is no history of of mental illness and when you were arrested by the police you were clearly under the influence			0
' the explanation for your actions was to the effect of : you did n’t know why you got onto the track and that you were very heavily intoxicated			0
' you put the driver in the agonising position of having to apply the brakes as fast as he could and he knew he had n’t stopped in time			0
' as far as the driver was concerned his immediate thought was that there had been a fatal accident described as being the nightmare that any train driver would suffer			2
' usually anyone who ends up under a train ends up dead ' - @entity117 union spokesman @entity116 ' it must have been absolutely awful for the driver to think that despite his efforts his train had killed someone who had chose to lay down on the track			1
' in a statement at the time of the incident , @entity117 train drivers ’ union spokesman @entity116 said : ' it is amazing that this man survived			0
' usually anyone who ends up under a train ends up dead or with dramatically life - changing injuries			2
it is traumatic [ for the drivers ] and i do n’t think people consider the consequences of their actions			0
' he added : ' there are around 200 incidents on the track each year so drivers are going out there every day afraid of this happening to them			0
' many drivers have been involved in an incident then have to travel down the same stretch of track every day			0
