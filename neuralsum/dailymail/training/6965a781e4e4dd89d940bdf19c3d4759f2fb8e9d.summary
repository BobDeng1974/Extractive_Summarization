by @entity1 reporter published : 23:51 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 25 september 2012 @entity2 yesterday led @entity3 in another attack on @entity6 's foreign policy , criticising the president for describing the murder of the @entity10 ambassador to @entity11 as a mere ' bump in the road '			1
the criticism came as mr @entity6 once again changed the language he used to describe the attack , which occurred in @entity17 two weeks ago and which he said was ' not just a mob action ' when he appeared on the view with his wife @entity20			1
the @entity3 challenger 's advisers say the recent unrest in the @entity24 has made voters question the president 's foreign - policy credentials , an area in which he has until now led mr @entity2 thanks to the mission which killed @entity31 last year			1
the most devastating incident was the raid on the @entity10 consulate in @entity17 on september 11 which killed ambassador @entity35 and three other @entity10			1
@entity41 , the @entity42 majority leader , said : ' @entity43 continues to find itself on the receiving end of harsh language by the president and the @entity42			1
' there is a somewhat continued pattern of throwing @entity43 under the bus when @entity43 stands as our closest ally			1
' and the @entity53 issued challenges to @entity56 candidates in several races to ' share their view ' on mr @entity6 's remarks in an interview with @entity61 's 60 minutes over the weekend			1
aggression : @entity2 said the recent unrest in the @entity24 was more than a ' bump in the road ' opposition : @entity42 majority leader @entity41 argued that mr @entity6 should be closer to @entity43 's government in the interview , mr @entity6 was responding when asked if recent events in the @entity24 gave him pause for supporting governments that came to power after the @entity72			1
he said he has long noted that events were going to be rocky , adding that the question itself ' presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change '			2
' i think it was absolutely the right thing for us to align ourselves with democracy , universal rights , ' he said			0
' but i was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because , you know , in a lot of these places the one organising principle has been @entity91			0
' he added : ' there are strains of extremism , and @entity96 , and anti-western sentiments and you know can be tapped into by demagogues			0
' fury : protests have been raging in the @entity91 world over a @entity10 - made video mocking the @entity104 mr @entity2 was eager to talk about the topic , squeezing interviews with three television networks into his schedule and touching on the subject at the beginning of a rally in @entity112 , @entity113			2
' i ca n't imagine saying something like the assassination of ambassadors is a bump in the road , when you look at the entire context , the assassination , the @entity129 president being elected in @entity130 , 20,000 people killed in @entity132 , @entity118 close to becoming a nuclear nation , that these are far from being bumps in the road , ' he told @entity133			0
' they represent events that are spinning out of the kind of influence we 'd like to have			0
we 're at the mercy of events rather than shaping the events in the @entity24			2
' @entity10 officials are investigating the deaths in @entity11 , which occurred when the consulate was breached.in his appearance on @entity19 , the president avoided a direct answer when asked if the attack had been terrorism			2
' there 's no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used , the ongoing assault , that it was n't just a mob action			0
what 's clear is that , around the world , there are still a lot of threats out there , ' he said			0
mr @entity2 intends to return to the subject of international affairs and discuss foreign aid , trade agreements and international development when he addresses the @entity167 in @entity168 on tuesday , according to a source			0
the candidate , like mr @entity41 , took a jab at mr @entity6 's handling of relations with @entity43 on monday			1
' the president does n't have time to actually spend time with leaders of these nations , particularly @entity179 , ' he said			0
' i find that very troubling			0

@entity3 candidate says @entity10 administration is ' at the mercy of events '
