he also reportedly considered killing the parents of his 12 - year - old girlfriend , though no further details about the confession , and they are continuing to piece together the timeline of events			2
sheriff 's department spokesman @entity61 told @entity63 that they are still unsure of what the boy was doing between the hours of 5am - when he reportedly killed his father - to 8pm on saturday when he drove to their local @entity66 and told one of the churchgoers			1
that person then called the police			0
mr @entity61 said that the investigation is still ongoing but there are no active searches for any other suspects			0
filling in the gaps : sheriff @entity15 ( right ) and lt. @entity77 ( left ) said that the teen has been ' very unemotional ' throughout his questioning and is currently being held in the local juvenile detention center he confirmed that all of the weapons - both the .22 - calibre rifle and @entity85 military assault rifle that were used to kill the relatives , and the two additional shotguns that @entity1 had on him when he drove to the church - were all legally owned by his father , former pastor @entity89			1
