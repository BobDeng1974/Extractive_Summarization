a previously unknown virus linked to obesity and diabetes has been discovered - and researchers say it lives in the gut of more than half the world 's population			1
called @entity9 , it infects one of the most common types of gut bacteria , @entity13			1
the researchers first noticed the virus in a computer simulation - then found it was present in more than half the people they tested			1
the researchers first noticed the virus in a computer simulation - then found it was present in more than half the people they tested the researchers were using results from previous studies on gut - inhabiting viruses to screen for new viruses			1
in the @entity39 fecal samples from 12 different individuals , they noticed a particular cluster of viral dna , about 97,000 base pairs long , that the samples all had in common			1
when @entity45 and his colleagues checked this discovery against a comprehensive listing of known viruses , they failed to find a match			2
the researchers then screened for the virus across the database of the @entity55 ’s @entity54 ( @entity56 ) , and @entity60 's @entity59 - @entity58 database , and again found it in abundance in samples derived from human feces			1
the research appears today in @entity66 , after @entity45 , a bioinformatics professor at @entity67 stumbled upon the discovery by accident			2

to prove that the viral dna they discovered in their computer data actually exists in nature , fellow @entity67 virologist @entity82 used a technique known as dna amplification to locate the virus in the original samples used to build @entity55 ’s database			0
' so we have a biological proof that the virus they found with the computer actually exists in the samples , ' @entity82 said			0
this was a new virus that about half the sampled people had in their bodies that nobody knew about			0
' it ’s not unusual to go looking for a novel virus and find one , ” @entity45 said			0
' but it ’s very unusual to find one that so many people have in common			2
' the fact that it ’s flown under the radar for so long is very strange			0
' the discovery could lead to a new understanding of obesity the fact that it ’s so widespread indicates that it probably is n’t a particularly young virus , either			1
' we ’ve basically found it in every population we ’ve looked at , ' @entity45 said			0
' as far as we can tell , it ’s as old as humans are			0
' he and his team named the virus @entity9 , after the cross-assembly software program used to discover it			1
@entity126 bacteria live toward the end of the intestinal tract , and they are suspected to play a major role in the link between gut bacteria and obesity			1
what role @entity9 plays in this process will be a target of future research			1
further details about @entity9 have been difficult to come by			1
it ’s unknown how the virus is transmitted , but the fact that it was not found in very young infants ’ fecal samples suggests that it is not passed along maternally , but acquired during childhood			0
the makeup of the viral dna suggests that it ’s circular in structure			0
further laboratory work has confirmed that the viral dna is a singular entity , but it ’s proven difficult to isolate			0
' we know it ’s there , but we ca n’t capture it quite yet , ' @entity45 said			0
once the virus is isolated , he hopes to delve into its role in obesity			2
the virus might also be used to prevent or mitigate other diseases affected by the gut such as diabetes and gastroenterological maladies			1
once these processes are better understood , @entity45 envisions one day the possibility of personalized medicine based on this virus			0
' this could be a key to personalized phage medicine , ' he said			0
' in individuals , we could isolate your particular strain of the virus , manipulate it to target harmful bacteria , then give it back to you			2

@entity9 infects one of the most common gut bacteria , @entity13
connected with obesity , diabetes and other gut - related diseases
could lead to new personalised medicines for *weight* loss
