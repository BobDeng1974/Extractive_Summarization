click here to read @entity2 's match report from @entity3 's @entity5 's second - half absence proved to be extremely costly to his side 's hopes of maintaining their impressive run as his replacement @entity10 and @entity11 failed to deal with @entity13 's runners			1
@entity13 's opening goal was fortuitous as @entity5 may have been in a better position to block @entity17 's shot had he not picked up a knock before the interval			1
both @entity20 and his players will be hoping the @entity22 international is fit for @entity25 's next two fixtures against @entity26 and @entity27			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity25 failed to shine after key player @entity5 was substituted due to an injury knock @entity5 was tasked with keeping a close eye on @entity13 's runners such as @entity32 @entity25 boss @entity20 will be hoping @entity5 is back in time to face @entity26 and @entity27 saints are clearly at their best when @entity5 , who @entity20 forced to stay at the club following a mass summer exodus at @entity3 's , is dictating play from his side 's engine room			1
@entity25 boss @entity20 came into his side 's @entity41 encounter against @entity13 brimming with confidence having led his side to second spot after 12 games			2
the @entity47 said he had not ' seen one team better than us ' throughout his first few months in @entity50 but that claim is no longer relevant after sunday 's result			0
@entity20 will be extremely disappointed that his side were beaten by a @entity17 goal , which was deflected into @entity56 's net , and late strikes by @entity58 and @entity59			1
the home side rarely tested @entity61 but they also managed to keep @entity63 's side at bay for the first 75 minutes			0
@entity5 was deployed in a defensive midfield role to screen @entity25 's back four			2

@entity41 top scorer @entity82 was denied a stonewall penalty by referee @entity84 in the first half - but he rarely had a sniff at goal other than in the 84th minute when @entity25 were hit on the counter attack			0
the biggest negative for @entity25 was that they lacked creativity to unlock @entity13 's shaky defence - even when @entity91 was shown a second yellow card in the 74th minute for a reckless challenge on substitute @entity94			0
@entity58 and @entity59 managed to put the game to bed when @entity25 were on the lookout for a goal but again @entity20 's midfield failed to track @entity13 's runners from deep			1
the @entity41 fixture computer has been unkind to @entity25 in making the south coast side face @entity13 , @entity26 and @entity27 in quick succession - but it also provides @entity20 's side the chance to prove their manager was right in suggesting they can go toe - to - toe with the big boys			2
@entity91 was given his marching orders after picking up two yellow cards against @entity25			0

@entity5 was *withdrawn* at half - time after sustaining thigh injury during first half
@entity13 *utilised* space in midfield after @entity5 's *withdrawal*
@entity17 , @entity58 and @entity59 scored for the away side
