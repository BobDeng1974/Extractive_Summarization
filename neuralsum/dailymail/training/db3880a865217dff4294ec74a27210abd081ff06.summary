by @entity0 for @entity1 botox injections could provide an effective new treatment for stomach cancer , research has shown			2
the rejuvenating anti-wrinkle treatment used by numerous celebrities slows tumour growth by blocking nerve signals that stimulate cancer stem cells			1
in laboratory tests , @entity11 - made from the toxin of botulism bacteria - proved ' highly effective ' at suppressing gastric cancer in mice			1
the promising results have led to the launch of an early clinical trial involving human patients with stomach cancer in @entity22			1
botox injections could provide an effective new treatment for stomach cancer , as scientists found the anti-wrinkle treatment slows tumour growth locally administered @entity11 mirrored the effect of ' vagotomy ' - surgical removal of branches of the gastric vagus nerve , which regulates processes linked to digestion			1
@entity36 lead researcher dr @entity35 , from @entity37 in @entity38 , said : ' scientists have long observed that human and mouse cancers contain a lot of nerves in and around the tumour cells			2
' we wanted to understand more about the role of nerves in the initiation and growth of cancer , by focusing on stomach cancer			2
' we found that blocking the nerve signals makes the cancer cells more vulnerable - it removes one of the key factors that regulate their growth			1
' @entity11 prevents nerve cells releasing a neurotransmitter - a chemical signal - called acetylcholine			2
in cosmetic treatments , blocking acetylcholine reduces wrinkles by temporarily paralysing face muscles			0
the neurotransmitter is also known to stimulate cell division , hence the link to cancer			0
co-author professor @entity68 , from the @entity69 , said : ' the anti-cancer effects were remarkable , especially with local vagotomy or by injecting @entity11			0
' it actually surprised us			0
the finding that @entity11 was highly effective was particularly exciting			1
' he added : ' we believe this treatment is a good treatment because it can be used locally and it targets the cancer stem cells			1
' the @entity11 can be injected through gastroscopy ( a thin tube passed through the mouth to the stomach ) and it only requires the patient to stay in the hospital for a few hours			0
' botox injections were less toxic than most standard cancer treatments , caused hardly any side effects , and were relatively cheap , said the scientists			0
however , they pointed out that combining nerve - targeting treatment with traditional chemotherapy may be the most effective approach			2
@entity11 slows tumour growth by blocking the nerve signals that stimulate cancer stem cells			1
the promising results in mice has prompted a new clinical study using human participants in @entity22 tests showed that removing the nerve signals not only had a direct effect , but also made cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy drugs			1
in mice , the combination of @entity11 and chemotherapy boosted survival rates by up to 35 % compared with chemotherapy alone			0
the research , published in the journal @entity109 , focused on early - stage stomach cancer			0
' in the future , we 'd really like to look at how we can use this method of targeting nerves to stop the growth of more advanced tumours , ' said dr @entity35			0
his laboratory hopes to develop drugs that block the receptor molecules on the surfaces of tumours that are sensitive to acetylcholine			0
this could be more effective than either surgery or @entity11 in more invasive cancers , since it would seek out cells that have broken away from the main tumour			2
other solid tumours , such as prostate cancer , may have their growth stimulated by similar nerve signals , say the scientists			1
but more research was needed to identify the nerves involved , which were expected to vary between different organs and tumour types .			0
