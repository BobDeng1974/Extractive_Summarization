by @entity0 a mobile phone app company has been fined £ 60,000 after children as young as three were able to access it and run up bills of up to £ 150			1
@entity7 company @entity6 were fined yesterday by a phone regulator after parents complained that children were just one click away from phoning their premium rate number to use its voice changing service			1
the company ran a series of banner adverts that would appear on children ’s apps promoting its voice - changing service			1
outrage : a tribunal blasted a mobile company for bringing children within one click of a premium - rate service that allows users to make their voices sound like @entity27 characters by running enticing adverts by clicking on the advert the phone would ring the premium rate line at a cost of £ 1 a minute plus network rates			1
the person could then record a message which would be digitally altered so they could sound like an alien or @entity27 character			1
but unlike other similar services the call did not cut off once it reached a cap of £ 3			0
this led to up to 14 complaints from parents who said their children had activated the number			0
in one case the child was just three and in another a bill of £ 150 was charged			0
@entity49 fined @entity6 £ 60,000 and ordered it to refund all complaints in full within 28 days of being asked			2
@entity6 advertised its app and service on mobile phone apps and websites that were popular with young children			1
phone regulator @entity49 said it appeared on @entity57 , talking @entity58 and @entity59			0
the tribunal verdict said the voice - changing service was guilty of not fixing a cap on spending , not providing enough information on costs on its adverts and ‘ treating consumers unfairly ’			1
they said that children were likely to find the company ’s adverts appealing as they featured ‘ bright colours and cartoonlike characters ’			0
one parent who complained said : ‘ my daughter tapped it by accident which then immediately phoned the premium rate 090 number			2
under fire : the @entity7 app company , @entity6 , has been fined for running the brightly - coloured adverts misled : the regulator warned companies to impose barriers to ensure children are not misled on mobiles ‘ there was no secondary ‘ are you sure you want to call this number ’ fail safe which meant that she has run up a £ 15 charge on my bill			1
i think that it is ridiculous that this sort of ad is allowed on a children ’s app. ‘ the fact that this ad only needed to be tapped once before activating the phone call is ridiculous			0
’ @entity105 , from @entity49 , said : ‘ by promoting its service in such a way as to mislead young children into clicking on a link which would automatically connect and charge them , and by failing to impose the required spend caps on a service which was clearly aimed at children , @entity6 has treated children , and by extension their parents , unfairly			2
‘ practices which mislead consumers , especially vulnerable consumers , and result in bill shock cause serious harm to those affected and to the wider reputation of the premium rate sector			2
@entity49 will not tolerate them			0
’ the service has since been removed from publicly available banner ads but is instead available from app stores , where it must first be downloaded and credit must be purchased to use the service			0
@entity6 did not respond to requests for comment last night .			0
