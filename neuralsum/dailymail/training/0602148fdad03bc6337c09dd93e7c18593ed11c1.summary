the @entity1 seal who claims he killed @entity3 says he shot the terrorist a third time ' just for luck			1
' @entity7 , who was unmasked last week by @entity8 as ' @entity9 ' , had been trained to use two head shots during missions - known in military circles as a double tap			1
however , according to the @entity14 , he told families of 9/11 victims there was ' no harm in putting one more bullet in him			2
and that 's closure ' under fire : this comes as many are attacking @entity7 for making his identity as a @entity31 public according to the paper , he made the comments during a secret meeting at the memorial museum at the @entity36 in july			1
describing the night of the raid , he said that he did n't know who ' the @entity38 ' was going into the mission			1
before his unit set off , he had time to make one , last phone call to his children , fearing he may never see them again			0
he recalled how he climbed into @entity3 's compound , walked upstairs and heard			1
his weapon then went : ' pop ! pop ! pop ! ' the audience , all relatives of people who died in the attacks on the @entity51 had no idea they would be receiving a first hand account of how the mastermind was killed			2
initially they were invited to a ' private and confidential ' event that included a talk by a ' mystery speaker '			0
last week , following his first televised interview , he said : ' he ( @entity3 ] died afraid , and he knew we were there to kill him			1
' down : @entity7 says of what happened , that anyone who questions him can only ask one other person what really happened , @entity3 ( above ) , and he 's dead @entity7 opened up about his meeting with the relatives of the 9/11 terror attacks saying : ' [ o ] ne thing i tell them is all right , @entity3 died like a p * * * *			1
that 's all i 'm telling you			0
' this was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews @entity7 had with journalist @entity81 that were aired on friday 's @entity83			2
he added that it does n't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist			0
' the most important thing that i 've learned in the last two years is to me it does n't matter anymore if i am @entity9 , ' @entity7 said			2
' regardless of the negativity that comes with it , i do n't give a f * * *			1
' site : @entity7 also revealed that he and his fellow @entity31 did not think they would return alive after the raid on @entity3 's hideout ( above ) he also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow @entity31 did not think they would make it out alive after raiding @entity3 's hideout			1
' well , you have to go pump yourself up to go die			0
so we would talk about this , ' @entity7 said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them			0
' ( it was a ) group of guys who knew time on @entity110 was up , so you could be honest with each other			0
and we all accepted and nobody was afraid			0
' @entity7 's move to go public has been met with mixed response , and heavily criticzed among his fellow @entity31			1
he sees it differently however , pointing out how films like @entity118 and @entity119 both made his work very public , and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents			0
' once anyone says anything at that level , it 's not classified , ' he said			0
' i was told by people that i ca n't even say i 'm a @entity31 , so i do n't give a f * * * what they think			1
' public guy : @entity7 seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews , saying he does n't care if people think he is ' full of s * * * ' as for those who question him , he is not letting it bother him			1
' even now , i mean , there are guys now saying that i am full of s * * * , ' he said			1
' you only know what you were told unless you were in the room			0
and unfortunately for me , there was two people in the room , and one of us is dead and that 's @entity3			1
' @entity7 is due to appear in a two - part documentary on @entity151 next week , detailing his part in the killing of @entity3			1
@entity8 exclusively disclosed his identity ahead of the broadcast			2
@entity156 has already described the night of may 2 , 2011 in an interview with @entity159 ’s ex-husband @entity158 that appeared in @entity160 in february 2013			0
but his name was not revealed at that time and he was referred to only as ‘ the shooter			0
’ now his identity has become public , military leaders and fellow seals are lining up to discredit his version of events			0
donation : @entity7 gave his seal team uniform the museum at the memorial to the september 11 terror attacks in @entity172 after meeting relatives of the victims of @entity3 's atrocity			1
it was then that he decided to tell the wider public that he was ' @entity9 ' speaking success : @entity7 is now a high - profile member of the motivational speaking circuit , openly revealing that he was a seal - but until now not declaring that he was involved in the daring raid which killed @entity3 a former @entity183 commander told the @entity184 only fired ‘ insurance shots ’ into @entity3 ’s twitching body after the terror leader had already been mortally shot by an unidentified seal who is still in the service			1
that hero is described as the ’ point man ’ who led the @entity31 up the stairs in @entity3 ’s compound to the bedroom where he was hiding			1
another @entity183 member also disputed @entity156 ’s version , saying the ' point man ' had wounded @entity3 with a shot to the side , and then grabbed the women in the room for fear they were wearing explosives			2
@entity156 , he said , had then finished @entity3 off			2
and @entity204 quoted an unidentified source close to a seal team 6 member as saying the fatal shot was fired by one of two other men who entered the room before @entity7			2
but @entity156 told @entity158 last year : ‘ i shot him , two times in the forehead			2
bap ! bap ! the second time as he 's going down			0
he crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and i hit him again , @entity217 ! same place			0
that time i used my @entity220 red - dot holo sight			0
i watched him take his last breaths , just a reflex breath			0
’ one @entity31 source told @entity8 : ' the real shooter would never discuss it publicly			1
' members of @entity183 have n’t discussed it publicly so there ’s a reasonable chance he ’s not being truthful			0
' there is no way @entity156 could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on @entity3 unless his comrades all attested to it			2
' but again , the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that			0

the @entity1 seal was unmasked this week by @entity8 as ' @entity9 '
told a secret meeting at the @entity36 he shot @entity3 three times
described how he was trained to fire two head shots during missions
however he landed the third on the terrorist for ' good *measure* '
claimed he had no idea who the ' the @entity38 ' was going into the mission
last week he said that : ' @entity3 died like a p * * * * '
revealed that he and his fellow @entity31 did not think they would make it out alive after raiding @entity3 's hideout
