@entity0 could have been awarded a penalty in the first half of their @entity4 clash with @entity5 at @entity6 on sunday			2
there were two separate incidents in the area as @entity10 appeared to wrestle @entity11 to the ground as @entity13 similarly seemed to hold @entity14			1
@entity16 's @entity15 gives his verdict of @entity19 's handling of the incident			0
@entity10 and @entity13 both appear to headlock @entity11 and @entity14 @entity10 appears to blatantly pull down @entity11 in the penalty area at @entity6 @entity11 is holding onto @entity10 after being dragged down in the area by the @entity5 defender the @entity0 defender appeals to @entity19 shortly after the incident in the @entity5 area you could argue it should be two penalties			1
it ’s not just @entity10 on @entity11 , you ’ve got @entity13 on @entity14			1
the two have virtually got them in headlocks			0
from @entity19 ’s position he should see this			0
you can tell by @entity11 ’s reaction ; he ’s not just appealing — he ’s going berserk			0
the @entity5 ones are worse than @entity39 ( versus @entity40 ) last week			0
@entity19 let @entity0 down by ignoring two headlocks by @entity5 defenders at the same setpiece and by doing so also let his select list colleague @entity44 down			1
@entity44 was the referee who correctly awarded @entity40 a penalty when @entity39 held @entity46 and @entity19 had the chance to reinforce referees resolve to stop this practise by awarding @entity0 the penalty they deserved for either @entity13 ’s hold on @entity14 or @entity10 ’s even more blatant hold on @entity11			1
@entity19 chose to stick to his belief that you are remembered for what you give and not what you miss or ignore and that was a major disappointment to all neutrals who are fed up with this continual holding at set pieces			0
