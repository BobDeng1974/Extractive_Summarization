@entity0 sank to his knees at the end of five hard days of @entity3 , barely able to believe that he could not penetrate the defences of @entity5 and take @entity6 to what would have been an extraordinary lord ’s victory			1
@entity11 ’s last man , who had comically fallen on to his own wicket in the first innings , had somehow kept out the last five balls of the match to keep @entity0 and @entity6 at bay and earn his side the most hard fought and dramatic of draws			1
@entity5 , with a @entity19 average of five , had been given out when the penultimate ball thudded into his pads to cue wild @entity23 celebrations but @entity25 ’s decision was overturned when the review made it painfully clear that ball had struck bat before pad			2
@entity6 ’s ecstasy soon turned to agony at 6.45pm on the final day but when the dust settles on this first @entity19 they will surely acknowledge that @entity11 deserved to hang on after playing a full part in what became a wonderful advertisement for the ultimate form of the game			2
that they took six of them and were only denied the seventh by the correct intervention of technology was a monumental effort and one that should provide further encouragement in their attempts to recover from their @entity71 disaster			0
@entity6 will look back and wonder what might have been had they declared on the fourth evening or , more pertinently , if both sides had not been guilty of tardy over-rates which meant 17 overs were shamefully lost over the first four days			0
yet it would be churlish to blame @entity39 for a near miss that owed everything to a magnificent effort from @entity6 ’s four - man pace attack who gave their all in conditions that were more akin to @entity86 than @entity87			0
danger man : @entity89 celebrates the wicket of @entity91 top of the stumps : @entity91 was bowled for 61 with the first of @entity89 's wickets nicked : @entity89 captures the edge of @entity96 and it lands safely in @entity97 's gloves how @entity6 would have loved to have had @entity99 in their ranks after giving themselves all day to bowl out @entity11 knowing the visitors would have to make history if they were to reach their unlikely victory target of 390			1
life after one of their greatest spinners was never going to be easy and @entity6 will have to rely on pace while @entity109 develops as a replacement or @entity111 gets his head together in time to face @entity113 next month			0
at least , in @entity89 and @entity0 , @entity6 have two world - class fast bowlers who took seven of the nine wickets to fall on monday , @entity89 returning to his very best in claiming three wickets for one run either side of tea			2
and with debutant @entity124 taking the other two , including what seemed the key victim in @entity127 just ahead of the new ball , it looked as though @entity6 would get away with their lack of a spin specialist			0
breakthrough : @entity0 claimed the first wicket on day five with a short ball claiming @entity134 safe hands : @entity136 ( left ) took the catch at short leg as opening bowler @entity0 got the ball rolling not messing about : @entity134 walks off after scoring 16 in 24 balls , including three boundaries @entity6 575 - 9 dec ( @entity40 200 no , prior 86 , @entity143 56 , @entity5 4 - 123 ) & 267 - 8 dec ( @entity144 104 no , @entity145 4 - 95 ) @entity11 453 ( @entity91 147 , @entity146 102 , @entity147 63 , @entity96 55 ) & 201 - 9 ( @entity91 61 , @entity147 57 , @entity89 4 - 25 ) @entity6 drew with @entity11 certainly when @entity145 gloved @entity0 to @entity97 at the start of the last over and did not hang around for @entity25 ’s decision even though replays suggested his hand was off his bat handle at the moment the ball touched his glove , @entity6 felt the @entity3 and a 1 - 0 lead with one to play in @entity156 was theirs			1
it was not to be			0
the final day had appeared an exercise in frustration as @entity147 and @entity91 initially repelled everything @entity6 could throw at them but @entity89 ( right ) summoned up the spirit of @entity163 last season to provide one last twist to a fluctuating tale			1
the leader of @entity6 ’s attack - now 33 behind sir @entity170 ’s all - time @entity19 wicket - taking record of 383 - took out the big two in @entity91 and @entity172 plus the man he has now dismissed 10 times in test cricket in @entity176			1
hot streak : @entity89 celebrates the wicket of @entity176 , his first of two in a single over on the charge : @entity176 edges the delivery of a rampant @entity89 and @entity124 takes the catch getting settled : @entity6 could n't remove first innings centurion @entity185 in the first session personal milestone : @entity91 acknowledges the crowd as he reaches his 50 suddenly , out of nowhere , @entity6 were in sight of victory			1
yet such was @entity11 ’s defiance through @entity192 , who batted with a broken finger , and captain @entity146 that two wickets were still needed from that last over , @entity39 going back from the wicketless @entity197 to his big gun in @entity0			1
it was @entity0 who almost completed a thrilling win , @entity5 taking advantage of his reprieve by edging the final delivery just in front of @entity206 at second slip			2
both he and @entity11 survived in tact ahead of friday ’s second test			2
it would be simplistic to say @entity6 would have won had they declared on sunday because , with their own wickets falling regularly on the fourth day , they were never really in a position to do so			0
another start : @entity11 's @entity147 ( right ) passed the half century mark for the second time this match going up : @entity217 , @entity206 , @entity39 and @entity143 appeal for the wicket of @entity134 scratchy : despite some shaky moments , @entity147 backed up his first innings 63 with 57 in his second dig gone : @entity124 claims the wicket of @entity147 with prior claiming his first catch of the day after it was reviewed only when @entity217 had averted the possibility of an @entity6 defeat and launched a counter-attack which saw 59 runs come off the last seven overs of the fourth day could @entity39 be satisfied that he had enough runs to guarantee against defeat			1
both the timing of his declaration and his tactics on the final day , which saw attacking and unusual field placings , could not be faulted			0
in the end it was @entity239 ’s pitch that just about had the final say and both teams will be satisfied with their efforts as they head to @entity243 to do it all again in three days time			0
the game was drawn and the @entity6 captain should not be hung and quartered by his critics because of that			0
captain 's knock : @entity146 dug in on day five as @entity6 pushed to claim 10 wickets on watch : @entity39 's captaincy came under intense scrutiny after he declared before the start of play confident : @entity40 , @entity206 and @entity0 appeal for @entity258 against p @entity127 key scalp : @entity146 scored 18 runs but more importantly survived 89 balls in the final session of the match safe hands : @entity39 's catch claims the wicket of @entity11 skipper @entity146 which put the match in the balance anguish : @entity0 reacts after bowling the final ball of the match			1
