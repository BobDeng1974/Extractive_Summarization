jewellery tycoon : @entity1 was made a peer because he is a ' leading figure ' among @entity4 he 's the @entity6 donor who was made a peer because he is a ‘ leading figure ’ among @entity4			1
the only problem is , other prominent sikhs say they have never heard of @entity1			0
the jewellery tycoon – dubbed the @entity12 – was elevated to the @entity13 by @entity14 last week after giving the @entity6 £ 310,000			1
@entity6 chiefs dismissed cries of ‘ cash for peerages ’ by saying he was a pillar of the @entity4 community			1
but yesterday there was embarrassment for the party when the @entity4 community begged to differ			1
‘ we have not come across this individual before , ’ said @entity24 , secretary general of the @entity25 , the largest @entity4 representative body in the country			2
‘ the first time i heard of him was when his name was mentioned [ as a new peer ]			0
’ @entity35 , 79 , was described by @entity36 as a businessman and ‘ former general secretary of the @entity39 ’			2
but records show the @entity39 has not existed for more than 20 years			0
it ran for just two years and involved only four or five people			0
according to documents at @entity45 , it was incorporated in 1990 and dissolved two years later , with insiders telling @entity47 it ‘ fizzled out ’ after a couple of meetings			0
@entity6 claims that the donor had ‘ leading ’ status within his community were dismissed as a ‘ barefaced lie ’ by another prominent @entity4 organisation			1
the @entity56 ( @entity57 ) said in a statement : ‘ he is no leading figure in @entity57 ’s @entity4 community and he is not associated with any of the leading @entity4 organisations			1
many in the @entity4 community simply see @entity35 as a businessman who has donated large sums of money [ to the @entity67 ]			1
’ action : he was elevated to the @entity13 by @entity14 ( pictured ) after giving the @entity67 £ 310,000 it added : ‘ @entity71 has been campaigning for over a decade for more visible @entity4 in @entity72			1
on the one hand this move is welcome , but we would prefer each of the main political parties to have @entity4 in the @entity13 who are younger , there on merit and based on what they have to offer rather than those who are seen as “ cronies ”			1
’ there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of @entity35 , who was a magistrate for more than a decade			2
he built @entity89 into an international success story after establishing it in 1976 and in 2009 his family ’s fortune was estimated to be £ 40million			2
claims : @entity24 ( pictured ) , secretary general of the @entity25 , said ' we have not come across this individual before ' he is now one of @entity57 ’s richest @entity96 who has regularly featured in the @entity97			0
a member of the @entity99 , an exclusive dinner club open only to those who have donated more than £ 10,000 to the party , he has been an active member of the @entity6 for more than 30 years and describes mr @entity14 as ‘ delightful and a good leader ’			1
however , @entity104 mp @entity103 said last night : ‘ there are questions to answer here , not least for the government who , on elevating this @entity6 donor to the @entity13 , justified it on the basis that he held a post which does n’t seem to have existed for over a decade			1
’ she questioned whether the suitability of the appointment was discussed with the @entity116 , which vets nominations for new peerages			0
‘ people will rightly want to get to the bottom of this issue before another @entity6 donor is sworn in to the @entity13 , ’ she added			2
the @entity123 said its job was limited to checking an individual ’s ‘ propriety ’			0
a spokesman stressed : ‘ assessing the suitability of those nominated by political parties is a matter for the parties themselves			0
’ lord @entity1 ’s peerage will lead to further calls for the controversial system of patronage to be scrapped			0
the prime minister has now handed out more than 180 peerages , swelling the total to 850 – making the @entity13 bigger than at any time since most hereditary seats were removed in 1999			2
a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ beyond his extensive career in business , @entity144 has devoted the last 40 years to a range of charitable and voluntary positions , including general secretary of the @entity39 in 1991/92			0
’ lord @entity1 ’s office said he was unavailable for comment			0
but a family friend said : ‘ he is a prominent member of the @entity4 community , because he is rich , but he is not a leader of it , and nor would he ever claim to be			1
‘ he is an extremely humble man who arrived as an immigrant from @entity157 in 1973 with very little and worked hard to build himself a business			0
