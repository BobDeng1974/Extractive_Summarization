by @entity1 reporter the government wants to recoup benefits paid to the daughters of a man who was declared legally dead and then turned up alive years later			1
@entity6 disappeared in the 1980s , and a death ruling in 1994 allowed his family to get @entity10 benefits			1
when the 62 - year - old @entity6 resurfaced around 2005 - some 25 years after his disappearance - saying he had lived in other states and then returned to @entity14 , the government apparently took notice			1
@entity6 has tried unsuccessfully to ' undo ' his death			2
then there were three : @entity18 , ( left ) pictured here not long after the disappearance of husband @entity6 in 1980 , says her family should not have to pay back the death benefits they received after he was declared legally dead even as he stood in court last year providing evidence of his existence , a @entity24 judge turned down a request to ' bring him back to life ' , citing a three - year limit for changing a death ruling			1
the judge did acknowledge it was problematic			0
now the @entity34 know that @entity6 is alive , it wants his two daughters to return more than $ 47,000 to cover benefits they received as teenagers , plus interest , his ex-wife , @entity18 , told @entity40 in @entity41			1
both daughters are now adults with their own families			0
@entity18 has not spoken of what happened to the money			0
letters about the requested repayments were sent in april , and the family was stunned , she said			0
' if anybody has to pay this back , it should be him because we did n't do anything wrong , ' she said			0
@entity6 , of @entity54 , could n't be reached for comment , and his attorney did n't return calls from the newspaper			2
today : @entity18 has since remarried - to a man whose surname is also @entity6 - and is believed to have had another child , a son a @entity10 spokesman , @entity62 in @entity63 , said the agency is reviewing @entity18 's application for a waiver			1
@entity18 said the family did n't defraud the government and had taken steps to find @entity6 after he vanished , including contacting the @entity70 and hiring a private investigator			2
' we honestly thought he was done , dead , gone and out of our lives , ' she said			0
@entity6 remarried after the disappearance of her first husband and is believed to have had another child , a son			2
she has expressed sympathy for @entity6 , describing him as a ' deadbeat dad ' who ran away from the pressures of family and fatherhood .			0

@entity83 , 62 , of @entity54 , @entity14 , *skipped* out on his family in the 1980s
he was *fleeing* child support payments , his family said
in 1994 he was declared legally dead and his two daughters received $ 47,000 from his @entity10
he resurfaced around 2005 , saying he had been living in @entity91 and @entity92
however a judge *refused* to undo his death , citing a three - year limit for *overturning* a death ruling
but the @entity34 believe @entity6 is alive and is demanding the $ 47,000 be returned
