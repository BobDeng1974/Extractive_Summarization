by @entity1 reporter published : 23:09 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : 05:55 est , 27 february 2014 married couples and civil partners could make a binding agreement about how their property or finances should be shared if their relationship breaks down a so - called ' prenup ' law that allows a couple to set the terms of a divorce before they get married has been put forward by the government 's law reform advisers			1
under the current law , couples can make pre- and post-nuptial agreements but they are not binding and the parties can not be certain they will be upheld			1
a report from the @entity22 , @entity23 , includes a draft @entity24 which , if implemented , would bring legally - recognised ' qualifying nuptial agreements ' into effect			1
they would enable married couples and civil partners to make a binding agreement about how their property or finances should be shared if their relationship breaks down , the @entity22 said			1
professor @entity30 , law commissioner for property , family and trust law , said : ' pre- and post-nuptial agreements are becoming more commonplace but the courts will not always follow them and lawyers are therefore not able to give clear advice about their effect			1
' qualifying nuptial agreements would give couples autonomy and control , and make the financial outcome of separation more predictable			1
we have built in safeguards to ensure that they can not be used to impose hardship on either party , nor to escape responsibility for children or to burden the state			0
' as part of a package of measures , the @entity22 has also recommended that the @entity57 , the non-statutory advisory body made up of representatives from the family justice system , produces guidance on financial needs			2
guidance would explain the outcome a judge would aim for in determining a settlement , including achieving eventual financial independence			0
ms @entity30 added : ' we believe that married couples and civil partners should have the power to decide their own financial arrangements , but should not be able to contract out of their responsibilities for each other 's financial needs , or for their children			2
guidance would explain the outcome a judge would aim for in determining a settlement , including achieving eventual financial independence			0
' the measures we are recommending would help couples understand and meet their financial responsibilities and , where appropriate , achieve financial independence			2
' @entity82 family lawyer @entity81 said : ' @entity84 recommendations are to be welcomed for their potential to reduce conflict and costs for those who are seeking to end their marriage or civil partnership			0
' but it is vital that any changes in this area must recognise that family law , and particularly divorce and separation settlements , are inherently complex - a couple with no children who is seeking to end their marriage or civil partnership after five years will have very different needs to those who have been married for 15 years with three children			1
' so long as we avoid a one - size - fits - all approach to this area of the law and continue to recognise that every couple , and indeed family , is different , then i think these recommendations could potentially lead to a smoother and more cost effective separation process for many couples			2
' @entity111 , senior partner at @entity112 , said : ' these measures are perfect			0
while the @entity22 does not recommend radical change , it has recognised what family lawyers already know			2
' because of the economic situation and the government 's demolition of family law legal aid , fewer people are able to access professional legal advice			0
as a result , confusion abounds and it is now necessary to provide additional information and ' simplify ' the current system			0
' she added : ' although the @entity22 is recommending that prenuptial agreements should become binding in law , it also proposes rigid criteria			1
' for example , a prenup would only be binding once both partners ' financial needs and financial responsibilities towards their children had been met			0
this means that an unscrupulous spouse would be unable to ' contract out ' of providing for their children			0

under current law , couples can make pre- and post-nuptial agreements but they are not binding and the parties can not be certain they will be upheld
a draft @entity24 , if implemented , would bring legally - recognised ' qualifying nuptial agreements ' into effect and allow a couple to set the terms of a divorce
@entity22 says law could allow couples to decide how their property or finances should be shared if their relationship breaks down
