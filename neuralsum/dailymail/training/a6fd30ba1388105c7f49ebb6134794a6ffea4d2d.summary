by @entity0 we are coming to the end of our @entity4 filming for made in @entity0 and after nearly two months in the @entity5 we thought it might be an idea if we saw the famous sights of the city			1
so we trawled the usual tourist traps and where else to start but the @entity11			0
we popped up to the 86th floor viewing gallery with several of the other cast members - @entity0 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18			1
i thought about re-creating the famous scene from @entity21 in @entity22 with me as @entity23 and @entity0 as @entity24 , but there were too many people around and we did n't have a rucksack with a teddy bear in it			1
do n't get me wrong we have had an amazing time over here but we are looking forward to being back in the @entity46			2
also there are times when living with @entity0 can be a bit testing – it 's like trying to keep an energetic @entity52 puppy in a small flat			1
he 's cute and loveable but he bounces off the walls with his boundless energy			2
he 's also a bit of prankster and thought it was hilarious recently to raid my bedroom when i was asleep and film it			2
i 've got to say i had a bit of a sense of humour failure at the time			2
missing @entity63 ? the cast paid a visit to the @entity11 @entity4 know how to do retail			1
when we open a shop in the @entity46 , someone cuts a bit of ribbon and everyone claps , takes a picture and that 's it			0
it 's a bit different in the @entity5 , they turn the volume up to 11			0
we were invited to a new beauty store opening on @entity81 by hair care range @entity82 and this certainly was n't a dull affair			0
the room was packed with top models in bikinis , myself and @entity17 fitted right in and made some new friends along the way			0
party on : @entity0 and @entity17 went to the @entity93 launch party and fitted right in with a sea of bikini - clad models on the downside , the diet has gone right out of the window			1
we are currently living off oversized @entity4 deli sandwiches and doughnuts			1
my flirtation with @entity103 frosted donuts has now become a full - blown love affair – and they contain fifteen grams of fat , 280 calories and 14 grams of sugar – it would take a 20 - minute fairly high intensity run to burn off just one of those babies			0
we have been doing some work - outs and using the @entity114 to help burn the fat but we are planning to up the ante when we get back and so we 've booked ourselves in to no 1 @entity116 in @entity117 for the end of july			0
the strict former @entity121 instructors there should whip us into shape for summer back in the @entity46			0
lots of @entity125 , @entity126			0
sweet treat : @entity0 says it 's hard to stick to a diet with so many foodie temptations in @entity4			1

@entity0 and the gang are approaching the end of filming in @entity4
although he 's had a great time the @entity0 star is ready to come home
he jokes that living so close to @entity0 has become *grating*
