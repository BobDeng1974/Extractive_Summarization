no snarl is more famous			0
eyes squinting , mouth contorted , 15 - year - old @entity1 became the face of racial intolerance during the civil rights movement in 1957			2
it was the first day of school for @entity10 students in @entity11 , @entity12 , where nine black students would be admitted for the first time in history			1
joining her jeering white classmates , @entity1 swarmed behind @entity17 , a new black pupil			1
pushing her way to the front , she was overheard by a @entity21 reporter : ' go back to @entity22 ! ' as she spat those words , @entity23 took the infamous picture printed in the next day 's edition of the @entity12 @entity27 - as well as almost every national newspaper around the world			1
the picture swept the world and symbolized racial tensions almost 70 years later , in a moving book that interviews both figures in the symbolic image , it has emerged that was just the start of the journey for @entity17 and @entity1 - who came close to reconciliation before it all broke down once more			1
the pair appeared smiling together in 1997 in front of @entity48 , where then - president @entity49 spoke for the 40th anniversary of the school 's integration			1
but it was not quite the triumphant rapprochement touted			0
' @entity1 was thrilled , @entity17 , curious , ' writes author @entity55 in an extract from @entity17 and @entity1 : two women of @entity11 published by @entity58			1
the five years that followed saw the two women courted by historians , analysts , politicians , broadcasters - all wanting a slice of their story			0
rapprochement ? the classmates were reunited in 1997 for the 40th anniversary in an apparent reconciliation @entity71 : in 1957 , the first black students were admitted to @entity48 ( left - right ) @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity17 , and @entity80			1
the reunited for the 40th anniversary they even appeared on @entity83 , who did not hide her distaste of their friendship			0
@entity1 's face had epitomized the three - week struggle at @entity90 , when governor @entity91 blocked nine black students from enrolling at a high school with about 2,000 white students			1
in september 1957 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity80 , @entity17 , @entity79 , @entity78 , @entity75 , @entity74 , and @entity73 arrived at the school , having applied and been accepted to join			1
the @entity96 had declared segregated classrooms unconstitutional in 1954			0
@entity98 voted to integrate - but @entity91 said he feared violence if the races mixed in a public school			0
in a battle that involved president @entity105 , the @entity103 's @entity102 were deployed to man the situation			0
two sides to a difficult story : a book by author @entity55 looks at how both women dealt with fame in the wake of that photograph that swept the globe however , cracks appeared during an interview where @entity1 revealed she had never dedicated much thought to the incendiary image of her 15 - year - old self - a revelation which shocked and devastated @entity17			1
on september 11 , 2001 , they spoke for the last time before cutting ties			0
meeting both women , now in their 70s , @entity55 heard two sides of the story			2
@entity1 , who still resides in @entity11 decided soon after the incident to read up on her ignorance ; she helped black women in broken marriages ; studied @entity131 's speeches ; listened to reports of racially - aggravated attacks on the radio			1
@entity17 , on the other hand , had struggled through deaths and destitution			2
' with enormous courage and resiliency , @entity17 ultimately made a life for herself and has largely come to peace with her past , ' @entity55 writes			2
' paradoxically , it ’s been @entity1 , who has led a life of far greater financial and familial security , who now feels wounded and angry			2
' after leaving school at 17 , marrying , and having kids , @entity1 was desperate to atone : ' one day , she realized , her children would learn that that snarling girl in their history books was their mother			1
she realized she had an account to settle			0
' aged 20 , @entity1 called @entity17 to tearfully apologize , opening the gates for a highly - publicized relationship to form			1
but it was plagued with issues			0
though @entity1 helped @entity17 to work through her issues and find a job , @entity17 felt uneasy about their relationship and uncertain about @entity1 's attempts to make up for her bullying			1
their posed picture did not betray the awkwardness between them , @entity55 explains , and over the years they would struggle when questioned about their new - found friendship			0
in 1998 , an interviewer asked @entity1 about the image and she said she never gave it much thought			2
the image was n't discussed , she claimed			0
@entity17 was shocked and expressed her disappointment			2
finally , it was @entity1 that severed ties as she felt an irreconcilable tension between them			1
but @entity55 suggests it is not over			0
he writes : ' each , i noticed , teared up at references to the other			0
perhaps , when no one is looking — or taking any pictures — they ’ll yet come together again			0
and if they can , maybe , so too , can we			0
