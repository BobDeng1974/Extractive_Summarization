store total @entity39 morrisons £ 23.07 £ 2.88 @entity8 £ 24.89 £ 3.11 @entity41 £ 25.78 £ 3.22 @entity42 £ 27.44 £ 3.43 the co-op £ 29.71 £ 3.71 @entity43 £ 30.74 £ 3.84 @entity44 ’s £ 31.36 £ 3.92 @entity45 £ 45.36 £ 5.67 waitrose £ 60.58 £ 7.57 while such luxuries as chipolatas , cauliflower cheese , bread sauce and @entity52 puddings are not allowed for , the baskets do include cranberry sauce , sage and onion stuffing , and a selection of puddings including @entity5 cake , @entity5 pud and mince pies as well as brandy butter			1
@entity1 takes the crown for the second year running , with its festive food basket of eleven different @entity5 essentials coming to a total of just £ 23.07			1
the basket , which is the same across all the stores , includes items such as a turkey , @entity71 sprouts and potatoes along with mince pies , two @entity5 puddings and brandy butter			0
the basket from @entity1 comes in at £ 37.51 less than a similar basket from the most expensive shop on the list , @entity80			1

winning the cut - price war : @entity1 is offering the cheapest festive basket for the second year in a row @entity43 's elevated basket prices comes largely because they have upped the quality of the items they are selling in their standard basket , a spokesman for @entity29 said today			1
' the potatoes from @entity43 , for example , are " specially selected for goose fat roasting " while the parsnips are " honey glazed ’ " compared to the bog standard of both which most other supermarkets are selling in their most basic range			0
' the consumer expert at @entity109 says that while the vegetables are roughly similar for most shops it is the larger items , such as the turkey or the @entity5 cake , which make the most difference to the cost of the basket			2
' at @entity80 , for example , where the bill comes to £ 60.58 or £ 7.57 per head , the cost of the turkey is significantly more			2
' this is because it ’s priced by weight and it is free range			2
@entity45 is also the only other supermarket which has a fresh turkey included			0
' @entity132 : the shopping bills for each supermarket are not identical as the weights and varieties are not always the same			0
