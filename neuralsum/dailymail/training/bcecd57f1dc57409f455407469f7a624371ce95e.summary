a corrections computer system recorded that @entity13 's bracelet stopped working on march 14 , according to documents released on tuesday			1
officers learned he had fled on march 19 , the day @entity6 prison chief @entity15 was fatally shot as he answered the front door at his home			1
the detail is the latest example of how @entity13 fell through the cracks of the criminal justice system in the years before his january release			1
on monday , court officials acknowledged that a clerical error allowed @entity13 to leave prison four years early because his most recent felony conviction was incorrectly recorded on his record			1
victim : @entity30 , left , was shot by @entity13 , a convict that was accidentally released early from prison and now @entity30 's widow @entity32 ( right ) is speaking out for the first time heartbroken : mrs @entity34 said that she does n't know what to tell her twin daughters who lost their father because of a ' clerical error ' that let a felon go free far too early happier days : @entity32 and @entity30 , seen here on their wedding day , have twin girls who are 4 - years - old police believe that @entity13 killed @entity46 delivery man @entity30 in @entity47 just days before he killed @entity6 prison chief @entity15			1
the widow of the pizza delivery man who was killed by a ex-convict who was accidentally released early from prison four years early is furious with authorities for dismissing his death as a ' clerical error			1
' @entity30 's widow said that the impersonal apology from the state - that @entity30 's family only heard about through the media - would n't cut it for the death of her husband and the father of her twin girls			2
worrying : officials said that @entity13 , pictured , was released from jail in january four years early ' it ai n't going to bring @entity15 back			1
it 's not going to bring my children 's father back			0
how do i tell my 4 - year - olds , " @entity72 was murdered because of a clerical error " ? @entity34 said			0

however , the judge did not say the sentence was meant to be ' consecutive , ' or in addition to , @entity13 's current one			2
so the court clerk recorded it as one to be served ' concurrently ' or at the same time			0
that 's the information that went to the state prisons , the statement said			0
on january 28 , prisons officials saw that @entity13 had finished his court - ordered sentence and released him			1

the gun he used in the gun battle was the same one used to shoot and kill mr @entity15 two days earlier			1
victims : police believe @entity13 also was involved in the death of a @entity46 delivery man , @entity30 , left , in @entity47			1

the statement , which mrs @entity34 says they never were given directly , does not assuage any of their anger over the situation			0
injured : @entity13 was first pulled over by @entity129 sheriff 's deputy @entity128 , pictured , before he was shot by police in the @entity103 shootout ' we want to know who is going to stand up and be accountable			1

' we commend both the 11th @entity86 and the @entity150 for reviewing their own internal processes and procedures , ' governor @entity148 's spokeswoman @entity147 said in a written statement			0
the attack that led to the plea deal took place in 2006			0
according to prison and court records , @entity13 slipped out of handcuffs while being transferred from a cell and punched a prison officer in the face			2
he bloodied the officer 's nose and finger , and threatened to kill the officer 's family			0
' if mr. @entity13 was prosecuted for an assault on an officer , it had to be pretty severe , because in the course of day - to - day work , correctional officers are regularly assaulted or threatened , ' said @entity175 commissioner @entity174 , who is executive director of the correctional officer group @entity176 death : this picture shows the scene of the crash and shootout which killed @entity13 father and son : @entity184 , pictured with his son , raised @entity186 in a middle - class @entity47 suburb			1

' it 's a tragic clerical error			0
' @entity13 spent much of his time behind bars in solitary confinement and had a long record of disciplinary violations			2
records show he joined a white supremacist prison gang			0
@entity13 's early release was just the latest twist in a case full of painful ironies			0
