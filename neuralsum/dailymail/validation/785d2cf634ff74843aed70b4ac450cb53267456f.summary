his performances for both @entity31 and @entity32 are exceptional			0
@entity28 makes a penalty save from @entity35 in the 2012 @entity4 semi-final defenders @entity38 was such a leader for @entity7			1
that is not to take anything away from his ability as a defender , but he was as important in the dressing room as he was on the field			0
@entity7 legend @entity38 lifts the @entity4 after their win over @entity49 in the 2009 final @entity51 very similar to how @entity38 was for @entity7 , @entity51 was the leader of @entity11 and is still doing it now			1
when he does decide to retire , he will be so hard for @entity11 to replace			0
@entity51 lifts the famous trophy after @entity11 's win over @entity32 in 2012 @entity55 one of my best moments is winning the @entity4 with him , then it was great to play with him again all those years later at @entity11			2
without doubt he is the classiest defender i have ever played with			0
@entity55 carries @entity61 after @entity5 's triumph in the 2004 @entity4 final midfield @entity64 @entity64 was a really tough competitor ; he would always let you know he was there			2
he was n’t just tough though , he had a really excellent range of passing			0
@entity64 guided @entity68 to the @entity4 final last season @entity71 it is not coincidence so many professionals talk so highly of @entity71			2
of course he is one of the best midfield players of my @entity4 , but also i think you can call him one of the best midfield players in the history of the game			0
@entity71 won the @entity4 for the second time when @entity49 beat @entity11 in 2008 @entity83 at the peak of @entity7 he was at the centre of everything that was good about @entity7			1
maybe the other players got more headlines , but @entity83 was the catalyst for it all			0
@entity83 takes on @entity49 's @entity91 during the 2011 final at @entity93 @entity94 the one player of my generation i wish i could have played with			2
just a fantastic player in every single way			0
@entity94 scores his famous volley as @entity101 beat @entity102 in the 2002 final attack @entity104 @entity104 is a natural born talent , that is not to say he does n’t work hard , but you ca n’t teach what he can do him and @entity35 are actually i think very different , but at the moment they are the two best in the world			2
@entity104 lifts the trophy for the third time after @entity7 's 2011 win over @entity49 @entity35 what a lot of people do n’t see is just how hard @entity35 has worked to get where he is , he is the ultimate professional			1
of course he has natural ability , but not many people know how hard he has worked to be voted the best player in the world			0
@entity35 celebrates after scoring for @entity101 in last season 's @entity4 final @entity125 i always remember when we ( @entity7 ) would go two or three goals up , and @entity129 would start to enjoy himself			1
he done things that you just think are not possible with a football , he is the best i have ever played with			0
