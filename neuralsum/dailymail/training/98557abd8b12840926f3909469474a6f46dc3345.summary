by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:14 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 18:19 est , 7 august 2013 ' disgrace ' : barrister @entity3 has been criticised by campaigners for describing a 13 - year - old victim of a sex abuse case ' predatory ' @entity8 yesterday condemned a prosecution barrister for describing the 13 - year - old victim of a paedophile as sexually ‘ predatory ’			1
he urged the courts to ‘ stand up for victims ’ after @entity18 , 41 , escaped jail despite luring the girl to his home , where she performed a sex act on him			1
child protection campaigners labelled barrister @entity3 a ‘ disgrace ’ and called for his dismissal			1
they also warned that his ‘ crass ’ comments would stop other young abuse victims from coming forward			1
mr @entity3 has been suspended from prosecuting sex trials after he told @entity26 in @entity27 that the girl ‘ forced ’ herself on @entity18 , describing her as ‘ predatory in all her actions ’ and ‘ sexually experienced ’			1
he said : ‘ she appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15 - year - old			1
there was sexual activity but it was not of mr @entity18 ’s doing			1
‘ you might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her			1
’ judge @entity40 , @entity41 , is also being investigated for telling @entity18 the girl was ‘ egging you on ’ and that she looked and behaved ‘ a little bit older ’ than her age as he gave him a suspended sentence			1
@entity18 admitted two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child			2
his own solicitor told monday ’s sentencing hearing that the paedophile could still pose a risk to children			2
in a separate move , it emerged that sex offence trials involving vulnerable children will be conducted by a newly chosen team of specially vetted judges , to protect child witnesses from brutal cross-examination by trial barristers			1
under fire : judge @entity40 is also being investigated for suggesting the victim was ' egging on ' paedophile @entity18 @entity18 spotted his victim amid the bustle of @entity71 town centre at the start of march last year			2
the 13 - year - old girl was playing truant from school and wandering the streets asking strangers for cigarettes			2
@entity18 obliged when she asked him – offering her an entire packet			2
he then took her back to his flat near the town centre for coffee			2
the girl allegedly looked around 14 or 15 and acted as if she was older than her years			2
however , she was clearly underage – and nearly three decades younger than @entity18 who was 39 at the time			2
over the next two weeks the pair enjoyed a brief ‘ fling ’ , @entity84 heard			2
the girl was described by the prosecutor and judge as a ‘ sexual predator ’			2
but during this time it was @entity18 who bombarded her with phone calls and text messages as she continued to visit his home , the court heard			2
on march 20 , exactly two weeks after her first visit , the girl went back to @entity18 ’s flat after they agreed to meet			2
they sat in his lounge and talked about their relationship			0
@entity18 claims at this point he told her they had to stop seeing each other because they would get in trouble			0
the girl , who was dressed in her school uniform , asked if she could change out of it and @entity18 left the room			0
when he returned she had undressed and was sat wearing a t - shirt			0
@entity18 claims he asked her to put her clothes on , but she started kissing him before touching his genitals			0
he said he pushed her away and told her he did not want to see her any more			0
at no point did they have sex			1
@entity3 , prosecuting , told the court that the sexual activity was ‘ not of mr @entity18 ’s doing ’			1
he added : ‘ you might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her			0
’ the abuse came to light only when the girl told a friend what happened and the police were called			0
when officers went to @entity18 ’s home , they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer			0
four of the images were surreptitiously taken photographs of children in play areas or other safe environments showing either underwear or varying degrees of nakedness			0
there were also 11 sexually explicit images involving horses and dogs			0
@entity18 told police that he watched hardcore pornography but that he had deleted it from his computer			0
yesterday the prime minister said it was ‘ absolutely right ’ that the @entity157 had rebuked mr @entity3 for his comments			1
he said : ‘ it is n’t appropriate			0
we need a criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims			0
the victims should always be at the centre of our thinking			0
‘ the cps themselves have said that this is n’t appropriate , the attorney general is going to look into the case and we need a system that properly stands up for victims			1
’ @entity170 , director of child protection charity @entity171 , said : ‘ this needs to be nipped in the bud			0
are we in 1913 or 2013 ? judges and barristers should be removed if they use language like this			0
‘ vulnerable witnesses wo n’t come forward if they are going to be treated this way in court			0
they are fragile children , they are not just pieces of evidence to be used in a case			1
' @entity185 , @entity186 ’s shadow attorney general , said : ‘ it is appalling that after the scandals of @entity191 and @entity192 these awful @entity189 prejudices are still being served up in court , and by the prosecution of all people			0
’ she has written to the @entity196 to examine whether mr @entity3 violated its code of conduct			1
investigation : the @entity157 has launched a probe following the case at @entity84 @entity203 also condemned the teenager ’s treatment			1
its chief executive @entity206 said : ‘ it is completely unacceptable for victims to be blamed in any way for the abuse they have suffered			0
‘ the state owes a duty of care to victims and witnesses , which in this case appears to have been woefully neglected			1
we have strenuously campaigned for cultural change to this often adversarial , aggressive courts system			0
’ there was further anger yesterday as a high profile human rights lawyer appeared to defend the prosecutor ’s comments			1
@entity226 , a barrister for @entity227 , tweeted : ‘ it takes two to tango			0
disgusting tho ’ these men are , frankly the girls are often not much better – and no shrieking martyrs			0
’ the @entity157 said : ‘ the word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the @entity157			1
the director of public prosecutions will be undertaking a review of this case to determine what happened and to decide what action needs to be taken			1
the attorney general ’s office said the case had been drawn to its attention ‘ as a possibly unduly lenient sentence ’			1
the @entity245 said it would consider a number of complaints it had received about judge @entity40 ’s remarks			0
there was no answer at mr @entity3 ’s £ 900,000 home in @entity254 , @entity27 , yesterday .			1

@entity3 labelled a ' disgrace ' by campaigners after comments
suspended from prosecuting sex trials and @entity157 investigation launched
