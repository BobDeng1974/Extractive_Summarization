the invention of the washing machine was a revolutionary moment for women			1
no longer did entire days have to be dedicated to the tedious and physically exhausting task of scrubbing the family 's laundry			0
however , modern washing machines are far from eco-friendly			0
so what 's the carbon - conscious consumer to do ? if you 've got a lot of energy , the ‘ @entity15 ’ , which requires you to physically spin the clothes yourself , could be the answer			2
the @entity17 requires you to do the manual work by spinning your dirty washing in a drum grubby clothes are placed in an inner drum - makers say you can wash delicates in the @entity15 too you add about 1.5 gallons of water alongside a normal detergent , leave to soak , then spin now eco-warriors can clean a ( small amount ) of clothing and simultaneously feel they are doing their bit to save the planet , using what can only be described as giant salad spinner			1
the concept is simple ; you place your clothes ( delicates can also be included ) into the @entity15 and add about 1.5 gallons of water along with a small amount of normal detergent			1
you then secure the lid and leave the washing to soak for two or three minutes			0
a handle pops up from the lid , allowing you to spin the drum , manually washing the clothes			2
@entity45 through spinning you take out the drainage hose and the soapy water runs out			0
you then have to repeat this process again with fresh batch of clean water to rinse the clothes , and the makers suggest that you ‘ spin fast ’ to ensure as much of the water as possible is drained off			2
clothes can then be hung and dried as normal			0
the @entity15 comes in white , green and silver and is available to buy online for $ 99.95 ( about £ 63 )			1
so it 's a whole heap cheaper than a conventional washer / drier - and , as it 's not plugged into the mains , it wo n't add to your electricity bills either			0
conventional washers use a lot of power and up to 50 gallons of water with each load , while the @entity15 uses less than 5 gallons of water and no electricity			1
each wash needs less than five gallons of water , while most washing machines need around 50 gallons the hose , stored inside the @entity15 , allows for drainage while it may be a stretch to imagine that men and women will embrace the @entity15 ’s hands - on washing for all their clothes , it is easy to see this revolutionising the tedium of hand - wash only items			1
getting your wool and delicate items clean can now be earth - friendly and give you an upper arm workout at the same time ! the @entity15 looks remarkably like a huge salad spinner			0

@entity15 needs under 5 gallons of water per wash and no electricity
average washing machine needs over 50 gallons of water
you manually spin the clothes to wash and rinse them
available in green , white and silver to buy online for about £ 63
