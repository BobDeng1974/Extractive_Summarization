scientists have claimed that our best chance of finding alien life is not looking for living animal organisms but rather plant life			1
two astrophysicists have said we should be looking at exoplanets for signatures of chlorophyll , which plants use to convert sunlight into energy			0
and they say this could be done by a future telescope planned by @entity15 to study habitable exoplanets			1
@entity18 scientists have suggested looking for chlorophyll on exoplanets			1
they say if found this would be a strong indicator a planet has vegetation			1
this in turn would suggest it has plant life - and maybe animals as well			1
this could be performed by a future @entity15 telescope called @entity32 @entity18 astrophysicists dr @entity33 and dr @entity35 made the suggestions in a paper called ' prospects for detecting oxygen , water and chlorophyll on an exo - @entity42			1
' they say that it might be possible to detect signatures of water , oxygen and chlorophyll on an alien planet			2
one hundred million worlds in our galaxy are able to host alien life , according to a ' conservative ' prediction by @entity15			2
and the space agency claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years , with a high chance it will be outside our solar system			0
during a public talk in july in @entity60 , the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes			0
' do we believe there is life beyond @entity42 ? ' said former astronaut and @entity15 administrator @entity69 during a talk earlier this month in @entity60			2
' i would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone			0
' the latter would be the most difficult of the three but , if found , would be a pretty clear indicator that a distant world has plant life			1
to find it they propose that a future telescope could have a capability to detect the unique reflection of light from chlorophyll			2
however they write : ' photosynthetic extraterrestrial life may use a different family of pigment molecules than their terrestrial [ counterparts ] , and the understanding that any claimed detection would be extremely controversial			0
' they add that while detecting chlorophyll would be an indicator - if not definitive proof of life - we should also first look for oxygen and water			1
' water is a very common molecule , and i think a mission to take spectra of exoplanets should certainly look for water , ' said dr @entity33 , the lead study author , reports @entity114 ' indeed , we have found water in a few gas giants more massive than @entity117 orbiting other stars			0
' once these have been found , however , they say that chlorophyll should be searched for on the most promisingly habitable world			0
in addition it would only be detectable when an exoplanet had a lot of vegetation and cloud cover			0
one telescope that could be used to do this would be @entity15 's proposed @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
' the goal of a future space telescope will be primarily to detect water and oxygen on a planet around a nearby star , ' dr @entity33 said			2
' the construction and launch of such a telescope will probably cost at least $ 10 billion [ Â£ 6.2 billion ] and wo n't happen for at least 20 years - a lot of technology development needs to happen first - but it could be the most exciting mission of my lifetime			0
' last week astronomers detected water vapour in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years from @entity42			0
the planet , hat - p - 11 b ( illustrated ) , is about the size of @entity150 and is the smallest outside the solar system known to contain @entity153 molecules this artist 's rendition shows a possible design of a potential successor to the @entity158			0
@entity15 is now investigating the viability of this conceptual mission , called the @entity161 ( @entity32 ) , which looks quite similar to 2018 's @entity162 ( @entity162 )			1

@entity18 scientists suggest looking for chlorophyll on exoplanets
they say if found this would be a strong indicator a planet has vegetation
this in turn would suggest it has plant life - and maybe animals as well
in a paper they suggest we should first look for water and oxygen on potentially habitable exoplanets
but the next step should be chlorophyll to *confirm* a planet 's *habitability*
this could be performed by a future @entity15 telescope called @entity32
