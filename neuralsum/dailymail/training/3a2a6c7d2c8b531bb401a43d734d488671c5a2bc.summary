on the list were lord @entity25 and @entity26 , secretive tycoon @entity27 - once branded a ' shady financier ' - and billionaire @entity30 businessman @entity29			1
scroll down to hear @entity2 's reaction close relationship : @entity9 treasurer @entity34 , left , boasted that he could give donors private access to @entity2 , right today mr @entity2 - who sometimes cooks at the dinner parties - pledged to publish a quarterly register of any future meals at official residences with people who have given more than £ 50,000 to the @entity12			1

billionaire city boss @entity29 went for dinner at @entity90 in february ' this scandal speaks to the conduct and character of this prime minister and his government , ' said mr @entity80			2

' mr @entity80 accused the @entity23 of showing ' utter contempt ' for the @entity117 by failing to attend the @entity118 to address mps about the affair , instead sending cabinet office minister @entity121			2
