by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail the @entity1 have been rocked by a second failed drugs test ahead of the start of the athletics on saturday			1
@entity6 400 metres hurdles champion and @entity8 co-captain @entity7 , son of @entity8 and @entity10 rugby legend @entity9 , was kicked out of the @entity1 after failing a drugs test at the @entity13 @entity12 on july 11			1
it is the second shock for the @entity8 team after 800m runner @entity16 also lost his place last week after testing positive for a banned substance			1
shock : @entity8 co-captain @entity7 has been suspended from the @entity1 for a failed drugs test like @entity16 , @entity9 insisted he had ‘ not knowingly taken any banned substance ’ and has requested a full hearing before the @entity23 , though this is not likely to take place until september			1
in the meantime , both athletes will be banned from track and field			2
@entity9 , 30 , said : ‘ i am utterly devastated about the news of this anti-doping rule violation , which has come as a great shock to me			1
from the outset , i would strongly like to state that i have not knowingly taken any banned substance			1
‘ to be named co-team captain for the @entity37 was a great honour and i am distraught that i wo n’t be able to fulfil this role and join them as part of @entity8			2
‘ as a professional athlete , i have always supported and have been an advocate of clean sport			0
however , i recognise that the responsibility for this situation lies with me and i ’m committed to working with @entity47 and will fully co-operate in the legal process			0
’ enter the dragons : @entity7 poses with his father , the legendary @entity8 rugby player @entity9 ( @entity51 ) @entity9 ’ statement was remarkably similar to the one released on @entity16 ’s behalf last week			1
the pair share the same management company and also sometimes use the same range of supplements , provided by a company called @entity58			0
it is understood @entity9 began using four supplements — which come in sachet form and are then mixed with milk or water — at the start of 2014 , with @entity16 following suit a month later			1
one of the products common to both is called @entity68 , a chocolate - tasting drink high in protein			0
no @entity58 supplements are , however , listed on the @entity73 website , either in the list of registered or batch - tested products			0
athletes are urged to cross-check this website for accredited supplements that should be safe and legal for them to use , though the site does not offer a 100 per cent guarantee			0
a spokesman for @entity58 confirmed yesterday that ‘ an internal and external investigation is going on to find out what has happened ’			0
the 400m hurdler has requested a hearing after insisting he never knowingly took a banned substance the company are expecting test results back early next week but are confident no substances deemed illegal under the @entity91 code will be found in their products			1
@entity37 officials admitted ‘ obvious concern ’ that its previously unblemished anti-doping record has been breached for the second time in nine days and announced it had launched an ‘ internal review ’			0
@entity99 , chief executive of @entity37 , said @entity9 ’ ‘ b ’ sample was tested on thursday and matched the ‘ a ’ sample			2
as in @entity16 ’s case , the exact nature of the banned substance involved has yet to be disclosed , but @entity99 said the two failed tests were ‘ not a coincidence ’			1
he added : ‘ there are common factors in the two situations			0
the fact there have been two cases in a short space of time mean it ’s not a coincidence			0
but at this stage we just hope we can back up what the athletes suspect is the source of the contamination			0
’ double trouble : @entity7 was the second @entity121 to be thrown out of the @entity1 after @entity16 all home nation athletes due to compete at the @entity1 have had to take part in an anti-doping education programme , which specifically stresses the importance of double - checking the legality of supplements using the @entity73 website			1
@entity9 , who won a bronze medal four years ago in @entity130 , had been due to compete in the 400m hurdles alongside former training partner and defending @entity1 champion , @entity133 , a staunch and often outspoken anti-doping advocate			1
the pair were once both part of a well - renowned training group working under @entity138 , who coached @entity139 to the 1993 world 110m hurdles title and a world record			2
@entity9 , however , left in 2010 to work with @entity143 and , currently , @entity144			2
the @entity37 have already been hit by the withdrawal of cyclist @entity146 and triathletes @entity147 and @entity149 through injury , all of whom would have been tipped to win medals			0
missed : @entity7 won gold at the 2012 @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 boxer @entity158 was refused accreditation , ostensibly owing to his conviction for assault in april , and now two members of the athletics team have failed drugs tests			1
@entity9 ’ ban is also a further blow to the credibility of the athletics competition , usually one of the marquee sports at the @entity1			2
with fans already disappointed by the timing of @entity175 ’s decision to pull out , and @entity176 opting only to run in the 4x100m relay next weekend , the sport has now been plunged into another drugs storm			0
the issue has already marred much of the early season , with high profile sprinters @entity181 and @entity183 returning to the sport after serving drugs bans to face @entity185			0
@entity186 is the fastest man in the world this year , yet served a four - year ban following his second anti-doping offence in 2006			0
1984 : born february 27 in @entity190 , @entity8			2
his father is former @entity8 rugby union international @entity9			1
2005 : takes 400 metres hurdles gold at the @entity195			2
2006 : finishes fourth on his @entity1 debut , as well as taking bronze at the @entity199			0
finishes fourth in the @entity201 400m hurdles			1
2008 : misses the @entity202 after sustaining a stress fracture in his right foot			0
2010 : takes silver at the @entity199 and wins bronze for @entity8 at the @entity1 in @entity130			2
2012 : completes a full set of @entity6 medals with 400m hurdles gold in @entity156 just a few weeks before the @entity212 , only to fail to qualify from his @entity214 semi-final			1
2014 : july 25 - @entity9 is suspended after failing a drugs test , @entity37 announces , ruling him out of the @entity1 in @entity13			1
@entity1 off to thrilling start			0

400m hurdles champion @entity7 has been thrown out of @entity220 for failing a drug test
@entity8 co-captain failed the test at the @entity13 @entity12 on july 11
@entity9 insists he ' did not knowingly take a banned substance ' and has requested a hearing before the @entity228
