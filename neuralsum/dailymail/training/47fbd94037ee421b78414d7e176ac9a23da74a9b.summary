@entity2 's @entity1 side appeared in good spirits as they trained ahead of their clash with @entity5			1
the match , which will be played at @entity8 's stadium in north - west @entity5 , will see the current world champions taking on their predecessors			1
neither , though , are in particularly good form			2

@entity18 trains ahead of @entity1 's clash with former world champions @entity5 in @entity21 @entity2 's side have won only two of their last three games , and have lost to @entity25 and @entity26 @entity2 's side have struggled to hit their @entity29 heights , especially after losing captain @entity30 tuesday 's meeting may only be a friendly but @entity32 and @entity33 will view the match as a good test of their teams , both of whom are going through transitional phases following very different @entity29 performances			1
while @entity5 's group - stage exit necessitated the reshuffle of a previously unbeatable formula , @entity1 's success led to the retirement of a number of influential players , including captain @entity30 and @entity50 's @entity49			1
meanwhile , @entity33 even revealed he would be prepared to drop @entity52 duo @entity51 and @entity53 as he continues to look for the right balance			0
he said : ' as i have said , when a player who comes to us plays well , others that want to get into the team will find it more difficult			0
' if i say that @entity51 and @entity53 may find it hard to play i 'm not threatening any sort of revenge or reprisal against anybody , it merely reflects a truth about football that we all know			0
if someone does n't play and his replacement does well , the other player has to do better to get into the team			0
but nobody is ruled out			0
