oxbridge has been branded ‘ institutionally racist ’ and a ‘ finishing school for the private school system ’ by a @entity18 ( pictured ) academic the professor of education at @entity18 called for further measures to ensure more students from disadvantaged backgrounds were admitted			1
in a report by the race relations think tank the @entity27 , professor @entity7 said working class students at @entity18 saw the university as a ‘ a white , middle class bubble ’			1
she said her research suggested that ‘ positive discrimination ’ was at work in @entity34 , bestowing advantage on the already advantaged			2
figures released last year showed @entity38 has the lowest proportion of state school pupil entrants – 57.4 per cent – of any university in @entity42 , once small and specialist higher education institutions are excluded			0
at @entity18 , 63 per cent of undergraduates admitted were from state schools			1
in the @entity27 report , aiming higher : race , @entity50 and @entity51 , professor @entity7 suggested varying success rates of different applicant groups demonstrated ‘ institutional racism ’			1
policies such as rarely accepting candidates with less traditional qualifications , not catering for part - time students and not allowing undergraduates to work during term time effectively rule out the majority of working class and particularly black and ethnic minority candidates , she said			1
in 2013 , 25.4 per cent of white students applying to @entity38 won a place			0
the success rate of @entity66 and @entity68 students was under seven per cent , while black @entity70 students had a 14.3 per cent conversion rate and @entity73 students a 13 per cent success rate			0
the devastating criticism was delivered by professor @entity7 , who accused the universities of ‘ accentuating elitism ’ among the privileged ( file picture of @entity38 ) at @entity18 , black @entity70 applicants had a 24.3 per cent chance of success compared to 29 per cent for @entity83 applicants			1
the figure for black @entity73 students was 9.2 per cent , and @entity66 and @entity68 students 13.8 and 13.6 per cent respectively			0
she said : ‘ @entity34 remains the equivalent of a finishing school for the private school system , polishing , refining and accentuating the elitism and sense of superiority acquired in earlier schooling			1
’ the academic suggested that affirmative action , such as quotas for certain groups , were needed to counteract ‘ the growing class and race inequalities that are pervasive across the higher education sector ’			0
both universities said they ‘ strongly rejected ’ the professor ’s allegations and outlined the millions of pounds they spend on encouraging students from poor and ethnic backgrounds to apply and on supporting them once they were there			2
a @entity18 spokesman said extensive efforts were made to encourage more applications from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and that such students represented 16 per cent of the intake , which is in line with national population trends			2
‘ success rates are influenced by prior school attainment , our entry requirements and the combinations of subjects studied by applicants , ’ he said			0
‘ data shows that ethnic minority admissions to @entity18 reflect national trends once prior school attainment has been factored in			2
choices relating to subject of study and location of university also have a substantial bearing on entry rates by ethnic group			0
our commitment to improving access to the @entity18 is longstanding and unwavering			2
’ a spokesman for @entity38 said : ‘ we reject in the strongest terms any allegations of institutional bias or discrimination			0
such claims are unsubstantiated , and we are concerned that unfounded allegations could undermine our efforts to attract and admit black and minority ethnic students			0
just under a quarter of all @entity38 students of known ethnicity are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds			0
