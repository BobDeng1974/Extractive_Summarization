hundreds of online gamers saw months of work building gigantic warships in a massive community sci - fi game go up in smoke - all thanks to the rather earthly reason of an unpaid bill			1
the virtual payment was supposed to ensure that an area of the galaxy in @entity10 was fortified , but the lapse allowed one side to launch a surprise attack			1
some were asleep when it happened and woke up to text alerts telling them the bad news			0
@entity10 uses an in - game currency that can be calculated in real - world cash , and the damage from monday 's conflict would have cost $ 300,000 in the real world			1
during the encounter more than 100 @entity38 vessels were destroyed			0
the megaships , which are akin to the @entity41 from @entity42 , are the largest ships in the game and are worth about $ 3,000 each in real - world money			2
players from one side saw months of work building warships go up in smoke because an unpaid online bill enable their enemies to launch a surprise attack monday 's @entity10 battle was so huge that it actually put the game 's servers under strain the @entity38 also take months for gamers to build - that 's months in real time , a lot of nights , weekends and days - off actually spent building			1
the battle was so complex that at the time of writing , the full results still had n't been calculated			0
monday ’s skirmish first erupted after a member of gamer @entity70 ’s coalition missed a payment to protect an area that 's been used as a staging ground for a war raging between @entity77 and @entity78 coalition versus @entity79 and @entity81 forces			1
the 29 - year - old from @entity83 , @entity84 , said : ‘ supposedly , it was set up for auto - pay , just like any other bill in real life , but either that did n't happen or the money was n't in the wallet , and then everything just escalated out of control from there			0
‘ the dust is still settling on that issue			0
everyone is just focused right now on fighting to try to regain control of the system			0
’ @entity70 was awakened by a messaging app on his phone used by alliance members alerting him that their system @entity103 was under attack by rivals			0
he was n't scheduled to work in real life monday , so he spent the entire day sending virtual ships into the fray			1
he said dozens of his alliance members took the day off work to join the fight , which is being waged by more than 4,000 players - and spectated by thousands more on the game streaming service @entity112			1
monday ’s battle was so huge that it actually put the game ’s servers under strain			1
‘ i 'd be lying if i said our servers were n't sweating a bit , ’ said ‘ @entity10 ’ spokesman @entity118 of @entity119 , the @entity120 , @entity122 - based video game developer who created the online universe			1
‘ allowing players free movement wherever they want in a game with over half a million players means for some pretty tricky technological requirements			2
’ to compensate for thousands of starship captains battling each other online , @entity118 said @entity119 instituted what it calls ‘ time dilation , ’ which slows down the game 's servers to about 10 percent of normal time , so players are n't dropped and their commands are issued in the order in which they were received			1
@entity70 said it 's made for a massive but slow battle			0
the real - world value of ‘ @entity10 ’ currency is based on an actual exchange rate set up for the game			2
but the primary basis for value in the game 's virtual economy is the time and skill that gamers put into such concepts as the mining of minerals , the selling of goods and services , or the stealing of goods and money ( just do n't get caught )			2
however , if players want a shortcut , they can put real - world money into the game to buy ‘ @entity10 ’ currency determined by the exchange rate , but the money can only be exchanged from real to virtual			1
meanwhile , @entity70 is optimistic his coalition will recover from the latest ‘ @entity10 ’ upheaval			2
‘ it looks like @entity79 is winning , but we 're hoping now that all of our @entity176 players are online , we 'll turn the tide , ’ said @entity70			0
‘ whatever happens , we 'll keep going			0
` @entity10 ' is a universe full of grudges and constantly changing politics			2
if we were to lose , we 'll rebuild			0
then , we 'll go back and start another war			0
