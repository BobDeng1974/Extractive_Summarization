@entity0 did all he could to allow the @entity2 derby to develop into a good physical battle and keep 22 players on the park			0
@entity8 perhaps benefited most from @entity0 ’s approach with a series of fouls , any number of which could have been cautioned but only one was			0
in such a game when so much happens the referee will always miss some incidents and both teams should have had penalty kicks			1
@entity8 was booked in the second minute after a reckless challenge on @entity20 's @entity19 @entity20 boss @entity21 questioned @entity0 's decision to not send off @entity8 @entity20 left back @entity24 appeals to @entity0 after @entity8 handled the ball inside the area @entity8 raised his hand to block a shot from @entity20 's @entity29 in the ninth minute @entity30 first when @entity24 pulled @entity31 to the ground and @entity20 following a clear hand ball from @entity8			1
@entity0 was completely blameless in missing the first as he was unsighted and could have been helped by his assistant but had a good view himself of the @entity8 handball but somehow decided it was accidental			2
overall i thought @entity0 ’s approach helped the game and made it a more enjoyable spectacle			0
the fact that the missed penalties balanced each other out meant he had no adverse effect on the result			0
@entity8 was booked by the @entity50 official inside the first two minutes for a late foul on @entity19 @entity20 's @entity19 went flying after a reckless challenge by his fellow countryman the @entity20 playmaker looked in some pain after the challenge but was able to carry on playing			1

@entity0 booked @entity8 inside the first two minutes but decided against giving the @entity30 man a second *yellow*
@entity8 made a reckless challenge on @entity62 before handling a shot from @entity29
both teams should have been *awarded* penalty kicks by @entity0
