there 's nothing more embarrassing than waking up at someone else 's place and having to step out in yesterday 's outfit			0
but now there 's a perfect solution to those morning after woes - a top that can be worn 24 different ways in a variety of colours , without the use of any zips , ties or buttons			1
the @entity17 shirt is the brainchild of @entity20 - based designer @entity19 , who came up with the idea as a way of bringing a playful element to her wardrobe and getting more use out of key pieces			1
' i was making a shirt as a gift for my best friend 's birthday , and i had this vague idea for a multi-layer top with a black front and white back , ' she said			2
' but only when i actually held it in my hands , i discovered i could flip it and get a totally black shirt , and then flip it again and get an all - white shirt			0
i realised then how many different options this structure offered , ' she explained			0
a mesmerizing video on the project 's @entity53 page , which has raised a whopping $ 35,600 so far , shows just how the shirt works with the clever use of double - layer construction			1
no more outfit repeats : the shirt , which comes in red , blue or green and costs $ 80 ( about £ 52 ) , is billed as the perfect solution to a morning after situation the model in the video begins by wearing the top in plain black with a deep v - neck with grey panels on the sleeves			1
then she pulls it off inside - out and puts it back on , and this time it has black and white stripes in the front and plain black sleeves			0
when she rolls up the sleeves , they miraculously become a bright shade of blue			0
later , she turns the top inside - out yet again and it becomes grey with a neckline in black and monochrome stripes on the back			2
all in all , the top can be worn up to 24 different ways , providing almost an entire month of styles using just one piece of clothing			2
' i believe that fashion is all about change , inviting us to re-invent ourselves , ' said @entity19			2
' i hope to get the attention of women who enjoy being unexpected and ever - changing			0
