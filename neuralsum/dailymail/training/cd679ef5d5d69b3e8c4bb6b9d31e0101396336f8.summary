by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 05:06 est , 28 may 2013 ' indefensible ' : speaker @entity1 and his wife @entity2 , who have three young children , have previously said their nanny was ' live - in ' the commons speaker is facing a storm of criticism after it emerged his children 's nanny lives in a taxpayer - funded apartment in the @entity12			1
@entity1 - who earns over £ 140,000 per year and has backed calls for pay rises for @entity15 - and his wife @entity2 have given their nanny the run of the housekeeper ’s apartment near their own palatial rooms inside the @entity12			1
the nanny ’s accommodation in the @entity25 is entirely covered by the public purse , including the council tax and utility bills			1
the arrangement has been described as ' indefensible ' by a former chairman of the @entity31			2
the @entity32 , who have three young children , have separately acquired a riverside property nearby for £ 935,000 just four miles away			2
previously the couple said that their nanny was ‘ live - in ’			1
but according to details released after a freedom of information request , it now transpires that she lives in a separate flat consisting of one bedroom , kitchen , bathroom and a living room			0
renting such a property in the prime @entity47 near @entity12 could cost at least £ 2,000 a month , or closer to £ 4,000 for the most well - appointed property			1
taxpayers are picking up the bill for the @entity52 property , which @entity53 charges £ 1,141 a year for			2
late last year , the couple bought another @entity56 - side apartment in an exclusive , gated development in @entity58 , four miles south - west of the @entity12			2
the apartment is 3,100 square foot with plenty of room for a growing family and domestic staff			0
a spokesman for the @entity25 said : ‘ @entity66 has for many years provided accommodation for previous speakers ’ personal staff			0
' the current speaker has a young family and therefore requires full - time childcare support ( paid for by him ) , so the @entity74 ’s accommodation is provided for a nanny			1
the flat consists of one bedroom , a kitchen , a bathroom and a living room			0
there is no separate utility supply to the flat			0
he added : ‘ accommodation on the @entity25 estate is provided as officeholders , and therefore those who support them , are required to be available on the parliamentary estate over prolonged periods and at unpredictable times			0
’ asked whether the @entity32 pay tax on the perks , the spokesman replied that the @entity25 did not have the information			0
the speaker ’s wife , @entity2 , first revealed the family ’s childcare arrangements on @entity99 two years ago , saying : ‘ does @entity1 ’s nanny live rent - free at his grace - and - favour house ? yes			1
’ she later said : ‘ we have a ‘ live - in ’ nanny			1
so does n’t pay rent			0
’ prime postcode : a comparable property with an @entity112 postcode could cost up to £ 4,000 per month in rent the nanny lived in the flat with her husband			1
it is not clear if the @entity32 still employ the same nanny			0
@entity119 , chief executive of the @entity121 ’ @entity118 , said : ‘ anyone in the outside world taking on a live - in nanny has to cover the cost of their accommodation and bills , so why should the speaker be any different ? he is extremely well paid and already enjoys a number of taxpayer - funded perks			1
‘ the full details of all perks and benefits - in - kind enjoyed by him , his family and staff should be a matter of public record , so that they can be properly scrutinised			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s salary as speaker is £ 141,504 a year			1
nannies who live in are usually paid less than those who have to live outside the home and fund their own rent , meaning that taxpayers could be subsidising the wages for the @entity32 ’ domestic staff			2
sir @entity148 , the former chairman of the committee on @entity31 , which scrutinises politicians ’ behaviour , said the arrangement was ‘ indefensible ’			2
he told the @entity153 : ‘ i am surprised that in this current climate he can not cover the costs from his generous salary			0
' it is indefensible really that thousands if not millions of people who have childcare costs themselves have to fund the privilege of a flat and all the expenses with that			0

@entity1 and @entity165 have previously said their nanny was ' live - in '
*similar* property in @entity47 could cost up to £ 4,000 per month
accommodation , council tax and utility bills all paid for by taxpayer
mr @entity1 earns a salary of £ 141,504 per year as @entity178
