mr @entity10 said : ' there 's a big slab of titanium in my head now and i 've got the nickname ' space shuttle head ' from my mates			1
' the first thing i thought when i got it was that when i go through metal detectors at the airport it 's going to go off			1
' there has been lots of positives since having the implant			2
i do feel more confident with it			2
' but physically i still have to be really careful with it and it can be painful			2
i ca n't party like i used to			2
consultation : experts at @entity74 in @entity75 then used the bone to mould the plate in place ' when i think about the accident i still get emotional			0
i think about my parents and family and what they had to go through			0
' the worst part of the whole ordeal was realising emotionally that i died and they brought me back to life			1
' now i am just thinking about moving on with my life and moving into a new place			0
the whole thing has given me perspective			0

size : the plate is around six inches long and is made from the same material used to construct giant passenger jet but luckily the 32 - year - old was strong enough to be transferred back to @entity2 on january 18			1
he brought the fragment back to the @entity2 in a sterile box in hand luggage which was guarded by his doctor			0
experts at @entity74 in @entity75 then used the bone to mould a new titanium plate to be fitted in his head			1
the plate is around six inches long and is made from the same material used to construct giant passenger jets and even space ships			1
during the four hour operation , surgeons had to cut open his head and use three screws to fit the titanium plate over the gap in his skull during the four hour op surgeons had to cut open his head and use three screws to fit the titanium plate over the gap in his skull			1
the procedure would normally use four screws but @entity6 surgeons cut his skull too far back and there was n't space to fit the final screw			1

' @entity173 , clinical nurse specialist for @entity175 , said surgeons even used 3d imaging equipment to make sure the mould was a perfect fit			0
she said : ' the plate is made of titanium and is manufactured at the hospital by the @entity183			0
' they use the part of the patient 's bone that has been removed and use it to create a mould			2
' the titanium is then hand - tempered and moulded into exactly the right shape to fit the patient 's head			2
' modern techniques mean specialists can also use 3d imaging equipment to make sure the fit is 100 per cent accurate			0
' techniques are now changing and specialists are also looking at using different types of materials			0
' on average , a plate like this would take several days to make and would cost around Â£ 900 to produce			2
