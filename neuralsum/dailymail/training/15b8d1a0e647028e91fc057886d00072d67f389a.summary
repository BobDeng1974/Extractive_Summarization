@entity2 , who married the @entity12 and @entity13 , said marriage was now being marketed to people as a day long experience , rather than a lifetime commitment			1
speaking at a debate hosted by law firm @entity19 in @entity20 , lord @entity2 also criticised pre-nuptual agreements for undermining the trust at the heart of marriage			2
according to @entity25 , he said : ' we need to take a long hard look at the marketisation of marriage			0
' that is the perfect relationship crystalised in the perfect wedding day - the immense economic , advertising investment in this massively fantastical experience which you go through on your wedding day , after which , of course , nothing is ever quite so good again			0
' that is an aspect i think of the short - term , unimaginative , emotionally unintelligent climate that sometimes we seem forced to inhabit			1
' lord @entity2 , who stepped down as archbishop last year and became master of @entity45 at the @entity46 , said that the modern urge for short - term gratification was also to blame			1

his warning echoes that of @entity88 , the work and pensions secretary , who said in december that a fixation with ' glitzy , celebrity ' weddings fuelled by glossy magazines is overshadowing the true meaning of marriage			0
at the time he warned that the obsession with expensive nuptials was discouraging many youngsters from tying the knot and starting families and saddling those that do with debts from the ceremony that add strain to their relationships .			0
