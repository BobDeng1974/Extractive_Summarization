the @entity0 claims hunching over a screen can damage posture and cause back or neck pain watching movies in bed on your laptop or tablet is playing havoc with the nation 's backs , a new study warned			1
nearly half of all @entity14 confessed they used the devices before dropping off to sleep			2

three fifths also watch tv in bed and four fifths of those spend up to four hours glued to the screen			0
but the @entity0 warned much of this tv time is at uncomfortable body angles			0
instead it is urging @entity14 to make bedrooms tech free zones to improve sleep quality and better posture			1
@entity0 chiropractor , @entity35 , said : ' technology has become integral to our lives but when it comes to bedtime it is having negative repercussions on our lifestyles and bodies			0
' our research shows that nearly half ( 48 % ) of people ca n't sleep due to back or neck pain but technology could actually be exacerbating the problem			1
' many of my patients who ca n't sleep will resort to a laptop or a mobile phone to help them get to sleep , for example to watch a film , but the reality is this could further prevent them from sleeping			2
' the light given off by screens stimulates the brain making us feel more awake and what 's more , when people use technology in bed , they often do n't pay attention to their postures which can cause pain and keep them awake			0
' we 're urging people to make their bedrooms tech - free zones and see what benefits can come from this			1
' it said laptops , tablets and smartphones should be banished from the bedrooms			0
if tempted to check emails one last time before bed , people should try doing this in the living room or the kitchen then switch off before retiring to bed			0
and instead of relying on mobiles for an alarm call , people should invest in a traditional old fashioned alarm clock as this will remove both the temptation to use it and stop its lights disrupting sleep			0
but if you have to use devices in bed , make sure your back is supported with a pillow and the device is propped up so it 's at eye level			2
