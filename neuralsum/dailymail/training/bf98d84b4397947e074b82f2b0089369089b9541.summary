by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 12:16 est , 11 october 2012 a pc who made a false police report that his @entity4 had been stolen was caught after he used it to call his girlfriend			2
@entity1 @entity6 , 35 , wanted a new @entity4 so pretended his had been snatched in a @entity7 and created a bogus crime report to back up his fictitious claims			1
but the bungling policeman , who worked for the @entity11 , was rumbled when the phone was used to call his girlfriend and home number after he reported it stolen in april 2010			0
@entity6 was found guilty of reporting his mobile stolen to claim for a new one on his insurance @entity6 denied fraud but was convicted following a trial at @entity20			1
he was spared jail today after @entity22 , defending , urged a judge to give him a suspended sentence and said @entity6 had repaid @entity25 the £ 489 he conned them out of			1
judge @entity26 told him what he had done was ‘ deplorable ’ and ‘ deeply antisocial			0
’ he added it ‘ greatly undermined ’ the confidence and trust the public placed in the police force			0
but he said a six - month jail term fitted the crime and was satisfied he could suspend this for two years as it was @entity6 ’s first offence			1
@entity6 will also be tagged , be the subject of a curfew between 8pm and 7am and pay court costs of £ 1,000			1
the judge warned him : ' if you commit any further crime while this sentence is suspended you will be brought back before me and i will sent you straight to prison			2
no mitigation will save you			0
' asked if he understood @entity6 answered : ' yes , your honour			2
' the officer lied because he wanted a new @entity50 iphone sentencing him , judge @entity26 said : ' your motive for this offence , which in my judgment can only be pre-meditated , was to secure a new phone worth between £ 400 and £ 500 through the medium of the company which insurance the allegedly stolen telephone			2
' this was an insurance fraud , albeit towards the lower end of the spectrum			0
' there is , however , an added dimension to this as you were at the time a serving police officer and you used your position to further this fraud			0
' the judge said when @entity6 was found out he lied repeatedly to cover his tracks			2
he added : ' you contended this was merely a product of such things as panic , confusion and foolishness			0
' in my judgment it was neither			0
this was obviously the product of a criminal who in fear of being discovered attempted to lie as a way out of his predicament without success			0
' the court heard @entity6 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , had been a promising police officer who had received recommendations in his early years			1
but after his lip was bitten off during a domestic incident he attended he suffered post-traumatic stress , was put on anti-depressants and he was consigned to a desk job			1
shortly before he committed this crime he had been disciplined by the police for poor timekeeping			0
@entity6 has been facing an internal disciplinary hearing before he quit the force			1
he now plans to work as a builder .			1

@entity1 @entity6 has quit the @entity105 and now plans to work as a builder
officer created a bogus crime report
had been a promising officer before his lip was bitten off in a domestic incident he attended
