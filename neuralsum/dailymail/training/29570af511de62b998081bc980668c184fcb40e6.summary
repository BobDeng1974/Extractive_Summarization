a £ 900billion bailout for the crisis - torn eurozone was unveiled yesterday in a last - ditch bid to kick - start growth			1
the @entity5 outlined a massive money - printing programme known as quantitative easing as it stepped up the fight against deflation and stagnation			1
the central bank will create nearly £ 46billion of extra cash every month between march this year and september next year – a total of almost £ 900billion			1
the @entity5 outlined a massive money - printing programme known as quantitative easing as it stepped up the fight against deflation and stagnation the landmark decision – which will see the @entity5 buy government and corporate bonds across the 19 countries of the single currency bloc – is intended to cut borrowing costs and boost lending to families and businesses			1
the prospect of billions of euros flooding into the system sent the euro tumbling on the foreign exchange markets – a move the @entity5 hopes will boost exports by making goods produced in the eurozone cheaper for foreign buyers			1
@entity36 quickly hit a seven - year high against the euro , with £ 1 buying 1.32 euros			1
this makes @entity40 holidays cheaper for @entity42 tourists , but it also makes @entity42 exports to @entity40 more expensive , so less competitive			1
the health of the eurozone is crucial to @entity42 because it is the @entity42 ’s largest trading partner and can have a huge impact on confidence on this side of the @entity51			2
@entity52 ( pictured ) said it was ‘ welcome action ’ from the @entity5 ‘ but not sufficient for a @entity40 recovery ’ speaking at the @entity56 in the @entity58 ski resort of @entity59 , @entity52 said it was ‘ welcome action ’ from the @entity5 ‘ but not sufficient for a @entity40 recovery ’			1
calling on @entity40 governments to grasp the nettle , the chancellor added : ‘ we want to see this accompanied by clear plans to make the @entity40 continent more competitive , to back business in @entity40 , to create jobs and to make sure public finances are in order			0
‘ now we have all those ingredients in the @entity42 and that is why our economic plan is delivering a strong economic recovery			0
' we want to see all those ingredients in place on the @entity40 continent so that the whole of @entity40 recovers			0
‘ the fact that the @entity5 had to take this drastic action shows the @entity40 economy is much weaker than the @entity42 economy and it ’s also a warning to @entity42 of the risks that lie ahead if we were to abandon our long term economic plan			1
’ @entity5 president @entity86 ( pictured ) described the @entity88 programme as ‘ very large ’ and said it will continue until inflation returns towards the target of close to but under 2 per cent unemployment is already stubbornly high at 11.5 per cent in the single currency bloc compared with 5.8 per cent in the @entity42			1
around a quarter of @entity95 and @entity96 who want work can not find a job including half of those under the age of 25			0
this crisis has sparked fears of a ‘ lost generation ’ in the eurozone and experts believe it risks a rise in extremist parties – such as the radical left - wing , anti-austerity @entity111 party , which is leading the polls ahead of elections in @entity95 on sunday			2
@entity115 leaders hope that by kick - starting growth the @entity88 programme will prevent a repeat of the riots that have been seen in @entity95 , @entity96 and elsewhere against austerity measures , which were introduced to try to tackle the debt crisis @entity121 has long opposed @entity88 in the eurozone amid concerns in @entity124 that it amounts to bailout for spendthrift countries and could encourage governments to renege on economic reforms			1
what is quantitative easing ? @entity88 is the method used by central banks to stimulate growth in an ailing economy when all else – including slashing interest rates – fails			1
it involves the creation of new money to be injected into ailing economies to stimulate growth			0
it is sometimes called printing money but no hard cash is actually printed			2
how does it work ? the central bank uses its newly - created ‘ money ’ to buy bonds from banks and other institutions , increasing the amount of cash in the financial system			1
in theory this inflow of money encourages cash - rich banks to lend more to business and individuals , enabling companies to expand and people to spend more			2
this should generate more jobs			0
who ’s done it before ? the @entity164 launched a £ 375billion @entity88 programme in march 2009 during the depths of the financial crisis and the @entity168 has bought bonds worth $ 3.7 trillion ( £ 2.4 trillion ) since starting @entity88 in 2008			2
flashpoint : police are attacked in @entity95 during anti-austerity protests in 2012 both have now wound down the programme because their economies have improved			0
has it worked ? it depends who you ask			0
the @entity164 estimates that its @entity88 programme helped increase the @entity42 ’s annual economic output by between 1.5pc and 2pc			0
homeowners have benefited , as mortgage rates have fallen to record lows			0
but @entity88 has been a disaster for millions of pensioners because it has pushed down savings and annuity rates , which determine their annual retirement income			0
banks have also hoarded much of the money they have received instead of lending it			0
what about the eurozone ? the @entity5 ’s new @entity88 plan – which will pour around £ 900billion into the eurozone ’s banking system over 20 months – is intended to prevent deflation and address appalling levels of unemployment and economic growth			1
deflation – or negative inflation – is when prices fall year on year			2
this usually leads to a fall in incomes and thus tax revenues			0
deflation also means debt becomes more expensive to service and people are reluctant to spend money , believing prices will fall further			2
will it work in @entity40 ? it should help , but some experts fear its impact may be limited when the £ 900billion is spread across 19 countries			0
the cash might also cause troubled economies such as @entity224 and @entity95 to delay reforming their labour markets and cutting borrowing and debt			0
how does it affect the @entity42 ? the pound is likely to strengthen significantly against the euro			0
this is good for holidaymakers , but bad for exports because @entity42 goods and services will become more expensive abroad			2
in the long run it should help @entity42 if the eurozone – our biggest export market – is shaken out of its torpor			0
@entity115 countries will have to apply to the @entity5 if they want to take advantage of the stimulus package			2
the amount of new money available to each nation is yet to be calculated , but the @entity5 has stipulated that it will not buy bonds equivalent to more than one - third of a country ’s debt			1
@entity5 president @entity86 described the @entity88 programme as ‘ very large ’ and said it will continue until inflation returns towards the target of close to but under 2 per cent – raising the prospect of it lasting beyond september next year			1
‘ we believe that the measures will be effective , will raise medium term inflation expectations and will address the economic situation in the euro area , ’ he said at the @entity5 ’s headquarters in @entity256			1
but @entity42 business leaders warned that mr @entity86 ’s proposals could be ‘ too little too late ’			0
@entity264 , director general of the @entity265 , said : ‘ the @entity5 ’s @entity88 programme is unlikely to solve the fundamental challenges facing the eurozone , which needs sweeping structural changes to return to health			1
