by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 23 september 2012 updated : 06:48 est , 28 september 2012 a teenage boy has been caught using his bedroom as an illegal tattoo parlour to ink his friends , after advertising his services on @entity6			1
up to 15 children - some as young as 13 - paid the @entity10 tattooist their £ 5 pocket money for the ' body art ' while his unsuspecting parents watched television downstairs			1
but the illegal practice was soon discovered after the parents of a 14 - year - old girl complained to @entity18 when she home with a tattoo on her leg			1
kitted out : the 15 - year - old was found with a range of equipment in his bedroom , which he had turned into an illegal tattoo parlour after raiding the schoolboy 's bedroom in @entity29 , @entity30 , officers found a tattooist 's kit under his bed with a stained ' skull and crossbones ' tattoo machine and contaminated needles			1
they also recovered a blender for the inks , rubber gloves and tracing paper for designs including hearts , butterflies and swallows			0
it is believed the 15 - year - old boy had attempted to sterilise the needles using household @entity49 , hand gel and @entity53 cream			1
the boy was questioned on suspicion of an offence under the @entity56 of 1969 , but no further action was taken against him after he was given a formal warning and the kit was confiscated			1
the youngsters tattooed by the boy are believed to have been advised to undergo health checks tests			1
pictures of the boy 's extensive tattoo kit emerged as council inspectors said youngsters who had paid for the tattoos were ' taking their life in their hands ' by risking deadly infections , including hepatitis , @entity73 and blood poisoning			1
infection risk : the teenager had tried to disinfect his needles with household products it is illegal in @entity80 to tattoo anyone under the age of 18 except when the tattoo is performed for medical reasons by a duly qualified medical practitioner or by a person working under their direction			1
the maximum sentence for those convicted of tattooing under age youngsters can be a fine of up to a £ 1,000 pounds			0
but tattoos remain popular among children who attempt to copy their celebrity heroes			2
councillor @entity97 at @entity98 , said : ' it 's shocking to think the risks that young people are taking using unregistered tattooists			2
' we work very closely with the parlours in the town to ensure that anyone having a tattoo is doing so in a safe and hygiene environment			2
' i understand that the equipment can be bought from as little as £ 50 on @entity111 , making it more accessible than ever to those wanting to make a quick buck			0
' the last thing we want is young people making a bad decision that could cause permanent damage and impact on their health			0
' the council said over the last two months there had been an increased concerns about underage children being tattooed			2
discovered : this stained skull and crossbones tattoo gun was found under the teenager 's bed officials have fielded reports of children as young as 13 obtaining tattoos , along with concerns over infected equipment , poor quality workmanship and the risk of disease			1
inquiries have revealed that the main source of the problem is from people setting up illegal make shift tattoo studios from home			0
the boy 's bedroom was one of two properties targeted by @entity98 and the police using new powers aimed at safeguarding public safety			0
the law requires any person who operates as a tattooist to be registered with the local authority and comply with a code of conduct focusing on cleanliness , sterilisation of equipment and the overall hygiene and facilities of the premises			0
@entity98 is now beginning an awareness campaign working with @entity29 and the @entity164 and local schools to highlight the dangers			0
@entity167 , vice principal at @entity29 and the @entity164 , said : ' the college is happy to raise awareness among young people about the risks posed by illegal tattooing			0
the teenager had been operating an tattoo parlour illegally from his home in @entity29 , @entity30 ' there are many pressures on young people today and by keeping our students informed while in college , we will hopefully help to make sure that they can stay safe in the outside world			1
' @entity183 from @entity185 's @entity184 , added : ' people getting a cheap tattoo in a makeshift studio do n't know the real cost of what they are doing			0
' picking up an infection in an unhygienic environment could cause serious health problems or at worse , their life			0
' @entity195 , who runs @entity197 tattoo studio , in @entity29 said : ' the biggest risk is cross-contamination with people not cleaning the @entity201 properly			2
it 's a hepatitis lottery			0
' one of the reasons we bought a tattoo removal machine is because of the atrocious standard of work which is being done not just by kids , but by a lot of adults as well from bedrooms and garages			2
' we 've seen a big increase in it over the last 12 to 14 months			0
' @entity216 , a consultant doctor at @entity218 's accident and emergency department said anyone inked in unhygienic conditions was taking a ' big risk '			0
he added : ' sterilising needles in @entity53 is not a chemical , sterile procedure			1
it carries a huge risk , not only of infections such as cellulitis , but also blood - born viruses , most notably hepatitis and @entity73 , which can be transmitted through dirty needles			1
