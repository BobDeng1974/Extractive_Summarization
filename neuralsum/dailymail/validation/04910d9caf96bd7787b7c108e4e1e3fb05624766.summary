after another meek surrender , the widespread belief that @entity1 are far too good to go down may have to be re-examined			1
once again , @entity4 's team were dramatically less than the collection of their parts and the amiable @entity7 seems unable to identify what is rotten in the core of his team			1
goals in each half from @entity14 – a long - range header no less – and @entity16 deservedly gave @entity17 the points as @entity20 ' side rose to eighth in the table , a remarkable 14 points ahead of their beleaguered visitors			1
@entity17 winger @entity14 ( centre ) rises up to head home his side 's opening goal en route to a 2 - 0 victory against @entity1 the on - loan @entity31 forward points to acknowledge supporters after handing his side a first - half lead @entity17 substitute @entity16 sealed the win with late goal after reacting to @entity38 's rebound @entity1 manager @entity4 looks concerned with his side collecting only one win from their last 12 games the statistics for @entity1 are damning			1
just one win in 12 league games , just one league clean sheet away from @entity46 since september			1
@entity47 , their bright young hope , was kept on the bench while those who played laboured			0
poor @entity52 was barracked mercilessly by the @entity17 fans after he snubbed them in january to join @entity1 and was substituted after 60 forgettable minutes			1
@entity55 picked up his 10th booking of the season , and a record 106th of his career , and will miss the next two games against @entity61 and @entity62			0
the speed the 34 - year - old moved about the @entity66 , that might be a blessing for everyone			2
what is perplexing is the individual quality on show for @entity1			2
established internationals like @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and others are the reason they are the sole @entity81 survivors in the @entity82			0
@entity17 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity83 6.5 ; @entity84 6.5 , @entity85 5.5 ( @entity86 17 6 ) , @entity87 6.5 , @entity88 6 ; @entity89 6 , @entity90 6.5 ; @entity91 6 , @entity92 6.5 ( @entity38 ) , @entity14 7 ; @entity93 6 ( @entity16 ) subs : @entity96 ( @entity95 ) , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 booked : @entity83 , @entity91 goal : @entity14 ( 32 ) , @entity16 ( 84 ) @entity1 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity73 6 ; @entity75 5.5 , @entity74 6 ; stones 6 , @entity102 ; @entity103 ( @entity104 60 6 ) , @entity105 6 ; @entity52 5 ( @entity106 60 6 ) , @entity76 6 , @entity107 6.5 ( @entity108 ) ; @entity77 5 subs : @entity110 ( @entity95 ) , @entity111 , @entity47 , @entity112 booked : @entity55 , @entity107 referee : @entity114 attendance : 26,431 @entity116 : @entity14 ( @entity17 ) click here to see all the stats from the game , including @entity14 ' superb header , from our brilliant @entity121 but standing just six points above the bottom three , an almost - inconceivable double – qualification for the @entity125 and relegation to the @entity127 – is still possible			1
' it is a tough and demanding period			0
but there is no such thing as fear , we showed last year we have a really talented squad			0
we have 30 points to fight for and we are going to give our lives to get as many as we can , ' said @entity4			2
' we are all disappointed , the fans , the players , everyone but we are going to recover for the next challenge which we are desperate to face			0
everything that could go wrong did go wrong , that is what happens when you have negative momentum			0
but we are not looking down , we want to get as many points as we can			0
' @entity17 players walk out accompanied by their mascots for the game against @entity148 at the @entity66 @entity17 midfielder @entity92 ( right ) battles with @entity55 , who picked up a record 106th @entity150 booking during the game @entity93 , who has equalled the record for headed goals in the @entity150 at the weekend , attempts to go one better @entity148 loan signing @entity52 was jeered by snubbed @entity17 fans before being hauled off on the hour mark @entity1 fans seemed divided at the end , some booed and some encouraged their fallen idols			1
they will all be glad to see @entity161 back from injury in time to face @entity61 in their next league game on march 15			0
without him , @entity1 's defence looked flimsy			1
after 32 minutes , @entity84 's cross was met with a tremendous leap by @entity14 , who headed over @entity73 from 12 yards			1
why @entity1 's centre - halves @entity74 and @entity169 backed off to give @entity14 a free header was unclear and they immediately held a post-goal inquest			1
' we restricted them to very few opportunites afterwards , ' said @entity17 boss @entity20			2
of those that did come , @entity52 shot straight at @entity83 and @entity77 dragged a shot wide , a feeble finish denoting a lack of confidence			0
substitute @entity106 had the best shot which was well parried by @entity83			0
if anything , @entity17 looked likelier to add a second once @entity16 had replaced @entity93 , and so it proved			1
a quick @entity17 counter-attack saw the ball cannon off @entity187 in @entity16 's path			1
he led the charge with @entity38 and when the @entity190 struck the post , @entity16 followed up to prod in the rebound			1
@entity14 leaves @entity1 players standing as he leaps to meet @entity84 's drilled cross in the first - half @entity73 stretches in vain as @entity14 bullet header passes the @entity1 keeper into the top left corner @entity14 ( right ) looks undersized as he celebrates his strike with some of the @entity17 's typically taller players @entity1 keeper @entity73 looks dejected as he walks to retrieve the ball from the back of his net moses wheels away to celebrate his strike with @entity17 team - mate @entity93 as the @entity66 erupts @entity17 's 2 - 0 victory means @entity1 have already conceded 41 premier @entity209 goals in 28 games			1
they let in just 39 in the whole of last season			0
' we deserved it , @entity14 was excellent , he showed strength to the end , ' said a delighted @entity20			2
@entity17 were everything @entity1 were n't , fully commmited to a gameplan			1
they even recovered from the loss of centre - half @entity85 who limped off early , but it was @entity4 who complained about the bad luck			2
' six of our 10 games left are at @entity46 and that is a powerful tool for us , ' he said in what was effectively a rallying cry for everyone at the club			0
@entity1 finished fifth last season and were predicted to make a tip at the @entity125			2
instead they are relying on clubs like @entity237 and @entity62 being worse than they are			0
' this is a really talented squad but we are in a period where things are going wrong			0
the first time we allowed @entity17 a cross into our box , they score from it from an unlikely source			2
we feel there was a foul on @entity74 in the build - up for the second goal at a time when we were making chances			0
' @entity4 talks a good game			0
now his team have to play one			0
respective @entity17 and @entity1 managers mark @entity20 ( left ) and @entity4 have a difference of opinion during the game @entity1 's leading scorer @entity77 ( left ) gets a shot away but @entity17 keeper @entity83 is equal to the task @entity84 of @entity17 clashes with @entity263 @entity76 ( centre ) and @entity265 ( right ) during the second half the referee has to intervene as @entity84 gets involved in an altercation with @entity1 players near the corner flag @entity1 's travelling supporters look disgruntled as their side fail to meet expectations again @entity38 of @entity17 lets fly with a late shot that beats @entity73 but is denied by the goal post fortunately , @entity16 is there to react to the rebound and seal all three points for the @entity278 with a late strike substitute @entity16 is congratulated by @entity91 ( centre ) and @entity89 as @entity17 complete a 2 - 0 victory			1

@entity1 's *abysmal* recent run continued as they were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity17 at the @entity66
@entity14 opened the scoring for the @entity278 with a superb header from @entity84 's drilled cross
@entity16 sealed all three points after reacting to a rebound when @entity38 's shot hit the post
the result leaves @entity4 's struggling @entity1 with only one win from his last 12 games
