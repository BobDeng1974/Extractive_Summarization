a local @entity1 paper has come under fire for publishing an opinion piece about president @entity4 that carries the headline ' the n --- - r in the @entity7 '			1
incredibly , the @entity8 - a community paper that serves @entity11 's @entity10 - ran the contemptuous term in full			1
the headline was printed on page 15 in the latest edition of the periodical			1
the accompanying piece by @entity17 criticizes is about the so - called ' anti-black racism of far - right voters ' and how ' far - right voters hate @entity4 because he is black ' according to the @entity21			2
however that has not stopped anger erupting over the mere use of the n - word			0
' it ’s disrespectful in any context to refer to the president of the @entity37 as the n - word , ' one local resident , @entity33 may , 31 , told @entity39			0
' if you were quoting something or referring to the historic context of the word being used , i can understand the justification			0
' ' it seems he ’s just using it for shock value			0
' the editor of @entity8 , 86 - year - old @entity51 , attempted to explain the reason for running the word ' the editorial staff continues to object to the use of the word , ' @entity51 wrote to @entity39			1
' ( @entity57 ) in this article , however , @entity56 reminded me that the @entity60 avoids using the word which convinced me that @entity8 should			2
' @entity17 wanted to use the word ' to shock ' us into accepting that ' there are people who believe and use this outrageous word ' , @entity61 added			2
@entity17 's piece looks at the ' irreducible measure of racism ' in the @entity37 and how he believes it has been bolstered by ' @entity37 's increasing tolerance of far - right opinion '			1
as if to offset any offense the headline would attract , as well as showing alot of though had gone into publishing the slur , @entity8 ran a story directly underneath @entity17 's piece by an @entity78 columnist			1
damage control : the newspaper a story directly underneath the controversial piece by @entity78 columnist @entity83 , who wrote about how the word offends him that story was titled ' the headline offends me '			0
the decision to use the headline feels misguided to me , ' @entity83 wrote			0
' i do n’t see how its use benefits anyone , but i do feel all too clearly how it deeply offends me			0
' besides jouralism , @entity17 also writes children 's books and is a jazz musician .			2
