by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 08:03 est , 19 december 2012 @entity3 ’s @entity2 spacecraft , which has been in in orbit around @entity5 for more than eight years , has taken its most stunning view of the planet yet			1
engineers painstakingly positioned the craft on oct. 17 , 2012 , during its 174th orbit around the gas giant , to take the image			2
it was deliberately positioned within @entity5 ’s shadow , a perfect location from which to look in the direction of the @entity17 and take a backlit view of the rings and the dark side of the planet			2
a stunning view of @entity5 , taken while @entity3 's @entity2 spacecraft was in @entity5 's shadow			1
the cameras were turned toward @entity5 and the sun so that the planet and rings are backlit the images were obtained with the @entity2 wide - angle camera on oct. 17 , 2012 at a distance of approximately 500,000 miles ( 800,000 kilometers ) from @entity5			1
images were taken using infrared , red and violet spectral filters were combined to create this enhanced - color view			0
image scale at @entity5 is about 30 miles per pixel ( 50 kilometers per pixel )			0
looking back towards the @entity17 is a geometry referred to by planetary scientists as ' high solar phase '			0
this is a very scientifically advantageous and coveted viewing position as it can reveal details about both the rings and atmosphere that can not be seen in lower solar phase			0
' of all the many glorious images we have received from @entity5 , none are more strikingly unusual than those taken from @entity5 ’s shadow , ' said @entity51 , @entity2 ’s imaging team lead based at the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55			1
' they unveil a rare splendor seldom seen anywhere else in our solar system			0
' the mosaic released does not contain @entity62			0
along with the @entity17 , our planet is hidden behind @entity5			0
however , it was taken when @entity2 was closer to @entity5 and therefore shows more detail in the rings than the one taken in 2006			2
the new mosaic is composed of 60 images taken in the violet , visible and near infrared part of the spectrum and processed in false color			1
also captured in this image are two of @entity5 's moons : @entity77 and @entity78 , and both appear on the left side of the planet , below the rings			2
@entity77 is closer to the rings ; @entity78 is below and to the left			0
the last time @entity2 had such an unusual perspective on @entity5 and its rings , at sufficient distance and with sufficient time to make a full system mosaic , occurred in september 2006 when it captured a mosaic , processed to look like natural color , entitled ' in @entity5 ’s @entity92 ' in that mosaic , planet earth put in a special appearance , making “ in @entity96 ” one of the most popular @entity2 images to date			1
@entity2 's previous mosiac , made up of 165 images taken by the @entity2 wide - angle camera over nearly three hours on sept. 15 , 2006 a ' raw ' version of the image above , with colour correction removed			1

image was taken by @entity3 's @entity2 after engineers positioned it inside the planet 's shadow
stunning mosaic is made up of 60 different images all captured on *october* 17th
