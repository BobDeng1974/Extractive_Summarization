a supercomputer that was supposed to help @entity2 ’s security service track terror suspects will not be ready in time for the @entity3			1
@entity4 has sacked a firm of it consultants after the company failed to meet deadlines to implement the new intelligence - checking system			1
the computer system is designed to help @entity4 officers carry out secret searches on suspects , including those who may pose a threat at the @entity3			1
posing a threat : the computer system is designed to help officers at @entity4 ( pictured ) carry out secret searches on suspects but spy chiefs have admitted that the software will not be ready in time to be safely trialled before the start of the @entity24 later this month			1
the new ‘ electronic records management ’ system will bring together all @entity4 intelligence material , so officers can carry out complete searches of old and current records			1
for example , it would alert officers more quickly to archived intelligence on a terror suspect who had been dormant or lying low for a number of years			2
the it failure comes days after the government announced that private security firm @entity39 had failed to hire enough guards for the @entity3			2
ministers have been forced to call upon the @entity42 to make up the shortfall			0
one security source said of the @entity4 it project : ‘ of course it would be better if this was up and running in time for the @entity3 as it allows officers to search all their systems in one quick check			1
in a fast - moving investigation , with finite resources , delay can mean the difference between success and failure			0
’ the new search facility is understood to work in a similar way to the high - tech computers used in the @entity60 tv series @entity61 , where spies match pictures , names and mobile phone numbers to identify suspects from their records			1
last night , security sources declined to name the company at the centre of the it controversy			0
nor would they say exactly why the firm had its contract terminated			0
but it is understood that the project , which is estimated to have already cost up to £ 1 million , has been plagued by technical and commercial difficulties			1
computer crisis : spy chiefs have admitted that the software will not be ready in time to be safely trialled before the start of the @entity24 the decision to postpone implementation until after the @entity3 leaves the taxpayer out of pocket while @entity4 must find a replacement contractor			1
it has emerged that @entity87 , director - general of the security service , has voiced concerns about a number of costly it security contracts , including the one that has been terminated			0
in a report published on thursday by mps from the @entity96 , mr @entity87 is quoted as saying : ‘ i think it would be a fair criticism to say that we have had some cases where [ our use of consultants and contractors ] has n’t been as controlled as it should , [ but now ] we have got a proper focus			0
‘ post-olympics , we intend to reduce [ the ] number of organisations and individuals we deal with and to manage those relationships more aggressively than we have done			0
’ a @entity111 security source said that the decision to postpone introducing the system until after the @entity3 was ‘ taken some time ago ’ on the grounds that it would be too risky to introduce new software just before the @entity3			2
he said that while the delay would affect the service ’s capability ‘ nobody was saying we desperately need the new system immediately now ’			0
it has also emerged that almost 500 officers from across @entity4 , @entity123 and @entity124 have left the secret services in the past year at a cost of £ 47 million to the taxpayer			1
many of the senior staff have been paid six - figure sums to take early retirement while others have been given big redundancy payoffs			2
the figures , in the report by the @entity96 , are : the 24 @entity123 staff were paid a total of £ 4 million to leave the service as part of a drive to remove some of the most expensive spies from the payroll			1
at the government ’s secret listening post , @entity124 , 255 staff left under the @entity147 terms in 2010/11			1
the cost to the taxpayer of these exit packages was £ 23 million			1
but the director of @entity124 , @entity152 , told mps he had been forced to offer early retirement to reduce staff numbers and stay within budget			1
he said : ‘ we lost a number of more senior members of staff			2
as i shook hands with each of them , i felt a degree of regret , but we needed to get our figures down in order to hit our own @entity168 commitments			0
’ in the security service , 216 staff left under the service ’s @entity173 ( @entity172 ) scheme in 2010/11			1
of these , 103 staff left voluntarily and the remaining 113 were redundancies			2
the cost to the taxpayer was £ 20 million			1
@entity87 told the committee that part of the reason for the redundancy programme was to ‘ [ change ] the staff mix ’ , and that ‘ in this sort of world where technologies come and go in a fortnight , some of the staff that we had			2
were n’t really the right people ’			0
the mps also said that all three agencies were struggling to retain staff as the private sector continued to offer @entity144 - trained spies and cyber experts much bigger pay packets			2
before the @entity202 security fiasco , about 12,000 officers were due to be on duty at @entity3 venues on peak days criminal trials are being delayed until after the @entity3 because of the crisis over security			0
police officers due to testify at hearings across the country are instead being called on to assist at the games			0
it was not clear last night how many cases will be affected , but the figure may run into the hundreds			0
on average , about 40,000 criminal cases are heard in @entity218 and @entity219 every week			2
there is also concern that defendants will be kept in custody for longer than usual , at a cost to taxpayers of more than £ 100 a night			1
district judge @entity225 , who was last week trying to arrange a trial date for an assault case in @entity228 , said in court : ‘ we can have no police officer cases during the @entity3			0
’ before the @entity202 security fiasco , about 12,000 officers were due to be on duty at @entity3 venues on peak days			0
but hundreds more are now required to do the work of private guards in a further blow to the already over-stretched criminal justice system			0
adding to the sense of justice being put on hold , courts in and around @entity239 will close during the two - week games because of the transport chaos			0
the @entity245 will lose half of its 18 courts , and some judges are understood to have been urged to go on holiday .			0
