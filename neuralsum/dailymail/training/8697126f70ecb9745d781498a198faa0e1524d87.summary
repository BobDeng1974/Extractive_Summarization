‘ @entity11 has been playing very well for @entity33 in @entity34 and @entity9 has been working away as well at @entity35 , adding bits to his game over the last year or two , and he will call the line - outs			1
they are both very mobile , both very capable of picking the ball up and carrying it			0

it ’s been done here at @entity2 before but it ’s great to see it happen again			0
they will be playing for each other and i ’m looking forward to it			0
@entity7 coach @entity0 has named a youthful squad for his side 's opening game at @entity2 ‘ being brothers may help them play together but the fact of the matter is that they have made it very easy for me to pick them together because they have been playing very well			1
that ’s the key to their selection			0

‘ on a personal level , i ’m absolutely excited about this game , which is my first at @entity2 , and really looking forward to see the team run out for the match and to experience the atmosphere at my first home game			0
’ @entity0 said he was confident that @entity62 and @entity64 , whose only cap came against @entity101 in the summer , would be able to cope with playing in front a passionate home crowd and the fact there were so many of their @entity35 team - mates in the starting xv would help them both			1
