by @entity0 @entity1 has faced criticism even from his own party over the scheme justice secretary @entity5 is under pressure to reverse a ban on books being sent to prisoners which has been branded ‘ unenlightened ’ by senior @entity12 colleagues			1
the restriction on reading material being sent to prisoners by family and friends is part of a new ‘ incentives and earned privileges ’ regime introduced by the @entity22			2
the scheme has caused uproar among writers and civil liberties groups - one of which likened it to measures seen at the @entity31			1
they argue there should be no restrictions on access to books in prisons , supposed to be places of rehabilitation and education			1
even senior conservatives who normally back mr @entity1 ’s hardline approach are uneasy			1
one senior @entity12 minister said : ‘ @entity5 wins the prize for the government ’s least enlightened minister			1
he has no backing for this from any quarter at all			0
’ the justice secretary insisted last night that parcels being sent into prisons had been a vehicle for ‘ contraband ’ and there were not enough staff to check them all properly			1
he insisted prisoners could access books from jail libraries and could purchase more using money earned by working inside			1
‘ parcels are an obvious conduit for getting drugs into prisons			0
if we allowed all prisoners to have access to parcels from home , it would be an impossible volume of post to go through systematically , ’ mr @entity1 said			0
the move is part of a bigger shift towards an ' incentive and earned privileges ' regime introduced by @entity22 ‘ what we have done is set out rules that say when people can have parcels from home			1
the idea that we are banning access to books for prisoners is frankly ridiculous			2
‘ all prisoners can have up to 12 books in their cell , and all prisons have libraries which prisoners have access to			1
they can buy any book they want to with their prison earnings , with the approval of prison staff			2
’ but @entity96 , executive director of legal charity @entity97 said : ‘ this move is reminiscent of the heavy - handed measures we have seen at @entity31 - where the @entity102 authorities have banned a wide range of books , from @entity105 to @entity106			1
‘ it is deeply disturbing to see @entity5 now taking his lead from one of the world ’s most notorious prisons			1
’ @entity112 , the director of the @entity113 , said banning books being sent to prisons was ‘ despicable and nasty ’			2
‘ the rules governing possessions of prisoners are arcane and not consistently applied by every prison			0
these new restrictions relate to a downgrading of the system of rewards and punishments , ostensibly designed to encourage prisoners to comply with prison rules			2
@entity127 , left , and @entity128 , right , are two big names who have come out against the new prison scheme ‘ if the @entity22 allows prisoners to be sent credit from outside , then why on earth would they ban friends and family from sending in books and insist instead that prisoners must buy the books themselves ? ‘ almost all a prisoner ’s weekly allowance would be spent on just one title			1
even the most ardent book lovers tend not to spend all of their weekly wage on what they read			0
‘ it is common for prisoners to spend 20 hours a day in their cells during the week			0
at weekends they can be cooped up from friday lunchtime until monday morning			0
being able to read a book is a lifeline and a way of nourishing the mind			0
’ prisons in @entity158 offer inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by reading books			2
inmates in four federal jails earn four days off their time inside for every book they read , meaning they would have to work their way through 12 to trim a maximum 48 days off their sentence each year			0
they are given up to four weeks to read a book and write an essay on it , which must ‘ make correct use of paragraphs , be free of corrections , use margins and legible joined - up writing ’			0
an expert panel determines which inmates are eligible to participate			0
she insisted prison libraries were not a satisfactory alternative as they were run by local authorities , many of which were now seeking to cut costs			1
tv historian professor @entity128 said : ‘ i am with the excellent @entity113 on this one			0
it just ca n’t be a sensible idea			0
’ author @entity127 said : ‘ from visits to prisons and talking to prisoners , i know how important books can be in promoting literacy and connecting prisoners to society			2
’ @entity199 ’s shadow justice secretary @entity198 said if the government wanted to rehabilitate prisoners it ‘ would be encouraging reading , not making it more difficult than it already is ’			1
‘ half of all male prisoners have no qualifications and the number of those in jail who ca n’t read and write is a national disgrace			0
two - fifths of all prisoners have the average reading age of an 11 - year - old , ’ he added			0
‘ this ridiculous policy shows just how low @entity5 has plumbed the depths in his approach to running our justice system			1
’ the new regime prevents prisoners being sent parcels , previously allowed at the discretion of jail governors , except in exceptional circumstances such as for provision of medical supplies			0
reform campaigners say that as well as books , other items , such as underwear and stationery , are being restricted			0
inmates have to buy items from prison shops instead			2
prisons minister @entity236 said : ‘ under the incentives and earned privileges scheme , if prisoners engage with their rehabilitation and comply with the regime they can have greater access to funds to buy items , including books			1

even senior @entity12 have criticised @entity5 **'s** hardline approach
new restrictions would stop prisoners being sent books from the outside
it is part of a wider shift towards using incentive scheme in prisons
civil liberties groups have compared scheme to those at @entity31
they also claim it *undermines* prison **'s** ability to rehabilitate and educate
justice secretary claims it is too time - consuming to check all packages
he also says inmates can use prison libraries or buy their own books
