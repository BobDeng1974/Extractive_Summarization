a barrister and @entity3 graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare - dodger to be prosecuted , a court heard			1
@entity6 , 43 , is said to have caused a loss of £ 23,000 to @entity8 over a two - and - a - half year period			1
he travelled from his @entity11 home to @entity12 but pretended to have only gone from @entity13 , in north west @entity12			1
@entity6 , 43 , is said to have caused a loss of £ 23,000 to @entity8 over two - and - a - half years @entity6 admits six counts of fraud by false representation between april 2012 and november last year the @entity19 - born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to £ 9,714.40 in fares , claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket , and take into account annual leave			1
but prosecutor @entity26 told @entity27 : ' if it is accepted that the loss was £ 23,000 , this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the @entity32			2
' @entity33 have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it			0
' the train company are experts , not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed , you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket , you calculate it on a full single fare , of the return for the day , each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket '			2
@entity6 admits six counts of fraud by false representation between april 2012 and november last year			2
@entity6 claimed to have travelled from @entity13 , in @entity12 , instead of @entity59 , @entity11 the scam began to unravel for @entity6 when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at @entity12 last november			1
the @entity62 claimed to have travelled from @entity13 , instead of @entity59 , @entity11 , where he and his wife live in a £ 550,000 five - bedroom detached home			1
@entity6 was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor			2
when he turned his back @entity6 ran away , but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day			0
an investigation was carried out by @entity73 , which found the lawyer had dodged fares since april 2012			0
the lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law , despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an @entity83 children 's charity and director of leading think - tank , the @entity86 , aimed at ' promoting prosperity '			2
a court heard how the barrister got off at @entity12 ( pictured ) by tapping out with an oyster card it is understood he did so by boarding a train at @entity94 and @entity95 without a ticket , and then getting off at @entity12 by simply tapping out with an oyster card			1
because there was no start point to his journey , the automated system charged him the maximum @entity104 fare , which is currently £ 7.60			0
but this is still far less than the £ 19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home			0
the case was adjourned until july 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to @entity8			0
@entity6 was released on unconditional bail			0
the deception places him among the ranks of @entity32 's biggest fare dodgers , closely behind a former millionaire fund manager			1
@entity119 was banned from working in the @entity120 last year after avoiding £ 43,000 in train fares from his home in @entity123 , @entity124			0
@entity119 had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing @entity129 trains the full amount in unpaid tickets , accrued over five years , within three days of being caught .			0

@entity6 , 43 , travelled from @entity94 and @entity59 to @entity12
but pretended to have gone from @entity13 and tapped out with @entity135 card
deception places him among the ranks of @entity32 's biggest fare dodgers
