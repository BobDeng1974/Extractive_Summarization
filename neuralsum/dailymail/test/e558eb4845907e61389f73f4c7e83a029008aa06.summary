a formerly obese man has revealed how he finally became motivated to lose 160lbs from his 354lbs frame over the course of 20 months , after nearly a lifetime of emotional eating and self - loathing			1
@entity7 - based writer @entity6 , 27 , admitted that he once made excuses for his gluttonous habits , which included trips to drive - through restaurants up to four times a day , but it was n't until an obese friend ' unveiled a shockingly svelte silhouette ' that he was inspired to make changes in his own life ' there are a lot of platitudes about weight , ' he wrote in an essay for @entity23			1
' one of them is that you should love yourself no matter your size			2
i ’m here to say that ’s bullsh * *			2
i love myself way more now than i ever have			0
' for those who can do something about their size , and simply refuse to , trust me : life is so much better on the other side , ' he explained			0
@entity6 said that he could n't think of a ' specific catalyst ' that prompted him to gain weight , but he recalled that he had an insatiable appetite ' as an only child with unabated access to nearly everything '			1
as he got older , he grew bigger , and by the time he was in college , he found himself struggling with physical intimacy because of his size			0
@entity6 recalled one woman who called him out for breathing heavily during one of their sexual encounters			1
he confessed that the panting was because he was winded - not because he was caught up in the heat of the moment			2
but the worse he felt about himself , the more he ate			0
' i ’ve never tried drugs , but i empathize with those addicted to the needle , or the pipe , ' he wrote			0
' i know what it feels like to be acutely aware your vice is killing you , or at the very least , keeping you from living your best life			0
@entity6 explained attempted to lose weight a few times , but neither the promise of an extended football career or a new car could motivate him to stick with it because he was unable to ' escape food 's gravitational pull '			1
it was n't until he saw his friend @entity88 , who once had a similar frame to his , show off his fit new body at a @entity92 reunion that he became motivated to start making changes in his own life			2
days later , @entity6 went walking , and eventually his walks turned into runs			1
he made dietary changes too , including swapping burgers for lean rotisserie chicken			0
it took a little less than two years to reach his ' physical ideal ' , and @entity6 explained that his whole world has changed			1
his only regret is not doing it sooner			0
@entity6 noted that not only is he now comfortable with the opposite sex , but for the first time in his life , he is the one who is being pursued			2
he is thrilled that he can finally buy clothes off the rack at stores such as @entity112 , adding that he finally feels like he physically fits in			0
@entity6 ended his story by saying that he finally started his life at 25 - years - old , and to remind others struggling with their weight , that if he can do it , they can do it too .			1

it took @entity7 - based writer @entity6 20 months to lose the weight from his 354lbs frame
the 27 - year - old said he used to visit the drive - through to get fast food three or four times a day
