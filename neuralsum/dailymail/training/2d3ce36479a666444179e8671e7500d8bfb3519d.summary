by @entity0 published : 18:34 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 19:02 est , 1 october 2012 the pensions revolution affecting up to 11million workers began yesterday			1
it is the biggest shake - up of pensions for more than a century and was hailed by ministers as ‘ a truly radical social change ’			1
for the first time , every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers , who will be automatically signed up to the scheme			1
pensions minister @entity13 , pictured , said the start of auto - enrolment , whereby for the first time every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers , is a ' major milestone ' yesterday the first workers were ‘ enrolled ’ into the new pension schemes , with around 800,000 expected to be signed up before @entity22			1
most workers aged between 22 and state pension age who are not members of a pension scheme will be signed up to a pension by their boss , known as automatic enrolment			1
only the lowest earners , whose annual salary is £ 8,105 or less , will be exempted from the scheme			1
workers who are auto - enrolled will join either a company scheme or the @entity38 , known as @entity38			1
at present , the majority of private sector workers do not put any money into a pension			1
if they do have a pension pot , it is worth an average of just £ 26,000			0
under the new scheme , if a 30 - year - old saved £ 50 a month , the pot would be worth around £ 90,000 at the age of 65 , if the fund grew by 7 per cent a year			2
a £ 90,000 pension pot buys a 65 - year - old man a pension of about £ 4,850 per year			0
a £ 26,000 pot buys an annual pension of about £ 1,500			0
the scheme was suggested by @entity58 in 2005 when he was asked by the @entity60 government to try to solve @entity62 ’s pensions crisis , but the launch has been a long time coming			2
pensions minister @entity13 said yesterday that the start of auto - enrolment represents ‘ a major milestone ’ for workers as well as the government ’s attempt to solve the crisis			2
‘ few policies affect as many people and this will be a truly radical social change , ’ he said			1
under the new scheme , if a 30 - year - old saved £ 50 a month , the pot would be worth around £ 90,000 at the age of 65 ‘ i ’m determined to make sure that pensions are no longer seen as the preserve of the few			2
’ he said it made a break from many other @entity69 reforms which he described as ‘ just awful and horrible ’			0
mr @entity13 hailed the shake - up as the biggest pensions revolution since state pensions were introduced by a 1908 @entity85			2
the @entity86 , @entity62 ’s biggest business lobby group , said it is the start of ‘ a new dawn for pension savers ’ which it said will ‘ tackle the ticking retirement time bomb ’			0
workers will pay into their pension – but so will their boss and the government will also make its own contribution through tax relief			2
contributions will begin low but will rise to 4 per cent of salary from workers , 3 per cent from their boss and 1 per cent from tax relief in october 2018 , making a total of 8 per cent of salary			2
workers will have the right to opt out immediately if they do not want to save into a pension for whatever reason , but bosses have no right to encourage , or even force , them to opt out			0
the government admits it expects around a third of workers will opt out , with many expected to say they simply can not afford to save at the current time			1
@entity62 ’s biggest companies will be the first to enrol their workers , a process which began yesterday , followed by smaller businesses over the next six years			0
in october , around 380,000 workers will be signed up , followed by a further 420,000 in november , and workers will continue to be signed up over the next few years			1
between february and may next year , around 6.5million will be automatically enrolled			0
nobody can escape , from @entity125 having to enrol workers who are not currently in the supermarket ’s pension scheme to a couple who employ a nanny to look after their young children			1
an advertising campaign featuring tv stars such as @entity136 and @entity137 was launched recently to raise awareness of the shake - up			0
@entity140 , director of savings at the @entity142 , said : ‘ automatic enrolment is an opportunity not to be missed			0
‘ it can not be stressed enough how important it is to save for retirement			0
‘ the fact that we are living longer is great , but we can no longer have our heads in the sand about how we fund our income in retirement			0
‘ the state pension is a foundation , but most people need more and the earlier people start to save the easier they will find it to build enough savings for their later life			0
’ the shake - up comes after official figures showed the number of private sector workers with a company pension scheme has collapsed to its lowest level since records began in 1953			1
of the country ’s 23.9million private sector workers , only 2.9million are paying into a company pension scheme			1
at their peak in 1967 , there were 8.1million members .			0

new scheme has been hailed by ministers as ' truly radical social change '
800,000 workers are expected to be signed up before @entity22
