by @entity1 reporter published : 21:09 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 21:19 est , 26 february 2013 the responsibility for preventing blowouts like the 2010 @entity5 disaster that killed 11 workers and spawned the nation 's worst offshore oil spill should be shared by @entity9 and it 's contractors , claims a senior executive for the oil company			1
@entity9 , who was president of @entity9 at the time of the disaster , became the first @entity9 executive to testify at a federal trial intended to identify the causes of @entity9 's @entity20 well blowout and assign percentages of blame to the companies involved			1
rig owner @entity25 and cement contractor @entity24 are also defendants at trial , which opened monday			2
' ' i think that 's a shared responsibility , to manage the safety and the risk , ' said @entity35 , now chief executive of @entity9 's @entity46 unit			1
' sometimes contractors manage that risk			0
most of the time it 's a team effort			0
' @entity35 also defended @entity9 's internal probe of the spill , which outlined a series of mistakes by rig workers and faulted decisions by other companies but did n't assign any blame to @entity9 's upper - level management			1
' i think it was a substantial investigation , ' @entity35 said			0
' i think we 've learned what we can from the accident and we 're trying to put those things into practice right now			0
' @entity35 , whose testimony will resume wednesday , called the disaster a ' tragic accident ' resulting from a ' risk that was identified			0
' protesters outside the @entity74 court where a judge will determine liability in the 2010 deepwater horizon oil rig explosion and spill in the @entity79 protesters display placards as the trial against @entity9 at the @entity82 in @entity74 , @entity83 it was n't the first time @entity35 testified under oath about the spill			1
he appeared before @entity87 less than a month after the explosion			0
@entity90 district judge @entity89 is hearing the case without a jury			2
barring a settlement , @entity89 will decide how much more money @entity9 and other companies owe for their roles in the disaster			0
@entity35 's testimony followed that of an expert witness for people and businesses suing the company			0
@entity105 engineering professor @entity104 testified that @entity9 did n't implement a two - year - old safety management program on the rig , which exploded on april 20 , 2010			1
' it 's a classic failure of management and leadership in @entity9 , ' said @entity111 , a former @entity9 consultant who also investigated the 1989 @entity113 spill and @entity74 levee breaches after @entity115 in 2005			1
@entity9 has said its ' @entity116 ' was designed to drive a rigorous and systematic approach to safety and risk management			1
activists protest outside a @entity74 courtroom over the @entity5 oil rig spill fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the offshore oil rig @entity5 , off @entity83 , in this april 21 , 2010 file image oil can be seen in the @entity79 , more than 50 miles southeast of @entity129 on @entity83 's tip , as a large plume of smoke rises from fires on @entity9 's @entity5 offshore rig in april 2010 during cross-examination by a @entity9 lawyer , @entity111 said the company made ' significant efforts ' to improve safety management as early as 2003			1
however , the plaintiffs say @entity9 only implemented its new safety plan at just one of the seven rigs the company owned or leased in the @entity79 at the time of the disaster			1
@entity111 said it was ' tragic ' and ' egregious ' that @entity9 did n't apply its own safety program to the @entity5 before the @entity20 well blowout			1
@entity25 owned the rig ; @entity9 leased it			2
@entity9 lawyer @entity154 said the company allows contractors like @entity25 to take the primary responsibility for the safety of rig operations as long as the contractor 's safety system is compatible with @entity9 's - an arrangement that @entity154 suggested is a standard industry practice			1
in his may 2010 congressional testimony , @entity35 said @entity9 's @entity116 is ' as good as anyone			2
' ' i know of nothing that points me in a direction that we have deficiencies ' in the system , @entity35 said			0
as he questioned @entity111 , @entity154 recited a long list of steps that @entity9 took to improve safety , citing them as evidence that the company was n't ' cutting corners ' on safety			2
a plaintiffs ' lawyer showed @entity111 a transcript of a deposition of @entity183 , @entity9 's ceo at the time of the disaster			0
@entity183 was asked if the blowout could have been averted if @entity9 had implemented the safety management program in the @entity79			2
' there is possible potential , ' @entity183 responded			0
' @entity111 said @entity9 's ' culture of every dollar counts ' was reflected in a may 2009 email sent by @entity9 well team leader @entity193 : ' the @entity195 embraced every dollar matters since i arrived 18 months ago , ' guide wrote			0
' we have saved @entity9 millions and no one had to tell us			0
' ' financially , @entity9 had the resources to effectively put into place a process safety system that could have prevented the @entity20 disaster , ' @entity111 testified			2
a decomposed fish lies in the water as workers pick up oil balls from the @entity5 oil spill in @entity209 , @entity210 more than three months after the april 2010 disaster a member of @entity83 gov. @entity214 's staff wearing a glove reaches into thick oil on the surface of the northern regions of @entity219 in @entity220 , @entity83 in june 2010 @entity9 has already pleaded guilty to manslaughter and other criminal charges and has racked up more than $ 24 billion in spill - related expenses , including cleanup costs , compensation for businesses and individuals , and $ 4 billion in criminal penalties			1
@entity230 ' attorney @entity229 read portions of the plea agreement as he pressed @entity35 to say how much responsibility @entity9 takes for the catastrophe			2
@entity235 noted that nothing in the document assigns blame to specific @entity9 executives			0
' that is not written in there			0
that 's true , ' @entity35 said			0
two @entity9 rig supervisors , however , have been indicted on manslaughter charges for the workers ' deaths and are awaiting a separate trial			1
' there were some misinterpretations and mistakes made ' on the rig , @entity35 said			0
one of the biggest questions facing @entity89 is whether @entity9 acted with gross negligence			1
under the @entity254 , a polluter can be forced to pay a minimum of $ 1,100 per barrel of spilled oil ; the fines nearly quadruple to about $ 4,300 a barrel for companies found grossly negligent , meaning @entity9 could be on the hook for nearly $ 18 billion .			1

billions are at stake in a @entity74 courtroom in the *damages* trial which began this week
@entity90 *prosecutors* are determined to prove that gross negligence caused the april 20 , 2010 blast that killed 11 workers and sank the @entity9 - leased @entity5 rig
@entity9 executive @entity9 told the court on *tuesday* that safety and risk are a ' shared responsibility '
the oil giant is determined to avoid a finding of gross negligence , which would *drastically* increase its *environmental* fines to as much as $ *17* billion
