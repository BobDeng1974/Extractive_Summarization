by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 22 april 2014 updated : 18:13 est , 22 april 2014 though it will come as little consolation to @entity3 , his enforced departure from @entity5 was almost inevitable from the moment he walked into @entity8			1
probably no successor , no matter how talented , could have banished the spectre of the fire - breathing , gum - chewing , trophy - winning sir @entity13			1
indeed , i rather suspect @entity3 's biggest mistake was to take the job in the first place			1
great leader : former @entity5 manager sir @entity13 got his send off last april feeble : @entity13 's successor as @entity5 manager @entity3 but you do n't have to know or care anything about football to appreciate the tragic resonance of his fate			1
what business experts call ‘ succession planning ' is vital not just to the fates of clubs and corporations , but to the future of entire countries			1
this is tricky enough when a leader has been running the show for , say , the best part of a decade			1
but sir @entity13 managed @entity5 for more than 26 years , having taken over shortly before @entity39 won her third general election			1
though the @entity43 is a keen @entity45 donor , the parallels with the @entity42 are irresistible			1
like @entity39 , the former @entity5 manager was a driven , obsessive character and a serial winner who has proved impossible to replace			1
when sir @entity13 joined @entity5 , mrs @entity39 had been in power for seven years			1
already her colleagues were speculating about her successor , but as one aspiring prince after another lost favour , the crown eventually fell to the unheralded figure of @entity58			1
@entity59 and her successor @entity58 portrayed in 90s tv comedy @entity61 like @entity3 , mr @entity58 never really succeeded in winning over hard - core supporters and was widely seen as a grey , insubstantial figure after the charismatic fireworks of the @entity39 years			1
and like the sacked @entity5 manager , mr @entity58 never banished the shadow of his predecessor , who famously told the @entity70 that she intended to be a ‘ very good backseat driver ' — although sir @entity13 has always maintained he would not meddle since stepping down			1
eclipsed later , mr @entity58 described mrs @entity39 's behaviour as ‘ intolerable '			1
but the truth is that had he been a more popular , compelling and impressive leader , then no one would have cared what @entity39 thought			1
the paradox , though , is that great men and women rarely pick figures of the same stature to succeed them , perhaps because their sheer competitiveness means they can not countenance the thought of being eclipsed by a rival			1
even the @entity87 never found an answer			1
their first emperor , @entity89 , ruled for 41 years and died peacefully in his bed			1
but the final years of his life were blighted by his unsuccessful efforts to find a plausible heir			1
eventually @entity89 picked his rough - hewn stepson @entity94 , who had none of his charm and proved a very dodgy successor indeed , spending much of his time interfering with small boys in his private villa on the island of @entity102			1
sir @entity103 enjoyed a stunning career as the chief executive of @entity106 , presiding over an unprecedented expansion between 1997 and 2011 he was succeeded in turn by the deranged @entity109 , the stammering @entity110 and the narcissistic @entity111			1
for decades , therefore , @entity89 's shadow hung over @entity114 politics — both an inspiration and a curse , like some ancient version of @entity39			2
our own history is full of similar stories			2
so it was that while the grim @entity122 reformed the law , conquered the @entity124 and hammered the @entity125 , his feckless son @entity126 lost the battle of @entity128 , was ousted by his wife and ended up on the wrong end of a red - hot poker			2
and while dashing @entity133 smashed the @entity134 at @entity135 , his dreamy son @entity132 lost @entity137 's possessions in @entity134 , was stripped of the crown during the @entity139 and was murdered in the @entity140			2
even @entity141 , probably the outstanding leader in our history , made a mess of the succession			2
when he died in 1658 , his son @entity146 , a mild - mannered country farmer , proved hopelessly inadequate at filling his father 's shoes , and back came the @entity149 to regain the throne			2
wretched colourful as these stories may seem , they offer some intriguing lessons for modern politicians and businessmen			2
all too often , great leaders have failed to plan for the future			2
it is often said that great leaders step down voluntarily only when they know , deep down , that the wheels are about to come off , thereby leaving their successor a wretched legacy			2
but i think the reality is subtly different			2
i suspect that in politics , as in sport , great leaders use their sheer charisma to disguise the cracks that would otherwise be apparent			2
as soon as they step down , deep institutional flaws are exposed for all to see			0
@entity170 's boardrooms offer some compelling examples			0
sir @entity103 , for instance , enjoyed a stunning career as the chief executive of @entity106 , presiding over an unprecedented expansion between 1997 and 2011			0
yet for the past two years , @entity106 's profits have fallen			0
certainly there are deeper factors at play , from rising food prices to competition from @entity182 and @entity183 , but sir @entity103 's retirement surely played its part			0
it is a similar story at the drinks giant @entity188 , which has lost momentum after announcing the departure of chief executive @entity191			0
@entity193 's titanic chief executive sir @entity192 retired in 2011 after a 15 - year reign			0
only two months ago , @entity193 issued a profit warning that wiped more than £ 3 billion off its share price			0
would things have been radically different had sir @entity58 still been on the scene ? perhaps not			0
but the @entity199 might well have had more confidence in the engine manufacturer 's prospects			0
and in business , as in sport , confidence is often half the battle			0
at @entity208 's , for instance , the jitters have already set in , even though the long - serving chief executive @entity210 is not stepping down until july			0
when his retirement was announced earlier this year , the firm 's stock price dropped by almost 5 per cent			0
who would fancy playing @entity58 to his @entity39 ? the truth is that like medieval barons and @entity5 footballers , most of us still pay homage to the cult of the strong leader			0
once the familiar , steady hand is gone , we start to lose confidence — and the blame inevitably falls on the hapless successor			0
even the great @entity228 technology giants are not immune			0
@entity230 is not merely the largest publicly traded corporation on the planet , it has one of the most sophisticated and well - regarded brands in history			0
obscure yet many observers believe that the @entity238 giant has lost its way since the death of its founder , @entity241 , in 2011			0
his successor , the comparatively obscure @entity242 , has one of the most enviable jobs in the business world			0
yet mr @entity242 had scarcely been in the job before the muttering started			0
would you really want to be in his shoes , knowing that you would always be judged against your predecessor — and that nothing you did would ever be enough ? in one area of our national life , however , succession planning is unlikely to be too difficult			0
for my money , the leaders of @entity170 's three main parties are the least impressive trio in living memory			0
will we miss @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 when they are gone ? will their shadows hang heavy over their unfortunate successors , as sir @entity13 's silhouette looms over @entity8 ? i do n't think so .			1

the parallels between @entity13 and the @entity42 are irresistible
