up to half the food we buy from supermarkets goes in the bin despite much of it being perfectly edible , a report reveals today			1
experts say a throwaway consumer culture that undervalues food is behind the colossal waste			2
they blame confusion over sell - by dates and retailers ’ ‘ buy one , get one free ’ offers that tempt shoppers into buying more than they need			1
waste : seven million tons of food , worth more than £ 10billion , is wasted in the @entity18 every year , according to a report by the @entity20 across the country seven million tons of food , worth more than £ 10billion , is thrown away annually – costing the average household £ 480 each year			1
of the food binned by families , from fresh fruit and veg to tinned and packet produce , £ 1billion worth is still within its sell - by date and good to eat			1
the report , by the @entity20 , says that up to three quarters of vegetables grown in @entity18 ends up never being eaten , with large amounts being left in the field or rejected by supermarkets for being too ugly			1
confusion : the report 's author places some of the blame for food wastage on special offers in supermarkets that result in consumers ' buying more produce than they need ' author dr @entity45 , head of energy and environment at the @entity20 , said that over a lifetime an average household will throw away up to £ 24,000 worth of food			1
he said : ‘ between 30 and 50 per cent of food bought from supermarkets is thrown away			1
it gets home from the shops , placed in the cupboard or fridge , and then up to half of that food goes in the bin			2
‘ one of the problems is the way supermarkets retail			0
consumers end up buying more produce than they need because of special offers			0
many of these items have a limited shelf life , so they end up being thrown away			0
‘ and with much of our fresh fruit being imported from around the globe , it does not have the lifespan of locally produced food because it has already spent days travelling			0
‘ there is also confusion over labelling and sell - by dates , with many people opting to throw away perfectly good food			1
’ the average @entity18 family spends only 11 per cent of its budget on food , which explains why it is not valued more highly , the report found			1
dr @entity45 said : ‘ with the shift away from small shops on the @entity89 to large - scale supermarkets , we have lost the sense of value of food			1
’ almost a third of vegetables are never harvested and are ploughed back into the field because of overproduction and for aesthetic reasons , according to the report , @entity99 : waste not , want not			2
‘ many farmers produce more than is necessary as back - up to meet the strict criteria in the supply agreements set by supermarkets , ’ said dr @entity45			2
warning : author of the report dr @entity45 said between 30 and 50 per cent of food bought in supermarkets is thrown away and warned that people had ' lost the sense of value of food ' with a further 30 per cent never making it to the supermarket shelf because they are considered too ugly to be sold , only half a farmer ’s crop is likely to be sold			1
the misshapen produce is either left to rot in the field , sold off to be added to manufactured products such as soup , used as animal feed , or put in composting			0
but , once consumer waste is factored in , up to three - quarter of vegetables never make it on to a family ’s plate			2
dr @entity45 said : ‘ it is remarkable that you get any food to the table at all			0
up to 75 per cent of the veg grown in the @entity18 does n’t end up being eaten			1
that ’s the bottom line			0
‘ with a lot of vegetables , it is simply the fact that it just does n’t look right			0
the crop is not harvested simply because it will not sell , but apart from appearance they are perfectly edible			0
‘ although schemes are in place to sell some of this veg in different outlets , not enough is being done to tackle this waste			0
’ the picture remains the same across the globe , with around half of all food produced – two billion tons worth – lost to waste			1
but in developing countries the issue is one of storage rather than profligacy			0
others have queried the report ’s figures , with the food waste campaigners @entity157 saying only one fifth of all the food and drink we buy as consumers ends up unused in the bin			2
unused : food waste expert @entity163 said that preparing too much food was one reason for waste , while misunderstanding over labels was another factor food waste expert @entity163 said : ‘ our research has shown that 7.2million tons of food and drink waste is generated by households in the @entity18 each year			1
of this , 4.4million tons is avoidable food waste			2
this avoidable food waste has a value of £ 12billion per year			1
’ she said that preparing too much food was one reason for waste , while misunderstanding over labels was another factor			0
@entity180 , director of food and sustainability at the @entity183 , which represents retailers , said : ‘ using more of the crop to cut food waste and increase sustainable production is an objective for all retailers			0
this is how we are exceeding @entity191 targets for food waste			0
‘ it was supermarkets that lobbied @entity194 to relax strict marketing rules on fruit and veg to allow us to sell more misshapen produce			2
this has led to an enormous increase in the sale of “ wonky ” veg			0
‘ we ’ll continue to work with growers to use more @entity18 produce , cut food waste and give customers great value			1
it ’s a win , win , win			0

seven million tons of food worth £ 10billion is thrown away every year
of the wasted food £ 1billion is still within sell - by date and good to eat
three quarters of vegetables grown in @entity18 never get eaten
