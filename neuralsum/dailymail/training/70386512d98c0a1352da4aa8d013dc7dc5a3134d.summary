the disgrace of @entity2 ’s most senior @entity1 was complete last night as cardinal @entity3 admitted to sexual misconduct			1
in a shock statement , @entity5 effectively admitted that allegations that he made homosexual approaches to young trainee priests were true			1
until a week ago @entity5 , 74 , had been preparing to help choose the next @entity10			2
but last night he admitted his ‘ sexual conduct ’ had ‘ fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest , archbishop and cardinal ’			2
he said sorry and added that he was retiring from public life			2
the former archbishop will face a @entity20 investigation into his behaviour and could be subjected to further punishment if evidence of wrongdoing is found			1
apology : @entity26 has admitted his ' sexual conduct fell well below the standards expected of a priest ' his admission left the @entity1 in both @entity30 and @entity31 in deep crisis over sexual standards and apparent hypocrisy on the part of its most senior priest			1
it meant the troubles in the church in this country will be at the heart of the disputes in @entity44 as the 115 most senior cardinals begin the process of picking the new pope			2
the conclave – which does not now include any representative from @entity2 – will have to cope with both the fallout from years of sex - abuse allegations and the dramatic new evidence that even the most senior @entity1 do not always practise what they preach			1
the allegations against @entity5 , made public eight days ago , came from three priests and a former priest , who complained to the @entity20 ’s representative in @entity2 , @entity57 archbishop @entity57			1
admission : @entity26 in the office at his official residence in @entity61 last week the force of the complaints became apparent last monday when pope @entity64 ordered @entity5 to retire immediately			1
the cardinal , who had offered his retirement to the @entity10 in advance of his 75th birthday this month , obeyed the instruction and offered an apology ‘ to all whom i have offended ’			1
yesterday ’s statement said : ‘ in recent days certain allegations which have been made against me have become public			1
initially , their anonymous and non-specific nature led me to contest them			0
‘ however , i wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest , archbishop and cardinal			2
’ he added : ‘ to those i have offended , i apologise and ask forgiveness			1
to the @entity1 and people of @entity31 , i also apologise			1
i will now spend the rest of my life in retirement			0
i will play no further part in the public life of the @entity1 in @entity31			1
' if , as is likely , the @entity1 launches an inquiry into the allegations , it will be conducted at the @entity20 under the aegis of the new pope , rather than by @entity31 officials			1
the investigation 's findings might never be made public			1
three of the four men who complained about @entity5 ’s behaviour are still priests in the diocese of @entity105 and @entity61 , where until last monday , the cardinal was archbishop			1
the church in @entity31 is now under the temporary leadership of archbishop of glasgow @entity109 , who does not hold the rank of cardinal and so can not take @entity5 ’s place in the papal conclave			1
no @entity30 cleric is qualified to join the conclave			2
in the @entity119 , which first reported the story last week , the former priest who made the accusations and remains anonymous , today said he had been ' disappointed ' by the church 's reaction			1
he said : ' there have been two sensations for me this week			0
one is feeling the hot breath of the media on the back of my neck and the other is sensing the cold disapproval of the church hierarchy for daring to break ranks			2
i feel like if they could crush me , they would			0
resignation : the 74 - year - old @entity137 pictured with pope @entity64 and the @entity138 position : the archbishop was the head of the @entity1 in @entity31 and the @entity2 's senior priest ' the vacuum the church has created has allowed whimsy and speculation to distort the truth , and the only support i have been offered is a cursory email with a couple of telephone numbers of counsellors hundreds of miles away from me			1
' the former clergyman claimed that when he was a seminarian at @entity157 , in 1980 , @entity26 made an inappropriate approach to him after night prayers			1
another priest said the @entity137 visited him at his parish and that inappropriate contact took place between them , while a third complainant alleged that he was subjected to ' unwanted behaviour ' from the cleric in the 1980s after some late - night drinking			1
accused : the allegations of ' inappropriate ' behaviour have been made by three priests and a former priest the cardinal has also been accused by another member of the clergy of using night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact			1
after stepping down , @entity26 became archbishop @entity177 and @entity61 but had no role in the governance of the diocese			1
the @entity181 made no comment today , but last week its director @entity183 said the @entity137 's resignation had not been accelerated because of the allegations			2
he said : ' the timing is very unfortunate and it does appear as if one has followed the other , which in terms of chronology one has followed the other , but that 's not the same as saying one caused the other			0
' when it comes to responding to the allegations i think what he will do is act on his legal advice , and the legal advice at the moment would be to not publicly engage with the detail as it stands of the allegations			2
' another priest has called for the @entity1 in @entity31 to be more open in dealing with complaints			2
father @entity208 said : ' if the @entity1 in @entity31 is to heal itself , we need transparency and understanding			2
' we need to learn lessons from the mistakes we have made in the past and move on to become a more loving and understanding church which does not condemn victims or even abusers			2
' cardinal @entity5 ’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks			2
the vehemence of his public stand against same - sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby			0
however , in a surprise move just a day before the sex scandal broke , he upset traditionalists by calling for priests to be given the right to marry			0
in @entity44 : the @entity137 had been due to travel to the @entity20 to take part in the forthcoming papal conclave senior church figures are expected to go at 75 , but the @entity20 often allows leeway of a year or two			1
following news of the sex scandal over the weekend , the @entity10 gave @entity5 no choice			0
‘ the holy father has now decided that my resignation will take effect today , 25 february 2013 , and that he will appoint an @entity242 to govern the @entity243 in my place until my successor is appointed , ’ @entity5 said			0
the @entity137 said in his statement : ‘ i thank pope @entity64 for his kindness and courtesy to me and … i wish him a long and happy retirement			0
‘ i also ask @entity251 ’s blessing on my brother @entity137 who will soon gather in @entity44 to elect his successor			0
i will not join them for this conclave			0
i do not wish media attention in @entity44 to be focused on me – but rather on pope @entity64 and on his successor			0
’ speaking on today 's @entity263 programme , cardinal @entity259 , the former archbishop of @entity261 , said : ' it is clearly very sad			1
the person involved has apologised			0
he is now going to leave public life			0
for me my thoughts and prayers are with everyone			0
' the church has been on a learning curve			1
it has made quite sure that in the future there will be transparency and that procedures are put in place for safeguarding children			0
' there has always been sinners in the church but there has always been saints			0
the fact it has n't failed indefectibly says something about the mystery of the church			0
' in society today there are things that are wrong and for which people need to repent			0
sometimes it is the weakness of an individual			0
' the vast majority of priests and bishops are good and faithful men who are faithful to what they do , to what they preach and their way of life			0
' to say that this has sort of infected everywhere is just not true			0
' ' in regards to child protection the church itself has ensured if there are allegations made they are dealt with severely and transparently			1
' as the church goes through history it develops and faces new challenges and new questions and has to do so			0
but to change everything , i just do n't agree			0
' retiring : pope @entity64 delivers his blessing during his last @entity320 noon prayer from a @entity322 window			0
