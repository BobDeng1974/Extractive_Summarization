he may be a warrior in the ring , but @entity2 showed his humble side outside of it once more with his latest @entity6 post			1
the 36 - year - old is gearing up for his $ 300million welterweight showdown with @entity9 on may 2 - in what is set to become the richest bout in boxing history			1
but the @entity14 star took time out of his preparation to thank @entity17 film director @entity16 and @entity18 for their support so far			1
@entity2 took to @entity6 to thank @entity16 and @entity18 ahead of his bout vs @entity9 the 36 - year - old also posted a photo thanking @entity25 legend @entity24 ( centre left ) for visiting him at the gym ' hello to all my fans in @entity30 and thank you to @entity16 and @entity18 for supporting @entity32 , ' @entity2 said via @entity6 on thursday			1
' i hope to see you soon			0
' the duo are just the latest to show their support for the ' @entity38 ' ahead of his fight against @entity9 at the @entity40 in @entity41 next month			1
former two - time @entity42 and 14 - time all - star @entity24 is another who appears to be behind the camp of the southpaw boxer			2
later on thursday , @entity2 took to @entity6 again to post a picture with the 51 - year - old at his @entity48 gym base in @entity49			1
@entity2 's trainer , @entity50 , believes his man is ready to beat @entity9 in @entity41 on may 2 accompanied with the caption : ' thank you @entity24 for visiting me today			1
@entity34 bless you and your family , ' the pair are all smiles alongside trainer @entity50			0
and speaking earlier in the week , @entity50 believes that his fighter has a better chance of beating @entity9 now than he did in 2010			2
asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of @entity2 would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten @entity9 , @entity50 told @entity63 : ' that is an interesting question because there are obviously trade - offs between the two versions of @entity2			1
but i am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons			0
' back in 2010 , @entity2 was still growing into a welterweight			0
his first two welterweight fights were against @entity74 in 2008 and @entity75 in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively , and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight @entity76			0
' @entity9 has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against @entity74 so that might have given @entity9 an advantage			0
i still like @entity2 's chances in that fight but i think the @entity2 of today has a lot more in his favour			0
@entity2 is better equipped to beat @entity9 now than he was in 2010 , according to his trainer @entity50 @entity9 is looking to extend his 47 - fight unbeaten streak when he meets @entity2 next month ' in 2010 the two - year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either , but that 's not true today			1
@entity9 at 38 is doing things he did n't do in the past			0
@entity9 is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years			0
@entity9 remains the bookmakers ' favourite for the $ 300million mega-fight next month but @entity50 is adamant that @entity2 is primed to cause an upset			2
' the 2015 version of @entity2 is more mature , smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version , ' said @entity50			0
' he will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating @entity9 's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening			2
' i have all the confidence in the world that @entity2 is going to knock @entity9 out on may 2			1
' the pair will go head - to - head in a $ 300million mega-fight at the @entity40 in @entity41 on may 2			2

@entity2 fights @entity9 at the @entity40 on may 2
@entity2 took to @entity6 on thursday to thank @entity16 and @entity18
36 - year - old was also visited by @entity25 legend @entity24 at his boxing gym
