the rest of us may be wondering ' what now ? ' after @entity3 's desultory exit from the @entity4 in @entity5 , but our players know exactly what they 'll be doing - playing games on their free @entity11 consoles			1
members of the squad , including @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity16 , were seen clutching the £ 370 state - of - the - art consoles as they touched down at @entity18 this afternoon			1
the consoles - and hopefully a copy of soccer video game @entity21 so they can brush up on their skills - were handed out as part of a deal with the @entity26 manufacturer @entity25			2
there were no fans to greet them on the tarmac did n't expect to see you so soon : @entity3 manager @entity46 at @entity18			1
right , midfielder @entity47 looks thoughtful after the debacle in @entity5 an @entity50 spokesman said : ' it was a sponsorship deal for the @entity53 players were given them whilst they were away by the manufacturer , free of charge			1
' the squad touched down first in @entity37 for the northern - based players , then at @entity18 for their southern counterparts , as the under - performing stars , who finished bottom of @entity61 , swapped the glitz and glamour of the @entity64 to return to reality in @entity3			1
the players will now head to their family homes before embarking on their summer jollies to celebrity hotspots including @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 before returning to their club employers for pre-season			1
despite total apathy from fans , stars like @entity36 , @entity40 and @entity76 were met by chauffeur - driven cars next to the runway to avoid standard airport procedure and whisk them away back to their mansions after the @entity50 's privately - hired @entity85 767 landed from @entity5 shortly after quarter past one in the afternoon			1
greeting the all - white aircraft , which did n't carry any markings , were a handful of photographers , but no flag - waving fans to welcome them back following the team 's dismal early @entity4 exit			0
but it made the day of one primary school class on a day trip to see the planes			0
one - by - one , the deflated squad came down the steps and walked the few yards to their cars ; led by coach @entity102 and followed by @entity76 and @entity104 's @entity103 , wearing what looked like squad regulation navy blue shorts			2
@entity108 and @entity3 centre back @entity107			2
the loss to @entity110 , followed by @entity111 being overcome by @entity112 , sank the nation 's hopes glum : @entity116 glances at photographers as he descends the steps despite total apathy from fans , stars like @entity36 ( pictured ) , @entity40 and @entity76 were met by chauffeur - driven cars next to the runway @entity104 's musical left back @entity124 clutched the guitar that has kept him company in @entity127			0
after dropping off the northern - based players , the @entity129 - registered plane continued on to @entity18 carrying manager @entity46 and the rest of the squad			1
the muted atmosphere on a pleasant warm day in @entity37 , where the hidden private terminal sits between @entity136 and the aviation centre for plane - spotters , was in marked contrast to other receptions the @entity3 team have received in the past			1
@entity143 and her family , including her son @entity145 , four , arrived back in @entity37 after returning home from @entity5 where they watched @entity36 in the @entity4 @entity143 's wife @entity143 , pictured left , and son @entity145 , pictured right , had travelled to @entity127 to watch the star and saw him score his first ever @entity4 goal hundreds of supporters went to @entity153 in the early hours of the morning to cheer the @entity3 players when they flew in after beating @entity155 5 - 1 in 2001			1
the big four north - west clubs @entity157 , @entity108 , @entity158 and @entity104 supplied more than half of @entity3 's squad and among those also disembarking at @entity37 after the long flight from @entity163 were @entity164 , @entity107 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167			1
@entity116 , @entity168 , @entity167 and @entity169			0
@entity3 ’s already - sealed fate appears to have led to a slump in viewing for their last match of the @entity4 , with less than half the audience of the previous game tuning in			1
maybe @entity175 eh @entity76 ? the @entity3 goalie smiles to a flight attendant as he leaves the plane @entity169 's performance was a rare highlight in an otherwise derisory performance in @entity5 see you at @entity183 : @entity76 and @entity184 hug on the runway back on @entity187 soil : @entity124 , clutching his guitar , and @entity164 head towards home see you in the league : @entity158 keeper @entity76 bids a fond farewell to @entity157 's @entity169 a picture of disappointment : photographers chronicle the players ' depressing homecoming @entity197 , but funny : @entity199 's banner quips : ' at least try and maker it through baggage reclaim ' yesterday ’s 0 - 0 draw with @entity112 managed to pull in an audience which at its height was more than 9 million , with an average of 5.8 million watching throughout @entity210 ’s coverage			1
but it was a sharp drop on the numbers who saw the clash with @entity110 last week - which left @entity3 with little chance of progressing beyond the group stage - which had a 13.1 million average			1
the peak for the @entity110 game of 20.3 million - said to be the highest on @entity221 tv since the @entity223 closing ceremony - was well up on yesterday ’s peak of 9.5 million			0
yesterday ’s match in @entity226 was still the most watched programme of the evening , and the peak as the match neared its conclusion represented almost half the tv audience at that time			0
@entity233 ’s coverage of the @entity110 v @entity111 match yesterday - which included the moment in which @entity236 appeared to bite defender @entity237 - had an average of 700,000 viewers with a 2.9 million peak			0
welcome home , we suppose : the @entity3 's plane landing at @entity37 a fan with ' 66 ' written on the back - a reference to the @entity4 - winning @entity3 team of that year , watches the plane touch down now that 's dedication : fans waiting on the roof of the car park at @entity37 for the @entity3 squad to disembark a social club changed the name of its speciality @entity3 beer from @entity257 to @entity257 ’s @entity258 and dropped the price so they could cheer up their punters			1
@entity261 at the @entity263 @entity262 , 37 , created a new label for the guest beer after a paltry 12 people turned out for the @entity3 v @entity112 game on tuesday night			2
the father - of - one , from @entity270 , @entity271 , said : ' i made a label and stuck it over the name			0
i think whimper was a more appropriate name for this campaign			0
' he also reduced the price of the beer , described by brewery @entity281 as a ' rip - roaring brew ' , from £ 2.50 to £ 1.50 and decided to donate all proceeds of sales to the local kids ’ football teams at @entity287			2
@entity262 , who has been steward at the club for 18 months , said : ' the place was rammed for the last couple of games with well over 100 people coming in to watch the game			0
it ’s almost as if people forgot that they were playing			0
we ’d brought in guest beers for the qualifying stages and took on extra staff in preparation , but of course it was n’t needed on tuesday night			0
' i think at least we ended on a high because the beer went down a storm with the lads that turned up and we had a laugh and a joke about it			0
' i ’m hoping that by donating the money to youth football we might be investing in @entity3 ’s future prospects			2
' drinker @entity312 , an 80 - year - old retired boat builder , said : ' i ’ve seen a few @entity3 games over the years and calling it @entity258 seems to sum up this tournament			1
' i ’m pleased my drinking could help future @entity3 stars			2
' market trader @entity319 , 64 , said : ' @entity258 is a great beer			0
i just wish the official sponsors , @entity321 , would follow suit and reduce the cost of their beer too			0
' @entity281 ’s guest beer @entity257 was created for @entity3 ’s efforts in the @entity4 tournament			2
their website says : ' @entity281 has produced a rip - roaring beer for every @entity187 football fan to enjoy			2
' this easy drinking , ‘ belter ’ of a beer with malty , hoppy flavours and a refreshing clean , bitter " finish " is a winner every time			0
back of the net ! '			0

with just one pathetic draw under their belt , the wounded ' @entity344 ' of @entity3 *limped* home this afternoon
but at least they could ' console ' themselves with a free £ 370 next - *gen* @entity11
players will now enjoy *holidays* before *linking* up with their club sides in july
the squad finished at the bottom of group d and have swapped the *luxury* of @entity5 for @entity3
