by @entity0 published : 02:28 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 28 november 2013 a giant @entity2 suitcase which erected in the middle of @entity4 has sparked outrage among @entity6 who see the publicity stunt as an insult to the country 's communist past president @entity12 's government has strugged to contain an uproar over the nine - metre high case , which is actually a pavilion set up to house an exhibition on possessions of the rich and famous			1
critics slammed the judgement of officials who sanctioned the event , which is being held just feet away from the @entity23 and the mausoleum of @entity26 revolutionary leader @entity25			1
ill - fitting : the patterned suitcase , the likes of which are often seen as a symbol of excess and wealth , was branded an eyesore by critics @entity34 , a @entity35 member of the @entity36 , said he was ' ashamed ' of his country for allowing the pavilion to be built in such a politically significant location @entity34 , a @entity35 member of the @entity36 , the lower parliament house called it an ' eyesore ' , saying ' i am ashamed of our country for putting a suitcase on its main square , this sacred area that should be protected by the state '			1
after growing disquiet , a sign was placed on the pavilion on wednesday evening announcing it was being dismantled , though the structure remained intact			0
despite straps on the structure in the colours of the @entity6 flag , the image of a @entity56 luxury good only the richest can afford has jarred with patriotic citizens			2
climbdown : a spokesman for @entity12 said the suitcase would be dismantled after acknowledging a problem with its size @entity12 loyalists in his @entity68 party also railed against the case , with many claiming it should be moved to a more remote pare of @entity72			2
citing an unnamed @entity23 source , @entity6 news agencies said that @entity12 's administration had eventually ordered it to be removed			1
' there 's nothing terrible about the trunk itself and the good intentions - on the contrary ' @entity12 spokesman @entity76 told reporters			2
' but it is obvious that there 's a problem with the sense of scale			0
' communist supporters still visit @entity4 to see the mausoleum of the @entity26 revolutionary @entity25 while a skating rink has been set up on @entity4 for the winter holidays in recent years , the @entity23 is sensitive about use of the history - steeped expanse at @entity72 's heart			1
protest band @entity98 performed on the square a month before their ' punk prayer ' in a cathedral that resulted in jail terms , and a man who stripped naked and nailed himself to the cobbles this month may face criminal charges			0
@entity2 , whose parent company is @entity108 , had said the exhibit , which was to open on december 2 , was a tribute to its longstanding ties with @entity6 and that all revenue from it would go to the @entity114 , a children 's charity			0
the charity 's founder , model @entity116 , is the fiancee of a son of @entity120 , the ceo of @entity108			0
