@entity0 was sore , obviously heartbroken , but gracious in defeat			1
a thunderous right hook from @entity3 of @entity4 had knocked him out in the 10th round of their @entity7 world middleweight title eliminator at the @entity8 on saturday night			1
he is now left with the unappealing and likely decision to retire without winning a world title			2
a student of boxing , he pointed out fighters who had numerous title shots before reaching the summit but also name - checked legends of the sport who fought because they were fighters			0
he deserves access to that club			0
‘ look at the [ @entity25 ] @entity24 and all them — they lost many , many times and still went on and won a world title , ’ said @entity0 in his dressing - room after the fight			1
‘ how many footballers have bad games ? it ’s just in boxing you ’re as good as your last fight			0
@entity0 could be nearing retirement after suffering a devastating defeat in @entity38 ‘ it ’s a shame because now the world title looks further away and maybe it ’s just not to be for me			1
maybe that fight in @entity44 will haunt me forever			0
’ that fight in @entity44 was a reference to his 2011 points loss to @entity48 in @entity49 in a @entity51 world - title fight			2
he was awarded the decision by @entity44 tv pundits that night , but the judges , bafflingly , awarded the win to @entity48			0
in hindsight , it was his best opportunity to win a world title , despite the fact that he went on to headline at @entity63 against @entity64 and later challenged pound - for - pound monster @entity65			0
now it seems likely that this could be the end for the two - time @entity70 champion after his sixth career loss brings his record to 31 - 6			2
@entity0 was stopped by @entity3 in the 10th round of their @entity7 world title eliminator @entity3 and @entity0 went toe to toe for 10 rounds			1
after a clean left hand landed on @entity0 ’s chin , that right hook from @entity81 left the home fighter on the canvas 42 seconds into the round			1
in truth , the @entity87 - born @entity86 man looked every inch of his 32 years from the third round on and the aggregate damage of a pro career which started in his teens made him look , for the first time , a very tired fighter			1
‘ he was decent and i knew he was good , ’ said @entity0 of @entity81 afterwards			2
‘ no one wants to admit they ’re getting older but the pace of the fight … it probably suited him more than me			0
’ a constantly busy 27 - year - old @entity3 was too much to deal with			1
@entity101 celebrates victory over @entity0 in @entity38 on saturday night ‘ i ’ve got the sort of face where i show every emotion anyway , so i looked tired after a round ! ” laughed @entity0 afterwards , but the 32 - year - old is now , undoubtedly , considering retirement			1
‘ i ’ve had tough fights , tough spars and lived in f * * * ing hotel rooms all over the world ! it ’s a tough - ish life , but i ’ve had more highs than lows , definitely ...			0
i ’ll just have to see			0
’ the unusual predicament @entity0 finds will finds himself in is whether to fight on considering there is a possibility that he could yet book an @entity122 showdown with @entity124 ’s @entity123 or a date with @entity127 ’s @entity126			2
promoter @entity128 pinpointed @entity38 middleweight @entity129 as a star in the making after the 27 - year - old demolished @entity133 in one round , while he hinted that @entity136 ’s @entity135 could yet become a major player in the 160lb division after he battered @entity139 inside two minutes			1
former amateur stars @entity141 and @entity142 both recorded early stoppage wins .			0
