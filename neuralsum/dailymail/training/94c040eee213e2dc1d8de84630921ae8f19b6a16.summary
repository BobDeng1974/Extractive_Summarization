no injuries were reported , and @entity7 police officer @entity31 said passengers were never in danger			2
police announced the breach one day after @entity37 , 24 , of @entity38 , @entity34 made headlines after allegedly stumbling through security a @entity41 while dressed in women 's clothing after a ' bad date ' despite the hub 's reported $ 300 perimeter upgrade			1
according to the @entity47 , @entity37 said he felt unsafe and left his date when the man called a friend to bring them gasoline			1
police say @entity11 ( center ) , who is homeless , was spotted by airport employees after he scaled a fence while intoxicated on @entity8 in one piece : police say @entity11 ran up to a @entity15 jet and tried to bang on the engines , which an alerted pilot had already shut off workers in the @entity7 airport 's tower had spotted a man climbing the fence and running onto the tarmac and then the taxiway near @entity67			1

security on the airport 's runway system has been breached in the past			0
in november 2012 , a woman rammed through a partially open gate at the @entity7 airport and drove on the runway with her infant son in the car			0

it 's not known whether the airport has a perimeter intrusion detection system consisting of ground and motion sensors and closed - circuit cameras			0
@entity26 officials declined to comment on the security breach and referred questions to @entity7 police , who said they wo n't talk specifics about the airport 's security			2
a $ 300million dollar security system is supposed to detect any breaches on the @entity41 grounds @entity127 , an aviation professor at the @entity128 and former assistant security director at @entity130 , said perimeter intrusion detection systems might be needed at the nation 's larger airports as an extra layer , given their prominence and volume of passengers			1
still , installing such a detection system is no guarantee that breaches will be avoided			0
" there 's no such thing as airtight security , " @entity127 said			0
@entity127 said it looked as though people working in the airport tower did as they were supposed to by responding quickly			0
while perimeter fences are a key part of airport security , @entity127 said an airport relies on many layers of security , including workers required to challenge and report people on air fields who do n't have security badges .			0
