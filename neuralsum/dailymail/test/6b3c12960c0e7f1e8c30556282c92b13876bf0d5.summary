a real - life @entity0 has laid claim to making the most extravagant chocolate creation - a seven - foot - tall , five - foot - wide @entity4 made using 352lbs of chocolate			1
@entity7 's egg is so big that it took him three days to put together and is made from layers of @entity11 chocolate which covers an iron frame			1
the creation had to be completed using a step ladder and is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars			1
@entity7 with his 7ft tall easter egg which he will sell off in pieces to raise money for @entity20 mr @entity7 hopes to raise £ 1,000 from the sale of the egg for @entity20			1
the giant treat , which has since been wrapped in cellophane complete with a bow on top , was made with melted chocolate which had to be tempered overnight			1
the 58 - year - old chocolatier commissioned an iron worker to make a special frame for his egg , which was then wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film , before being covered in chocolate			1
due to the nature of chocolate contracting after it cools , mr @entity7 had to add layer upon layer of chocolate using a palette knife over a three - day period			1
he then finished the egg off using a ' rough bark ' finish			2
mr @entity7 , who has been in the chocolate business for almost three decades , currently has the egg on display at his shop @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 layers of chocolate cover an egg - shaped iron frame which the chocolatier had specially commissioned in the past he has made giant easter eggs but never one that has sized up to his current creation which measures five feet in width			1
on @entity62 the egg is to be cracked using a hammer before it is sold off to punters who have already been sizing up the egg			1
mr @entity7 said : ' it is a fair size and it makes a massive difference compared to the others i have made in the past			1
' it 's quite fortunate that the conservatory has air conditioning and that it has double doors so we can get it out			2
' the actual making was the easy part but i did have a few sleepless nights thinking about it			0
it was almost like chocolate cladding , i made big sheets of chocolate and put them on the side of the frame			2
' it 's pretty thick			2
nothing tastes quite as good as @entity4 chocolate and on @entity62 customers are going to take it apart and i 'm going to crack it with a big hammer			2
it was exhausting , but it is fantastic to see the look on people 's faces			2
' i did n't expect people would want to buy the chocolate but it helps to raise more money for the hospice			0
when they see it they almost do n't have to say anything you just have to look at their @entity109 kiddies are lost for words , one little boy who was four and funnily enough called @entity113 could n't take it in that it was an @entity4			0
i think it scared him			0
' the iron frame was wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film mr @entity7 lost his brother @entity121 , 59 , two years ago after he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and towards the end of his illness had need of the services provided by a hospice			1
he added : ' people have been very generous			0
i 'm well on target to hit the £ 1,000 mark			0
' most people know somebody who has gone through the hospice and know it 's a very important part of the health care			0
people are more than willing to support the hospice and i 've felt very proud i 've been able to help with this gesture			0
' he added : ' i 've always had a sweet tooth and on a saturday morning i used to go into the sweet shop and look at the sweets before deciding what to spend my pocket money on			0
' chocolate is my passion , i love it and working with chocolate is better than any medication or therapies			0
' i say that we 're so lucky working in this industry because 99.9 per cent of customers are always smiling when they walk in , and then they see this and are beaming			0
' when i look at it i think " wow " but now i 'm beginning to think " what can i do next " - next year i 'll perhaps need a crane and scaffolding			0
