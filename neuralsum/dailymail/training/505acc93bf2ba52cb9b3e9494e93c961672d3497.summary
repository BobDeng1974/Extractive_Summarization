by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 19:44 est , 1 october 2012 the end of unwanted calls and texts from marketing firms could be in sight after two men responsible for millions of spam texts to mobile phone users were told they face a £ 250,000 fine			1
the case , the first of its kind , is part of a wider crackdown by watchdogs on marketing texts and recorded message calls sent at random and without permission			2
tens of thousands of people have complained about being subjected to a constant stream of nuisance texts , often from claims firms promising to pursue personal injury claims or payment protection insurance refunds			2
seen this before ? many have been annoyed by the amount of nuisance texts promising payment protection insurance refunds the messages are sent in breach of legislation that should stop mobile phones and landlines from being targeted unless permission has been granted by an individual			2
the @entity37 has received more than 30,000 complaints about spam texts in the past six months and is calling on victims to help identify the culprits by registering the details on its website			1
separately , the @entity37 , the telecoms watchdog , @entity46 , and consumer groups have launched a new guide to stopping the nuisance texts and calls			1
the @entity37 's director of operations , @entity51 , said : ' the public have told us that they are increasingly concerned about the illegal marketing texts and calls			1
' these are often made by rogue companies claiming to offer pay - outs for accidents a person has never had or payment protection insurance ( @entity62 ) claims that they are not necessarily entitled to			0
' while companies can phone people to sell them the latest product or service , the law states that individuals should not receive unsolicited texts or automated marketing calls unless they have given their permission			2
phone owners should not receive unwanted automated calls - but many companies flout the law and ring them anyway - much to the anger of many ' we know many companies are failing to do this and two individuals responsible for sending millions of illegal marketing messages are now facing six - figure penalties unless they can prove otherwise			1
' the two people have 28 days to provide a reason why the fine should not be imposed under the @entity88 and @entity89			2
if they fail to offer a satisfactory defence , the fine will go ahead and they will be named and shamed - but until then , they can not be identified			2
warning that this was just the first of many fines , mr @entity51 said : ' we are already working to identify other individuals and companies involved in these unlawful practices			0
' @entity51 and the @entity37 are cracking down on those behind the nuisance texts eight companies are currently under investigation and they have been put on notice that they face action , including fines , unless they can prove they are not issuing unwanted marketing texts			1
mr @entity51 described the decision to start imposing large fines as an important step			0
' this shows those who blatantly break the law will be in line for a sizeable six - figure penalty from the @entity37 , ' he said			1
' while honest mistakes can occasionally be made , we will look to take action against individuals and companies that continue to break the law			0
' the @entity37 says tens of thousands of unwanted spam messages are sent out every day			1
a spokesman told the @entity120 that the same message will be sent out to numbers that are generated on a computer and , if people respond , confirms the number is active and is worth contacting again			0
if someone was to respond with their details - for example , explaining about an accident in response to a @entity62 text message , the company that sent the spam message has more valuable information about the recipient			0
the companies can then send details of the active numbers , and any details about the person , to other companies			0
the spokesman said : ' this is a hugely profitable and lucrative business , and one that we are trying to stamp out			0
' complaints about cold - calling telemarketing firms and spam text messages rose more than 40 per cent last year			2
in july figures revealed there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) in 2011/12 , up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year			1
a @entity155 investigation in july claimed that the government - regulated service , the @entity158 , intended to allow people to block cold callers , was being ignored by some telemarketing firms			0
an exact total of 7,095 complaints were received under the @entity88 and @entity165 ( @entity166 ) , which govern electronic marketing , last year , up from 4,953 in 2010/11 , the @entity37 's annual report showed			1
if you receive a text from a company you know , or from an anonymous five digit short code , you can prevent any repeat by replying with the word ' stop '			0
if the text message is from an unknown company , or from an organisation you are not familiar with , the telecoms watchdog @entity46 recommends that you do not reply			0
responding will confirm that the number is active and might result in more messages , or even voice calls			1
instead , you should report the text to your network operator , which may be able to prevent further messages from the originating number			0
if the texts continue , complain to the @entity37 – http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints.aspx or 0303 123 1113			1
to stop unwanted sales calls , register your phone number – either landline or mobile – with the @entity158 on its website http://www.tpsonline.org.uk or 0845 070 0707			1
this service is free and takes some 28 days for the ban to come into effect			0
alternatively , some telephone companies offer services to block unwanted calls			1
for example , @entity198 offers ' privacy at home ' , ' choose to refuse ' and ' @entity202 ' .			0

the @entity204 is trying to bring an end to the *modern* plague of unwanted messages
@entity37 wants victims to contact them so they can fine those responsible for the stream of calls
