by @entity0 for @entity1 an adorable baby monkey rescued from animal traders selling it for cash has found a new family at a monkey sanctuary after being raised in a house			1
@entity9 , a vervet monkey , was only two weeks old when an anonymous woman saw him being sold on the street in @entity13 and gave him to wildlife worker @entity14			1
she then spent 24 hours a day with him and brought him up by hand in her home at the dr @entity17 in @entity13			2
@entity9 relaxing at the home of @entity14 after an anonymous woman rescued him from animal traders @entity14 visiting @entity9 at his new home at the animal sanctuary , where he moved to after she hand raised him at her flat but he 's now been returned to live with other monkeys at an animal sanctuary and will one day be returned to the wild			1
@entity9 was just two weeks old when ms @entity14 first met him			1
the woman , who had bought him from street traders in @entity31 in an attempt to rescue him , gave him to wildlife centre the @entity17 where ms @entity14 works			1
it 's not uncommon for mother monkeys in @entity13 to be killed so that their babies can be sold as pets			0
the @entity42 - @entity41 sanctuary worker became his adoptive mother , bottle - feeding him until he could eat fruit on his own and never letting him leave her side			1
while staying at dr @entity47 's house , whatever she did , @entity9 did too and he spent most of his time sitting on her shoulders while she cooked , cleaned and even went to the loo			0
ms @entity14 raised @entity9 ( pictured ) by hand at her flat at dr @entity47 's house in @entity13 monkey selfie : @entity9 pictured making a mess during meal times with his carer @entity14 just four months later though , she faced the trauma of giving away the baby monkey she had now come to think of as her own			1
when the moment arrived for @entity9 to rejoin other monkeys in the @entity63 sanctuary just south of @entity64 he was reluctant to leave his new mother 's arms			1
she had to spend four days helping him integrate into the troop of rescue animals			0
but now @entity9 is at home with the other monkeys and thriving in his natural habitat			2
@entity14 ( pictured ) said @entity9 was ' an amazing little guy ' and was happy to hand raise him ms @entity14 said : ' although it was heartbreaking to have to let @entity9 go i 'm happy for him and would do it again and again			1
' @entity9 was an amazing little guy			0
he made our lives so much better			0
every day i spent with @entity9 was the best day i had ever had			2
' he was cheeky and full of life and personality , but he was so soft and sometimes he would just be clinging to my shirt and staring up at me , and feel my face with his hands in such a loving way			0
' i am sure he 's not the last monkey i will save			0
' @entity9 is free and where he belongs back in the wild			1
' he is doing so well at the sanctuary that he is a perfect candidate for a full release into the wild which is so amazing and exactly what our goal is : less monkeys in cages and sanctuaries and more monkeys in the wild where they belong			2
' i could n't be happier with the outcome of @entity9 's story and hope it serves as a lesson to anyone who thinks a monkey is a pet			2
' they are not pets , they are not ours to keep			0
' there are thousands of @entity111 out there , and they all begin with a horror story			0
' the men kill the mother to get to the baby			0
the fear and horror that baby monkey must feel in those moments is unfathomable			0

@entity9 , a vervet monkey , was saved from animal traders on the streets
the anonymous rescuer then gave him to sanctuary worker @entity14
ms @entity14 proceeded to hand raise @entity9 at her flat for the next four months
he is now living with an adopted family of monkeys at a wildlife sanctuary
one day soon he will be released from the sanctuary back into the wild
