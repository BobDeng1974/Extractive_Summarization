from its adulterous beginnings to the final years of cold indifference , the relationship between @entity1 and @entity2 was one of the great love stories of the @entity7			1
now the story of their steamy passion – and its eventual demise – can be told in the great actor ’s own words , as a cache of previously unpublished letters is made available to the public for the first time			1
@entity1 wrote more than 200 letters to @entity20 star @entity2 over the course of their affair			1
it began in 1936 , when the two screen icons were both locked into their first marriages , and ended in their divorce in 1960			0
the following year , @entity1 married @entity29 , the actress who would remain his wife until he died in 1989			1
here @entity31 presents a revealing selection of @entity1 ’s correspondence , held in the archives of @entity36 ’s @entity35 and which curators are making available for the first time			1
their turbulent relationship ended in divorce in 1960 the ardent early years in the early years , when the infatuated @entity1 said he ‘ worshipped ’ @entity2 and likened life without her to ‘ purgatory ’ , he wrote candidly sexual declarations of his love			1
in one undated letter believed to be from 1938 or 1939 , he wrote : ‘ i woke up absolutely raging with desire for you my love ... oh dear @entity56 how i did want you			2
perhaps you were stroking your darling self			0
‘ oh dear sweet , i have n’t done anything			0
i ’ve often thought of it , but it is n’t that i want to satisfy myself so much because i would n’t do that without you , so i ’m not going to if i can help it			0
i know it wo n’t be right or do any good			0
' if we loved each other only with our bodies i suppose it would be alright			0
i love you with much more than that			0
i love you with , oh everything somehow , with a special kind of soul			0
’ on april 23 , 1939 , he wrote : ‘ i am sitting naked with just my parts wrapped in your panties			2
my longing for you is so intense			2
’ in a footnote , he added : ‘ i ’m loving and adoring and want you so			0
’ in an undated letter at about the same time he said : ‘ i do really love and worship you , my jewelkin			0
you are in my thoughts and weighing so heavily in my heart all the time			0
i am only existing until i see you again and only just managing to do that			0
’ @entity86 : the couple pictured at home in @entity36 in 1950			1
the couple married in 1940 , and were divorced in 1960			1
in the early years , the infatuated @entity1 said he ‘ worshipped ’ @entity2 and likened life without her to ‘ purgatory ' in another undated letter the actor told her that he longed for her embrace : ‘ i am in your arms and your are stroking and coddling me and i am doing little more than grunting and nuzzling ( except adoring and drawing all thought of life from you )			1
’ @entity1 was both relieved and excited when @entity2 landed the role of @entity101 in 1939 ’s @entity20			1
he wrote : ‘ the idea of you playing @entity101 is wonderful … in fact it ’s glorious and magnificent			2
[ i ’m ] sure no one can teach you anything about @entity101			0
’ but @entity1 ’s enthusiasm soon turned sour when @entity2 told him she was struggling with the role			1
both worried – needlessly as it turned out – that the film would flop and that its producer @entity113 would cancel plans to make @entity2 a huge star			2
on august 2 , 1939 , he wrote : ‘ my poor little precious you do sound unhappy			2
but the plain sense of it is – and this is very hard to hear – that not only have you got to be good in this if you can , and if you ca n’t you ’ve got at least to be good enough from @entity113 ’s angle to have your option taken up because you have got to justify yourself in the next two or three films by proving that the presumable failure of @entity124 was not your fault ... star - crossed lovers : the couple appeared on stage as @entity129 in 1940 , the same year that they married ‘ you have got to be damn smart to make a success of your career in pictures which is essential for your self - respect ... i am afraid you may become just boring			1
never to me ... but to yourself and because of that to others			0
’ @entity1 had to continually remind @entity2 that the scandalous nature of their relationship meant they could n’t be seen together in public , even when their affair became an open secret			1
on may 30 , 1939 , he wrote : ‘ i have come to the conclusion you ’re very naughty			2
we are a popular scandal , or rather a public one			0
therefore it is only reasonably good taste to be as unobtrusive as possible			0
can you dance and be gay and carry on like the gay happy hypocrite days ? no my love you can not			0
why because of your fame , tripled with our situation – quadrupled with the fame there off			0
’ @entity1 and @entity2 were finally free to marry in 1940 following their respective divorces			1
initially married life did nothing to dampen the couple ’s passion			1
in 1945 , @entity1 wrote : ‘ it is not possible to express my feelings and thoughts about you my dear one			1
i long for you with such a wretchedness			0
’ @entity2 responded in kind in letters sent during the 1950s			2
on august 1 , 1950 , while on a plane she wrote : ‘ oh sweet @entity171			2
if we were together i expect this would seem quite exciting , but then that applies to everything in life			0
’ later in the decade she wrote : ‘ whenever you think of me my @entity178 - boy you will know i am with you adoringly @entity2			1
’ the end of the affair yet while @entity2 never stopped loving @entity1 , by the late 50s the marriage was over in all but name			1
@entity2 suffered a serious of mental breakdowns and @entity1 tired of her extramarital affairs and erratic behaviour			1
the couple divorced in 1960			2
in a letter from the early 1960s , @entity1 wrote of how he was grateful for being ‘ set free ’ , and urged @entity2 to make a fresh start with her new love @entity189			1
‘ what horror it must have been for you and i want to say thank you for understanding it all for my sake ... you did nobly and bravely and beautifully and i am very oh so sorry , very sorry , that it must have been much hell for you , and i am very grateful to you for enduring it and setting me free to enjoy what is infinitely happy for me			0
oh @entity198 , how i do pray that you will find happiness now			0
’ fear : @entity2 ( left ) as @entity201 in the @entity203 - winning classic @entity20 - which she secretly feared would be considered a flop and ruin her burgeoning career in another letter he wrote : ‘ please do take great care of @entity189			1
he loves you and however saint - like do n’t try [ him ] too hard – he ’s a real man and he loves you wonderfully well – keep hold of that			2
’ he apologised to @entity2 when she learned from the media that he was to remarry			2
but he urged her to confine their relationship to the past			0
in happier times : the pair were globally renowned for their public displays of affection and their intense passion ‘ thank you so much for the most wonderful roses			1
i ca n’t pretend that viewing them did not distress me because such thoughts always do because you know @entity229 , do n’t you , that i ca n’t return them , those thoughts and mementos of romantic occasions			0
i am so dearly sorry about the beastly way you found out , [ but ] i do , as you know , want to get married – and the less we stir up about it the better for me and i ’m sure for you too			2
’ @entity2 did her best to remain a part of @entity1 ’s life but he was keen to keep his distance			1
in an undated letter written from @entity241 he said : ‘ please do not think i am being aloof			0
i have thought it all over very deeply and i am quite sure now that for all our sakes it would be much better for me to continue the plan i decided upon two years ago for us not to meet for the present			2
’ @entity1 ’s attitude meant @entity2 was desperate for every letter she received			1
on february 11 , 1963 she wrote : ‘ @entity250 , you can never know how very much your letter meant to me today			0
how really adorable of you to take time to write			0
’ in 1966 , @entity2 wrote to @entity29 after she had given birth to her third child with @entity1			1
in response @entity1 told @entity2 not to correspond with his wife again , saying : ‘ you must not i ’m afraid expect an answer			1
she is too desperately ill to think of turning her hand to letter writing ’ on may 28 , 1967 , @entity1 penned his last letter to @entity2 – five weeks before her death			1
it ended simply : ‘ @entity266 love darling , your @entity178			0
