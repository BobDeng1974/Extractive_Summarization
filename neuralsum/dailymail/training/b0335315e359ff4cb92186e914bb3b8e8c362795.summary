@entity0 admits that @entity1 must tighten up defensively when they face @entity2 on @entity3 in order to halt a run of poor away form stretching back over two months			1
the @entity1 have not won a @entity8 match away from home since beating @entity10 on october 26th and have picked up just a single point at @entity12 since then			1
@entity0 however , is refusing to compromise on the club 's tradition of entertaining possession football			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 looks on during his @entity1 's side 3 - 2 defeat away at @entity19 on sunday ' knowing what your philosophy is as a club is important and ours is one that i think fits very well , ' @entity0 said at his press conference ahead of the @entity2 clash			1
' it represents @entity1 from the @entity30 to the great years in the @entity31 , to winning titles in the @entity33 and as a team we want to control the ball and as a team we are great in possession but in any team you need to be able to defend			1
' at the moment we are suffering , sometimes through individual errors , sometimes you get three or four major decisions that do n't go in your favour and they go against you and you have to cope with that			0
' i think it 's going to make us a stronger unit and there 'll be a real fight to show who 's ready to cope with our expectations			2
' it 's a bit of a negative run of results at the moment and we need to stop it but there 's never a question mark over the style and how we want to play			1
@entity61 is expected to be out for five or six weeks with a calf injury for the @entity1 ' what 's a question mark is whether we 've been good in the way we want to play and at the moment we 've conceded too many goals for one reason or another and that 's quite easy to rectify , ' the @entity63 added			1
the festive period has not been kind to the @entity1 having lost their last three matches			1
coupled with a run of just one win in their last seven league games , @entity0 admits that as far as results go this has been his most challenging period at the helm since taking over from @entity81			1
however , he is keen to accentuate the positives in order to turn the team around going into 2015			0
' we 've become a stronger team than we were last season in many aspects in my eyes but we 've become a little bit more open and exposed in terms of conceding goals			0
' that 's come a little from individual errors but a little from bad luck as well but i think we need to get rid of that negative momentum that makes you a little bit exposed and conceding goals			0
' i do think that from where we were last campaign we 've improved as a team going forward , our goalscoring record in every game is outstanding			0
' @entity1 players look on despondently after conceding the only goal of the game against @entity108 ' before the @entity110 game we had the third best defensive record in the last six games in the league			2
the stats are very deceiving so you have to be careful			0
' obviously we conceded six goals against @entity117 which is going to affect any stat in the same manner we were also the only team to score three goals past @entity117			0
' at @entity1 i 'll always take responsibility but we 're not inferior to anyone and we 'll always go into any game trying to win the game			2
' what 's important is that we 're all fighting with real responsibility and understand what it means to be at @entity1 and we need to find the right way of playing to compete and get through periods like the one we 're experiencing now			1
' while @entity1 's away record is open to scrutiny , the home form of opponents @entity2 makes even worse reading			1
the @entity136 have won just once in the @entity8 at the @entity137 this season , against @entity139 in october , and have only one further home league win in the whole of 2014			2
@entity0 believes that both sides have struggled somewhat to meet the expectations placed on them by fans at the start of the season after exceeding targets in the last campaign , but , after a 1 - 1 draw in the reverse fixture at @entity144 , the @entity63 believes @entity2 still have the ability to cause his side a threat			1
@entity2 boss @entity154 - like @entity0 - could do with a morale - boosting win to start 2015 in positive vein ' they are suffering a little in terms of confidence , it happened a little bit to us			1
they 've started the season with huge expectations after reaching the @entity168 final , having a really strong competition in the @entity8			2
' they have a lot of new signings coming in but had a bit of an up and down season but they 'll be well organised and energetic and it 's going to be a well contested game and a difficult place to visit			0
' they been in all of the games they played and are always competitive			0
' ' they 're the first team we 'll have played twice this season and are a team that are very flexible tactically			0
' they have @entity185 forming a good partnership with @entity187 and they 've got players all over the park with big influence			0
' a big strength of the side is that whoever they have on the pitch knows what they have to do and they 're well structured			0
they have a fighting spirit and will always create chances			0
' @entity0 admits he and @entity154 could both do to sign off 2014 with a win			2
' it 's vital for both teams for no reason other than getting a positive result , ' he said .			0
