by @entity0 the rise of health - conscious female role models such as @entity4 , 31 , @entity5 , 34 , and @entity6 , 33 , has sparked a huge increase in the numbers of women working out multiple times per week			1
a survey of over 2,000 gym - goers people has shown a 62 per cent increase in the number of women working out over the last 12 months			1
while still an activity dominated by men , the proportion of women amongst this group of gym - goers rose significantly , from 9 per cent to 14.6 per cent			1
and as well as hitting the gym more often these women are increasingly using supplements , such as protein shakes , to maximise the effectiveness of their workout			2
dubbed the ‘ @entity41 ’ , these females are working out ( which incorporates exercise classes , gym sessions , running etc ) between four and five times a week and are typically in their mid twenties , with an average age of 24			1
unlike men , their main motivations are n't to build muscle , but to burn fat and get the toned and lean bodies typified by their favourite female stars			2
other motivators include the rise of celebrity - endorsed fitness supplements and the surge in popularity of so - called ‘ fitspiration ’ images on social media websites , with celebrities like @entity6 and @entity61 , 24 , regularly snapping themselves mid-workout in skimpy gym gear			1
unlike men , @entity41 like @entity64 are working out to burn fat and get toned and lean bodies the poll , which covered 2,312 fitness fans in total , revealed that the most popular supplements women take are whey - protein products such as protein shakes , on - the - go protein snacks and vitamin and mineral supplements			1
it also revealed that the biggest pull factor when it comes to selecting a brand is the product ’s taste and flavour			0
a spokesman for @entity86 , who conducted the survey , said of the study : ' the rise in women working out up to five times a week and complementing their work - outs and healthy eating regimes with protein supplements could well be down to the increase in celebrities posting results of their fitness regimes on social media and the rise of celebrities now spotted with protein shakes in their hands			1
inspired by stars posting pictures after every workout , @entity41 work out around five times a week ' the wide variety of new snack protein products such as protein coffee and muffins now available , means that getting much needed protein into an everyday diet is fun and even easier			2
i ’m thrilled that more women are getting active and enjoying the many benefits of exercise and healthy living			2
' @entity119 , head trainer and owner of @entity121 , says : ' the number of women who are immersing themselves fully into a health and fitness lifestyle is growing			0
mainly because of the greater awareness of the benefits of exercise and how it relates to everything from our social lives , food and fashion			0
' working out 5 times a week is fine			1
you just have to be very aware of your body to make sure you are not over doing it			0
' you have to make sure you are well rested , hydrated and on top of your nutrition			0
plan out your workouts so you are not doing the same things all week			0
' you can split your workouts into body parts , upper / lower body sessions , cardio / weight days or try different things between gym days like yoga , pilates , swim etc. ' supplements are fine you just have to be aware of what 's in it			2
we are seeing great results from @entity156 ( @entity158 burst ) which is a super food that is great source of digestible protein and contains all the essential amino acids as well as vitamin b6 and iron so is great as a post work out drink or tablet to aid in recovery			0
' i would stay away from diets and focus on a balanced nutrition plan , eating a minimum of three meals and two healthy snacks that include lean meats and fish and vegetables including complex carbohydrates			0
stay away from processed food and sugary drinks			0

there is a 62 % increase in women working out between 4 - 5 times a week
over half of female regular gym - goers now take protein supplements
the average age of these new ‘ @entity41 ’ is 24
