by @entity0 the scientific consensus on climate change , to the tune of 97 per cent of experts , is that humans are changing @entity7 ’s climate for the worse			1
but some people continue to insist that some of these scientists are wrong , incurring anger among those trying to teach people about the dangers of climate change			2
and one professor from @entity16 has had enough - he ’s decided to offer £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 ) to anyone that can prove to him that climate change is not man - made			1
dr @entity19 is offering £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 ) to anyone that can prove to him that man - made activities ( stock image shown ) are causing @entity7 's climate to drastically alter			1
he is not expecting to have to stump up any cash , though , as he is certain that the theory on which their is an overwhelming consensus is correct dr @entity19 , who previously taught at the @entity26 , says the climate change deniers of today are engaged in a campaign that is similar to the one waged by tobacco advocates to deny a link between smoking and lung cancer			1
dr @entity19 will award £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 ) of his own money to anyone that can prove , via the scientific method , that man - made global climate change is not occurring			1
there is no entry fee			0
you must be 18 years old or older to enter			0
entries do not have to be original , they only need to be first			2
dr @entity19 is the final judge of all entries but will provide his comments on why any entry fails to prove the point			1
previously he had been offering £ 5,850 ( $ 10,000 ) to the first person to prove climate changing was n’t man - made but he has since upped the reward to £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 )			1
all someone needs to do is show him evidence that unequivocally proves he is wrong on his blog			0
the challenge is open to anyone over 18 and there is no entry fee			0
' i will judge all entries and show why they fail or succeed in the challenge , ' dr @entity19 , also the author of @entity63 : dialogues on @entity65 , said			1
' entries do n’t even have to be original			2
they just have to be first			0
' he has been involved , at some level , with climate change for 30 years , having been a professor of physics for over 20 years and teaching at the @entity74 and the @entity75			1
dr @entity19 ( left ) has been involved with climate change for 30 years and previously was a professor of physics			1
' greenhouse gases are on the rise and the effects are evident : the earth is getting warmer , weather everywhere is changing , the oceans are warming at an alarming rate and ice caps are melting , ' he says ( right ) dr @entity19 says he is more than willing to pay the money but does n’t believe it will happen			1
' i ’m a scientist and i have to go where the science leads me			0
' i have been studying climate change for a long time and i am certain my money is safe			1
they are in the business of denial and deception , not science			0
' but , if someone could give me a scientific proof global warming is n’t real , it would be worth the money			0
' and he says there are ulterior motives to the climate deniers , mainly that they are funded by organisations with a vested interest in fossil fuels			2
‘ a recent study done at @entity111 showed that denier organisations have received nearly $ 560 million [ £ 330 million ] over an eight - year period , ’ he says			2
‘ they traced this money to about 140 different organisations , including many with ties to the fossil fuel industry			0
‘ these are the people that stand to lose money if we do something about climate change			2
‘ it simply shatters any credibility the deniers might have ever had			0
’ an analysis of global temperatures by @entity131 scientists showed that 2013 was the seventh warmest year since 1880 ( tied with 2006 and 2009 )			0
nine of the 10 warmest years on record all have occurred since 2000 , with 2010 and 2005 ranking as the warmest @entity19 says the results of climate change science are so overwhelming that the only way to deny global warming is to deny science itself			1
‘ greenhouse gases are on the rise and the effects are evident : the earth is getting warmer , weather everywhere is changing , the oceans are warming at an alarming rate and ice caps are melting			0
‘ every where you look you see evidence of global warming			0
this is n’t something that is only going to occur in the future , it is happening right now			0
' if someone can prove him otherwise , though , he is willing to change his tune - but at the moment he does n't see that as being very likely .			2

@entity16 - based professor has *issued* a challenge to climate change deniers
dr @entity19 is offering £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 ) to anyone that can *disprove* the theory that human activity is warming the *planet*
he is so sure of his claim that he is not expecting to pay out any time soon
anyone can enter the *competition* and the work does n't need to be original
but dr @entity19 says he will be the final judge on winning or losing entries
