almost 20,000 families may be hit with the financial burden of laying to rest their loved ones after people signed up to unprofitable funeral plans immediately after @entity5 @entity6 lost his mother @entity7 to @entity8 two years ago and has been locked in a legal battle with a funeral company ever since after he was told he owed $ 7,195 despite ms @entity7 setting up her own pre-paid plans in 1948 when she was just 16			1
the court decision over who must pay the money will be handed down on thursday which could have serious ramifications for about 19,500 other @entity16 signed up to the same funeral plan			1
@entity6 said his mother would be ' mortified ' by the situation after paying small contributions over 32 years for a funeral service so her family would not have to suffer the financial burden			1
' it was after the war , they had seen a lot of people who did not have access to a proper send - off so i think they were very mindful that you should put things in place , ' he told 7.30			0
@entity6 and his wife @entity20 approached @entity21 with the paid certificate his mother had received when she made her last payment in 1980 and were told her money had been put in a @entity26 trust which was now only worth $ 390			1
@entity20 said the company told them would be discounted that amount but would be required to pay the rest			0
' all of this happens at a time when you 're at your most emotionally distraught , straight after you 've lost someone , ' she said			0
ms @entity7 with her son @entity6 - who said his mother would be mortified with the legal battle ms @entity7 paid Â£ 25 in small contributions over 32 years for a funeral service more than $ 5 million worth of funeral plan payments are believed to be sitting in the @entity26 trust , 7.30 reported			1
@entity6 said he hoped the court decision would go in their favour to provide closure on the distressing experience and set a precedent for other families in the same situation			2
' it 's hard , in all honesty , to put mum to rest when you think this court case and all the legal comings and goings are still very much in play , ' he told 7.30			0
' if i can stop one or two more families in @entity81 from having to deal with this , then i feel that us bringing it to light has been a very decent outcome			0
' ' it could mean the difference between whether they can lay their loved ones to rest with peace of mind or whether they are going to have to incur expenses they have n't planned for , ' the @entity7 's lawyer , @entity87 , said			0
after @entity7 's last payment in 1980 she received a fully paid certificate			2
