@entity0 said the new @entity2 single was inspired by the tragic story of a nurse who died of ebola after wiping away a child 's tear if @entity0 harboured any doubts about reprising his world - famous @entity2 song , they were extinguished by a single heartbreaking image from @entity13			1
the @entity14 can reveal that he was spurred to mobilise today ’s pop stars after seeing a brave nurse wipe away a tear from the cheek of a child dying of ebola			1
‘ the nurse forgot where she was , and what was happening , and wiped a tear from the child , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the child died and the nurse died			2
you ca n’t get more tragic than that			0
’ after this , @entity0 – once disinclined to revisit do they know it ’s @entity33 after 30 years – was now utterly convinced of the need for a new version of the song			1
and so yesterday , in the footsteps of @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and others , whose 1984 efforts raised money for famine relief in @entity50 , stars such as @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 gathered in a @entity52 recording studio for @entity2 30			1
speaking to @entity14 on the eve of the recording , @entity0 described ebola as pernicious and ‘ anti-human ’ , rendering people ‘ incapable of touching ’			1
he added : ‘ you have a five - year - old daughter in agony who is not even allowed to be comforted by her mother			0
’ fixed in his mind , as he rewrote some of the lyrics to the song with producer @entity66 , was the image of the nurse wiping away the child ’s tear			1
now the line ‘ where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears ’ is replaced with ‘ where a kiss of love can kill you and there ’s death in every tear ’			1
yesterday ’s recording received a boost with news that the government will waive vat on the charity single			2
back in 1984 , @entity0 had to twist then prime minister @entity87 ’s arm to agree to this , but chancellor @entity89 did n’t need convincing yesterday			2
‘ amazing that the government has just said , “ @entity91 , keep the tax , ’ said sir @entity0 after speaking to mr @entity89			1
‘ the nurse forgot where she was , and what was happening , and wiped a tear from the child , ’ said sir @entity0			1
‘ the child died and the nurse died			2
you ca n’t get more tragic than that ’ we are family : producer @entity66 prepares to head into the studio in @entity105 with his daughters , from left , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 @entity0 was joined at the recording studio by his two daughters @entity115 ( left ) and @entity116 ‘ the next stage now is to turn this into a phenomenon like it was in the 1980s , and the only way to do that is to get people to buy the thing			1
’ yesterday , just as their predecessors had done 30 years ago , the artists , bleary - eyed , started to arrive for the recording from 6.45am			1
they included @entity127 , @entity129 ’s @entity128 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and electronic band @entity137			0
@entity138 was the only artist taking part who sang on the original single			0
he arrived late and blamed airport fog			0
‘ i ’d be happy just to stand in the background and wave , ’ he quipped			2
organisers hope the track will be completed in time for its first public performance during tonight ’s edition of @entity150			0
sir @entity0 said : ‘ it really does n’t matter if you do n’t like this song			1
it really does n’t matter if you do n’t like the artists , it really does n’t matter if it turns out to be a lousy recording – what you have to do is buy this thing			2
’ stars and stripes : blonde singer @entity135 turns up in biker boots – and matching bag and jumper – for the recording session , also attended by @entity138 ( right ) where 's @entity166 ? excitement builds as fans who turned up early await the arrival of heart throbs one direction he arrived with daughters @entity116 , 24 , and 31 - year - old @entity115 , who can be seen in the original video as a baby			2
@entity66 posed for pictures with his four daughters , none of whom were born at the time of the first recording			0
singer @entity183 said during a break in the recording : ‘ @entity0 called me personally and talked through the severity of the ebola problem			1
‘ and he gave a really touching speech beforehand which really got everyone in to the right frame of mind … he was saying we should n’t see it as them and us because tomorrow it could be us all suffering			0
‘ it certainly made everyone sing with a bit more passion			0
it took a while to get the harmonies right but it was sounding great			0
it took about five takes			0
’ @entity201 stare : @entity129 frontman @entity128 seems to consciously uncouple from the task in hand to glance at the camera lady in red : @entity39 in a billowing trouser suit and midrift - revealing crop top , waves to fans , while a bleary - eyed @entity212 is one of the first to appear from the session at around 6.45am she added : ‘ @entity138 said it will be your hairstyle you remember in 30 years and regret			0
’ for @entity38 heart - throb @entity212 , it was the second big charity performance in a matter of hours – the 20 - year - old performed during the @entity223 extravaganza on friday night			0
the band had the privilege of singing the first line			0
despite the early hour , dozens of fans were there to greet him			0
some of the stars could barely contain their excitement and provided regular updates on social media			0
@entity150 finalist and chart - topper @entity131 tweeted : ‘ been hanging out with this lad @entity212 ’ , and added : ‘ plus with these legends @entity138 , @entity128 and sir @entity0			1
’ a spokeswoman said every penny raised from the sale of the download , cd and app will go to the ‘ fight against ebola ’ .			2
