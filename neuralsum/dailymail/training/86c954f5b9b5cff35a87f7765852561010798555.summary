@entity0 urged @entity1 to show greater consistency with their wing selections after advancing his own case for a recall with two more tries on saturday			2
the 31 - year - old demonstrated his finishing class as @entity10 claimed a stirring 30 - 23 victory over @entity12 in @entity13 of the @entity14 at @entity15			2
despite his latest feat , @entity0 is unlikely to feature in the @entity1 squad named on wednesday and he expressed concerns about the selection policy out wide			2
@entity10 winger @entity0 crossed for two tries as his side prevailed 30 - 23 over @entity12 @entity22 also registered a brace of tries as he looks to cement a spot in @entity27 's squad ' so many wings come and go with @entity1 because @entity30 rugby is a bigger game			1
you have to have more of an all - round game , ' he said			0
' the sad thing is you get young lads who come in and score tries for their clubs , get put in at the highest level and get exposed then people just get rid of them			0
' they 've shown some natural talent in being a good finisher , so teach them the game and stick with them			0
that does n't seem to happen on the wing			0
' if they 're scoring tries in the @entity52 and not scoring for @entity1 — but they go back to the @entity52 and keep scoring tries — maybe it 's because they 're not getting the same ball			2
explosive @entity57 winger @entity56 has been tipped to win his first @entity1 cap in november ' lads are usually blooded a lot younger on the wing and there needs to be more onus on sticking with them and teaching them a bigger skill base			1
' i 'm one of the best wings in @entity1 and have been playing consistently at this level for a number of seasons			0
@entity27 ( @entity72 ) has done the right thing			0
he 's had a look at the wings out there and i hope that leading up to the @entity77 he 'll pick the best ones			0
' @entity22 also scored two tries in @entity10 ' win and is destined to be included in the @entity1 squad , along with @entity82 and one or both of the @entity57 pair , @entity85 and @entity56			1
@entity86 of @entity87 and @entity89 ' @entity88 are also in the mix. in saturday 's other @entity13 match , @entity91 stormed into a 23 - 7 half - time lead at home to @entity95 , but the visitors rallied with two tries after half - time and snatched a 27 - 26 win courtesy of @entity101 's injury - time drop goal			1
@entity102 was in superb form for the @entity104 as the @entity106 region cruised a 42 - 7 victory against @entity108 @entity109 star @entity102 wants the @entity104 to travel ' full of confidence ' when they tackle @entity112 champions @entity111 at @entity113 next saturday			1
fly - half @entity102 kicked 17 points and ran the show as @entity104 opened their @entity14 campaign in emphatic fashion by posting a 42 - 7 bonus - point victory over outclassed @entity108 at the @entity120			1
it meant the unbeaten @entity123 leaders took early charge of @entity125 , teeing up the @entity127 clash after clinching a seventh successive win in all competitions			0
@entity104 centre @entity130 makes a break through the @entity108 defence at the @entity120 @entity102 said : ' we realise how difficult a place it is going to be to play at next week , but also we should go up there with confidence			2
why not ? ' we are unbeaten this season at the minute			0
we are under no illusions that there is loads to work on , but why not go up there full of confidence and give it a good go ? ' @entity111 lock @entity147 rises high to claim a lineout but his side went down 20 - 11 in @entity150 @entity111 endured an agonising end to their @entity125 match against @entity153 in @entity150			1
with time almost up , @entity154 had a kick charged down on his 22 by @entity156 , who ran on to score			0
@entity157 added the extras to deny @entity127 a losing bonus point in a 20 - 11 victory			1
@entity153 scrum - half @entity161 fires out a pass during his team 's victory over the @entity127 @entity57 's return to @entity168 's top table began in disastrous fashion as they were crushed 37 - 10 by @entity170 at @entity171 — conceding five tries			1
the visitors also lost @entity174 to injury to cap a bad week for after they missed out on signing @entity176			0
@entity170 scrum - half @entity177 dives over for his side 's fourth try in the 37 - 10 victory over @entity57			1
