by @entity1 reporter published : 11:22 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 02:54 est , 20 november 2012 a @entity3 man is facing five years in prison and up to $ 10,000 fine for animal cruelty after allegedly beating a four - month old @entity6 so severely that the puppy was dead just one day after he adopted her @entity9 , a high - frequency trader , adopted the puppy , @entity12 , from a @entity14 breeder @entity13 , who call their dogs ' friendly and loveable , with tail perpetually wagging ! ' but just one day after getting his new best friend , @entity9 had allegedly whipped @entity12 with a leash , slammed her against hard surfaces , and drug her across parking lots until she was bleeding			1
puppy : @entity12 the @entity6 was only four months old when she was sent to @entity9 last year			1
she was dead after just one day @entity25 records show @entity9 picked up @entity12 at 3:14 p.m. on nov. 11 , 2011			1
inside the box there was a note from the breeder : ' i hope that she brings as much joy to you and your family as our dogs have brought us			0
i wish her a long life of happiness and contentment			0
' he later told police that he did n't care for her coat and considered returning ' it ' but that he instead took her to the apartment he shared with his boyfriend and another beagle , @entity47			0
he put an electric - shock collar and leash on the new puppy the next day and began to walk her through the building 's parking lot			1
@entity53 , a valet parker in the building , told police he he heard a ' loud scream from a dog ' just as he was bringing a car from the garage			2
at first he thought he 'd hit an animal and jumped out of the vehicle			0
@entity64 : @entity65 describes their dogs as friendly , easygoing , and constantly wagging their tails then he saw @entity9 , ' striking his dog with leash			1
' @entity9 was arrested in november 2011			1
he told police the dog likely died from injuries sustained when he dropped her in the shower			2
' i do n't think i did anything wrong , other than the outcome was very poor because of the way the dog landed , ' he told investigators			2
' this was 100 percent an accident			0
' @entity9 's lawyer , @entity84 , told the @entity85 that ' there are some things that have not come to light yet			1
' ' you ca n't dispute there are injuries , ' he said			0
' how they occurred , whether or not it was a criminal act , is the question			0
' @entity95 is an expert in high - profile animal abuse cases , having represented 19 - year - old @entity97 when the teen was accused of killing 19 cats in @entity100 in 2009			0
prosecutors dropped the charges in that case after a defense expert determined that a large animal killed some of the cats , and @entity97 is now suing several parties involved in the case			0
discipline : @entity111 claims he as only trying to discipline his new @entity6 because dogs would n't become obedient with ' rainbows and sugarplums ' @entity9 denied the charges , claiming he was only trying to train the dog and following the instructions for the shock - collar manual			1
' dogs do n't become extremely obedient with rainbows and sugarplums , ' he said , admitting that it may have appeared ' abusive ' to onlookers who did n't know what he was doing , and that he 'd been trying to train @entity12 in a ' very aggressive ' way			2
@entity65 disagrees , noting on their website under training information that for @entity12 's particular breed : ' praise is the key , as they thrive on positive attention			1
' @entity9 told investigators he wanted to clean @entity12 after he noticed one of her paws was bleeding			1
' when i went to put the dog underneath the shower head , it did n't like that at all and it bit me , ' he said			1
' i was very shocked			0
i do n't like blood			0
when the dog bit me , a lot of blood came out and i overreacted to the dog doing this			1
' exactly how he reacted is unclear			0
in one interview with investigators he describe it as having ' pushed ' the dog in the shower , but in another he said he 'd told the @entity154 veterinarian that ' the way i threw the dog was definitely bad			2
' @entity9 said he attempted to give the @entity12 first aid once she was on the shower floor			1
' from there it was , i guess you can call it , unconscious , so i gave it @entity166 , ' he said			0
' i tried to stand the dog up			2
i blew in the dog			2
i covered its beak [ sic ] , the dog ’s belly puffed up			2
i thought it was going to blow up , then it s ---			0
' finally after calling a friend who advised him to take her to the vet , @entity9 brought @entity12 to the @entity154			1
there dr. @entity175 tried to stabilize @entity12 and keep her ' alive and comfortable , ’ according to her police statement			0
because the @entity154 x-ray machine was broken @entity9 was directed to a clinic in @entity179			1
he put @entity12 in a pet carrier , belted it into the passenger seat of his @entity183 and left			0
loveable : though @entity9 claimed he had to be rough with @entity12 to train her , the breeder 's website said beagles respond be to positive reinforcement mystery : @entity9 's attorney @entity84 argues that all the facts in the case have n't come out , and that @entity12 's injuries were not the product of abuse @entity175 told police that when she last saw @entity197 the dog was unconscious but her heartbeat was strong and steady			1
' 20 minutes late i got a call [ from @entity9 ] that the dog 's heart had stopped beating in the car , ' @entity175 told police			1
' i found it odd just due to the face that [ @entity12 's ] heart rate was so fast and strong and the vitals were fine			2
' @entity9 came back with @entity12 's corpse			1
@entity175 put it in the freezer			0
the next day @entity212 called the police			0
dr. @entity214 , a veterinary pathologist and adjunct professor at @entity216 , was recruited by @entity217 to perform a necropsy			0
she concluded death was ' likely due to a brain injury secondary to head trauma			1
' @entity12 's injuries pointed to having been shaken and slammed against a hard surface , and their was bruising around her mouth , indicating that she may have been smothered			2
accusations are already being made that @entity9 may have abused other animals			2
@entity227 , assistant property manager in @entity9 's apartment building , said that a month before @entity12 's death she saw his dog @entity47 shaking			1
' i went closer and noticed hemorrhaging in her eyes , ' she said			0
to me that 's a bad sign			2
' animal services has since confiscated @entity47 and returned her to her registered owner , @entity9 's ex-boyfriend , who has not been named in police reports			1
@entity227 said she sent @entity9 a text message one day after @entity12 's death			1
' it think there 's more to this story , ' she wrote			0
' do you think i 'd kill a dog i just paid $ 1,300 for ? ' he allegedly responded			0
' i would have sold it			0

*neighbors* claim @entity9 dragged the puppy across the parking lot until it was bleeding
@entity251 said dog 's death after leaving her office with a steady heartbeat was *suspicious*
testing shows bruises *consistent* with smothering and head trauma
@entity261 said he was just training the dog to be obedient
