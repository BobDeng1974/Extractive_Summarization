burned , in pain , and close to death : that is how @entity4 the black bear was discovered in the aftermath of the largest forest fire ever to rip through @entity7 last year			1
trapped among the flames she had somehow managed to survive , but had suffered third degree burns to all four of her paws that meant she was reduced to crawling along on her elbows			1
but now thanks to the efforts of staff at @entity16 she is getting ready to be released back into the wild after making a full recovery			1
but now she is almost ready to be released back into the wild in july 2014 three separate forest fires all caused by lightening strikes converged in the @entity35 area of @entity7 , reducing more than 250,000 acres of forest to ashes			1
the flames burned for more than a week , creating the biggest forest fire the state had ever seen , taking more than 3,000 fire fighters to bring it under control			1
care : staff at the centre are specialists in treating bears less than one year old			0
@entity4 was aged just nine months when she was brought in an estimated 300 houses were burned to the ground around @entity49 and @entity50 , and it was here that a homeowner discovered @entity4 after returning to inspect the ruins of their property			1
the 18 - month - old cub was severely injured , badly underweight , and in so much pain she could n't stand up			0
left on her own , she would have died a slow , painful and inevitable death			0
but instead rescue workers used a sedative to knock her out , before flying her more than more than 800 miles to @entity23 in neighbouring @entity63			1
once there specialist staff at the @entity16 began working on nursing her back to full health			1
@entity67 , the secretary of @entity16 , said : ' fortunately , when @entity4 came to us in august everything came together			1
' dr @entity70 – our voluntary veterinarian – took over as he has over 30 years ' experience of dealing with our major medical emergencies			0
' @entity4 was already a wild bear which meant we did n't have to do too much rehabilitation			1
it was all about the medical care for her			0
' from the day she came in we had her set up on an every other day treatment where we changed the dressings on her wounds			2
' for over six weeks we changed the dressings every other day and then we increased the time between them			0
' from september 30 we stopped putting dressings on her feet to let them heal on their own			0
' after her wounds had healed she was transferred to the @entity85 in @entity86 , where she is now going through the last phase of her healing process before going back to nature			2
she has been placed next to another one year old cub to get her used to other bears and is spending time outside to get her paws used to the cold weather			2
on the mend : @entity4 has now put on weight , regrown her scorched fur , and had almost all of the bandages removed from her feet , and is getting ready to be returned to the wild alone : it is believed that @entity102 ' mother died in the forest fire , so she has been placed with other bears at a rescue centre to get her used to their company before she is released mr @entity67 added : ' our normal procedure means we knock out the bear to make it easier for her to move them			1
she was out within a few minutes and then we put her on a stretcher to weigh her			0
' her weight tripled in the time we looked after her from 39lbs - which is really light for a second year cub			0
we weighed her the other day she was 97lbs with a really fat stomach which is good for her			0
' we 're really pleased with the progress she has made			0
she was a perfect lady on the trip – she barely made a sound on the drive			0
' @entity126 will normally sleep for that long , but she kept herself busy with a toy and she had her favourite grapes to feed on			0
treatment : staff at @entity16 dress @entity102 ' wounds as they nurse her back to health recovery : after being treated in @entity23 , @entity102 was moved to the @entity85 where she is currently waiting to be released back into the @entity7 wild ' once we got to @entity86 it took her a matter of seconds to pop her head out and explore her new surrounds			1
we 're so happy with the way she 's healed			2
' @entity67 and his wife @entity144 set up @entity16 in 1978 after attending a wildlife seminar and have helped heal more than 20,000 animals in their 36 year history			2
the animal charity is the only certified wildlife centre to rehabilitate bear cubs under one year in the state of @entity63 .			2
