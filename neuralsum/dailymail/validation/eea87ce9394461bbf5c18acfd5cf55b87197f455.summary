@entity0 has released his first video message since nearly three dozen women accused him of sexual assault and has insisted : ' i 'm far from finished			1
' in the 10 - second video , which @entity7 showed on monday morning , the embattled comedian can be seen speaking on the phone as he encourages someone to come to one of his shows			1
' you know i 'll be hilarious , ' he says in the clip , in which he wears his pajamas			1
' he also released a short message accompanying the video			2
' @entity19 , i hope you enjoy my wonderful video message that 's filled with @entity23 , ' he said in the statement , shared by @entity7			2
' @entity25 , i 'm far from finished			2
he made no direct reference to the accusations or the scores of women making them , but the 77 - year - old comedian has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing			1
it comes as @entity0 continues to tour the @entity42 with his stand - up comedy show			1
his next appearances are in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , @entity48 this weekend			0
although the shows have continued to attract fans , they have also garnered protesters			0
among the demonstrations , 100 people stood outside a @entity56 theater in january shouting : ' rape is no joke ! ' @entity0 has also canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances amid the allegations , many of which exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution			1
just last week , @entity66 joined the 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the @entity71 star to say she had also been assaulted by him			2
she says the beloved actor pressured her into performing a sexual act on him when she was a 17 - year - old aspiring model in 1988			0
she had met him through her @entity78 modeling agency			0
when ms @entity66 's story was originally revealed in november 2014 , @entity0 's lawyer @entity79 called it ' absurd ' to publish an ' unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person '			1
promotion : @entity0 , pictured on stage in @entity86 last november , promoted his live shows in the video speaking out : last week , @entity89 , pictured left with @entity0 and right today , wrote in an op - ed for the @entity91 how she felt pressure as an @entity93 not to tell anyone about the abuse and in an op - ed published on friday , former model @entity96 detailed how @entity0 invited her to dinner and slipped something into her wine , before grabbing her hand and putting it on his genitals			1
as an @entity93 - @entity93 woman she said she felt pressure not to speak out , she said			0
' telling my story would n't only help bring down @entity0 ; i feared it would undermine the entire @entity93 community , ' she wrote			0
last month , @entity0 's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 - accusing him of sexual offenses			1
@entity112 , a 56 - year - old @entity116 lawyer , says @entity0 drugged and sexually assaulted her in her @entity118 - area apartment in the early 1970s			1
@entity113 says @entity0 drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in @entity121 around 1976 , while @entity114 alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a @entity116 beach in about 1970			1
the former star of @entity71 has n't been charged with any crime			0
in their defamation lawsuit , the accusers , all of whom have stepped forward in recent years to detail the alleged abuse , said @entity0 's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence			2
support : @entity0 's wife @entity135 , pictured in november , is standing by her man amid the multiple accusations but @entity0 's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self - defense as his character was under attack			1
' the law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked , ' the lawyers argued in their 38 - page filing			0
' instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims			0
' @entity150 , a lawyer for the three accusers , said his clients disagree with that position			0
' we believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual , it must be truthful , ' he said			0
' we look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful			0
' lawyers for the three accusers have until march 20 to file a reply to @entity0 's motion to dismiss the suit .			2
