two or three lifetimes ago , the satirists @entity0 and @entity2 performed a sketch which mocked the military mindset			2
@entity0 , as the @entity6 , addressed ‘ @entity7 ’ , played by @entity2 : ‘ i want you to lay down your life , @entity10			2
we need a futile gesture at this stage			1
it ’ll raise the whole tone of the war			1
get up in a crate , @entity10			2
@entity19 , i wish i was going too			2
’ @entity2 : ‘ goodbye , sir — or is it au revoir ? @entity0 : ‘ no , @entity10			2
@entity38 have just endured a disastrously truncated @entity34 so a facile , totally futile gesture is demanded			1
@entity32 must go ! sack the manager			1
why , it ’ll appease the rabble and raise the tone			1
now i realise that there are armies of armchair generals who could have done an infinitely better job than the current @entity38 manager			1
true , they may never have been required to pick a team or command the professional respect of a diverse group of young millionaires			2
no matter , given the time and the facilities , any one of those amateurs could have created a team capable of beating the world			1
and if they could n’t , then they know a man who could			2
but @entity32 failed to land a trophy which @entity38 won as recently as 1966 , so @entity32 must go			1
yet who should replace him ? who would be guaranteed to do a better job with the players available ? who , in short , would be capable of satisfying @entity38 ’s absurdly inflated expectations ? after all , the alternatives to @entity32 are not queuing around the block			1
and the field is narrowed still further by the @entity26 ’s apparent insistence that the manager of @entity38 should be @entity76			1
so who does that leave us with ? @entity80 ? — not really			2
@entity81 ? — not a hope			2
@entity83 — do n’t be silly			2
but wait ! who is that standing offstage , frantically demanding attention ? why , it ’s @entity87 ; the renowned sage , raconteur and media darling with a quote for all occasions			1
@entity87 has made no secret of his conviction that he should have had the @entity38 job			1
you will recall his sneer at @entity32 : ‘ sometimes one face fits and another does n’t			1
simple as that ... i think we can all see that he is more of an @entity26 man ... he ticks the @entity26 ’s boxes as @entity38 manager just fine			1
’ the envy was too blatant , the derision too crude			2
revelations : @entity87 made assertions about unnamed @entity110 players who wanted to shirk international duty he also claimed that several @entity38 players , including @entity113 , had sent him texts saying they would love him to manage @entity38			1
@entity113 denied it , crushingly			0
‘ i ’ve never had his personal number , ’ he said			0
yet the old chap is not easily discouraged and he was at it again last week , choosing a moment when @entity32 was at his lowest ebb to impugn the loyalty of @entity38 footballers			1
‘ i can tell you , when i was at @entity110 when full internationals came around , there were two or three players who did not want to play for @entity38 , ’ he said			1
‘ they would come to me 10 days before the game and say , “ @entity130 , get me out of that game , i do n’t want to play in that game ”			0
i ’d say , “ you ’re playing for your country , you should want to play ”			0
and that is the truth , so it makes you wonder			0
’ once again @entity113 , who is the wrong man to upset , came down on him like a ton of bricks			0
‘ i ’d be interested to find out who those players are , ’ said the @entity38 captain			1
‘ if @entity87 is making a comment like that , he should name them and embarrass them ... no one has said to me they do n’t like playing for @entity38 or that they do n’t want to be here			1
they did n’t want to play for @entity38			1
’ straight talking : @entity113 asked for names to be named needless to say , @entity87 retreated in unseemly haste : ‘ i do n’t want to get into naming names because it would n’t be fair to the players , ’ he babbled			0
the fact that he had smeared the dozen @entity38 players who worked under him at @entity110 was apparently irrelevant			1
such is the kind of malevolent nonsense which @entity32 has to endure , and while sympathy is too much to expect , a certain understanding might be in order			1
for a talented man of substantial achievement is now lazily reduced to a designated whipping boy ; a national pin - cushion			0
truly , there are times when the futile gesture seems not so much a punishment , more a merciful option			1
when the outrage and uproar subsided , all were agreed that the fangs of @entity177 had provided the most compelling image of this @entity34 so far			1
and the delicious reactions to his assault only added spice to the story			0
@entity184 opted for blank denial			0
‘ i did n’t see him bite anyone , ’ said president @entity186			0
the national captain , @entity189 , was equally brazen			0
‘ what incident ? ’ he asked			0
‘ i do n’t know what incident you ’re talking about			0
have you got something against @entity177 ? ’ they were supported by the philosopher @entity195 , who twittered : ‘ he ’s a winner			1
if that means he occasionally steps over the line between right and wrong , than that ’s what comes with the territory			1
’ daddy fool : @entity177 is back at home with his children after his @entity34 disgrace i suspect our @entity211 ’s attempts to be taken seriously have not been advanced by that little effort.in the opposing camp , @entity208 offered a radical remedy			1
sounding that note of cool reason , which has made him such an invaluable member of @entity220 ’s estimable commission , he announced : ‘ they have got to throw him in jail and lock him up for ever			1
’ that ’ll teach him			1
but the cruellest cut was inflicted by the online betting firm 888poker , for whom @entity177 was an ‘ official worldwide ambassador ’			0
first , they declared : ‘ we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour			0
’ then , following the @entity232 ban , the company announced , more in sorrow than in anger : ‘ 888poker has decided to terminate its relationship with @entity177 with immediate effect			0
’ so it ’s official : @entity177 has become too tacky , even for a bunch of online gamblers			1
i fear there can be no way back			0
shame : @entity247 sponsor @entity246 @entity247 , the notorious payday lender , has been ordered to pay £ 2.6million in compensation after sending threatening letters from fictitious law firms to customers in arrears			0
not only were the firms invented but in some cases @entity247 actually charged the customers fees for the fraudulent letters			0
the intention was to pressurise people in arrears by making them believe their debt had been passed on to a law firm , who threatened legal action if the debt was not paid			0
@entity266 , of the @entity267 , said : ‘ @entity247 ’s misconduct was very serious as it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation for customers in arrears			2
’ @entity274 , executive director of the consumer magazine which ? , described it as ‘ a shocking new low for the payday industry ’			0
meanwhile , @entity246 ’s famous black and white stripes are still contaminated by the @entity247 name as they continue their four - year , £ 32m sponsorship			2
the reason for @entity247 ’s targeting of @entity246 is as obvious as it is cynical ; the @entity285 has the highest rate of personal insolvency in the country and the area contains a disproportionate number of the poor , the vulnerable and the desperate			2
@entity291 , the local mp , summed it up			0
‘ some of the richest young men in @entity246 are wearing shirts calling on the poorest to go to a legal loan shark , ’ she said			0
but will this latest evidence produce a change of mind ? will a wealthy club discover a conscience , forego the tarnished money and restore a measure of decent dignity to the grand old shirt ? i suspect we know the answer			0
the rumours are so strong , they may even be true : @entity310 are attempting to sign @entity177			0
apparently unconcerned by his four - month ban and his appalling reputation , they are preparing to take him to the @entity314			0
@entity310 represents just about everything that is good in the game , from their insistence on playing the purest form of football , to their treatment of the fans , to their deep respect for their own traditions			0
now they are dallying with a serial biter			0
we thought they were better than that			0
let ’s hope we were right .			2

@entity38 have just endured a disastrously truncated @entity34 so a facile , totally futile gesture is demanded
@entity32 must go ! sack the manager . why , it ’ll appease the rabble and raise the tone
yet who should replace him ? who , in short , would be capable of satisfying @entity38 ’s absurdly inflated expectations ?
