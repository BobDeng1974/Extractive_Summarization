perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to @entity1 is that this cauldron of noise , which at kick - off seemed so threatening , was reduced to a quiet hum after the 50th minute			1
that was the moment when @entity7 reminded us why @entity9 paid £ 86million for his signature , why the caustic treatment of his recent performances in @entity13 seems so odd			1
having drawn a foul from @entity15 inches outside the box with his pace , he dispatched the ball into the net as simply as if from the penalty spot in any			0
his shot curled over the wall with surgical placement , leaving goalkeeper @entity25 stock still			0

it was route one stuff			0
@entity62 pumped the ball long and @entity28 allowed it to bounce			2
@entity7 stole above @entity15 to nod into the path of @entity68 , who delivered a brilliant header over @entity25			1

@entity7 dedicated the win to much - loved kitman @entity65 , who passed away last month with the players wearing black armbands			1
by the end , @entity1 were running through 10 - man @entity28 at will , @entity15 having been sent off for a second booking shortly after 2 - 0 for fouling @entity7 again			1
substitute @entity132 , making his first international appearance in a year following serious injury , nearly scored , as @entity7 twice went close to getting his hat - trick			1
their 3 - 0 win over @entity139 here in november and perfect record prior to this game , is indication of that			0

the noise for the @entity28 national anthem as thousands held up @entity199 flags told you that			2
the whistles greeting early touches by @entity1 players were piercing in the extreme			2
@entity7 ’s name over the tannoy drew louder cat calls than any			2
‘ haters gon na hate , ’ read a sign in the away section , directed more towards @entity9 ’s critical following than those here in @entity29			0

a poster of ‘ @entity217 ’ could be seen behind one goal			0
little battles all over the pitch showed the tension			0
an early shove by @entity67 on @entity48 as the pair tussled for a throw in drew high - pitched screeching from the stands			0
@entity64 suggested @entity61 might ‘ f * * * off ’ when the @entity28 manager appealed for a card after @entity229 dramatically rolled on the turf following a collision for a high ball			2

as the seconds ticked on the disapproving clamour from the home fans grew unbearable almost			0
@entity70 had a shot blocked , @entity68 a corner cleared and then @entity7 delivered a wonderful cross to an unmarked @entity261 at the back stick			1
unfortunately it was @entity64 , who stood on the ball from two yards out rather than apply the finishing touch that had seemed certain			0
the pause allowed @entity28 to clear			0
in the end , as @entity1 fans sung ‘ we are top of the league ’ , it was a mere footnote @entity7 ( left ) is sent tumbling to the ground after a challenge from @entity28 midfield player @entity54 the @entity1 squad have a huddle before the start of their @entity36 @entity278 qualifier in @entity29 against @entity28 the @entity1 team were backed by a vociferous following for the encounter in @entity29			1
