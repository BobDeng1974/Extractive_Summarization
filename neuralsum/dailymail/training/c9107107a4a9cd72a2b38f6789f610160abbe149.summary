by @entity0 , defence correspondent published : 20:53 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 7 november 2013 a @entity1 accused of executing a seriously - wounded @entity3 prisoner wrote in his diary that he pleaded with his commander to shoot the stricken man , a court martial heard			1
the 25 - year - old serviceman , identified only as @entity9 , described how he desired to kill the injured @entity11 insurgent – and was ‘ waiting to pop him ’			1
he recorded in his diary that his sergeant , known as @entity14 , refused – then blasted the enemy captive in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol			1
@entity14 is on trial with two comrades , identified as @entity21 and @entity9 , who allegedly helped and encouraged the killing of the detainee during a patrol in @entity26			1
file photo @entity28 wrote how he felt ‘ mugged off ’ that he had not been allowed to pull the trigger			1
his barrister , @entity30 , yesterday told the court martial that the diary should be treated ‘ with caution ’ as it was ' simply unreliable '			0
he said @entity9 and his comrades had been encouraged to write diaries by the @entity36 as a ‘ coping mechanism ’ to deal with the stress of fighting on the frontline in @entity11			1
some entries had been ‘ embellished , exaggerated and distorted , ’ mr @entity40 told the seven - strong court martial board			2
@entity9 is on trial for murder along with two comrades , @entity14 and @entity43 and @entity21 allegedly helped and encouraged @entity14 to kill the detainee during a patrol in @entity26 on september 15 , 2011			1
all three deny the charges			0
film footage of the shooting , captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of @entity21 , has been played to the hearing in @entity56 , @entity57			0
the victim was found with an @entity60 assault rifle and grenade after an @entity63 helicopter blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a @entity67 base			0
on the video , @entity9 can be heard asking if he could shoot the wounded prisoner in the head and heart – but he dismissed this as ‘ banter ’ to defuse stressful situations			1
the court martial in @entity56 , @entity57 , continues @entity9 has told the court martial how up to 20 comrades had already been killed or maimed by @entity3 bombs and bullets by the day of the incident			1
some victims ’ blown off limbs had been hung in trees by insurgents as ‘ trophies ’			0
in his closing statement , mr @entity40 said @entity9 was the point man operating the @entity90 bomb detector , sweeping the ground for @entity92			1
it meant the married marine was most at risk of stepping on a booby - trap bomb			2
he said : ' it is difficult to think of a more stressful , demanding job			0
he was physically exhausted , his nerves were frayed , he was jumping at every bang and loud noise			0
' referring to the diary , mr @entity40 said : ‘ it is not supposed to be a near accurate account of events ; in part it was a therapeutic aid , a way of releasing the stress that @entity9 was under by putting his thoughts down on paper			2
' some things are factually accurate , some things have been embellished , exaggerated and distorted			0
' it is venting the tensions and stresses of an operational tour , combining events and facts with emotions and feelings			0
that is a heady mix. ' he said it was just ' bravado ' because @entity9 was ' scared and angry '			2
mr @entity40 said writing down feelings was a recognised psychological technique , outlined in a pamphlet called @entity36 : @entity131 which was handed to all troops			0
he said : ‘ it seems a little harsh to encourage an individual to write down their feelings on combat stress and then to use these jottings against that individual			0
' do n't condemn @entity9 for a couple of pages of a diary written with hindsight , demonstrably false in some places , written as a way of coping with tensions and stresses , not an accurate chronicle of events			1
' mr @entity40 said @entity9 had been ordered away from the victim when he was shot so was ‘ not present ’			2
he said : ' it was sudden spur - of - the - moment decision made by @entity14 alone , without encouragement or assistance from @entity155 ' the court martial continues			2
