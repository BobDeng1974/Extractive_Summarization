by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 09:58 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 : 12:26 est , 19 december 2013 on road to freedom : @entity7 's former richest man @entity6 is set to be pardoned by @entity8 after ten years in jail president @entity8 says he will pardon one of his best - known opponents , the jailed oil tycoon @entity6			1
@entity8 made the announcement that he would soon free @entity6 , once @entity7 's richest man , after a marathon news conference in which he exuded confidence that he has reasserted his authority in the face of street protests			1
he also confirmed that women from the @entity21 group would be also be released			2
but he remained firm on @entity7 's response to a @entity24 protest over @entity26 oil drilling which he said should serve as a lesson even though all charges against them look set to be dropped under a new amnesty bill			1
he insisted that @entity32 would toughen steps to guard against interference in its development of the region			0
@entity6 , 50 , spectacularly fell out with @entity8 a decade ago and had his @entity38 oil company dissolved following his arrest on fraud and tax evasion charges in 2003			1
he became @entity8 's nemesis , a symbol of what investors say is the @entity47 's abuse of the courts for political ends - and share prices rose in @entity32 on the news he would be pardoned			1
@entity8 has long singled out @entity6 , who would be due for release in august , for bitter personal attacks , once saying that ' a thief should sit in jail '			0
on thursday , he said : ' he has been in jail already more than 10 years			0
this is a serious punishment			0
' saying that @entity6 's mother was ill , he added : ' i decided that , with these circumstances in mind , we should make a decision to pardon him			1
' @entity7 stocks rose by 1.3 per cent after @entity8 's comment , even though his lawyers and mother said he had not asked for a pardon			1
one of the lawyers said , however , that @entity8 did not need a pardon request to release him from prison			0
sympathetic : @entity7 president @entity8 discusses his decision to pardon his political nemesis in part because of his mother 's ill health - a move which caused share prices to rise @entity6 ( pictured being escorted into court in 2011 ) spectacularly fell out with @entity8 a decade ago and had his oil company dissolved following his arrest on fraud and tax evasion charges in 2003 @entity8 today made the controversial claim that there was no difference between ' dictators ' @entity91 and @entity93			1
the @entity47 leader was commenting on plans to restore statues of the @entity98 tyrant and other @entity100 leaders more than two decades after they were toppled			2
one contentious plan backed by @entity7 hardliners would see monuments to @entity91 and the feared founder of the @entity98 secret services @entity106 brought back in @entity32 , moves which @entity8 likened to the monument to @entity93 outside the @entity109			2
' how in particular is @entity93 so different from @entity91 ? can you tell me ? not in any way at all , ' he said			0
' from the point of view of liberals , he is the same bloody dictator			0
' of @entity93 - a soldier and statesman who signed @entity120 's death warrant before becoming @entity122 's protector - he said : ' he was quite a treacherous dude , one has to say			2
' investors had long seen the treatment of a man who built a business empire on the ruins of @entity98 communism as evidence of the weakness of property rights and the rule of law in @entity7			1
supporters say @entity6 was jailed to curb a political challenge to @entity8 , bring his oil assets under state control and send a signal to other wealthy ' oligarchs ' to toe the line			2
his assets were sold off , mainly into state hands			0
in the eyes of @entity47 critics at home and abroad , @entity6 's jailing is one of the biggest stains on the record of @entity8 , who was first elected president in 2000 and has not ruled out seeking another six - year term in 2018			1
@entity6 's mother , @entity151 , who will turn 80 next year , said she had just heard the reports and was unaware of a request for a pardon			2
' i want to believe he will pardon him , ' she told @entity157			0
' i want to believe @entity8 is not totally lost			0
' @entity6 is due for release in august			0
but he has previously had his jail term extended on other charges and analysts have said @entity8 would allow @entity6 to walk free only if he no longer regarded him as a political threat			2
freeing @entity6 and the two women from @entity21 , jailed over a profanity - laced protest against @entity8 in a @entity165 , could ease criticism of the president before the @entity168 in february			2
rivals : @entity8 has long singled out @entity6 , who would be due for release in august , for bitter personal attacks , once saying that ' a thief should sit in jail ' he has staked a great deal of personal prestige on the @entity175 , and is under fire over a law banning the spread of ' anti-gay propaganda ' among minors			0
meanwhile , @entity8 suggested @entity24 activists detained for a protest at a drilling platform operated by state - controlled @entity184 in september may have been carrying out an order to undermine @entity7 's development of @entity26 energy resources			1
' why was this ( protest ) carried out ? either it was to put pressure on a company or on someone 's orders interfere with @entity7 's offshore development , ' @entity8 said , suggesting foreign rivals could have been behind it but naming no nation			1
' this is a serious thing for us			0
and we do not plan to soften ( our stance ) , we will only be toughening it			0
' new law : @entity205 @entity24 activist @entity204 , from @entity206 , pictured in court in @entity208 , may finally be able to return home after a new law could see her charges for hooliganism dropped released : @entity214 , from @entity215 in @entity216 , was arrested by @entity7 authorities during a @entity24 protest in the @entity26 - he was freed on bail after spending two months in detention @entity7 's treatment of the 30 activists from 18 countries , has drawn criticism from @entity226 nations and a number of global celebrities			1
the 30 were held in custody for two months and face up to seven years in prison if tried and convicted			0
speaking at an annual news conference , @entity8 said an amnesty passed this week that lawyers say will enable the @entity24 activists to avoid trial and return home was not drafted with them in mind			1
' as for the fact that they can now get amnesty ... we are not doing this for them , ' @entity8 said			0
' what happened must be a lesson and should , i hope , dispose us , with @entity24 , to working positively together			1
