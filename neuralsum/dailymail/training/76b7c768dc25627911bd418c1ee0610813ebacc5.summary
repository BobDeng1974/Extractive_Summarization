@entity2 , 73 , told how she feared for her life after being stripped and having boiling water poured down her back when raiders burst into her home			1
the two masked men had used a ladder to break into the widow ’s house through a bedroom window			2
they crept downstairs and surprised her as she watched the @entity23 on television			2
after grabbing more than £ 150,000 worth of jewellery from one safe they demanded she open a second , larger one under the stairs			1
but the safe , which was empty , had not been used in 12 years and mrs @entity2 could not open it despite remembering the combination			1
that led to a terrifying three - hour ordeal in which the attackers used waterboarding – a form of torture in which the victim is made to feel they are about to be drowned			1
the men took underwear from mrs @entity2 ’s bedroom and forced it into her mouth before dragging her into the en - suite bathroom			1
they pulled her head back over the bath and covered her face with a towel they kept flooded with water from the shower head			1
‘ they did this to me three times but i just could n’t open the safe , ’ she said			1
‘ i kept telling them it was empty but they did n’t believe me			0
’ mrs @entity2 , who lives on a private estate in @entity60 , @entity61 , told the @entity1 : ‘ i was absolutely terrified , i thought they were going to kill me			2
‘ they asked me if i had any grandchildren , i told them i had ten and they said “ we are going to kill you , do you think your grandchildren will miss you ? ” ‘ i was consumed by fear			0
it was sheer hell and all i can remember is praying			0
’ a spokesman for @entity61 police said : ' @entity73 officers have arrested a 31 - year - old man from @entity75 in connection with an aggravated burglary in @entity78 in @entity60			1
' the man was arrested on tuesday , august 7 and remains in police custody and inquiries are ongoing			2
' mrs @entity2 's six - bedroomed house had been broken into several weeks before the attack last friday and @entity73 believe the raiders had located the two safes at that point			1
mrs @entity2 , who had spent the early part of the day of her ordeal with friends at the @entity23 fencing , said the men first attacked her in the bedroom			1
‘ one of them was forcing my head down on to the bed as the other one went down to the safe , ’ she said			2
he kept saying have you got any money and i kept telling him i did n’t			0
‘ as i was on the bed i tried to press a panic button , i was an inch away but they saw what i was trying to do and from then they started to get really angry			0
’ the two men broke into mrs @entity2 's six - bedroom @entity61 home as she was watching the @entity23 on friday night the raiders got a kettle from the kitchen and poured boiling water over her back and arm but mrs @entity2 was still unable to help them open the safe			1
after the waterboarding , one raider threatened to cut off one of her fingers with a pair of secateurs but the other shouted back : ‘ no , the f * * * ing bitch will bleed to death			1
’ mrs @entity2 said : ‘ then they tied me to the towel rail with cable they had ripped from a nearby radio , they cut off my trousers and t - shirt with scissors			1
‘ i was trembling because i thought they were going to rape me and i just kept praying			0
‘ i was semi-conscious but eventually i realised they were gone and i had to bite myself out of the wires to get free			0
‘ i can not describe the relief when the police eventually arrived i felt like i had been through sheer hell and i was terrified that i was going to die			0
’ mrs @entity2 had been living alone in her detached mansion since her husband @entity139 , a businessman , died suddenly in 1998 aged 58			2
but she is now too petrified to return to her home and plans to live with her youngest son , @entity142			0
the 42 - year - old senior executive for @entity144 , said : ‘ we are very keen that the people who did this are caught so we can get closure for my mum			2
‘ and also because these people will strike again and then it could be even more violent			0
my mother is very lucky to be alive , someone has to make a stand			0
’ detective inspector @entity155 of @entity73 said : ‘ this was an appalling unprovoked attack on a defenceless elderly woman in her own home			0
‘ @entity73 is carrying out a thorough and extensive investigation to bring these cowardly offenders to justice			0
’ anyone with any information should call @entity73 on 101 or crime stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 .			0
