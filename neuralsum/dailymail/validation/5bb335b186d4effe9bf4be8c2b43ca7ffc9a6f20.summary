playing @entity0 in the @entity2 quarter - finals holds no fears for @entity4 - providing he does not have to take the train to @entity6			1
the @entity8 's whirlwind beginning to life at @entity10 looks set to continue with a starting spot on sunday			1
injury problems in defence prompted @entity10 boss @entity15 to take @entity4 on a month 's loan from @entity17 on wednesday , the same day they played @entity18 wednesday in the @entity19			1
three hours after meeting his team - mates for the first time , @entity4 walked out onto the pitch at @entity23 and was instrumental in the victory that just about keeps @entity10 's play - off hopes alive			1
@entity4 made a good start to his @entity10 career after joining on loan from @entity17 @entity4 said : ' i got a call from the manager in the morning and i was told i was going on loan and i was hopefully playing that night			1
' i had to collect my stuff from @entity34 , sign some paperwork and then be on a train			2
i got on the wrong train , asked the ticket man if it was going to @entity18 to find out i had to get off and get on another train			1
' after that finally i recognised some people in @entity10 kit at the train station and from there i was in safe hands			1
i met the team , did pre-game stuff and then just played			2
' i was just really happy to play			0
it 's been a while			0
i knew me thinking too much would n't be good , i just wanted to get on the pitch as soon as possible and establish myself in the team			0
' @entity4 began his career at home - town club @entity53 and joined @entity17 in january after being recommended to @entity17 boss @entity56 by former @entity53 manager @entity57			1
@entity57 played for @entity56 at @entity10 , where he was captain and a hugely popular figure			1
@entity8 international @entity4 joined @entity17 in january from @entity60 side @entity53 ' it was funny coming to @entity10 and walking through the facility and then seeing him amongst the boards , ' said @entity4			1
' @entity57 has been a mentor since he came to @entity53			0
he really has a lot of faith in me and has really guided me along my journey			0
i knew he was a big figure here and he was a solid defender everywhere he went			0
' @entity71 also played here , who 's a close friend of mine , so i knew it would be a good move for me			0
' the 21 - year - old has never been to @entity6 before but did face @entity0 on their pre-season tour to @entity78 in 2012			1
he knows securing the win needed to get to @entity81 will be a huge task but has been impressed by the togetherness of the squad			0
@entity4 played against @entity0 in @entity78 in a pre-season game - but has never been to @entity6 @entity4 said : ' i 'm still getting familiar with a lot of the guys but on the pitch it was great because there was constant chatter and communication and i just thought they believed in me from the get - go			1
' when we get the test on sunday , i think we 'll definitely be ready			0
there 's a lot of quality players in here so i think if we can go there and do our job , as long as we stay together as a team , it 's definitely possible to get a result			0
' i 'm not going to shy away from the opportunity			0
these are the games where you can really see how far you are from the top level			0
' @entity15 is definitely without three defenders in injured trio @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , while @entity112 is a major doubt			0
but the @entity10 boss has total faith in his new man , saying : ' full credit to him and his character			2
' he 's been brought in to play games for us and we have to thank @entity17 for allowing him to come to us			2
everybody at @entity17 spoke very highly of him and his performance on wednesday backed that up			2
' we would n't have any problems playing him on sunday against @entity0			2
