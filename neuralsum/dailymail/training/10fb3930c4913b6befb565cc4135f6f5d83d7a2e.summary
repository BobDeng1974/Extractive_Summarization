you never thought you could catch them out , certainly not with what i ’d call basic tactics like this			2
‘ and yet when you talk about typical @entity3 , he ’s got to affect the culture at that football club and it runs right the way through it			1
‘ this is a coach who had a bright team , an alert team last season			2
he ’s got to affect the culture at this football club			2
‘ it ’s what i think of @entity3 historically , never ready , weak , weak up here ( in the head ) , and they have to change that culture			1
‘ i think @entity6 needs to be given two or three years to run amok through that club to get rid of that type of attitude			2

we did it in the first half and then in the second half we did n’t expect them ( @entity75 ) to come at us			0
‘ we were too relaxed and this can not happen again			0
we need to speak about it			0
‘ personally there are some reasons why in the second half we did n’t do so well but we will talk with the team about it			0
a lot of people have their opinion so we will talk internally			0

it ca n’t happen again because we could have ended up drawing or losing			0
