by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 3 april 2013 a comic book fan has become the proud owner of a full - sized , working replica of the @entity4 , but will have to wait a few years before he can use it to catch criminals as he is only six years old			2
@entity7 is the envy of the school after his grandfather converted an old @entity11 into the iconic superhero car			1
@entity13 , 63 , spent more than £ 5,000 so that his grandchild could dress up and act out his favourite fight scenes from the @entity17 comics			1
little hero : young @entity20 fan @entity7 sits behind the wheel of his very own @entity4 , custom made for him by his grandfather @entity7 even has his own @entity22 - his grandfather ’s garage in @entity25 , @entity26 - and he travels from his family home near @entity29 most weekend ’s to get behind the wheel of his batmobile			1
mr @entity13 , a retired mechanic , converted the old @entity11 after the car failed its @entity32 , modelling it on the old fashioned @entity33 driven by @entity34 in the 1960s tv series			1
he cut off the roof , adding a red trim , wings , an elaborate exhaust and a custom windscreen , as well as flashing lights , a red batphone and @entity20 's iconic logo stuck on the steering wheel			0
mr @entity13 said : ‘ when we gave the car to him he was absolutely amazed			2
‘ he could n't believe his eyes , he was so excited , it was worth all the effort just to see the look on his face			0
' @entity20 and @entity13 : @entity7 with his grandfather @entity53 who spent £ 5,000 to turn his old @entity11 into the iconic car , outside mr @entity53 's home in @entity25 , @entity56 bat - fan : @entity7 , who lives near @entity29 , visits his grandfather in @entity56 most weekends to play with his car dark squire : despite being eleven years away from a licence , @entity7 is the proud owner of a car , and his grandfather believes he will be able to take it on the road in the future ‘ he loves @entity20 but he tells me that i 'm his real hero now			1
he comes down whenever he can he loves playing games in the car			0
‘ he sits in the drive pretending to be batman , singing the theme song and acting out fight scenes , shouting ‘ @entity75 , smash , biff , boff ’			0
‘ it 's a big toy for him , something that he will remember all his life			0
’ although not allowed on the road lacking an @entity32 , @entity13 believes with a few minor modifications the @entity4 will be road worthy			1
thankfully , @entity13 has plenty of time to make the changes as it will be another 11 years before @entity7 is eligible to apply for a driving licence			1
fighting crime : the @entity4 comes complete with a warning , flashing light and a @entity92 original : @entity7 's @entity4 is modelled on the classic version from the 1960s television series starring @entity96 and @entity34 in the meantime , @entity7 , from @entity97 , @entity29 , and the @entity4 will be forced to remain on the drive , but this does not seem to damped the mood of the six - year - old			1

i have been into @entity20 since i was two			0
‘ it is brilliant , i really enjoyed getting in it			0
