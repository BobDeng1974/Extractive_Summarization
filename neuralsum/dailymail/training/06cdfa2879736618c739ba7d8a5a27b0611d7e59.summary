by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 04:37 est , 30 april 2012 staff on @entity4 cruise ships paid just 75p an hour are having their tips withheld unless they reach certain performance targets , it was reported today			1
in a move designed to make crew ' more responsive ' , staff are having their bonuses cut unless their work matches pre-agreed customer feedback ratings , some of which are more than 96 per cent			1
the extreme end of the scale sees junior waiters on a cruise from @entity20 earning just £ 250 a month , with a possible £ 150 in bonuses , according to the @entity22			2
pay package : crewmembers on @entity4 ships will have their bonuses withheld unless they meet certain performance targets documents seen by the newspaper claim this pay , for 11 - hour shifts , seven days a week , represents a ' significantly increased basic salary '			1
@entity31 , ceo of @entity32 , the firm in charge of @entity4 cruises , told the @entity22 that customers were ' reluctant to pay the recommended level of tipping ' , claiming the move had made crew ' much happier			1
' he said : ' you 've got staff from eastern @entity43 in restaurants in @entity45 – why ? because it 's great money			0
' yes , the minimum wage is more than we pay , but this is a global industry , our businesses have to remain competitive			0
@entity4 boss @entity31 defended the pay move , saying it has made crew ' much happier ' ' let 's not forget the level of take - home pay for our staff , the vast majority of whom come from @entity63			1
look at hotels in @entity65			0
the earning ability is greater on our ships			0
' many restaurants have already phased out cash tipping in favour of electronic tips which are automatically added to customers ' bills			0
however , @entity4 bosses have opted to remove the risk of tips not being paid by paying bonuses if targets are met			2
mr @entity31 said the new measures have been handled ' fairly and decently ' to make sure staff pay is protected , but the move is likely to attract criticism for the treatment of already low - earning crewmembers			2
the new system will see bonus payments withheld if performances do not match certain customer feedback ratings			1
for example , cabin stewards whose work performance does not match a 92 per cent approval rating ave bonuses worth 15 per cent of their salary held back .			0

staff must meet customer feedback ratings to receive bonuses
@entity4 chief claims move has made staff ' much happier '
