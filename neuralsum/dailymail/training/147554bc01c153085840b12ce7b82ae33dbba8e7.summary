by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 00:53 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 25 may 2013 a federal judge ruled friday that the office of @entity6 's self - proclaimed toughest sheriff systematically singled out @entity7 in its trademark immigration patrols , marking the first finding by a court that the agency racially profiles people			1
the decision by @entity6 district judge @entity14 in @entity15 backs up years of allegations from @entity19 sheriff @entity18 's critics who say his officers violate the constitutional rights of @entity7 in relying on race in their immigration @entity23 , whose ruling came more than eight months after a seven - day , non-jury trial , also ruled @entity18 's deputies unreasonably prolonged the detentions of people who were pulled over			1
racial profiler : @entity6 's self - proclaimed ' toughest sheriff ' has claimed for more than a decade that his office does n't profile @entity7 the ruling marks a thorough repudiation of the immigration patrols that made @entity18 a national political figure , and it represents a victory for those who pushed the lawsuit			1
' for too long the sheriff has been victimizing the people he 's meant to serve with his discriminatory policy , ' said @entity42 , director of the @entity44 @entity43			0
' today we 're seeing justice for everyone in the county			0
' monetary damages were n't sought in the lawsuit but rather a declaration that @entity18 's office engages in racial profiling and an order that requires it to make policy @entity56 , the lead lawyer who argued the case against @entity18 , said @entity59 set a hearing for june 14 where he will hear from the two sides on how to make sure the orders in the ruling are carried @entity66 sheriff , who has repeatedly denied the allegations , wo n't face jail time as a result of friday 's @entity71 , @entity72 's lead attorney in the case , said an appeal was planned in the next 30 days			1
' in the meantime , we will meet with the court and comply with the letter and spirit of the order , ' he said.a small group of @entity7 alleged in their lawsuit that @entity18 's deputies pulled over some vehicles only to make immigration status checks			1
the group asked @entity14 to issue injunctions barring the sheriff 's office from discriminatory policing and the judge ruled that more remedies could be ordered in the future			1
sideshows : when he 's not rounding up @entity7 , @entity18 keeps the media interested by forcing jail inmates to wear pink underwear and live in outdoor tents the group also accused the sheriff of ordering some immigration patrols not based on reports of crime but rather on letters and emails from @entity104 who complained about people with dark skin congregating in an area or speaking @entity109			1
the group 's attorneys noted @entity18 sent thank - you notes to some who wrote the @entity115 sheriff said his deputies only stop people when they think a crime has been committed and that he was n't the person who picked the location of the patrols			2
his lawyers said there was nothing wrong with the thank - you @entity125 , the group 's lawyer , said he was still reading the decision friday but noted it contained " very detailed findings of discriminatory intent and effect			0
" @entity71 said that @entity135 's position ' is that it has never used race and will never use race in its law - enforcement decisions			0
' he added the sheriff 's office relied on ' bad training ' from the @entity141 and @entity142 call to @entity144 officials in @entity15 for comment was n't immediately returned friday @entity146 , who turns 81 next month , was elected in november to his sixth consecutive term as sheriff in @entity151 's most populous @entity150 for his self - aggrandizing sideshows like jailing inmates in tents and making prisoners wear pink underwear , @entity18 started doing immigration enforcement in 2006 amid @entity151 voter frustration with the state 's role as the nation 's busiest illegal entryway			2
stats do n't lie : immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 ' crime suppression ' sweeps conducted by @entity18 's office since january 2008 @entity14 wrote that ' in the absence of further facts that would give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause that a violation of either federal criminal law or applicable state law is occurring , ' @entity18 's office now is enjoined from enforcing its policy ' on checking the immigration status of people detained without state charges , using @entity182 ancestry or race as any factor in making law enforcement decisions pertaining to whether a person is authorized to be in the country , and unconstitutionally lengthening stops			1
' @entity14 added ' the evidence introduced at trial establishes that , in the past , the @entity135 has aggressively protected its right to engage in immigration and immigration - related enforcement operations even when it had no accurate legal basis for doing so			0
' the trial that ended aug. 2 focused on @entity7 who were stopped during both routine traffic patrols and special immigration patrols known as ' sweeps			0
' during the sweeps , deputies flood an area of a city - in some cases , heavily @entity204 areas - over several days to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders			0
immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 sweeps conducted by his office since january 2008 , according to figures provided by @entity18 's @entity218 trial , plaintiffs ' lawyers drew testimony from witnesses who broke down in tears as they described encounters with authorities , saying they were pulled over because they were @entity182 and officers wanted to check their immigration status , not because they had committed an infraction			1
the sheriff 's attorneys disputed such characterizations , typically working to show that officers had probable cause to stop the drivers based on a traffic violation			0
victory : critics have been saying @entity7 for nearly two decades			0
now it 's official @entity236 ' lawyers also presented statistics to show @entity7 are more likely to be stopped on days of immigration patrols and showed emails containing offensive jokes about people of @entity243 heritage that were circulated among sheriff 's department employees , including a supervisor in @entity18 's immigrant smuggling squad.defense lawyers disputed the statistical findings and said officers who circulated offensive jokes were disciplined			1
they also denied the complaint letters prompted patrols with a discriminatory @entity253 ruling used @entity18 's own words in interviews , news conferences and press releases against him as he trumpeted his efforts in cracking down on immigrants			2
when it came to making traffic stops , @entity18 said in 2007 that deputies are not bound by state laws in finding a reason to stop immigrants			0
' @entity267 is an operation , whether it 's the state law or the federal , to go after illegals , not the crime first , that they happen to be illegals , ' the ruling quoted @entity18 as saying			2
' my program , my philosophy is a pure program			2
i 'm not afraid to say that			0
and you go after them and you lock them up			0
' some immigrant traffic stops were made ' purely on the observation of the undercover officers that the vehicles had picked up hispanic day laborers from sites where @entity204 day laborers were known to gather , ' the ruling @entity281 judge also said the sheriff 's office declared on many occasions that racial profiling is strictly prohibited and not tolerated , while witnesses said it was appropriate to consider race as a factor in rounding up immigrants			1
' this is a blow to ' the sheriff 's office , said @entity298 , a law professor at the @entity299 who studied racial profiling and wrote a book on the @entity303 's lawyers will have ' an uphill climb ' in the appeals process because of all ' the gross statistical evidence , ' he said .			2

a federal judge ruled today that @entity19 sheriff @entity18 's office racially profiles @entity7 , a claim that has been made by critics for more than a decade
immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 ' crime suppression ' sweeps his office has conducted in the last several years
@entity18 : ' my program , my philosophy is a pure program . you go after illegals . i 'm not afraid to say that . and you go after them and you lock them up . '
evidence shown at trial demonstrates that @entity18 's deputies made disparaging remarks about @entity7 during the sweeps
