it is a sight that will cheer campaigners across the land			2
after blighting the @entity4 for more than two decades , four giant turbines have been removed from the stunning landscape – the first ever windfarm in @entity7 to be scrapped			1
to the delight of residents and walkers there are once again unspoilt views across the rolling hills and deep blue waters of @entity15 , near @entity16			0
eyesore : the four turbines near @entity19 , @entity4 , were the subject of years of anti-windfarm campaigns before their removal and to their relief , the 150ft high turbines will not be replaced after the council refused permission for two even bigger machines			1
the eyesores were put up in 1992 by @entity29 to power the reservoir ’s pumping stations in the face of fierce local opposition			0
but according to campaigners , the turbines have not worked in years			1
in an unprecedented move , the utility company sent in contractors at the end of last month to dismantle the rusting structures			0
@entity41 , who set up the @entity42 against the @entity43 , said : ‘ this is a real @entity45 versus @entity47 victory for residents - and the democratic process won out			0
there was almost unanimous feeling among the parishes that these eyesores were not wanted			0
‘ we have been told it is the first time in @entity56 that a wind farm of this scale has been taken down and not replaced			1
’ now : the locals have finally got their view back after the 150ft winds turbines at @entity15 wind have been dismantled he added : ‘ it ’s been a hell of a fight but we have proved it is possible to stop wind farms			1
‘ in recent years the turbines have hardly ever worked - they have turned the area into an industrial graveyard and look like rotting tooth stumps			1
‘ we have always opposed them - and plans for any replacements - on the grounds of health and safety , and the effect on the landscape			0
‘ this is a magnificent and beautiful part of the country so the proposed new turbines - twice the size of the old ones - would have very seriously affected several villages and nearby @entity88 which is classified as an ancient monument			2
’ another campaigner , @entity90 said : ‘ it is fantastic news - we all know that for three quarters of the time they have been here the turbines have not been working			2
’ @entity97 , the local planning authority , turned down a scheme for two bigger turbines to replace the demolished wind farm , after hearing listed buildings would be adversely affected by the ‘ intrusive ’ machines			1
and @entity103 warned they would refer the plans to central government if they were passed			0
they even wrote to the landowner , the @entity107 , who owns the 30,000 - acre @entity88 estate and leases the reservoir to @entity29			0
the @entity107 , who also owns the @entity112 estate , replied that he was happy to see the democratic process taking place			0
council development control officer @entity116 said : ‘ the turbines were originally granted permission in the early 90 ’s and one of the conditions was that if they ceased to be operational , they would have to be removed			1
’ @entity29 , owned by the @entity122 - based @entity121 , said it had no plans to appeal the decision to refuse permission for the new turbines			2
a spokesman for @entity127 , which represents the windfarm industry , said they were unaware of any large scale projects being taken down and not replaced .			2
