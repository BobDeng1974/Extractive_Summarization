by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 25 august 2013 reduced alcohol wine has been presented by the government as the answer to the crisis of drink - related illness and even drunkenness among the middle classes			1
now , the major wine labels are introducing brands that typically come in at an alcohol content of 5.5per cent , which is less than half the normal figure			2
@entity13 brands like @entity14 and @entity15 are marketing the new low alcohol wines on the basis that customers can safely have a relaxing glass and still drive home			1
reduced alcohol : traditional producers are sceptical about @entity13 brands @entity15 , left , and @entity14 , right , creating new low alcohol wines best of both worlds : manufacturers of the low alcohol wine hope that drinkers will still be able to enjoy wine without the negative side effects however , they are running up against a tide of opposition from both @entity34 wine experts and traditional producers in @entity36 and other parts of @entity38			1
for a drink that wants to be called wine is – under @entity42 law – required to have a minimum alcohol content of at least 8.5per cent			1
trend : @entity46 's @entity45 will go on sale in @entity48 in november for £ 4.99 @entity34 health minister , @entity49 , is lobbying in @entity50 to win a change in the definition , for there is a fear that these new low alcohol drinks will not succeed unless they are called wines			1
the low alcohol wines are made in exactly the same way as traditional vintages , which come in at between 11per cent and 15per cent alcohol			1
the change comes at the end of the process , when the alcohol is removed using a spinning centrifuge system or filtered out via a process called reverse osmosis			0
however , renowned wine expert , @entity68 , said : ‘ the problem with removing the alcohol is that it takes some of the flavour with it			2
' you are left with something that really just does not taste like wine			0
’ the @entity75 and the @entity76 are both 5.5per cent alcohol and sell for £ 4.99 a bottle in leading supermarkets			0
a 2013 @entity80 , which is made with @entity82 grapes , and a 2013 @entity83 , made with @entity85 grapes , will go on sale in @entity48 in november for £ 4.99			0
@entity49 claims that the market for low or reduced alcohol ‘ wines ’ has been increasingly rapidly			2
he insists that promoting low alcohol wines was in customers ’ ‘ best long term interests ’ , amid concerns over a rise in liver diseases and cancers linked to alcohol consumption			1
‘ the government has consistently made the case for change to the @entity42 wine rules to permit reduced and de-alcoholised products to be called wines , ’ he said			1
however , mr @entity68 said : ‘ this is the @entity34 government against the whole of wine making @entity38 and there is no real chance of success			0
’ he said there are some traditional wines that are relatively in low alcohol , for example some @entity116 types made with @entity118 grapes and the moscato wines from the north of @entity121			1
mr @entity68 said : ‘ of course it is a good idea for people to drink less alcohol			0
‘ there is a huge amount of alcohol - related disease , the road accidents , plus the aggressiveness and violence , but , personally , i do n’t believe that going for reduced alcohol wine is the best way to achieve a reduction in consumption			2
drink naturally lower alcohol wine if you want to , otherwise do n’t drink wine , beer and spirits , stick to water and fruit juice			2
‘ do n’t mess around with wine			0
’ drinks industry expert at retail analysts , @entity147 , @entity148 , said he sees a big future for these reduced alcohol wines			1
‘ i call them ' sessionable ' wine			0
that means you can drink a lot in one session , ’ he said			0

they 're absolutely fine , but they wo n't blow your socks off			0
