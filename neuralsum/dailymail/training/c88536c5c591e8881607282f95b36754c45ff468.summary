by @entity0 @entity3 @entity2 officials said wednesday that agents discovered a garage - sized hole through a steel fence that divides the @entity3 and @entity7 just east of @entity8 , @entity9			1
the announcement was the second one this week about problems with the border fence			1
sunday saw runoff from rainstorms knock down 60 feet of the rebar - reinforced steel fence just west of the @entity16 near @entity17 in @entity8			1
it was one of two incidents this past weekend that left parts of the fence down one way or another : officials say smugglers often attempt to cut holes in the fence that runs along the @entity3 - @entity7 border			1
they also try tossing things over and digging under the fence that fence stood between 18 and 26 feet high and extended at least 7 feet underground			2
the hole in a section of the fence 1 Â½ miles east of the @entity8 city limits was discovered by agents on saturday			1
the @entity2 says it is working on repairs for both fences and has agents monitoring the areas			0
' smugglers often attempt to cut border fences ; dig under them ; climb over them ; and even throw things over the fence , ' @entity40 spokeswoman @entity40 said in a written statement			2
' as the @entity47 continues to improve deterrence efforts along the border , smuggling organizations are finding it more difficult to move their illicit goods into the interior of the @entity3			0
fencing infrastructure gives @entity2 agents the time they need to stop illegal cross-border activity			0
' the storms that caused the fencing to topple began friday in @entity60 , @entity7 , and resumed saturday night until sunday morning , when debris from the @entity7 side of the border traveled through a wash and piled up against the border fence			2
the fence was built in 2011			0
it is constantly monitored by agents because smugglers and others who attempt to cross illegally routinely try to breach or knock down parts of it			0
the @entity2 says it does not keep track of fence breaches or attempted breaches , but it does have a special unit devoted to finding and destroying underground tunnels used to smuggle drugs			0
whether it 's cutting through steel fences with special tools or building long and elaborate tunnels , smugglers have no shortage of creative ways to try to bypass the law and sneak drugs into the @entity3 more problems : the hole was the second discovered in a week after workers sunday discovered a 60 - foot section that had collapsed due to rainwater runoff along the same stretch in 2012 , suspected smugglers who tried to use ramps to drive an suv over a 14 - foot - tall border fence in southeast corner of @entity99 became stuck on top of the barrier			1
@entity2 agents found the jeep teetering atop the fence about five miles west of the @entity104 and the @entity9 state line			1
the jeep was empty , but agents said they believe it was filled with contraband before it got stuck			0
just last month , agents in @entity9 spotted a truck made to look like it belonged to the @entity114 , a federal agency			2
the decals on the truck turned out to be fake			0
but the 3,200 pounds of marijuana in it were real			0
collapse : the collapse occurred just west of the @entity16 in @entity8 , @entity9 , sundayafter severe storms in southern @entity9 over the weekend			1

border *patrol* in @entity9 discovered the hole over the weekend and announced the repairs wednesday
the news came the same week a 60 - foot gap in the fence was formed when rainwater runoff collapsed a section of the fence near @entity8
