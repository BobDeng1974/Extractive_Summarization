big problem : almost 6 million young people are neither in school nor working , according to a study released monday by @entity11 coalition ' this is not a group that we can write off			1
they just need a chance , ' said @entity34 , executive director of the coalition of businesses , advocacy groups , policy wonks and nonprofit organizations dedicated to increasing economic mobility			0
' the tendency is to see them as lost souls and see them as unsavable			0
' but changing the dynamic is not going to be easy			0
the coalition also finds that 49 states have seen an increase in the number of families living in poverty and 45 states have seen household median incomes fall in the last year			1

topping the list of supportive states are @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			1
at the bottom ? @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1

we do n't have a lack of young people who need this opportunity , ' @entity92 added			2
just look at some of the nation 's largest cities			0
@entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , @entity122 , all have more than 100,000 idle youth , the @entity11 report found			1
' often times they lack the social capital in life , ' @entity92 said			0
' there 's a whole pool of talent that is motivated , loyal and hardworking			0
' they just ca n't get through an employer 's door , he added			0
that 's why @entity93 spends a year working with high school graduates to teach them career skills such as computer programming or equipment repair they can use when the program ends			2
it also includes life coaching so they can learn skills such as time management			2

@entity88 has an overall unemployment rate of 8 per cent , while @entity167 posts about 7 per cent			1
like most states , they saw their unemployment rate fall since 2011 , but researchers caution that shift could come from fewer residents looking for work and from more who had simply given up their search for jobs			1
way forward : @entity181 , president of @entity182 in @entity183 , has helped rally community organizations in his city to develop a pilot program to help students as young as 14 find summer work and it 's not as though the challenges emerge from nowhere			2
quality early childhood programs help students from poor families overcome societal hurdles , and on - time high school graduation rates often follow quality schools - other factors @entity11 examined in its report			2
