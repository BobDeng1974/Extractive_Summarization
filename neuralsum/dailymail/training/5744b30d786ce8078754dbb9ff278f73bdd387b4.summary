by @entity0 published : 14:47 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 20:36 est , 26 march 2013 if you have six different jobs , one office romance and are late 154 times , you ’re the typical @entity5 worker			1
mr or miss average also takes 125 days off sick and goes through ten job interviews before retirement			2
we also drink 32,396 cups of tea or coffee at our desks and get eight sizable pay rises			0
stress : 2,000 @entity5 workers were polled in the study which found that the average employee will take 125 days off sick from work and have 875 arguments with other colleagues surprisingly , a survey of 2,000 employees also found we only grumble about the boss 623 times over four decades – or around 14 times a year			1
although we have one office romance , we apparently have just three major bust - ups with our colleagues			0
the unpredictable economic climate also means the average worker will endure at least one period of unemployment or redundancy			1
he or she is likely to have at least one period during their working life where doctors will sign them off with stress			2
number of different jobs - 6 number of companies worked at - 6 pay rises - 12 major bust ups / arguments - 3 small disagreements / grumbles - 875 office romances - 1 cups of tea / coffee - 45,500 sick days - 125 late for work - 188 periods of unemployment - 1 job interviews - 10 periods of serious financial worries - 2 redundancy - 1 periods of stress - 3 relationship strain due to long hours - 2 signed off work with stress - 1 financial stability is a big concern for many adults , despite an average starting wage of £ 10,983.50 , people still struggle to cope with the rising cost of living			1
most will work their way through two long periods of financial worry before seeing light at the end of the tunnel			0
for 34 per cent of the population , this means finding a second job to make ends meet			1
four in ten admit the demands of their job have had a negative impact on family life and relationships – with the average worker going through a rough patch with their partner at least twice			1
one third of those polled admitted they sometimes lose the balance between their work and personal life , letting long hours take over			0
and for 29 per cent , the stress of work and the impact it has had on their personal life has led to them seeking medical help			2
the survey was commissioned by healthcare provider @entity97			0
spokesman @entity99 said : ‘ we hear how @entity5 workers are working longer and harder than ever before but this health check of the average adult ’s working life confirms what we feared			1
within an average career span , you ’re likely to find reasons to grumble 14 times a year yet will only change jobs once a decade – perhaps because the grass is n’t necessarily greener on the other side			1
‘ heavy workloads and disagreements with colleagues can all take a heavy toll on our well - being and many of us are seeing this spill over into our home lives			0
‘ this is coupled with the ongoing threat of redundancy whilst the @entity5 economy struggles to get back on track			2
’ engineering workers will have the most pay rises over the course of their career , getting ten boosts to their salary over their working lifetime			0
those in hospitality have the least amount of pay rises getting just five			0
the culture and sport sector were also found to be the most likely to have an office romance as well as take more sick days than any other industry			0
mr @entity99 added : ‘ there are small positives – for example , those losing control of a work - life balance is still in the minority			0
‘ but with over a third of people needing to find second jobs , maintaining this balance will become a losing battle			1

study polled 2,000 @entity5 workers about their jobs
