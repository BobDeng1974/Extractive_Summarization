@entity0 is sitting in a restaurant in @entity2 , recalling the 12 absurd and wonderful chapters of his life that were spent in this part of town			1
‘ it was nuts , ’ he says			2
‘ you did n’t need @entity9 and @entity10 to lie about what went on — the reality was mad enough			2
’ in time , @entity0 will come back to the sore point of how the @entity2 side of the @entity15 was represented in a recent documentary			1
@entity0 laughs whilst recalling his eventful spell playing for @entity2 's @entity18 he will address the myth that the @entity18 was ruled by the bullying of @entity21 and @entity22 , even if there is a memory of the former stripped to his underpants and covered in baby oil ahead of a dressing - room fight			1
but , for now , @entity0 wants to laugh rather than seethe			1
the little striker , who won the @entity29 , once told @entity30 where to go and pocketed £ 200 for scouting @entity32 , wants to present a fuller picture of life at @entity35			1
‘ i remember @entity36 , ’ he says			2
‘ just after we won the @entity29 in 1988 players were getting sold and he was desperate for @entity39 to give him a big move			1
we went on a trip to @entity42 and he ’s bought a load of fireworks			2
back at the hotel , @entity45 is letting them off from the fifth floor into a crowded street			2
the locals are running for cover			2
@entity39 knew he was trying to force a move and would n’t budge			2
just another day at @entity2			1
’ the @entity2 players celebrate having won the 1988 @entity29 at @entity53 against favourites @entity54 @entity0 poses for the camera when speaking to @entity57 's @entity56 about his career @entity0 laughs			1
‘ there was a time when @entity9 was telling the newspapers he was getting threatening letters at the training ground , ’ he says			2
‘ we all knew it was rubbish so one day i cut out letters from a newspaper , like in the films , and spelled , “ @entity9 , we are watching your every move ”			2
i slipped it in his pocket and when he found it he starts panicking			2
he disappears with his big mobile phone and the next day ’s papers say @entity9 has had another threat			0
he always was a drama queen			0
’ @entity0 adds : ‘ my first day at the club , i saw @entity45 pinching the @entity82 badge off @entity22 ’s dad ’s truck			1
@entity22 was panicking that his dad was going to kill him			0
‘ there were a lot more laughs than people might have thought based only on the documentary			0
’ @entity21 , in action during his @entity2 playing days , was certainly a character in the @entity18 @entity0 , like most associated with the programme , the @entity18 , has taken exception to claims from @entity21 that he was ‘ the leader ’ and ruled by fear			1
‘ the truth is we tolerated @entity9 , ’ says @entity0 , who spent six years at the club			1
‘ he was a bit of a clown			0
he was the perfect player for us but he always tried to present himself as something he was n’t , even then			0
‘ yes , you had to be very tough to survive at the club			0
but there was so much more to how @entity2 achieved what we did			1
for @entity103 to imply he controlled our dressing room with intimidation is just false			0
‘ of course there were fights but @entity9 exaggerated			0
@entity10 told the story about @entity9 locking the dressing room and throwing an unnamed player against a bench and splitting his leg open			0
stitches , etc. @entity0 was former team - mate @entity120 's assistant at @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 ‘ the lad was @entity125 and , as i remember it , @entity9 strips to his pants and covers himself in baby oil			1
they slipped around a bit and no punches were thrown			0
yes , @entity125 badly injured his calf on the bench but it was not split open with blood everywhere			0
‘ the stories were all embellished			0
it was no @entity139 , it was more a boarding school of very naughty boys			0
’ a deeper perspective is found in @entity0 ’s new book , @entity143			1
it ’s a wonderful autobiography , self - written across three years			2
the book charts his rise from @entity147 , to @entity148 , to @entity149 and on to the high points at @entity2 , before @entity0 became @entity120 ’s assistant at @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity121			1
the 52 - year - old , in action for @entity2 ( right ) works for @entity154 , commenting on @entity156 football ‘ the game changed a bit in those three decades , ’ he says			1
‘ when @entity147 signed me as a kid they offered my parents a holiday and i was hoping they would choose somewhere abroad — they asked for this camp in @entity164 ! at least the club sent a limo			0
’ it was at @entity148 that @entity0 played alongside @entity168 and @entity169			1
‘ we went to @entity171 once , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ @entity169 and @entity172 were sharing and @entity173 was in with @entity168			0
we ’d all had a drink one night			0
‘ @entity175 and @entity176 got into the others ’ room at something like 3am and tossed all their gear in the courtyard			0
@entity168 and @entity173 go to fetch it but get locked out in the rain			0
@entity186 , they were out there for maybe an hour			0
@entity168 was getting all this abuse , @entity176 and @entity175 calling him a northern so - and - so and laughing at him , saying , “ no wonder @entity189 got rid of you ”			2
@entity2 players in training during the @entity18 era with @entity194 ( centre ) and @entity22 ‘ next thing there is a huge crash			1
@entity168 has found a fire extinguisher and thrown it through their window			0
i can still hear @entity168 saying , “ oh s * * *			0
i did n’t mean it			0
’ after three good years at @entity148 , @entity0 joined @entity149 for a difficult 18 months , in which he repeatedly felt ‘ belittled ’ by @entity205			1
‘ you could see the glow of his sunbed from the training pitch , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ he just picked on me for reasons i never understood			0
’ at one point , @entity0 pulled out of a move to @entity215 because he correctly anticipated @entity205 would be sacked and a fresh start might await			1
@entity205 ’s exit meant @entity30 ’s arrival			0
‘ @entity30 was always honest with me — a good man , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ i got the hairdryer once after a reserve game and told him to shove it all up his a * * *			0
@entity0 endured a difficult 18 months at @entity149 ( left ) and was brought to @entity2 in 1987 ‘ the next morning i went to apologise and he said he admired my spirit			1
i liked him but it never worked out for me at @entity149			0
’ @entity39 brought @entity0 to @entity2 in 1987 — the manager allegedly ate 12 sheep testicles to get @entity227 to sanction the move — and his playing career re-started			1
‘ i could have done a book on @entity2 alone , ’ he says			1
in retirement @entity0 went on to form a fine coaching partnership with @entity120 at @entity122 , which included capping @entity233 from @entity149 after ‘ my son realised from playing championship manager on the computer that he was eligible for us ’			2
@entity0 has detailed his eclectic career in a book called @entity143 , which is available at terrygibson.london in a career of surreal moments , it seems about right			2
there was also a £ 200 - a - week scouting position for @entity245 in @entity156 that saw him recommend @entity32			1
‘ the club did ok out of it , ’ he says			0
these days the 52 - year - old commentates on @entity156 football for @entity154 and is happy to be out of the thick of it			1
‘ i think i ’ve had probably enough of that craziness in my life , ’ he says			0
@entity0 ’s book @entity143 is available at www.terrygibson.london			2
