while most of us deal the prospect of our impending death by attempting to live meaningful lives , those with low self esteem often struggle with this			0
viewing themselves and their lives as worthless they can feel far more upset by existential thoughts than the rest of the population			0
now , research suggests that touch - even with something inanimate like a teddy - may genuinely help people with low self - esteem in confronting their own mortality			1
in a series of studies published in @entity32 , a journal of the @entity34 , researchers from @entity36 tested the hypothesis that people with low self - esteem deal with concerns about their own death and the meaning of their life by connecting with others			1
‘ even fleeting and seemingly trivial instances of interpersonal touch may help people to deal more effectively with existential concern , ’ explains psychological scientist and lead researcher @entity46			0
‘ this is important because we all have to deal with existential concerns and we all have times at which we struggle to find meaning in life , ’ he says			0
@entity46 and colleagues tested the hypothesis that people with low self - esteem deal with existential concerns by connecting with others			2
in one study , a researcher approached participants as they walked through a university campus			0
she handed the participants questionnaires to fill out ; for some of the participants , she accompanied the questionnaire with a light , open - palmed touch on the shoulder blade that lasted about one second			0
interestingly , participants with low self - esteem who received the brief touch reported less death anxiety on the questionnaire than those who had not been touched			1
those who had been touched also showed better social connectedness after being reminded of death in comparison to those who had not received the light pat. anyone with a beloved stuffed toy or teddy may feel they have always known it has genuine healing powers , but this is the first time science has confirmed it the research also suggests that individuals with low self - esteem may desire , and even seek out , touch when they are confronted with their own death			2
participants with low self - esteem who were reminded of death estimated the value of a teddy bear at about € 23 ( about £ 19 ) , while those who had not been reminded of death estimated the value at about € 13 euros ( £ 10 ) , a full € 10 less			1
being able to touch the teddy bear while estimating its value seemed to provide comfort to participants with low self - esteem , reducing their levels of common defensive reactions to reminders of death			1
‘ our findings show that even touching an inanimate object — such as a teddy bear — can soothe existential fears , ' notes @entity46			2
' interpersonal touch is such a powerful mechanism that even objects that simulate touch by another person may help to instill in people a sense of existential significance			0
’ @entity46 and colleagues believe that touch could be a useful supplement to more traditional therapies in treating low self - esteem and related disorders , such as depression and anxiety			1
the researchers are currently exploring the possibilities of simulated interpersonal touch through the use of a ‘ haptic jacket , ’ which can electronically give people the feeling that they are being hugged .			0

people with low self - esteem often struggle with their own mortality
study shows touch can help them with with anxiety around meaning of life
*revealed* even touch that *mimics* human touch - like a teddy bear - helps
researchers at @entity36 suggest may open new form of ' hug therapy ' for those with depression and anxiety
