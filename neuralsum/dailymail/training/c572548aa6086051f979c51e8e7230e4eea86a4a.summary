by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 according to those in @entity4 , @entity2 has never looked so relaxed			1
in his home country , meanwhile , his popularity is soaring			1
this is what good results do , of course			2
ten goals in three @entity13 games ahead of today ’s quarter - final have seen @entity16 ’s team play a central and starring role in the narrative of this tournament			1
those players at @entity21 who think that everything will be straight forward under their incoming manager may wish to pause a second , though			2
embrace : @entity2 puts an arm around his captain @entity26 @entity27 : @entity28 and @entity29 having a discussion in training as he outlined frankly when questioned by @entity34 journalists here yesterday , players must learn to work closely with him if they are to prosper			2
‘ i do n’t think anything is possible without it , ’ said @entity16 , when asked about the importance of unity			1
‘ i do n’t think we can achieve anything without harmony between players and staff			2
‘ we have this harmony here			2
all players and staff create harmony and all players and staff are convinced we can progress as far as possible			2
' i ’m a person who enjoys harmony			2
if people make it impossible then it becomes a problem			0
‘ the players have to pull it off			0
i ’m just a means to an end , no more than that			0
the players have to do it			0
' they are open minded — a fantastic group — the atmosphere is marvellous and everyone works for the best			0
that ’s what i ’m most proud of , making 23 players into a cohesive team			0
’ talking tactics : @entity16 with star forward @entity65 the circle : @entity16 addresses his players during the session the issue is relevant to @entity16 in his present role because of problems @entity4 have had in the past			1
it will be relevant next season at @entity75 , of course , because his predecessor , @entity77 , was undone by a group of players he simply could not see eye to eye with			1
@entity16 has a reputation for abrasiveness			1
there will be some small battles to be fought at @entity21			0
it is , however , a much more relaxed @entity16 who is leading @entity4 through this tournament			1
in his home country , he has not always been universally popular			1
there has been disquiet over the fact that he has spent so many of his coaching years outside of @entity4 , while his decision to play three central defenders going in to this tournament has been viewed by some as unduly negative			1
anyone who has seen @entity4 play in @entity97 , however , will find it hard to agree			1
cooling off : the team stop for a drink in the scorching conditions of @entity102 it was the @entity104 who kicked things off here with their 5 - 1 rout of @entity109 on day two and , though defensive deficiencies remain , they have reason to be confident that an attack , buoyed by the prime form of @entity65 and @entity26 , can continue to function			1
here in @entity102 yesterday , news was conveyed to @entity16 of a popularity that is , by all accounts , now going through the roof			1
‘ i ’m not getting all this news , ’ he said , smiling			0
‘ i understand there has been a turnaround , people have changed minds			0
i ’m really pleased this @entity13 came at the right time			0
‘ and yes , this is a new system [ 3 - 5 - 2 ] but it ’s incredibly clever that you can play this formation within three weeks			2
' we are used to playing different systems and we have players from foreign competitions that only started with it a few weeks prior to the championships			0
@entity135 : @entity28 performs a few flicks and tricks as he prepares for @entity138 lining one up : @entity16 getting stuck in with the ball at his feet ' but there is no mountain too high			1
we showed that in the [ 2 - 0 @entity145 ] victory against @entity146			0
’ @entity16 welcomes back his captain @entity28 today after he served a one - game suspension in their final group match			1
and he admitted that he was worried about the heat but would appear to have little concern about the threat posed by today ’s opposition			0
it is usual for competing teams to allow the media in to training sessions before match day for just 15 minutes			0
yesterday in the heat of @entity102 , however , @entity16 declared that he would keep the doors open throughout			1
‘ the newspapers always think they know my team anyway so what does it matter ? ’ he smiled			0
‘ i have no secrets out here			0
it is not my way			0

@entity104 manager will take no *nonsense* when he arrives at @entity75
@entity16 more relaxed and popular than ever at home
@entity4 thriving under new system as the head for last 16
