@entity0 has been accused of kowtowing to the @entity2 government after it pulled a program from its @entity2 app store which allowed users to bypass the country 's strict internet controls			1
the communist government of the @entity10 's @entity9 has passed laws which restricts internet browsing from ip addresses within its country , a project which has become known as ' the great firewall of @entity2 '			0
but developers from all over the world have tried to liberate @entity2 's online public by creating tools which allow users inside the country to bypass ' the wall ' and see content they would be able to in the outside world			2
kowtowing : @entity0 removed the @entity27 app from its @entity28 after pressure from the state banned : the app was used by @entity2 anti censorship protestors , above , who wanted to access websites which were banned by the government one tool , a free app called @entity38 , could be used by @entity2 people to randomise their ip to keep their browsing information private and prevent them form being directed to censored content			1
it was being sold on @entity0 's @entity2 version of the @entity45 until july this year , when it was pulled by the @entity47 computer giant who said that it contained ' illegal content '			1
despite this , a version of the app is still available in the rest of the world			0
the developers of @entity38 , who are small team of designers , say that the app was being downloaded around 2,000 times a day before it was pulled by @entity0			1
they received no notification from @entity45 bosses that their product was set to be removed and were only made aware of its deletion when users from @entity2 got in touch to ask where it was			2
when they contacted @entity0 , the tech giant confirmed that the app had been banned because it contained content which was illegal in @entity2 , and that developers have to abide by laws in the country they wish to sell their software			1

speaking to @entity80 , a developer , who asked not to be named , said : ' unfortunately , we 're not aware of any app developer ever ( who was successful ) in challenging @entity0 's decision			0

but @entity105 has since changed its policy and has been at pains to make the search experience for @entity2 browsers as liberal as possible			0
they even launched a tool which would tell @entity2 users when they were searching for a term which was banned by the government			2
