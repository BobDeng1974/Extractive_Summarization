by @entity1 reporter published : 20:55 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 21:16 est , 2 march 2013 prisons could be set to follow the rest of the country in introducing a smoking ban , leading to fears of unrest among inmates prisoners are to be banned from smoking , sparking fears they might riot when they are stopped from lighting up , it was revealed today			1
it is believed cigarettes will be outlawed from all 123 prisons in @entity16 and @entity17 within the next two years , according to the people			2
the @entity19 is introducing the ban following a long campaign from staff , who have objected to breathing in the second - hand smoke of inmates			1
instead , the criminals will be offered electronic cigarettes or nicotine patches to satisfy their cravings but there are concerns this might not be enough and that some will react angrily to the ban			2
with more than eight out of ten prisoners smoking there is also a belief contraband cigarettes could become valuable currency behind bars			0
a source is quoted in the paper as saying : ' it will happen			0
a pilot scheme will have to go ahead first but after that we will see it coming in at all prisons			0
' that has always been the aim since the government 's smoke - free legislation came into effect in 2007			2
smoking has been a huge concern among staff , who feel they are unfairly exposed to it			0
' but you have to fear for them when this does come in because it is unlikely to go down very well with the inmates			0
' jail bosses had hoped to ban smoking by january but the deadline has been pushed back after a planned pilot at jails including at @entity71 , @entity65 was postponed , but they are confident of introducing it within the next 24 months			1
it is accepted the ban must happen for health and safety reasons and to avoid officers seeking compensation claiming to be victims of passive smoking			0
@entity81 in west @entity82 would be one of 123 jails in @entity16 and @entity17 to ban smoking prisoners escaped the smoking ban due to a legal loophole which allowed cells to be designated ' permanent or temporary homes ' , but this is now set to be scrapped			1
some jails already ban the habit for bad behaviour			1
three years ago jailed rapist @entity95 , 25 , made an unsuccessful claim under the @entity97 after he called his smoking ban ' inhuman '			1
the @entity99 would not comment on the timescale of the ban .			0

jails were exempt from 2007 ban but @entity19 to outlaw it ' within two years '
