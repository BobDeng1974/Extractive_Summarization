@entity1 boss @entity0 has called for realism in their survival quest and insisted that their remaining fixtures will make it extremely tough to avoid relegation			1
they will escape the drop zone for the first time since november if they beat @entity13 at home on saturday by three goals and @entity16 fail to win at @entity17			2
they also have to face relegation rivals @entity20 and @entity16 away while welcoming @entity21 to the @entity22 on the final day of the season			2
back - to - back wins revived @entity1 ’s hopes of top - flight survival but @entity0 wants to keep a lid on expectations			1
he said : ‘ we believe in ourselves but we have seven left , five at home and one against @entity32			2
they are still extremely tough fixtures			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 is not taking anything for granted in the chase for survival @entity36 trains with team - mates ahead of @entity1 's game against @entity13 at the weekend ‘ we are aware we have had some bad luck from time to time			1
it ’s that belief in ourselves that has kept us going			0
’ @entity16 , meanwhile , have collected eight points from a testing run of eight games but now have to start turning some gritty displays into more positive results			1
having won only once since january , it could be the wrong time to be running into an @entity17 side that are unbeaten in four at @entity48 but manager @entity49 is not looking at form			1
he said : ‘ you ca n’t govern other people ’s situation			0
we have to focus on ourselves whether it ’s good or not good			0
when the whistle blows , we have a plan and are more looking at how we are going to operate			0
@entity58 celebrates scoring against @entity59 as the @entity61 record back - to - back wins ‘ we ’ve done a lot of work after being written off			1
we ’re certainly in the pack			0
performance-wise i ’ve been pleased but we have to win games			1
’ @entity17 manager @entity67 sees a fearlessness in @entity16 similar to that displayed by his @entity71 team in surviving against the odds in the @entity73			1
the @entity16 head to @entity48 having beaten @entity74 , drawn against @entity75 and narrowly defeated by @entity76 in the last month			1
@entity78 ace @entity77 is one of several players whose contracts expire at the end of the season they are two points from safety but @entity67 believes the fact they have been scrapping to get out of the bottom three all season — much like his @entity71 side in the four seasons he spent with them — gives them an advantage over teams who have been dragged into the race for survival			2
@entity67 said : ‘ when you are in a situation as clear as the one they have , they are only one step from getting away from the bottom three and that is an incredible incentive			0
’ @entity67 believes @entity49 will help @entity16 survive			0
‘ @entity49 has been an incredible leader and has set very good direction for his team , ’ he added			0
‘ when you get into a new league you sometimes do n’t get positive results after a successful season in the @entity108 and you start having doubts and wanting to change week after week			0
