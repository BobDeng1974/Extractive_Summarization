@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has seen @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 up close - and is in no doubt that he is the man to solve @entity6 's goalkeeping problems			1
@entity0 was @entity2 's opposite number as @entity3 beat @entity8 4 - 0 in the @entity9 last tuesday but the result could have turned differently after an astonishing save from @entity2 kept out a volley from @entity12 two minutes into the game			1
' he 's brilliant , ' @entity0 raved to fourfourtwo			0
' he has been fantastic in the @entity14 and here in the @entity9			0
' @entity2 earned another supporter by impressing @entity0 when @entity3 played @entity8 @entity0 believes that @entity2 is the answer to @entity6 's goalkeeping problems this season @entity6 's first - choice stopper @entity18 has appeared bereft of confidence throughout the season and his untidy footwork has hindered the passing movements that @entity23 likes to see his team build from defence			1
@entity26 replaced @entity18 in the side for what was intended to be an indefinite period before sustaining a thigh injury against @entity30 during the @entity32 fixtures			0
and with @entity23 enforcing a recruitment policy of young players with great potential , @entity0 believes 22 - year - old @entity2 would be a perfect signing at @entity37			1
' he 's young , he can only improve and , of course @entity6 is a big club and for him it would be a great chance to make it			0
' @entity26 did not impress many people when he replaced @entity18 in the @entity6 team @entity18 ( left ) keeps out a fierce strike from @entity45 striker @entity44 ( right ) @entity18 ( right ) comes out to punch away a cross into @entity6 's penalty area at @entity48 on saturday but @entity18 showed signs of a resurgence in form and belief in @entity6 's 2 - 0 win at @entity45 on saturday			2
he made a fantastic save to deny @entity44 with the score at 1 - 0 , before demonstrating the authority that he has rarely imposed this season by coming out to punch away the type of teasing delivery into the penalty area that has had him scrambling .			2

@entity2 impressed @entity0 as @entity3 beat @entity8 4 - 0 last week
the @entity1 goalkeeper believes @entity2 will get better if he *joins* @entity6
@entity2 is linked with a move to @entity37 from @entity67 side @entity66
