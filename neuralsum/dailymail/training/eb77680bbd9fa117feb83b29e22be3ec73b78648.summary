by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:54 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 18 july 2013 male - only golf clubs are ‘ for some people a way of life that they rather like ’ , the head of the sport ’s governing body insisted yesterday			1
@entity9 , chief executive of the @entity10 , said ahead of today ’s 142nd @entity11 at @entity12 in @entity13 , that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs			1
the @entity11 is being held at the famous course in @entity18 , where women are banned from being members - causing a controversy threatening to overshadow the competition			1
' a way of life ' : @entity9 , chief executive of the @entity10 , said ahead of today 's 142nd @entity11 at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity18 , that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs @entity18 ’s first minister @entity28 , culture secretary @entity29 and sport minister @entity30 have all announced they will boycott this week ’s golf for its perceived sexism			1
but mr @entity9 yesterday defended the course ’s ban on women , saying : ‘ i really do n’t think that a golf club that has a policy of being a place where like - minded men or indeed women go , play golf together and do their thing together , ranks up against some of these other forms of discrimination			1
‘ for some people , it is a way of life they rather like			0
i do n’t think they are intending to do others down			0
you can dress it up to be a lot more if you want			0
no women in sight : @entity56 's @entity55 , @entity57 and @entity56 's @entity58 on the 4th during practice day three for the @entity60 at @entity12 , @entity13 , on tuesday ‘ but if on a sunday morning the guy , or the lady , gets out of the marital bed , if you like , and plays golf with his chums and comes back in the afternoon - that is not on any kind of par with racial discrimination or anti-semitism			1
’ he added : ‘ we do believe that membership policy is a matter for clubs			2
and it will take a lot to push us off that position			0
we happen to believe that very strongly			0
’ but mr @entity9 was forced to concede that the issue of single - sex clubs would be re-examined			1
with the eyes of the world on @entity18 , mr @entity9 said it would be a ‘ hard push ’ to change the @entity10 ’s policy but accepted the issue of single - sex clubs had become ‘ divisive ’			1
he added : ‘ it ’s a subject that we ’re finding increasingly difficult , to be honest			0
single - sex clubs are in a very small minority in the @entity89			1
male - only club : golf fans make their way across the 18th fairway during practice day four for the @entity60 at @entity12 in @entity13 ' half of them are women - only , half are men - only			2
in our view , they do n’t do anyone any harm and we think the right of freedom of association is important			0
’ but he said he understood the view that three male - only clubs - @entity12 , @entity111 in @entity112 and @entity113 ’s in @entity114 - should not be listed among the nine courses which host the @entity11			2
at @entity12 , women can play only as a guest of a member or by booking tee - time in advance as a visitor			2
they have been banned by the @entity12 for 269 years			0
@entity121 , the most successful @entity89 woman player of modern times , said this week it was time @entity12 caught up with the 21st century			0
a @entity125 spokesman said : ‘ we conform to the @entity127 and any change in the membership would be for the members to decide			1
there are no plans to change the current membership status			0
’ @entity12 has brought the debate into the public mind as it is hosting the @entity11 this year			0
the club has a male - only policy @entity12 is a privately owned course which is the home of @entity12			0
established in 1744 in @entity139 , @entity18 , @entity12 has hosted @entity11 fifteen times , most recently in 2002 when @entity141 lifted the trophy			2
single - sex clubs are not illegal in @entity89 and exist in the golfing world and other sports and social situations but opponents have accused them of being outdated and out - of - touch			1
though women can play the course as guests or visitors they are barred from holding membership of @entity12			0
but one source told the @entity155 : ‘ the notion of women members is talked about openly now , rather than in whispers			2
it is not a case of if any longer , but when			0
’ the issue of single sex golf clubs has become huge in the golfing world , but the club maintains that its policy is to ask their members before changing			1
there are about 3,000 courses in @entity89			0
around about 1 % of them have a single sex membership policy			2
of that 1 % or so , half of them , slightly more than half , are women - only clubs in @entity176 these clubs were first formed , because they could n't get into the men 's clubs at that time supporters of single - sex clubs have said that members of these clubs do n't want to change			1
members of both men ’s and women ’s clubs are very happy with the policy			2
in april @entity9 said in a statement : ‘ why should perhaps 5,000 members of these various clubs change something that they 're very happy with ? ' and i do n't know who could make that happen , because the feeling is very strong here , that this works , this model here at @entity198 works			1

@entity9 insists that it 's not sexist to exclude women from clubs
open 2013 at @entity18 's @entity125 where women ca n't be members
@entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 are all boycotting event
mr @entity9 concedes that issue of single - sex clubs will be re-examined
@entity212 says that the ban should not be compared to racial discrimination
