will the same worm respond differently in a situation depending on what it is thinking ? according to new research studying neurons within microscopic roundworms , the answer is an emphatic ‘ yes ’			0
they found that worms would choose to respond to a nearby odour depending on what they were ‘ thinking ’ about - suggesting they have free will just like humans			1
the study was carried out by scientists at @entity17 in @entity18			1
they found roundworms ( pictured ) would sometimes ' think ' for themselves			1
all the neurons within this microscopic roundworm are highlighted , with the large cluster at one end representing the brain the research was carried out by scientists from the @entity17 in @entity18 who studied the brain of the microscopic roundworm @entity29			1
its 302 neurons and 7,000 synapses are comparatively tiny compared to the 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses in a human brain			0
but it is still useful to address tricky neurological questions that would be nearly impossible to broach in our own brains			0
worms spend their time wandering , looking for decomposing matter to eat - and when they smell it , they usually stop making random turns and travel straight toward the source			1
this change in behaviour is initially triggered by a sensory neuron that perceives the smell and feeds that information to the network the researchers studied			0
as the worms pick up the alluring fruity smell of isoamyl alcohol , the neurons in the network transition into a low activity state that allows them to approach the odour			1
but sometimes the neurons remain highly active , and the worm continues to wander around - even though its sensory neuron has detected the odour			1
they found that , if offered a ' delicious ' smell , the roundworm will usually stop its wandering to investigate the source - but sometimes it wo n’t			1
just as with humans , the same stimulus does not always provoke the same response , even from the same individual			1
‘ we found that the collective state of the three neurons at the exact moment an odour arrives determines the likelihood that the worm will move toward the smell , ’ said study author dr @entity73 ‘ so , in essence , what the worm is thinking about at the time determines how it responds			1
‘ it goes to show that nervous systems are n’t passively waiting for signals from outside , they have their own internal patterns of activity that are as important as any external signal when it comes to generating a behaviour			0
’ the researchers also found that by changing the activity of the neurons individually , and in combination , they could pinpoint each neuron ’s role in generating variability			1
in humans , the research may suggest ways in which our brains process competing motivations			1
' for humans , a hungry state might lead to you walk across the street to a delicious smelling restaurant , ' said author @entity111			1
' however , a competing aversion to the cold might lead you to stay indoors ' ( stock image ) by recording the activity of the neurons , the team found that there were three persistent states among the three neurons : all were off , all were on , or only one , called @entity122 , was on			2
if all were off when the odour signal arrived , they stayed off			2
if all were on , they often - but not always - shut off			2

and , in the third and most telling scenario , if @entity122 alone was active when the odour arrived , everything shut off			2
' this means that for @entity122 , context matters , ' continued author and research associate @entity111			0
@entity122 is the first neuron in the network to receive the signal , which it then relays to the other two network members , known as @entity144 and @entity145 ; @entity145 sends out the final instruction to the muscles			0

' this means that for @entity122 , context matters , ' continued author and research associate @entity111			0
' if it ’s on alone , its activity will drop when odour is added , but if it ’s on with the rest of the network , it has difficulty dropping its activity with the others			0

when the researchers shut off @entity144 and @entity145 individually and together , they found @entity122 ’s response to the odour signal improved			1
this suggests that input from these two neurons competes with the sensory signal as it feeds down through the network			0
scaled up to account for the more nuanced behaviours of humans , the research may suggest ways in which our brains process competing motivations			0

they found worms would sometimes ' think ' for themselves
if offered an odour , they would sometimes - but not always - investigate
even the same individual did not always have the same response
it suggests that like humans , the worms may have a sense of ' free will '
