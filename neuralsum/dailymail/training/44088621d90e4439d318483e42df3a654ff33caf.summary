by @entity0 a 90 - year - old woman was locked away and left to starve to death by her own children , police say			2
@entity5 survived a month of captivity in her bedroom by drinking water and eating a few porridge oats neighbours were able to throw in while her children were out			1
when police burst in at the end of last week to free her after a tip off posted online , her first words were : ' please , feed me , feed me			1
' horrific : ninety - year - old @entity5 is helped to wash after nearly a month in captivity with no food after her children allegedly hatched a plan to starve her to death because they were tired of caring for her her daughter and son are now facing charges of attempted murder after police accused them of ' a cold and calculating plan to get rid of someone they found expensive and tiresome to deal with '			1
a police spokesman said : ' the woman fell ill and to get rid of the problem of having to care for her , her children attempted to make her die from starvation in the locked room			0
' they did n't send their mother any food , telling her it was so she did n't need the bathroom , and would allow no - one in to see her			2
' @entity44 in @entity46 village in @entity47 , @entity48 , who realised mrs @entity50 was not being given much to eat were able on several occasions to pass oatmeal up to her through an open window			0
although they did not know that she was being given nothing , it is believed that one of them was the person who posted the anonymous online message which alerted police to her plight			1
emaciated : her daughter and son are now facing charges of attempted murder after police accused them of ' a cold and calculating plan to get rid of someone they found expensive and tiresome to deal with ' ' there had been friction between the old lady and her children for some time , ' said the police spokesman			1
' she was becoming an increasing burden to them and so they decided to kill her by starving her to death			0
' then they planned to tell the authorities that she simply stopped eating			0
' the spokesman added : ' this is not just a family dispute , but calculated murder			0
obviously , the selfish children wanted their mother to die to save them trouble of taking care of her			0

@entity5 survived thanks to neighbours who threw food to her window
she was only saved after an anonymous person posted a tip - off online
