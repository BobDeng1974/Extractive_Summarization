dozens of @entity2 mps are threatening to defy @entity3 by voting against plans for plain cigarette packets dozens of @entity2 mps are threatening to defy @entity3 by voting against plans for plain cigarette packets			1
@entity6 , a member of the prime minister ’s own policy advisory board , is leading the charge - warning it will be the ‘ final nail in the coffin ’ of hundreds of newsagents			1
rebels say around 40 conservative backbenchers may vote against what they regard as a nanny state measure			1
if that happens , it would dwarf this week ’s rebellion against the controversial @entity20 rail line			2
public health minister @entity21 announced last month ( april ) that shops would be forced to sell cigarettes in plan packaging within a year			2
fifty mps , most of them @entity2 , have signed a @entity27 motion against plain packaging - an indication of the scale of backbench anger			1
a large rebellion would be another sign of mr @entity3 ’s poor grip on party discipline			1
most famously , @entity37 reform - part of the @entity39 agreement with a @entity40 - had to be dropped when backbenchers refused to back it			0
as well as being one of the prime minister ’s advisers on the @entity46 , miss @entity6 is chairwoman of the all - party parliamentary group on small shops			2
last night she said : ‘ this is a very , very anti-conservative thing to do			0
‘ it is completely mad			0
plain packaging is a blunt instrument which will have a disproportionate impact on independent retailers			1
‘ all this will do is that it will boost the number of illicit cigarettes , meaning it will actually be easier for children to purchase them			0
’ @entity62 , another @entity2 backbencher , said : ‘ fifteen thousand people die of alcohol abuse every year , but are we going to have brown paper bags over alcohol bottles ? @entity6 , a member of the prime minister 's own policy advisory board , is leading the charge - warning it will be the ' final nail in the coffin ' of hundreds of newsagents ‘ this decision will simply increase the black market and create a new business in fancy cigarette cases , rather than dealing with the problem			1
’ miss @entity21 went for plain packaging after commissioning a report from former paediatrician sir @entity80 , which said there was ‘ very strong evidence ’ from @entity84 that plain packaging protects youngsters			1
no date has yet been set for a @entity27 vote on the policy			2
rebels hope their pressure will force the government into a u-turn before a vote is held			2
as well as being one of the prime minister 's @entity46 , miss @entity6 is chairwoman of the all - party parliamentary group on small shops in a letter to @entity101 magazine two weeks ago , miss @entity6 accused ministers of wishing to ‘ steamroll stricter tobacco controls and plain packaging through with no further debate or consideration , under the pretence that this will in some way prevent young people from taking up smoking ’			1
she said : ‘ plain packaging will serve to harm the very businesses that are best - placed to prevent underage sales and fight back against illegal and illicit supplies			1
‘ independent retailers are already being clobbered by the burdens of tobacco regulation			0
‘ next year , the point of sale display ban comes into effect for small shops , while over the next couple of years the provisions of the @entity124 ’s tobacco products directive will be felt by them			0
‘ packs of 10 and small pouches of roll - your - own tobacco under 20 grams are to be banned			0
these products already make up a sizeable share of newsagents ’ trade			0
‘ on top of this , the @entity124 is also demanding that at least 65 per cent of a cigarette packet contains picture and health warnings			0
‘ with so much of a cigarette packet already set to effectively become standardised with health warnings , the likelihood of the removal of remaining branding making a significant difference to reducing the prevalence of smoking is highly unlikely			0
’ she added : ‘ new plain packaging rules that go further than this would only serve to be another nail in the coffin for many newsagents			1
‘ we are a proud nation of shopkeepers , with newsagents forming the backbone of many local communities			0
‘ many are already struggling for survival , and unnecessary additional tobacco regulation should be avoided to help these businesses continue to serve their communities and create local jobs			0
’ on monday , 35 @entity2 mps voted against the government ’s plans for a high speed rail link from @entity171 to @entity172 .			2
