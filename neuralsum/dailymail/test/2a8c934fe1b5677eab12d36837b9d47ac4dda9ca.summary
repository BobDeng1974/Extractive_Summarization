men with advanced prostate cancer could benefit from a pioneering drug originally meant for women			1
clinical trials show that olaparib can delay the moment when the disease gets dangerously out of control			2
the drug already works for women with cancer fuelled by brca gene mutations , the defect that led to actress @entity13 having her ovaries removed			2
new ‘ exciting ’ new research suggests the drug , already used to treat women with breast cancer , could also help men with genetic faults within their prostate cancer ( pictured ) tumours up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours that have dna defects and these respond particularly well to olaparib			1
the @entity27 trial of olaparib , which is owned by @entity29 , was led by researchers at the @entity31 and the @entity32			0
they found 16 out of 49 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug , also known as @entity36			1
it stopped prostate cancer growth , generating lower tumour cell counts in the blood and improved responses in medical scans			1
the drug - called olaparib - can extend the length of time that a prostate cancer patient lives with the disease without it getting worse , according to new clinical trials			1
@entity49 is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations			1
it is one of the first of a new class of drugs called @entity58 inhibitors			0
@entity58 inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell ’s ability to repair damage			0
cancer cells that have a mutation in a brca gene rely completely on the @entity58 protein to fix the damage			0
@entity58 inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop @entity68 mutated cells from growing so they eventually die			0
side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only cancer cells with genetic defects are targeted			1
most of the men who had detectable dna repair mutations had disease control lasting much longer than expected			2
this suggests the men most likely to benefit from the drug could be identified by testing to look for mutations			2
@entity49 became the first of a new class of drugs called @entity58 inhibitors to be granted approval last month for use in ovarian cancer by the @entity89 and the @entity90			2
the inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell ’s ability to repair damage			0
cancer cells that have a mutation in a brca gene rely completely on the @entity58 protein to fix the damage			0
the inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop mutated cells from growing			0
side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only tumour cells with genetic defects are targeted			2
professor @entity103 , who was the trial chief investigator , said : ‘ this opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer , guided by genomic testing and based on the molecular characteristics of patients ’ tumours			1
' it shows that @entity58 inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought – in men as well as women , patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations , and in those with a wider range of gene defects			1
’ the drug , olaparib , is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations			1
it works by blocking the cancer cell ’s ability to repair damage dr @entity133 of the @entity31 said : ‘ we ’ve seen a significant improvement in the length of good quality life men can hope to live even with the most advanced prostate cancers			1
' these encouraging results show that olaparib could be the next drug to add to those already available			0
’ the results of the trial were presented at the @entity146 conference in @entity147			0
the @entity148 will now decide whether olaparib should become widely available on the @entity150			0
a decision is expected in september			0
dr @entity154 @entity153 said : ‘ we want to get to a stage where every man gets the treatment he needs for his specific cancer			0
’ researchers did not specify the length of time for which olaparib was able to stop advanced prostate cancer worsening .			1

@entity49 is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations
up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours with genetic defects - and they responded well to olaparib
