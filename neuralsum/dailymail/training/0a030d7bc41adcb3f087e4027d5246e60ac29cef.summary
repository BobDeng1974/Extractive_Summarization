former @entity1 hurdles champion @entity0 insists he should not have been suspended for having a banned substance in his system due to a contaminated supplement			1
@entity0 and fellow @entity6 @entity5 were ' at fault or negligent ' in failing to check supplements they took in an energy drink contained banned substances , according to a @entity14 ( @entity13 ) official report which was published on monday			1
the pair failed drugs tests last summer - forcing the athletes to miss both the @entity18 and the @entity19			2
although their bans were reduced as it was accepted they did not knowingly use banned substances , @entity0 , 30 , received a suspension of four months with @entity5 , 31 , banned for six months			1
@entity0 competing in the men 's 400m heats of the 2013 @entity28 @entity27 in 2013 both athletes are now clear to compete again after admitting their careers would have been over had the maximum four - year ban for serious cases of intentional doping been handed out , but @entity0 - who won @entity1 400m hurdles gold at @entity36 in 2012 - still feels he has done nothing wrong and that the punishment was harsh			1
' i have to accept what the suspension is but if you ask me i should n't have had one , ' @entity0 said			1
' they found something in my body that was a nanogram amount of a veterinary substance which stays in your body for nine months , so it was definitely not something a 400 - metre hurdler would take to get a performance			2
' it 's all bizarre and it 's impossible to foresee a small amount in a supplement that 's got labelling			2
' i think i 've already served more than enough punishment by missing the @entity18 and the @entity59			0
' but i 'm relieved now i can compete this season because i thought it could be the end of my athletics career , even though i 'd done nothing wrong			1
' @entity63 athlete @entity0 had just given a speech as @entity66 athletics team captain on the eve of the 2014 @entity18 in @entity68 when he was told he had tested positive for a banned substance			1
@entity0 can now return to action after having his ban reduced to four months the next day he was on the plane home from the team 's pre-games base in @entity76 , fighting to save his career and launching a campaign which he says has cost him Â£ 100,000 when you add up legal fees and loss of track earnings and sponsorship			1
' i 've never cried so much in my life and it also left my wife and coach in tears , it 's been very upsetting for the whole family , ' said @entity0 , the son of @entity66 rugby legend @entity90			1
' i do n't think any athlete realises how bad it can be until it happens to you			2
' what i do n't want is people to associate me with drugs as i 've proved where the cross-contamination has come from , but i know some people wo n't care about the facts			2
' @entity103 my name now and the first thing that comes up is doping			0
' i 've been in the @entity105 senior team since 2005 and done a lot of good things but this has ruined my reputation and that 's what i am trying to get back			0
' i want to turn this whole thing into a positive and educate athletes in not making the same mistake , because if it can happen to me who 's done all the physical checks then it can happen to anyone			0
' fellow @entity6 @entity119 was also banned for six months for inadvertently taking a supplement @entity0 says he is now focused on resuming his track career ahead of this year 's @entity122 in @entity123 but , like @entity5 , admits he will not be using supplements in the future			1
' @entity14 have got to be seen to set an example and something was found in my body , ' @entity0 said			1
' i ca n't deny that and i 've accepted that , but thankfully i 've proved where the cross-contamination has come from			0
' my aim now is to get back in that @entity105 team , do well at the @entity122 and then look at the @entity135 in @entity136			0
' @entity5 said his suspension was two months longer than @entity0 ' because he was told he had not made as many checks on the supplement concerned as his international colleague			1
the 800m runner from @entity142 said he was not bothered about the finger of suspicion being pointed at him and insisted he was a clean athlete			0
' everyone who knows us has been behind us and knows we have n't done anything wrong , ' said @entity5 , who competed for @entity147 at the @entity148			1
' it wo n't affect me			0
people can say what they want but my shoulders are broad and i 'll concentrate on my own career			0
' it 's been a nightmare six months and it 's cost a ridiculous amount of money to clear my name			0
' but i would have paid anything to do that because i do n't want people thinking i 'm a cheat			0
' @entity13 director of legal @entity163 said in a statement : ' these cases send a powerful reminder to athletes that there is no guarantee that any supplement product is free from banned substances			2
' athletes are strongly advised to be very cautious if they choose to use any supplement product and must undertake thorough research of any products before use			0
' information revealed as a result should be further investigated and we advise athletes to keep evidence of their research			0
' the principle of strict liability dictates athletes are responsible for any substance found in their body			0

@entity0 was banned for taking a contaminated supplement
@entity0 given four - month ban and @entity5 six - month ban
both took the contaminated supplements unknowingly
@entity0 believes he ' should n't have been suspended for *offence*
he thought his athletics career was at its ' end ' after suspension
