by @entity0 @entity2 's distinctive rising sun tattoo was conspicuously missing when her controversial @entity4 ad aired during the @entity5			1
the actress has a multi-colored rising sun tattoo on her inside left forearm , and though it would have only been visible for a quick second of the ad , it was very clearly missing			2
it is unknown whether the tattoo was covered up with makeup or airbrushed out after the fact , but there is speculation that the meaning behind that tattoo could have caused problems with @entity4 executives			1
missing : @entity2 's inner left forearm is shown during a brief moment of the 30 - second @entity4 ad , but her tattoo is conspicuously missing normal : she regularly displays her brightly colored rising sun tattoo on her inner left forearm at events though the 28 - year - old identifies as @entity33 , but goes against the religion 's mandate that forbids followers from having tattoos			1
though she turned into somewhat of a lightning rod for controversy with the spot , many praised the selection of @entity2 as the @entity45 company 's first global spokesperson			1
it is unclear who mandated that her tattoos were ' erased ' from the ad - whether it was @entity2 or the company executives - and @entity53 's calls were not immediately returned			2
not only is her colorful rising sun tattoo from her inner left forearm mysteriously missing , but so is the rosary bead bracelet she has on one wrist and the small interlacing circles on her inner ankle			0
for much of the 30 - second spot , she was covered in a bathrobe , in the final moments , she takes off the robe to show that she is wearing a form - fitting black dress			0
during that reveal , her left arm is is shown and there is no visible tattoo			0
part of her off - screen persona : @entity2 rarely covers up the tattoos when she is not working both sides : the rosary tattoo that she has on her right wrist was also gone from the ad causing pause : @entity4 , an @entity45 company , was praised for picking a @entity33 global ambassador but the faith also prohibits followers from getting tattoos the same is true of her right wrist , as it is visible when she demonstrates how to use @entity4 but there is no rosary bracelet visible at the time			1
this is not the first time that her tattoos have been removed during an ad campaign , as her tattoos are also conspicuously missing when she posed as a pin - up for a @entity95 make up ad			0
the motivation behind removing her tattoo is just the latest controversy relating to the multi-million dollar ad , since the company 's use of @entity105 factories led to her decision to drop her ambassadorship with @entity109 since the children 's charity opposes work in the occupied territory			0
not the first time : @entity2 's tattoos have been removed in other ad campaigns as well			0

actress has multiple tattoos that were not shown in the @entity5 spot
@entity33 religious *doctrine* bans tattoos , and though she identifies as @entity33 that has *n't* *stopped* her from getting inked
@entity4 is an @entity45 company and picked her as a global ambassador in part because of her religious identity
