by @entity0 one in 10 @entity2 supporters say they will not switch their vote at the election in order to keep @entity6 out just one in 10 @entity2 supporters would consider switching their vote to keep @entity6 out of @entity8 , a major new poll revealed yesterday			1
the study by the former @entity11 deputy chairman @entity10 found that most supporters of the anti-eu party do not believe to @entity15 's warning that they risk wrecking hopes of an @entity13 referendum by aiding a @entity19 victory			1
the finding is a major blow to the @entity22 who fear a strong showing for @entity2 in next year 's general election could cost them dozens of seats			1
the @entity22 ' @entity2 , get @entity19 ' - or ' @entity27 , get @entity6 ' slogan is expected to play a key role in the party 's strategy next year			1
but the new study of 2,300 @entity2 supporters found that that just over half ( 51 per cent ) disagreed with the statement ' a vote for @entity2 makes the prospect of @entity6 becoming prime minister more likely '			1
almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) agreed they might inadvertently help @entity19 into power but said they did not care			1
just 10 per cent said they would consider changing their vote to keep mr @entity6 out			1
the figure was slightly higher among voters who had defected from the @entity22 in the first place , with 14 per cent saying they would consider switching back next year			2
lord @entity10 said the results showed that the @entity11 message needs ' spelling out ' to voters who may spend little time thinking about the intricacies of the @entity51 electoral system			2
he said the @entity22 needed to learn the lessons of the last election when they faced a similar challenge in trying to persuade voters that a vote for the @entity57 was likely to result in a hung @entity58			2
he said : ' again , it seemed so obvious as hardly to need stating that the more @entity22 there were in the @entity61 , the greater the chance of a new administration			0
' but this message was harder to get across than you might think			0
' lord @entity10 insisted that the poll findings were not a disaster for the @entity11 , adding : ' if one in seven @entity11 - @entity2 defectors might be persuaded to reconsider on the spot by this argument , that is not a failure			1
' with marginal voters in marginal seats , the margins matter			0
' the news will be a boost to @entity80 leader @entity79 ( left ) and troubling to @entity15 ( right ) as the mantra ' @entity2 , get @entity19 ' is expected to be part of @entity11 election campaigning next year but the findings are likely to dismay @entity11 strategists who fear they will be wiped out in a string of marginal seats unless they succeed in winning back a much higher proportion of voters who have defected to @entity2			1
@entity89 believes that mr @entity6 's recent decision to all - but rule out an @entity92 referendum on @entity93 has strengthened their anti-ukip message by making it clear that only the @entity11 will deliver a referendum			0
but the new poll underlines the scale of the challenge facing the @entity11			2
the new study also looked at wider public attitudes to @entity93 , based on a poll of more than 20,000 people			0
it found that @entity51 was split down the middle on the @entity93 question , with 41 per cent wanting to stay in and 41 per cent wanting to leave			2
almost one - fifth of voters ( 19 per cent ) were classified as having a ' committed hostility ' to @entity93			0
this group of mainly older , white voters saw immigration as the most important issue facing @entity51 , ranking it even higher than the economy			0
a larger group ( 27 per cent ) were classified as discontented sceptics '			0
almost 90 per cent said they believed the costs of @entity13 membership outweigh the benefits			1
@entity120 found @entity51 split on @entity93 , with 41 per cent wanting to stay and 41 per cent in favour of leaving a further quarter ( 26 per cent ) were classed as ' relaxed status quo '			1
they tended to be younger voters with higher qualifications			0
their main concerns focused on jobs and the economy , with @entity93 the least important issue in their lives			0
another 12 per cent were classed as ' global progressives '			0
they were more likely to work in the public sector and twice as likely to vote @entity19			1
they valued the freedom to travel and trade			0
almost a third said they saw no real drawbacks to @entity13 membership			2
a further 15 per cent were classified as ' disengaged '			0
this group comprised mainly young , working class women			0
more than 80 per cent do not have a clear view on the costs and benefits of @entity13 membership .			1

tories have been warning that voting @entity2 will hand @entity19 victory
however poll reveals that just one in 10 would swap their vote
showed 41 per cent favour leaving @entity13 , and 41 per cent back staying
