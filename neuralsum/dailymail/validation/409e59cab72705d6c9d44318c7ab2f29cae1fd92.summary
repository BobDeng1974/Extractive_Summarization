the doomed @entity0 was taken on an emotional ‘ last farewell ’ fly - past of the pilot ’s home island of @entity5 before being deliberately landed on the water and sinking intact thousands of miles away , according to a @entity9 pilot who claims to have identified its final resting place			1
the unusual overflying of @entity5 is ‘ perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator ’ he says			1
the theory of @entity17 , a senior @entity18 captain with a major commercial airline , has gained support from one of @entity9 ’s top flight safety specialists , @entity21 of the respected @entity24 magazine and flightglobal website			1
he has concluded that the search in the vast @entity41 being conducted by the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) is about 100 nautical miles away from the where the aircraft actually is			1
he also believes the riddle of the aircraft ’s odd dog - leg flight path immediately after take - off from @entity44 is down to the aircraft performing a final ‘ fly - past ’ of @entity52 ’s @entity5 island to allow someone to have ‘ a last emotional look			1
’ captain @entity17 notes from his research that the captain of the lost @entity18 777 - 200 , @entity54 , came from @entity5 , while first officer @entity0 was from @entity56			1
details are reported in the @entity59			0
captain @entity17 says that after taking off from @entity27 at 16.41 gmt on march 7 last year , flight @entity0 lost contact with air traffic control at a point over the @entity64 where four flight information regions intersect			1
the last verbal contact had been at 19.19 and the captain ’s was the last voice heard			2
captain @entity17 said the flight did something ‘ quite remarkable ’ by flying in and out of the airspace of @entity52 and @entity74 eight times noting : ’ i ’ve never seen anything like that but it is a good way to cause confusion between the controllers			1
’ the captain of the lost @entity18 777 - 200 , @entity54 , left , came from @entity5 , while first officer @entity0 was from @entity56 , right missing : searchers scouring huge swathes of the world 's oceans for the jet have so far found no sign of it after flying along the border the passenger jet performed a sharp u-turn towards @entity5 , one of three turns made in quick succession			2
' it took me months to work out what this was			0
' the clue was @entity99 , ’ he said referring to the giant natural feature and landmark in the heart of @entity103			0
' i have done the same manoeuvre there , to look down and get a great view			0
somebody was taking a last emotional look at @entity5			0
’ he explained : ’ i thought of this at 5am , went downstairs and researched where the air crew were from			0
’ noting that pilot @entity54 was from @entity5 while co-pilot @entity113 was from @entity56 , he said : ‘ someone did a nice long turn and looked down on @entity5			2
it ’s perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator			2
’ military radar gave the last fix of the flight at 18.22 gmt heading @entity122 towards the navigation waypoint @entity124			0
it then flew straight for thousands of miles before , it is believed , ending up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of @entity103			0
@entity103 investigators believe the plane crashed			0
but captain @entity17 believes it was deliberately landed on the water and then sank intact close to a trench in the sea – explaining why no wreckage has ever been found			2
@entity103 investigators said they had been in touch with captain @entity17 and described his theory as ‘ credible			1
’ flight magazine ’s mr @entity21 said : ‘ since capt @entity17 revealed in @entity143 his calculations about where @entity0 is likely to have come to rest , the @entity42 – leading the @entity0 search team – has spoken at length to him			1
‘ despite worldwide interest in his work , nobody – yet – has suggested his calculations are anything but logical and mathematically sound			0

theory of @entity17 , a senior @entity18 captain , has gained support from one of @entity9 ’s top flight safety specialists
@entity157 of @entity5 is ‘ perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator ’ he says
