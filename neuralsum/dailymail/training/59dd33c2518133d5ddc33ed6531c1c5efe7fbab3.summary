tens of thousands of teenagers are avoiding being punished for crimes by simply saying sorry – even to girls they have raped			2
figures obtained by @entity6 show that more than 30,000 young people who admitted crimes including sexual assault , violence , possession of hard drugs and carrying guns have escaped prosecution over the past year			1
instead , they have just apologised or tried to make amends			0
it means they do not have to go to court , risk jail or a fine , and do not receive a criminal record			0
hard time : supporters of restorative justice say it frees up space in crowded prisons and stops first - time offenders from descending into a life of crime			1
but it is being used for violent and sexual offences supporters of the initiative , known as restorative justice or community resolution , claim it is a fairer way to deal with first - time offenders while still giving closure to those they have wronged			1
but critics fear it allows young thugs to get away with serious crimes			2
@entity43 , @entity45 ’s @entity44 , said : ‘ it is disturbing that restorative justice is being used for indictable offences including sexual assault			1
’ since last april , the @entity50 has required police forces to submit statistics on informal resolution , and this is the first time such detailed figures have been released			0
deaf student @entity56 , 21 , said the boy who came to apologise for egging her home smirked statistics from 40 @entity61 forces show that between april 2013 and january this year , 37,168 offences by under - 18s were dealt with informally			2
over the same period , 43,188 youths were prosecuted			0
guidance from the @entity66 says it is risky to deal informally with crimes such as domestic abuse or sexual assault because of the risk of further offences			1
the figures , however , show that 222 sexual offences were dealt with by community resolution			1
in the past two years , @entity75 and @entity76 have dealt informally with three teenage rapes , while @entity78 have done the same with four rapes in the past year			1
in addition , 11,436 acts of violence were resolved in this way , including serious offences of wounding			2
there were 13 incidents of assaults on police , and dozens of public order , harassment , racist abuse and even threats to kill			0
at least 152 young people were caught with weapons such as knives yet spared prosecution , and at least six when they had guns			2
common uses of restorative justice include shoplifting and criminal damage , with youths apologising to shopkeepers or painting over graffiti			1
but the alternative was also used in 2,436 cases of drug possession , some involving ecstasy and ketamine			0
some of the activities ordered have been criticised as too soft			0
in @entity117 , three boys who stole a cancer sufferer ’s bike were told to take part in a charity run			0
in @entity123 , an 11 - year - old who stole swan ’s eggs had to ‘ learn more about wildlife ’			2
some victims have also questioned the measures			0
deaf student @entity56 agreed to restorative justice after a 13 - year - old boy mocked her and pelted her home with eggs			1
police took the yob to her home near @entity134 to apologise , but @entity56 , 21 , said : ‘ he did n’t give a damn			0
i still have to get a lift to university rather than catch the bus so i can avoid him			0
’ a spokesman for charity the @entity143 said : ‘ the scheme has been shown to reduce reoffending by 14 per cent , and four out of five victims would recommend it			1

supporters say restorative justice is a good way to treat first offenders
but it is used after crimes of sexual assault , violence , drugs and guns
222 sexual offences dealt with in past year including seven rapes
@entity143 says *technique* reduces reoffending by 14 *%*
