something to hide ? professor @entity0 has had time off to campaign against a free press - but who has paid his salary ? hacked off co-founder and university professor @entity0 yesterday faced questions about who is paying his salary while he campaigns for state - imposed regulation of the @entity2			1
the executive director of the lobby group – fronted by actor @entity11 – has been on leave of absence from his academic job for nine months			1
but the man whose organisation is demanding greater openness and transparency from newspapers refuses to say whether the taxpayer is funding his sabbatical			1
mr @entity0 , 56 , professor of journalism at @entity22 , is understood to be receiving around two - thirds of his estimated £ 80,000 - a - year salary while he runs the high - profile pressure group that is demanding statutory legislation of the @entity2			1
during his time off he has played a key public role for the organisation and was one of four hacked off representatives who sat in on controversial late - night talks in @entity34 ’s commons office when the controversial @entity35 on newspaper regulation was agreed by the three political parties			2
hacked off has consistently defied calls to identify its donors			2
earlier this year the lobby group refused to tell mps the names of the rich individuals bankrolling its fight for a @entity2 law and professor @entity0 was criticised by the audience at a @entity51 literary festival when he refused to name its backers			1
over several days , the @entity53 has made detailed requests to professor @entity0 , hacked off and @entity22 , in @entity55 , to reveal whether the taxpayer is funding his sabbatical but they have refused to answer			1
last night @entity58 , chief executive of the @entity59 ’ @entity57 , said : ‘ any suggestion that taxpayers have paid for @entity0 to work for @entity62 is deeply worrying and requires explanation			1
‘ it ’s vital that those involved come clean about whether hard - pressed families are funding mr @entity0 ’s time lobbying for press regulation			1
‘ @entity62 ’s campaign has resulted in vital press freedoms being threatened			1
if this work has been subsidised by taxpayers it will only add to the scandal			0
’ on professor @entity0 ’s @entity22 website it says : ‘ @entity0 joined the university as one of its founding members of the journalism department in 2003 , and has watched student numbers grow to 300 in that time			1
major players : @entity83 has made a £ 5,000 donation to the pressure group hacked off , which is fronted by @entity11 ‘ he was made a professor in 2006 , and teaches at all three levels on the journalism ba course			1
’ messages sent to his university email address received the reply : ‘ @entity0 is on leave of absence from @entity22 from september 2012			1
’ the hacked off campaign was launched by the @entity97 in july 2011 in the wake of the @entity100 phone - hacking scandal			2
the professor and the trust ’s @entity102 co-founded the lobby group , which represents celebrities and other victims of press intrusion			2
during his leave of absence from the university ’s school of humanities , professor @entity0 has been prominent in reacting to the @entity114 report and has frequently appeared in print and on tv and radio demanding greater newspaper regulation			1
hacked off has come under increasing pressure to disclose the source of its funds			2
heiress @entity83 confirmed she had given £ 5,000 to the group fronted by her ex-boyfriend mr @entity11 and last month financier @entity125 and chart - topping music producer @entity126 were named as secret donors			1
chief : hacked off have continued to campaign through @entity130 's inquiry into press regulation on its website the only funding hacked off discloses is money from mr @entity11 , a £ 50,000 grant over 2012 - 13 from the @entity137 and more than £ 20,000 it says it is soon to receive from the @entity138 , a charitable body set up by the owners of the independent newspapers			1
@entity22 had an income of £ 203million in 2011/12 with £ 73million of the cash coming in public money provided by government funding and £ 98million in tuition fees and education @entity147 university said the @entity149 prevented it from discussing professor @entity0 ’s absence			1
the @entity53 made repeated efforts to speak to professor @entity0 without success			2
a series of questions was sent to hacked off about his year off and his salary arrangements , including whether mr @entity0 thought his work with the lobby group was a suitable use of a sabbatical funded by the taxpayer			1
hacked @entity162 replied : ‘ professor @entity0 is currently on leave of absence from @entity22 and working as executive director of @entity62			1
‘ his salary is a private matter			2
he , the university and the government all take the view that , where possible , academics should contribute to society and to public life			2
’ by @entity174 secret : @entity130 with the report from the @entity177 , practices and @entity179 has refused to discuss his findings the judge who chaired the public inquiry into the newspaper industry is refusing requests to appear in front of mps to discuss his report and the future of the @entity2			0
the @entity53 has been told that over the last six months @entity130 has received several invitations from the @entity190 to face questions at a special parliamentary hearing			0
sources say @entity130 , who delivered his report into media standards last november , is ‘ well aware ’ that the committee is keen to scrutinise him publicly over which of the proposals under discussion he believes would deliver the best system of press regulation , but all offers have so far been rebuffed			0
it is unlikely that other aspects of the @entity114 – including the controversial relationship between @entity207 , a lawyer working on @entity130 ’s team , and @entity210 , a barrister acting for celebrity phone - hacking victims – could be examined because of restrictions set out by the @entity214 on judges commenting on public figures			2
the pair struck up a close friendship while the @entity130 inquiry was under way , going on holiday together to a @entity223 island last august			0
they deny their affair began before the inquiry ended in december , but critics believe they may have breached official guidelines by becoming so close last summer			0
@entity229 , the media select committee ’s chairman , has been in regular contact with the lord chief justice , lord judge , since last december about the possibility of @entity130 appearing though so far no formal summons has been made			0
lord judge , in effect @entity130 ’s boss , must give his permission before the judge can make an appearance			0
official guidelines do not forbid sitting judges from appearing in front of select committees but they do limit their ability to discuss certain matters , including ‘ the personalities or merits of ... politicians , and other public figures ... ’ as well as individual legal cases			0
but the rules say nothing about judges who have led public inquiries , and the committee is ready to toughen its stance in order to force @entity130 to attend a hearing so that his views can be considered			0
a source said : ‘ it is surely an irony that sir @entity130 is the only person associated with this public inquiry from whom the public have not heard			0
‘ he was asked by the government to lead a public inquiry			0
he did so at considerable public expense			0
admittedly we ’ve moved on from the recommendations he made in his report last year but this is very much a live issue for the committee , who would be very , very interested to hear from him			0
’ @entity276 mp @entity275 said : ‘ it is ridiculous that @entity130 should be excused from sharing his thoughts in public on the crucial matter of the future of the @entity2			0
’ the newspaper industry is still locked in a stalemate with the government over how it should be regulated			0
a spokesman for the @entity286 said : ‘ the chairman of the select committee has spoken to the lord chief justice , who has concerns about @entity130 ’s position			0
the chairman has told the lord chief justice he understands those concerns and together they are considering how best to meet them			0
