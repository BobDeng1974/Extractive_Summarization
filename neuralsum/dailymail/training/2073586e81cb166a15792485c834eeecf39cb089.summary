a species of mosquito capable of transmitting a deadly disease have been found thriving on marshes in the @entity4			2
colonies of culex modestus , which can spread the @entity8 virus in one bite , have been discovered by scientists at sites across @entity12			1
the virus , which killed 286 people in @entity15 in 2012 , can cause flu - like symptoms that last several days , and in serious cases can cause swelling of the brain and spinal cord			0
experts from @entity23 have collected samples of the species at wetland sites across north @entity27 - including two on the @entity29			0
a call for risk assessments to be updated has since been sparked after the killer insect was found thriving on the island , which is largely marshland on the @entity4			0
according to an article published in the @entity43 and vectors journal , an average of 27.97 adult mosquitoes were caught each night at a barn and a field in @entity49 and an average of 26.17 of them – nearly 94 per cent – were culex modestus			1
dr @entity53 , from @entity23 , said : ‘ @entity54 seems to exploit the ditches in the north @entity27 marshes , and owing to the large number of wild birds and farm animals , there is sufficient blood source to sustain populations			0
’ but the @entity8 virus disease , and the similar @entity65 virus , were not detected in any samples taken in the study			1
however , the scientists behind the study have warned the abundance of the insets highlights the need to look again at it potentially reaching the @entity72			0
there have only been four cases confirmed in the @entity72 since 2002 - three in people returning from @entity15 and one in a person returning from the @entity78 - and no one has ever contracted the disease in the @entity72			0
the mosquito can be found in many parts of the world including @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , and unlike other species , it is not tropical			0
mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds and can then spread the virus to humans and other animals they bite			2
the virus can not be spread from close person - to - person contact - for example , by kissing someone who is infected			2
although migratory birds , which are also monitored , are known to land on @entity29 after returning from warmer countries , so far none has been known to carry @entity8 virus here			1
it is not certain how culex modestus reached the area , and previous surveys between 2001 and 2003 found no reported evidence of it being here			1
its population in the region appears to be increasing as a previous study from 2010 reported 75 per cent of adult mosquitoes were culex modestus			2
the @entity8 virus , pictured , which killed 286 people in @entity15 in 2012 , can cause flu - like symptoms that last several days , and in serious cases can cause swelling of the brain and spinal cord the latest survey , carried out during the peak months of july to september in 2013 , showed the species accounting for 90 per cent of all samples collected on the marshes			1
but this could be down to numbers varying from year to year depending on the weather			0
dr @entity53 added : ‘ this species is recognised as a potential vector of @entity8 virus , and that is why increased survey effort has targeted the region			1
' last year , public health experts ramped - up efforts to detect mosquitoes capable of carrying potentially lethal diseases by building detection stations at ferry ports in @entity140			0
experts fear the culex modestus and @entity144 tiger mosquito , which can spread dengue fever , may enter the country due to the increasingly mild conditions .			1

culex modestus have been discovered by scientists 50 miles from @entity151
*invasive* mosquito can spread the deadly @entity8 virus in one bite
there is currently no vaccine , which can lead to fatal form of @entity34
