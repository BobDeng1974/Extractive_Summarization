goal : @entity5 53 , @entity64 62 referee : @entity83 ( @entity84 ) 6.5 attendance : 26,848 * ratings by @entity87 at @entity42 ‘ i ’ve made my intentions clear , i want to stay on , to carry on working with the first team , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ i will find out by the end of the week			2
we are off on monday , but we are back in on tuesday and we ’ll about it talk then			2
‘ it is inevitable clubs will be looking at our best players and it will be difficult to keep them , while one or two will be looking to leave			0
‘ but we want to keep as many as we can because we want to have a proper crack at coming straight back up			0
’ with @entity99 available to work again after dropping his legal case against @entity102 chief @entity101 and @entity103 set to be on the market following his expected dismissal as @entity107 manager , @entity8 ’ chances look slim			2
@entity8 ’ job prospects are unlikely to register in @entity7 ’s thoughts this week , however			2
he has bigger fish to fry ; victory at @entity112 on saturday would provide the perfect stage for the @entity114 , whose existing deal expires next week , to announce he is staying on for an another two years			2
@entity7 underlined his intention to sign a new contract on sunday , strongly rejecting the notion he could quit the @entity119 for @entity120 ahead of next season			0
down and out : @entity20 will be playing their football in the championship next season cheers anyway : @entity53 applauds the @entity20 fans after defeat in their final top - flight game i 'll be over there : @entity69 started on the bench for @entity6 but came on with just over an hour gone he 's back : @entity69 made his comeback from injury as a second - half substitute against @entity20 @entity69 proved his fitness for @entity135 with a second - half cameo for @entity6 that will ease @entity138 ’s fears			1
the @entity140 boss would also have been encouraged by the performance of @entity43			2
the @entity20 goalkeeper made several excellent saves to ensure his side were n’t embarrassed on the final day of the season			1
‘ i wish @entity120 well , but there is no interest there , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ today was a good basis to prepare for the cup final			2
the fact we got 79 points is proof that we have made progress			0
‘ unfortunately it ’s the first time a club finishes fourth with 79 points			0
it was a tight @entity18			0
@entity160 , @entity161 and us can be frustrated , the number of points made by the top teams is top quality			0
‘ whoever wins it deserves it , but @entity166 just got over the line without the brilliance they showed at the start of the season			0
they came from behind after having three games in hand			0
’ with @entity20 ’s relegation into the championship virtually secured and @entity6 ’s @entity178 qualification sealed , there was n’t much to invigorate the players ahead of kick - off			1
on the run : @entity64 enjoyed his goal as @entity6 won their final game of the season meet and greet : @entity7 was pictured with actor @entity186 before @entity6 played @entity20 and it showed as the clash got off to a subdued start , with the first effort of real note arriving in the 18th minute when @entity63 - making his first league start of the season - parried @entity48 ’s long range effort			1
the home side had @entity43 to thank for not going in a half - time well behind as the @entity140 goalkeeper made three brilliant stops to deny @entity73 and @entity74 - his stop to thwart the @entity114 ’s first effort particularly eye - catching			0
the largely dour first - half was all forgotten in the 53rd minute , when @entity5 smashed home an exceptionally well - executed volley from 14 yards after @entity74 ’s pinpoint cross to put @entity6 ahead			1
on the run : @entity6 's @entity205 playmaker @entity72 goes past @entity206 tussle : @entity6 's @entity70 gets the better of @entity53 during the first half at @entity42 no holding back : @entity40 midfielder @entity5 puts a challenge in on @entity54 double trouble : @entity52 is closed down by @entity6 midfielders @entity68 and @entity5 nine minutes later the @entity40 doubled their lead through the unlikeliest of scorers , @entity64 slotting home @entity67 ’ cut back to score his first goal for the club			1
the right back , who grew up as a devoted @entity6 fan , celebrated like he had just scored the winner in saturday ’s cup final at @entity112 , not a meaningless clash at @entity42			1
it was a fairytale moment , and there were more positives as @entity69 made his return after an eight - week injury lay - off while @entity71 made his first appearance in 14 months following a serious knee injury			0
@entity7 will be hoping for more good times on saturday			0
chilly in may , @entity7 ? @entity40 boss @entity7 had a towel over his knees as he sat on the bench at @entity42 @entity40 : @entity64 ( left ) and @entity74 ( right ) help @entity5 celebrate his opener getting stuck in : @entity53 and @entity73 battle for the ball ... and he 's off : @entity73 wins this one as he gets away from @entity53 hard to beat : @entity20 keeper @entity43 pulls off a smart save to deny @entity73			1
