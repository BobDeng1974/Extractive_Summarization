a 20 minute delay in the rescue of a scuba diver who drowned off the @entity5 coast has caused a row between lifeboat services			1
@entity8 , 49 , ran into difficulty 60 ft underwater while diving 17 miles out to sea on friday			1
when he surfaced unconscious , a distress call was made while mr @entity8 was given cpr			2
but the coastguard who took the distress call has been accused of ignoring a local lifeguard service in favour of a helicopter that took 40 minutes to reach the scene - a decision which cost 20 minutes			1
although the delay was not the difference between life and death for mr @entity8 , who could not have been saved even by the closer boast , the overlooked @entity23 lifeboat service has hit out at the decision to use slower alternatives to answer a distress call			1
overlooked : the independent @entity23 lifeboat , pictured , was closest to mr @entity8 but was not sent out by the @entity32 @entity32 , who co-ordinated the rescue , sent an @entity36 boat from @entity37 , @entity5 , and a helicopter from @entity39 , instead of using the @entity41 lifeboat service , whose base in @entity44 , @entity5 , was closest to the scene			1
the helicopter was called at 1.20pm but did not arrive for almost 40 minutes			1
mr @entity8 , a plasterer from @entity48 , @entity49 was then airlifted to @entity50 in @entity5 , and pronounced dead on arrival			2
an inquest later found that he had drowned			0
but in the wake of his death the leader of the @entity41 service has claimed they could have been there in half the time			1
rescue : a coastguard helicopter took 40 minutes to reach mr @entity8 , 49 ( file photo ) @entity63 , the chairman of the @entity41 service , said that the @entity36 base was six miles further along the coast , meaning their boat took substantially longer to arrive , according to @entity68 ‘ we could have been there 15 to 20 minutes before any other craft – helicopter or boat			1
and when you ’ve got someone who very sadly died on the boat , you need help straightaway			0
when a boat puts a mayday out they want someone there now			0
‘ we ’ve got the fastest boat in the country , and a 250 - mile radius			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity36 said : ‘ the @entity36 is co-ordinated by the coastguard			0
we respond when we are paged and launch as soon as possible			0
‘ overall responsibility for which assets go to each rescue is for them to decide			0
’ a spokesman for the coastguard defended their decision to send a helicopter to mr @entity8 rather than the closer lifeboat			2
she said : ‘ in an incident off @entity44 on friday 30th august , @entity97 was contacted by a dive vessel reporting that one of their divers had surfaced and was in difficulty			0
‘ the incident occurred 17 miles offshore and the decision was made to send the @entity106 search and rescue helicopter from @entity107 as this was the quickest way to get the casualty to hospital			2
‘ the @entity36 all - weather lifeboat was also requested to launch to assist with the transportation of the dive buddy , particularly in view of the distance offshore			0

@entity8 , 49 , ran into difficulty diving off the @entity5 coast
coastguard dispatched a rescue helicopter which took 40 minutes to arrive
@entity41 lifeboat service claims they could have been there in half the time
