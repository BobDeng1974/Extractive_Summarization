' we do about one a week , 50 a year			2
they 're coming in here as fast as i can fix them			2
there 's about 3,000 in the @entity134 and we look after a good proportion of those			0
' it was a very popular car			0
at one point , half the cars in the world were @entity76			0
they 're affordable , usable and repairable , even though they are 100 years old			1
' it 's more leisurely than a modern car			0
its cruising speed is 30mph , at 40mph you 're starting to rattle and to hit 45mph you 'd have to be going downhill with the wind behind you			0

i 'm about to go to @entity198 with a @entity200 group - there 's ten of us touring for a week in the @entity204			1
' i 've seen a lot of the @entity134 that i would never have seen if i was n't driving an old car			0
' thing of beauty : the @entity4 is an icon , but with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers can not get anywhere very fast @entity212 may have invented the petrol engine , but it was @entity5 , a @entity217 - @entity216 farmer used his genius to realise its social potential			1
