by @entity0 published : 00:19 est , 29 september 2012 updated : 13:17 est , 29 september 2012 @entity1 was in a @entity3 state of mind last night as he performed an inaugural sold - out concert at the borough ’s new @entity5 to uproarious response			1
but the star - studded opening was tarnished in part due to protests that had taken place throughout the day , gathering in front of the grey domed arena which one person said resembled ‘ @entity16 ’s old lumpy mattress			1
’ three women with scales in their hands wore signs reading ‘ @entity23 ’ in front of the $ 1billion arena			1
many of the protestors who showed up were concerned that the new venue will mean overwhelming congestion and noise for nearby residents			1
‘ what we need is two - bedroom , three - bedroom units that are affordable , ’ @entity52 executive director @entity51 said			1
‘ they have skewed what is needed			2
’ the use of eminent domain also meant that residents were forced out of the area			1
hundreds more will likely notice the cost of living will creep up , due to the proximity to @entity66			2
similarly , @entity67 , a spokesperson for @entity69 do n’t destroy @entity3 , rallied people ahead of the opening saying that @entity66 was a ‘ monument to crazy capitalism , ’ according to the @entity74			1
@entity1 said that performing in his hometown was better than performing at the @entity76 , @entity77 or @entity78			2
he yelled to the crowd of 18,000 : ' nothing feels like tonight ! ' the arena was full of exciting concertgoers , as the chaotic crowd made way to their seats after waiting outside to enter the building			1
@entity1 emerged onstage as a video about @entity3 's history played in the background			2
he opened with his songs about @entity3 - ' where i 'm from ' and ' @entity91			1
' he also performed two songs from fellow @entity3 @entity93 he then held a moment of silence for the late rap veteran			2
anticipation : music fans arrive for the first of eight @entity1 shows which will open the @entity5 who 's in your pocket ? a protester wearing a sandwich board that reads @entity106 stands in front of the new arena on opening night sending a message : the group ' do n't shoot @entity33 ' also protested , this time against youth violence he told the crowd when @entity93 's ' @entity114 ' played : ' sing loud so he can hear you in heaven			1
' the rapper is the co-owner of the @entity43 , who will play at the new arena later this year			1
earlier this week @entity1 revealed that while he is happy to be seen as a high profile endorser of president @entity120 , at least one of his political ideas is more in line with @entity124 candidate @entity123			1
' i do n’t even like the word politics , ' he told @entity127			2
' it implies something underhanded and i think we need less government			1
' the @entity3 rapper recently hosted a $ 40,000 per plate fundraiser for president @entity120 , which raised a reported $ 4 million			1
' i support @entity134 because i got ta respect that sort of vision			0
i got ta respect a man who is the first black president ever , ' he said			0
the @entity5 will rival @entity40 's @entity39 for musical events			0
a number of acts have booked shows at the venue , including @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity143 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
famous faces : @entity151 , left , and celebrity chef @entity152 , right , were among the audience members freaky friday : the @entity5 welcomed fans of @entity1 amid the haze of friday night following a day of rain to mark the stadium 's opening , the @entity74 asked readers what they thought the @entity5 looked like and predictably the responses they received were not very complimentary			1
' @entity16 's old lumpy mattress , ' was one description , comparing the @entity168 governor 's bed to the rust coloured @entity5			0
another reader called it ' a soggy @entity172 ' , while someone else said ' in fifty years , if it is still standing , it will be called ' iconic '			0
submissions from those who live in the two neighborhood 's most likely to be affected by the stadium , @entity180 and @entity181 , were slightly less forgiving about the $ 1 billion construction			1
@entity183 from stroller - mom populated @entity180 called it ' urban blight ! ' , while @entity187 who also hails from the affluent area called it ' a beached humpback whale			2
@entity16 's lumpy old mattress ? @entity33 have been scathing describing what the new @entity5 looks like after the @entity74 asked its readers the new @entity5 basketball stadium has divided opinion in @entity3 and officially opens tonight as @entity1 plays a show finishing touches : workers put the finishing touches to the main entrance of the @entity5 last week other comparisons submitted included , ' a huge @entity205 ' , ' a rotting turtle ' , ' a rusty alligator skull with a pronounced underbite ' , ' an angry clam			0
an angry , angry clam ' and ' the burned bagel that will choke @entity3			0
' originally envisaged as part of developer @entity212 's @entity211 urban regeneration plan for downtown @entity3 , the proposals for the stadium were caught up in years of eminent domain challenges from local residents , which were resolved at the boroughs supreme court in 2010			1
with no size - able parking lot , the stadium is relying on spectators to make use of the extensive public transportation links to the arena , but residents worry about the extra cars and parking issues that will inevitably crop up			1
however , some of the likenesses seen by readers of the @entity74 are positive , looking forward to the @entity5 bringing new impetus to the already booming and confident borough of @entity3			0
' mega burger , medium well , pickle on the side ' , wrote in one hungry reader while another ignored the architecture to take a swipe at the @entity43 calling the arena ' an easy road win for the @entity243			0
' for @entity1 though , tonight is his home - coming concert , having grown up a few blocks from @entity246 and the @entity247			1

now @entity1 is part owner of the @entity43 and instrumental in moving the franchise from @entity168			0
he feels his rags - to - riches story embodies all that is possible in @entity260			2
' yeah i think i 'm the @entity260 dream , ' @entity1 said			0
