@entity8 who works with @entity10 in the family 's jewellery business in @entity9 said : ' i was absolutely livid when i saw what @entity10 had done			1
@entity10 has been threatening for years to put me on @entity5 but i never took him seriously , so i was shocked to see myself on there - it was quite scary			1
it was funny but listing me as used definitely was n't - the cheek of it			1

' all i want is a decent guy with good morals and who is honest and faithful , it really has got harder to meet decent people			0

' she is n't nasty , or possessive or self - centred , she is just a lovely girl who is beautiful both inside and out			0
' she has struggled to get a job for the past few months and has been down on her luck so @entity10 thought it would be a nice surprise to show off his matchmaking skills			1
' only she screamed the house down when she found out , she was really annoyed that he listed her as used			0
' but now she sees the funny side to it and i think she would be up for a date once the bidding is ended provided they are a good guy - her last relationship was over a year ago			1
