by @entity0 @entity2 committee member @entity1 at the start of @entity4 the @entity2 has been engulfed in a new scandal after it emerged that one of its board has been suspended for allegedly lying about his qualifications			1
@entity1 , who is also a @entity10 councillor in @entity11 , is being investigated over the claim , made when seeking election to the co-op board , that he was a chartered accountant			1
@entity1 was suspended by the @entity10 on friday after it became aware of the investigation			1
the probe into @entity18 board members was initiated after chief executive @entity19 launched a review of the group ’s records			1
@entity19 himself quit last month after declaring the organisation is ‘ ungovernable ’			0
the co-op refused to comment beyond confirming the suspension and that an investigation was under way			1
@entity1 could not be reached directly , but it is understood he explained the inaccuracy by saying he had previously been a chartered accountant but had been struck off after being declared bankrupt			1
but a spokesman for the @entity32 said : ‘ as far as our records show he is not and never has been a member			0
‘ only members of the @entity32 are entitled to call themselves a chartered accountant			1
’ @entity1 belongs to what one insider described as a closed group who have come to dominate the co-op despite its democratic structure of elected boards			1

@entity45 , who has been a @entity10 councillor in @entity50 , like her husband , quit the co-op to stand as the party ’s parliamentary candidate in @entity55			2
just days before the 2010 election , in which she was defeated , she was arrested for drink driving , having hit a roundabout late at night			0
she was suspended for bringing the party into disrepute			0
the fresh scandal is the latest to hit the bank since @entity49 was revealed to be buying drugs by a @entity65 investigation the co-op has been in the spotlight since its banking division plunged into losses last year and @entity70 was filmed by @entity65 buying class a drugs			2
former city minister @entity72 was appointed to assess the @entity2 ’s system of elections and appointments			0
he resigned last week in the face of bitter resistance from board members but plans to complete his review			2
a separate review by sir @entity81 , chairman of the @entity82 – an advisory government body – is looking into how the @entity48 came close to collapse last year			0
his report is expected after @entity85			0
last week the bank announced a £ 1.3 billion loss for 2013 and launched an emergency plan to raise £ 400 million to plug a hole in its finances			0
the @entity2 , which now owns just 30 per cent of the bank , will unveil its own results next week and a loss of more than £ 2 billion is expected .			0
