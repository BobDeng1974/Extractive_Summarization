the @entity17 administration official 's statements contradict a claim made monday night by @entity1 family spokesman @entity19			1
@entity19 told @entity21 's @entity20 that ' sources on the ground ' had confirmed @entity1 was kidnapped at the @entity5 border and sold to @entity25 for as much as $ 50,000			1
according to @entity48 , @entity1 's name was wrongly included on a list of activists responsible for the bombing of a hospital			2
while at the border crossing , @entity19 says , someone made a phone call to @entity25 , and @entity1 was later apprehended at a fake check point			1
the @entity0 said on tuesday that ' there is a broad investigation into mr. @entity1 ’s death ' still			1
' we are determined to bring those responsible for his death to justice , ' @entity6 added			2
@entity48 accused the @entity0 on monday of using the beheaded journalist as a ‘ pawn ’ and failing to do more to save him after he went missing in august of 2013			2
the @entity67 spokesman said it ‘ not true ’ that the @entity0 kept the families of @entity2 taken hostage in @entity5 ‘ consistently and regularly informed ’ and claimed that the family ’s relationship with the @entity0 was ‘ strained ’ even before their son was killed			1
' we do not believe that they gave us the cooperation we need , ' @entity19 said			2
' once @entity76 appeared in that video , the @entity1 family made one simple request of the administration , and they were rebuffed on that			1

fearing public outrage over the two atrocities , @entity17 administration officials told the press about a failed mission to rescue @entity1 and @entity90			2
@entity48 pushed back on monday on administration officials ' claims that the government did everything it could to save the two men and warned that the @entity1 family would have ' to speak out to set the record straight ' if administration officials continued to ' leak ' information to the press			1
' we know that the intelligence community and the @entity0 are [ immersed ] in a larger game of bureaucratic infighting and @entity90 and @entity76 are pawns in that game , and that 's not fair , ' he said			0
@entity19 said it was inappropriate for the @entity0 and @entity116 officials to be arguing publicly about the details of a failed mission to retrieve @entity2 being held hostage in @entity5 and said they should not be detailing how @entity90 was tortured before he was killed			1
' that 's just not fair to his family			0
they need time to heal , ' he said			0

' these are people of modest means			0
they do n't have college educations			0
they do n't understand the larger ramifications in foreign policy , ' he continued			0
' and we just do not believe that they were afforded the opportunities and respect that they should have by this administration			0
