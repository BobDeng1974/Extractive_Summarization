by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:10 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 24 october 2013 a @entity3 mp has told people who bought houses near a village cricket club to stop complaining about their broken windows and buy stronger glass			1
@entity9 said it was not fair for new residents in the @entity13 village of @entity18 ’s to demand the club spent £ 35,000 on a fence to protect their homes from balls hit for six			1
the @entity20 mp warned the huge bill could force the closure of the club , which is just yards from his own home			1
trouble : people living near the pitch at the @entity18 's cricket club argue they should not have to keep paying for repairs residents have complained to the @entity18 ’s parish council about the impact of cricket balls breaking windows and smashing roof tiles			1
the council owns the the king george v playing field , where the club has two saturday sides and plays friendlies on sundays			2
@entity40 , chairman of the council , said that both the council and the club were jointly liable for the damage caused			2
while nets were expensive , he thought they might be the only option			0
‘ we are endeavouring to find ways of solving this problem , ’ he said			2
but the idea of erecting a 30 - foot high fence to stop balls going astray was condemned by mr @entity9			1
he told @entity1 : ‘ the cricket club has been there for a very long time , those houses have not			0
‘ at the end of the day , they bought these houses knowing there was a cricket club			0
‘ to turn around and say the cricket club should fork out thousands is not right			0
people should buy stronger glass			0
‘ an important part of village life is the village cricket ground and to pay a whole lot of money for these sorts of changes could well mean the cricket club is lost			0
’ division : the row has dominated the village , where @entity3 mp @entity9 lives , with opinion split over who should pick up the bill for broken windows or a new safety fence however , a local resident calling himself @entity81 , said mr @entity9 had to ‘ get a grip ’ , adding : ‘ we ca n’t just all go out and spend £ 5,000 on new windows			1
’ another resident , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ whenever there is a cricket match on everyone around here knows to park their cars somewhere else and batten down the hatches			0
‘ the balls come whizzing out of the ground like a bat out of hell and countless cars as well as windows and tiles of neighbouring homes have been damaged			2

@entity9 warned £ 35,000 bill for safety fence would shut the club
@entity20 mp *criticised* by local people *fed* up with damage to homes by balls
parish council said it is ' endeavouring ' to find a *solution* to the problem
