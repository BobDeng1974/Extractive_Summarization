it seemed quite appropriate that a year to the day since @entity2 announced his ability to the @entity4 with a winner at @entity6 , he scored a double that just might earn him an @entity10 call - up			1
those 365 days have encompassed an awful lot for this 21 - year - old who is still learning and improving , both on and off the pitch			1
they include eight goals for @entity17 ’s under 21 side but also the moment he was allegedly punched by @entity18 in a dressing - room dust - up , and the time he was filmed inhaling potentially dangerous laughing gas through a balloon			2
@entity22 striker @entity2 could earn a call - up to the senior @entity10 squad it looked like he might leave the club he has called home since the age of 11 in the aftermath of those events but instead he has buckled down and is now reaping the rewards			1
there is dedication in his training , often staying behind after sessions to work on his game , and his fitness has improved – aided by a personal trainer			0
this season he has emerged the striker to whom @entity42 can hand responsibility of leading the line , with £ 10million @entity45 and @entity46 struggling with injuries			2
@entity2 was in devastating fashion as @entity22 thrashed @entity49 4 - 0 in the @entity4 the striker scored twice in the @entity22 ' convincing win at the @entity52 on sunday @entity2 celebrates scoring @entity22 's winner in their 2 - 1 win against @entity55 last season @entity10 boss @entity57 knows @entity2 from his time in charge of @entity22 @entity2 boasts a better goals per game ratio than all the other @entity63 strikers playing in the @entity4 this season			1
@entity65 goals in 6 games ( 0.67 ) @entity67 - 3 goals in 6 games ( 0.50 ) @entity69 - 2 goals in 5 games ( 0.40 ) @entity71 - 2 goals in 6 games ( 0.33 ) @entity74 - 2 goals in 6 games ( 0.33 ) @entity76 - 1 goal in 3 games ( 0.33 ) @entity79 - 1 goal in 4 games ( 0.25 ) @entity81 - 1 goal in 4 games ( 0.25 ) @entity82 - 1 goal in 4 games ( 0.25 ) @entity83 - 1 goal in 5 games ( 0.20 ) @entity85 - 1 goal in 5 games ( 0.20 ) @entity86 - 1 goal in 6 games ( 0.17 ) @entity2 scored two on the opening day against @entity89 , came off the bench to snatch a dramatic late win over @entity92 in the @entity93 , and produced his most complete performance to date with two against @entity49			1
he peeled away from his marker at @entity18 ’s corner so was able to nod in at to the far post when @entity98 got the flick on for his first goal			0
and then he curved his run to stay onside to receive @entity104 ’ pass and strike a sweet first - time finish for his second			0
‘ his movement for such a young player is very good , ’ said head coach @entity42			0
‘ he was a wee bit frustrated at half - time because he felt that he had made runs and things had n't quite come off			0
‘ i just said to him , as a striker , if you are going to score goals , you are going to have to make a lot of runs for that one that actually all comes together			2
@entity22 boss @entity42 has praised @entity2 's work ethic and his desire to improve as a footballer ‘ fortunately , he got that when it came through to him just right and his finish was great			1
he can finish with both feet			0
‘ he 's a great professional			0
i know people have talked about problems in the past , i have n't seen a moment of that			0
he 's been a pleasure to work with , he 's got a great future			0
‘ @entity2 works on his game every single day , he stays to do finishing and movement after training has finished and he 's getting his rewards for that			1
’ @entity2 scored the winner on his @entity139 against @entity140 in september 2013 on september 28 , 2013 , @entity2 struck the goal that condemned @entity55 to a shock defeat , just 23 days after marking his @entity10 under 21 debut with the winner against @entity140			1
@entity145 had brought @entity2 into the first - team but was dismissed less than two months later and that affected him			2
‘ i kind of lost myself , ’ @entity2 revealed last week			2
his form stuttered under caretaker @entity149 and @entity151 @entity150 , who played him to varying degrees , although he did finish the club ’s top scorer with nine goals in all competitions			1
@entity42 seems to have helped re-energise @entity2 , who arrived in @entity157 aged 10 as a refugee having fled @entity159 during the civil war that claimed the life of his father			0
@entity2 ( right ) struggled for form following the dismissal of @entity145 as @entity22 boss last term @entity2 finished as @entity22 's top goalscorer last season , with nine goals in all competitions he has overcome that hardship but it shapes who he is , and explains the drive he brings to his profession			1
@entity10 coaches @entity174 and @entity176 were in the stands at @entity178 to witness his destruction of @entity49 and @entity57 knows the player from his time at @entity22			1
with @entity76 still to recover from injury and @entity184 yet to find the net for @entity186 , there is potential for @entity2 to receive senior honours quicker than expected			2
there are two @entity190 qualifiers against @entity191 and @entity192 in the coming fortnight and time could be opportune to test his mettle			0
he is the leading @entity63 scorer in the @entity4 so far			0
‘ that will certainly make @entity57 think , ’ smiled @entity42			0
@entity2 could win a place in the @entity10 squad as @entity76 tries to recover from injury			1

@entity2 could earn a place in the senior @entity10 squad
