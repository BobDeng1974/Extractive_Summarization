@entity1 could be key to stopping prostate cancer growing , a study has found			1
scientists found @entity4 , which is produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight , boosted a gene which can block a chemical known to encourage tumour growth			1
@entity4 increases the effectiveness of the gene @entity12 - 15 , which researchers at the @entity14 , in @entity15 , found suppressed inflammation in cancerous prostate tissue			1
inflammation is a driving factor behind the growth of tumours in several cancers including prostate , gastric and colon			2
scientists have found @entity4 - produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight - boosts a gene that blocks tumour growth the study used a sophisticated computer algorithm to analyse samples of prostate cells and compare the prevalence of the @entity35 protein and inflammatory cells			1
the research , published in the journal @entity39 , found the @entity12 gene blocked @entity41 – a protein complex which triggers inflammation and promotes the formation and growth of tumours			0
although scientists already knew that @entity41 could worsen cancer , they had not come up with a solution to stop it			0
this latest research suggests that using @entity4 to stimulate the @entity35 gene could be a possible future technique for controlling prostate cancer			2
@entity54 , investigator at the @entity55 , said : ‘ when you take @entity4 and put it on prostate cancer cells , it inhibits their growth			1
but it has n’t been proven as an anti-cancer agent			0
we wanted to understand what genes @entity4 is turning on or off in prostate cancer to offer new targets			2
‘ inflammation is thought to drive many cancers			0
therefore , @entity12 - 15 may be a good thing in keeping prostate tissue healthy – it suppresses inflammation , which is a bad actor potentially driving prostate cancer			0
‘ there ’s been a lot of work on inhibiting @entity41			0
now from this starting point of @entity4 in prostate cancer , we ’ve come a long way toward understanding how we might use @entity80 to target @entity41 , which may have implications in cancer types far beyond prostate			1

@entity4 can help to block chemical known to encourage tumour growth
study used computer *programme* to analyse prostate cell samples
researchers say findings could have implications for many other cancers
