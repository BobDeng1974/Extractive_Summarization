@entity0 needs to learn from @entity1 @entity2 oozes passion for @entity4 and @entity5 should give him a go that tearful , emotional cuddle between @entity8 and @entity9 before sunday ’s game at @entity11 made me feel sick			1
what was all that about ? this is @entity15 at @entity11 to take on @entity16			1
these are the two clubs who fought out a fierce rivalry from 2004 when @entity20 bid the big - time farewell and settled for mediocrity , all the way through to 2012 when @entity24 emerged as champions			2
@entity8 ( left ) and @entity9 get ready for the first of several hugs together at @entity28 the pair embrace again on the touchline before the game , which ended in a 1 - 1 draw sure there was respect between @entity35 and @entity9 , but you did n’t have an emotional hug in the tunnel pre-match			1
i do n’t care if they know each other and worked with each other , they are now sworn enemies			0
@entity44 should have disarmed @entity9 by blanking him completely until after the game			2
it might not have affected @entity9 , but hugging him ? you ’ve got a lot to learn @entity50 , the @entity47 is all about the rivalry , so cosying up to the manager of @entity15 is not the way things are done			1
their faces were sterner after the game but they still found time for another hug ten years on from @entity35 having pizza thrown at him in the tunnel by fierce enemies @entity20 , we had a love - in at @entity11 this weekend			0
@entity9 normally disrespects opposition managers by offering a handshake before the final whistle			2
at @entity11 he could n’t wait to charge up the steps to the @entity16 dug - out to embrace @entity44			2
it ’s only a couple of years ago @entity9 was going too far with his antics , thrusting his finger into the eye of an opposition coach , the late @entity72			2
he was getting under the skin of a great like @entity75 to the point where @entity75 left @entity77 because he was so stressed by the pressure			0
@entity75 ( left ) and @entity9 enjoyed a far less warm relationship in @entity80 ' he is special , ' said @entity44 of @entity9 , pre-match			0
yes we know , he told us that himself years ago			0
@entity9 is showing us some true quality managing @entity15 this season			1
so this is n’t about the football on the pitch			0
it ’s about the rivalry of two great clubs			0
thankfully the @entity16 fans launched into songs targeting @entity9 from the first whistle – that ’s what this fixture should be about			1
the 1 - 1 draw was gutting for @entity9 , but i almost got a sense that he was happy to give his friend – football friend – a point in his fight to get @entity16 back to where they think they belong			1
@entity107 celebrates scoring @entity16 's last - minute equaliser at @entity11 on sunday @entity109 is mobbed his team - mates after earning @entity16 a point message to @entity44 , instead of whispering sweet nothings into @entity9 ’s ear , you should have spent more time getting the message out that @entity117 ca n’t possibly be designated the role of picking up @entity119 at a corner			1
message to @entity9 – are you going soft as you get older ? show some edge when you go to @entity16 , do n’t roll over and let your old boss tickle your tummy like a pussycat			1
@entity15 should not be friends of @entity16			1
they should be arch - rivals			0
the respective managers should be conscious of that and save the love - in until after the main event is over			0
throw some pizza instead of hugging each other like long - lost lovers .			0
