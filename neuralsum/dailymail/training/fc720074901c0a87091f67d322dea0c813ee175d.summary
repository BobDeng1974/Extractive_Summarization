while attention is paid to aircraft tracking systems following the disappearance of two passenger jets , a @entity6 airline ’s planes are outfitted with a system that makes them nearly impossible to disappear			2
@entity10 ’s entire fleet is protected by a 6lb electronic tracking system that activates when something goes wrong while a plane is in the air			1
the hardware is the size of a hotel safe and helps to pinpoint an aircraft ’s location during an emergency situation			1
when a plane is in distress the system the system transmits data – including location , altitude , airspeed and engine information – to computers on the ground using the @entity49 satellite system			1
in an age when it seems like it would be impossible to lose a plane – until the disappearance of @entity56 last march , that is – most commercial airlines have no comparable safeguard , the @entity50 reported			0
one of the prohibitors , especially for larger airlines with a massive fleet , is the massive cost associated with purchasing and installing the technology on every plane , plus training for staff			2
the hardware installed on @entity10 planes helps to pinpoint an aircraft ’s location during an emergency @entity10 has a fleet of nearly 25 planes , which carry more than 225,000 passengers every year the system used by @entity10 was designed by @entity76 , and @entity77 , the @entity79 company ’s chief executive , told the newspaper that installation along costs about $ 120,000 per plane ( approximately £ 77,000 )			1
@entity10 has a fleet of nearly 25 planes , which carry more than 225,000 passengers every year			0
according to the company , it automatically transmits four - dimensional gps - based position and flight data recorder information , including real - time positioning , when triggered by an airborne event			1
‘ the real - time streaming of critical flight data to the ground creates a “ virtual black box ” , allowing the data to be analysed immediately , ’ the company said			1
this @entity96 image provided by @entity76 shows positioning reports using the tracking system all commercial planes are equipped with a ' black box ' , which does not transmit information to the ground when the system is triggered data arrives from the aircraft within 15 seconds , and personnel are automatically notified via an urgent email or text message , or through visual or audible notification on @entity76 software			2
‘ with immediate event reporting and position tracking it is possible to enhance the provision of appropriate procedures and resources to improve @entity120 reaction times , ’ the company said on its website			0
most planes are equipped with the @entity122 and @entity123 , which transmits flight data to the ground but is not in real - time			1
flight data recorders , or black boxes , do not transmit information to the ground			0
the disappearance of a @entity132 plane sparked calls for improved flight - tracking systems the disappearance of @entity56 sparked calls for airlines to improve their flight - tracking and data - reporting systems so that they are more precise , transmit data more frequently and can not vanish without a trace while flying through ' blind spots ' on conventional radar , including oceans and polar regions			2
those calls were amplified following last week ’s disaster involving @entity148 flight @entity146 , which crashed into the sea off @entity150			0
but mr @entity77 is n't convinced that change will happen any time soon , telling the @entity50 : ‘ the industry itself feels it has no reason to hurry up and do it			0
‘ they feel everything is good just the way it is			0
i personally have a very strong feeling that it ’s not fair to the flying public			0

@entity10 's fleet is protected by a system that transmits real - time data
technology helps to pinpoint an aircraft 's location during an emergency
location , altitude and speed are sent to computers on the ground
many airlines use a similar system , but it does not transmit in real - time
