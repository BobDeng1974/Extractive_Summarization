@entity0 will host @entity2 games on back - to - back sundays as well as being the venue for an inter-divisional clash next year after 2015 's three regular - season fixtures were announced			1
the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are all returning to these shores for a second straight campaign while the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 will each play in @entity15 for the first time			1
@entity17 , who broke new ground in 2007 when hosting the @entity20 in the maiden @entity22 fixture , are sacrificing a home divisional showdown with their long - time rivals the @entity12 on october 4 in what will be the @entity6 ' third trip to the capital following september 's 38 - 14 win over the @entity29			1
just seven days on from that contest @entity42 make their first voyage to @entity44 as the home team against a @entity8 side which came from behind to beat the @entity47 22 - 21 in a thrilling @entity0 clash last month			2
' we are very appreciative of the outstanding support from our fans in the @entity44 , not only for the games at @entity0 , but for all of the related @entity2 events we have hosted throughout the city , ' @entity2 executive vice president of international @entity50 said in a statement			0
' we believe we have a great 2015 schedule that will continue to attract new fans to our sport and strengthen the bonds with our existing fans			0
' to provide @entity44 fans the opportunity to see games on consecutive weekends , to see new teams , and to attend a division game , which feature some of the most passionate rivalries in our sport , are signs of the growth and depth of our @entity44 fan base			0
' @entity34 quarterback @entity74 prepares to throw a ball during a practice session in @entity15 the @entity8 are also making a return to @entity15 when they take on the @entity14 in november all three contests held at @entity0 this year sold out several months in advance and that run of fixtures will end on sunday with @entity7 versus the @entity34			1
@entity83 's increasing popularity on this side of the @entity85 has led to suggestions that there could be as many as five games in 2015 , a possibility which was quickly quashed , while talk of a future @entity44 - based franchise continues to linger			0
the @entity2 have typically struggled to find teams willing to forfeit home fixtures in order to be a @entity0 host but @entity17 's decision to take a potentially pivotal clash with the @entity12 across the pond represents another significant step forward .			2

the @entity101 will play at @entity0 for a third time in october 2015
