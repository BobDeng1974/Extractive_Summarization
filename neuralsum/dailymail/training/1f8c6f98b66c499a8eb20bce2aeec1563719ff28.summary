by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 10:05 est , 5 july 2012 @entity1 on @entity2 : the new discs offer sharper hd resolutions which are supposed to look better on televisions it was supposed to be the technology that revolutionised how we viewed films in the home			1
@entity2 was hailed for its superior sound and picture quality , as well as the multitude of additional features available on the discs - a fact that is reflected in the price			1
but it seems that many people ca n’t in fact tell the difference compared with dvds when watching the film			2
some 39 per cent of those questioned said they simply could n't tell a difference in picture quality			0
the new discs offer sharper hd resolutions , which are supposed to look better on televisions			2
but even after six years on sale , they remain unpopular next to lower - resolution dvds			0
on top of that , 81 per cent said they did not even have a @entity2 player and were still using dvds			1
many will feel the difference in quality is not enough to justify the difference in pric , with @entity2 usually selling for around £ 20 , while dvds can be bought for as little as £ 4 these days			1
the poll results will be embarrassing for @entity44 which spent millions developing @entity2 technology			1
it has been the next generation video technology of choice since 2008 when it beat @entity49 ’s @entity48 in a battle which recalled the war between @entity52 and @entity53 over video players			0
but tech bloggers have long speculated that past a certain point viewers just do n’t care about the extra quality and do n’t want to pay a premium for it			0
a poll of 1,348 @entity62 consumers found they are yet to be convinced by @entity2 technology and 53 per cent think that it is overpriced			1
their concerns appear to be justified - on @entity67 a dvd copy of @entity69 : ghost protocol is £ 12.97 whilst the @entity2 version is £ 15			1
the poll also found that of the 19 per cent of people who have bought into @entity2 technology own just three discs			1
even extras such as @entity78 ( this @entity80 player is capable of playing @entity81 ) have failed to ignite public imagination by contrast , 38 per cent of all people who were quizzed said they owned more than 100 dvds			0
a further 44 per cent said that they own between 70 to 100 dvds			0
those who are prepared to buy into @entity2 do indeed get a far superior picture			2
@entity2 ’s maximum screen resolution is 1,920x1,080 ( 1080p ) , while dvd is limited to 720x480 ( 480p )			2
@entity2 has richer colours and more contrast because it uses superior video - compression methods			2
it also has better audio and more features such as menus you can access whilst your film is playing			0
normally with a dvd you have to stop the film first			0
the study found that another reason for the lack of take - up is the rise in online film streaming services which means people are buying fewer and fewer hard copies of films the poll was carried out by @entity112 .			0

81 *%* of those polled said they still used dvds
at least a fifth of those who own a @entity2 own three discs or less
