by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:45 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:25 est , 24 december 2013 this time last year @entity3 received a very special gift , one that was not just for @entity7 , but for life			1
when the 43 - year - old solicitor , who suffers from the degenerative disease cystic fibrosis , was told her kidneys were failing doctors said her only chance of survival was a transplant			1
it was then that @entity18 , her devoted husband of 15 years , stepped in to save her			2
he put his own health at risk by offering one of his organs , incredibly for the second time			2
thirteen years earlier , @entity27 accountant @entity18 , 40 , had given a portion of one of his lungs to @entity3 in a pioneering operation that was hugely controversial because so many patients had died during it			1
gift of life : husband @entity36 was a donor for his wife @entity3 's kidney transplant just before @entity7 last year the proceedure was so risky , it has since been suspended in @entity41 and @entity3 is regarded as something of a medical miracle because she is one of only four patients to have survived it			1
doctors and transplant experts also say @entity18 is the only known case in which a living donor has given up two organs			1
not only are the risks of such surgery considerable , doctors said it is highly unlikely for a husband to be able to donate to his spouse , as finding a suitable match for a transplant is notoriously difficult			2
twelve months on the couple , of @entity60 , @entity61 , have been trying to get her lives back together - and @entity3 has a special message of thanks to her husband			1
' @entity68 and i recovered well after the operation , we managed to get out just before @entity7 , although had to go to clinic regularly between @entity7 and @entity72 , ' she said			2
' if there was a husband of the century then he would win the award as he is truly marvellous but he would not admit to that			0
in sickness and in health : @entity18 and @entity3 were childhood sweethearts before marrying in 1997 ' the kidney worked well straight away , but i did have problems with water infections so they removed the tube that links the bladder to the kidney early and i was then fine			1
' the operation was more traumatic than we had anticipated , because we had not realised how much you use your stomach muscles , however we managed and as each week went by we improved			0
' @entity68 went back to work on a phased return after six weeks and i went back to work on a phased return in march being back full time in may			1
' generally things were going very well and i had a routine biopsy in may when that showed that i had infection and possible rejection which caused a scare and meant i had to go back on steroids and have much more frequent check ups until it cleared			2
' we had planned a short holiday so it was nail biting to know if we would be able to go , but we did go to @entity106 for a week and had a nice break			0
this made us feel like we were finally back to our normal lives			1
' things have been going well since and we went to @entity111 for a two week break in september for @entity68 ’s 40th birthday			0
' world class treatment : @entity3 received her transplant at @entity116 in @entity117 about 1,000 people in the @entity41 give up a kidney for a friend or loved one every year			1
the @entity121 , which regulates all donations by living people , must decide who is suitable			0
volunteers must prove they are in robust health and understand what the lengthy , physically arduous process will involve			0
there can be a 12 - week recovery period , and a one - in - 3,000 risk of dying while having a kidney removed			1
@entity18 , along with four members of @entity3 's family , including her father and brother , volunteered to be tested to see if they could donate			1
unusually , @entity18 turned out to be a good match and @entity3 's cousin also offered a section of his lung			1
' having a kidney transplant is nowhere near as serious as a lung transplant , but from the patient perspective it is more complicated			1
with my lungs , i know how they are on a daily basis , i can be wheezy or chesty and i take the necessary medication			0
' they do n’t mind what i eat or drink and providing i do not let myself get cold and do a bit of exercise then they work well and look after me			0
it is much easier to tell if they are not working properly and i can sort it out			0
' with the kidney , you have to make sure you drink two to 2.5 litres every day , be careful with what tablets you take or anything you put into your body as it could go through the kidney and you do n’t want to damage it			2
' unless you have signs of a water infection early , by the time you get symptoms it is already taken a hold			0
' so that makes me more conscience of everything and not able to completely forget that i have had a transplant			0
' that being said , i am much better in myself			0
i am able to have a life , work , do my hobbies , to the housework , go out etc , , which i could not do when my kidney was failing			2
' both employers have been extremely supportive , and my work have been particularly good given the number of clinic appointments i have had to attend over the year			2
' i am now down to once a month at the renal clinic which makes things a lot easier			0
the staff at the renal clinic are outstanding			0
' all the nurses and doctors work so hard , people are always moaning about the @entity194 but the staff at @entity116 , @entity196 and the @entity197 as outstanding			0
' @entity3 , who was diagnosed with the genetic condition cystic fibrosis aged two , was already on the transplant list when @entity18 proposed in 1996			1
the couple , who met when they were teenagers , were married the following year			1
cystic fibrosis affects the internal organs , especially the lungs and digestive system , by clogging them with sticky mucus , making it hard to breathe and digest food .			0

@entity212 , *39* , donated kidney after giving his wife @entity3 a lung
it was the first known case of a donor giving more than one organ
the couple , of @entity60 , @entity61 , are now getting her lives back together
and now 43 - year - old solicitor @entity3 has a special message of thanks
