but when @entity10 attempts to dominate this time round , he will not only come with @entity12 eyes , but also an @entity14 app in a bid to appeal to a generation growing up in the new digital landscape			1

@entity41 , the marking director for the company , told @entity43 : ‘ the original @entity10 was more than an animatronic toy ; it was the first toy that appeared to have a brain			1

’ among the changes are more sensors , so the new , @entity10 can respond better to touch			1
there are also apps for the @entity29 and @entity14 that allow you to ‘ feed ’ the creature and translate what it says			1
one thing that has n’t changed – both versions of the furry toy speak the made - up language @entity10 , a made - up language that sounds more like baby talk than anything			1
the 1990s @entity10 could eventually be taught some @entity67 phrases , though the sentiment that most owners tried to teach it was only three words – ‘ me love you			1
’ the new @entity10 will cost nearly double the price of the original , but @entity26 thinks $ 60 is not too steep a price , especially for the new features			2
flying off the shelves : two women among a crowd of several hundred reach for a @entity10 at the opening of the @entity81 in october 1998 ; it was one of the hottest toys for @entity2 that year 90s craze : the @entity10 craze had several franchises ; children are seen surrounding a display of the @entity89 at @entity81 in @entity90 in 1999 ‘ people are looking at $ 60 video games ; we thing people will play with @entity10 for longer than some of those video games , ’ mr @entity41 explained to @entity43			2
