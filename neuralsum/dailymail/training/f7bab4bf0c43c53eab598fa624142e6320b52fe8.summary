fire chiefs have been accused of ' burning money ' after spending £ 17,000 on bizarre plastic hands for people to press buttons on their smoke alarms			1
the 2ft - long red plastic sticks with a white hand and pointing finger at the end were paid for out of public money			1
and householders are given the pointers during home fire safety checks - to show them how to press the test button on ceiling - mounted smoke alarms			1
waste ? these 2ft - long red plastic sticks with a white hand and pointing finger at the end were paid for out of public money but the cost of £ 1.75 a stick was branded a waste when people can just use their own fingers or any stick or broomhandle to test the alarms			1
fire authority member @entity28 said : ' it is absolutely ridiculous waste of money , particularly when budgets are so tight for public services			2
all people have to do is use a broom handle or something similar '			0
@entity36 bought a total of 10,000 of the sticks , at a cost of £ 1.75 each - a total of £ 17,500			1
the sticks are approximately 24in long or just over two foot including the pointing finger			2
but they were blasted as a ' pointless laughing stock ' by some householders			1
one homeowner said : ' it looks like a comedy toy or a backscratcher rather then something the fire service should be spending its money on			0
' perhaps they should get the point - it is like burning money			0
everyone 's got a brush or broomhandle in their house			0
' costly : @entity36 bought a total of 10,000 of the sticks , at a cost of £ 1.75 each ( file picture ) a fire service spokesman said the sticks were specifically for the elderly and immobile - so they would not have to use a stool or stepladder to test their alarms			1
he confirmed the @entity74 - run @entity72 had funded the hand on a stick giveaway in a campaign called ' point the finger at safety - push the button not your luck			2
' the sticks are described as ' simple and functional hand held pointers ' by fire chiefs			1
assistant chief fire officer @entity87 , the service 's director of risk , said : ' as the statistics show it 's not enough to have a smoke alarm fitted in your home			2

' it looks like a comedy toy or a backscratcher rather then something the fire service should be spending its money on			0
