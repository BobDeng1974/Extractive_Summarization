@entity0 is considering building an 8,000 - mile high - speed rail link to @entity2 that would take less than two days to travel			1
travelling at around 217mph , the train would leave the north east of the country , run through @entity6 and enter a 125 - mile tunnel under the @entity8 , the shortest crossing between @entity10 and @entity11			1
it would then resurface and head south through @entity13 , before reaching its destination in the @entity2			2
ambitious plans : the 8,000 - mile high - speed link would begin in north east @entity0 and end up in the @entity2 it is unclear whether the @entity2 , @entity13 or @entity10 governments have agreed to the proposals			1
but engineers claim it would provide a viable alternative to air travel , according to @entity25			0
if completed , it would be 2,300 miles longer than the @entity27 , making it the longest train route in the world			1
the underwater passage would also be four times the length of the @entity33 , which connects @entity34 and the @entity35			0
even though the plans haven not been finalised , it is believed the project would be developed and financed by the @entity0 , who have become global leaders in high - speed rail travel			2
speed : the train would travel at more than 200mph and reach its final destination in under two days the country has constructed the world 's longest bullet train network with more than 6,200 miles of routes in service			0
in 2012 , they opened the world 's longest high - speed link between @entity53 and @entity54			0
the 1,428 - mile trip had previously taken 24 hours , but trains travelling at 168mph cut the journey to a mere eight			2
in january , plans for a multi-billion dollar international connection out of the @entity2 to @entity61 were announced			0
plans suggested the 300 - mile route would link @entity63 , @entity64 , to @entity65 , @entity61 - slashing the journey time from five hours by car to under two hours			0
in 2011 , a $ 65billion tunnel between @entity6 and @entity11 was given the go - ahead in an effort to bridge the @entity8 .			1

@entity72 would begin in north east @entity0 and run through part of @entity6
would then use 125 - mile tunnel to travel under the @entity8
it would resurface in @entity11 , head across @entity13 and finish in the @entity2
would be 2,300 miles longer than the @entity27
