by @entity0 mice infestation : the terrified star took to @entity3 to tell fans that she ' shrieked with fear ' after spotting the rodent @entity7 says she ' shrieked with fear ' when she encountered an infestation of mice at her plush mansion			1
the terrified star took to @entity3 to tell fans that she came face - to - face with a mouse in her living room in @entity15 , @entity16			1
ms @entity7 , 48 , was spending @entity17 at home with friends and family , but quickly took to the social media site to express her plans to launch ' operation vermin ' after seeing the mouse			1
she tweeted : my mum on her way round with her two killer cats			1
i 'm having a stiff drink			2
' she added : ' @entity31 vermin started early this morning			1
on my hands and knees looking for evidence			2
' the next day she tweeted : ' thank you for all your rodent killing advice ... taking it all on board			2
have declared war on them			2
' the star , has two homes in the @entity45 - a mansion in @entity16 and a stylish flat in @entity48			1
her mansion was reported to have cost £ 6million when she bought it two years ago with ex-boyfriend @entity52 , @entity51 , 44			1
it 's estimated that along with common house mice , there are over 10million super rats throughout @entity45 , in a growing problem that is cropping up in areas from @entity48 to @entity59			1
they also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison			1
experts say the conventional blood - thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to			1
now pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its response to the monster - size vermin and asking the @entity94 to approve stronger ‘ third generation poison ’ to kill them			1
@entity99 pest controller @entity97 from @entity100 told @entity101 : ‘ we ’re seeing an upsurge in rat call - outs , it ’s gone up significantly by about 15 per cent over the past year			1
‘ it ’s been very good for us			2
but i ’m not entirely sure what ’s causing it , it could be the weather , it ’s been very cold and it ’s been very wet			0
‘ they ’re twice as large as they once were			0
it ’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat			1
‘ the problem is that they ’re feeding more than they used to			0
they ’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away			0
‘ if there is vermin , 99.9 per cent of the time it ’s our fault			1
we ’re basically feeding them and they get used to it			0
so they keep coming around us to get more food , ' he added			0
a new map has revealed the hotspots where the rats are located , showing how widespread the problem is in affluent parts of the country			1
rat danger spots : this map shows the towns and cities where the super rats are across the @entity45 pest expert dr @entity144 , from @entity145 , also confirms that the rats are increasingly resistant to the poison being used on them			1
he also says that the resistance was thought to be confined to rats living in @entity151 , but it is much more widespread , as rats all over the country show increasing immunity			1
today , the ' monster rats ' are in every town throughout the country and there has been an increase in sightings in @entity59 , @entity162 and @entity48			1
during the 1960s onwards , rat poison was based on the blood - thinning agent warfarin			0
it worked by draining the blood from the rat and killing it			0
at present , pest controllers use bromadiolone , but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin			1
‘ we find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison , ' mr whelan said			2
' we used to use @entity176 when i first started out 23 years ago			0
it was the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but does n't do much now			0
' we need new , stronger poisons as they 've grown used to what we use			0
' however , rat poisons are controversial , due to secondary poisoning and risks to children , pets and wildlife			0
rodents are difficult to kill with poisons because their feeding habits reflect their place as scavengers			2
rats will eat a small bit of something and wait , and if they do n't get sick , they continue			2
an effective rodenticide must be tasteless and odorless in lethal concentrations , and have a delayed effect			0
there have been two generations of poisons given to rats			2
the first generation include : warfarin and coumatetralyl			0
the second generation are : difenacoum , brodifacoum , flocoumafen and bromadiolone			0
but rats are growing increasingly resistant to both			2
ridiculous rodent : this photo shows a huge rat that was caught in @entity213 earlier this year			0
it measured 50cm from tail to nose			0
both mr @entity97 and dr @entity144 are calling on the @entity94 to approve stronger rat poison			0
but wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds			0
however , rat sightings are growing , and one image taken last week in @entity213 , shows a giant rat being held up by its tail - and the man holding it is 6ft 1in , giving a sense of its horrifying scale			0
pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops , restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats .			1

@entity7 , 48 , took to @entity3 to reveal her mansion was infested with mice
the *actress* told fans she *'d* launched ' @entity249 ' to kills the rodents
the star said her mum brought her cats over to help catch the vermin
pest control experts warn the number of super rats appear to be rising
