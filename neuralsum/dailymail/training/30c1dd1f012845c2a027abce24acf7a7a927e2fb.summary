by @entity0 it may be getting colder , but the continuing trend for fake tanning shows no signs of cooling off			1
strictly , @entity5 and i ’m a celebrity have done much to boost sales of self tanning products and with @entity11 parties about to kick off , more bottles will be flying off the shelves as shoppers prepare for the party season			1
i used to think i had to spend at least £ 20 and upwards to get a decent self tanner			1
the earliest budget self tanners produced unattractive tangerine hues that were less than lovely and do n’t even think about the unforgettable whiff of some of the first self - tanning products - seriously stinky			1
cheap and cheerful ? @entity0 puts the new @entity25 £ 1 fake tan to the test for @entity27 but the quality ( and smell , thankfully ) of products under £ 10 is improving all the time - @entity31 ( the tan pictured here ) is an affordable self tanning range that is proving a winner with self - tanning fans			1
despite the lower price tags , some of these budget self tanners are proving every bit as good as the premium ranges			2
and now there 's an even cheaper range to try			1
love the @entity43 ( a range of four products that cost £ 1 each ) has just been launched by @entity25 , the low - cost skin and body range , which is developed and manufactured in the @entity48			1
all products are ph balanced and enriched with active natural ingredients that are kind to skin			2
but i thought this sounded too good to be true , so decided to try them			2
bargain beauty : @entity25 's £ 1 tanning range includes moisturiser , primer and smooth - on instant bronzer @entity0 's favourite : @entity27 's tester adored the self tan moisturiser and said it did n't streak love the @entity63 you should always exfoliate before applying self tanner , so it is well worth using this in your tanning routine			1
for best results , massage into damp skin and rinse off thoroughly			2
@entity72 skin dry before applying tanner			2
it does the job well , smells pleasant and is not too granular , so gentle on the @entity77 @entity76 this is enriched with cocoa butter and vitamin e and works in three hours to produce a natural glow			2
available in either light / medium or medium / dark			2
amazingly it did n’t streak			0
i tried light / medium , which was dark enough for my skin tones			0
i think the medium / dark would have been too dark and not natural looking			0
love the @entity88 i prefer wash off bronzing gels if i just need a bit of colour on my arms or legs			0
go easy when you open the tube as it comes out in a huge globby chocolate sauce spurt			0
for best results exfoliate first definitely use an application mitt or gloves with this – the colour is good and it certainly looks natural			0
it comes off easily with soap and water , but be warned – it takes a bit of rubbing to remove it			0
love the @entity43 is a collection of self - tanning products available for only £ 1 * each and all available to buy now at @entity108			1
fastest working : @entity31 1 hour @entity43 , £ 7.99 ( @entity110 ) this is great for last - minute fixes as it dries really quickly			1
the colour goes on evenly , but make sure the skin is prepared first , as it will stick to any dry patches			0
it ’s best if washed off after an hour , but leave it on for up to three hours for a darker shade			0
longest lasting : @entity121 , £ 8.99 ( boots ) a light gel that slides on easily and works well if it ’s buffed when applying with a mitt – do n’t even try applying this with just your fingers , as it streaks			1
its big advantage is that it lasts well – use every day for up to three days and the colour will last for a week			0
easiest to apply : @entity133 , £ 4.99 ( boots ) this mousse is really quick and easy to apply as you can see exactly where you ’re putting the colour			1
this is best applied with gloves so you can really blend it into skin and rub away any streaks as you ’re applying it			0
you need to keep skin well moisturised and the colour wo n’t flake off , and will fade gradually			0
best colour : @entity147 , £ 6.99 ( @entity110 ) this is a great range that does n’t always get the credit it deserves			1
although creams can sometimes be difficult to apply as they can easily streak , you wo n’t go wrong with this one			0
apply with a tanning mitt and it gives a light colour instantly			1
leave overnight and you ’ll be pale golden in the morning – even with fair skins , it wo n’t leave an orange hue .			0
