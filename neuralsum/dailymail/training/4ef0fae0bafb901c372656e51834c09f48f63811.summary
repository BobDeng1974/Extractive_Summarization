on thursday evening , the @entity22 showed pictures of the brothers , identifying them as suspect number 1 and suspect @entity86 the brothers are seen looking on as runners near the finish line , with @entity25 with his hands shoved in his pockets then he called the hotline number and was on hold for about 40 minutes , the response was so overwhelming			1

within 20 minutes , someone from the @entity99 called him back			1
' they were on the news ... clear pictures of the two subjects and those were the pictures that i sent in , ' said @entity15 , who started photography as a hobby when his sons played high school @entity108 was not the only picture - taker to help with images of the suspects			1
seconds after the bombs exploded , @entity114 pulled out his smartphone and took a photo of the chaos developing a couple hundred yards in front of him - the smoke , the people running in panic			0
the @entity26 brothers can be seen circled standing in front of @entity127 's restaurant @entity25 , circled right , looks like he 's speaking to his brother the brothers slowly moved their way closer to the finish line in these sequence of photos looking east on @entity135 , toward the finish line of the @entity2 , the first bomb detonated near the finish line , and the second happened in front of a @entity141 store the @entity143 businessman then put his phone back in his pocket and went to help the injured			1
it was n't until thursday , when officials released surveillance video of the two suspects , that @entity114 realized what he had - a picture of @entity26 walking away from the scene			1
@entity15 , from @entity153 , @entity154 , said that the two suspects stood in a specific corner for ‘ quite a bit of time			2
’ government officials have said that the brothers had not been under surveillance as possible terrorists			2

i do n't know who exactly framed them , but they did			0
and they were so cowardly that they shot the boy dead , ' father @entity203 said in an interview with @entity208 in @entity172 's provincial capital , @entity210 , clasping his head in despair			0
the mother , @entity213 , told @entity215 state television : ' it 's impossible , impossible , for both of them to do such things , so i am really , really , really telling that this is a setup			0
