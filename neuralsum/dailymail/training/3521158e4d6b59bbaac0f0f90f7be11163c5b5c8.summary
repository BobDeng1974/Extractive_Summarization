when it comes to beating the buzzer , this is a near - impossible move			0
during the @entity5 â€™s friday night game against the @entity6 , @entity3 managed to do something that has been called everything from a ' circus shot ' to ' the craziest thing of the @entity12 season '			1
with only 0.2 seconds left on the clock , @entity3 executed an over-the - head slap of the ball with two hands that landed with a swish , in what will undoubtedly become the basket of the year			1
making the move even more incredible is that @entity12 rules require 0.3 seconds to complete a full catch and shooting motion , so any shot @entity3 made at the time had to be a tap			1
however , they ended up losing to @entity6 99 - 94			2
however , as @entity48 from @entity49 blogged , @entity47 basket ' probably should have counted for another six points '			0
after the game , @entity3 maintained the shot was no fluke			2
' i know you wo n't believe me but i really do practice those shots , ' he said , according to @entity57			0
' my cousin @entity58 ( of the @entity59 ) texted me after the game , he was like '' they probably wo n't believe it , but we practiced those shots all the time growing up ''			0
' another look : @entity3 maintains he has practiced this exact shot before up and over : there was n't enough time of the clock for him to be allowed to catch and shoot boom : the moment has already gone down in @entity12 history			1

@entity72 occurred friday night when @entity5 versed @entity6
@entity3 tapped the ball with two hands for an over-the - head shot
the basket was *quickly* called ' the craziest thing of the @entity12 season '
