a @entity1 doctor accused of running a vaccination programme for the @entity4 to help track down @entity5 should be put on trial for high treason , a government commission in @entity1 has said			1
such a charge carries the death penalty and is likely to infuriate @entity11 officials , who are pushing for dr @entity13 's release			1
he has been in the custody of @entity1 's @entity16 since soon after the may 2 @entity11 raid that killed @entity5			0
treason : dr @entity13 , left , could hang for helping the @entity11 find @entity5 by setting up a vaccination programme the agency was humiliated and outraged by the covert @entity11 operation and is aggressively investigating the circumstances surrounding it			1
dr @entity13 's fate is a complicating issue in relations between the @entity4 and the @entity16 that were strained to the breaking point by the @entity5 raid			2
@entity11 and @entity1 officials have said dr @entity30 ran a vaccination programme in the @entity1 town of @entity33 where the @entity35 leader hid in an effort to obtain a dna sample from him			1
dr @entity13 was detained in the days after the @entity11 operation			2
a @entity1 government commission investigating the raid on @entity5 said in a statement that it was of the view that : ' a case of conspiracy against the state of @entity1 and high treason ' should be registered against dr @entity13 on the basis of the evidence it had gathered			1
the commission , which interviewed dr @entity13 and the head of the @entity16 , lieutenant general @entity53 this week , has been tasked with investigating how @entity5 managed to hide in the army town of @entity33 for up to five years , and the circumstances surrounding the @entity11 operation			1
death scene : the compound where @entity5 hid was found with the help of the doctor situation room : president @entity61 and his national security team watched events unfold together			0
they will be angered by the news it is headed by a @entity68 justice , and its members include a retired general , a former diplomat , a former police chief and a civil servant			0
it is unclear why the body would make this recommendation public , and whether it will lead to charges being filed against dr @entity13			2
the commission was formed amid intense international pressure for answers over how @entity5 was able to live undetected for so long in @entity33 , an army town close to the capital			0
sceptics will say it is unlikely to achieve that goal , given the power of the @entity16 and the army , and may well end up a whitewash			0
the vaccination ruse has been widely criticised by aid agencies , which have said it could harm legitimate immunisation programmes in @entity1			2
the vaccination team was reported to have gained access @entity5 's house in @entity33 , but that it did not confirm @entity5 's presence there			0
@entity11 authorities are trying to rescue the @entity1 doctor , his wife and children , and take them to the @entity11 , according to @entity1 and @entity11 officials .			0

@entity1 government commission is investigating how @entity35 chief hid in country for five years
