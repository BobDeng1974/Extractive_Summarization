by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 21 may 2013 two endangered sea turtles that are shells of their former selves after getting stranded during a cold spell are getting some help easing back into the wild — from an acupuncturist			1
@entity13 and @entity14 , juvenile @entity9 's ridley sea turtles rescued on @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , remained calm as acupuncturist @entity15 tapped more than a dozen needles into their leathery skin			1
the therapy session was intended to decrease inflammation on their flippers , restore movement and help the animals regain their appetite			1
' there is not a whole lot of literature out there on turtle acupuncture , so i 'm basing it on how we treat other animals and humans			2
' the needles , they are tiny , no bigger , like having a mosquito bite			1
you notice there 's no blood			2
' you can probably fit four or five of these inside the type of a needle you 'd use to draw blood , so they did n't really feel it			2
@entity13 and @entity14 were among a record number of more than 400 turtles of various species that got stranded on @entity10 and the southern @entity11 shore over the winter			1
the turtles were there to feast on crabs , fish and jellyfish as cold weather settled over @entity70 , causing hypothermia to set in and render the cold - blooded animals immobile and unable to eat for days			1
as their stunned bodies floated on the sea surface , their limbs were exposed to extremely cold winds that blew them to the beach			1
only 242 of the stranded animals lived , and they were taken to the @entity83 's offsite animal care center for treatment			1
the turtles also had secondary problems such as pneumonia , and were malnourished			0
recovering turtles swim at the @entity83 in @entity11 , @entity12 ' they have n't been eating in a couple of weeks , so they do n't have the energy that it takes to be able to fight off some of these things , ' said @entity95 , head of the aquarium 's marine rescue team			1
vets used laser therapy , antibiotics , enriched meals and other treatments to help turtles recover their health and strength before being returned to the wild			0
still , the sophisticated treatments could not help 14 sea turtles			0
that includes @entity13 and @entity14 , who are unable to use their front flippers — making it impossible for them to forage for food in the wild or escape from sharp - toothed predators prowling off the coast			2
' we reach a point , sometimes , in the therapy for these turtles that the traditional methods are n't working the way we want them to , and so we 've reached out to a licensed acupuncturist , ' mrs @entity95 said			0
one other turtle , a loggerhead , is also getting acupuncture treatment			0
the other 11 not yet back in the wild are continuing on traditional treatments for lingering infections and orthopedic ailments			0
the acupuncture is intended to reduce stress , increase blood flow and boost the immune system — just as in humans			1
@entity13 and @entity14 have already had three acupuncture sessions , scheduled once a week , said mrs @entity95 , who broke into a broad smile as she described their improvements over the past three weeks			0
she said : ' these two turtles really had very limited limb use and they were n't eating			0
we are seeing improved limb use and improved appetite			2
' they are eating on their own , which is fantastic			0
' describing her reaction to the results , mrs @entity15 said : ' it makes me feel very happy			0
' acupuncture is not an alternative to conventional medicine — they are also receiving @entity156 treatments as well , but the fact that it can work in conjunction with the other treatments they are getting makes me very happy			0

only 242 of 400 that were hit by cold weather on @entity10 , @entity12 , survived
hypothermia left them immobile and unable to eat for days
needles help reduce swelling and stress while restoring appetite
