by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 24 august 2013 he 's got a reputation for putting down mps on both benches with his cries of ' order ! order ! ' in the @entity10 chamber			0
but speaker @entity11 showed he has the remarkable ability to impersonate the parliamentary style of the @entity15 mps he keeps in check			1
mr @entity11 's impressions , performed while he was giving a talk to @entity20 students , may do little to endear him to the @entity21			1
however , his mimicry of education secretary @entity23 , @entity25 sir @entity24 and @entity26 was clearly in jest			1
the mini ' speeches ' that mr @entity11 gave to the students at the @entity39 of @entity40 in @entity41 were strikingly similar to genuine statements the @entity31 had made in @entity43 - with one of the examples dating back to 1998			1
in his assessment of mr @entity23 , the speaker said he was an ' extremely capable performer in @entity43 ' who can sometimes thought of as patronising			2
' @entity23 will sort of lavish the person with superficial praise ' , he explained , adding that mr @entity23 has ' a capacity for referring to other members in terms that are elaborate and nominally polite , but which if reflected upon seem to be pretty damming			2
' secretary of state @entity23 was described by mr @entity11 as ' an extremely capable performer ' giving an impression of mr @entity23 in action mr @entity11 began : ' well that 's a typically acute observation by the honourable gentleman , well i congratulate the honourable gentleman , he 's certainly brought to my notice a matter of considerable importance			1
' mr @entity11 added that the matter in question would normally have been ' as banal a matter as can possibly have been raised at any time that afternoon			2
' and mr @entity23 himself appeared to be impressed telling the @entity68 : ' i 'm afraid @entity11 has absolutely got me to a tee			1
he 's a very good mimic - and a very good speaker			0
' mr @entity11 then turned his attention to @entity26 who he described as being ' well - liked ' , but regarded by the @entity72 as ' a curious figure who has sort of wandered into the house from another century '			1
mr @entity26 is in mr @entity11 's view an ' extraordinary character ' , but one who could be regarded as something of a ' young fogey '			2
' he dresses in a very old fashioned way , ' mr @entity11 explained			0
' often with a waist coat and he 's always got his hankerchief in the right place			0
' he 's got a habit of getting up and asking questions in a manner that would have been done 50 - year - ago			0
' a typical @entity26 question was in the speaker 's opnion : ' is my right hon friend aware that it invariably falls to this great party of ours to rescue the country from the ravages of debt and despair , which it 's been the historic failing of the socialists ? ' that indeed bore an undeniable similarity to a question asked by mr @entity26 in march 2011			2
sir @entity24 , the oldest mp in the @entity10 , was last to receive the @entity107 treatment			1
' sir @entity24 's manner , you talk about old fogey 's or codgers , i would n't dream of making such a disobliging comment , ' the speaker said			1
ripe for the picking : @entity15 mp 's @entity26 and sir @entity24 also received the @entity107 treatment his example of a typical question by the 83 - year - old mp for @entity120 was : ' is my honourable friend aware that in 1955 when i served as personal assistant to sir @entity123 , he advised me then that ad hominem attacks upon the character of one 's opponents was invaraiably conter productive			1
' again the @entity129 parliamentary records show that sir @entity24 asked a strikingly similar question back in february 1998			1
' speaker mr @entity11 was speaking at the @entity132 in february this year , but the video was only recently uploaded to @entity134			2
told the students that mps who are ' very personally nasty ' tend to become disliked , while those who express themselves with a degree of wit tend to get away with more scathing remarks			0
@entity11 as @entity26 @entity26 - 22 march 2011 @entity11 as sir @entity24 sir @entity24 - 10 february 1998 @entity11 as @entity23 @entity23 - 18 june 2012 to a @entity72 mp @entity11 launches into an impression during his talk at the @entity20 university			1
his own verbal conduct as speaker of the house has been the cause of much citicism and he proudly recalled the time he was forced to call @entity147 to order after the prime minister labelled @entity149 a ' muttering idiot '			0
sadly mr @entity11 's own oratory skills in the @entity10 have been called into question a great deal recently with many regarding them as lacking in both wit and delicacy			0
he has been accused of ' flying off the handle ' with angry outbursts that contain scathing and unnecessarily derogatory remarks			0
some have even speculated that problems in his own marriage are behind many of his vitriolic attacks			0
some have speculated that problems in mr @entity11 's marriage to wife @entity166 are behind many of his vitriolic outbursts at mps he has also been called into question over his use of expenses			0
it emerged yesterday that he has billed the taxpayer for stays at some of the world ’s most exclusive hotels			0
documents reveal that the @entity180 has stayed at a string of five - star establishments during official travels costing the taxpayer £ 96,000 since 2010 .			0

speaker @entity11 was giving a talk to students at a @entity20 university
he was recorded mimicking @entity31 sir @entity24 , @entity23 and @entity26
the impressions were subsequently found to be strikingly similar to questions the @entity31 had asked in parliament
