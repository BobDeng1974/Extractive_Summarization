women are failing to exercise for fear of being judged over their appearance and ability at the gym , a new study has found			1
across the @entity8 two million fewer women than men take part in sport and regularly exercise			1
and a new piece of research conducted by @entity13 has identified three core factors holding them back			0
they found concerns over appearance , ability and whether they will , as mothers , be judged for putting themselves first , deter women from living healthier lifestyles			1
the study has prompted a new campaign to empower women , encouraging more to get active and improve their health			2
set to launch in january , the campaign will encourage women to join local sports clubs , gyms , and exercise at home			1
the study found the fear of judgement is greater than women 's self - confidence			1
@entity45 , chief executive of @entity13 , said : ' women do less sport and exercise than men , but most say they would like to do more			1
' so we had to get to the bottom of what 's holding them back			0
' we found out by talking to women of all ages up and down the country that what 's stopping them is fear , fear of judgement : whether that 's about how they look , whether they 're any good at it , or feeling guilty about spending time on themselves			2
' whichever way you slice it , women 's fear of judgement is sapping their confidence			0
' this girl can is a celebration of all the women who are finding the confidence to exercise : it 's an attitude , and a call to action for all women to do the same			0
' while identifying a host of reasons holding women back from exercising , the unifying factor was a fear of being judged			2
they found concerns over appearance , ability and whether they will , as mothers , be judged for putting themselves first , deter women from living healthier lifestyles the research has prompted a new campaign this girl can , which will launch in the new year and aims to encourage women to join sports clubs , gyms and exercise at home women who were interviewed knew they should exercise , and expressed a wish to take part in sport but despite that they did not achieve the recommended levels of exercise			1
the study uncovered a fear among mothers of being judged for spending too much time on themselves			1
worrying that others will deem they are putting themselves first appeared as a major barrier to exercise for those with children			0
and among other women of all ages , concerns over how they look while exercising was enough to stop them taking part in sport and exercise			0
the third major barrier was a fear over ability , whether they were good enough , too good and therefore unfeminine , stopping them			0
the @entity33 can campaign aims to address womens ' fears , by helping to show women are not alone in their fears			0
@entity13 said it is hoped the campaign will inspire a ' moment of realisation ' in women when ' they recognise that they are not alone ' , building confidence .			2
