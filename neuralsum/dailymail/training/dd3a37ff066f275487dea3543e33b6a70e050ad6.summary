by @entity0 published : 18:36 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 19:13 est , 11 december 2012 @entity1 is turning into a ‘ walk - on - by ’ society in which two - thirds of the public will not confront troublemakers in the street			0
in the past two years alone , the number of citizen ’s arrests has halved , according to a report by @entity11			1
at the same time , a @entity13 poll carried out for the influential think - tank found 64 per cent of @entity15 would carry on walking past a gang of teens who were drinking and verbally abusing passers - by			1
' walk - on - by ' @entity1 : two thirds of people say that they would not confront troublemakers in the street ( file picture ) apathy : less than 20 per cent of people in @entity27 said that they would step in if they saw a gang drinking and abusing passers by according to a @entity13 poll ( file picture ) nationwide , only 27 per cent would step in , and in @entity27 , the figure slumped below 20 per cent			1
scots are the most likely to intervene , with nearly a third of people saying they would take action			0
the report paints a depressing picture of the public ’s lack of willingness to participate in the fight against crime			2
in millions of cases , they do not even report crimes – potentially because they do not believe they will be solved or taken seriously			2
about 9.5million offences were measured by the @entity50 last year , which is based on interviews with households			0
by contrast , only four million offences were formally reported to the police			0
in the survey by @entity11 , 74 per cent of chief constables thought the public could do more in terms of reporting crime and disorder and 94 per cent thought the public could provide more intelligence			1
researchers say the figures for citizen ’s arrests , which are based on a @entity69 request submitted to @entity27 ’s @entity70 , are particularly stark			1
between 2002 and 2011/12 , the number of people intervening to hold a suspected criminal slumped by 87 per cent			1
report : a string of experts , including the previous @entity78 's anti-social behaviour tsar @entity79 , pictured , have previously warned that @entity1 is becoming a ' walk - on - by ' nation in the past two years – during which @entity82 ’s @entity81 was supposedly taking shape – the figure has halved , from 3,755 to 1,816 citizen ’s arrests in @entity27			1
@entity11 , widely regarded as the prime minister ’s favourite think - tank , calls for the police to make it easier to report crime			1
it says that , by 2020 , it should be possible for the public to report crimes by ‘ text , emails and social media ’			2
the author , @entity98 , also wants citizen @entity99 to be set up to train the public – using a mixture of police officers and voluntary groups with relevant expertise – on how to play their part in the fight against crime			2
they would be taught everything from how to perform citizen ’s arrests safely to how to avoid danger when walking home alone			1
mr @entity98 said : ‘ the police will always play the central role in the fight against crime , yet the public still has a part to play			0
‘ it ’s quite understandable that most people feel reluctant to be a “ have - a - go ” hero and it is important that they have the confidence to intervene and know when it is appropriate			0
’ there have been a string of warnings by experts , including the previous government ’s anti-social behaviour tsar @entity79 , that @entity1 is in danger of becoming a ‘ walk - on - by ’ society			0
in a report ordered by @entity135 , miss @entity79 said people are terrified they will either be attacked themselves or face arrest			2
she said the change in attitudes – blamed on a loss of trust in the police – could allow crime to ‘ strangle whole neighbourhoods ’			0
but criminologists say one of the reasons for the fall in citizen ’s arrests is a fear of being thrown in jail			1
@entity153 , 25 , was prosecuted for standing up to local teenagers in @entity155 , while @entity156 , 27 , was locked up after a female mugger he caught in @entity158 complained that she had been assaulted			0
both cases were eventually thrown out .			0

in the past two years alone , the number of citizen 's arrests has halved according to a report by @entity11
a separate @entity13 poll found that just 27 per cent would step in if they saw a gang drinking and verbally abusing passers by
that figure dropped below 20 per cent in @entity27
