two emaciated fishermen were recovering in a @entity2 hospital today after enduring a five month ordeal drifting helplessly in an open boat			1
the @entity6 fishermen told officials in the town of @entity9 in the @entity10 that they had survived by eating raw fish and drinking rainwater			1
their ordeal finally ended when they were picked up by a fishing boat called @entity15 , about 120 miles south of remote @entity16			2
badly sunburned and suffering from hunger , they were described by hospital officials as being in ' reasonable ' condition considering the many weeks they had spent drifting across the ocean			1
@entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) finally make it to dry land after their ordeal officials named the rescued men as @entity23 , 54 , and @entity24 , 28			2
a third man who had been on the tiny open boat had died , said the men			1
they claim that the man , @entity33 , 48 , died from ' severe health conditions ' while they were adrift in the @entity2			1
mr @entity36 died just two weeks before his companions were found by the @entity15 fishing boat			2
no details have emerged about what happened to his body , but it is known that in similar dramas on the high seas survivors have lowered those who have succumbed to the elements over the side of the boat as their bodies started to decompose			0
it was also emerged that mr @entity23 is the uncle of mr @entity51 - and their survival story was made even more remarkable because they were not fishermen but construction workers who were sailing from one small island to another			0
but somehow they managed to catch fish and eat them raw , while scooping up rainwater that had gathered in the bottom of their boat			0
‘ we were convinced that everyone had given up looking for us , ’ mr @entity23 told the crew of the @entity15 fishing boat which picked them up			0
‘ we know from other instances of boats being lost that after a while searchers give up , convinced that no - one can survive after many weeks in an open boat , ’ he said in broken @entity72			1
‘ we managed to sit out storms without being overturned , but that might also have led to people thinking we had no chance of surviving			0
‘ there is no doubt that after weeks , which turned into months , we were forgotten , except by our families			0
’ mr @entity83 , editor of the @entity84 in @entity9 said that when he saw the men step ashore from the @entity15 he noticed how thin they were , but thought that they were otherwise in ' great shape '			0
what might have helped their recovery , he noted , was the fact that they had been on the @entity15 fishing boat for four days after being picked up and brought into port			0
while the rescued men have still to tell their story in detail , it is believed they drifted helplessly for at least 1000 miles after setting out on a fishing trip in early july from their village in the province of @entity102 , which comes under @entity6 administration			1
the amazing journey of 1,000 miles that the two men from @entity6 survived all was going well until the engine on their boat broke down and they became victims of the ocean currents			1
' they saw passing ships but could not get the message across that they were in trouble , ' said an official on @entity9			0
according to a report from the @entity122 government information service on the island of @entity124 , the men 's boat had been carried out to sea by a strong current			2
the report said they had managed to survive a number of severe storms			0
@entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) were in surprisingly good condition when they were rescued @entity131 reported that the men were admitted to hospital for observation , although authorities claim the men are in good health , and that work is now underway to repatriate the men			2
the men 's survival comes after another astonishing feat when @entity144 fisherman @entity143 drifted across the @entity2 for 13 months before his boat was washed ashore in the @entity146 earlier this year .			1
