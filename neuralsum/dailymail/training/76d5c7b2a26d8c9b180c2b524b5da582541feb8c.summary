by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:43 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 01:10 est , 26 november 2012 controversy : outcry after @entity6 's catch of an octopus , seen proudly displayed in his arms , has launched a potential ban on their hunt statewide national outcry over a 19 - year - old @entity14 diver who caught and killed an octopus while publically boasting of his kill has pressed lawmakers one step closer to banning their hunt potentially statewide			1
' the harvesting of this animal has resulted in a strong , negative reaction from the public and the dive community , ' @entity20 of @entity21 and wildlife director @entity22 said in a release			2
' we believe this area may merit additional restrictions to enhance the traditional uses of this popular beach			2
' hunting octopus is legal in @entity35 , with a maximum catch of one per day			1
but on october 31st , the sight of @entity6 punching and beating the 30 - pound female on shore before throwing it in his truck bed and driving off easily unnerved many residents			1
' as they were coming in you could tell the octopus was alive			1
it was writhing around and they were wrestling with it , ' said @entity50 , a dive instructor who witnessed @entity6 bring the octopus on shore with one of his students			1
' it 's just not done			2
even if you can do it , you should n't do it , ’ he said			0
local activists photographed @entity6 's catch and posted the photos on their website , urging outraged residents to sign a petition banning the harvesting of giant @entity70 octopuses			1
@entity78 also reports @entity79 having had a permit to catch shellfish in the area			0
‘ i do n't have an issue with hunting , ’ mr @entity50 told the @entity78			0
‘ people dive for all sorts of reasons			0
i do n't have a problem with it			0
it is not whether you hunt , it is where you hunt , and there are appropriate and inappropriate places to do that			1
’ but he added : ‘ people come from all over the world to dive here and see the octopus that live here			1
’ earlier this month @entity102 , a member of the @entity103 , presented the @entity104 a petition signed by 5,000 divers supporting a ban on killing octopuses at @entity109			1
it 's a ban mr @entity6 has since latched onto himself			1
' i did n’t know they were so beloved , or i would n’t have done it , ' he said according to a @entity104 release that reported him signing the petition as well			2
the new @entity116 in @entity35 will require the commission 's vote for the new protected area and could take months			2
food ? mr @entity6 said he planned to eat to octopus and that catching it was no different than catching an eating a fish legal : game wardens said the catch was completely legal and that the diver was within his rights to harvest the animal among their considerations are designating @entity109 as a marine protected area or prohibiting hunting the animals anywhere in the state			1
angry fellow divers from the shore took photographs of @entity6 proudly standing with the large octopus and then watched in disbelief as he and his friend tossed the still live 30 pound female onto the bed of his truck before driving off			1
their shock turned to horror as a grinning @entity6 posted images of himself measuring the now dead octopus onto his @entity150 account and now is in the position of having to justify to the diving community why he hunted the gentle and intelligent animal			1
' i eat it for meat			0
it 's no different than fishing			0
it 's just a different animal , ' said @entity6 at the time to @entity160			1
catching the octopus for a friend ' s class assignment , requiring him to draw something from nature , he said : ' he wanted me to get something from nature , so i got an octopus			2
i caught it , and then these divers came up and started yelling at me			2
i ignored them and ended up driving away			0
' ' they ’re incredibly intelligent , curious , very playful , ' said avid diver @entity173			0
the uproar caused by @entity6 has led to the 19 - year - old receiving dozens of threatening phone calls and abusive emails			1
the wannabe rescue diver has said that he has been demonized by the local scuba community and has had to deny claims that the octopus was sitting on eggs when he captured her			2
' that 's not true			0
there were no eggs under it , and we checked , ' said @entity6			1
' i even had a game warden come over and look at it , and even they said there was no problem with it			0
' today , however , he says if he could go back to that day he would have done things differently			0
' i probably would have gone at a different time			0
i probably would have gone to another area of @entity200 , ' he said			0
@entity6 measures out the dead octopus on the floor of his garage in @entity14 ' the bottom line is another octopus will move up into that area and take its place			1
' the game warden who inspected the catch also said that despite doing nothing wrong , @entity6 could have acted with more sensitivity			1
' i think the timing , manner and place where the harvest occurred may be the issue			0
it could have been done at a better time , ' said @entity219			0
' it 's like deer hunting			0
you do n't kill a deer while kids are viewing it , and i think it 's a similar problem here			0
you need to be sensitive to other drivers and people if you 're going to be a sportsman			0
' indeed , @entity6 told @entity160 that he has now been banned from several diver shops in the @entity14 area because of the octopus hunt			1
he said that his dream of becoming a rescue - diver is in jeopardy because he has been banned from several diving schools because of his actions			2

once octopus - hunter @entity6 has now also signed a petition of 5,000 divers banning their hunt at @entity109
*decision* by @entity244 could take months
