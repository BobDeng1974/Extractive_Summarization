the @entity7 manager revealed : ' we are getting things together , getting a report on all the different opinions – what happened to him , because it ’s a real concern			0
' @entity33 is out of action with a hamstring strain and @entity6 admitted it 's a ' real concern ' @entity31 called into the @entity82 squad at 17 , @entity31 's career has been dogged by injuries since			1

@entity88 has been plagued by injuries since he joined @entity7 in 2006 @entity98 had a stop - start career at @entity7 due to injuries despite making his debut for the club at 16			2
missed the entire 2011 - 12 season after a stress fracture ankle injury sustained in a pre-season friendly against @entity106			0
@entity98 missed the entire 2011 - 12 season and still seems susceptible to niggling injuries @entity33 @entity6 claimed it took @entity33 three years to fully get over the double - break of his leg after a challenge by @entity112 of @entity113 in 2010			1
the fall - out caused bad blood between the two clubs with @entity113 arguing that @entity112 had become a scapegoat when it was an honest challenge for the ball			0
* * graphic content * * @entity33 broke his leg in a challenge with @entity113 's @entity112 in 2009 @entity122 suffered a sickening broken leg against @entity124 in 2008 that ended @entity7 's title challenge that season and effectively @entity122 's career at @entity7			1
although the @entity86 - born @entity130 forward did return to play for the first - team , he never reached his previous heights and was sold in 2010			0
* * graphic content * * @entity122 was also the victim of a horror challenge , this time from @entity135 @entity136 supposed to be the long - term successor to @entity139 , @entity136 's career was damaged when he broke his ankle after a bad tackle on him by @entity142 's @entity141 in 2006			0
still to make his 100th @entity9 start for the club despite being the club 's longest - serving player			2
@entity136 is yet to make his 100th @entity9 start despite being the club 's longest - serving player but the underlying statistics hint at a longer - term problem at the club			2
since they won the @entity151 in 2002 , @entity7 have picked up nearly two fresh injuries a week during season - time with some of their stars particularly affected , notably @entity31 , @entity98 , @entity88 and @entity136			1
their total number of injuries , 890 , compares unfavourably to other clubs over the same time period			0
@entity25 have had 794 , @entity41 788 , @entity43 666 , @entity30 622 , @entity44 596 , @entity45 578 and @entity46 553			0
@entity42 have had 777 injuries in the @entity9 over the period since 2002 and that does n't include their one season in the @entity162 in that time			2
@entity51 has been missing for @entity7 since picking up an injury against @entity44 last month while @entity6 is keen to improve the injury situation , he and @entity7 would argue that some of the more serious problems have been unavoidable			1
@entity33 did n't play again for the @entity18 for 13 months after infamously breaking his leg against @entity113 in february 2010			0
@entity136 's problems seemed to start when a bad tackle by @entity142 's @entity141 caused a broken ankle that kept him out of @entity9 action for nine months			2
now @entity11 is out and the bad luck continues			0
@entity173 out for up to 12 weeks with knee injury			0
