unless , of course , you fancy descending upon the otherwise untroubled environs of rural @entity12 in search of tasty morsels such as cats , poodles , gardeners ... that is why the good citizens of @entity20 , @entity21 , were at odds with each other yesterday over a whacking great eagle owl called eyeballs			1
occasionally you could spot him perched on a windowsill , and he even ventured inside , flapping around the living room of one friendly resident			2
bird of prey : it is believed that @entity55 escaped from a sanctuary or was set free by cruel owners before becoming a local fixture in @entity20 village in @entity21 ' trapped in their homes ' : some residents claimed they were scared to leave the house or use their gardens as reports spread of the bird attacking a dog and a gardener but some were not so keen			1
@entity71 and @entity72 , for example , said he attacked their poodle , @entity74			0
others feared he could harm children after he swooped on a gardener and drew blood from his neck			0
eventually , experts from the @entity82 - @entity83 organisation arrived to capture the bird			1
but now police are investigating whether it was done legally after a complaint from one resident who claimed : ‘ i saw the guy swing a net at it			1
i saw the wings of the owl flapping			0
he was screeching ... the net was quite small			0
‘ i was totally shocked and fearful for his safety			0
’ captured : eyeballs was seen regularly around the village before it was captured by experts at @entity101 and taken to their sanctuary police investigating : one resident called the police after @entity55 was captured , questioning the legality of the way the owl was captured police confirmed an investigation was being carried out into the capture of @entity55 , a @entity107 thought to have escaped from a nearby wildlife centre			1
last night the owl was being cared for at a @entity21 sanctuary and was said to be ‘ comfortable ’ .			2

some residents claimed it was *dangerous* and attacked pets and people
others said the bird was friendly and *harmless*
@entity82 @entity101 captured the bird and took it to their owl sanctuary
