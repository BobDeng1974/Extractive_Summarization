although thousands of people are thought to have been woken up by the rumbling this morning , it is not thought to have caused any significant damage			0
earthquake : the quake was felt at 4.16am today ( 3.16am in coordinated universal time ) just off the coast of north wales the biggest earthquake ever recorded in @entity31 with a magnitude of 5.4 stuck in the same area in the @entity34 in 1984			1
that was 250 times as big and caused chimney stacks to topple , the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) said			0
today an aftershock with a magnitude of 1.7 was measured four minutes later at 4.20am but it was so small that only one person has so far reported feeling it			1
@entity43 , a seismologist with the @entity35 , said today : ' we have had 193 reports from people who felt the earthquake already but that number is going up all the time			2
' a couple of those reports are from @entity17 , some from @entity19 on the @entity20 , and some in @entity15			1
' we do n't expect a quake of this size to cause any damage			2
a few people might say there were cracks to plaster but there wo n't be any structural damage			0
' with the quake in 1984 there were reports of chimneys coming off rooftops but that earthquake was 250 times as big with a magnitude of 5.4			1
' to put it in context , the earthquake which hit @entity72 in march 2011 with a magnitude of 9.0 was 67million times as big			1
' quake : the ground shook in the @entity34 at around 4.15am today			2
the epicentre was in the @entity7 , around 10 miles off the coast a report by the @entity35 said that people reported ' gradually grew louder			1
classic underground train passing sensation ' and ' woke the household any many neighbours '			0
mother @entity83 , 48 , said : ' the earthquake woke me up in the night from a deep sleep			0
' the house was shaking - i thought my two boys were running around wildly as the floor was shaking and rumbling			0

' @entity92 , of @entity93 , @entity94 , told the @entity95 : ' i woke up , i do n't why looked at the clock it was 4.15am and suddenly the rumbling started			0
' the one in 1984 was considerably more intense in that i remember in the house in the afternoon when one of them sort of started it sort of blurred your vision and things fell off your bookcase			0
' this one was nothing alarming			0
' the @entity110 said tremors were felt in counties in south - east @entity18 and its seismic stations in @entity114 off the south - west coast , @entity108 and @entity109 all recorded the earthquake			2
@entity117 , @entity110 director and from the school of cosmic physics in the @entity120 , said there has been a significant increase in seismic activity in the area in recent months			0
' it is unlikely that the magnitude of today â€™s earthquake will be exceeded in the @entity7 in the coming days but aftershocks can be expected in the hours and days ahead , although many will be too weak to be felt , ' he said			2
there was a far smaller earthquake in @entity132 , @entity11 , on february 7 this year , which had a magnitude of 2.3			1
