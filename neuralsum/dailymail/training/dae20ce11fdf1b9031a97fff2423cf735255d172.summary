by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the current harmony within the @entity3 camp in @entity4 despite the opening defeat against @entity6 is not in evidence at @entity8			1
this follows the surprising departure last weekend of @entity11 after five years in charge of the @entity3 under 19 team and seven as a national coach			1
upset staff , albeit anonymously , have made strong complaints to @entity18 about @entity11 being made a victim of the new regime at the national training centre under director of elite development @entity23			2
departure : @entity11 has been made a victim of the new @entity8 regime , according to upset staff they complain about a cliquey atmosphere , with @entity23 favouring his own appointments including close family friend @entity32 as @entity34 manager			1
and @entity23 and @entity32 are both in @entity4 - the former in a scouting role and the latter as part of a tournament study group - while long - standing @entity41 coaches are not			0
the @entity41 would not comment about allegations of unrest at @entity44 and @entity11 gave no indication of any problems in his relationship with the @entity41 in a statement following his exit			0
former @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 defender @entity11 , whose @entity3 charges have failed to qualify for the @entity56 for the last two years , said : ‘ it has been a real honour for me to coach the @entity58 , 19 , and 20 teams during the past seven years			1
‘ the international tournament experience i have gained is invaluable and i had the pleasure of working with some outstanding young @entity63 players			0
’ however the @entity41 ’s commitment to increase the number of black managers and coaches is at odds with the departure of @entity70 - born @entity11			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
after the kicking he received from @entity41 top brass @entity74 and @entity76 at the @entity77 , @entity72 president @entity71 has chosen not to attend any of @entity3 ’s group games			1
and do n’t bank on @entity71 , who called @entity74 ’s attack the ‘ most disrespectful thing i have experienced in my entire life ’ , watching @entity3 unless they reach the last eight			1
a @entity72 spokeswoman said @entity71 was scheduled for ‘ different matches ’			2
upset : @entity71 ( left ) has chosen not to attend any of @entity3 's group games @entity87 ’s place in the @entity3 starting line - up has been a matter of conjecture but the family have no doubts about him playing			1
@entity93 , kids @entity94 and @entity96 plus @entity93 ’s brother and parents have booked into the @entity99 on @entity101 beach , the most expensive boutique hotel in @entity103 , and have private jets booked to go to @entity105 and @entity106 for @entity3 ’s two remaining group games			1
follow : @entity87 's ( centre ) family have booked hotels and private jets for @entity3 's two remaining games @entity113 are expecting a peak audience of 20million for the @entity116 game , which would be the highest of the tournament if @entity119 ’s side do n’t make it of the group			1
and @entity113 are entrusting co-commentary to @entity123 , who has a lot more experience in that difficult role than the @entity128 ’s beleaguered @entity127			0
however rival broadcasters have sympathy with @entity127 ’s nightmare display in @entity132 that received 445 complaints			0
they blame @entity128 bosses for their decision to make that game @entity127 ’s live international debut			0
@entity139 in stadium chaos this wing - and - a - prayer tournament has left plenty of disgruntled vip hospitality @entity144 corporates , who have paid £ 1,500 per match , had the same unsatisfactory experience in both @entity132 and the @entity149			0
their entry wristbands were collected at the opposite end of the stadium to their hospitality areas and there was no one to direct them			0
the chaos at the patently unfinished @entity159 - with dust everywhere and no pa systems or anthems - was even worse and the corporate areas in @entity105 , where @entity3 play on thursday , are not complete either , with makeshift carpets installed temporarily			0
@entity165 is rapidly turning into the star of the @entity3 side on and off the pitch			2
as well opening his goalscoring account in @entity132 , @entity165 has proved to be the most engaging character of the team with the media and charmed the locals on the @entity41 visit to the @entity175 with his vibrant personality despite not speaking a word of @entity179			1
engaging : @entity165 has become a popular figure with the media and locals in @entity4			2

@entity11 's departure as @entity3 under 10 coach has *sparked* a staff revolt at @entity8
@entity72 president @entity71 has decided not to attend any of @entity3 's group games
@entity87 's family have booked hotels and private jets to follow @entity3 's final two group games
@entity165 has been the most open and engaging character in @entity3 's squad
