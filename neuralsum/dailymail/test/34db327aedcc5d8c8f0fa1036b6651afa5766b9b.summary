@entity0 made it six winners in four days as well as three flying dismounts with a treble at @entity5 on saturday centred around a neck success on @entity9 - trained @entity8 winner @entity7			1
@entity10 has sprung this week and @entity0 has been bouncing higher than @entity11			2
in this sort of form , those who suggested his best days were well behind him will have to eat their words			0
@entity0 leaps from his mount after riding @entity7 to win the @entity20 at @entity5 @entity0 rides mr @entity21 to win the @entity22 at @entity5 thursday ’s announcement that @entity0 ’s boss @entity24 had signed up @entity25 to ride the @entity27 - based horses in his expanding string , means the 44 - year - old @entity29 can concentrate on @entity30			1
that means less tiring criss - crossing of the @entity32 as well as having another positive spin - off – being available for rides going spare with old boss @entity36 after winter staffing rehuffles			0
so far , @entity0 has been mopping them up			2
three of the jockey ’s winners – @entity43 prospect @entity41 , who won the @entity45 at @entity46 , oaks candidate @entity47 , who scored at @entity5 on friday , plus maiden winner mr @entity21 on saturday were all prepared for action by @entity36			1
@entity0 said : ‘ the @entity50 was good			2
they went very fast and @entity7 is a horse that needs to settle			2
‘ i do n’t think i have had thee flying dismounts before so early			1
i have had a fantastic week			0
it is brilliant and being back at @entity36 ’s – i have gone full circle			0
i am back to where i started			0
’ @entity0 riding @entity7 to victory in the the @entity20 at @entity5 on saturday @entity0 had spoken of his enthusiasm for the season ahead when unveiled as the new ambassador for his home course @entity46 last week			1
he showed that on tricky @entity64 , 7 - 1 @entity62 - trained winner of @entity5 ’s @entity63			1
he now has nine winners from 29 rides , not sound seismic but it is significant compared to the last two seasons			0
the 2014 campaign had only 37 successes and , a truncated 2013 season when he returned from the doldrums of splitting from @entity74 and a six - month cocaine ban had him walking around like yesterday ’s man			0
@entity0 riding @entity77 win @entity78 at @entity5 on saturday he is no longer champion jockey material but he does look to have significant better chances of good rides in quality races			1
his 1,000 guineas ride will be @entity86 - trained @entity85 winner @entity84 , who runs for @entity24 , while he must pick from @entity86 - trained @entity87 third @entity89 and @entity90 ’s @entity88 winning two - year - old @entity91 in the 2,000			1
@entity86 has insisted both @entity8 second and third @entity92 and @entity93 will join his @entity87 winner @entity95 in the @entity96			2
he also might still run @entity97 , runner - up to @entity100 ’s @entity99 in the @entity101 saturday , in the @entity102			0
but after a disappointing show , some bookmakers have taken her out of the ante - post betting .			0
