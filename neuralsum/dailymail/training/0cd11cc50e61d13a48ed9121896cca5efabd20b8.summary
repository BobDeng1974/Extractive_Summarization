by @entity0 president @entity1 met with the leaders of the three @entity4 countries at the forefront of the illegal immigration debate this afternoon			1
@entity1 held a joint meeting with @entity9 president @entity8 , @entity11 president @entity10 and @entity14 @entity13 president @entity12 to discuss their ' shared responsibility ' to promote ' safe , legal , and orderly migration ' to the @entity4 , according to the @entity18			1
vice president @entity19 , who met with @entity8 and @entity20 last month in @entity9 , also attended today 's meeting at the @entity18			1
neither @entity1 nor the @entity4 leaders took questions from the press after the meeting , but @entity11 ' @entity10 said on thursday that he planned to ask @entity1 to do more to clear up ' the ambiguity ' surrounding the country 's immigration laws , including the president 's @entity29 for childhood arrivals program , and to step up law enforcement efforts to shut down drug smugglers and cartels			1
@entity1 met with : president @entity12 of @entity13 , left , president @entity8 of @entity9 , second left , and president @entity10 of @entity11 , right a @entity44 stands next to a 30 caliber rifle as he patrols the @entity48 along the @entity51 - @entity50 border			1
@entity52 has increased the number of law enforcement personnel it has at the border in response to the surge in illegal immigrant children crossing the border ' here we have to say that the coyotes , the smugglers , who are very much a part of organized crime networks , perversely have sought to exploit those ambiguities and peddle a mistaken , a totally wrong interpretation to the parents of these children in saying , " you can get your kids in the @entity51 , we can do it for you , " ' @entity10 said in remarks yesterday to the @entity75 , according to the @entity76			1
' those coyotes , those smugglers are nothing other than the human face of an enormous criminal monster that has one foot firmly in the camp of the drug lords and in @entity4 , ' @entity10 continued			0
the ' second foot is here in the @entity51 under @entity51 jurisdiction			0
' the @entity18 said after today 's meeting that @entity1 made it ' clear ' to the @entity4 presidents that children who come to @entity4 without the proper documentation will eventually be sent home			1
during the meeting today @entity1 also brought up the possibility of a pilot program that would set up screening centers inside @entity11 so that children would know before they left the country whether or not they qualify for refugee status in the @entity51 ' there may be some narrow circumstances in which there is humanitarian reason to allow them status			1
if that 's the case better to apply in country rather than take a very dangerous journey up to @entity52 to make those same claims , ' @entity1 said in brief remarks friday after the meeting			0
' but i think it â€™s important to recognize that that would not necessarily accommodate a large number of additional migrants , ' he added			0
' what 's more important is to find solutions prevent smugglers from making money that ensure greater security in @entity4			2
' @entity18 officials said thursday that program would not make changes to current refugee statutes , which most @entity11 children do not qualify for currently			1
it would merely establish a process within the children 's home country through which they can determine their immigration status before they make the 1,000 mile journey across the @entity50 to the @entity51 the number of unaccompanied minors making the 1,000 mile trek across the @entity51 to @entity50 has skyrocketed since @entity1 enacted his @entity138 program last year @entity9 president @entity8 said thursday at a press conference in @entity141 that he would like the @entity51 to extend any agreement it makes with @entity11 or @entity13 to his country , as well			1
' we expect that the solution to this problem also is equal for the three countries , ' he said			0
all three @entity4 countries are considered among the top five most dangerous in the world by the @entity150 and each sees thousands of young people leave for the @entity51 each year			2
as of the end of may , @entity51 @entity153 and @entity154 had logged a record 13,244 apprehensions of unaccompanied @entity11 minors , 11,449 @entity9 children and 9,835 @entity160 youths at the border since the close of the last fiscal year			1
that represents a more than 100 percent increase in the number of @entity11 children who illegally entered the @entity51 last year and an increase of more than 50 percent in @entity160 minors in the same time period			1
apprehensions of @entity9 youth ticked up the least			0
the number of unaccompanied @entity50 minors trying to enter the county illegally has declined this year , but it still remains high			0
since october , 11,550 young @entity50 have been apprehended at the border compared with 17,219 last year			0
@entity1 spoke with @entity50 president @entity177 on the phone last night			0
the @entity18 says @entity1 applauded @entity177 during their conversation for stepping up security along the country 's border with @entity9 and @entity184			1
@entity177 announced last week that his country would open five new outposts on its southern border and crack down on people riding the the rails north			0
already , @entity50 has doubled the number of children it apprehends at its border each day , but the country is only catching a small portion of unaccompanied minors compared to the number that show up on the @entity51 's doorstep every day			2
the @entity18 says @entity1 also reminded @entity177 on the call that neither his immigration reform legislation nor his @entity201 program includes amnesty for newly arriving illegal immigrant children			1
@entity9 president @entity8 , left , and @entity11 president @entity10 said yesterday at a @entity75 event yesterday that as part of its ' shared responsibility ' for the situation at the border , the @entity51 need to clear up ' ambiguities ' in its immigration process @entity1 's meetings with @entity4 leaders in @entity141 this afternoon comes a day after they met with @entity215 and @entity216 on @entity217			1
house speaker @entity218 said the @entity216 's meeting with @entity10 and @entity8 was ' constructive ' and their ' visit to @entity141 is further evidence of how seriously they are taking this situation			0
' i impressed upon them how important it is we all work together to end this crisis and reunite these children with their families in their home countries			0
' we continue to discuss our options with our colleagues , and remain firm in our commitment to find common ground and provide humanitarian relief , ' he said in a statement			0
republicans met on @entity217 this morning to discuss a $ 1.5 billion bill to provide emergency funding to government agencies that handle immigration			0
president @entity1 has requested $ 3.7 billion , but neither @entity216 nor @entity215 have proposed plans to give him the full amount			1
@entity246 @entity215 are considering a bill that would appropriate $ 2.7 billion toward the issue			0
it 's unlikely that the @entity18 would take up the @entity246 bill , as the more conservative members have expressed dissatisfaction with the amount their caucus is willing to give the president			2
but @entity18 minority leader @entity255 today expressed hope that two chambers can pass a bill with ' bipartisan cooperation ' that includes funding for most of the proposals outlined in @entity1 's original request			2
a major sticking point between the two parties ' bills is that @entity216 ' legislation includes changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the @entity51 to give children migrating to the @entity51 who are not from @entity271 or @entity50 due process before they can be repatriated			2
the president and his administration support changes to the bill that would give the @entity275 the ability to give @entity4 children the option of voluntarily bypassing the court system and returning home once they 've been notified of their rights			2
@entity255 has said in the past that while she did not support changes to the bill , she would be open to them if it meant that @entity288 would fund the president 's emergency spending package before @entity288 leaves for recess at the end of next week			1
the @entity215 leader is now hedging on her willingness to accept @entity216 - issued changes to the law , saying today that the funding request and reforms to immigration policies are two different things entirely			2
' there 's no reason why they have to be tied , ' she said			0
pressed on whether she would vote for a package that included reforms to the 2008 law @entity255 told reporters : ' i ca n't answer that			0
when i see the bill i 'll let you know			0

president @entity1 met with the presidents of @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity9 this afternoon
the @entity18 says they talked about their ' shared responsibility ' to get children from their countries to stop coming to the @entity51 illegally
they blame ' ambiguity ' in the president 's illegal immigration policies
the @entity4 leaders also met with @entity288 leaders during their trip to @entity141
@entity288 is still debating whether to give @entity1 additional money to pay for *resources* to care for illegal immigrant children
