there was mounting anger on tuesday night as the prospect of franchise - based professional rugby union moved a step closer with former @entity7 club @entity6 completing a multi-million pound purchase of @entity10 ’s @entity9			1
one @entity6 stalwart described the move , which will see the two - time @entity14 winners leave their current @entity16 ground in @entity17 and relocate to the 32,000 - seat stadium next season , as ‘ crossing a red line ’ while posts on social media predicted a ‘ toxic ’ atmosphere at this sunday ’s @entity25 clash with @entity26			1
@entity27 , who spent 40 years at the club as a player and then a coach , said : ‘ i want the club to be financially secure , but there is a time when you draw the line and say i prefer the club to stay even if that means going down the leagues rather than be transported elsewhere			0
you get so attached to a club and stay with them			0
@entity10 is n’t a million miles away but it might as well be			0
@entity59 understands @entity6 are also set to announce a new sponsorship deal worth close to £ 500,000 with @entity62 , whose global headquarters are in @entity65 on the outskirts of the city , but no amount of financial sugar - coating can appease diehard fans			1
as the local council was braced to rubber - stamp the move , @entity6 fans took to social media websites to discuss possible protests at this sunday ’s @entity16 fixture against @entity26 with a growing sense they have been let down by the @entity77 and @entity78			1
one @entity6 fan @ thewaspsblog tweeted : ‘ @entity80 on sunday at @entity16 is going to be toxic ’ while another post read ‘ what a sad day to be a @entity6 fan ’			2
despite the fans ’ anger , the move is a commercial necessity less than two seasons after @entity6 ’ financial situation became so dire that players sometimes went unpaid as the club was unable to meet the monthly wage bill			2
with average attendances of only around 6,000 at @entity16 , where @entity6 have played their home fixtures for 12 years , the @entity94 move will see the club attempt to build an almost entirely new fan - base in a catchment area historically targeted by the likes of @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
councillors also confirmed in the meeting that @entity6 plan to build a new training base in the city @entity109 football club @entity10 will continue to host home matches at the @entity94 ‘ it ’s an odd one , ’ said @entity101 director of rugby @entity111			1
‘ from what i understand , they are staying in @entity117 and will recruit from that area			0
‘ they will just travel 100 miles for their home games ! ‘ i am from @entity10 so it ’s going home for me			2
another game down the @entity123 instead of going to @entity17 ? perfect			0
’ professional @entity125 regulations mean @entity6 are unable to move their academy to the @entity10 area but moves are already afoot to build a new training ground close to the @entity94 with plans to relocate their current @entity133 facility in @entity117 within three years			1
on tuesday night it was unclear how , if at all , @entity6 players and backroom staff , who signed contracts to live and work in @entity7 , will be compensated for being asked to move 100 miles north			1
‘ we will be watching the @entity6 situation with considerable interest , ’ said @entity139 chairman and former @entity6 player @entity138			0
‘ it will be fascinating to see how it pans out			0
‘ @entity6 play in @entity10 but still train in @entity117 ? that is important because players have families , mortgages and children in local schools			2
‘ it would be madness not to consider the implications of what is being proposed			0
personally , i ’m a sentimentalist and find talk of a move quite sad			0
’ the club is set to hold a press conference on wednesday			1
@entity40 v @entity6 @entity160 converts @entity162 ' first - half try in @entity6 ' 25 - 14 defeat to sale on sunday @entity164 breaks through a tackle as @entity6 dominated possession but still lost to sale			0

@entity169 set to move home matches from @entity16 to @entity10

@entity10 councillors gave the move their backing in a meeting on tuesday
many @entity6 fans are angry at the club moving away from @entity7
@entity59 understands @entity6 are also set to announce a new sponsorship deal worth close to £ 500,000 with @entity62
