by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 had to be kept apart by umpire @entity3 as the @entity5 batsman was taunted by @entity6 during day five at @entity7			1
@entity1 was barraged by fielders and given a torrid time by @entity6 captain @entity2 , but the 23 - year - old held up well under the pressure of those around him			1
@entity1 , having withstood the jeers coming in his direction , was eventually caught out for 31 after a thick edge from bowler @entity16			0
it seems , unfortunately for @entity35 , that he was chosen for the majority of their taunts as @entity6 tried to play the psychological game as the @entity40 came to a close			2
leaving : @entity1 leaves the @entity7 field after being caught out after being taunted by @entity6			0

@entity5 batsman @entity1 and @entity6 bowler @entity2 separated by umpire @entity3 on day five of @entity40

@entity29 said @entity5 would be barraged in monday night 's press conference
