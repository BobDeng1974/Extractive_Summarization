by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 14 february 2013 golf is n't a sport known for players with reputations for physical toughness but no - one can doubt the iron will of @entity8 golfer @entity7			1
the @entity8 24 - year - old felt a sharp pain in her ankle as she played at the a pre-qualifier for the @entity13 at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , yesterday			1
iron will : @entity8 amateur golfer @entity7 in action in @entity20 ( left ) and ( right ) lining up her drive on the 18th tee during the second round of the @entity24 dangerous : @entity7 was bitten by a black widow spider , which secretes poison that can kill an adult in under an hour when the @entity30 native looked down she realised she 'd been bitten by a deadly @entity32 spider			1
@entity7 swatted the arachnid away , but before she knew it she was doubled over in pain , reports @entity36			1
a @entity32 is so venomous that its bites can kill an adult in under an hour - children can die within 30 minutes if struck by the creatures , and the caddies were terrified by what might happen			2
did the @entity45 rookie faint ? scream for an ambulance ? cry hysterically ? no. while the panicked locals rushed around , @entity7 , whose leg was already swelling up , calmly reached into her pocket , pulled out a golf tee and used it to gash open her bite and squeeze the venom out			1
' when i told the local caddies in my group what had happened , they got very upset and said it was a @entity32 , and immediately started looking for their phones to call the medics , ' @entity7 told @entity61			1
the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , where the hardy @entity8 was competing amazingly , @entity7 played on through her pain , shooting a 74 on the day			1
medics followed her around the course to make sure she did n't pass out			0
she described the moment she bravely sliced open the infected wound			0
' a clear fluid came out , ' @entity7 said			2
' it was n't the prettiest thing i 've ever done , but i had to get as much of it out of me as possible			0
' ' it still hurts , ' @entity7 said last night			2
' i do n't recommend getting bitten by a black widow			0
' she joked about the incident on @entity76 , calling herself ' spider - woman '			1
@entity7 joins the list of female sports stars who have grit their teeth and spectacularly played on through the pain			2
one such hardy soul is @entity83 , who severely sprained her ankle and damaged her tendons on the vault at the @entity87			0
with the team gymnastics gold medal on the line , @entity89 's coaches told her she 'd have to jump again , not knowing that the score she 'd received on the first vault had already guaranteed gold for the @entity97			0
limping as she walked to the runway , @entity83 nailed a two - foot landing , then quickly shifted her weight off her injured ankle as she raised her arms and saluted the judges			0
she had to be carried off the floor and on to the medal podium by her coach ( right ) and was honoured with a trip to the @entity108 .			0

@entity7 was bitten during a qualifier in @entity16
she used a tee to spike a hole in the wound and drained the poison out
