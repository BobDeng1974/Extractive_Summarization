the @entity2 president waves to crowds in pictures posted to @entity14 , despite the horrific war sweeping the country first lady : president @entity1 's @entity11 - born wife , @entity10 , embraces a woman in a photo from the @entity14 account , which is full of pictures of the couple conducting typical heads of state - style duties the president and his wife taking part in a photo opportunity , while entire cities like @entity22 lie devastated the @entity2 regime posted these pictures of smiling children			1
human rights groups say the president is trying to project an image of normality more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the @entity2 conflict since it started two years ago but as millions have fled the fighting to neighbouring states , the @entity2 regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life - as - normal image for the president			1
in his @entity14 account - where pictures were first posed on july 24 - the leader can be seen smiling , doing paperwork , meeting children and waving to cheering crowds			2
his wife @entity10 is also featured on the account speaking to smiling school children and tasting home - cooked food			0
an @entity71 campaigner said : ' no amount of photos or tweets or @entity76 posts will ever wash away the stain on the @entity2 government 's record ' @entity1 greets a little girl while visiting a hospital			2
human rights groups claim his regime has used hospitals to torture opponents hospital visit : a concerned - looking mrs @entity87 talks with a woman presumably injured in the fighting which has rocked @entity91 for more than two years as another patient looks on supporting her husband : @entity87 and her husband grin broadly at another meet and greet , with grim - faced minders conspicuously in the background she must have a good stylist : the always impeccably - coiffed @entity87 shakes hands with a @entity2 woman at a university graduation ceremony at work : this picture shows the leader reading papers , while across the country violence rages cynicism : @entity14 users stated their incredulity at the pictures @entity113 , deputy director for @entity114 in the @entity115 and @entity116 , said @entity118 's @entity14 account was something different to previous leaders like the deposed @entity122 president @entity121 and @entity124 dictator @entity123			1
he said : ' i think it is a generational thing , i am not aware older leaders like @entity121 and @entity123 used social networking , but the @entity2 regime has always been keen to show a business - like image to the world			0
' i am not surprised by this account , but it is a parallel between the regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality for the people subjected to the bombs , arbitrary arrests , human rights abuses and violence			1
friend of the people ? the president greets a youth group nice suit : president @entity1 looks appropriately humbled by applause from officials in this @entity14 picture @entity153 : president @entity1 appears to have stern words with a man in @entity157 headdress in this photo			2

' @entity91 campaign manager , @entity189 , said : ' on one level you 'd have to say that it 's not surprising to find any government , even the rigid and oppressive one in @entity194 , using social media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view			0
' image obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative stability is important in president @entity1 's " love me or i 'll kill you " strategy			1
' naturally , we 'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in @entity91 - of the torture chambers or places of execution			0
