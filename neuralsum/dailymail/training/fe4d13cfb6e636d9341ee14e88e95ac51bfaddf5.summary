by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 22 november 2013 @entity2 : 13:25 est , 22 november 2013 a seventh grade girl has testified before a federal judge for her right to compete on the boys ' wrestling team at her school			2
@entity9 , 12 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , told the court on wednesday : ' it does n't matter that i 'm a girl , because i 'm just as good as [ the boys ]			1
' she also said the sport has helped her overcome being bullied in the past			0
' i can take my anger and use it , but not in a mean way , and do good , ' she explained in her 40 - minute testimony			0
equality : 12 - year - old @entity9 ( pictured ) , who has been wrestling since the third grad , has testified in front of a federal judge for her right to play on her school 's boys ' team , because it does n't have a girls ' team members of the @entity32 countered that letting her play on the boys ' team would put her in physical danger , and that allowing body contact between boys and girls could make for awkward situations			1
in their federal lawsuit , @entity9 's parents are arguing that the school 's ban on co-ed competition in contact sports is a violation of the @entity47 of the @entity48			1
what 's more , @entity9 has been wrestling against both boys and girls since the third grade and had a 5 - 3 record last year ; four of those wins were against boys			1
but school board members say keeping boys and girls separated - especially in a sport like wrestling - is a necessity for several reasons			1
board member @entity61 asserted : ' i think it sends mixed messages			1
it 's inconsistent to teach male students that it 's fine to be aggressive and pin women down during a sport			2
' and @entity70 , another board member , testified that he is worried having a girl on the team will put the boys in an awkward and uncomfortable position			1
' if they win , they 've beaten a girl ; if they lose , they are harassed by their teammates for being beaten by a girl , ' he said			0
' i 've been bullied in the past , and wrestling helps me get over it			0
i can take my anger and use it , but not in a mean way ' he added that he has seen @entity9 crying after losing a match against a boy			1
when the match was over , she was upset and looked to be in pain , ' he recounted			0
@entity9 asserted , however , that it 's not out of the ordinary for competitors - including male competitors - to be upset after losing a match			1
i 've seen a lot of boys cry and throw a fit and throw their headgear on the ground , ' she explained			2
' i was n't hurt or in pain			0
it was just a matter of being emotional			0
' according to the @entity110 , school board president @entity108 argued that there are also ' sexual considerations ' that come into play in their current policy			2
he explained that ' it 's just not appropriate for males and females to be touching in such a way , particularly at ages 12 to 15 , when hormones are just starting to kick in '			0
he cited a specific wrestling move , where ' you 're supposed to stick your face in the girl 's chest			0
anywhere else you would be suspended , ' he said			0
the school has said they would be willing to sponsor a girls ' team if there is enough interest			2
a final decision is not likely to be made until early december ; until then , judge @entity135 has issued a temporary restraining order allowing @entity9 to wrestle with the boys ' team .			1

members of the @entity32 argued that letting @entity9 wrestle with boys could put her in physical danger
they also said that allowing aggressive physical contact between boys and girls ' sends mixed messages '
