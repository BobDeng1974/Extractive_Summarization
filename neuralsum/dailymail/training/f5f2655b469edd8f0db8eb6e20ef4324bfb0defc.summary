by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 08:50 est , 15 january 2013 @entity1 is a star renowned for her super healthy diets			1
previously a proponent of the rigid macrobiotic diet , which she followed for two years , in recent years she has relaxed her approach to food and taken to sharing her appreciation of it on her lifestyle blog @entity10 , or via her own cook book			1
she even dialled live into the @entity14 @entity13 talk show from her kitchen , where she could be seen swigging red wine while she defended claims she had not written the recipes herself			0
now , @entity1 's latest blog post reveals that , unlike so many other women in january , she will not be putting herself through the torture of the annual @entity23 detox diet			1
health guru : @entity1 is known for healthy lifestyle and beauty regime , which she credits with keeping her looking so youthful and slim at 40 - years - old ‘ happy 2013 ! i am not on a detox			1
i am not on a diet			0
i know , @entity23 ’s cleansing and all that			2
maybe later in the year			0
’ however , the news does not mean she has abandoned her healthy eating principles : ‘ so for now , i would like to continue with my pasta and cheese , but perhaps be more mindful of ingredients , ' she adds			0
' i asked my friend dr. @entity38 about his list of superfoods so that i could incorporate them into my diet a bit more			2
’ preaching the benefits of a healthy lifestyle ( as well as shopping , places to visit , books to read ) @entity10 has a huge following of fans all keen to emulate ms @entity1 's pure and virtuous lifestyle			1
@entity53 post , complied by @entity1 and dr @entity38 , lists nine suggested superfoods which you can incorporate into your diet , along with a sample recipe for each			1
surprisingly non-exotic and obtainable , the list includes blueberries , cruciferous vegetables ( lettuce to you and me ) , dark chocolate , spinach , walnuts , beans , avocado and wild salmon			0
the only mysterious item on the list is the chia seeds			0
these small dark seeds are rich in antioxidant , calcium , phosphorus and manganese as well as being high in fibre			0
@entity1 used her lifestyle website @entity81 to announce her intention not to diet this @entity23 - but instead to incorporate more superfoods into her diet family time : @entity1 posed with her children @entity87 and @entity89 while on holiday in @entity91 dr @entity38 says : ‘ the simplest path to vibrant health – and a spectacular @entity23 – starts with these nine superfoods – those naturally perfect foods which support the health , growth and maintenance of your body , just by loading up your plate			1
’ avocados are one of the 9 suggested superfoods some of the recipes do n’t even sound like health food at all - walnut pesto pasta , @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , and @entity109 are all on the menu , with step by step instructions , with accompanying photos			2
however the chia seed pudding and @entity115 with @entity116 ( essentially baked lettuce pieces with sauce ) may not quite be to everyone ’s taste			0
the end of the blog sees @entity1 posting idyllic photos of her most recent holiday at @entity125 in @entity91 which she describes as ‘ heaven ’			2
one shot sees the 40 - year - old star in her bikini , posing with her two children @entity89 , eight , and six - year - old @entity87			1
a perfect advert for her way of life , ms @entity1 looks toned and youthful in the snaps , no doubt prompting many to follow her latest dietary advice .			0

@entity1 announced on her website @entity10 she is not going on any kind of @entity23 diet
said ' i ca n't do it . not this year '
instead suggests incorporating 9 superfoods into your meals
40 - year - old star has been known in the past for her extreme healthy dieting
