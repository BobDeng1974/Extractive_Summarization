an alligator has become the first in the world to be given a prosthetic tail			2
the nine - year - old reptile , called mr @entity5 , was left unable to swim after having his rear end bitten off in a fight			2
the youngster struggled to keep upright in deep water and he faced a life on land			1
mr @entity5 , a 9 - year - old reptile , is the first alligator in the world to get a prosthetic tail the amputee alligator , which had his tail bitten off by a larger alligator when he was just a baby , is learning to walk and swim with his new appendage mr @entity5 , without his tail ( left ) , ca n't swim , and has a much harder time getting around			1
@entity21 ( right ) , of @entity22 , prepares to release mr @entity5 and study his movements using special markers with his new tail attached , mr @entity5 is now learning how to swim , moving through the water and even diving and swimming on his back but he 's been given a new lease of life after being rescued by reptile experts at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			1
the team had a new high - tech tail made out of latex and silicon at a cost of thousands of @entity39 they 're now teaching mr @entity5 how to swim again			1
@entity41 , from the society , said : ' mr @entity5 was probably very young and someone put him in with a much larger alligator - and the alligator bit it off			1
' alligators are cannibals so if you 're the smallest and someone else is hungry - you 're basically a menu item			0
' a tail is a vital appendage for an alligator			0
without a tail , an alligator ca n't swim - he ca n't move forward in the water so he just splashes in circles			0
needless to say , a tailless existence is not a very pleasing lifestyle for an alligator			0
' mr @entity5 was found among 32 alligators in the back of a truck that had been stopped as it drove through @entity33 and handed over to the @entity31 , which houses 1,500 reptiles			2
the team had a new high - tech tail made out of latex and silicon at a cost of thousands of dollars @entity71 , an orthopedic research associate with the @entity72 in @entity33 , who helped make the cast for what would become mr @entity5 prosthetic tail , poses with @entity41 of the @entity76 mr @entity5 was found among 32 alligators in the back of a truck that had been stopped as it drove through @entity33 mr @entity41 said : ' when he went into the pen with the other alligators we found we could n't put him in deep water because he could n't swim without turning himself upside down			1
' realising the animal would need a new tail , the team called in reptile specialist @entity86 , from @entity22 , to help			0
dr. @entity87 and his assistant @entity71 , both from the @entity72 , in @entity33 , were also brought in to help make a cast for what would become mr @entity5 ' prosthetic tail			2
the complicated process involved using infrared video cameras to track the animal 's motion and even his centre of gravity			0
the prosthetic tail was then made using a mould from a similar sized alligator and mr @entity5 ' stump			1
and the reptile now appears to be delighted to be back in the water with his new appendage			0
the process of making the tail involved using infrared video cameras to track the animal 's motion and even his centre of gravity it takes just five to 10 minutes to get the tail on mr @entity5 and fitted properly the prosthetic tail was made using a mould from a similar sized alligator and mr @entity5 ' stump dr @entity86 said : ' one of the wonderful things is he takes to it so quickly every time we put it on			1
' he never shows any distress or signs of fighting to slip out of it			0
one of the proofs of matching a tail to something that feels natural for him , is that he does n't mind - he started moving pretty much naturally as soon as he had it on			0
' once mr @entity5 learns to propel the tail , he 'll be able to maneuver , swim , and dive like a normal alligator			1
and , as he continue to grow over the next 60 years of his life , he will need up to 40 different replacements			0
