by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 16 january 2013 a hospital has sparked outrage by announcing it is to erect a smoking shelter outside a cancer ward			1
managers at the new £ 400 million @entity6 have applied for planning permission for five shelters on site after patients repeatedly ignored the no - smoking policy			1
they will be put up outside the hospital 's maternity block , two main entrances and its accident and emergency unit			2
bosses at the new £ 400 million @entity6 have applied for planning permission for five smoking shelters on site but the final shelter is to be installed outside the hospital 's cancer ward - a move which has infuriated victims of the disease and charities			1
cancer survivor @entity27 , 70 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , who still has annual check - ups after beating the disease in 2009 , yesterday ( @entity31 ) slammed the decision			1
he said : ' i know they have to accommodate smokers , but a lot of people in the cancer ward have smoked throughout their lives and do n't need reminding that could be the reason they are there			2
' it 's just plain insensitive			0
it is a huge site and they could put them somewhere a lot more discreet			0
i think it 's a terrible error of judgement			0
' @entity51 , founder of the @entity52 , said : ' i understand the difficulty of people who have been smoking all their lives to just quit			2
the move was taken after ents repeatedly ignored the hospital 's no - smoking policy ( posed by model ) ' but it is not pleasant for patients heading into hospital to have to walk through people smoking outside			1
' councillor @entity64 , chairman of @entity66 's @entity65 , said : ' i do n't feel the shelters are really addressing the problem of smoking			1
it is almost like condoning smoking			2
' @entity72 is a real issue in the local area and it concerns me that the hospital is providing for them			0
' what they should be doing is supporting smokers who are admitted to hospital to quit the habit			0
' hospital officials yesterday refused to explain why a smoking shelter was planned for the cancer centre			1
chief nurse @entity84 said : ' we do not condone smoking on our premises by patients , visitors or staff			1
' however , a degree of pragmatism has been adopted to keep the hospital clean and tidy and smokers away from building entrances			0
' the beautiful main entrance has become a particular problem area with a large number of smokers congregating and at times it has been difficult to keep the area clean			0
' we accept this has caused problems for neighbouring residential areas and are working with unions to see what actions can be taken to alleviate this			0
' we enforce a blanket ban on staff smoking on our property and staff will not be allowed to use the shelters			2
' @entity113 is expected to rule on the planning application in the middle of february .			0

five shelters are planned at the new £ 400m @entity6
bosses say the move was forced by patients repeatedly ignoring the no - smoking policy
cancer victims and charities have *condemned* the move
