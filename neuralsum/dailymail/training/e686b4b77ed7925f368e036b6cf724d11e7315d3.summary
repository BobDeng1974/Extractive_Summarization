the @entity0 claimed a first win of their @entity3 campaign with a gutsy triumph over @entity5 in an error - strewn @entity7 clash at @entity8			1
tries in each half by wing @entity11 and man of the match @entity13 were enough for the @entity14 to claim a deserved 15 - 3 victory against a side who had beaten them in six of their seven previous @entity20 meetings			1
their effort was all the more impressive considering the @entity7 region suffered a glut of early injuries - including captain @entity27 , who limped off midway through the first half			1
man of the match @entity13 crashes over for the @entity0 to seal a 15 - 3 victory for the @entity7 side the @entity5 were a shadow of the side who saw off @entity33 in round one , with mistakes handing the @entity0 both their tries			1
the @entity0 had gone into the game looking to replicate the dogged display they delivered out in @entity39 - despite falling to a 28 - 18 defeat			0
as for @entity5 , their target was to keep pace with the @entity44 giants following an opening win over @entity33 at @entity46			2
@entity0 fly - half @entity47 makes an early break through the @entity5 defence the @entity0 ' cause was not helped when @entity53 lock @entity52 damaged a hamstring in the warm - up and was forced to withdraw			1
@entity56 took his place in the starting line - up			0
it was all @entity5 in the early stages and centre @entity61 , in his first game back from a knee injury , should have scored , but spilled the ball with the line at his mercy			1
the visitors ' pressure was rewarded when @entity27 slotted a 14th - minute penalty after the home side had been penalised for holding on			1
@entity5 fly - half @entity75 fires over a penalty for the visitors ; it was the @entity5 only score of the match but , having dominated the early exchanges , @entity5 then proceeded to gift the @entity0 the game 's opening try			1
and it was all down to a horrible error from wing @entity85			0
fielding a long kick and seemingly under little pressure , @entity85 spilled the ball attempting to run out from his own line ; @entity47 gathered and fed right wing @entity11 , who had the simple task of scoring			0
@entity0 number eight @entity94 is forced to leave the field with a shoulder injury @entity47 missed with the conversion from wide out then pushed a 45 - metre penalty attempt wide			0
after the international fly - half was off - target with his third shot , the kicking duties were handed over to replacement @entity103 - on for the injured @entity27 - and he made no mistake to make it 8 - 3 after 33 minutes			2
@entity103 was handed another shot at the posts after @entity5 had infringed at a line - out , but his kick was off target , to the frustration of the home fans			2
on the stroke of half - time , after @entity0 had infringed at the breakdown , it was @entity5 fly - half @entity27 who caught the bug , missing a long - range attempt with five points separating the sides at the interval			1
@entity125 crashes through the attempted tackle of @entity126 ( right ) but is halted by @entity75 wing @entity130 went close for the @entity0 early in the second half , then @entity129 flyer @entity127 almost snaffled an interception for @entity5			0
it needed some desperate defence from the visitors to keep the @entity0 out after a scything break from @entity136 on 57 minutes			0
but it was not long before the @entity0 were celebrating a second try and again it came from a @entity5 error			0
scrum - half @entity126 went on an arcing blindside run , but lost the ball attempting his off - loaded			0
it landed in the arms of opposite number @entity13 , who gratefully raced 40 metres unopposed to the whitewash			0
@entity103 converted to make it 15 - 3 and , despite some late pressure , the @entity0 were able to see out the win , while denying the @entity5 even the consolation of a losing bonus point .			2
