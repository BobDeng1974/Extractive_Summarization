police arrived to the scene at the corner of @entity11 and @entity12 but did not break up the large crowds that gathered			1
the installation is narrated by an audio guide with a lisping voice speaking over an accordion : ' welcome to the fair , which life is n't			0
' this sculpture perfectly represents death in that — it 's a bit random			0
' it often said that the role of art is to remind us of our mortality			0
watch the installation : @entity1 mayor @entity44 said : ' it 's a sign of decay and loss of control ' and said graffiti ruins property better @entity51 : the month - long exhibition is coming to an end but @entity1 have high expectations @entity0 : the @entity56 piece will stay up until sunday as the city gets ready to celebrate @entity0 @entity2 started his career on @entity60 's underground street art scene in the early 1990s			1
he used some stencils but did a lot of freehand work too - and started officially specialising in stencils in 2000			0
by the mid- 90s , his humourous and cutting pieces were popping up in @entity66			0
becoming highly sought after pieces of art , his work was soon being auctioned off by art houses , who would leave the question of its removal to the bidder			0
now a typical artist name for coffee table books , he has still managed to maintain his anonymity			0
rumours circulate about his background , but the widely accepted story is that he was born and raised in @entity60 , the son of a technician , and trained as a butcher			0
he has now done pieces worldwide - from @entity86 in the aftermath of @entity88 to a fully - fledged gallery exhibition in his home town			0
' @entity2 's take on that seems to be mounting an art show that goes on for so long , we all wish we were dead already			1
' it follows the appearance of a graffiti of a man in a tuxedo solemnly holding a bunch of drooping flowers - as though he 's just been stood up - on the side of a strip club on 51st street			2
the @entity105 owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard @entity107 to protect the piece while they determine how best to preserve it			0
according to the @entity110 , @entity107 has been letting @entity2 fans pose with the piece ' if ( they ) ask him nicely			2
' today , is the 24th day of the @entity115 street artist 's month - long open - air residency in @entity1 , @entity116			1
there are only 7 days left			1
the @entity105 's @entity1 marketing director , @entity118 , told @entity110 this afternoon : ' we 're honored that @entity2 chose the @entity120 's @entity105 @entity1 to share his art. ' we respect the art and artist ; while we 'd love to leave the work in place , it 's required we lift the gate when we open for business , so after the public has the day to enjoy it , we will remove the door to keep it safe from vandals until we determine where it can be displayed in the future — hopefully inside of the club			1
' @entity2 revealed @entity137 officers aching to catch him had halted his activity for at least one day			2
the world - renowned street artist cancelled wednesday 's artwork after @entity1 officials urged people to file complaints against the @entity66 - based man of mystery and boosted @entity137 patrols looking for graffiti			1
