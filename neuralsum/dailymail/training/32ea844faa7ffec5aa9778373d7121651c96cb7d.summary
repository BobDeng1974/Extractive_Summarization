most brides opt for a traditional tiered white wedding cake decorated with delicate pink roses and lace for their big day			1
but one bride - to - be wanted something more alternative - and she sure got what she asked for			1
@entity7 , a bride from @entity8 , @entity9 , snapped up this black iced tyre cake online after seeing a beautifully decorated image , but what she actually received was much less glamorous			1
not what she bargained for : when @entity7 's wedding cake arrived , she was shocked by the monstrosity , it was nothing like the cake she had dreamed of ( @entity20 ) arriving at the reception on her wedding day , @entity7 was horrified to be confronted by a lopsided mess that barely resembled the well - finished three - tier cake she had requested			1
not only were the tiers lumpy and uneven , but they were leaning to one side			0
instead of being smooth , rounded and shiny like the promised picture , the icing on the cake @entity7 received was different shades of unappetising grey and cracked all over			1
the joins had been inexpertly covered with black ribbon , and the roses which had been on the cake dropped off			1
describing the cake that she received , @entity7 wrote : ' a few defects due to maker being unskilled			2
@entity38 , along with large amount of awful cupcakes for free			0
' she added : ' picture on the left is as it is , picture on the right is how it should have been			0
complete disaster ... offers please ? i have roses which fell off this abomination if required			0
' for sale : describing the cake that she unexpectedly received , @entity7 wrote : ' a few defects due to maker being unskilled			2
@entity38 , along with large amount of awful cupcakes for free ' the bids started at just 99p for the black cake and @entity7 received 11 bids in the time that it was up for grabs			1
she has , however , ended the sale - most likely due to a comment from a concerned baker who wrote : ' sorry , but as an experienced cake maker i just thought i would contact you			1
i do n't think you will be cake - shaming : the @entity73 seemed to be rather amused by the cake that was on offer able to / really should sell this cake on @entity77 , not least of which for health and safety reasons			1
' if someone actually ate it ( @entity83 ! ! ) - i would worry it might come back on you rather than the original cake maker			2
' i am sure you should be able to get a full refund from the cake maker in question			0
' if you need any help wording such a request ( demand ! ! ) i would be happy to help ? i am seriously shocked by this cake , the worst i have seen for a very long time - and i hope the cake maker in question is not still trading			2
' unfortunately there are now many so called " cake makers " setting themselves up with limited or no experience , and this is the result			0
' writing about the health and safety of selling a cake on @entity77 , @entity7 replied : ' thanks for message and concern about the cake			1
it has been advertised purely as a joke and i 'm not expecting anyone to buy it			0
' the cake was made for our wedding			2
and this is what was waiting for us at our reception			0
we have things in motion to prevent this person ever making a cake again and upsetting , or trying to rip off other unsuspecting customers			0
' i have amended the advert and added a disclaimer , however i do not expect it to sell ! thanks again for your kind comments			0
