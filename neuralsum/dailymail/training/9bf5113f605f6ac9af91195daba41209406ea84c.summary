for the @entity1 , this fire hydrant may as well be gushing liquid gold			1
over the course of the year the city earned $ 33,000 in parking fines by luring unwary drivers who thought they were parking perfectly legally			2
it does n't help that that the fire hydrant which is positioned on the sidewalk is some seven feet away from the road			1
however , if a car comes within 15 - feet of such a device , that car will usually receive a ticket and be taken to the pound			1
no parking allowed : a combination of road rules and confusing road markings is allowing the @entity1 to rake in more than $ 33,000 a year in parking fines to park or not to park : the painted white boxes make it appear to drivers that they 're parking in a safe spot			1
in actual fact , the spot is not legal because it is adjacent to a fire hydrant			1
they may as well be pouring $ 115 down the drain ' if a particular address had a huge number of tickets , i suspected that something might be amiss			0
and with some help from @entity37 , i launched my so called ' investigation			0

the fire plug is on @entity43 on @entity1 's @entity44			2
187 unsuspecting drivers have been caught in the last seven months alone			0
mr has calculated that with the fine costing $ 115 , it works out to $ 21,505			0
blurred lines : the @entity44 fireplug gushes out a flood of money for the city some $ 33,000 a year , according to one estimate by luring unwary drivers who think they Â¿ re parking in a legal spot the drivers blame two factors : white lines on the street look like the wide ' boxes ' that are often used when parking is permitted			1
' one theory is that technically , the lane behind the cars is not a protected bike lane			2
you would never know it by looking at it , but it is not painted and there are no markings			0
it is simply an empty space that people bike in			2
should that matter ? probably not , but the @entity77 might think otherwise			0
unless this is a deliberate attempt to craft a ' honeypot , ' there should be clearer markings on the pavement to avoid this seemingly arbitrary ticketing , ' says mr @entity39			0
a sidewalk extension that looks like a bike lane also creates added confusion for road users who may not realize that it is still prohibited to park in front of a hydrant , despite the large gaps and painted white lines			1
prepare to be towed : the painted white lines make it appear as though it is totally legal to park here , but the proximity of a fire hydrant should give cause for concern the space between the lines is easily wide enough for a car and marked with diagonal lines at some points - but not in front of the hydrant			1
mr @entity39 guesses that it is this particular hydrant that brings in the most money for the city out of all of the 110,000 fire - protection devices the pictures from @entity111 show what appears to be a protected bike lane between between the cars and the hydrant			1
the curb extension was constructed in 2008 to widen the sidewalk			2
there is also a misconception that drivers think it is perfectly legal to park on the traffic - side line when a bike lane is between the sidewalk and the traffic lanes - even when a hydrant is on the sidewalk			1
the law states that in such cases there has to be a sign specifically permitting parking there			0
mr @entity39 has said the @entity132 have confirmed to him that they will review the markings .			0

the fire hydrant is based in the @entity44
drivers are confused because they see a bike lane with painted white lines that show a parking space
@entity142 says the seven - foot gap between the curb and road is actually part of an ' extended sidewalk '
parking within 15 - feet of a fire hydrant usually leads to a ticket and the *vehicle* being towed
