by @entity0 published : 19:52 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 03:49 est , 9 january 2013 the report warns the @entity2 is not carrying out enough inspections to ensure patients are not at risk the health watchdog has lost the confidence of the public after missing some of the worst scandals in hospitals and care homes , according to mps			1
the @entity14 is not carrying out enough adequate inspections to ensure patients are not at risk , they said			1
in a scathing report , mps from the health select committee warn that ‘ patients , relatives and the public do not have confidence in the @entity2 ’s standards or the outcomes of its inspections ’			1
the watchdog had declared that the maternity unit at the @entity31 trust in @entity32 , where up to seven babies died , was providing ‘ safe ’ and ‘ high - quality ’ care			0
the @entity2 also failed to act after being contacted by a whistleblower at @entity36 care home , in @entity38 , where staff were torturing adults with learning difficulties			2
it inspected the home only after a @entity44 investigation			0
the @entity2 is responsible for 30,000 care homes , hospitals and gp practices			2
last february its chief executive , @entity48 , was forced to resign , albeit with a £ 1.4million pension pot. it has since promised to overhaul the way it is run			0
inspectors visited the @entity31 of @entity55 trust in @entity32 in 2010 and claimed that it was meeting all ‘ essential standards ’			0
but the maternity unit is now the centre of a police investigation over the deaths of seven babies and two mothers since 2008 and a coroner has warned that midwives may have ‘ colluded ’ to alter medical records and cover up their mistakes			0
and the @entity36 care home in @entity38 has since been closed down and six workers have been jailed for neglect and abuse			0
the report says the watchdog needs to ‘ raise the bar ’ when inspecting care homes			2
often the @entity2 inspects a home and concludes it is safe - even though patients and relatives are concerned the care is poor			1
the @entity2 failed to act after being contacted by a whistleblower at @entity36 care home , in @entity38 , and only inspected the home after a @entity44 investigation , the report says the watchdog has been repeatedly criticised over the last two years amid concerns it is not protecting the public			1
@entity89 mp @entity88 , chair of the committee said : ‘ the @entity2 ’s primary focus should be to ensure that the public has confidence that its inspections provide an assurance of acceptable standards in care and patient safety			1
‘ we do not believe that the @entity2 has yet succeeded in this objective			2
‘ the @entity2 needs to ensure that its inspections represent a challenging process which is designed to find service shortcomings where they exist , ensure , when appropriate that service providers address them rapidly , and report promptly both to providers and users of the service			1
the public has lost confidence in the watchdog after it missed some of the worst scandals in hospitals and care homes , says the report ‘ the @entity2 also needs to show that it treats feedback from the public as free intelligence and that it acts swiftly when serious complaints are brought to light this way			1
’ @entity123 , the @entity2 ’s new chief executive said : ‘ in our strategic review we consulted widely on a clear statement of our purpose and role			0
‘ we also set out our intentions to improve how we communicate with the public , make better use of information , and work more effectively as an organisation and with others , including those who provide care			0
‘ we have already begun to make some of these changes and will continue this process next year			0
