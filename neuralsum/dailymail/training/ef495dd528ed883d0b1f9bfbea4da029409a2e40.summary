by @entity0 foam rubber might not be the obvious choice of material for a bookshelf but for @entity6 designer @entity5 , it has proved to be perfect			1
the designer , who is based in @entity7 , has created a series of ' soft cabinets ' which work much like normal ones but change shape depending on what you put in them			1
the heavier the books , curios or trinkets , the more her amazing @entity19 style creations appear to be melting			1
metamorphosis : the cabinet looks innocuous without books but transforms once they are added @entity5 , who says her work was inspired by the look of protective foam spray , says that the cabinets are an attempt to persuade people to see the cheap and cheerful material in a whole new light			2
' foam rubber is a well known material but doesnâ € ™ t get the attention that it deserves , ' @entity5 explained to @entity35			1
' with the @entity37 , i am trying to increase the value [ of foam rubber ] through an unusual use of the material			2
' i wanted to show the material in its pure form without a covering and embrace the [ visible ] changes in the material caused by use and time			0
' young talent : @entity5 , who is based in the @entity6 city of @entity7 , will show her cabinets at @entity50 choices : the limited edition cabinets come in a choice of sizes and a range of different colours although the cabinets will not go on sale until the end of the year , they will be displayed at @entity50 in @entity61 at the end of october			0
the cabinets , of which a limited number will be made , come in a range of colours including turquoise , green and @entity5 's favourite , blush pink			0
' my love for the material grew after seeing a piece of pink foam rubber and increased after a visit to a producer , called @entity76 , ' @entity5 explains			1
' i 'm not professor in a laboratory who is looking for the newest technology - i look at what already exists			0
i 'm fascinated by details that are unnoticed or forgotten			0
' variety : each cabinet is unique with the eventual look dependent on what is stored in it			0

the ' soft cabinet ' is the *brainchild* of @entity5 from @entity7
her unusual @entity19 style design is *crafted* from foam rubber
the cabinets change shape depending on what is stored inside them
