altering a gene in mice has made them live 20 per cent longer - the human equivalent of living to 95 - years - old , according to scientists			1
scientists lowered the expression of the gene @entity7 , which is involved in balancing energy and metabolism			1
while the mice lived 20 per cent longer , the effect was not uniform , says journal @entity13 , with different organs and tissues affected in different ways			2
researchers from @entity20 s @entity19 said the study could be used in new therapies for age - related diseases that target specific organs , such as @entity25 s for example , they retained better memory and balance as they aged , but their bones deteriorated more quickly			1
researchers from the @entity19 say the study could be used in new therapies for age - related diseases that target specific organs , such as @entity34 ’s			1
scientists lowered the expression of the gene @entity7 , which is involved in balancing energy and metabolism dr @entity39 said : ' while the high extension in lifespan is noteworthy , this study reinforces an important facet of ageing ; it is not uniform			1
' rather , similar to circadian rhythms , an animal might have several organ - specific aging clocks that generally work together to govern the aging of the whole organism			0
' he said that further studies were needed to identify exactly how ageing in these different tissues is connected at the molecular level			0
the mice were engineered to produce 25 per cent of the normal amount of @entity7 , which researchers say is the minimum required for survival			2
they were smaller than average but otherwise normal			0
their median lifespan was 28 months for males and 31.5 months for females , compared to 22.9 months and 26.5 months for normal males and females , respectively			0
the @entity7 mice also had a longer maximum lifespan ; seven of the eight longest - lived mice in this study were @entity7 mice			1
this lifespan increase is one of the largest observed in mice so far			0
the study found that while the @entity81 mice aged better overall , they showed only selective improvement in specific organs			2
they outperformed normal mice of equivalent age in maze and balance tests , indicating better retention of memory and coordination , and also retained more muscle strength and posture			0
but they had a greater loss in bone volume as they aged , and they were more susceptible to infections at old age , suggesting a loss of immune function .			0

scientists lowered the expression of the gene @entity7 , which is involved in balancing energy and metabolism in the body
although the mice lived longer , some developed bone deterioration
researchers said the study could be used in new therapies for age - related diseases that target specific organs , such as @entity34 ’s disease
