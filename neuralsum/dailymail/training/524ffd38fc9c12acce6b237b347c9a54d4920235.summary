the @entity1 winner in @entity3 ’s midst is hoping to use the example of his previous charges as evidence that even unfancied teams can go all the way			1
@entity9 was the coach who guided @entity10 to both the @entity12 title and @entity13 last year before being targeted by @entity14 to work alongside @entity15 in the new @entity3 regime			1
now , having made an excellent impression in his first summer as assistant coach , he is hoping to bring his limited - overs expertise to an @entity3 team who have been starved of 50 - over success for far too long			1
@entity3 assistant coach @entity9 leads a nets session on tuesday at the @entity25 in @entity26 @entity9 talks to @entity27 in @entity26 as @entity3 prepare for their @entity29 match with @entity30 ‘ i would n’t sit here now and say we ’re going to win the @entity1 , ’ said @entity9 at the @entity25 after @entity3 ’s gruelling training session in the extreme heat of @entity33			1
‘ but what i would say is that if you get through to the knockout stages then anything is possible			0
‘ my experience with @entity10 is that we went into our final group game of the @entity12 against @entity42 and we struggled with the bat			1
' but we ended up winning the game and then did the same against @entity45 when @entity46 went our way			0
all of a sudden we were in the final			0
‘ our aim now is to get to the quarter - finals of the @entity1 and then anything can happen			2
people have said we ’ve got no chance and they can think what they want but we know we ’re improving all the time , we ’re working really hard and we want to give ourselves the best chance we possibly can			0
’ certainly the structure of another elongated @entity1 should benefit @entity3			1
they may be in the tougher of the two groups but all they really need to do is beat @entity60 and @entity61 to reach the last eight			0
@entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 head out for a nets session at the @entity25 ahead of @entity3 's match with @entity30 @entity27 keeps his eye on the ball as @entity3 train in @entity26 ahead of the @entity30 contest @entity3 captain @entity71 takes part in a fielding drill as his team bid to reach the tri-series final @entity76 faces the media on the outfield at the @entity25 , where temperatures have soared to @entity80 they have already been told their quarter - final will be in @entity83 which means there is no real benefit in winning the group			1
and as long as they make the last eight they will probably meet @entity89 , @entity45 , @entity30 or @entity90 and only the last of those teams would be a really big obstacle to the semi-finals			2
@entity30 may be the defending champions but they are not looking like it in @entity33			1
they are already weary having lost a test series here and seemed uninterested when they were thrashed by @entity3 in the tri-series in @entity100			2
their rained - off match against @entity33 in @entity103 means that @entity30 ’s second clash with @entity3 here at the @entity25 on friday becomes a winner takes all affair but @entity71 ’s side have good reason to be optimistic of reaching sunday ’s final against @entity33			1
while @entity3 worked hard @entity30 were nowhere to be seen and apparently they have no plans to train again on wednesday , apparently because it ’s too hot here in @entity26			1
yet friday ’s match will be played during the day so they will have no way of avoiding the 40 degrees plus temperature then			0
@entity63 celebrates his century in @entity3 's loss to @entity33 in @entity119 on friday last week @entity63 has been in excellent form as @entity3 's opener during the tri-series against @entity30 and @entity33 ‘ @entity30 ’s washout did n’t help us in theory but it ’s probably want we want because it makes friday effectively a semi-final , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ we want to put the boys under pressure and that ’s what they will be on friday			0
‘ let ’s be honest , we ’ve talked a lot about development and improvement but winning is the key and this is a chance for us to win a game and give ourselves another chance against @entity33 before the @entity1 starts			1
' @entity30 looked like a team who had never played on a pitch with bounce at the @entity142 and those conditions should be even more apparent at the @entity25			2
‘ they ’re the best two grounds we could have played @entity30 on , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ i think our bowlers will be running in excited about bowling on here			0
we watched the @entity148 game here on sunday and it was exciting to see the ball flying through			0
’ @entity152 has also been rediscovering some of his best form as @entity3 warm up for the @entity1 @entity3 's @entity64 bats during the narrow defeat to @entity33 in the tri-series last week that will put the onus on an @entity3 bowling attack led by @entity160 and @entity76 , who are still returning to their best after injury			1
‘ they ’re not far away and i think every game back helps , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ @entity152 and @entity164 have done well too			0
@entity165 is a sign of where we are as a team			0
at the start of last summer he was n’t in the team and now he ’s almost one of our first picks			0
' by playing consistently and with the selectors backing him he ’s growing in confidence and his performances have improved			0
that ’s what ’s happening to the team as well			0
’ quietly @entity3 are coming together here			2
and wins against @entity30 and , finally , @entity33 are needed now to prove it .			2
