by @entity1 reporter published : 09:13 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 4 september 2013 for ten years , she wore false eyelashes every day to give her the glamorous look she craved			0
but @entity8 ’s ‘ addiction ’ to the enhancements came at a price , damaging her natural lashes so severely that hardly any were left			1
in desperation , the 42 - year - old sought medical help – and has now become the first patient in the @entity13 to go public after undergoing a pioneering eyelash transplant			0
ms @entity8 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , ( pictured after her transplant ) said her life has been transformed by the eyelash transplant operation at the @entity21 in @entity17 miss @entity8 spent £ 4,000 having 70 eyelashes transplanted into her eyelids in a three - hour operation			1
a strip of hair was taken from the back of her scalp and the individual hair follicles removed			0
the surgeon then threaded each hair into the skin at the bottom of her eyelids using a special needle			0
miss @entity8 said : ‘ i am so pleased i have had it done			2
the only new beauty routine i will have to adopt is curling and trimming my new lashes every couple of weeks			0
‘ because they are made from head hair they grow in just the same way and need more grooming than natural eyelashes			1
’ the finance director was left with just three eyelashes on her upper right lid and 19 on her upper left lid after years of damage caused by gluing on extensions			1
she said : ‘ i was spending around £ 100 every couple of months buying them , along with the glue and solutions for my eyes			0
consequences : @entity8 , 42 , said she ended up looking like a ' frog ' when she lost most of her natural lashes dr @entity59 transplanted 70 new eyelashes in each of @entity8 's eyelids in a three hour operation			1
this image was taken shortly afterwards pictured her with her transplanted lashes , ms @entity8 said : ' it feels like a miracle to have hair on my eyelids when for so long there was nothing			1
i will now have lovely long , natural eyelashes for the rest of my life - and need never wear false eyelashes again ' ‘ i would never take them out and left no time for my normal eyelashes to recover after their use			1
gradually my lashes started falling out – which made me even more dependent on the extensions			0
’ the damage was made worse when she got an eye infection a year ago which caused itching , and she rubbed off many of the weakened lashes that were left			0
increasing numbers of women are damaging their eyelashes permanently due having overindulged in synthetic lashes like ms @entity8 ( pictured ) with almost completely bald upper lids , miss @entity8 was too embarrassed to leave her house or let her family , boyfriend or friends see her without false eyelashes			1
she recalled : ‘ i ended up looking like a frog			2
i could not bear to look at myself in the mirror			0
’ but miss @entity8 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , said her life has now been transformed by the operation at the @entity21 in @entity17			2
the procedure was pioneered in @entity101 and brought to the @entity13 by surgeon @entity59 , hair loss expert on @entity104 ’s @entity103			0
dr @entity59 , who carried out miss @entity8 ’s transplant , said : ‘ lots of women permanently damage their eyelashes by overusing false ones			1
the glue can block the hair follicle and they can end up losing their natural lash			0
‘ the problem has been made worse by the boom in their use in recent years , thanks to celebrities such as @entity119			0
‘ i also see women needing eyelash transplants who have suffered from trichotillomania – a psychological conditions which sees them rip out their eyelashes			2
’ dr @entity59 said the transplant procedure was becoming more popular in the @entity13 , though @entity125 is the first patient to talk about her experience publicly			1
he added that her new lashes will take at least six months to look their best – but should then last ‘ for the rest of her life ’			2
