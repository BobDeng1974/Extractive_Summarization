one family got the surprise of a lifetime on @entity3			2
@entity4 of @entity5 , @entity6 , took his son and daughter out for a ride in their kayak on @entity13 harbor when the group was joined by an adorable guest - a baby sea lion			1
and while the family was nervous at first to have the wild animal join them , the sea lion proved to be a delightful guest			1
a baby sea lion caught a ride with one family on @entity3 @entity4 ( above with daughters ) had taken his kids out for a kayak ride when the pup hopped on board the sea lion even nuzzled with @entity4 a bit before returning to the ocean ' at first it felt like he was pushing the kayak			1
we felt him back there , ' @entity4 told @entity38			2
' next thing you know , i could tell he had climbed aboard			0
' the pup , which the family decided to name @entity45 , even spent some time nuzzling with @entity4 as he quietly sat at the back of the kayak			1
' maybe he just was tired of swimming			0
maybe he was wanting to interact with people			0
maybe he just wanted to snuggle , ' said @entity50 , @entity4 's daughter			0
soon , the people around them began to take notice too , and while the sight of the pup on the kayak was exciting for them , it seems lt was too much for the baby , who soon returned back to the ocean			2
lucky for the family , the moment was all caught on video .			0
