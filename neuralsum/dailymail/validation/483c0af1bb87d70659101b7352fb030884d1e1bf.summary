a @entity1 war veteran waited 41 years until he finally came across a design that he fell in love with for his second tattoo and the social media world feels just as strongly about the new piece of body art. new zealander @entity8 was just 18 when he got his inked creation of a kiwi bird on his shoulder - and now at 52 years old he has @entity12 soldiers marching into the distance in a shape of a fern with the words ' lest we forget ' written below			1
when @entity21 , on the northeast of @entity20 , posted the design on their @entity24 page , they could never have anticipated the viral sensation caused by the emotive artwork			1
then his wife spotted the same design again on tv last week which was when he knew it was just meant to be and made an appointment last thursday for his second ' toughie sticker '			2
' i chose it for myself and nobody else - it was my way of showing respect , ' he told @entity54			0
' i did it for the old guys ( soldiers ) who do n't get much publicity - and there are not many of them left now			0
' mr @entity8 now works an ice cream salesman , but spent 18 years in the army where he met his wife - and their daughter also works for the @entity62			1
other social media users then posted their own similar designs of the soldiers the tattoo parlour will not replicate mr @entity8 's exact design again ( pictured another similar design posted ) he is flabbergasted at how his idea for the tattoo has taken off around the globe			1
' it must have hit a cord with people around the world - i could n't believe it , ' he said			0

' the photo of mr @entity8 's tattoo has so far received 130,000 likes , almost 44,000 shares and close to 5,000 comments on the tattoo studio 's facebook page			1
some decided to share their similar designs that they had inked on their skin while many others expressed that they did n't usually like tattoos but were really impressed with mr @entity8 's			2
tattoo artist @entity93 said most posts of the studio 's body artwork get about 80 likes over a couple of weeks			1
' when it got to 2,000 likes i took a screenshot , because i thought it would tail off pretty soon , ' he told stuff.co.uk			0
he said people have started asking for the same design but he would not replicate as he prefers to make unique creations			0
mr @entity8 saw the image a few months ago on a historical information board along the @entity20 waterfront where the troops left for @entity41			2
