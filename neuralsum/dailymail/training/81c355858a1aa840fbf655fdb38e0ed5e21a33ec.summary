two of @entity2 's most senior frontbenchers today angrily denied plotting against him			1
@entity3 and @entity4 were forced to issue statements dismissing reports they were planning for a ' post-miliband future '			1
the @entity9 is in the grip of panic after mr @entity2 's personal ratings plunged , and his mps fear hopes of election victory are slipping away			1
face - off : @entity4 , left , has union backing , while @entity3 , right , is the bookies ' favourits @entity2 attended the @entity19 with @entity20 last night , as speculation swirled about his future polls show mr @entity2 he is now less popular than every leader for 30 years who has taken their party to defeat in a general election , with ' depressed ' @entity13 fearing he will cost them victory in 2015			1
even @entity30 's personal ratings were better six months before he too labour to defeat			0
several senior @entity9 figures now believe the party would be performing better with almost anyone else in charge			2
last night mr @entity2 attended the @entity19 in central @entity35 , which honoured lord @entity20 , a former @entity36 actor - turned @entity37			1
however , in another incident which will have @entity13 groaning , mr @entity2 was also pictured awkwardly kissing former @entity40 star @entity39			1
mr @entity2 's fate appears to hinge on whether shadow ministers – some of whom are understood to have met privately to discuss his future – can agree on his fate and engineer a ' coronation ' rather than a divisive leadership contest with an election only months away			1
the @entity50 reported that ms @entity3 , the shadow home secretary , and mr @entity4 , the shadow education secretary , to have struck a ' non-aggression pact '			1
but a spokesman for ms @entity3 said there was ' no foundation whatsoever ' to the suggestion			0
' the spreading of lies like this only damages the @entity9 and should be seen as exactly what it is - complete and utter garbage , ' he said			0
' @entity3 , the shadow cabinet and the party are united behind @entity2 's leadership			1
' shadow health secretary mr @entity4 said : ' the stories in today 's newspapers are complete and pure fiction			1
there is not a shred of truth in them			0
' what i think it 's part of is a deliberate and desperate attempt to destabilise the @entity9 and to divide us			0
but i can say this : it wo n't work			0
we are a united team , we are united behind @entity79 ' he told @entity81 : ' my focus is on the @entity83 , exposing the damage that this government is doing and working hard to deliver the @entity9 government that this country needs and certainly that my constituency needs			0
' that is where my focus is			0
i 'm working hard to support @entity2 in every single way i can			1
' mr @entity2 also met former @entity40 star @entity39 at the party , where he was pictured awkwardly kissing the actress at the @entity9 conference in september , mr @entity2 's wife @entity94 appeared to duck away as he leant in for a kiss after his speech however , the denials will only fuel speculation about what - if anything - will be done to bolster or remove mr @entity2			1
the @entity9 leader sought to dismiss talk of a leadership coup as ' nonsense ' yesterday , as he visited @entity107 to talk about buses			2
he later told the @entity109 : ' i do n't accept that this matter arises			0
i believe that what the party wants to focus on is the country			2
' analysis of @entity116 polling dating back to 1977 by @entity117 shows how only @entity118 had worse personal satisfaction ratings than @entity2 six months before a general election former labour cabinet minister @entity121 ( left ) dismissed the leadership crisis as @entity124 bubble nonsense ' but shadow attorney general @entity125 criticised mr @entity2 's conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit critics point to mr @entity2 's disastrous party conference speech , which he delivered without notes and forgot to mention the deficit or immigration			1
shadow attorney general @entity125 today said she would not have attempted to deliver a speech of such importance without notes , but insisted mr @entity2 had kept @entity9 ' united ' and would make a great prime minister			1
she said : ' he made a mistake making a speech ... that makes someone a human being			0
he is not an automaton			0
' it was an hour - long speech			0
frankly , i would not have tried to make a 15 - minute speech of that importance without notes , but he has been doing it and he made a mistake			0
' but she told @entity150 : ' i think that he is immensely talented , he is a very nice man , he is a deep thinker , he has kept the @entity9 united , he is a man with lots of ideas and he would be a great prime prime minister			0
' last night @entity9 's election co-ordinator @entity154 issued a plea for the party to ' pull together ' , warning : ' divided parties lose elections			2
' he told @entity161 's @entity160 : ' he 's got challenges , but all of us have got challenges in every political party			2
' every one of us in the @entity9 has to reflect the reality that divided parties lose elections and we have got a profound responsibility to the people who want to get away from the mistakes , the errors , the sheer injustice of this coalition government to pull together , to offer credible change in the face of these tough economic times , and that 's exactly what we plan to do			0
' former cabinet minister @entity182 sought to calm the atmosphere , calling for an end to ' this bout of political insanity '			0
' when you are standing on the edge of a cliff it is unwise to believe that by jumping you will suddenly learn to fly , ' he told @entity191			0
former labour cabinet minister @entity121 claimed it was ' @entity193 ' which is a ' world completely remote from what is happening out there '			0
however @entity198 magazine , which backed mr @entity2 as leader , accused him of being too remote from ordinary people			1
its editor @entity201 said mr @entity2 appeared ' very much an old - style @entity202 socialist '			1
' he does n't really understand the lower middle - class or material aspiration , ' he writes			0
' he does n't understand @entity205 or woman			0
politics for him must seem at times like an extended @entity209 seminar : elevated talk about political economy and the good society			0
' writing on the @entity215 website , shadow business secretary mr @entity213 said the rumblings were ' nonsense which some in the @entity124 bubble want to distract us with '			1
mr @entity213 added : ' the simple fact is that because of @entity2 's leadership we are now within touching distance of being what many thought impossible four years ago			1
' we have a leader who has kept us united and overseen the renewal which so eluded us at the end of our time in government			2
@entity2 is an honest , sincere man of deep beliefs			1
' the runners who are lining up to replace @entity2 ... ruled himself out : @entity234 former postman @entity233 said he had no appetite for the frontbench @entity2 's position is made easier by the fact that none of his potential rivals has declared their hand			1
many mps want @entity233 , the popular former postman , to throw his hat into the ring – saying he has much greater appeal with voters than the awkward mr @entity2			1
but mr @entity233 , who served as home secretary under @entity30 , has all but ruled himself out , claiming last month that he had ' no appetite for being on the frontbench '			1
his refusal to put himself forward will force any plotters to look elsewhere			0
it seems the succession would come down to a face - off between shadow home secretary @entity3 and @entity4 , the shadow health secretary			1
the bookies are increasingly throwing their weight behind mr @entity4 , who made a well - received speech on the @entity83 at september 's @entity9 conference – in marked contrast to mr @entity2 's famously poor effort			1
it is reported that , emboldened by his conference success , he is already canvassing support ; particularly in the @entity265			0
@entity266 yesterday cut mr @entity4 's chances of leading the party from 6/1 into 4/1 to be the next party leader , as more and more political punters back him			1
the former health secretary has also gained the support of militant union leader @entity273 who said last month mr @entity4 is the person who ' most impresses ' him on the @entity9 frontbench			1
however , miss @entity3 is still favourite to take over if mr @entity2 goes ; attracting odds of 7/2			1
she can at least count on the support of her husband , shadow chancellor @entity279 , who is unlikely to have much chance of victory on his own			2
mr @entity233 is further down the betting pecking order on 12/1			0
if none of these decide to stand , it could be left to younger frontbenchers such as @entity213 ( 8/1 ) , with @entity287 and @entity288 outside bets on 16/1			0
the man who labour mps and party members wanted to be leader – @entity294 – has odds of 20/1			2
but there is no chance of him taking the reins from his brother because he has stepped down as an mp and moved to the @entity302			0
... but the rules mean it is impossible party rules say that to force out the leader , a vote of no - confidence has to be called – and the only way for that to happen is a card vote at the party 's annual conference			2
no such move was made at the last @entity9 conference six weeks ago in @entity314 and none is scheduled before may 's election			2
so it seems that those dissatisfied with @entity2 's leadership have missed their chance to force him out			2
their only hope is that the pressure becomes so intolerable that he decides to step down for the good of the party			2
this could happen if , for example , a large number of mps say publicly they want him to go			0
in that case , other candidates would be able to put themselves forward			0
to become a candidate , an mp needs the support of 15 per cent of the parliamentary party – or 39 of @entity9 's current 257 mps			2
the voting rules in a leadership contest were changed in march to a one member , one vote system for mps , meps , party members and affiliated union members .			2
