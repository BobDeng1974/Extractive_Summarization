tv chef @entity0 with one of her dishes it was about time someone addressed the problem of sodden greens , gloopy custard and crusty pasta dishes served in their hundreds of thousands every day on almost every flight path under the sun. that person is tv presenter , chef and cookery book author @entity0 who has spent the last six months working with @entity14 's in - flight catering departments to try to improve their meals			1
the upshot is a vastly superior menu for @entity14 's upper class passengers and rejuvenated meals for children throughout the cabin - but no change for those in standard class			2
@entity0 's upper class dishes – inspired by her love of healthy , light eating – will include @entity31 beef salad with roasted pine nuts and chilli dressing or a warm salmon and lentils with chorizo dish with asparagus and balsamic dressing			1
the children 's dishes , on rotation over the next 12 months , will include ' marvellous ' mac'n'cheese with pancetta pieces , crispy tender chicken strips with potato wedges and crushed peas , sweet and sour pork balls with sunshine rice and a @entity50 's chilli con carne with calypso rice			1
fine dining : @entity0 's @entity31 beef salad with pine nuts and chilli dressing which will be for upper class flyers not a soggy green in sight : the tv chef has designed four kid 's meals including mac'n'cheese with pancetta the new dishes will be showcased on @entity14 's b787 - 9 flight to @entity66 on october 23 , then added to services departing the @entity68 from october 28			1

' all of @entity0 's dishes reflect her philosophy of food , which is to champion fresh , nutritious and simple meals – something that is so important to our customers			0
' other chidlren 's options will include sweet and sour pork balls with sunshine rice ( above ) and chilli con carne @entity0 says : ' i have really enjoyed working the team at @entity14 on these dishes , which i very much hope customers will enjoy			2
the aim was to create healthy and sophisticated menus for the @entity100 customers and wholesome , delicious and fun meals for the children 's offering			2
' i think we 've achieved it – bon appetit ! ' @entity0 was keen that passengers would be ' excited by what they see '			0
she added , ' for me , when i fly , i like to have something light , healthy and with lots and lots of flavour			0
' not everyone has been enamoured by the news , however , and some have taken to @entity116 to vent their ire			0
princess @entity118 wrote underneath an announcement of the collaboration : ' so hang on , upper class get upper quality food as they can afford the upper prices ? so lower paying people are second rate and only deserve lower quality food but children of both upper and lower are the same ? ' i do n't know who i 'm annoyed at more ! ' all in a day 's work : tv chef @entity0 tucks in to the @entity31 beef salad option from her ' healthy ' for @entity14 not for all : upper class travellers will enjoy salmon with lentils , chorizo , asparagus and a balsamic dressing another , @entity139 added : ' @entity100 ... should n't we all be treated equally ... some family 's save very hard to fly with virgin for their holidays so do n't they deserve to treated as upper class ? ' @entity147 rode to the tv chef 's defence saying : ' good on you @entity0 ! love all your recipes and well written cook books			1
thank you ' whether you can afford it or not , hopefully it will inspire more airlines to up their game and is a taster of good things to come .			0
