by @entity0 black students are more likely to be suspended from @entity3 public schools — even as tiny preschoolers			1
the racial disparities in @entity7 education , from access to high - level classes and experienced teachers to discipline , were highlighted in a report released on friday by the @entity14 's civil rights arm			1
the suspensions — and disparities — begin at the earliest grades			0
in this march 14 , 2014 , file photo , education secretary @entity18 speaks to reporters during briefing in the @entity22 of the @entity23 in @entity24 black children represent about 18 percent of children enrolled in preschool programs in schools , but almost half of the students suspended more than once , the report said			1
six percent of the nation 's districts with preschools reported suspending at least one preschool child			1
advocates long have said get - tough suspension and arrest policies in schools have contributed to a ' school - to - prison ' pipeline that snags minority students , but much of the emphasis has been on middle school and high school policies			2
this was the first time the department reported data on preschool discipline			1
earlier this year , the @entity52 administration issued guidance encouraging schools to abandon what it described as overly zealous discipline policies that send students to court instead of the principal 's office			1
but even before the announcement , school districts have been adjusting policies that disproportionately affect minority students			1
overall , the data show that black students of all ages are suspended and expelled at a rate that 's three times higher than that of white children			1
even as boys receive more than two - thirds of suspensions , black girls are suspended at higher rates than girls of any other race or most boys			2
the data does n't explain why the disparities exist or why the students were suspended			1
' it is clear that the @entity3 has a great distance to go to meet our goal of providing opportunities for every student to succeed , ' education secretary @entity18 said in a statement			0
' this critical report shows that racial disparities in school discipline policies are not only well documented among older students , but actually begin during preschool , ' attorney general @entity88 said			1
' every data point represents a life impacted and a future potentially diverted or derailed			2
this administration is moving aggressively to disrupt the school - to - prison pipeline in order to ensure that all of our young people have equal educational opportunities			0
' 18 per cent of students enrolled in preschool in the @entity3 are black and more than half have been suspended at least once nationally , 1 million children were served in public preschool programs , with about 60 percent of districts offering preschool during the 2011 - 2012 school year , according to the data			1
the data show nearly 5,000 preschoolers were suspended once			2
at least 2,500 were suspended more than once			2
@entity113 , director of the @entity114 for the @entity115 at @entity116 , said the findings are disturbing because the suspended preschoolers are n't likely presenting a danger , such as teenager bringing a gun to school			2
' almost none of these kids are kids that would n't be better off with some support from educators , ' @entity113 said			0
' just kicking them out of school is denying them access to educational opportunity at such a young age			0
then , as they come in for kindergarten , they are just that much less prepared			0
' @entity113 said it 's appropriate to discipline a 4 - year - old , but a more appropriate response might be moving them to a different educational setting with additional services			2
' most preschool kids want to be in school , ' @entity113 said			0
the @entity52 administration is aiming to take away strict suspension policies keeping children from learning ' kids just do n't understand why they ca n't go to school			0
' @entity149 , co-director of the @entity150 , a think tank that specializes in social issues affecting minority communities , has been advocating against the overly zealous use of suspensions against @entity7 students			0
unfortunately , she said it did n't surprise her to hear that even younger black students were being kicked out of school at a high rate			1
' i think most people would be shocked that those numbers would be true in preschool , because we think of 4 - and 5 - years - olds as being innocent , ' she said			0
' but we do know that schools are using zero tolerance policies for our youngest also , that while we think our children need a head start , schools are kicking them out instead			0
' @entity171 , principal of @entity173 - @entity172 in @entity174 , said she 's never suspended a child in her school 's preschool program and would only consider it in an ' extreme circumstance			1
' she said her district provides behavior specialists and other services to children with discipline problems so strategies can be worked out with teachers and parents if preschoolers need additional support			0
if there are racial disparities among preschoolers disciplined , ' i do think it 's something to look it			0
i think it 's a conversation to have , ' said @entity197 , who served on a committee with the @entity199 looking at issues affecting younger school children .			0
