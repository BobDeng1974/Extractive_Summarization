when new @entity2 boss @entity1 tweeted a picture of his deserted training ground back in july , it cuttingly captured the empty feeling of those in the dressing - room			1
among that disturbed bunch was @entity9 , one of the few @entity2 players not courted by a top - four club			1
five of his comrades – @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 – had been prised away from the south coast , as had manager @entity19 , triggering talk of relegation battles and troubled times ahead			0
@entity23 ( left ) ran straight to @entity2 boss @entity1 to share his first goal for the club @entity2 captain @entity9 celebrates with @entity2 team - mate @entity27 @entity9 – signed by @entity28 five years ago with the club in @entity30 – is better placed than most to return assessment of the mood at that time			1
‘ i can not be a hypocrite and lie – yes , i was worried , everyone was worried , ’ he said			0
‘ it did not look good for us , but then when we appointed the manager it became easier			0
‘ i thought , “ well , we have lost players but we have got a very good manager ”			2
then we started signing players and my confidence grew , slowly at first then more came in			2
’ today , not one of the five who quit @entity46 ’s in the summer reside higher than @entity9 and @entity2 in the @entity47			1
the @entity2 squad celebrate during their 2 - 1 victory at @entity50 on saturday evening @entity1 saw @entity2 beat @entity51 at @entity52 to remain in the @entity47 top four this is the rather bleak picture @entity1 tweeted in the summer during the busy squad changes at the club they are third , managerless @entity59 the latest to fall victim to a playing style which marries craft , graft , silk and steel			1
there is something utterly convincing about @entity1 , too			1
he is measured but cheery with it , unflappable yet passionate			0
during one first - half incident on saturday , @entity72 caretaker @entity71 lurched over @entity74 – floored on the touchline having just made the most of a @entity78 challenge – and hurled invective at the @entity80			1
@entity1 remained stood , hands in his jacket pocket , and smiled at @entity71 when he eventually cooled , raising his eyebrows and tilting his head in a knowing manner – ‘ we ’ve got this one in the bag ’			1
summer signing @entity87 ( centre ) , in action at @entity59 , has 11 goals for @entity2 this season @entity74 , celebrating his winner against @entity51 , is another @entity1 acquisition and he was right			1
@entity23 was the two - goal match - winner			2
the troubled @entity96 winger – who played in the 2010 @entity98 final – only arrived at the club earlier this month on loan from @entity101			0
he celebrated his first goal – a low smash under @entity105 goalkeeper @entity104 – by making straight for compatriot @entity1 , the man who could well rescue his career			1
@entity107 fortuitously levelled for the hosts before @entity23 stole in to fire his second just after the hour mark			0
the victory was @entity2 ’s third on the spin away from home in the league and took them onto 42 points – ' we are staying up ' the tongue - in - cheek chant to emerge from the away end			1
left back @entity121 , tackling at @entity50 on saturday , has been in fine form under @entity1 @entity23 was the hero , but @entity1 signings @entity74 , @entity87 , @entity121 , @entity124 and @entity125 had also starred , not to mention the outstanding @entity126 , the 19 - year - old midfielder promoted from the academy this season			1
@entity2 stalwart @entity129 admitted : ‘ i did n't know much about @entity23			2
he has given us a little spurt the last two games and if he carries on like that then great			0
‘ it was a similar story with the others who came in in the summer			0
as soon as you see them in training and the quality they possess it is a good place to be at the moment			0
‘ then you ’ve got the young lads coming through , that has been a big positive			0
we had big players missing in @entity27 ( @entity27 ) and @entity145 ( @entity146 ) but @entity126 showed what he can do			0
’ @entity1 believes they can remain in the top four and qualify for next season ’s @entity150			2
on recent evidence , you would not challenge his assertion			0
rather than feeling empty , the @entity2 are bursting with confidence right now .			2

@entity2 beat @entity59 2 - 1 at @entity50 on saturday night
@entity1 *'s* side are currently 3rd in the @entity47
five *key* players left in the summer but @entity1 has *rebuilt* a fine side
