how we work out the distance of something we can hear but not see has been somewhat of a mystery - until now			0
scientists say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces			1
in a study they found that the reverberations of sound help us locate the distance of , for example , a car passing round a bend or a person nearby			1
scientists at the @entity17 say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces ( stock image shown )			1
in a study they found that the reverberation of sound helps us locate the distance of , for example , a car passing round a bend or a person nearby the research was conducted by scientists from the @entity17 and published in the @entity29			1
they said that echoes and fluctuations in volume are the cues we use to figure out the distance between us and the source of a noise			1
researchers have long understood how we can tell a sound 's direction - whether it 's to our left or right , front or back , and above or below us			2
from their heavy build and short limbs , to the shape of their skull and teeth , there are many ways that the anatomy of @entity51 differed to our own			0
now experts say that even a small bone in their ears are dissimilar to one in modern humans , raising the prospect that our extinct ancient relatives heard differently to us too			0
researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a @entity51 child , whose remains were discovered in @entity63 40 years ago			0
the remains from the two - year - old child , which are known as @entity66 8 , were discovered at @entity66 in the @entity67 , south western @entity63 , between 1970 and 1973			0
@entity68 , an @entity69 researcher at the @entity70 in northern @entity71 , produced a @entity73 computer reconstruction of the remains			0
his work , published in @entity76 , reveals another anatomical difference between the @entity51 and modern humans in the smallest ossicles of the body			2
but how we tell how far away it is had remained a mystery			0
' the third dimension of sound location was pretty much unknown , ' said dr @entity86 , a neuroscientist at @entity87			2
the researchers suspected that the effect echoes had on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound 's distance from us			1
to explore the idea , they used tiny microphones to record the sounds inside rabbits ' ears as they played sounds at different locations			0
they used these recordings to simulate modulated or unmodulated noise coming from different distances from the rabbit			2
then the researchers played the simulated sounds back to the rabbit , and measured the responses of neurons in the rabbit 's inferior colliculus ( @entity114 ) , a region of the midbrain known to be important for sound perception			2
when the rabbit heard the simulated sounds , certain types of @entity114 neurons fired more when the sound was closer - when there was a bigger difference between the sound 's maximum and minimum volume			1
the farther away the source of a sound is from a listener , meanwhile , the more echoes there are , and the more limited the changes in volume become			1
as the source moved further away , therefore , the neurons fired less and less			2
the researchers say that the effect echoes have on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound 's distance from us			1
without amplitude modulation , for example in an anechoic ( echo - free ) room , pictured , a person ca n't tell how far away a noise is from them the results suggest that , as a sound gets further away , our brains are able to work out the differences in its maximum and minimum volume - and thus its distance			1
dr @entity157 , a researcher at the @entity158 , got the same results with human volunteers			0
without amplitude modulation , for example in an anechoic ( echo - free ) room , a person ca n't tell how far away that noise is			0
' @entity165 is usually considered a bad thing , ' detrimental to hearing clearly , said dr @entity167 , co-author on the @entity17 study			1
' but it is necessary and beneficial in order to recognise distance			0
' the researchers hope to investigate the problem further , and tie together the perception of distance , horizontal and vertical directions of sound .			0

@entity17 study reveals how we can measure distances
they said that listening to echoes tells us how far something it
when a sound is close the differences in max and min volume are *obvious*
but when it is distant , our neurons fire less , and we know it is further away
