by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 12 march 2013 @entity1 could be forced to hold @entity3 elections on sundays as part of a blatant @entity6 bid to erase our long democratic tradition			1
for 72 years , elections to @entity10 have been held on a thursday , with local elections also being held on the first thursday in may			0
proposals from the @entity13 would see the @entity1 having to fall in line behind most of the continent , where elections are held on sundays			1
the plan would force @entity1 to ditch its tradition of voting on a thursday for the first time in seven decades the plan , which would come into force in time for the 2014 elections for the @entity24 , is described as a step to cement further ‘ political union ’			1
would you rather vote on a sunday , as @entity3 wants @entity1 to do , instead of a thursday ? in addition , @entity1 would also have to sit through party political broadcasts on tv to encourage them to choose the next president of the @entity13			1
the last time a @entity1 election was not held on a thursday was in 1931 – in the midst of the @entity34 – when polling was on a tuesday			1
the last vote to be held on a weekend was 1918 , when a saturday poll – the first to feature women – was held in the aftermath of the @entity40			0
the proposal is contained in a @entity13 discussion paper , the @entity41 reported			2
it said : ‘ a common @entity3 voting day with polling stations closing at the same time would better reflect common participation by citizens across the union and therefore is part of the representative democracy on which the @entity6 is founded			2
’ @entity54 mep @entity53 vowed to oppose a common voting day for euro elections the next @entity58 election is due in early june 2014			0
it had been expected that the voting dates would be between 5 and 8 june			0
the @entity1 would have expected to vote on thursday 5 june , and there were plans in train to move the local election voting day from early may to 5 june to coincide with the @entity3 vote			1
but instead , if the @entity13 gets its way , the @entity1 would vote on sunday 8 june			1
there are fears that turnout could fall if the @entity58 poll was not held on the same say as the council elections			0
@entity53 , the leader of the @entity1 @entity54 , said : ‘ we absolutely oppose a common voting day for euro elections and would be appalled if local elections were held on a different day			2
’ aside from the @entity1 , only the @entity78 vote on thursdays			1
@entity79 and the @entity80 hold the euro vote on friday			0
@entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 hold the polling day on saturday and all other 17 @entity6 countries hold it on sunday			0
@entity89 may be forced to use his veto to prevent a change in the voting day			0
the proposed plans also require @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity54 party political broadcasts to ask voters to choose between candidates for president of the @entity6 ’s @entity102 executive during euro - elections next may			1
the @entity13 proposal says : ‘ @entity3 and national political parties should make known , ahead of the elections to the @entity24 , the candidate for the function of the president of the @entity13 they support			1
‘ national political parties should ensure that their political broadcasts in view of the @entity24 elections are also used to inform citizens about the candidate they support			2
’ @entity116 , @entity95 spokesman on @entity6 constitutional affairs , said : ‘ there is no need for an elected president of @entity3 because there is no country called @entity3			0
only sovereign countries need an elected head of state , whereas the @entity6 is an international organisation			0
’ the proposal includes the requirement that national parties must state their affiliation to @entity3 political parties , which are not well known in @entity1 or elsewhere in @entity3			1
elections to the @entity24 in @entity102 are to be held in june next year ‘ national political parties participating in the elections to the @entity24 should make publicly known ahead of those elections their affiliation with @entity3 political parties , ’ the proposal says			0
‘ national political parties should prominently display their affiliation with @entity3 political parties in all campaign materials , communications and political broadcasts			2
’ under the @entity140 , the next president of the commission will be the candidate selected by the @entity3 political party with the most votes in the euro elections			1
‘ it would increase the legitimacy of the president of the commission and more generally , the democratic legitimacy of the whole @entity6 decision - making process , ’ says the proposal			2
‘ it could also contribute to raising the turnout for @entity3 elections by strengthening the link between the election of the representatives of the citizens with the selection and election process of the head of the @entity3 executive			0
’ since the first direct elections to the @entity24 in 1979 , turnout has declined in each successive vote .			0

@entity13 wants to end seven decades of @entity1 voters going to the polls on thursdays
plan would help to cement ' political union ' across the continent
