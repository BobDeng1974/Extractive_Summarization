by @entity1 reporter debate is currently raging over how some intricate and mysterious crop circles appeared overnight in a @entity5 field on monday			1
the giant markings caused believers to claim that aliens had landed in @entity9 , while crop circle experts were quick to claim that the shape , which resembles a computer chip , is a hoax			1
an anonymous video has surfaced on @entity15 that claims to show the first discovery of the circle , after two friends noticed flashing lights in a field and got out of their car to investigate			1
the first impressive pictures of the markings were taken by photographer @entity24 of the 111th @entity25 who flew over the site near @entity27 , ten miles south of @entity9			2
quite beautiful ... i believe it 's possible that aliens exist , but i do n't know if they would bother making a crop circle to give us a message			2
' the @entity15 video claims to show two men finding the markings after they witnessed green flashing lights next to the road			1
the footage shows the men leaving their car and climbing over the fence into the field			2
while the green lights flicker few more times the cameraman focuses on the flattened plants			2
at one point one of the friends says : ' dude , are you seeing this ? dude , this is a crop circle			1
' after walking in the field for a couple of minutes the men appear the panic and run back to their vehicle			0
' a friend and i were driving on @entity81 south of @entity9 , @entity5 before sunrise , and this happened , ' the @entity15 user known only as can not say commented on the video			1
view from above : aerial photographer @entity24 shot the circle from a helicopter impressive sight : ' it was beautiful			0

created this account since i do n't want this tied to me			0
still not sure what to make of it			0
' many people were not convinced that the markings were proof of an alien visitation			0
the @entity101 reported that the site was being protected by security guards on monday , but they would not name the client they were working for			0
@entity105 of the @entity106 also told the paper that there were several signs that the circles were made by human rather than extra-terrestrial life			2
@entity105 pointed out that the marking was too well aligned with the road , the center of the circle resembled braille and that the @entity15 video could have been a form of viral marketing			1
' my guess is that ... it is commissioned work for an advertisement , ' @entity105 explained to the @entity101			0
' or a commissioned work for a production company making a documentary on crop circles or for some kind of film			0
' proof ? the @entity15 video concentrated on the flattened plants in the the field that make up the crop circle			1
