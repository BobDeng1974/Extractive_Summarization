by @entity0 published : 15:52 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 23 july 2013 a web series poking fun at @entity5 's ' @entity4 ' franchise is gaining a serious following of it 's own			1
' @entity8 ' parodies the popular reality shows by pretending to profile the less glamorous women of @entity11 , @entity11 the series has skyrocketed on @entity13 where the first episode has nearly 250,000 views and some of the actors say they 've been recognized in public			1
creator @entity25 liked the sound of ' @entity23 ' and he thought a lot of people would find it interesting enough to click on			1
' first of all i thought the title would be hilarious : the @entity8			2
a lot of the urban neighborhoods in the city , the stereotype can be hoodrats and ghetto fabulous and all of that , so i thought the title would be real creative , ' @entity25 told the @entity40			2
so he made a one - off spoof @entity41 low budget video was created after a quick call for actors on @entity45			1
beauty tips : when one character complains about her earrings , another suggests using an eraser as a makeshift clasp but when that video got over a hundred thousand views , he decided to turn it into a weekly web series			1
' a lot of people on @entity13 were saying we should make it a [ series ] , ' @entity25 said			1
' i decided okay , i 'll just give them what they want			0
i 'll keep producing episodes and see what happens			1
' ' @entity23 ' follows the lives of characters called @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
the first episode features an especially funny scene where two characters go to get fake lashes and the extensions end up being almost three inches long , making it hard for the characters to see			0
looking good : @entity77 actually asked for the shorter option of false lashes cast of characters : creator @entity25 sent out a message on @entity45 asking for actors and actresses to play his funny @entity85 housewives @entity25 is aware that the show plays into stereotypes of low - income communities , but he says it 's all in good fun			2
' a lot of times , we like to laugh at our pain , ' he said			0
' i guess everything i look at , i try to find the funny in it			0
whether it 's good or whether it 's bad			0
so it 's not really to bring anybody down			0
it 's to make light of where we live			0
while some of the humor is @entity107 , the appeal of the show has spread and @entity25 says he 's gotten positive feedback from viewers all over the country			0
now @entity25 hopes to find an even bigger audience for his show			0
' hopefully it will be on a network , ' @entity25 told my @entity118 , wherever we start out it really does n't matter as long as we get on the air			0
' the second season of ' @entity23 ' premiered today on @entity13			1
read for their close - up : the ladies pose on the escalators of the @entity85 station			2
