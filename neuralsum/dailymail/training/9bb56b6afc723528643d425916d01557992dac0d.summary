sitting on the bench is never something any footballer relishes			0
but it is not normally as embarrassing as it was for the @entity6 players who took a perch for the official team photo ahead of the @entity10 final			1
captain @entity11 , manager @entity12 and @entity14 striker @entity13 were among the eight team members left red faced when the bench they were sat on collapsed as they smiled for the camera at their stadium , @entity21			1
the bench collapsed as the squad were posing ahead of their @entity10 final clash with @entity25 on november 2 the rest of the squad were in hysterics as the players who dropped to the floor were helped up the squad will hope it is not a bad luck omen ahead of the final against @entity25 on november 2 it left the rest of the squad in hysterics , but they all eventually gained their composure to have the photograph taken properly and perhaps most importantly , no players were injured from the incident			1
@entity6 are sixth in the @entity41 table with two games left to play while they are preparing for their final against @entity25 on november 2			2
@entity12 's side overcame @entity45 in the semi-final , while @entity25 's beat @entity47			0
the players regained composure and the official photograph was eventually taken , with smiles all round it will be the tenth time @entity6 have reached the final of the competition , having won it five times already			0
and manager @entity12 will no doubt be hoping his players will be wiping the floor in a different way when they take to the pitch at the @entity62 .			0
