for a split second @entity1 manager @entity0 paused , arms mid air , and then erupted as his side were denied a stonewall penalty against @entity6			2
striker @entity7 had raced behind the @entity9 defence in the 43rd minute before being clumsily brought down by @entity10 there seemed no doubt that referee @entity13 of @entity14 would award a penalty and @entity0 , gesticulating on the touchline , thought as much as well			0
up in arms : @entity1 coach @entity0 complains as his side are denied a penalty against @entity6 making his move : @entity0 charges toward the fourth official after his side were denied a penalty up in arms : @entity0 ca n't believe his side were not given a penalty speaking out : @entity0 lets rip at the fourth official during @entity1 's game with @entity6 on friday disbelief : @entity0 was up in arms at the decision of the referee contact : @entity29 crashes into @entity7 inside the box as @entity31 watches on pleading innocence : @entity29 ( right ) convinces the referee that he did not touch @entity7 ( bottom ) down but not out : @entity7 was n't given a penalty for this challenge but @entity1 still won a second later , however , his anger turned into a full blown , arm - waving rage as he realised that @entity39 had not awarded a spot kick			1

' fortunately for @entity0 and @entity1 , justice was done minutes later when @entity64 's @entity63 headed them in front			0
@entity1 managed to hold out to win 1 - 0 and sending @entity66 crashing out of the @entity55 and the group stage .			0
