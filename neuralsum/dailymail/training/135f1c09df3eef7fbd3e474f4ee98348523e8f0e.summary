if you thought memorising irregular verbs for @entity3 tests was hell at school , then spare a thought for the young inhabitants of the @entity9 island of @entity10			1
despite protests , every primary school child on the @entity13 island is required to learn an archaic whistling language called @entity16 , a version of which was once spoken by entire communities in the 16th and 17th century			1
the language consists of just two to four vowels and four consonants and employs whistling to make all of its sounds			2
by the end of the twentieth century , the whistled language was dying out			0
but @entity16 now has official protection as an example of ‘ intangible cultural heritage ’ which in part has spurred on a revival in the language			0
@entity16 originates from a more ancient version of the language called ‘ @entity16 ’ and means ‘ @entity47 whistling ’ , according to a report by @entity49			2
it was spoken in the @entity13 and whistling could be heard from @entity51 to @entity52 and from @entity53 to @entity10			0
the language , which was used by the native @entity56 people , was spoken well before @entity9 settlement but died out around the 17th century			1
it is thought the @entity56 originated from @entity59 and brought the whistled language with them			0
today however , @entity16 is a whistled form of @entity9			1
it was adopted in the 16th century after the last of the @entity56 adapted their whistled language to @entity9			1
one study showed that @entity16 is recognised in the ‘ language centre ’ of the brain by @entity16 whistlers , though regular @entity9 speakers who were not @entity16 whistlers simply recognised it as whistling			1
it is thought that the whistling language of @entity16 was developed as a form of long distance communication			1
@entity10 's landscape ( pictured ) consists of hills , valleys , and ravines and a whistle can travel up to two miles across such a landscape a call for a revival in the language in recent years has been met with mixed emotions			0
some locals think of @entity16 as a language for peasants as to why such a version of a language would originally be created at all , it ’s thought that @entity16 was developed as a form of long distance communication			1
@entity10 ’s landscape consists of hills , valleys , and ravines and a whistle can travel up to two miles across such a landscape			0
when @entity10 was largely an agricultural island , crops and herds of animals like sheep would be spread out across the hills , and herders would use the language to communicate with one another across these large distances			0
@entity16 is not the only the whistling language			2
separate languages using the mechanism of blowing air through pursed lips exists on the @entity110 island of @entity111 , in the town of @entity113 , eastern @entity114 , and in a town of the @entity3 pyrenees but @entity16 is not the only the whistling language			2

many people thought of it as a peasant language of little use to them			0
it is now taught to young schoolchildren but there are fears that public spending cuts in @entity9 will affect teaching of the language at schools			2
