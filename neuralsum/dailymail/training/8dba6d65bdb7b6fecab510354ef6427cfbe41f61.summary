by @entity0 last updated at 6:19 pm on 13th january 2012 a chicken hatchery is being sued for alleged animal abuse - after undercover footage showed hatchlings being drowned in buckets of waste and hurled into rubbish bins			1
the gruesome film , taken at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , also shows young chicks , with ripped skins and organs hanging out , being trapped under machinery			1
@entity17 - based animal protection group @entity16 , represented by the @entity18 , has filed a civil complaint with @entity20			1
but , after an investigation , @entity34 's @entity33 did not file charges			2
the group wants an end to the alleged abuse at the firm , owned by @entity41 , who is named in the suit but has not commented on the matter			1
@entity45 , litigation director for @entity18 which filed the lawsuit , told @entity47 : ' the systematic torture and reckless neglect of baby birds at @entity9 is not only shocking , it is also illegal under the @entity52			1
' and , in the lawsuit , the group stated : ' the investigation revealed that @entity57 , through its employees , operates heavy machinery in a manner that regularly mutilates hatchlings , neglects dying birds trapped in machinery or on the concrete floor			1
footage : undercover video taken at @entity9 shows young chicks being ' treated inhumanely ' , according to an animal protection group ' it drowns baby birds in buckets of waste , throws hatchlings several feet into trash bins where they remain for several hours and abuses hatchlings with excessive force by washing them down a disposal chute with a high - powered hose			1
' it also jams birds down the chute with a pole , and cruelly kills hatchlings in a crowded disposal chute in a manner that does not guarantee a humane death			0
' the lawsuit added that @entity57 hatches and ships millions of chicks each year to growers who raise the birds until they are slaughtered			1
shocking : in this segment of the video , a chick is shown drowning in a bucket according to the statement , @entity57 representatives said chicks are sent to @entity100 and @entity101			0
and they are ultimately destined for meat counters at @entity11 grocery stores			0
@entity104 added : ' there is a hard reality when it comes to factory farming			0
if you look at the video , you see the numbers of animals involved - businesses have to maximise numbers so they try to minimise labour costs			2
' the problem with factory farms is you can not have those numbers of animals being cared for by so few people without a significant number of the animals literally falling through the cracks			0
' @entity125 reported in 2010 that @entity126 president @entity41 had viewed the video and confirmed it was taken in his facility			0
he told the @entity130 tv station : ' i think the employees get desensitised to the actual handling of the bird , and for them , it 's a job			0
' he said he may make one change : ' right now , the guideline is every 30 minutes you empty those boxes , i might make it 15 and be more diligent about it			0
' @entity142 said the group has ' no reason to think the hatchery has made any significant changes			2
' the firm has 30 days to admit or deny the lawsuit 's allegations .			2
