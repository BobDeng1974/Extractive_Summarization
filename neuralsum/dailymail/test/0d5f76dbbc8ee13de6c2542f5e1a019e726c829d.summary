as @entity2 struggles with a devastating drought , huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the @entity4 — and the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations			1
a state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that supply water to arid farmland in the @entity15 and to millions of residents as far south as @entity17			0
@entity19 farmers do n't deny using as much water as they need			1
but they say they 're not stealing it because their history of living at the water 's edge gives them that right			1
still , they have been asked to report how much water they 're pumping and to prove their legal rights to it			1
gov. @entity54 has said that if drought continues this system built into @entity2 's legal framework will probably need to be examined			1
@entity19 farmer @entity39 says he has senior water rights , putting him in line ahead of those with lower ranking , or junior , water rights			1
' if there 's surplus water , hey , i do n't mind sharing it , ' @entity39 said			0
' i do n't want anybody with junior water rights leapfrogging my senior water rights just because they have more money and more political clout			1
' the fight pitting farmer against farmer is playing out in the @entity19 , the hub of the state 's water system			1
with no indication of the drought easing , heightened attention is being placed on dwindling water throughout the state , which produces nearly half of the fruits , nuts and vegetables grown in the @entity90 a large inland estuary east of @entity91 , the @entity19 is fed by rivers of freshwater flowing down from the @entity94 and northern mountain ranges			1
located at sea level , it consists of large tracts of farmland separated by rivers that are subject to tidal ebbs and flows			0
most of the freshwater washes out to the @entity104 through the @entity105			0
some is pumped — or diverted — by @entity19 farmers to irrigate their crops , and some is sent south though canals to @entity15 farmers and to 25 million people statewide			1
the drought now in its fourth year has put @entity19 water under close scrutiny			1
twice last year state officials feared salty bay water was backing up into the @entity19 , threatening water quality			2
there was not enough fresh water to keep out saltwater			0
@entity39 , a second - generation @entity19 farmer , said @entity15 farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater in june , the state released water stored for farmers and communities from @entity130 to combat the saltwater intrusion			1
@entity132 , a spokeswoman for the state @entity133 , said ' thousands of acre - feet of water a day for a couple of weeks ' were released into the @entity19			2
an acre - foot is roughly enough water to supply a household of four for a year			0
the fact that the state had to resort to using so much from storage raised questions about where the water was going			0
that in turn prompted a joint letter by the @entity133 and @entity147 calling for an investigation into how much water @entity19 farmers are taking — and whether the amount exceeds their rights to it			1
' we do n't know if there were illegal diversions going on at this time , ' said @entity132 , leaving it up to officials at the @entity160 to determine			0
' right now , a large information gap exists			0
' some 450 farmers who hold 1,061 water rights in the @entity19 and the @entity4 and @entity165 river watersheds were told to report their water diversions , and @entity167 , state water board enforcement manager , said a vast majority responded			1
state officials are sorting through the information that will help them determine whether any are exceeding their water rights and who should be subject to restrictions			2
' in this drought period , water accounting is more important to ensure that the water is being used for its intended purpose , ' said @entity147 spokesman @entity179			0
@entity39 , a second - generation @entity19 farmer whose family grows tomatoes , wheat , corn , grapes and almonds on 4,500 acres west of @entity40 , said @entity15 farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater			2
' all of a sudden they 're trying to turn their water into a permanent system and ours temporary , ' @entity39 said			2
' it 's just not going to work			0
' @entity196 farms 1,500 acres along the @entity165 in @entity197 about 100 miles south of the @entity19			0
as a senior rights holder , he figures he will receive 45 percent or less of the water he expected from the federal water project			2
on another 1,500 acres where he is a junior water rights holder , he will receive no surface water for a second consecutive year			2
' i do n't like to pick on other farmers , even if it was n't a drought year , ' said @entity196			0
' the only difference is i do n't have a pipe in the @entity19 i can suck willy - nilly whenever i want			0

as @entity2 struggles with a devastating drought , huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the @entity4
the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations
@entity19 farmers say they 're not stealing it because their history of living at the water 's edge gives them that right
@entity2 's water rights system has historically given senior water rights holders the ability to use as much water as they need , even in drought
gov. @entity54 has said that if drought continues this system built into @entity2 's legal framework could be *changed*
