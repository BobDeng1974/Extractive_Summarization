by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 13:33 est , 8 january 2014 the sun has unleashed a massive solar flare seven times the size of @entity5 from one of the largest sunspots seen on the star ’s surface			1
the stunning flare , the first major one of the year , peaked at 6:32pm gmt yesterday and follows on the heels of a mid-level flare earlier in the day			1
each flare came from a different area of a large sunspot group which @entity16 believes is the biggest seen on the sun in nearly a decade			1
the sun erupted with a powerful @entity28 solar flare on tuesday , disrupting radio traffic and sending a blast of electrically charged particles our way solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			1
their energy travels at the speed of light to reach @entity5 in just eight minutes			0
at @entity5 , a part of the atmosphere called the ionosphere absorbs it			0
harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity5 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground			1
however , when intense enough , flares can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			2
this picture combines two images from @entity16 's @entity56 captured yesterday			1
together , the images show the location of a giant sunspot group on the sun , and the position of an @entity63 flare that erupted solar flares can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere creating disruptions with signal transmission from , for example , a gps satellite to @entity5			1
another phenomenon produced by the sun could be even more disruptive			0
known as a coronal mass ejection or @entity73 these solar explosions propel bursts of particles into @entity5 's atmosphere			2
those fluctuations could induce electric fluctuations at ground level that could blow out transformers in power grids			0
a cme 's particles can also collide with crucial electronics onboard a satellite and disrupt its systems			1
this disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is on - going , anywhere from minutes to hours			2
the latest flare already delayed the launch of a private cargo ship to the @entity94 which was due to lift off today			1
commercial spaceflight company @entity95 was hoping to launch a significant cargo delivery flight to the space station with its @entity99 rocket and @entity101 spacecraft			1
the decision was made as the @entity99 rocket was awaiting launch at its pad at @entity16 ’s @entity106			1
‘ early this morning the @entity99 launch team decided to scrub today 's launch attempt due to an unusually high level of space radiation that exceeded by a considerable margin the constraints imposed on the mission to ensure the rocket 's electronic systems are not impacted by a harsh radiation environment , ’ @entity95 said in a statement today			1
the latest flare is classified as an @entity28 flare			2
x-class denotes the most intense flares , while the number provides more information about its strength			0
it is not thought to pose a threat to the six astronauts and cosmonauts living on board the @entity94 , @entity16 has confirmed			2
forecasters , however , are anticipating strong geomagnetic storm conditions to occur on january 9 and 10			0
this labeled image taken by @entity56 's @entity130 and @entity131 shows the location of two active regions on the sun , labeled @entity135 and @entity136 , which straddle a giant sunspot complex			2
a january 7 , 2014 , x1.2 - class flare emanated from an area closer to @entity136 the forecast is for a ' fairly direct ' interaction with @entity5 , anticipated to arrive in around midday in the @entity143			0
the storm may disrupt some gps satellites in its path			0
‘ the solar flux activity that occurred late yesterday afternoon resulted in an increasing level of radiation beyond what the @entity99 engineering team monitored earlier in the day , ’ @entity16 officials added			1
the sun is currently in an active phase of its 11 - year solar weather cycle			0
the current cycle , known as @entity157 , began in 2008			0
in november , the sun fired off a similarly huge solar flare causing a wide - area blackout of high frequency signal			0

the stunning flare peaked at 6:32pm gmt yesterday and follows on the heels of a mid-level flare earlier in the day
both flares came from one of the largest sunspot groups seen on our star 's surface in over a decade
@entity95 was hoping to launch a significant cargo delivery flight to the @entity94 today , but cancelled the launch
it was *concerned* about the rocket 's electronic systems would be *weakened* under the harsh radiation environment
