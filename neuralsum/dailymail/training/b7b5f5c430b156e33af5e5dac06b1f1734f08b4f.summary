@entity1 cricket is deluding itself			1
in its desire to prove @entity5 is the right man to consign the @entity7 car crash to history , it has created a fresh sequence of accidents , each more wreckage - strewn than the last			1
being bounced out by @entity11 was just about understandable , a potent mix of physics and fear			0
but @entity15 , a bowler who has spent much of his career being mocked by @entity18 fans , who has a @entity20 average in the late - 30s , and who had to be persuaded by his captain to bang it in short ? this was the kind of nadir that makes other nadirs looks like imposters			1
yet when the third test starts in @entity32 on sunday , the captain will still be @entity5 and the head coach will still be @entity34			1
success , we will no doubt be assured , will be just around the corner – a corner which has somehow become a long road to nowhere			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity5 : maybe i 'm not the right man for the job time to walk away ? @entity5 struggled again at @entity44 and is not the right man to lead @entity46 troubled : @entity5 's batting has suffered and @entity46 have not won for 10 test matches @entity5 spoke on monday afternoon of his determination to put things right and his desire to be in charge when fortunes change			1
but such things do n’t happen by themselves			0
his past record is no guarantee of success in the future			0
in fact his @entity20 average of 45.34 is at its lowest ebb for nearly four years			1
right now , the impression given by those who run the @entity1 game – from @entity68 chairman @entity67 via managing director @entity69 to @entity34 and @entity5 – is that the desire for change will in itself be enough			1
the platitudes are ringing increasingly hollow			0
it was reasonable to give @entity5 a chance to prove that the @entity77 whitewash was an outlier			2
that was his first test series defeat as captain out of six , and credit remained in the bank after the win in @entity85			1
but the second chance depended , naturally enough , on events this summer			0
that ’s how sport works			0
it is , as @entity5 might put it , a simple deal			2
all sportsmen have an internal contract : to admit to fragility is to strike at the contract ’s very essence , for half the trick is to convince yourself that you are still the man for the job			0
that ’s why there is usually a time lag between the truth dawning on outside observers and reality hitting home with the man under pressure			0
with @entity5 , we are currently mid-lag			2
this column wrote after the @entity112 defeat by @entity113 that he should no longer be captain			0
it seemed obvious then that he lacked the imagination and authority to impose himself on a game , let alone outwit the opposition			0
a few funky fields at @entity120 clouded the issue : it ’s been said often enough that such tricks are not the point of captaincy			2
and on the first day at @entity44 , @entity46 flunked it a @entity112			1
it ’s certainly true that his senior bowlers let him down			0
but good captains spot the danger and change tack			0
they have the force of personality to tell their experienced new - ball attack to pitch the damn thing up on the greenest top seen at @entity44 for decades			1
if the new - ball attack fail to respond , or refuse to pitch it up because they ’re petrified of being driven through extra cover and having their analyses damaged , then on come the change bowlers			0
the wrong men : @entity144 can not buy a run , while @entity146 ( right ) does n't need the burden of captaincy a safe pair of hands : @entity151 could be an option to return to the @entity46 set - up as captain for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin @entity158 has lapsed into all kind of strangeness during his time as @entity20 captain , but he was miles ahead of @entity5 at @entity44 , bringing on @entity163 as early as the seventh over of @entity46 ’s second innings ( he trapped @entity167 first ball ) , and instructing a reluctant @entity15 to bowl an over of bouncers just before lunch on day five ( he had @entity171 caught at short leg off the last delivery )			1
the best that can be said about @entity5 ’s leadership is that he appears to have created an environment on which newcomers feel more welcome : @entity167 , @entity178 and @entity171 have all prospered early in their careers			2
but such inclusivity can lapse into over-indulgence			0
@entity183 did n’t look fit in the first test at @entity120 , missing three catches low to his right of the kind he once had for breakfast			1
to compound the error by picking him at @entity44 , where he dropped @entity193 on the first morning , said little for @entity46 ’s judgment			1
he steps down , possibly for good , with the gratitude of @entity46 fans , but also with the suspicion that his struggles have epitomised the dressing - room ’s lack of honesty with itself			2
@entity202 not merrier : @entity34 ' second spell as @entity46 coach is proving a chastening experience then there was the general refusal to admit that @entity46 had fluffed their lines with the ball on the opening day , when @entity85 should have been skittled for 150			1
there can be no more complaints about the pitches			0
@entity5 , at least , has acknowledged that both his own lack of form and @entity46 ’s winless streak can not continue , while at the same time showing little capacity to remedy either malaise			1
things could get worse – even worse – before they get better			0
and @entity202 ? his reappointment as coach was dubious after an initial stint that included four @entity20 series defeats out of seven , including the first at home by @entity85 in 21 years			1
now , following the heist by @entity113 , he risks extending his record to six losses out of nine			0
people who know @entity34 well speak repeatedly of his enthusiasm and energy – and could n’t we all do with more of those ? but the evidence suggests that whatever it is he said he learned from his first spell in charge is yet to take effect			2
earlier this summer , @entity113 won the lone @entity241 international , the one - dayers and , for the first time in @entity46 , a test series			1
now @entity85 have won their first overseas test for three years			1
@entity46 keep ticking off the wrong kind of history			2
the danger is they will keep on making the same mistakes until the lag is no more			0
but by then , another test series will have come and gone			0
who , in any case , would replace @entity5 ? the absence of potential leaders is another poor reflection on the @entity1 game			1
@entity144 ca n’t buy a run , while the last thing a rejuvenated @entity146 needs is to be weighed down by the captaincy			0
if there is a way of squeezing @entity151 into the test team , @entity46 should seriously consider it			1
there ’s something likeable about this @entity18 team – the dash ( and tache ) of @entity272 , the old - school application of @entity274 , the classy modesty of @entity276 , the egoless line and length of @entity279			2
even @entity158 ’s rambling answers at press conferences take on a certain charm when he ’s in one of his mischievous moods			2
can @entity286 , the captain - in - waiting , concentrate on celebrating wickets with his team - mates rather than go out of his way to agitate the fallen batsman or even – as happened at @entity291 ’s yesterday – the fallen batsman ’s partner ? it ai n’t a good look			1
the agitator : @entity286 ( left ) should celebrate more wickets with his team - mates and not rile opponents what is the truth about so - called chief executive pitches and the near - mythical status of the cash - bringing fifth day ? the feeling at @entity120 was that groundsman @entity306 ’s deathly slow surface was part of @entity309 ’s grand plan to make money on walk - up ticket sales on the final day – though @entity306 was apologising as early as day one for a pitch subsequently rated ‘ poor ’ by @entity314 match referee @entity313			1
yet a senior figure at the @entity68 assured the @entity316 during the @entity317 that this was little more than ill - informed hot air			0
apparently , it actually costs a county money to host a fifth day , because grounds are rarely full , hospitality can not be sold in advance and stewards still need to be paid			0
the perfect test , we were told , finishes on day four			2
if this version is true , what happened at @entity120 was more cock - up than conspiracy			2
at a time when national boards are beefing up their online presence , the question arises about what their role on the internet should ideally be			0
are they there simply to spread information , or should they be applying a cheeky spin ? there was no doubt which angle @entity345 chose last week when they published a video detailing the lowlights of @entity183 ’s summer			0
they should be careful what they wish for : next in line as @entity46 wicketkeeper is @entity354 , a superstar in the making			1
and now he should get a decent crack at @entity20 before the 2015 ashes … superstar in the making : @entity354 will have a good crack at @entity20 before the 2015 ashes			1

@entity1 cricket creating even more havoc by backing @entity5 as skipper
for third test at @entity368 will be captain and @entity34 coach
@entity5 's @entity20 average of 45.34 is lowest for four years
@entity158 was miles ahead of @entity5 at @entity44
@entity202 ' reappointment as coach was dubious given record in first spell
@entity286 should stick to celebrating wickets with his @entity85 team - mates
ideal finish to first test at @entity120 would have been on fourth day
@entity345 should be careful - @entity354 is next up for @entity46
