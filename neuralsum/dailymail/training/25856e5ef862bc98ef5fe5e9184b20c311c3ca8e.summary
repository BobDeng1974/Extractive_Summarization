she shot to fame with her rave review of @entity3 in 2012			1
now , @entity4 , 88 , has cast her critical eye on her next fast food restaurant : @entity7 's			1
and it survived - but only just			2
the article for the @entity20 went viral , landing the grandmother a book deal and numerous tv appearances			2
in her latest piece , @entity24 : a salad to remember , @entity4 described a more sedate eating experience at the bar and grill which has 2,019 restaurants globally			1
she describes the @entity32 as ' one of those things you remember ' - but that is where the praise ends			1
readers wishing to try the dish , she warns , should opt for the $ 8.59 half - size version : ' the regular size is $ 9.99 , but you do n't need that			0
' she also turned up the chance to try their @entity46 - which she ' could do without '			0
instead , she opted for a ' small , gooey ' @entity49 , which she praised as : ' just right '			0
' @entity50 feel ' : she is sparing with adjectives but seems to commend the atmosphere of the eatery ' one of those things you remember ' : @entity4 enjoyed and remembered the half - sized @entity32 special mention goes to her waitress , @entity57 : ' none of this , “ hi , i ’m @entity60 , and i will be your server			1
” ' she was there when we needed her			0
' and @entity64 , who greets diners at the door , ' fits the neighborhood theme promoted by the restaurant '			2
an astute investigator , @entity4 gleaned some inside knowledge on how staff are trained at the eatery			1
she was - as ever - sparing with adjectives , but her tone suggested she approved			0
' they do n’t come around asking if everything is all right , ' she wrote , ' instead , one of the managers said they are encouraged to show their own personalities			0
' finally , @entity4 issues the restaurant with a report card : ' seating usually is quick in booths or at tables with windows all around			1
' menu is extensive and takes study if you are not a regular here			0
' it retains the same pensive tone of @entity4 's renowned @entity3 review , but falls short of receiving her praise			1
' just right ' : the ' small and gooey ' @entity49 hit the spot for @entity4 and her companion shunned : she decided they could ' do without ' the @entity46 on offer at the restaurant she started off her @entity3 review by calling the eatery ' impressive ' , so impressive people were queuing around the block to eat there last month			1
but no need for diners to worry , the 85 - year - old matter - of - factly points out : ' there is seating for those who are waiting			0
' she describes the decor as being ' fashioned in @entity111 farmhouse style with a welcoming entryway '			0
after asking the server ' at length ' what she would recommend mrs @entity4 decided to take her advice on the @entity118 , though chose a glass of water rather than the recommended raspberry lemonade			1
though she later told readers : ' on a hot summer day , i will try the raspberry lemonade that was recommended			0
' while waiting for her food , the writer took the time to absorb her surroundings , describing the staff 's standard white - shirt , black pants uniform and accompanying ' gold - coloured towels ' that ' adorned their aprons '			2
as for the food : ' the server first brought me the familiar @entity3 salad bowl with crisp greens , peppers , onion rings and yes — several black olives			1
' along with it came a plate with two long , warm breadsticks			0
' the chicken @entity145 ( $ 10.95 ) was warm and comforting on a cold day			2
my server was ready with @entity149 cheese			0
' after acknowledging that the restaurant had a fully - licensed bar , a fireplace that ' added warmth ' and that vases with permanent flower displays , i.e. plastic , sat on the ledges , she concludes that @entity3 is ' the largest and most beautiful restaurant now operating in @entity17 '			1
the pinnacle : @entity4 branded @entity3 ' the lagrest and most beautiful restaurant ' in @entity17 praise : the meal was ' warm and comforting on a cold day ' , @entity4 gushed to readers in @entity18 the restaurant does not need to rely on the town of 55,000 people for business as mrs @entity4 points out : ' it attracts visitors from out of town as well as people who live here			1
' speaking to @entity172 about her new - found fame , mrs @entity4 said : ' yesterday morning the phone started ringing and messages started going up , and i had no clue what it was all about			1
' these people were making fun of me … and then i thought , so what ? my son told me that it had gone viral but i did n’t know what that meant			0
' it ’s been like a three ring circus over here ever since			0
' when one blogger asked a former @entity191 editor if mrs @entity4 was sincere in her earnest review , he said : ' oh , that 's for real			1
@entity4 has been reviewing restaurants for the @entity20 for decades			2
she also writes a sort of celebrity column and has a sewage lift station named for her , as does @entity198			0
' by the way , her readers will recognize that as a fairly negative reviewsince she spent a lot more time on the ambiance than the food			0
' even outspoken chef @entity204 is a fan , tweeting to his followers today : ' very much enjoying watching internet sensation @entity4 triumph over the snarkologists ( myself included )			2
