@entity7 's staggering height means it will push past other record - setting structures , including the 1,450 - foot @entity31 in @entity32 , which will also be a residential structure once it 's complete			1
' the new height details will result in several superlatives , ' @entity11 explained			0
' @entity36 will finally retake the " tallest roof " in the @entity41 from @entity43 's @entity42 , which stands 1,451 ' , and 225 west 57th street will become the tallest residential building in the entire world , surpassing both 432 @entity39 and @entity32 â€™s @entity31			1

@entity77 101 , @entity78 : 1,670 ft ( 501m ) the most recent permits , which were partially approved on july 1st , reveal that the building could reach more than 1.2 million square feet			0

it has been designed by @entity125 , which was behind @entity71 's massive @entity70 , which is the tallest building in the world at 2,717 feet			2
still a way to go : a @entity129 view shows @entity88 where the building will be constructed ; critics complain it will cast too many shadows			0

it will measure 1,775 feet at its spire - which is 300 feet taller than anything else in @entity54 but one foot shorter than @entity2
