they say good things come to those who wait			0
but these orangutans could not be bothered with that			0
teased with a box of food that was padlocked shut , the furry animals decided to fashion tools out of twigs in a bid to break into the banquet			1
curious : as the ape tries to work out the secret to getting his snack , an equally intrigued otter watches intently the event was part of an ' enrichment exercise ' set by the zoo			1
keepers found the apes benefit from challenges which force them to come up with creative ways of attaining their goal			1
but this time , what started as a whimsical activity became the must - see event of the day for a gaggle of otters			2
novel attempts : the @entity36 orangutans first tried to get in with their hands but moved on to a stick second time lucky ? one of the apes then moves round to try the other side with a thinner twig - to no avail flocking over to the @entity44 from their own private lake in @entity36 , @entity46 , they are pictured staring intently at their neighbours ' relentless attempts to get dinner			1
while the apes are confined to their two - storey , dome - covered home , the otters are free to venture out to mingle with their fellow caged animals			1
unfortunately for the orangutans , the visitors were not much of a helping hand			0
the hungry animals start their challenge by trying to open the back of the three - tiered case of nibbles with their hands			2
audience participation : determined to complete the task , the orangutan does n't spot an otter putting his paw in when that fails , they take to the door of the box with a stick			2
hitting a wall once more , they move round , peering in and repositioning their tool countless times			0
the otters are enthralled by the mission			0
after watching from afar , some approach the stone pedestal to join in , peeking round at the apes while seemingly trying their own luck at opening the box on the other side .			0

@entity36 keepers set the apes the task as an ' enrichment challenge '
the animals made tools out of twigs to get their dinner from a padlocked box
otters from a neighbouring lake in the *compound* *marvelled* at the activity
