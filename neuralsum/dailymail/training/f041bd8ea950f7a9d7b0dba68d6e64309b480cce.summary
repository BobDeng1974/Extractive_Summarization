@entity1 supporters are the latest to confirm their opposition to the idea of taking @entity5 games overseas after @entity7 fans also revealed their disapproval at the proposal			1
the plan has crept back on to the agenda , six years after it was first mooted and rejected in the face of intense criticism , with a few slight alterations , such as taking one of the original 38 games abroad , rather than adding a 39th			1
fans in the @entity19 were quick to register their disapproval of the new proposal and they have been joined by @entity1 's @entity22 ( @entity23 )			1
@entity1 fans at @entity26 - some supporters voiced concerns over @entity5 games overseas ' the integrity of @entity31 football is at risk , ' said a @entity23 statement			1
' as ever it seems as if those at the top are focused purely on short - term cash over the long - term interests of the game			0
' with clubs continually pressing the loyal , match - going support for more and more money - despite the huge amounts now coming into the game from commercial and television contracts - it is important that those running our clubs , and the @entity50 , see sense in this matter			0
' the @entity31 football leagues are loved across the globe			1
as the country which brought the beautiful game to the world , we have a long standing history of passionate , honest competition that has received millions of admirers at home and abroad , over many years			0
@entity1 fans have joined their @entity7 counterparts in opposing the proposal to play @entity5 matches abroad ' this integrity will be shattered if the @entity5 is allowed to ratify competitive matches overseas , which are designed purely as a money making exercise			1
' in the interests of fair competition we also question how the idea of a 38th match overseas will work			0
playing one round of competitive matches at neutral venues will mean one less home match for at least 10 @entity5 teams , and with that there is the loss of advantage in home support			2
does that really work in the interests of fair play ? ' supporters are also concerned about the knock - on effect on ticket prices and the increasing trends to accommodate corporate interests , television and far - flung fan - bases which are draining atmosphere from @entity31 grounds			2
@entity7 fans waiting outside @entity26 for the team bus to arrive ahead of the @entity1 game ' it should never be forgotten that match - going fans are the life and soul of our game , ' the @entity23 statement continued			1
' we appreciate that monster commercial and television contracts have ensured the @entity5 and its clubs are rolling in cash and that there is less reliance on income from ticket sales , but without the attendance and passion of the fans at matches , the @entity5 would have no brand to sell			2
' while it 's fantastic that the @entity5 has acquired millions of new fans across the globe , the idea of playing a round of matches abroad and the associated issues that come with it , could be disastrous			1
' let alone the immorality of tweaking the competition 's rules purely as a means to bring in even more cash , with the complexity and problems that overseas matches could bring , certain clubs also stand to lose millions of pounds bearing in mind one decision or a single goal under enforced different circumstances could mean missing out on @entity141 qualification , or relegation			0
' @entity1 have plenty of supporters overseas , including these @entity145 in @entity146 the @entity19 statement was along similar lines : ' the @entity19 board notes with deep concern the re-emergence in the media of the ‘ overseas @entity5 game ’ idea			1
we see this concept as fundamentally flawed for a number of reasons and oppose its introduction to top flight football in @entity31			1
' the 39th game idea ( an extra @entity5 game to be played overseas ) which was first mooted and widely condemned in 2008 and then subsequently shelved by the @entity5 has , inevitably , re-emerged under a new guise , whereby it is apparently proposed that one of the 38 games each @entity5 team plays would be played overseas			1
' playing a fixture overseas would inevitably impact on the integrity of the @entity5			2
playing football in a different climate and time zone could potentially impact on a team 's performance			0
" home " advantage would also disappear , giving those clubs playing a nominal " away " game an advantage across the season , as such games would essentially be played on neutral grounds			0
