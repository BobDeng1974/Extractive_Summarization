questions emerged today over the reasons behind the departure of @entity4 weathergirl @entity3 from the channel after 24 years			1
ms @entity3 , who at 56 was @entity6 's longest - serving female forecaster , has not presented the @entity4 weather since february			1
despite having done the job for the broadcaster since 1990 , the year after the @entity8 was created , she left quietly and without any announcement			2
viewers have taken to online forums to ask what has happened to the popular presenter			0
one wrote : ' any ideas where @entity3 has vanished to ? ' she has n't been on @entity4 for around six months now but is still very active on her weathergirl website			2
' perhaps long term sabbatical ? or has she left @entity4 altogether ? another questioned whether ageism was an issue , with one writing on a popular television forum : ' surely this is not an ageism issue ? ' i would have thought senior and experienced presenters would be just what a broadcaster would want , not kids fresh out of school			1
' in february , the month ms @entity3 left her weather job at @entity4 , the @entity41 star wrote a blog for @entity44 that now reads like a swansong for her career at @entity4			1
paying tribute to veteran presenters @entity49 and @entity50 , she wrote : ' they taught me so much ... ' ms @entity3 had a well - publicised engagement with @entity53 mp @entity52 , right , which ended in 2006 ' in this age of blatant lookism , they were totally themselves			1
' they had no interest in polishing their egos , only in focusing on delivering the most accurate forecast possible ... ' @entity4 will never see their likes again			0
' as a compatriot of mine once sang : those were the days my friends ... '' in an article written a couple of years previously , @entity67 referred to herself as a ' survivor ' in a world where ageism was ' prevalent ' , and insisted she would work ' til i drop '			0
she wrote : ' there is no doubt that ageism is prevalent in tv , way more so than in society at large			0
' as for me , i intend fighting fire with fire and working till i drop			0
i shall be happy when they start calling @entity81 , and when they dare put a female with as big a belly as @entity85 on the @entity86			0
' her heyday : ms @entity3 , pictured presenting the weather in 1999 , became a popular and experienced presenter today , a spokesman for @entity4 was quick to deny that ms @entity3 's departure from @entity4 had anything to do with her age			1
he said : ' as both @entity4 and @entity3 have stated , she has moved on to pursue new opportunities			2
' to claim that her departure has anything to do with her age is complete nonsense			2
' ms @entity3 's agent @entity99 told @entity100 that ms @entity3 , who was engaged to @entity53 mp @entity52 before marrying motor - racing entrepreneur , @entity103 in 2007 , had ' moved on '			1
he said : ' @entity3 has been busy filming for a number of shows on @entity4 , @entity106 and @entity107 and doing a number of corporate and charity related events so that has been keeping her very busy			0
' @entity107 and @entity111 are also working with @entity3			0
' ms @entity3 has been happily married to motor - racing entrepreneur @entity103 , pictured , since 2007 he added : ' @entity3 has been a long - standing @entity112 presenter , and is now moving on from presenting the weather on @entity4 , after more than 20 years to pursue these opportunities			1
' but mr @entity99 did not respond to questions over whose decision it was for the veteran weathergirl to leave @entity4 , or whether her age had been a contributing factor			2
ms @entity3 also runs her tvweathergirl.com website and does corporate work .			0

an @entity4 weathergirl since 1990 , she 's @entity6 's longest - serving female forecaster
