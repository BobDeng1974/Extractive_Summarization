by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 02:49 est , 14 december 2012 free speech campaigners have hailed a vote by the @entity3 to scrap a draconian law that made it a crime simply to insult someone			2
the controversial legislation led to countless arrests of ordinary people for making jokes and expressing opinions about religion and sexuality			0
an amendment to strike out the term ' insult ' by @entity17 , a crossbencher and former @entity20 chief constable , was backed by 150 votes to 54 section 5 of the @entity23 criminalised ‘ insulting ’ words and behaviour – without defining what the term meant			1
critics warned that over- zealous police and prosecutors were abusing the law , leading to ludicrous scenarios such as the conviction of a teenager for saying ‘ woof ’ to two dogs			1
an amendment to strike out the term ‘ insult ’ by @entity17 , a crossbencher and former @entity20 chief constable , was backed by 150 votes to 54 late on tuesday			1
the move was backed despite the @entity42 and @entity43 peers opposing the change			1
@entity45 banded with rebel lords from across the parties and crossbench peers to vote for the change			0
lord @entity17 said : ‘ we must never lose sight of our basic constitutional freedoms within the law which are so important in any civilised country			1
‘ that ’s why the vote was so important in upholding and enhancing one of those basic freedoms			2
’ @entity59 , of @entity60 and campaign director for @entity62 , said : ‘ we are delighted the @entity3 has voted to enhance free speech for everyone by reforming @entity62			2
‘ the vote will encourage everyone who believes in robust debate , especially those who feel free speech has become less free in recent years			2
‘ we now wait to hear whether the government will try to overturn this vote in the @entity69			2
’ the amendment was passed by the @entity3 as part of the @entity72			0
it will still need to go through the @entity74 for approval , however , and will need government backing to become law			0
a senior mp told the @entity79 had become hesitant to change the law following the ' plebgate ' row involving former international development secretary @entity81 last night , the @entity82 said it was ‘ considering ’ the arguments for change and ‘ will reflect on the @entity3 ’ decision ’			1
a spokesman added : ‘ the government supported the retention of @entity62 as it currently stands , because we believe it is wrong to swear at police officers			0
’ the @entity82 launched a consultation on repealing section 5 in january , but no decision has yet been reached about whether it will back the change			1
one senior mp told the @entity79 the @entity82 had taken an unusually long time to deliberate and had ‘ become hesitant ’ to change the law following the ‘ plebgate ’ row involving former international development secretary @entity81			1
the mp said : ‘ until @entity81 ’s plebgate , we thought the @entity82 and police could work this out and agree to drop it			0
but @entity104 did not want to be seen undermining police in the wake of that			0
’ mr @entity81 was accused of swearing at police officers outside @entity109 when he was asked to get off his bicycle			0
but the intervention last week of the @entity112 will heap pressure on the government to back the change			0
@entity116 , the @entity117 , said the law could be ‘ safely ’ amended while still protecting vulnerable people from harassment under existing laws			1
police used @entity62 to pursue the following cases			0

section 5 of the @entity23 criminalised ‘ insulting ’ words and behaviour
but it had not defined what the term meant , leading to an abuse of the law
