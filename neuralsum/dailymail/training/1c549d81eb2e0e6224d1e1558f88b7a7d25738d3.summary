by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 27 april 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 27 april 2012 a nuclear power plant has been forced to shut down because of an infestation of jellyfish - like creatures			1
@entity4 , in @entity5 , was completely closed yesterday after a swarm of salp was found clogging filters meant to keep marine life out and the unit cool			1
the slimy sea creatures were discovered as part of the @entity15 plant 's routine monitoring system			2
shut down : @entity4 , in @entity5 , was completely closed yesterday after a swarm of salp was found clogging filters meant to keep marine life out and the unit cool @entity19 , senior communications manager , said : ' we made the conservative decision to ramp down the affected unit to 20 per cent and continued to monitor the situation			1
' when the problem continued , we made another conservative decision that it would be safest to curtail the power of the unit			0
' safety is the highest priority			0
we will not restart the unit until the salp moves on and conditions improve			0
no priority is more important than safe operation of our facility			0
' the @entity37 plant consists of two units and provides around 2,300 megawatts of power - enough to put the lights on in 1.5million homes			1
@entity42 locked down : the slimy sea creatures were discovered as part of the @entity15 plant 's routine monitoring system unit 1 was shut down previously because of refuelling and maintenance work and will not be functional for several weeks			0
small barrel - shaped translucent plankton - eating organism that can rapidly reproduce similar to jellyfish they can grow to nearly four inches in length found in warm seas , they are more common in the southern hemisphere as filter feeders , they pump water through a mucus net in their hollow bodies to trap microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton move by pumping water through their bodies and float in the water not considered threatened now that @entity71 has been shut down because of the influx of salp , the @entity70 plant has ceased all production			2
the shutdown leaves @entity5 , at least temporarily , without nuclear power generation - which usually accounts for 14 per cent of the state 's electricity supply			1
but even with the @entity4 plant out of commission , @entity15 has pledged to continue production using other sources of power so that customers are unaffected by the closure			1
the @entity87 nuclear plant , between @entity88 and @entity89 , has been closed since january			2
operator @entity90 is trying to solve the problem of ' unusual , rapid degradation ' of tubes inside recently replaced steam generators			0
@entity19 added : ' we 've had salp cling to the intake structure before , but nothing to this extent			0
' and he said that the plant would simply have to wait until the salp move on before they can resume production once the filers are clear .			2
