a little lie and a lot of ibuprofen is all a contagious @entity4 patient would need to sneak out of @entity5 and into the @entity6 , a public health watchdog warns			1
nearly all of the screening that prevents people with the deadly disease from traveling the world is done in @entity4 - stricken @entity5 nations by screeners at airports there			1
before being allowed to board a plane , travelers in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are given temperature scans to check for fever and asked whether they have had contact with anyone who was sick with @entity4			1
it 's a system that 's far from fool - proof and is easy to defeat , @entity25 , president of @entity26 , a biosafety company based in @entity27 , says			0
' and people can take ibuprofen to reduce their fever enough to pass screening , and why would n't they ? if it will get them on a plane so they can come to the @entity6 and get effective treatment after they 're exposed to @entity4 , would n't you do that to save your life ? ' on thursday , @entity17 said the first @entity4 patient to be diagnosed in the @entity6 had lied on a questionnaire at the @entity65 airport about his exposure to an @entity4 patient			1
he flew to @entity68 and then @entity70 airport outside @entity71 , before landing in @entity72 on sept. 20			0
the traveler , @entity44 , had no symptoms when he left @entity17 , and fever scans there had shown a normal body temperature of 97.3 degrees @entity74 , @entity6 health officials said			1
he therefore could not have been identified through examination as carrying the ebola virus			0
his arrival and hospitalization in @entity72 have underscored how much @entity6 authorities are relying on their counterparts in @entity5 countries to screen passengers and contain the worst @entity4 outbreak on record			1
part of the screening burden rests on connecting airports			2
for example , @entity47 flew from @entity65 to @entity94 to @entity95 to @entity27			0
he was fever - screened in @entity65 and @entity94 , but not @entity95 's @entity97 , he said , and not when he arrived in @entity27			2
@entity44 was allowed into the @entity6 after he came in close contact with a pregnant woman who died of @entity4 ' at @entity97 , there were no questions about where i had come from , ' he said			1
' i offered the information to the official in @entity27 , and he said , ' thank you			0
'' in august , experts from the @entity6 @entity107 ( @entity107 ) began teaching airport workers in @entity65 and other cities in the ebola zone to conduct screenings , @entity107 medical worker @entity106 said in an interview			2
ebola cases and deaths have been reported in @entity19 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity116 and @entity117			2
the @entity118 has put the death toll at 3,338 out of 7,178 cases since march			0
the @entity107 also worked with @entity17 authorities to develop the questionnaire that was completed by @entity44 : before travelers enter @entity124 in @entity65 they are asked if they have had contact with anyone showing symptoms of @entity4			1
there are at least two other screening points before a passenger is allowed to board a plane , with trained airport personnel asking about exposure to @entity4 in the previous 21 days and any symptoms including fever , severe headache , bleeding , vomiting , diarrhea , and abdominal pain			1
this process relies on an honor system , @entity106 said			0
officials at the @entity107 and the @entity142 would not say if they are considering using hand - held fever detectors on passengers arriving at @entity6 airports			1
but @entity142 spokeswoman @entity146 said the agency ' will not hesitate to execute additional safety measures should it become necessary			0
' @entity107 director dr. @entity149 cautioned on thursday that a more restrictive approach to travel could make the @entity4 outbreak harder to contain			2
' the approach of isolating a country is going to make it harder to get help into that country , ' he said			0
fever detection virologist @entity159 of the @entity160 has studied @entity4 for years and helped develop an experimental @entity4 vaccine			2
he told @entity162 in september that airport screeners in @entity65 , where he spent three weeks , ' do n't really know how to use the devices			0
' he said he saw screeners record temperatures of 32 degrees @entity168 ) , which is so low it ' is impossible for a living person			0
' @entity159 said in an email that according to his colleagues who have returned from @entity17 in the last few days procedures for taking temperatures and doing clinical checks have improved			0
since august , major @entity6 airports that receive international flights have displayed signs alerting passengers to the presence of @entity4 in @entity5 and telling them to be on the look out for symptoms , said @entity185 ( @entity185 ) spokeswoman @entity184			1
on wednesday , customs personnel began distributing information prepared by the @entity107 describing @entity4 symptoms and noting , ' you were given this card because you arrived to the @entity6 from a country with @entity4			1
' it tells travelers that if they were exposed to @entity4 overseas , ' call your doctor even if you do not have symptoms			0

public health watchdog says @entity4 patients could use ibuprofen to lower their fevers so that they can pass through airport *checkpoints*
nearly all of the screening is done by staff in ebola - stricken nations using hand - held temperature scanners
the scanners can be tricked with drugs that lower fever
the first @entity6 @entity4 patient , who arrived on a plane after flying out of @entity17 , has *sparked* calls to tighten screening for the disease at @entity6 airports
@entity44 lied on a form when he said he had not been in contact with anyone sickened with @entity4
