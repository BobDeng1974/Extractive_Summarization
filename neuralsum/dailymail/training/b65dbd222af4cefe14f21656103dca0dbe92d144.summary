by @entity0 @entity1 have admitted letting receptionists act as ' telephone triage ' to decide which patients get urgent appointments , according to a new survey @entity1 have admitted letting receptionists act as ' telephone triage ' to decide which patients get urgent appointments , according to a new survey			1
one in eight practices admitted using the untrained practice staff to determine who needs to be seen first and who can wait			0
while most surgeries use such triage systems - which help ensure those who are most in need are prioritised - the decision is usually made by clinically trained staff who have been taught to recognise the key signals or alarm bells			0
the survey of @entity1 , nurses and practice managers revealed that 13 per cent of surgeries allowed receptionists to take the decision - sometimes with no input from a professional medical senior , the @entity22 reports			1
the survey was carried out by @entity32 , a clinical research and publishing company			1
it also found that almost half of @entity37 practices who use ' phone triage ' did not give their staff training in how to identify serious symptoms , which required urgent care			2
it comes as doctors said they were wasting time seeing patients who did not need an appointment			0
they told researchers that six patients a day were taking up appointments at the average family practice , who could have been treated elsewhere or at home			2
@entity32 estimated the time wasters cost the @entity55 Â £ 1billion a year across almost 64,000 @entity57 practices			1
@entity58 , chief executive of the @entity59 told the paper she was deeply concerned about the rising trend which she said was ' becoming more widespread			0
' she added : ' @entity63 ' lives are put at risk by decisions to cut costs in this kind of way ; there is a huge risk of symptoms being missed when the assessment is being made by an un-trained person who ca n't even see the patient			0
' gps told researchers that six patients a day were taking up appointments at the average family practice , who could have been treated elsewhere or at home dr @entity80 , chairman of the @entity82 's gp committee added that receptionists should never be asked to take on responsibilities requiring clinical judgement			1
examples of patients who did not need appointments were those with minor ailments , and those seeking antibiotics needlessly and requesting repeat prescriptions , which can be arranged by clerical staff .			0
