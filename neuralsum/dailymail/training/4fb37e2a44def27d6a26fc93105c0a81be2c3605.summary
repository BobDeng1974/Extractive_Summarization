by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 28 july 2012 hundreds of @entity2 spectators were turned away from one of the @entity5 ' first events today after a ticketing mix - up before the archery			1
@entity2 fans had streamed towards @entity10 's cricket ground early this morning for an event widely advertised as one of the first of the @entity5 , only to be told it was a behind - closed - doors competition			1
dozens of would - be spectators were left angry and frustrated , having thought they could attend a free and unticketed pre-competition ' ranking event '			2
the confusion led to frustration among fans , some of whom had travelled from abroad especially for the archery , only to be denied entry			1
a queue of over 50 fans had gathered outside @entity10 's by 8am this morning , with dozens more who arrived before the 9am start hoping to get in on a ' first come first served ' basis			1
some fans even produced what they thought were genuine tickets , purchased from a fraudulent unofficial website			1
among those turned away were four devastated archery fans from @entity57 , who had travelled to @entity58 solely for today 's ranking event			1
early starters : the archery ranking event which began at 9am this morning had been wrongly advertised as a ticketed event by some unofficial websites going for gold : @entity66 pair @entity65 and @entity67 were among those taking part in the event at @entity71 today missing out : @entity72 and @entity73 , left , along with @entity75 @entity74 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
right , were among those left disappointed after not being allowed into @entity10 's the four men , part of an amateur archery team , were devastated after dashing to the cricket ground from @entity83 following a 16 - hour flight from their homeland just to see the one event			1
speaking on behalf of the men , two of whom were wearing special @entity2 t - shirts , volunteer guide @entity92 said : ' they have come from @entity57 all the way for this			2
' they are very upset - they do n't have tickets to see any other events			2
' she added : ' these guys have just come off a 16 hour flight at @entity83 this morning and rushed to get here in time			0
then the security guard tells us that there 's been a miscommunication and non-ticketed also means not open to the public			0
' there are people from all over the world turning up here today - it 's not good enough			2
' there was further confusion as other events , such as the cycling road race and marathon running , allowing spectators to watch for free			0
royal approval : @entity66 competitor @entity65 takes a break in the @entity31 event , which was also watched by @entity120 false : several ticket sites , such as @entity123 , confused fans by appearing to offer tickets for sale for the behind - closed - doors archery event today mix - up : another website claiming to sell tickets , @entity131 , also appeared to offer admission to the competition today many had assumed the archery was following a similar set - up , but the ranking event eventually went ahead with only members of the media watching			1
one spectator , @entity140 , had flown in from @entity141 especially for the event			0
the red - faced blunder for @entity28 at @entity71 was the latest of several slip - ups by organisers before the @entity146			2
on wednesday , video producers sparked a diplomatic row by mistakenly displaying a @entity150 flag during the warm - up of @entity153 's women 's football match at @entity154			0
the incident saw @entity153 's players walk off the pitch in protest , before the glitch was fixed an hour later			0
it is thought a video producer in @entity58 - who has since offered to resign - was at fault for the gaffe			2
and just yesterday , @entity2 programme producers referred to @entity167 footballer @entity166 as being @entity168			0
he told @entity169 : ' there are some good @entity141 in the archery and i came especially for this day when i saw it advertised as free			2
' this is all i have come over for			0
' @entity28 's @entity10 's venue manager @entity175 said : ' this has always been a non-ticketed event but it seems some people believed they could come down on the day			1
' this was never the case but we believe some illegal websites may have suggested this was the case			0
' @entity185 , venue general manager for @entity28 , added : ' it ’s a mistake			2
we are not licensed today			0
we had never intended to have spectators here and we can not allow any in			0
' we will look into the communications side and i appreciate that this is not an ideal start			0
i think the publicity has taken on a snowball effect			0
' it is unclear from which websites spectators had bought tickets which they produced at @entity71			0
a spokesperson for the cricket ground declined to comment			0
a @entity28 statement later added : ' we think we have made it very clear that this is not a free event , like the @entity207 which have been advertised as free events			1
' this is a ranking round and there is no spectator access at all			0
' we are dealing with this at the venue , along with some people who have turned up with fake tickets purchased from a fraudulent website			2
' tickets have not been advertised or sold by @entity28 for the @entity31 ranking event which starts today at @entity71 we have always made it clear that the preliminary rounds are not open for spectators			1
warning : bosses at @entity71 were forced to issue this tweet stating that tickets were not available for the event this morning world beater : @entity227 , who is legally blind , celebrates after setting a new world record in the men 's ranking event this morning ' there are a number of unofficial websites claiming to sell tickets , we therefore advise people to be extremely cautious and vigilant when attempting to buy tickets and only purchase from an official source – if in doubt there is a url checker on our website which will identify official sources			1
' even more frustratingly for the fans , the ranking event saw two world archery record smashed - including one by a competitor who is blind			1
@entity150 have claimed the first two world records of @entity248 in the men 's archery ranking round			1
im dong - hyun broke his own individual record for 72 arrows and joined @entity254 and @entity255 to set a new team mark for 216 arrows			0
video : mix - up disappoints archery fans ahead of @entity5 start ...			1
