by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 30 october 2013 flying marvel : pilot @entity5 , clutching champagne after a historic @entity4 test flight in 1960 , amassed an archive over thirty years of flying the jet a huge collection of artefacts amassed by the first man to fly supersonic @entity4 across the @entity11 in less than three hours has been released for the first time today			1
@entity13 test pilot @entity5 created an archive charting his thirty year career , which includes a short note about its historic first flight over @entity13			1
the handwritten log , from april 9 , 1969 , reads simply : ' type ( of plane ) : concorde - pilot : self ' , and describes how he took off in @entity4 from @entity22 near @entity23 and landed at @entity24 in @entity25			1
this blunt description was in sharp contrast with what he told reporters after landing , describing the flight as ' wizard - a cool , calm and collected operation			1
' behind the scenes there were concerns over the safety of the craft , with pilots and crew having to wear air - ventilated suits and parachutes in case they had to jump out			2
his collection of documents , photographs and medals also contains all his log books covering his decades of service , which included six years of test flights before it was used as a passenger aircraft			1
the late airman 's job was to put @entity4 through its paces , criss - crossing the globe at twice the speed of sound before the plane entered commercial service in 1976			0
his work to get the @entity4 project off the ground earnt him the cbe and a long - time friendship with prince @entity65			0
his family are now selling his extensive archive of material relating to the dropped - nose plane including his valuable log books that cover the momentous first flight			1
the plane was a favourite with the super-rich because it could fly from @entity99 to @entity100 in less than three - and - a - half hours			1
but the planes - built as part of an @entity103 and first flown in 1969 – were long dogged by controversy and never really became profitable			0
the main problem arose from the sound of its sonic boom – the loud noise left its wake made when the aircraft broke through the sound barrier			0
by the early 1970s , @entity4 had been banned from flying at high speed in most countries throughout the world			0
only 20 aircraft were ever built - and these were sold at a cost subsidized by the @entity118 and @entity13 governments to the formerly state - owned @entity119 and @entity120			1
development of the planes was prohibitively expensive , so its only crash – outside @entity124 on july 25 , 2000 – sounded the death knell			0
though @entity129 flew again , the cost of improvement in a post- 9/11 world became too much to bear and its retirement flight was made on november 26 , 2003			0
the collection includes @entity5 's medals , trophies , presentation plaques and bowls , his @entity4 flight case and hat and a @entity4 visitors book signed by @entity139			1
there are also scores of congratulatory letters sent to him as well as photos of @entity5 with royalty including @entity144 and of him in the @entity4 cockpit with prince @entity65			2
a rare signed photo of astronaut @entity147 giving the thumbs up and stood next to @entity5 is also for sale			2
and a weather vane with a @entity4 model on top that @entity5 attached to the roof of his house in @entity155 , @entity25 , for years makes up the £ 50,000 collection			1
the sale has come about because @entity5 's elderly widow @entity158 has just moved into a smaller home and no longer has the space for it			1
it is being auctioned by @entity164 auctioneers of @entity165 , @entity166			0
mr @entity164 said : ' in the 1960s @entity5 was every schoolboy 's hero			2
' he was the chief test pilot for @entity169 's @entity147 and worked on the development of aircraft like the @entity173 v - bomber and the @entity174			2
' he was selected to be the chief test pilot for @entity4			0
' the development of supersonic transport started in the early 1950s so by the time it was ready to be tested in 1969 it was a huge event			0
' there ca n't be another set of logbooks post-war , 20th century , that are more important than these			0
' @entity5 wanted to be a pilot from the age of 10 and joined the @entity186 towards the end of @entity188 , flying @entity190 bombers over @entity191			1
he joined @entity192 as an experimental pilot in 1950 and 19 years later made history by piloting @entity4			0

@entity4 entered commercial service in january 1976 when @entity120 flew to @entity234 and @entity119 to @entity235 simultaneously			0
@entity5 ended his career as divisional director and general manager of the @entity22 works of @entity240 in 1986			1

mr @entity164 said : ' @entity5 's wife is downsizing and these items have been languishing in cupboards			2
she could n't take it with her and thought it would be best to offer them to enthusiasts			0
