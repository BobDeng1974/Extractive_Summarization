by @entity1 reporter published : 21:10 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 07:28 est , 8 january 2014 no sooner had @entity4 co-founder @entity3 launched his latest app on tuesday than some smart alec had used it to capture a cheeky photo of @entity9 ceo @entity8 texting and driving at the same time			1
jelly allows users to take a photo and then ask their network of friends on @entity9 and @entity4 about it in much the same way as you would use a search engine			2
some critics are less than impressed , calling it a ‘ vanity project ’ , but one user @entity20 was quick to put it to good use and posted his photo of the @entity9 founder along with the words ' @entity25 texting and driving			1
@entity32 's free app for iphones and @entity35 phones allows people to tap into the collective knowledge within their @entity4 and @entity9 networks to find answers about things that puzzle them			1
the questions are accompanied with a photo taken of an object that triggered the curiosity of the app 's user			2
@entity4 and @entity9 friends must also have the @entity32 app to see the questions			1
but those friends can then forward the questions to others who might know the answer , even if they do n't have the app. @entity4 co-founder @entity3 , right , launched @entity32 on tuesday , while @entity25 , left , reportedly drives to work every day in a $ 40,000 black @entity29 although @entity3 believes @entity32 can grow into an ‘ awesome business , ’ @entity3 doubts he would have tackled the challenges of building another start - up unless he believed it could help teach people that computer - driven algorithms do n't necessarily have all the answers in life			1
‘ if we are successful , then we will be introducing into the daily muscle memory of a whole lot of people this idea of , “ how can i help someone today ? ” ’ said @entity3			0
‘ maybe we can sort of nudge up the global empathy quotient so people start thinking about other people a little more			0
’ but some critics are n’t so sure , @entity72 has described it as ‘ an app for the sake of apps ’ , a ‘ software @entity77 ’ and a ‘ vanity project			0
’ ‘ have you ever posted on @entity9 , asking if anyone knows a good barber ? or tweeted to your followers asking if " @entity84 " is any good ? that 's jelly - a search engine that uses your friends - only more convoluted than ever before , ’ wrote @entity72 ’s @entity87			2
@entity20 was quick to put the @entity32 app to good use and posted his photo of the @entity9 founder along with the words ' @entity25 texting and driving			1
how do you respond ? ' @entity3 , 39 , can afford to gamble on a company with an altruistic bent after @entity4 's successful public stock offering two months ago			0
@entity4 's stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price of $ 26			0
just how many millions @entity3 has made from @entity4 remains a mystery because he did n't own enough stock for his stake to be disclosed in regulatory filings			0
he has also persuaded former vice president @entity103 and @entity105 lead singer @entity104 to invest , as well as @entity106 , who became a billionaire as co-founder and chairman of professional networking service @entity110 the venture capital firm @entity112 also has invested an undisclosed amount			0
eventually , @entity32 's app will extend its reach into other online networks besides @entity4 and @entity9 , @entity3 said .			2

@entity9 ceo @entity25 was caught texting and driving on his way to work on tuesday morning
@entity20 *photographed* @entity25 and posted it on @entity32 , a new app for *sharing* photos with your friends
' @entity25 texting and driving . how do you respond ? ' wrote @entity20
@entity25 drives a $ 40,000 black @entity29
