by @entity0 nestled among horrific footage of the @entity3 crash and a woman imprisoned in an underground room are bizarre , forgotten pieces of history - including a 10 - stone toddler			1
now newsreel archive @entity10 @entity9 has opened these vaults to the public , uploading all 85,000 of its films to @entity15 as a gift to the public			1
the firm was an iconic part of @entity10 life from 1896 to 1976 , when for some the dramatic black - and - white reports aired in cinemas would be their only source of news			2
general manager @entity26 described the films as a ' treasure trove ' and said : ' whether you ’re looking for coverage of the @entity31 , the @entity32 , the destruction of the @entity3 , or quirky stories about @entity10 pastimes , it ’ll be there on our channel			2
you can lose yourself for hours			0
' @entity39 has chosen 10 of the best videos from the vast collection - ranging from the horrors of the @entity43 to when one of @entity46 's busiest junctions was saved from gridlock by a huge flyover			1
the most bizarre , however , must be ' @entity49 ' , showing the underground bunker in south east @entity46 in which 28 - year - old @entity51 was kept prisoner for three months			1
the kidnapping was only discovered when a neighbour found a note hurled over the fence			0
seen around the world , images of the bomb which devastated a @entity61 city and ended the @entity57 still fascinated audiences two decades later			2
the documentary shows rare footage of bombs being made by the @entity67 before showing the mushroom - shaped blast and the devastation it wrought			1
unusually for newsreel commentaries - which are often more caustic than presenters would dare nowadays - a respectful silence is maintained over the footage of the explosion itself			1
battle and devastation dominated every second of newsreel during the @entity79 , as it was often the only way of those on the @entity81 seeing what happened overseas			0
the @entity9 archive includes huge numbers of videos from the conflicts , many of which were used to shore up support for the fighting at home			2
this clip includes soldiers scurrying around huge guns which were used to fire shells upon enemy lines from the trenches			0
the @entity99 airship was supposed to be a testament to the prowess of @entity102 's @entity101 , but famously crashed and exploded during a demonstration flight in @entity104 , killing 35			2
this video reveals the extent of the devastation , with the flaming wreckage of the airship falling to the ground even as would - be rescuers try to help those trapped inside			2
the solemn narrator describes it as ' an inferno which became a flaming tomb , a twisted mass of girders , the seared and scorched skeleton of what was once a mighty airship			0
' iconic in life , @entity121 enjoyed a little more privacy in death with crowds keeping at bay from a funeral organised by baseball star @entity128			0
her casket is carried out of a suburban church in @entity131 before being taken to a cemetery crypt for a deeply private service			0
the narrator tells audiences the ceremony had a ' dignity and simplicity denied to many @entity131 rites			0
' the enthusiastic narrator was hardly exaggerating when he declared : ' @entity141 on the greatest day the airport ever knew			2
' the day the @entity143 arrived back at @entity144 , now called @entity144 , in a plane named in their honour as fans massed on the roof has become one of the best - known incidences of @entity152			2
the narrator declares that ' even the seagulls in the nearby reservoir flew off in hysterics '			0
for some it may be hard to imagine the days when one @entity159 singer could bring the young and beautiful people of @entity46 's most swinging street to a standstill			1
but @entity163 does just that , waving to crowds of 8,000 in a packed @entity166 as balloons are released in celebration of his being named the best - dressed celebrity of the year			0
among @entity9 's last cinema newsreels , the full - colour video shows @entity163 arriving in a horse - drawn cart - though the hapless narrator does refer to ' the @entity175 '			1
the archive 's more bizarre offerings include this clip of three - year - old boy @entity179			1
seen with his parents in a sort of pen , @entity179 sits in an armchair to cheery funfair music before someone dangles a bar of chocolate over his head			0
the narrator dubiously claims the child is in good health and observes : ' nowadays he refuses to be weighed at all so we do n't really know whether he 's solid or hollow			0
' another odd clip sees @entity194 , a self - proclaimed ' human fish ' from @entity197 swimming lengths in a pool - with plates attached to his hands and feet			1
the claims made about him seem exaggerated , however , when he attempts what is claimed to be a miraculous leap out of the water			0
it may be the aged black - and - white footage , but it looks far more as though mr @entity194 simply turns over and dives to the bottom like any other swimmer			1
home to @entity46 's shopping @entity212 , it is one of the most heavily gridlocked junctions in the country			1
but the flow of traffic was once free and easy over @entity218 - after authorities built a bridge to allow the tube station to be excavated below			0
the temporary flyover was removed , however , just as everyone had got used to it - unveiling a ' grand a spacious ticket hall ready to cope with the ebb and flow of thousands of daily commuters ' in the ground below			1
the case of @entity232 's @entity231 shocked the world , but it was not the first of its kind			1
in an unassuming @entity239 villa in south east @entity46 , authorities found 28 - year - old @entity51 living in a secret underground room three months after she was captured			1
but miss @entity242 - rescued after a neighbour found a note hurled over the fence - was never raped by her captor			0
instead , a court heard labourer @entity249 forced her to help him extend the secret hole in the ground so he could use it to do his laundry .			0
