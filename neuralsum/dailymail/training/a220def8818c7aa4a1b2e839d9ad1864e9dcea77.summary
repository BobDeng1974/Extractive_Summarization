while many believed that this season 's title race was turning in to a procession for @entity7 's unbeaten @entity6 , @entity1 's recent resurgence has set up an enthralling fight to the finish			1
@entity6 's 3 - 0 victory over @entity11 meant the @entity12 maintained a six - point lead at the top of the table but free - scoring performances against @entity17 and @entity18 have seen @entity20 's @entity1 stake their intentions			1
@entity23 columnists @entity24 and @entity25 assess the merits of both sides battling to be crowned champions ... @entity6 stars celebrate during the 3 - 0 win against @entity11 , which saw their unbeaten run stretch to 21 games @entity20 ( left ) and @entity7 are involved in a two - way @entity34 title fight @entity1 's recent resurgence has seen the reigning champions close the gap to six points @entity38 on the defensive units @entity41 ’ mistakes are minimal and it never seems to be his fault when @entity6 concede — i ’m not sure you can say the same about @entity46			1
@entity47 and @entity48 are formidable and @entity50 and @entity51 solid			0
@entity52 is terrific but , @entity54 apart , the rest are inconsistent			0
but the key is the work done in front of them			0
@entity6 ’s pressing and the screen @entity60 provides means it ’s almost impossible to isolate their defenders			1
city on the other hand are too often left exposed			0
@entity65 7/10 @entity6 keeper @entity41 ( above ) is rarely at fault if @entity6 concede a goal , unlike @entity46 @entity1 concede an early goal by @entity69 during their 4 - 1 defeat of @entity18 @entity71 midfielder @entity60 ( left ) provides a defensive shield in front of @entity6 's back four @entity75 on the @entity76 when everybody is fit , there is very little to choose between these two midfields			1
@entity80 was a statement of intent and he has given @entity6 subtlety and class			2
they have lost @entity87 ’s goals but @entity80 ’ assists make up for it			0
@entity90 could get into any team in the world and @entity60 is a perfect shield			0
@entity1 have struggled to find that balance but injuries have disrupted them			0
people called @entity97 useless and unfit , but he scores a few and all of a sudden he ’s purring and @entity100 , when he ’s fit , is a genius			0
@entity6 9/10 city 9/10 city midfielder @entity97 is starting to find his form from last season at precisely the right time @entity106 has been an inspired signing and leads the way with 10 @entity34 assists this season @entity1 have missed the mercurial talents of @entity100 ( second right ) while he has been out injured @entity75 on the attacking power i said a few weeks ago the title race could be a shootout between @entity115 and @entity116			1
nothing has changed ! @entity116 has adapted so quickly and he plays on the edge , but i like that			2
@entity120 is useful as @entity7 ’s eyes in the dressing room and @entity123 provides good back - up			0
@entity115 is on fire and now he ’s staying fit his scoring rate is incredible			2
@entity127 is hit - and - miss and @entity128 has chipped in , but @entity115 has carried @entity1 at times			2
a front two of @entity116 and @entity115 would be the perfect partnership , but @entity115 ’s goals give @entity1 the slightest edge			1
@entity6 9/10 city 9.5/10 total : @entity6 26 city 25.5 @entity116 has given @entity6 the potent striker they have been searching for with 11 goals from 11 games a partnership between @entity116 ( left ) and @entity115 would be one of the most feared in world football @entity115 ( left ) has been making the difference for @entity1 and tops the scoring charts with 14 goals so far veteran striker @entity120 turned back the clock to score against @entity11 in midweek			1

@entity34 leaders @entity6 have gone 21 games unbeaten this term
reigning champions @entity1 are six points behind in title race
