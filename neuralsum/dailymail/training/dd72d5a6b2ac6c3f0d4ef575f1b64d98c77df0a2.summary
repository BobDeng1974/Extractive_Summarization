by @entity0 published : 20:48 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 27 may 2013 it 's a problem shared by married couples the world over			1
conflicting work schedules and the hectic pace of modern life can mean husband and wife quickly become little more than ships that pass in the night			2
but for the @entity12 's granddaughter @entity11 and her husband @entity13 it seems absence really is making the heart grow fonder			1
busy schedules : @entity11 and @entity13 enjoy some rare time together as she competes at the @entity17 last year she is an @entity18 horsewoman with a packed timetable on the three - day eventing circuit and he is a professional rugby player who captained the @entity22 in their defeat against @entity24 on the weekend			1
so with both busy training and competing around the world , they have n't been seeing much of one another lately			0
but when asked if being apart could actually be the secret of a successful marriage ms @entity29 answered a resounding yes			1
' exactly ' , she laughed : ' and we get to watch each other when we 're off - although i suppose it 's not very helpful if we want to go away together			2
' nuptials : the couple married at @entity39 in @entity40 in 2011 from the start , the marriage between ms @entity11 , currently the 14th in line to the throne , and the burly 16st mr @entity13 , was anything but a traditional @entity47 affair			1
they met in 2003 when mr @entity13 was in @entity49 for the @entity50			0
she happened to drop into the bar where he was drinking with friends			0
they struck up a conversation and soon became an item			0
mr @entity13 's alcohol - drenched stag do in @entity58 was the stuff of legend , resembling a @entity64 abroad - style reality tv show			2
he and his rugby - playing mates were pictured guzzling copious amounts of beer in a swimming pool and the party later racked up a bar bill of £ 12,000 – in the space of five hours			2
the couple share a tender moment during their @entity75 honeymoon their wedding , in july 2011 , was held not at @entity79 but at @entity80 in @entity40			1
she pledged to honour but not to obey and kept her maiden name			0
the reception , which was attended by the @entity12 , featured a vodka fountain and was said to involve some seriously hard - partying			0
@entity13 himself was only spotted returning to the bridal suite , still wearing his morning suit , at 2pm the following day			0
but their apparent relaxed attitude and obvious @entity88 has appeared to serve them well as husband and wife			0
horsewoman : @entity11 competes in the dressage event at the @entity95 where she narrowly missed out on a gold medal @entity13 in action for @entity24 during the @entity98 in @entity99 ' @entity13 and i are very lucky in that we 've got careers and we 've been able to follow our dreams , ' ms @entity29 told the @entity104			1
' i do n't really have any plans at the moment but in my sport you have to take it year by year			0
when you work with animals you ca n't plan too far ahead because something always goes wrong			0
' in january this year the couple sold their £ 1.2 million white stucco marital home in @entity116 in order to live on princess @entity120 's @entity119 estate near @entity121 , @entity122			2
the house , on the estate of the princess royal , already stables @entity11 's horses and is where she trains both racehorses and her three - day eventers			1
mr @entity13 is said to have developed a fondness for horses , and has even started riding			0
' he 's quite good , actually , ' ms @entity29 explains			2
' he has ridden , especially right at the beginning of our relationship , ' adding she believes this was partly because he was trying to impress her			2
support : ms @entity11 gets a hug from her husband after the equestrian show - jumping stage at the @entity95 mr @entity13 had the the last laugh when he was widely mocked for splashing out £ 12,000 and it went on to win the @entity142			1
despite buying their @entity116 home shortly after their wedding , in july 2011 , @entity11 has always kept the home she previously lived in on her mother 's estate			1
the couple 's first home was a cottage called @entity153 at @entity154 , and was given as a gift from the princess royal			1
to her credit ms @entity11 remains refreshingly down - to - earth , with a hands - on can - do attitude , something she believes she shares with other women in her family			1
' my grandmother 's like that , ' she adds			0
' and her mother before her , and my mum			0

@entity171 granddaughter married @entity24 rugby star in 2011
couple 's conflicting sporting schedule means they see little of one another
but ms @entity11 believes said it could be the secret of a successful marriage
