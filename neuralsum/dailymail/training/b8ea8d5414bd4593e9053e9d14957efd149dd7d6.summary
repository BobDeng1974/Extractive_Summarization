by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 man truly took the plunge when he proposed to his girlfriend as he popped the question after they had skydived from 15,000ft			0
@entity8 , 26 , had planned ahead to create the ultimate romantic scene			1
after convincing @entity10 , 29 , to join in him for a spectacular parachute jump , he arranged for her to land on a sun - kissed @entity14 beach where he was waiting down on one knee with a ring , flowers and a huge sign reading , " will you marry me ? " @entity8 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , had taken three months to plan the proposal after he and @entity10 had decided to go travelling			1
' a skydive seemed the most logical thing			0
it was then a question of finding a company who could accommodate my request and also at a location of pure natural beauty			0
' i always knew she would say yes and i was n't nervous about the skydive or proposal			2
' the coasteering instructor spent weeks scouting for locations before deciding upon @entity35 in @entity36 and getting outdoor adventures firm @entity57 on board with his plan			2
surprise ! as @entity10 landed on the beach after @entity8 , he popped the question sealed with a kiss : she said yes after getting @entity37 to join him for the skydive , he then had to ensure he leapt out first so he could be in position when she landed			1
@entity10 's tandem dive instructor gave @entity8 a few moments headstart before angling their 65 second descent so she came in to land right in front of his giant banner			1
she immediately said " yes " after @entity8 popped the question with a blue sapphire @entity79 engagement ring			2
@entity10 said the romantic moment completely took her by surprise			2
she said : ' i had absolutely no idea he was planning this			0
as we swooped round in the air to line up for our landing i could see the banner and when it clicked i could n't believe it			0
' i mean just an hour earlier @entity8 dropped the bombshell that we were going to do a skydive and then i 'm seeing a " will you marry me " banner			1
i just felt like i was dreaming and then reality kicked in and with it my emotions			0
more in store : the couple then moved onto a surprise engagement party @entity8 had arranged wedding bells : the globe - trotting pair will return to the @entity3 for a summer wedding in 2015 dream come true : @entity10 said she loved her romantic proposal ' @entity108 , my tandem buddy , swooped me down right in front of @entity8 and i could n't wait for him to disconnect me			1
' @entity8 then asked those famous words every girl dreams of hearing , " will you marry me " and with that i could n't hug him tight enough			2
' keen travellers , @entity8 and @entity10 met three years ago before heading to @entity118 and @entity36 for a two - year trip of a lifetime			1
they had been staying in @entity121 and working in a restaurant so @entity8 had even arranged for some of their friends to meet them after the proposal for a surprise engagement party at a venue near the beach			1
@entity8 said : ' the great thing about all of this is that @entity10 usually guesses when i 'm up to something , or planning anything and also has a terrible habit of guessing what it is also			1
' however on this occasion she did n't have a clue			0
which was key to the success , i wanted the whole day to be one surprise after another after another			0
' even down to the surprise engagement party i threw for her our friends at the end of the day			0
a feeling of pure elation and couple this with feeling like the luckiest guy on earth sums it up pretty good			0
' the couple plan to fly back to the @entity3 in october ahead of their august 2015 wedding .			1
