by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 one of the first signs that @entity4 is in full swing will be when an armed policeman appears on the steps outside the hospital			0
by that time @entity9 will be on her way and is expected to be taken into the @entity11 through one of three side entrances			1
meanwhile , obstetrician @entity14 will be alerted on his specially - encrypted mobile phone by the royal couple ’s private secretary , @entity16			0
the couple have yet to pick a name for the royal baby , and have opted not to find out the sex before the birth assuming he is at his @entity24 home at the time , mr @entity14 will grab his carefully prepared overnight bag and climb into his silver @entity28			1
the six - and - a - half - mile journey to the hospital should take no more than 20 minutes			0
but in case of heavy traffic , he can always put the green flashing light he is entitled to use as a doctor on call on the roof of his car			0
in the early stages of labour , @entity9 is likely to have her mother @entity41 at her side			1
but sources are now indicating that mrs @entity44 will not be present during the delivery , as has been suggested			1
the @entity46 of @entity47 where the first child of @entity49 and @entity9 is expected to be born the @entity51 wing boasts state - of - the - art clinical and emergency facilities in common with other patients , the @entity9 will give birth in one of the six delivery rooms on the @entity51 ’s third floor , which features ‘ soothing ’ block colour murals by @entity24 - based artist @entity60			1
courtiers have spoken of a ‘ range ’ of finely - tuned contingency plans , quietly confident that they have thought of everything			0
yet one rather important matter remains unresolved			0
the @entity66 can reveal that @entity67 and @entity9 have yet to choose a name for the future heir to the throne			2
the couple , who asked not to be told the gender , have drawn up a shortlist of boys and girls ’ names – but , like many modern couples , will only make a final decision after the baby is born .			2

the @entity49 and @entity9 do not yet have a name for the royal baby
have opted to decide once he or she is born later this month
despite previous suggestions , @entity44 will not be present at the birth of the baby
