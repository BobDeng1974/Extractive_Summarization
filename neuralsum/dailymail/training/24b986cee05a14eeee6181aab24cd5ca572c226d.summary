@entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on @entity2 in a @entity4 meeting by openly mocking the chancellor ’s claim that the @entity7 is outperforming other @entity9 economies			1
the @entity10 business secretary stunned last week ’s @entity4 by highlighting mr @entity2 ’s repeated boast that the @entity7 government could borrow money more cheaply than other @entity9 countries – because he claims that the markets back his austerity regime			1
cuttingly , mr @entity0 said he ‘ could n’t help noticing ’ that figures suggested the @entity7 was actually ‘ on a par ’ with the much - maligned socialist - style @entity19 and @entity20 economies , which mr @entity2 has derided for being debt - laden and uncompetitive			1
@entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on @entity2 in a @entity4 meeting by openly mocking the chancellor ’s claim that the @entity7 is outperforming other @entity9 economies one source claimed : ‘ @entity27 spoke , @entity2 looked stormy			1
there was just the sound of indignant muttering from the conservatives in the room			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s remarks will heighten tensions within the @entity35 – already at breaking point with little more than three months to go until the @entity37			0
they will also increase suspicions the business secretary is trying to align himself closer to labour ahead of potential talks on a @entity43 @entity42 , which could see the 71 - year - old former @entity45 member finally achieve his ambition to become chancellor			0
when mr @entity2 appeared at the @entity48 in @entity49 last month , he urged eurozone countries to copy his policy of slashing public spending and cited @entity19 and @entity20 as being in particular need of ‘ structural reform ’			2
the chancellor has repeatedly said in his @entity57 speeches that because of the strength of the @entity7 economy he has been able to borrow money more cheaply than most of our @entity9 competitors : the highest rates – known as bond yields – are charged by the @entity65 to countries with the greatest chance of going bust			2
but at the @entity4 meeting , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i ca n’t help noticing that the bond yields of @entity19 and @entity20 are now on a par with ours			1
’ however , sources close to mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ there was an exchange , but in it @entity0 agreed with @entity2 that the eurozone economies still pose a destabilising risk to the @entity7 economy			2
in fact , it is one of the few things @entity2 and @entity0 do agree about			0
’ @entity2 ( pictured with @entity0 and @entity81 ) is said to have ' looked stormy ' when @entity0 made the remarks mr @entity2 has repeatedly argued that low @entity7 bond yields represent a pat on the back from investors for his spending cuts			1
last week , the yield on ten - year bonds was 1.3 per cent for the @entity7 , compared with 1.5 per cent for @entity20 and just 0.5 per cent for @entity19			2
last night , a senior @entity91 source said that mr @entity0 had irritated @entity91 ministers in recent months by using meetings to praise the performance of the @entity19 economy under president @entity96			0
like @entity97 , @entity96 has criticised ‘ the economics of austerity ’ , as practised by mr @entity2 , arguing that @entity9 needs a ‘ different way forward ’ to deal with the debt crisis			0
mr @entity0 declined to comment last night .			0
