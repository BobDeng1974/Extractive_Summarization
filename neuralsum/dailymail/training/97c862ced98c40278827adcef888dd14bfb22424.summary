by @entity0 published : 22:58 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 23:38 est , 5 december 2012 a statue of an ' angel of hope ' was erected in the @entity5 cemetery just feet from where @entity6 and @entity7 were buried after their father killed them - and himself - in a house explosion in february			1
a crime - fighting group used the donations they collected in the wake of the horrific double murder - suicide of the two young boys paid for the statue to be commissioned			2
the @entity7 family saga , however , drags on with little reason for hope as @entity6 and @entity7 's grandparents still look for any clues relating to the disappearance of the boy 's mother @entity25			1
reflecting : @entity27 , the boy 's grandfather , pauses and looks at the statue erected in @entity6 and @entity7 's honor nearly nine months after they were killed by their father tragic : @entity33 ( right ) disappeared in 2009 and her estranged husband @entity34 ( top ) killed himself and their two sons @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 ( center ) in a house explosion @entity40 was the main suspect in @entity25 's 2009 disappearance , since he told police that on that fateful night he decided to take the young boys on an impromptu camping trip in the dead of winter in a @entity47 desert			1
his siblings have stayed in touch with @entity25 's parents , @entity51 and @entity52			2
' it is only a 15 minute drive from their home and right up on the hill above @entity6 and @entity7 's plot and the plot where @entity25 will be buried when we find her , ' @entity53 , @entity34 's brother - in - law , told @entity62			1
the monument at @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity5 near the @entity27 home was funded by @entity67 and they dedicated it as a place of ' healing ' for anyone who has lost a child in their lives			2
common use : the memorial , funded for by donations to @entity67 , was dedicated to all people who have lost children in their lives up the hill : the memorial was placed not far from the plot where the two boys are buried , and where @entity33 will be buried if her body is ever found as the family begins to go through their first holiday season without the two boys , they are also faced with another absence as the third anniversary of @entity25 's disappearance is thursday			2
' i have to hope that @entity34 told somebody something before he killed himself			0
it is hard to get really hopeful but at the same time there is a possibility that he spoke to his dad , ' @entity53 said			0
@entity34 's dad , @entity97 , is the one link that remains as @entity34 lived with @entity97 for months between the time of @entity25 's disappearance and the day when @entity34 hacked his children to death during a court - ordered supervised visit before setting the house on fire with a gas explosion			1
@entity97 is in his own set of legal problems , however , as he has been arrested for two and a half years in jail for two counts of voyeurism			0
tragedy : @entity7 blew up his @entity5 home , pictured , killing himself and the two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit happier times : @entity33 's parents , @entity51 and @entity52 , were living with her sons @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) at the time of the horrific incident waiting for clues : @entity122 , @entity34 's father , may know information about @entity25 's disappearance , but he refuses to talk and is in jail on different voyeurism charges during his trial , he revealed that he had a sexual infatuation with @entity25 and had pictured her secretly at points over the years of his son 's marriage			1
even an impending jail sentence did n't sway @entity97 to reveal details about the whereabouts of her body - if he knows any			0
' he wo n't talk to anyone right now , he wo n't respond to people who have put in an effort			0
i have a very low opinion of him and have for 16 years			0
i feel that if it serves his purpose he will talk but unless he gets something out if it then he has no reason to say anything , ' @entity53 told @entity62 .			0

@entity40 killed himself and his two sons @entity6 and @entity7 in a home explosion in february during a court - ordered visit
he was also the main suspect in the disappearance of their mother @entity25
donations funded a memorial in the boys ' honor
