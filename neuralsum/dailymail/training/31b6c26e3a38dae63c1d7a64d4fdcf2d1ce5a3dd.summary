by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 5 september 2013 air pollution created by the @entity3 could be responsible for the retreat of glaciers in the @entity6 , scientists claim			1
@entity8 researchers believe the reason for the end of the ' @entity11 ' in around 1850 could be down to the large amounts of soot being spewed out by @entity15 's growing factories and steam engines			2
this activity could explain why glaciers in the @entity6 began to melt and retreat before the accepted beginning of ' global warming , ' they said			1
soot from glaciers on the @entity22 in the @entity6 ( pictured ) explain why glaciers began to retreat in the mid-nineteenth century , according to @entity8 scientists			1
they reason that darker surfaces absorb more heat , so if enough soot fell onto snow and ice it would have accelerated melting there are around 4,000 @entity6 glaciers of various sizes that are currently under threat from warming temperatures			1
during the @entity11 , which stretched from the beginning of the 14th century to around 1850 , glaciers thrived in the cool climate and in the mid 19th @entity42 were almost twice as large as they are now , @entity38 reported			0
as @entity15 became increasingly industrialised the @entity6 glaciers suddenly began to retreat but interestingly , average global temperatures did not rise noticeably until the end of the century , causing scientists to look for an explanation why			1
alpine climate records , which are considered to be some of the most reliable in the world , suggest that the bodies of ice should have continued to thrive until around 1910 , according to @entity54 research that was published in journal proceedings of the @entity57 of @entity58			0
@entity59 from the university , said : ' something gnawed on the glaciers that climate records do n’t capture			0
' @entity8 researchers believe the reason for the end of the ' @entity11 ' in around 1850 could be down to the large amounts of soot being spewed out by @entity15 's factories and steam engines that settled on glaciers a sharp drop in the amount of snowfall during winter has previously been blamed for the decline of the glaciers , but the scientist thinks soot is the reason			2
he decided to investigate whether soot particles from the burning of coal could explain the decline of the glaciers , after discussing the mystery with @entity84 , a snow hydrologist at @entity86 ’s @entity85 in @entity87 two years ago			2
professor @entity59 believes that if soot fell onto the snow and ice of the glaciers , it would have caused them to melt faster as darker surfaces absorb more heat			1
his theory is strengthened by historical records that say the air in some @entity6 valleys was polluted in the mid 19th century and ' housewives in @entity101 refrained from drying laundry outdoors ' presumably because soot would dirty the clothes			0
scientists had ruled out a prevalence of soot in the area as a reason for hastening melting glaciers as they thought it would not have been carried high enough to reach the glaciers in large enough quantities			2
dr @entity59 's industrial theory is strengthened by historical records that say the air in some @entity6 valleys was polluted in the mid 19th century and ' housewives in @entity101 ( pictured ) refrained from drying laundry outdoors ' presumably because soot would dirty the clothes however , professor @entity121 's team found that in 1860 layers of glacial ice contained large amounts of soot when they looked at ice cores from the @entity128 glacier at 4,455 metres above sea level the @entity130 at 3,900 metres in the @entity131			1
they calculated the effect the soot would have had on the glaciers using a simplified mass - balance model , to discover the effect of soot explained the glacier retreat			0
@entity140 , a glaciologist at the @entity141 who was not involved in the study , told nature the modelling could not be more refined and the ' study offers a very elegant and plausible explanation for the glacier conundrum			0
it appears that in central @entity15 soot prematurely stopped the @entity11			0
' professor @entity59 said global warming only became the primary reason for the retreat of glaciers after 1970 when air quality began to improve			1
he warned that if the glaciers continue to melt at the same rate as the past 30 years , they could disappear by the close of the century .			0

@entity8 scientists believe industrial activity could explain why @entity6 glaciers began to melt before the accepted beginning of global warming
@entity54 researchers studied ice cores taken from glaciers high in the @entity6 to dind *surprisingly* large quantities of soot in the *samples*
professor @entity59 believes if soot fell onto the snow and ice of the glaciers , it would have caused them to melt faster as darker surfaces absorb heat
