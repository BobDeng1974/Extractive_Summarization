by @entity0 a newly - released tape has revealed the incredible moment a pilot realised @entity6 stowaway @entity4 had been hiding on his plane			1
the tape runs from about an hour after the 15 - year - old was discovered on a @entity10 runway in april			1
incredibly , the pilot seems completely nonplussed			1
he is preparing to depart when he tells air traffic controllers he will be a bit delayed because ' a guy is seeming to have stowed away in the landing gear from @entity16 to @entity17			1
he then claimed to have hopped a fence at @entity29 and climbed into the wheel well of the closest plane			0
the jet took off a few hours later for a five - and - a - half - hour flight to @entity17 on april 20			1
@entity4 improbably survived the flight at 35,000 feet despite low oxygen and freezing temperatures			1
video footage from the @entity17 airport shows him dropping to the tarmac about an hour after the jet landed			1
but when it was time for that same jet to leave , the pilot , who was a different pilot than the one who had landed the jet there , said security and mechanics were holding him up , according to a 10 - minute @entity50 audio recording			1
' um , we have a little gate delay here			0
a guy is seeming to have stowed away in the landing gear from @entity16 to @entity17 , so we have security in there looking for evidence of the guy being up there for more than , you know , ha , five minutes on the ground			0
captured on camera : @entity10 transportation officials have released video of a @entity22 teen hopping from a jet 's wheel ( pictured ) well after stowing away for a 5 1/2 - hour flight to @entity17 ' so we 'll let you know when we 're ready to push , ' says the pilot of outbound @entity71 24 , heading for @entity72			1
' all right , 24 , have your roger , ' says an air traffic controller , confirming he received and understood the message			0
' you need any assistance with that or , er , you guys got it ? ' ' nope , plenty of security here , mechanics , it 's all good , we just kind of waiting for clearance to go , ' says the pilot , explaining that once the crews agree the plane is undamaged , they 'll give him the go - ahead			1
the controller is calm , routine , in his response , telling the pilot he can back away from the ramp when he 's ready , because the tower does n't have jurisdiction over that part of the airport : ' @entity102 , thanks , well it will be push back at your discretion			2
' incredible : @entity4 ( pictured left and right ) miraculously survived a more than five hour flight from @entity22 to @entity10 hidden in a plane 's wheel well pilot : ' um , we have a little gate delay here			1

' pilot : ' @entity141 , thanks			2
' hiding place : @entity4 climbed into the plane wheel well of @entity71 jet ( pictured ) and lost consciousness after the plane took off ' @entity141 , thanks , ' says the pilot			1

a county spokesman said yesterday he can not disclose the boy 's whereabouts			0
his father did not respond to an interview request			0
@entity71 spokeswoman @entity158 said the crew of the departing flight had been told about the stowaway and the activity going on around their aircraft			2
she said the pilot contacted the controller because once an aircraft has received the en route clearance , there is an expectation from the air traffic control tower that the aircraft is prepared to depart and will push back shortly			2
' in this instance , the pilot was advising @entity175 of the delay and providing an explanation to the best of his knowledge , ' said @entity158			2
the @entity50 planned to provide a public link to the audio today			0

tape runs from that about an hour after @entity4 was discovered
the pilot appears nonplussed as he tells controllers he will be a bit delayed
@entity4 had improbably survived the flight at 35,000ft despite low oxygen
