by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 12 august 2012 updated : 05:48 est , 14 august 2012 @entity1 has been criticized for being unemotional in the past , but that seems to be behind him as he joined running mate @entity3 in welling up with tears during a campaign event in @entity3 's home state of @entity7 on sunday			1
' @entity8 filled my eyes , tears filled @entity13 ’s eyes			0
i ’m not sure about the kids , but the rest of us felt very emotional , ' @entity1 said after the event in @entity18 , @entity7			2
the rally was held the day after @entity3 was announced as @entity1 's vice presidential pick			1
@entity3 , the 42 - year - old congressman who still lives in his hometown of @entity22 , was undoubtedly the most moved by the strong show of support			2
' hi , @entity25 ! ' were his first words			0
' i like to hunt here , i like to fish here , to snowmobile here			0
i even think ice fishing is interesting			0
' i see my family over there — that ’s half the stadium			0
i have lots of family			0
' the crowd seemed just as thrilled as @entity3 was , and were more than happy to bring that familial headcount up			2
' we are all brothers , ' one fan shouted			0
keeping right up with the joke , @entity3 replied : ' you 're right , we are all brothers			2
that was n't my brother who said that , actually			0
' bonding already : since the announcement of @entity3 on the ticket , @entity1 has seemed energetic quite a crowd : @entity3 has announced that he will be running for re-election for his congressional seat at the same time as the presidential election because his name is already on the ballot the @entity18 event which had an estimated 10,000 people in attendance took place the same day as @entity1 and @entity3 appeared in their first sit - down interview since they announced their partnership			1
@entity3 made his name in @entity87 circles due to the major cuts he has suggested for the national budget and proposed @entity91 overhauls			1
while @entity1 praised @entity3 's attempt to ' save @entity91 ' and called the diligence that @entity3 has shown towards budget cuts - which @entity1 called ' very much needed ' - @entity1 never actually committed to either			1
@entity3 showed that he was in step with @entity1 when it comes to the question of tax returns as he said he will only release two years of tax returns - the same amount that @entity1 has come under fire for releasing			1
the pair appeared relaxed and notably open - collared during their interview with @entity106 's @entity105			2
when asked how many years of returns he had to present to the @entity1 camp during their months of secretive talks leading up to his appointment as the vice presidential candidate , @entity3 shied away from a clear answer			1
happy together : @entity3 and @entity1 appeared in their first joint interview which aired on @entity106 on sunday night , the day after @entity3 was publicly added to the ticket ‘ it was a very exhaustive vetting process , ’ @entity3 said in the interview , adding that it was confidential and therefore he would not be releasing the exact number of years he had to give to the campaign before getting their stamp of approval			1
‘ i ’m going to be releasing two years , ’ @entity3 confirmed			1
though he put the kibosh on the tax releases , that was not the self - proclaimed policy wonk ’s last soundbite on their vision for tax policy			0
only a portion of the interview was aired on 60 minutes on sunday			0
kiss for good luck : @entity3 gets a kiss from his wife @entity140 during a campaign event in his home state of @entity7 on sunday , the day after his addition to the ticket was announced policy wonks : @entity1 praised @entity3 's analytical focus and said that they both enjoyed drafting policy both @entity1 and @entity3 talked about how their vision is one that differs greatly from the picture that president @entity152 ’s campaign has painted , of how they reportedly plan to give tax breaks to the wealthiest @entity155 while forgetting about the less wealthy			1
@entity3 , who at 42 - years - old is the same age as one of @entity1 's son 's , has been yet to be seen wearing a tie since he hit the campaign trail formally on saturday			1
65 , has followed suit , taking off his tie in subsequent appearances and analysts have viewed the move as an effort to seem more relaxed and comfortable with his younger partner			0
in recent months , @entity1 has been ditching the necktie more often as he has gained ground and become more comfortable campaigning since he was announced as the presumptive @entity87 nominee			1
@entity3 said that they plan to ‘ take away the tax shelters that are uniquely enjoyed by people in the top tax brackets			1
’ some political analysts immediately pointed as potentially pointed as it is thought that @entity1 ’s reluctance to release more years or tax filings comes because he may have used such havens to his advantage			1
@entity3 and @entity1 appeared at ease with one another during the taped interview that aired on @entity106 sunday night and it gave the two men a chance to explain how they envision their relationship should they win come november			1
highlighting @entity3 ’s policy experience that comes as a result of his 14 years in @entity190 , @entity3 said that they would be sure to capitalize on said knowledge if they win the election			1
‘ i anticipate that there will be certain areas that he will take a lead role , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ he would also have a role in helping shepherd legislation on the @entity200			0
i ca n’t imagine not using him and to have his skill ’ when dealing with @entity190			0
a complete suit : internet commentators noted that , during their announcement on saturday , @entity3 wore a jacked with no tie while @entity1 wore a tie but no jacket insider : @entity1 praised @entity3 's prowess in @entity210 , saying that ' there are people that may disagree with @entity3 , but i do n't know of anyone that does n't respect his character and judgement ' ‘ he has that almost unique capacity to find people of different parties to come together			1
’ president @entity152 released a statement on the selection of @entity3 for the ticket that shows that @entity225 will likely attempt to portray the @entity7 congressman as a far - right conservative			2
' he is a decent man , he is a family man , he is an articulate spokesman for governor @entity1 's vision but it is a vision that i fundamentally disagree with , ' he said in the statement			2
while his congressional record will clearly be scoured over the coming weeks and months , what may become an issue for @entity3 is the public perception of @entity190 in general			2
though it has come down from its all - time high of 84 per cent disapproval rating , @entity190 still faces 76.2 per cent disapproval in the latest polls			0
campaign : @entity155 @entity87 presidential candidate and former @entity244 governor @entity1 ( r ) and @entity245 hopeful @entity7 representative @entity3 ( @entity246 ) speak with media aboard a charter airplane from @entity249 , @entity250 to @entity251 , @entity252 , on august 11 , 2012 happy : @entity87 vice presidential candidate @entity3 ( @entity254 ) campaigns with @entity87 presidential candidate @entity1 on august 11 , 2012 in @entity255 , @entity250 ‘ it ’s the worst i ’ve seen since i 've been in @entity190 in the past 14 years , ’ @entity3 agreed , though he placed the blame on president @entity152 saying that @entity190 is ‘ dysfunctional ’ because of a lack of leadership from above			1
‘ president @entity152 is picking winners and losers based on personal connections , ’ @entity3 said			2
‘ what i see is a new amount of crony capitalism			0
’ the latest national polls still have president @entity152 at 4.6 per cent ahead of the @entity267 ticket			0
the pair appears to be on a charm offensive as the younger @entity3 - who , at 42 - years - old is the same age as one of @entity1 's son 's - seems to have helped bring out the softer side of the @entity87 presidential nominee			1
and according to his wife , that has a lot to do with his easy - going disposition			0
' you know , he 's pretty low - maintenance			0
@entity3 is someone who goes with the flow and has one of the sunniest demeanors and most positive outlooks of anyone i 've ever met			0
so i 'd say @entity1 'll probably have a lot of fun with him , ' @entity140 told @entity289			0

@entity1 and @entity3 have first interview since @entity293 pick announced
@entity3 would n't reveal how many years of tax returns he had to give the @entity1 campaign during the vetting process but said it was ' exhaustive '
@entity1 praised @entity3 's work to ' save @entity91 ' and the *drastic* budget cuts that are ' very much needed ' but did n't commit to the plans
