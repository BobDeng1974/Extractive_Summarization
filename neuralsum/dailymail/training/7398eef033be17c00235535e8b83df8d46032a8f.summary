by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 10:15 est , 12 january 2014 a @entity3 teenager has died after smoking a synthetic drug known as @entity5 - and now his family are fighting to raise awareness of the dangerous concoction and have authorities acknowledge it caused his and many other deaths			1
@entity12 , 18 , moved to @entity13 , @entity14 to live with his aunt , @entity15 , and work at her family 's commercial glass shop after graduating high school			1
but what was supposed to be a promising new start ended abruptly , when @entity15 found him dead inside his room with a pipe filled with @entity5 and a lighter on the floor by his side			1
however , the state medical examiner and @entity27 wo n't acknowledge @entity5 caused the november 16 death of the otherwise healthy teen and have ruled it a mystery			1
but the fresh start turned to tragedy ' whatever hit him , ( it ) hit him hard and hit him fast , ' @entity15 told @entity42			1
' the pipe was right there by his feet			0
he was a healthy kid			0
the lighter was right there			0
the pipe was right there			0
he never had any kind of heart problems or seizures			0
' some of the partially burned ' @entity5 ' was still in the pipe , but its chemical composition was n't tested , the family say			1
spice , gaining popularity as a legal alternative to marijuana , is actually a mystery cocktail of chemicals made in @entity64 and shipped to the @entity65 where it is sprayed on plant material and packaged as incense or potpourri			2
it generally comes with a warning , ' not for human consumption , ' however it is clearly positioned as a tool for getting high			0
@entity15 and the teen 's mother , @entity74 , are certain @entity5 killed @entity12 , a happy - go - lucky teen			1
but the @entity77 has listed his death as ' undetermined , ' as in many other suspected cases , because an autopsy of @entity12 's body did not turn up any medical conditions			1
dangerous : some of the partially burned ' @entity5 , ' pictured , was still in the pipe , but its chemical composition was n't tested , the family say ( file photo ) popular : @entity5 , pictured , is gaining popularity as a legal alternative to marijuana , is actually a mystery cocktail of chemicals made in @entity64 and shipped to the @entity65 where it is sprayed on plant material and packaged as incense or potpourri a toxicity screening of his blood , bile and other body fluids did not show any signs of illegal drugs or alcohol , despite some 300 drugs being tested for , including outlawed combinations of @entity5			1
but @entity105 , founder of to the @entity106 , a nonprofit anti-synthetic drug foundation , said the chemists change their formulas often , trying to dodge laws aimed at their product			0
in @entity14 , packages of synthetic drugs have not tested positive for banned substances in months			1
' it 's not a marijuana alternative , and these newer chemicals have never been seen on earth before -- the kids are the lab rats , ' @entity105 said			0
but @entity12 's family are determined that his death will not go unsolved , medically			1
they 've teamed up with @entity105 , whose own son @entity124 was killed in june 2011 after he smoked synthetic marijuana then ran his car into a house			2
synthetic drugs are still largely mysterious			0
the number of people killed by the cocktails each year is relatively unknown because most @entity5 - related deaths are listed as undetermined or as a result of something else			2
horror : his aunt , @entity15 , pictured , found him dead inside his room with a pipe filled with @entity5 and a lighter on the floor by his side determined : @entity12 's family are determined that his death will not go unsolved , medically in september , @entity142 officials began investigating three possible @entity5 - related deaths			1
but there are hundreds of stories of both suspected and officially designated @entity5 - related deaths online			2
' currently only 22 of several hundred synthetic cannabinoids can be identified in blood fluids			0
they are actually looking for metabolites in blood , and it is a difficult and slow process to identify these chemicals , ' @entity105 told @entity42			0
in @entity12 's case , the drugs themselves were not tested to determine their composition			2
testing for the exact chemical composition in synthetic drugs can be tricky but it 's not impossible			2
while synthetic drugs are metabolized by the body , they can be identified in the drug itself , which is the test @entity105 and @entity12 's family want carried out			1
@entity74 said the troopers told her they could not submit the drugs to the lab because there appeared to be no criminal intent in @entity12 's death			1
the mother is hiring a private attorney to get the drugs to the lab for testing			0
' i know @entity5 killed my son , ' @entity74 told the news website			1
meanwhile , the @entity181 of @entity182 wants to get the drugs off the shelves , and is considering a new law that will outlaw possession and sale of @entity5 , not because of the chemical makeup but because of deceptive marketing			2
the drugs are sold in @entity14 at local smoke and head shops , usually packaged with a cartoonish character and a name such as ' @entity195 ' and ' mr. @entity196			0
' ' they market this crap to 12 - year - olds			0
it has @entity201 on the front of it , smiley faces , @entity205 -- i mean , that 's who its being marketed to			0
it 's horrible , ' @entity15 said .			0

@entity12 , 18 , was found dead in the *bedroom* of his aunt 's @entity13 , @entity14 home
he had moved to @entity14 from @entity3 for a fresh start after graduating high school
his family are convinced @entity5 killed him and are rallying to raise awareness of the dangerous synthetic cocktail available on store shelves and to have authorities acknowledge it caused his death and others
currently , the state medical examiner and @entity27 troopers have ruled the november 16 death of the otherwise healthy teen a mystery
