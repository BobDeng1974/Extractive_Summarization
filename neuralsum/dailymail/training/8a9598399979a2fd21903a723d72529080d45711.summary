by @entity0 published : 21:42 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 08:36 est , 23 november 2013 shocking footage has emerged of the horrific abuse of pigs at a farm that until recently provided pork to the largest meat producer in the @entity7			1
the appalling video was shot at @entity9 between september and october by an activist with @entity11 and shows pigs being punched , kicked , smashed into concrete and locked in cages so small they ca n’t even move			1
@entity9 , in @entity15 , supplied meat for @entity17 , according to @entity11			1
@entity17 severed all ties after the video was made public			1
‘ we are immediately terminating our contract with this farmer and will take possession of the animals remaining on the farm , ’ he added			1
farm owner @entity40 reportedly fired all employees involved in the video , but their faces were often obscured from sight			1
the disturbing footage begins with a montage of animals being hit with wooden boards , kicked , beaten and lying in pools of blood or locked in cages			1
the deplorable physical abuse did n’t just stop at kicking and punching the defenseless pigs			1
piglets also endured being violently shaken , thrown through the air only to be spiked on to the concrete floor like footballs or even held by the tail and swung repeatedly into the floor			2
no anesthesia provided : piglets have their tails cut and testicles removed without the benefit of any medication to dull the pain appaling : this worker sits on the pig , repeatedly punching it no big deal : a former hog farm worker commented on @entity71 that the pigs do n't even feel the punches despicable : this piglet is kicked by an out - of - control farmhand over the top : it is not uncommon for animals to be hit , the former farmhand said , but it usually never approaches this level of violence a walkway is shown with several bloody piglets on the ground having seizures or writhing in agony , blood is splattered everywhere			2
multiple piglets have their tails removed either with a shovel swung violently down on the tail , severing it , or with a pair of shears – no painkillers are administered			2
another unfortunate piglet is also shown being held by their hind legs and having their testicles removed , again without painkillers or anesthesia			0
the suffering causes it to let out a loud squeal and violently shake			0
a pregnant pig too fat to move is kicked , punched and has clumps of hair ripped out			0
horrifying : this pig is still alive , but has begun to rot after being tossed on a pile of other dead pigs write caption here this is not right : piglets writhe in agony after being slammed onto the concrete floor , some have seizures not uncommon , but being done wrong : ill or infirm piglets are often slammed into the ground to instantly kill them , according to a former pig farm employee one pig had a bowling ball thrown at its head , other had their eyes gouged out or their ears violently pulled			2
pigs barely clinging to life are tossed in piles of dead pigs , they start to rot even though they are still living			0
a @entity71 user who once worked on a hog farm commenting that the abuse shown in the video is far from uncommon , but that this farm took it too far			1
‘ piglets are killed by having their heads smashed against the concrete because it ’s quick and if done properly ( which those guys are n’t doing ) the piglets are dead before they even know what happened , ’ said legless_kraig			0
close quarters : pregnant pigs are kept in tightly - packed pens that provide no room to move waiting to die : the miserable pigs have nothing to live for , they are stripped of their dignity several times a day dead inside : the sad images show pigs suffering from depression , malnourishment and a host of other issues ‘ pulling by the ears to get them to move somewhere specific was common and kicking in the back end was too but realistically the pigs feel nothing from the kicking , ’ he continued			0
‘ gouging of the eyes was something that was done to the adult pigs when they were n't moving down the aisles or being stubborn and hard to handle , ’ the @entity170 further explained			0
they are mistreated , malnourished and then sent to slaughter – if they endure the torture long enough to be that lucky			0
most of the employees are miserable too , @entity180 wrote			0
‘ it was n't a job i felt proud of doing but i was young and needed a way to get money … that last year was a struggle every day to just drive to work			0

the abuse occurred at @entity9 between september and october
@entity17 contracted the farm to supply pork
that contract was terminated when the footage was made public
