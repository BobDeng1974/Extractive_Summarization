by @entity0 it ’s probably not the way i would have wanted to be introduced to @entity4 – in a packed , noisy club and wearing a bright blue latex gimp mask			1
i should quickly explain at this point that this was n’t one of @entity12 ’s specialist underground s&m parties - it was @entity15 fancy dress bash that i ’d been invited to and had decided to go as @entity16			2
@entity4 turned up as @entity17 looking so hot ( right now ) wearing a skin tight black @entity19 cat - suit , with her blonde hair swept back tight under pvc cat ears			2
@entity0 joined a host of celebrities at @entity4 and @entity26 's superhero party dressed as @entity16 the party was at hip new @entity12 club @entity28			1
the place was packed out and everyone in the room went crazy when she arrived			0
@entity4 turned up with a good friend of mine @entity26 and joined us at the back of the vip room with her entourage dancing on the chairs			1
i had been wearing the mask for so long i kind of forgot it was still on when we were introduced			0
i ’m sure i must have made a really good first impression wearing a mask with a big letter a emblazoned on the front			0
@entity4 dazzled @entity0 in a @entity46 costume where as @entity26 seemed to have forgotten the party 's theme @entity4 's stylist , @entity50 , also came as cat woman and club owner , @entity53 , as @entity54 i do n’t quite have the physique of the @entity16 actor @entity56 at the moment so i chose not to have the full skin - tight body suit - but i ’m getting back in great shape again with help of some intensive work outs and some @entity63 supplements , so it ’s only a matter of time			1
it was about 2am when 10 bottles of @entity70 champagne were sent over by our generous host - legendary @entity12 club owner @entity53 - and the party kicked up yet another gear			0
@entity0 with @entity53 's girlfriend , @entity76 @entity0 said he could n't recognise @entity78 's superhero outfit , but says she was certainly a supermodel @entity53 came as @entity54 and he ’s pictured next to @entity4 ’s stylist @entity50 - who also came as @entity17			1
you can see me in the pictures dancing on the seats with @entity82 ’s stunning blonde model / actress girlfriend @entity83			0
she had made her own costume - i ca n’t remember which super hero it was but she was certainly a supermodel			0
@entity0 partied till the early hours and was left with a superhero sized hangover the @entity90 flyer from that night @entity91 was also at the party - dressed as @entity93 and presumably he could put the price of the costume down on his expenses			1
@entity4 left about 3am via the back entrance of the club but the party carried on very late and i had a superhero sized hangover the next day			2
lots of love , @entity0			0

@entity0 attended @entity26 and @entity4 's superheroes bash

he said his body was n't in the right shape for the whole body suit
