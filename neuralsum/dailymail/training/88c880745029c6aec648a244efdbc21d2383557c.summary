former federal mps have threatened the government with @entity3 action should they lose their free airfare travel pass			1
the retired mps have submitted a report to the @entity7 blasting the government 's ' unconstitutional ' plans to abolish the ' life gold pass ' travel card			1
the government announced in may that it would eradicate the travel perk , which allows retired @entity5 and their spouses to take up to ten , free , return business - class airfares within @entity15 every year			1
however in a new report , former @entity17 mp @entity16 , who is also president of the @entity18 of the @entity19 , said that the proposal was ' unacceptable ' , ' disappointing ' and ' should not be arbitrated by public opinion			1
he said current pass holders will eventually stop travelling because of age or death and given the closure of the pass to parliamentarians elected after 2012 , the abolition of the benefit is not justified			0
members of @entity19 need to serve seven terms , or 20 years in @entity19 , to qualify for a travel pass			0
retired mps have submitted a report to the @entity7 blasting the government 's ' unconstitutional ' plans to abolish the ' life gold pass ' travel card			1
mps and senators elected since 2012 are not eligible for the pass			0
mr @entity16 argues in the report that the only justification given for the obliteration of the pass was that retired mps must be forced ' to make a contribution to the budget repair task '			2
he states that the travel pass was given to parliamentarians as part of their remuneration package and backtracking on the government 's part was ' irresponsible '			2
mr @entity16 says according to public opinion , ' whatever remuneration parliamentarians receive is too much , regardless of how low it may be '			0
the current pass allows retired @entity5 and their spouses to take up to ten free return airfares within @entity15 every year he also claims that ' parliamentarians ' entitlements should not be the subject of political whim or expediency			1
' the gold pass extends to spouses accompanying mps on official trips			2
mr @entity27 alleges that most spouses during his era gave up their chances at a career , claiming therefore that ' the electorate was served by two for the price of one			0
' ' this appropriately recognises that during the era that most @entity88 holders served in the @entity19 their spouses , rather than pursuing their own careers , voluntarily and without remuneration supported the parliamentarian in their day - to - day electorate work , including attending functions in the electorate , ' ms @entity27 said			0
mr @entity16 said the scheme - which was held for mps elected to parliament before 2012 - was served to parliamentarians ' in lieu of inadequate salaries ' and justifications for its removal were ' fanciful			0
' he also stated that the government ' are on very shaky ground regarding the constitutional validity of the legislation ' and obliterating it would be ' unconstitutional ' because it amounts to ' unjust ' acquisition of property			0
the report , which has been submitted to a @entity7 enquiry , has now been removed from the @entity19 's website following an article which appeared on @entity115 .			1
