a @entity1 student says she was forced to personally prosecute the man she claims sexually assaulted her			1
now @entity3 , 22 , is suing the school as well as her alleged attacker for @entity7 violations , which prevent discrimination of gender at federally funded schools			1
@entity1 is part of the @entity12			2
filed last month in @entity15 federal court , @entity3 ' suit seeks monetary damages and a court order dissolving the school 's practice of requiring sexual assault victims to ' prosecute their won cases and to cross-examine and be cross-examined by their assailants			1
' @entity3 , 22 , is suing @entity1 as well as her alleged attacker for @entity7 violations , which prevent discrimination of gender at federally funded schools which , as @entity25 reports , is exactly what she @entity3 says happened to her			1
@entity3 says the attack happened early on january 26 , 2014 , after a drinking game at a campus party			2
she went with the unnamed attacker to his dorm with the intention of having sex , but changed her mind			2
she tired to physically resist and blacked out from the intoxication			0
her assailant then forced oral sex on her , penetrated her with his digits , and tried to have vaginal intercourse			0
as the alleged assailant has not been criminally charged his name has not been released , and he failed to respond to interview request from @entity25			1
' i froze and there were parts of the night where i could n't fight because it 's not an option , ' @entity3 said			1
she reported the assault to campus police two days later			0
they directed her to have a rape examination at @entity54			0
two weeks later with the exam done , she filed a formal complaint , but the officer told her that her case was n't viable ' because she did not scream ' no ' or violently fight back			0
' she did not go to the @entity59 , fearing they 'd tell her the same thing			0
but she did go after university disciplinary action only to be told one week before the hearing that she would have to be the one to prosecute her alleged attacker			1
that meant making exhibits , penning and opening statement , and putting together witness testimony			0
@entity3 said the school 's campus police told her she did n't have a case as she failed to say ' no ' or ' violently fight back ' she spent the five - hour hearing separated from her alleged attacker by nothing but a paper screen , without any form of security present			1
' i would say the hardest part was hearing his voice because it 's the voice i hear in my flashbacks , ' she said			2
' one of my biggest concerns ... was that he would get aggressive and retaliate			0
' the accused claimed everything was consensual and was found not to be responsible for any wrongdoing			0
she appealed based on the @entity1 's sexual misconduct policy being clear that a person can not give consent if impaired by alcohol or unconscious			1
@entity1 is just one of 94 colleges nationally with pending @entity97 investigations regarding sexual violence			2
@entity3 has since graduated and now studies for a master 's in social work at @entity101			1
' i do n't think it 's the rape that makes the person a victim , ' she said			2
' i think it 's the systemic failure that makes someone from a survivor to a victim			0
... i can honestly say i wo n't stop fighting until those systems change			0
