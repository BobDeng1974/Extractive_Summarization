out on the pitches at @entity4 ’s training centre in @entity6 most mornings , some of the old boys are looking after the future of the club			1
@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are among the former players employed in various coaching roles by @entity4 ’s head of youth development @entity17			2
in a couple of years ’ time , assuming @entity19 winds down his playing career at the highest level , @entity4 will need a strategy for another player they consider to be one of their own			1
@entity19 has been mr @entity4 since signing his first professional contract with the club in 1997 the @entity32 captain has a contract at @entity34 that takes him beyond his 35th birthday there are lessons to be learned following the botched handling of @entity39 ’s last summer after 13 years and 211 goals as a @entity4 player			1
‘ i did n’t even get to say goodbye to the fans , ’ he complained in an interview last weekend			0
he has made it clear how much that small gesture would have meant to him			0
in the great debate about @entity39 ’s perceived treachery for joining @entity50 , take a moment to think about him attending the funeral of former @entity4 physio @entity54 on monday			1
@entity39 had to ask @entity55 for permission to travel south to be at the church service for a man hugely respected by @entity4 players and staff , past and present			1
alongside him was the captain @entity19 , one of @entity4 ’s many representatives after he had taken a coaching session with the @entity63 at @entity64 in the morning			1
at some point there will be a void in @entity19 ’s life at @entity4 and it is important for the club to make sure he has a meaningful and responsible role when that moment arrives			1
@entity19 is a hero to the @entity4 fans - the ' captain , leader , legend ' banner is on show at @entity34 slowly his pr is improving , taking baby steps to repair the damage caused by the @entity83 ’s decision to fine him £ 220,000 and ban him for four games after he racially insulted @entity86			1
@entity19 has always protested his innocence and @entity4 backed him all the way in both @entity89 and the @entity83 hearing			1
@entity19 , for all the problems over the years , remains the soul of the club			2
he is a blue blood			0
one of the biggest issues to confront is the super-salaries of the top players and persuading them to take a massive drop in income as part of a continuity package			0
@entity19 and @entity39 enjoyed glory - filled years as team - mates at @entity4 but @entity39 was allowed to leave @entity34 last season and is at @entity4 's title rivals @entity50 @entity19 probably earns somewhere in the region of £ 7.5million as a @entity4 player , but he would be a paid a fraction of that if he was on the first - team coaching staff			1
this is an area for @entity4 to consider , to find a way of bridging the salary gap and employing him in various areas of the club to make it appealing			1
the transition from player to manager is rarely smooth , but @entity19 has designs on succeeding @entity121 at @entity34 at some point in the future			2
his next playing contract , which will take him beyond his 35th birthday , is a ‘ formality ’ according to @entity121			1
@entity39 was another long - serving player who had a special place in the hearts of the @entity4 faithful beyond that , it is time for @entity4 to consider what is next because they simply can not afford to let @entity19 leave @entity34 through the back door			1
there are lessons to be learned from @entity136 , where their failure to make plans for @entity140 ’s future beyond his playing days has cost them			2
most people working within the game believe this to be a mistake			0
two years previously they lost another core member of that @entity136 team when they allowed @entity148 to retire without thinking the consequences through			0
when @entity140 leaves for @entity151 in the summer , there is a possibility that @entity136 will field a team under @entity154 next season without a local boy in dressing room			0
@entity140 , another one of the @entity159 old guard , is being allowed to walk away from @entity136 this year upstairs there are traces of the old boot room mentality , with @entity164 an ambassador of the club , but sadly the role appears to have limited responsibilities			2
at @entity170 , where the influence of former players has always played a large part in the club ’s thinking , they always try to do the right thing			0
@entity177 moved seamlessly on to the coaching staff when sir @entity179 retired and he is an important member of @entity181 's technical set - up at @entity182			0
others have not been forgotten , with @entity184 ( director of youth academy ) , @entity187 ( global ambassador ) and sir @entity189 ( @entity170 director ) playing significant roles			0
they are there to ensure continuity , to make sure that the @entity170 legend lives on and to impress the culture of the club on staff and players who have never experience life at @entity170			0
it is 10 years since @entity121 , with help from @entity39 and @entity19 , started picking up regular silverware @entity19 has designs on succeeding @entity121 as manager of @entity4 one day one day , probably long after his playing career has ended , @entity19 will accept that he tested @entity205 to the limit over the various scrapes he has been in over the years			1
what can not be ignored is his contribution to the club on the field			0
last weekend , when he took to the field for @entity4 ’s @entity214 clash with @entity215 , he drew level with @entity39 with his 648th appearance			2
only @entity218 ( 729 ) and @entity219 ( 795 ) , both sourced from the club ’s youth team in the @entity223 , are ahead of him now			0
at 34 , @entity19 remains the last player to successfully graduate form @entity4 ’s academy to become an established first - team player			2
since 1997 , when he signed his first professional contract at @entity34 , no - one has rivalled him			0
with @entity19 around the place , changing that could be a priority .			0

@entity4 must make sure @entity19 has a role when he stops playing
blues captain @entity19 's contract takes him beyond his 35th birthday
the club must not let him go the same way as @entity39
@entity50 , @entity4 's title rivals , now have @entity39 on their books
