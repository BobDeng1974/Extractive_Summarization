by @entity0 furious pensioners have been ordered to replace their letterboxes for health and safety reasons - at a cost of £ 350			1
residents at @entity7 in @entity8 were called to a meeting by housing association @entity10 and told their letterboxes no longer complied with fire safety rules			1
the company said changes must be made to meet new fire regulations and it asked a contractor to provide the quote as a ' goodwill gesture '			1
residents at @entity7 , in @entity21 , @entity8 , have been told they have got to replace their letterboxes , pictured , for health and safety reasons but the 32 residents - aged between 55 and 90 - said they are unable to afford the quote and have slammed the company for the ' rip - off ' request			1
a spokeswoman for @entity10 was unable to explain the difference between the existing and proposed letterboxes - but said the current ones did not comply with regulations			0
@entity31 , 67 , said : ' this is absolutely ridiculous			0
' i do n’t know anybody who would pay that money for a letterbox and there are quite a few people that are going to refuse to do it			0
' they seem to find expensive ways of doing things			0
everybody here is over 55 and we have people who are 90			1
' there are a lot of people who do n’t have an awful lot of money and just their pension to live on - they are not rich people			0
' the leasehold homes in @entity21 , @entity8 were built in 1988 and are let by @entity10			2
residents at @entity7 , pictured , said they were given a quote of £ 350 to replace their letterboxes the company said the upgrades need to be carried out after an independent consultant ’s assessment found the letterboxes no longer met fire regulations			1
residents said they had been told that while the letterboxes themselves cost between £ 50 and £ 90 it would take a day to fit just two - bumping up the price with labour costs			1
@entity10 said the quote was simply a ' ballpark ' figure and there was no deadline for residents to carry out the improvements			2
a spokeswoman said : ' as the residents own their flats within the scheme , they are responsible for these properties			0
' their obligations , which include ensuring their homes comply with fire regulations , are included in their lease agreement			0
housing association @entity10 said upgrades needed to be carried out after an independent consultant 's assessment found the letterboxes no longer meet fire regulations ' the safety of residents is of paramount importance to us and we have a duty of care to those living in the buildings we manage			1
' we have therefore advised people living at @entity7 to carry out this work in accordance with their lease agreement to eliminate what has been independently identified as an area for concern			2
' if they choose not to , there is the risk that - in the event of a fire - someone may be injured or even killed			0
' at the request of some of the residents , we asked an independent contractor to provide a quote for this work			2
residents are under no obligation to use this contractor			0
