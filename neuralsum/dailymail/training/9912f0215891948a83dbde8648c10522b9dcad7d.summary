this remains one of the most remarkable and generous acts , from any owner , in any sport			0

' over the years he became a great friend and mentor , not only to me and my family but to many , many people associated with the @entity113 and the @entity179			0
' he was one of this country 's great , eccentric characters , philanthropists and football supporters who combined huge commercial vision in his business interests with the desire to put something back into his community and to make a real difference to the causes he loved			0
' @entity1 was obviously one of his greatest passions and he still retained the same love for the club – the same glint in his eye – that he had as a youngster climbing underneath @entity74 's turnstiles , despite the inevitable ups and downs associated with running a football club			0
' he was a truly special man and retained to the end enormous optimism , conviction and enthusiasm for @entity1 always tuning in live to watch or listen to the matches regardless of where he was in the world or what time of day or night it was			0
' we 're all united in mourning but at the same time it 's a moment to celebrate his life and achievements , a life painted in bright colours , which made a huge difference to so many people at home and abroad			0
' it 's a time to reflect on everything sir @entity0 did for @entity1 and for the tremendous and unique legacy he has left behind for the @entity113 and the @entity179 of @entity128			2
