' so i figured why not look into the one in @entity7 ? i really liked the way that it was run , the director that ran it , it seemed like a really healthy , well - run state program			2
so i decided to go there since i was living there anyway			0

' at least this year in @entity7 , we had such strong compeititon			0
all the girls were not only beautiful , they were smart , college - educated well - rounded women …			0
i think it was a really tough competition			0
' however there are other pagaent insiders who think it 's wrong to move to compete in a different state , even if the girls do it according to competition rules			0

sources say @entity12 set up a *phoney* residency in @entity7 where the state competition was smaller
they say she continued to live and work in @entity11 where she competed in 2010 , 2011 and 2012
@entity12 shot down the claims and said she has been living and working as a model in @entity56 for the past 18 months
claims come as @entity12 continues to get criticized for her comments in the competition
said the rise of sexual assault on campus could be helped if women learned self - defense
comments were controversial since it puts *responsibility* on women - and not men - for preventing sexual violence
