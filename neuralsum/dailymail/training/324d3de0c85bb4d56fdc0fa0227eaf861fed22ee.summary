by @entity0 ' she implores you to love , love , love her ' : @entity4 is pictured on @entity5 yesterday former @entity6 star @entity4 made her debut on @entity8 ’s rival @entity5 yesterday			1
the show , which replaces the struggling @entity10 , has been modelled on @entity11 and opened with ex-strictly come dancing contestant @entity12 and co-hosts @entity13 , @entity15 and @entity16 seated at a glass desk			1
here , @entity18 gives her verdict on @entity8 ’s latest bid to win back early morning viewers			1
@entity4 is the marquee name launching @entity8 ’s new breakfast programme @entity5			1
for two - and - a - half hours on the debut show , @entity4 gives it all she ’s got – and then some			1
she talks , she walks from desk to sofa to chair and back again , this time without the aid of a choreographer			2
she grills politicians , she giggles with guests , she pours herself down the camera and wills you , begs you , implores you to love , love , love her as much as she loves herself			2
if you thought her cha cha on the last series of @entity40 was effortful , just watch @entity4 try to win over the breakfast nation – and sparkle at dawn without the aid of @entity44 , there were times when it was painful viewing			1
‘ have you got that monday morning feeling , as you manage to drag yourself into the kitchen and the bathroom ? ’ she asks at one point			2
no , @entity4 , but it is creeping up on me			1
@entity5 has a logo in the form of a yellow teardrop – a terrible omen ? – and signs which flash onscreen to let viewers know what is going on			1
every now and again there is a @entity63 or something that is new this morning			2
top stories include an item about a family with 16 children and some footage of pop group @entity71 , which is relentlessly plugged			2
@entity4 is rather off beam when talking from the studio to the mother of the 16 children , admitting that she has a problem remembering the names of her own three boys			1
really ? that ’s awkward			0
behind the desk : @entity16 , miss @entity4 , @entity13 and @entity15 are pictured on the @entity8 show debut shows are invariably clumsy , but this one was more glitch - ridden and clenched than most			1
cues were missed , while presenters talked over each other as if they were trying to impress at a speed dating night			0
you could sniff the shredded nerve ends and collective anxiety , as potent as frying bacon , crisping in the air			0
in the @entity8 studios , @entity4 is the leader of a quartet of chummy broadcasters ; each of them resplendent in plasticated high - def make up , super-bouncy blow dries and regulation neon dentistry			1
during the very first minutes of the very first episode of @entity5 , a chirpy weathergirl regretfully informs viewers that the outlook is @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
soon after @entity5 began at 6am yesterday viewers took to @entity110 to ask why they were not able to see more of miss @entity4 , who was poached from the @entity6 on a salary of around £ 400,000			1
one commented : ‘ why has @entity8 paid so much for @entity4 only to put her behind a desk ? it ’s like buying a @entity114 and keeping it in the garage			1
’ another asked : ‘ how many thousands of people turn back to @entity6 after @entity4 has a desk spoiling view of her legs ? ’ a third said : ‘ @entity5 they have @entity4 behind a desk ! ! really the best legs in the country stuck behind a desk ! ’ no doubt to their relief , after ten minutes she stepped from behind the desk and moved to a chair for an interview about changes to benefits			1
there were also tweets in praise of co-host @entity15 , poached from @entity136 , with one calling her ‘ the only one who does n’t seem nervous ’			0
now that we ’ve got the nicknames for the new presenters out of the way , can we get on with the show ? so it ’s anchors away , with @entity15 , @entity13 and mandatory sports dude @entity16 ; all of them crowded with @entity4 behind a glass desk			1
is it a panel show , is it a game show – or is @entity150 going to appear at any minute and press his red buzzer ? i do hope not			2
the guest for their first show is ‘ legendary chat show host @entity156 ’ , which is hardly a scoop as the old boy is rarely off the network			2
@entity4 informs us that he is going to be talking about his most recent heart attack			1
behind the presenters , there is a view of the sparkling @entity167 and @entity168 , basking in the sunshine under a clear blue sky			0
ominously , this is a fake view , which only adds to the sense of fraught claustrophobia			0
in reality it is a grey and damp morning in @entity177 , as confirmed by the weathergirl , who is annoying me already			0
‘ you can find out what april showers are by checking out my blog , ’ she says			0
do n’t mind if i do n’t , luv			0
however , if you happen to be the only over-five in the entire @entity186 who does n’t know what rain is , go right ahead			0
@entity8 are pinning all their hopes on @entity4 , the former @entity6 presenter who gained much apparent popularity after @entity40			1
yet while lots of men love @entity4 ’s obvious charms , i have always felt that women find her flinty , head girl persona a little more resistible			1
can she really deliver the audiences that @entity8 crave ? yesterday she wore an elegant red dress , with cape sleeves			1
weirdly , she keeps her left elbow aloft for most of the programme , presumably to show off the drape of the cape			2
no matter , i think red is her signature colour in the way that yellow is a queen bee ’s signature colour or brown is favoured by the dung beetle			0
it ’s just so her ! @entity212 matter : former @entity6 star miss @entity4 makes an early arrival at the @entity8 studios for her first day @entity4 has said she really wants to connect with @entity8 viewers , and makes a big breakfast effort to do this			1
sometimes she does her happy face , sometimes , when broadcasting serious news items , she does her concerned face , but quite a few times on the launch edition of @entity5 the mask slips and she does her annoyed face instead			1
especially when she makes a mistake and blames others			0
‘ someone is putting extra words in my head , ’ she snaps when she fluffs a line			0
then she gets all ‘ discombobulated ’ and ca n’t hide a flash of bad temper when she misreads the autocue			0
@entity238 , my diva antenna are twitching like worms at the spectacle of a star being quick to blame others during a live broadcast			0
and all this on a breakfast television show ! i shudder to think what @entity4 would be like if she was a big @entity246 star and someone did n’t peel her avocados or steam press her flesh - coloured tights in her @entity251			1
frightening ! tragically , @entity246 reporter and @entity10 leftover @entity252 is still there – a man who has the colour and charm of a burnt pasty			2
@entity258 , what ’s the latest on the @entity260 getting married story ? ‘ no official confirmation , but then again , no official denial either , ’ says @entity258			0
back in the studio , @entity4 thinks the wedding will be a ‘ pretty incredible affair ’			2
‘ sizeable , ’ ventures @entity268			0
@entity156 is still in the hospitality room			0
‘ i ’m nodding off here , ’ he says , rather disobligingly			0
still , he spoke for us all			0
back in the studio , you could cut the fake bonhomie with a plastic picnic knife			0
‘ that ’s chemistry , ’ says @entity4 , as she and @entity268 talk over each other yet again			2
fake laughter echoes around the studio , from those off as well as onscreen as if they were attending a lovely party			0
the @entity282 of the @entity186 breakfast show seems complete			2
@entity4 ends the first show sitting on the cream sofa with @entity156 , who sends viewers home happy with his tales of coronary failure and pet chemotherapy			1
the last word comes from @entity291			0
‘ this is not the best start to the day , ’ she says , pointing to a dull front moving in			0
