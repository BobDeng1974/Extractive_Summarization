by @entity1 reporter published : 09:30 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 09:30 est , 19 july 2012 most people reach for the sun hat and lotion during the summer months , but one young boy has such sensitive skin he has to be covered in factor 50 cream every day			1
@entity8 , four , has albinism , which means he has very little pigment in his skin , hair and eyes making him extremely susceptible to skin cancers			1
he must stay away from the sun as much as possible but when his parents @entity17 , 34 , and @entity18 , 40 , do take him out they have to cover him in factor 50 sun block			2
@entity8 with parents , @entity17 and @entity18			1
mrs @entity22 said she found it hard to deal with attention from strangers @entity8 wears glasses because he is partially sighted and suffers from involuntary eye movement and photophobia			1
the family home in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , is also fitted out with dark blinds to keep out the light and their car has tinted windows			1
mrs @entity22 said that when @entity8 was born she was shocked , as unlike his older siblings @entity38 , 9 , and @entity39 , 6 , his hair was white , his skin was pale and his violet eyes were tightly shut			1
she said : ' he did n't open his eyes for the first three or four days and we were worried that he was blind			2
' my other two children were born with dark hair , we had no idea we had the albinism gene			2
it was quite a shock because nobody else in the family had it and it was a steep learning curve			2
' @entity17 said that initially doctors failed to recognise the condition and only diagnosed albinism four months after he was born			2
she said : ' i did n't know anything about albinism			0
i knew he was different but i did n't know what it was then			0
the only place i could find out was the internet			0
' @entity8 only managed to open his eyes outside when he was seven months old and even then only when wearing dark sunglasses			1
mrs @entity22 said : ' we got him some wraparound sunglasses and it was a really exciting day to see him open his eyes			2
' he wears a big hat when he 's outside and can only see his feet , he 'll never be able to drive a car but he has enough vision to get around			1
' because he 's got no melanin , the way his eyes are connected to his brain is quite different , which has an impact on what he sees as well			0
' neither of @entity8 's siblings @entity38 and @entity39 have albinism protection : @entity8 must always wear factor 50 as he is susceptible to skin cancers mrs @entity22 said one of the hardest things about the condition was dealing with others comments			1
she said : ' what i 've learnt is most people are just curious and my response is to be positive			0
he does get people looking at him but its more me and my husband who are bothered - he ca n't see them very well ! ' he 's not fussy about people asking him because he does n't want to be different			0
we 've taught him to be patient and kind about it , but it will get harder as he gets older			0
' we 're educating his brother and sister , because they hear people talking about him and do n't really know what to say			0
' my eldest son gets very upset and does n't want people saying things about his wee brother			0
' @entity8 will start @entity30 primary in august and the school have been adapting lighting and putting up uv shields for him			1
the family are looking at white stick training and guide dogs for @entity8 and are thinking of sending him to @entity119 when he 's older			1
mrs @entity22 said that her only hope for the future is that @entity8 gets to live a meaningful life as possible , doing something he wants to do			1
she added : ' i just want him to be able to go where he wants to and do what he wants to			0
' it 's just a bit of extra work to get him there , at the end of the day he could have something far worse			0
' yes his vision 's poor , yes he 's a little bit different , but he 's got so much going for him			0
