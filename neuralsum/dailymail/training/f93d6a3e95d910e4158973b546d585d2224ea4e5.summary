by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 yet another @entity2 comes and goes but still @entity3 remains the only @entity5 captain whose hands have reached out to grasp football ’s @entity7 and raise it aloft			1
’ thus begins the updated and significantly expanded publication of my biographical labour of love about the most iconic figure of all in the rich anthology of @entity16 football			2
what more fitting way to celebrate the 50th anniversary , in 2016 , of @entity5 ’s only @entity2 glory than to rectify the shameful failure to elevate the winning captain to football ’s company of knights ? defining moment : @entity5 captain @entity3 plants a kiss on the @entity2 trophy in 1966 long time : it is almost 50 years since @entity5 won the @entity2 and the @entity5 failed again this summer this is the question , still vexed all these 21 years after @entity3 ’s premature death , which is put , with considerable vehemence , at the end of the book			1
there can be any number of justifications for rushing into print and the two identified above are prominent in the reasoning for this revised @entity39 begets the other			2
the descent into mediocrity of the nation which gave birth to the greatest game steepened at @entity46 2014 , from which a craven @entity5 were eliminated in record time : two games and out			1
that stirred the memory of how it all began to go wrong after that dizzying afternoon at the old @entity54 in the summer of ’ 66 when @entity3 wiped his muddied palms on the velvet - covered rail of the @entity58 before receiving the @entity59 from the white - gloved hands of the @entity61			1
it also provoked the thought that this worsening humiliation might have been averted had the @entity76 , instead of freezing @entity3 out , employed the wisdom and experience of their most inspirational captain ... the way @entity70 did with his great friend , exact contemporary and similar personality @entity74 to such unprecedented success			1
over here , in this bastion of @entity16 values , decency and common sense , we do not only print the @entity82			0
@entity86 ’s grand old - fashioned flood of readers ’ letters , many so beautifully crafted , has subsided before the advance of communications technology			0
but that tradition is exceeded now by the millions of emails , texts , tweets and comments posted at our website			0
legends : @entity3 stands alongside his great friend @entity74 at the 1972 @entity100 of course it can be a mixed bag and a few of my respondents are prone to asking : ‘ can you ever go a week without mentioning your mate @entity3 ? ’ a majority , however , share an understanding as to why it is his larger - than - life - size statue which stands guard at the approach to the new @entity54 , not unlike @entity115 at the bridge			1
some are old enough to relive through @entity3 ’s printed reminiscence the thrill of that solitary @entity2 triumph : ‘ bursting inside and trembling			1
elated but trying not to get carried away			0
do n’t show too much			0
but even seeing the film years later still gives me the shivers			2
it is the be-all and end - all of football			0
’ those words came echoing down the years to swirl around the multi-coloured promenades of @entity128 this summer			2
this @entity2 was the be-all for @entity70 ’s @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			1
it was the end - all for @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity137 @entity136			0
and it was another death , this one not so small , for the @entity16 game			0
that is the relevance of @entity3 today			1
learned professors warn us that we forget our history at our peril			0
our most cherished game has paid the price for ignoring a national hero until he died			0
another rummage through the notes and recordings of our conversations down the years unearthed this prophecy of sporting catastrophe , uttered before @entity154 and @entity155 came , failed , took the money and ran : ‘ the @entity5 job is for an @entity158 , not someone from abroad			1
every country has its football culture and it takes one of our own to understand how the @entity16 player works			0
early exit : @entity5 were knocked out of this summer 's @entity2 after the group stage in @entity46 foresight : @entity3 said , long before foreigners @entity154 ( left ) and @entity155 ( right ) took charge , that the job of @entity5 manager is one for an @entity158 ‘ anyway , a national team should be all about people from that country — from the manager through the players , all the way down to the tea lady			1
‘ and by the way , no country has ever won the @entity2 with a foreign manager			1
’ and that is still true today			0
@entity3 passed away before @entity180 was appointed @entity5 head coach in 1994			1
what he said comes as a rebuke from beyond the grave for the @entity76 ’s failure to secure @entity186 for the @entity187 following his thrilling run to the semi-final of @entity100 ’ 96 : ‘ @entity180 is one of the most intelligent coaches and inspiring man - managers i have ever known or worked with			1
’ it would be hard for the blazered @entity76 to deny having turned up their pompous noses at the @entity196 footballer , even more than they did at other great men who they tended to look down upon as muddied oafs			1
so i am certain @entity3 would have shared my gratification at including in his biography , now , the public apology from a more recent @entity76 chairman , @entity205 , for that organisation ’s neglect of its @entity2 - winning captain			1
there was a belief that higher honours had been denied @entity3 because of the accusation levelled against him of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery shop in @entity215 en route to the 1970 @entity2 finals in @entity217			1
false : @entity3 ( second right ) was wrongly accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery shop in 1970 those charges were false and withdrawn but they famously consigned him to house arrest , delaying his arrival in @entity217 , and he sensed the stigma had stuck in some quarters			2
so i am obliged to reaffirm him telling me that ‘ one of the younger lads in the squad did something foolish , a prank with unfortunate consequences			0
’ whodunnit ? years later , at the mellow end of one of our very long evenings , @entity3 entrusted me with the name of the suspect on the sworn pledge never to reveal it , at least not before both he and the culprit died			1
that , i will continue to honour for so long as i live			2
in that imposing statue at @entity54 , for which i had the privilege of writing the inscription			0
in the annals of his countless commanding performances			0
through the sadness which engulfed his first wife @entity247 , daughter @entity248 and his grandchildren at the tragic and premature loss of the only other male member of the family , his son @entity251			0
his legacy includes the fund for fighting the bowel cancer which killed him , for which the devoted efforts of his widow @entity257 have raised more than £ 20million , thus far			0
legacy : the @entity259 has raised more than £ 20million to tackle bowel cancer living on : @entity257 , wife of @entity3 , opened the first @entity261 since his death 21 years ago the accolades have kept coming : elected to @entity265 ’s @entity264 , voted into the @entity266 , inducted into the @entity267 , named as @entity5 ’s @entity268 in @entity270 ’s list of the 50 greatest @entity272 footballers			1
still no place in the pantheon of sir @entity276 , sir @entity277 , sir @entity278 , sir @entity279 , sir @entity280 , sir @entity281 , sir @entity282 , sir @entity283 , sir @entity284 and sir @entity285			0
the honours committee reacted too slowly after @entity3 ’s illness became public , and now hide behind the rules prohibiting knighthoods after death — despite including the nation ’s law - makers in their group			2
one segment of the biography contains these sentiments : in all honesty , in all decency , in all sanity an exception should be made to the protocol which refuses posthumous knighthoods			2
this is a national hero			0
it can not be beyond @entity306 ’s resources to enact a specific statute of exemption			2
in the shocked aftermath of @entity3 ’s death , thousands upon thousands added their signatures to the petitions for him to be knighted			1
now that 50th @entity2 anniversary is fast approaching , let the campaign recommence			2
this time , let it win			0
@entity3 : the @entity317 by @entity0 is published on august 26 by @entity318 at £ 9.99			2
order at mailbookshop.co.uk , p&p is free for a limited time only .			0

almost 50 years after @entity5 won the @entity2 , @entity3 has not been knighted
the @entity76 should have employed @entity3 's wisdom and experience
instead they froze out @entity5 's @entity2 winning captain
long before @entity5 appointed a foreign manager , @entity3 affirmed the need for a *homegrown* boss
@entity306 must act to award a posthumous knighthood
