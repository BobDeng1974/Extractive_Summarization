' our range of tough security measures has already successfully seen the number of seizures increase , but this proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem			0

he said : ' this was a conspiracy run by mr @entity6 to import machine guns and ammunition to be redistributed to those around @entity57 that wanted them			1
