it ’s a classic @entity1 meal loved by families around the world : a juicy lamb joint served with rosemary , roast potatoes , carrots and sprouts			0
but one @entity10 restaurant is giving the traditional roast a twist this spring , serving the entire spread deep - fried			1
in fact , everything on this menu is doused in batter and then fried , from buttered crumpets and cheese strings to @entity21 ’s tea cakes , hot cross buns and even a whole pizza			0
@entity10 's latest pop - up # @entity24 plans to offer more than 100 deep - fried items over the long @entity1 weekend the calorific eaterie is the brainchild of @entity29 , a collaboration between chef @entity31 ( left ) of @entity32 and freelance creative director @entity33 ( right ) , better known as miss @entity34 @entity10 ’s latest pop - up restaurant @entity24 in @entity37 , @entity35 will be serving more than 100 different deep - fried foods during the long @entity1 weekend ( 2 to 5 april )			1
the calorific eaterie is the brainchild of @entity29 , a collaboration between chef @entity31 ’s @entity32 and freelance creative director @entity33 , better known as miss @entity34			1
miss @entity34 told @entity40 : we will be serving deep fried quiche @entity42 , pasties , pork pies , scotch egg , frankfurters and burgers			0
' the pair will also offer fried desserts alongside their savoury items , with doughnuts , cakes and even coconut ices all getting the deep - fried treatment			1
‘ we are handmaking most things , ‘ she continued , ‘ and people are going to bring along stuff for us to fry and we do n’t know what people will bring			0
‘ it has got to be edible and the final decision [ whether they should be deep - fried ] comes from @entity31			1
‘ the fully fried @entity1 feast will serve six people and has to be booked in advance			0
the duo will deep fry cake ( pictured ) , doughnuts , chocolate and even coconut ices as well as sweets # @entity24 will also offer savoury items such as deep - fried pork pies ( left ) and pizza ( right ) ‘ we had this idea at @entity79 as @entity80 is my favourite @entity79 movie , ’ miss @entity34 continued			1
‘ @entity29 loves a good pun - it 's great to see other @entity80 fans get the ' now i have a @entity86 ' reference in the images by @entity88			0
’ she did however admit that the idea is a trifle silly			0
she said : ‘ @entity31 is about to launch his street food concept @entity91 at @entity93 - part of @entity94 - so we want to do something really fun and ridiculous before the hard work begins			2
‘ we also tried deep fried chocolate at @entity31 's previous pop up @entity101 - once i tasted it for the first time i knew i had to revisit ! ' but while the venture has been greeted with interest the pair have no plans to make it into a more permanent thing			1
' it is just for @entity1 - after which @entity31 will continue with @entity111 and i will continue on goodness knows what alongside , ’ miss @entity34 continued			2
‘ the response has been amazing though one dentist on @entity117 said we were " disgusting "			0
‘ so many people want to come and try the foods on offer with deep fried @entity121 getting the strongest response so far			2
