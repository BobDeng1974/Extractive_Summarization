@entity1 creator @entity0 has become a father for the first time after girlfriend @entity4 gave birth to twins today			1
in an announcement published on his @entity9 feed this afternoon , the couple of two - and - a - half years announced that they had welcomed two girls , named @entity13 and @entity14			1
it revealed that the babies were born in @entity17 , @entity18 and described the new mom and dad as ' proud first - time parents			2
the announcement sparked controversy at the time because the couple told how they conceived via @entity34 in order that they could choose the gender of their children			2

' mr @entity0 added : ' i believe people will finally understand my love , respect and admiration for women			1
' almost here ! mr @entity0 , 41 , shared a photo of himself in scrubs at the hospital this morning the new dad gave a clear sign that the babies ' birth was imminent when he shared a photo of himself in hospital scrubs this morning			1
he captioned the image : ' he we go ! ! ! babies are coming now ! [ sic ] ' mr @entity0 , who has long been a hero to teenage boys in spite of his multiple lawsuits and arrests , was introduced to @entity4 when she won @entity1 's ' search for the @entity69 in @entity70 '			1
the couple boast many famous friends , who they said had been offering plenty of parenting advice			0
' @entity76 and @entity77 were the first in the @entity80 family we told and they have already given us so much amazing advice , ' mr @entity0 said			1

girl power : mr @entity0 and his girlfriend of two - and - a - half years used @entity34 to pick the sex of their twins model example : mr @entity0 met miss @entity4 when she won his magazine 's ' search for the @entity69 in @entity70 ' contest in 2012 mr @entity0 ' notoriety came with the launch of his company @entity1 in the late 1990s			1
gender selection is not an open practice , particularly for couples having their first children , but some doctors do bend the rules			0
@entity106 , @entity107 , the @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 all have outright bans on genetic selection for non-medical purposes , but the @entity70 does not			0
in the @entity70 , pre-natal genetic diagnosis tests are available which allows the couple to determine the gender of the embryo before it is implanted			0
fertility clinics make their own rules on where they stand in the issue , so certain clinics allow sex selection on any grounds while others dictate that couples need a medical reason - like certain developmental disorders or genetic diseases - as grounds for dictating the sex			2
an example of a more loose interpretation of the law used by some couples is when they already have several children of the same sex and opt to use @entity34 to make sure their next child is the opposite sex			2

a string of lawsuits and mr @entity0 ' own personal criminal troubles contributed to the downward spiral of the company , and @entity1 filed for bankruptcy in february of last year			1
mr @entity0 spent time in jail after pleading no contest to child abuse and prostitution charges in 2008 and spent nearly a year in jail			1
more recently , he was charged with false imprisonment and assault in 2013 stemming from a night in 2011 in which he grabbed a woman by the neck and slammed her head into the floor of his soon - to - be repossessed home			0
