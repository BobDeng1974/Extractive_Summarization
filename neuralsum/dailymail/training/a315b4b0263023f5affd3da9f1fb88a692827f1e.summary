the national broadcaster has refused to apologise to one of @entity3 's highest profile military officers , captain @entity1 , caught up in a public furore over anti-transgender tweets aimed at her during the popular q&a program			1
viewers have railed against the published comments , even calling for the moderator 's sacking but the @entity12 insists the tweets were ' within guidelines '			1
posts included ' wow she / he is a hero ' and ' @entity19 sets our gender , we should n't interfere ' , angering many viewers of the current affairs panel discussion			1
but an @entity12 spokesperson has told @entity24 that : ' q&a â€™s on - screen tweets are selected through a multi-stage moderation process to provide an alternative layer around the studio discussion based on the commentary of viewers on @entity32 '			1
' we believe the tweets you identify meet those guidelines and were appropriate for broadcast			2
' one of the tweets which offended some viewers one of the tweets considered most offensive originated from an account listed as security advisers , but it was quickly removed as the social media backlash mounted			1
security advisers is an independent group which claims to provide strategic advice to government agencies and corporate @entity3 , and the tweet was apparently sent by mistake			2
while the @entity55 earned praise for inviting a transgender panellist for the first time and seeking her view on how the community can make life easier for those who make a gender choice , the fallout from the reaction of those watching has continued			0
this post from a corporate account of a security firm was quickly deleted but there appears little chance of a public apology , as demanded by some viewers			2

the public backlash also included viewers calling for the sacking of those moderating the published tweets the backlash was immediate , with viewers calling the comments of others ' disrespectful and offensive ' ' i was called a boy for a long time , i was called a lot worse actually too , ' she said on q&a			1
the @entity107 group captain was born @entity108 in 1956 in @entity109 , in @entity110			1
after much heartache and depression , the life - changing event to become a woman took place in 2012			0
' there may be some people who may have felt incredibly conflicted by that language , it did n't , i transitioned quite late in life and had functioned as a male for a darn long time and had far worse stuff said to me from first slip when i was batting at cricket			0
' however , not all the social media comments to the program caused anger , there were those who applauded @entity106 for inviting a transgender panellist for the first time @entity1 is a close friend of prime minister @entity134 after first locking horns on the rugby field in the 1980s			1
