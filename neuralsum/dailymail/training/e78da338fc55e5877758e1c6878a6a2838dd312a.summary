@entity0 has lamented the physical demands placed on his players as he faces up to being without two key players on saturday			1
@entity5 duo @entity4 ( back ) and @entity6 ( knee ) are both doubts for the clash against @entity10			1
the injuries were sustained whilst both players were on international duty , @entity6 with @entity14 and @entity4 with @entity15			1
@entity5 winger @entity6 had to substituted at half - time during @entity14 's win against @entity18 striker @entity4 was forced to missed @entity15 's clash with @entity20 because of a back injury and @entity0 claims club managers are suffering because of the strains put on players			1
‘ the load of constant performance at the highest level takes it ’s toll across the whole of the @entity31 , ’ said the @entity5 boss			1
‘ the demand on the player is so great for so long , so often that eventually they are going to break down at some stage			2
‘ if you look at the load this year on players , it gets greater than ever before			0
not only do they travel at international level across the world but the constant pressure of the @entity31 is every getting faster and more demanding physically and mentally			0
‘ the time they have to rest is fewer and further between and that ultimately ends up with players never really recovering fully enough to go into the next game			2
striker @entity48 is now fit to start for the @entity5 after coming off the bench against @entity50 @entity5 boss @entity0 has bemoaned the injuries picked up by his players on international duty ‘ as hard as we try to prevent those injuries it is an impossibility by the demand on the players – and that demand comes because the player wants ever more money to play for you so it ’s a vicious circle			1
‘ if the players ’ demands came down then perhaps the demands to find more and more money would n’t be as great			0
managing that situation is extremely difficult now			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 says there is still no resolution to central defender @entity71 ’s protracted contract talks			2
@entity71 is out of contract at the end of the season and could leave on a lucrative free contract in the summer			0
@entity0 said : ‘ that ’s an ongoing negotiation with the chairman to make a positive outcome for us			2
i think he [ @entity71 ] is comfortable here , but it ’ll probably go down to money			0
influential defender @entity71 ( front ) is in talks over a new contract to stay at @entity86			0
