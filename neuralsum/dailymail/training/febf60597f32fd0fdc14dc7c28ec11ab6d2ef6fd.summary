' but food experts have pointed out that the ' fruit ' many companies claim on their packaging is actually just balls of sugar and soybean oil , mixed with tiny bits of dried fruit			1
consumer watchdogs warn that some of biggest food companies are fooling us with unhealthy and high - sugar ' fruit imposters ' inside labels promising ' real fruit , full of vitamins '			1
@entity39 , the head of the @entity40 , a consumer watchdog group , told today it actually contains ' no berries whatsoever '			0
mr @entity39 explained that these berry ' imposters ' are in a lot of foods , like blueberry @entity47 and @entity50 's @entity49			0
while the label proclaims ' made with real blueberries , ' it actually contains ' blueberry bits ' which are blue chucks shaped into balls made from ' mostly sugar and soybean oil , then little bits of real blueberry that 's been artificially colored			2
' today 's national investigative correspondent @entity58 said : ' if the companies were in this room , they would say : " look , we 're printing the ingredients on the label			0
no misleading advertising here " ' false advertising : consumer watchdogs say that some of biggest food companies are fooling us with unhealthy and high - sugar ' fruit imposters ' inside labels promising ' real fruit , full of vitamins ' fresh fruit : some food companies said the real fruit on the package is meant as a serving suggestion , which is disclosed in small print fruity breakfast : the label proclaims ' made with real blueberries , ' but it actually contains ' blueberry bits ' shaped into balls made from sugar and soybean oil , with little bits of blueberry that is artificially colored but mr @entity90 disagreed : ' you ca n't deceive people in big print and pictures on the front of the label , and then give the correct answers on the back of the label , ' one shopper said : ' i think they 're duping people			1
it 's complete false advertising			0
' the @entity103 , which oversees such labeling , told today that it ' supports laws requiring labels to be truthful and non-misleading , ' and these labels ' are permitted ' under @entity103 regulations as long as the word ' flavored ' is also printed			1
nutritionist @entity111 explained : ' if you see the word " flavored , " either natural or artificial , it could be a red flag that there 's actually no fruit within that product			2
' ' the @entity103 is asleep at the wheel			0
it rarely brings complaints against these companies , said mr @entity90 , whose own group is suing @entity122 , which owns vitaminwater because ' there are n't any strawberries and there are n't any kiwis in there , ' read the back : the @entity103 says it is consumers ' responsibility to read the entire label , not just the front ' i suspect the @entity103 does n't want to tangle with big companies who could keep them tied up in court for years ... [ but ] that bottle contains almost as much sugar as a 12 - ounce can of @entity122			1
