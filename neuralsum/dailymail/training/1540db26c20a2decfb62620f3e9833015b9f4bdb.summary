by @entity0 last updated at 10:08 am on 26th january 2012 @entity1 plans : @entity2 , pictured at a @entity4 storytelling centre on the 253rd anniversary of the birth of @entity7 , outlined his plans for a referendum in 2014 @entity2 unveiled his plans for a referendum on @entity4 independence yesterday – publishing a question which critics said was ‘ loaded ’ and designed to destroy the @entity14			1
@entity4 ’s first minister outlined a timetable which could see an end to the 300 - year @entity14 of @entity18 and @entity4 by 2016			1
but his plans immediately caused controversy since they appeared designed to subvert the usual democratic safeguards over referendums – or to spark a row with @entity24 which would also boost the @entity26 ’s chances of a @entity28 vote			2
mr @entity2 said @entity4 voters would go to the polls in 2014 – the 700th anniversary of the @entity4 victory over the @entity18 at the @entity33			1
they would be asked : ‘ do you agree that @entity4 should be an independent country ? ’ he said he would allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote , a proposal that contravenes @entity38 election law and is designed to boost support from pro-independence teenagers			1
the @entity26 leader also said that if the @entity4 public demands it , he is prepared to sanction a second question on the ballot paper on whether @entity4 wants beefed up devolution , known as ‘ devo max ’			1
most controversially , mr @entity2 attempted to bypass the usual procedure for holding a referendum in which the @entity49 , which helps to run the vote , has to sanction the question as fair			1
mr @entity2 made clear that he only regards the watchdog ’s role as consultative rather than binding , allowing him alone to decide how the question is ultimately phrased			2
he told @entity4 mps the question that would be put to voters would be ‘ short , straightforward and clear ’			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ @entity1 , in essence , is based on a simple idea : the people who care most about @entity4 , that is the people who live , work and bring up their families in @entity4 , should be the ones taking the decisions about our nation ’s future			1
’ in the big chair : first minister @entity2 , speaking with schoolchildren yesterday , said he wants to extend the right to vote in an independence referendum to 16 and 17 - year - olds a simple question : @entity2 told @entity76 he wants the referendum question to be : ' do you agree your country should be independent ? ' but former @entity81 chancellor @entity80 said : ‘ the question is loaded			1
he is inviting people to endorse the separation of a successful independent nation			0
he is not asking if you want to remain part of the @entity38 , which i would prefer			0
‘ it is asking for trouble and if he tries to push through unfair wording someone will go to court			0
it ’s typical of @entity2 who wants to call the shots on the rules , the conduct , the wording and ultimately what the result means			0
’ ministers viewed the wording of the question as unfair and liable to encourage a @entity28 vote – speculating that mr @entity2 wants to pick a fight			1
one @entity106 source said : ‘ this is all about @entity2 turning around and saying : “ look at all those dreadful people in @entity24 trying to tell us what to do			0
” ’ a @entity112 official added : ‘ @entity2 does n’t have the power to set out the question			2
these are his proposals and they will feed into our consultation			0
but he does n’t have the power to legally set up a referendum			0
‘ the @entity49 should play their usual role in the referendum and that means scrutinising the question			0
they are officially part of the process			0
that is mentioned in our own consultation document			0
’ @entity4 secretary @entity129 said the government would block any bid to introduce a devo max question			2
consultation document : @entity2 holds up a copy of ' your @entity4 , your referendum ' setting out the @entity138 ' roadmap to independence @entity18 will be better without us : mr @entity2 speaking during the @entity141 at @entity142 , @entity24 , on tuesday night ‘ any attempt to pass legislation for either an independence or devo max referendum would be outside the existing powers of the @entity148 and liable to legal challenge , ’ he said			1
‘ we have made it clear that we think the @entity151 would lose such a challenge			0
’ mr @entity2 also faced ridicule yesterday after admitting that the @entity154 would have to bail out an independent @entity4 if it got into financial trouble			1
he conceded that the final say on financial policy would be left with the @entity154 , which would act as lender of last resort if an independent @entity4 were to retain the pound			0
