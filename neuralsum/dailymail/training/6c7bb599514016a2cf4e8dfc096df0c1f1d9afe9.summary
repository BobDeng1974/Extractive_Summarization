by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			2
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			2
this week , @entity12 has his say on @entity15 ' suitability for another job in football , @entity11 's football is producing results at @entity18 , and what he has which is ' similar ' to @entity21 's statue at @entity22 ... @entity23 and downs i thought @entity15 was very open and honest talking candidly about his mental health in football throughout his career , after his dismissal from @entity29 last week			1
it 's something many managers and coaches , including myself , have to overcome			1
losing your job in any walk of life is tough			2
but being in the public eye in a job that you love , the incredible highs and lows , always being busy , it can be very difficult to cope			2
brave : @entity44 spoke openly about his illness throughout his career after his dismissal from @entity29 experience : any club would be lucky to have a coach of @entity15 ' standard click here to read @entity53 's exclusive interview with @entity15 you are a councillor , decision - maker , long - term and short - term planner , recruiter , teacher , charity worker , supporter and mentor			1
as well as picking the team and sorting out training for the players			0
then it 's just one phone - call , or text message , or email , and it stops			2
soon the texts and phone - calls stop and the buzz – the same buzz as all supporters feel come match - day times 100 – is gone from your life			0
you 're lonely , isolated and wondering what the future brings			0
i 'm not sure how you define depression			0
but i 've felt a lack of energy , questioning your own ability , questioning if you 'll ever work again and generally feeling fed up , sad and , at the want of a better word , bereavement			0
@entity89 : @entity15 was speaking to @entity90 's @entity53 about his troubles everyone else gets on with their lives and i guess that feeling is called depression			1
i 'm sure @entity15 will get an opportunity in football once again			1
he 's a gentleman , full of knowledge , had great success and i see it as a strength that he has got help from a therapist and specialists in place to support him and , most of all , give him guidance for the future			2
this will , in my opinion , improve him and he will get better as a manager or coach			0
we must never forget , although people quickly do , the tragic loss of @entity116 less than two years ago , who seemed bright and bubbly on @entity120 just the day before			0
i believe more has to be done to help and support managers who are out of work			0
@entity123 's a shaw thing for @entity125 on saturday i got the chance to visit my old stomping ground to watch @entity18 versus @entity128			1
i 'll tell you one thing i 'm sure about and that 's @entity128 's 18 - year - old left - back @entity131			1
he 's got pace , he 's also got another gear , and goes forward with intent to do damage in the final third			2
he was tested one - on - one defensively all afternoon and he did n't get beaten once			0
solid : @entity131 has the credentials to go all the way , he did n't get beaten once against @entity18 competition : i can see @entity131 usurping @entity142 ( left ) and @entity143 in the @entity125 team perhaps his decision - making in defence was at fault when he did n't track @entity149 's run for @entity18 's first goal			1
but in time , and with experience , that will improve			0
it looks from afar that @entity154 are letting @entity142 slowly run - down his contract and my guess would be that young @entity131 will be moving to @entity157 in the summer			1
with @entity143 edging towards 30 - though , it must be said , he has improved with age like a fine bottle of wine - i 'm sure young @entity131 will be filling the @entity125 left back spot for many , many years to come			1
the @entity163 a lot has been said about @entity11 's way of playing			1
but i have not yet seen a book or manual that states how you have got to play to win a game of football			2
@entity11 has his way and after four straight wins , with his main players now available , not one @entity18 supporter would 've left @entity175 without a spring in their step and the claret - and - blue blood bubbling around their body			1
@entity128 's @entity181 had his team playing from the goalkeeper , through the back four , then the midfield , into the forwards , with both full backs overlapping			1
they were focused on ball retention and moving the opposition to create openings , with a @entity192 style that is good to watch			2
results : @entity11 is getting the three points with his system , and has lifted @entity18 into the top half @entity197 one : @entity199 's goal typified the impressive performance on saturday , when the @entity128 goalkeeper had a goal kick , @entity128 's two centre halves pulled deep and wide , level with their own six yard box and the two central midfield players dropped off to the edge of the penalty area to receive passes to start their attack			1
at no point did he smash it long			0
if those players were marked the keeper attempted a 30 - yard pass with the full backs pushed high - up and wide in the wing positions			0
@entity18 's goalkeeper , @entity218 , kicked the ball 70 yards directly to @entity220 and in one instance the knock - down came to @entity199			1
regret ? @entity181 had his team pass the ball out in defeat , while @entity18 celebrate the win ( below ) his half - volley attempt at goal was blocked and the next pass was played to @entity230 , who on his second touch tried to get a cross in			1
it was blocked and went off for a corner			0
with only three passes the @entity175 crowd were on the edge of their seats in eager anticipation as the corner came in			0
the crowd loved it and at the end of the day , with three points on the board , i 'm sure not one @entity18 supporter could turn round and say , ' i do n't know why we do n't play out from the back and tip - tap it about in our own 18 - yard box '			1
no match - winners , no wins a lot has been made about the lack of goals from the @entity259 teams in @entity260 last week			1
but it surely can come as no surprise			0
@entity263 did n't have @entity264 playing			0
@entity267 did n't have @entity268 in their side			0
no surprise : @entity267 and @entity22 were missing their main strikers in midweek in @entity268 ( left ) and @entity270 so the main strikers , the match - winners , who win these games and make the difference , if you do n't have them playing , you do n't win			1
if @entity22 had signed @entity279 they 'd have won the @entity259 and gone very close in the @entity280 this season			0
@entity282 looks decent , but he 's hardly @entity279 , @entity21 or @entity283 , is he ? potential : but @entity282 is n't going to be the next @entity22 legend ( like @entity279 could have been ) , is he ? mad hot dog speaking of @entity21 , i see @entity22 have recognised the incredible contribution of one of the game 's most amazing players with a statue at the @entity292			1
his incredible talent was so similar to @entity295 , with his arrogance and supreme confidence			0
he used to strut around like the @entity298 , more often than not walking with his eyes squinted like a kestrel looking calmly and quietly for the gap or the opening where he could punish the opposition			0
he was magnificent , one of best of all time			0
legend : @entity21 deserves his statue outside the @entity292 not quite : the closest i 've ever come is ... a @entity309 ! in 2012 they unveiled a statue of sir @entity312 outside @entity313			1
at @entity18 , you 've got the famous @entity315			1
in @entity154 's @entity157 they 've got the @entity316			2
there are loads of them			0
and a couple of years ago my son @entity320 rang me with the news that a street vendor was selling a hotdog with chilli and mustard called the @entity309			0
sadly no stand , or statue			2
on tuesday night , @entity328 and @entity329 were left speechless for the very first time when i was with them on @entity333 's @entity332			1
they were shocked and horrified with my prediction that @entity125 would win the @entity336			1
with their mouths wide open , and all planning from rehearsals now out the window , i explained that with @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , and with @entity348 playing deep in front of the back four , we have a team with pace and self - belief that can test and challenge the very best			2
you just wait and see .			0

more has to be done to help coaches like @entity15
@entity131 is *destined* to be an @entity125 *regular* at left back
@entity11 's style of play is getting the results at @entity18
no wonder @entity366 sides lost in @entity260 ... they were without their main men
@entity21 has his statue ... guess what i have !
