@entity0 has admitted he would prefer to have @entity1 on board before the end of the month to boost @entity5 ’s title challenge			1

‘ i think that ’s the way you have to do it			0
if you do n’t know if the players wants it then it ’s harder to agree between the clubs			0

’ @entity36 are also keen on @entity1 and have seen a bid in the region of £ 100,000 rejected by the @entity40 outfit			2
however , the 24 - year - old is n’t thought to be keen on the prospect of playing in @entity43 and that could leave @entity5 in pole position unless higher - placed @entity47 opposition emerges			2

‘ we ’ve had nothing from no - one and our process with @entity58 is going on , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but he is going to stay until the end of the season			0
‘ it ’s longer - term we have to think about with @entity58 because we are going to have him until the summer			2
‘ his focus looked good last monday [ against @entity78 ] and if he keeps on like that , things are going to be good for both of us			0
’ asked about the possibility of a fee for commons being dangled before the club , @entity0 replied : ‘ if it makes the team worse , then we wo n’t do it			0
