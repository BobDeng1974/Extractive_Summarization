by @entity0 published : 23:52 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 23:52 est , 8 june 2013 the name you choose for your baby gives away your political affiliation , new research has revealed			0
conservatives tend to choose more masculine - sounding names for their children with lots of @entity10 ’s and @entity11 are also fond of choosing names with lots of @entity14 ’s and @entity15 ’s because they sound tough			1
the study showed that people with more left wing views do the opposite and tend to include a lot of feminine words			1
these include l sounds and soft - a endings such as @entity24			1
the findings may give a clue into why president @entity27 and first lady @entity28 , landed on @entity29 and @entity30 for their kids names			1
left wing : first daughters @entity29 and @entity30 were given names by their parents that reflect the family 's liberal orientation on the other end of the spectrum are @entity43 's children			1
the former @entity45 governor of @entity46 gave most of her children hard - sounding names like @entity49 , @entity43 , @entity50 and @entity51 ( @entity52 being the exception )			1
the @entity55 researchers looked at birth records from 545,018 babies born in @entity58 in 2004 , representing 52,589 different names			0
they then compared the names to voting returns in each neighborhood and used these as an indication of their parents ’ political inclination			2
the study found that ‘ soft ’ sounds , like the l in ‘ @entity69 ’ , the a in ‘ @entity70 ’ or the @entity71 in ‘ @entity72 ’ were more likely to be found in areas which voted on the left			2
examples of this include ‘ @entity77 ’ or ‘ @entity78 ’ for a boy or a girl ’s name like ‘ @entity82 ’ - the name of one of vice president @entity86 's daughters			2
conservatives by contrast went for ‘ harder ’ sounds such as @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , names chosen by the family of former presidential candidate @entity95			2
@entity95 & sons : former presidential candidate @entity95 speaks at an event flanked by his sons , most of whom have conservatively - typical hard - sounding names the @entity43 brood : the only @entity103 pictured here without hard - sounding conservatives names are @entity52 , center , and @entity43 herself lead researcher @entity108 , a political scientist at the @entity109 , said that the difference could be to do with perceptions of names that are linked to wealth			1
traditionally masculinity has been linked to economic success , so by giving your child a more masculine name parents could in theory be hoping they will become wealthy too			0
professor @entity108 said : ‘ the fact that we would find any kind of systematic differences , much less the magnitude of differences that we found - i really did not anticipate that			0
‘ i think most of this happens unconsciously ... underneath there is a lot of signalling going on ’			0
another finding related to the kind of names that parents chose			0
@entity137 parents are more likely to choose an obscure name to denote status whilst conservatives usually opt for something more conventional , the study showed			0
left - wing mothers and fathers try to use obscure cultural references to inflate their social position and show how smart they are			2
what 's in a name : couples who choose more outlandish names for their children , like @entity151 and @entity152 , are more likely to be left wing this could explain why many actors and actresses , who usually have left - wing views , choose odd names for their children such as @entity152 and @entity151 who count @entity160 and @entity161 among their brood			1
conservatives by contrast tend to opt for traditional names like @entity166 , @entity167 , or @entity168 because the elites in society have them and they want their children to be part of the club			0
the findings have not yet been published but were presented at the 2013 @entity175 in @entity176 .			0

conservative voters tend to choose masculine sounding names
parents with left wing views choose more feminine names
soft - sounding @entity30 and @entity29 reflect their father 's liberal *ideology* , while @entity49 , @entity43 , @entity50 , and @entity51 have harder conservative names reflecting their @entity45 mother @entity43
