' it was our first family holiday ever , the first time we had gone away with the kids and it was so traumatic			1
' on the first day my three - year - old daughter was sick and then my son and then the rest of us			1
people were being sick everywhere , there were children throwing up all over the place , on the stairs , everywhere			0
' we had to take my daughter @entity23 to hospital and she was really scared , she had to be injected and she had a drip , it was awful			0
' the whole thing was a disaster , we stayed in our room most of the time and we lost our holiday and our money			2
' she was staying at @entity11 's @entity8 with partner @entity64 , 34 , and children @entity66 , nine , and @entity23 , three , having booked with @entity67			1
when they returned from hospital , she said she found the hotel 's swimming pools were closed with no reason given			0

on arrival we had to ask for a new mattress in our room as ours stank of vomit , not a great start			0
' by day two children were being sick all around us , in the dining room and around the pool			0
i ca nâ€™t help but wonder why this is the second year running that this hotel is plagued by bugs when other hotels of a similar standard are not ? ' the fact that our mattress was rancid and would not have been removed unless we asked suggests that although the hotel is being cleaned on the surface , this is not enough			0

@entity139 , head of travel law at @entity135 , said : ' i have spoken to a large number of holidaymakers who have suffered illness at the @entity12 and had their long awaited , hard earned holidays ruined			0
' many families have been forced to spend their holiday attending the local hospital and days confined to their hotel rooms			2

in early june of this year , a very small number of our customers staying at the @entity188 in @entity11 reported a stomach upset , usually lasting approximately 24 to 48 hours			1
' we are aware that a statement was recently issued by a no - win , no - fee lawyer , which contains as yet unsubstantiated allegations with regards to the nature of this illness			2
' preliminary indications from the independent hygiene consultant and our own investigations suggest that this was of a viral nature			0
