by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s huge investment in @entity4 and @entity5 could turn out to be sound business based on an evening when both of them shone as @entity9 resisted the idea of giving @entity11 a second debut			1
the @entity13 looked on as @entity4 effectively made all three of the goals , with the promising pre-season form of @entity9 ’s team continuing against a team they have almost colonised with loan signings these past four years			2
while only a friendly it was hard not to be drawn to the all - round quality of the £ 32 million signing from @entity22 in his eighty minutes on the pitch , despite clashing with @entity26 skipper @entity25 after being on the receiving end of a heavy tackle			1

' he 's very intelligent the way he presses and he 's a team man , ' said the @entity3 chief			0
' he had two big chances to score but he prefers not to risk , but played for the team			0
we can feel he 's happy to be with us and we 're very happy with it			0
' @entity4 immediately impressed when latching on to a delightful through ball from @entity51 and then unselfishly put @entity91 through when he could have scored himself			2
the @entity92 was involved again when he surged at the @entity26 defence and was brought down just outside the area , resulting in a shoving match with opposing captain @entity96			2
from there £ 27 million @entity97 stepped up to skilfully curl the ball past the despairing @entity99			1
friendly fire : @entity4 clashes with @entity26 's @entity25 @entity4 finished his evening ’s work by darting through the defence before again squaring the ball to give @entity51 the simplest of chances to convert			1
with a better first touch @entity38 could have had a hat - rick by half - time , while @entity40 was also kept busy at times , notably when saving at the feet of the eyecatching @entity111			0
if @entity4 was constantly involved then it was another torrid evening for @entity55 , who veered from the anonymous to the disinterested			0
substitute @entity113 scrambled a late consolation for @entity26			0
ouch ! @entity4 took exception to this hefty tackle by @entity66 looking on : @entity11 , @entity116 and @entity117 watched from the sidelines @entity119 , surplus to requirements at @entity3 , returns to @entity122			1
