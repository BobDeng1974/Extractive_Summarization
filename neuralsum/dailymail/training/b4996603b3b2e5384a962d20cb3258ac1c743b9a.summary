speaks for itself : @entity2 users are furious that the product is being sold and called the tops ' disgusting ' @entity2 has removed a t - shirt range bearing sickening messages about sex crime and violence towards women			1
the t - shirts pulled from sale by the online retailer included phrases like @entity14 , @entity15 , keep calm and choke her , @entity17			1
the @entity19 firm that makes the shirts , @entity18 , blamed a ‘ computer ’ error for the offensive slogans			1
but @entity25 mp @entity24 said : ‘ these are ridiculous , mindless products for anybody to attempt to sell			0
it is absurd to say they were manufactured in error			0
’ a flood of complaints on social - networking websites prompted the decision by @entity2			1
@entity18 sold the short - sleeved t - shirts for between £ 15 and £ 17 on the warehouse website			1
but potential customers were clearly not willing to buy the deeply offensive t - shirts , slamming both @entity2 and the clothes shop , which has its headquarters in the @entity42			1
users branded the shop and its message ' disgusting ' and ' disturbing '			2
but on @entity18 's @entity48 page , someone wrote under the company name that they had ' no idea ' that the message was printed and said it had been computer generated			1
founder @entity53 said : ' no words can express how i feel about what has occurred and in no way do i condone or promote this serious issue			0
@entity59 : t - shirts with slogans saying keep @entity62 and knife her and keep calm and hit her were still on @entity2 today , but could not be ordered the shirts were blasted by @entity68 users , prompting @entity2 to withdraw them and the manufacturers to remove the offensive words from their ' scripted computer process ' he added : ' both myself and our company and it 's associated @entity18 brand have never had any intention of the spread of violent slogans or even poor taste humour t - shirts			1
this was a computer error of my creation and i accept my responsibility in the matter			0
' on the same @entity48 page , it shows people who appear to be employees , apparently hand - printing other t - shirts - although it is unclear whether this is the process for every shirt			1
they posted a variety of responses to @entity48 users , saying they had deleted the product and saying that the message had been generated from the dictionary			2
but shirts with other disturbing messages , like @entity17 , were still displayed on the site at time of writing , although they can not be ordered			0
the solid gold bomb facebook page claimed a computer programme had generated the offensive slogan the website said they were deleting the tshirts and said they appreciated everyone 's ' understanding ' of the mistake manufacturers @entity18 has suspended their @entity68 and @entity48 feeds in the wake of the scandal columnist @entity117 also tweeted : ' wow			1
keep calm & hit her t - shirts on @entity2			1
what a massive mellow - harsher			0
' @entity119 wrote : ' i 'm disgusted by this product , and can think of no good reason for such a slogan			0
that someone thought it was a good idea disturbs me somewhat			0
' @entity127 wrote : ' you guys are kidding with this shirt 's slogan , right ? in what universe is that shirt remotely acceptable in civilized society ? gross			0
' @entity135 demanded answers from both the creators and @entity2 : ' in what society is this even acceptable ? and why is @entity2 listing these ? there is no possible justification including a misplaced sense of irony for wearing a tshirt with this message on it			2
' @entity146 wrote : ' i am sick and tired of the perpetuation of rape culture			0
can you not think for one second about how assault victims feel when seeing something like this ' rape them ' t - shirt ? ' can you not see how this contributes to the view that it 's okay to rape other people ! ? this is not the kind of product i expect to see on @entity2			2
' @entity162 said : ' that 's advocation of abuse and criminal behaviour			0
do you really want to get shut down that badly ? ! i am ashamed of you , @entity2 ! how dare you exploit a felonious , heinous act			2
take that damnable thing down before someone brings the law against you ! if i do not see it removed , i shall boycott and spread the word			0
' others were outraged that @entity2 would allow such a product to be sold , and told them to ' pay their taxes ' - a reference to the probe into the sprawling business ' tax payments , which came under scrutiny last year			2
@entity2 were attacked for allowing the t shirts to be sold , with many saying the message is offensive someone claiming to represent the firm initially wrote on the @entity48 page : ' these ' keep @entity62 ' shirts were computer generated and we did n't even know we had a shirt that says that ... as soon as we realised this , we immediately deleted them			1
' it takes time for them to be deleted			0
' i was the person responsible for running the script that generated the t - shirt , not the company , not any other individuals			2
' i appreciate everyone 's comments but please , accept this as a mistake as we certainly do not condone " rape " ... ' @entity68 users vented their fury that the t - shirts ' promote rape ' and also poke fun at the serious sexual assault			1
angry users urged others to email the clothes shop and @entity2 to express their disgust and demands that it be removed from sale			1
@entity2 reveiwers flooded the ' feedback ' panel with comments expressing their thoughts on the ' awful ' product @entity2 customers quickly rounded on the company and the seller , saying that the people who wore the branded shirts are ' scum ' the brightly - coloured tops ' message are a twist on the ' @entity233 ' morale - boosting slogan used in @entity234 by the @entity235			1
the offensive t - shirts were a result of a problem with a computer programme used by manufacturers @entity18			1
the programme uses a list of words to generate a mocked - up graphic of the t - shirt that appears to shoppers on @entity2			2
it generates random variations on the ' @entity233 and ... ' formula and then prints them on demand if someone decides they like it and order it			0
founder @entity53 says the problem arose because some of the words in the company 's list of 700 words - chosen for design and length reasons - ' both individually and in combination were or became offensive '			0
he said : ' this was a computer error of my creation and i accept my responsibility in the matter			0
' the message has experienced a boom in popularity in recent years , and sparked a trend in shops producing products such as tea - towels , posters and cushions , bearing the slogan , or a play on it			2
@entity18 , who produce the t - shirts , was created and launched from @entity283 , @entity284 , and describes itself as a ' small global t - shirt company '			1
they write on their website about their range : ' we managed to list our @entity233 parody series on the site			0
' @entity292 , beat on and @entity294 are @entity293 ! rock on ! ' @entity2 's sale policies say that in terms of offensive material : ' @entity2 reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of listings posted to our site			2
' it says its policy concerning nudity and pornography : ' in general , images that portray nudity in a gratuitous or graphic manner are prohibited			0
' amateur pornography , pornography , x-rated movies , and hard - core material including magazines are also prohibited			0
' neither @entity2 or @entity18 were available for comment when contacted by the @entity315 .			1
