by @entity0 more than five months after an @entity4 woman was shot by a police officer armed with a @entity7 gun , blinding her left eye , @entity2 police are yet to reveal the findings of an investigation into the officer who fired it			1
@entity13 was hit inside her home , in @entity15 , south of @entity16 , during an altercation with police back in february			1
soon after , the state 's @entity18 launched an investigation set - up to explore the conduct of the officer who fired the weapon , and whether the police officer 's claim of self defence was justified			2
@entity13 was struck with a taser fired by a police officer , leaving her blind in one eye			1
the officer , who was a skilled taser user and trainer , alleged ms @entity13 was threatening police with a table leg which had nails protruding from it			1
but the case , now more than five months in , is still being investigated and civil libertarian and criminal lawyer @entity38 wants to know why			2
mr @entity38 has questioned a lack of urgency by police and has demanded that the @entity2 police commissioner @entity42 give reasons why the investigation has taken so long			1
' it 's an unacceptably long time ' : lawyer @entity38 claims the investigation by @entity2 police is lagging			1
' why has it taken since february ? it 's now july , ' he told @entity50			0
' why has it taken so long for such a straightforward issue to be investigated			0
' he said ' it 's an unacceptably long time ' and has accused police of delaying the investigation on the grounds that the case is not ' high profile			0
' ' the fact is that when police want to , ( they ) pump resources into high profile issues that they choose			0
' in relation to complaints against police , they are given a low priority			0
they are deliberately delayed in the hope that journalists will forget it , and in the hope that complainants will just get sick of the delay and give up			0
' the investigation was launched immediately after the february incident			2
mr @entity38 who has met with ms @entity13 said she is still waiting to hear of the outcome of that investigation			2
police have said there is still one further witness to be interviewed and a final report is expected to be completed by july 30 .			0
