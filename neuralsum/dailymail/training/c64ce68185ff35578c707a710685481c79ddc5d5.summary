by @entity0 he might have been ‘ held together by tape ’ , but that did not stop @entity4 adding the @entity6 title to his @entity8 long jump gold on wednesday			1
this was the one he really wanted , after all ; the title that @entity4 felt he needed to silence all those who have unfairly labelled his achievement on ‘ @entity14 ’ two years ago as ‘ lucky ’			1
that is why he had been talking about these games since winning at @entity17 and why he has overcome the ruptured hamstring that nearly forced him to quit athletics , 36 pain - killing injections and a damaged left knee to pursue his dream of winning in @entity23			1
beaming : @entity24 's @entity4 is all smiles as he holds up his gold medal for winning the long jump @entity6 champion : @entity4 won the long jump final with a leap of 8.20m on wednesday evening punch the air : the 27 - year - old celebrates on day seven of the @entity33 after his win is confirmed even on tuesday @entity4 ’s therapist , @entity35 , had to drive up from @entity36 to treat his left hamstring			1
‘ this is one of the best feelings of my life , ’ said @entity4 , who won a silver medal four years ago in @entity39			1
‘ people are always going to write you off			0
the @entity8 came as a shock to some people , but i had been working so hard for that moment in @entity36			0
‘ this year i have probably been working beyond hard to make sure that i could win a major title again			0
‘ i considered quitting at one point with my hamstring , so the fact i have managed to win a major championship is just amazing			2
’ even in the minutes before his victory on wednesday , @entity56 pundit @entity55 ’s criticism that @entity4 ‘ had a little bit of a chip on his shoulder ’ prompted @entity62 200m runner @entity61 to spring to @entity4 ’s defence			1
@entity55 ‘ just slates our athletes ’ , @entity61 wrote on @entity64			2
‘ there ’s being honest and being disrespectful			0
’ but @entity4 ’s performance demanded respect last night			1
his winning distance was 11cm down on his leading jump in @entity36 and 31cm less than the new @entity62 record he set earlier this year , but the manner of his victory was deeply impressive			2
quite the collection : @entity4 adds the @entity6 title to his olympic gold medal from @entity17 leading the charge : @entity4 won gold for @entity24 despite having his sleep disturbed in the athletes ' village @entity82 potential : @entity4 collects his medal flanked by the silver and bronze medallists , @entity87 , left , and @entity88 , right , both of @entity90 @entity4 really thrived on the crowd ’s warm reception in an arena where his great - grandfather , @entity94 , played football for @entity24 106 years ago			1
the 27 - year - old responded to @entity90 @entity87 taking the lead by jumping 8.20m in the third round , earning the right to parade around @entity101 with a @entity103 ’s cross			0
it was only the second time @entity105 has played in this stadium this week , following @entity108 ’s victory in the @entity110 / 44 discus			0
@entity24 needed another gold medal in track and field after winning five silvers on tuesday night and their @entity8 champion — the only one of the ‘ @entity14 ’ trio to compete in @entity23 — duly provided it			1
however , a heptathlete called @entity119 also won a medal as @entity4 triumphed			1
with @entity8 champion @entity122 missing these championships after giving birth to her son , @entity125 , earlier this month , it fell to @entity126 to continue @entity24 ’s proud tradition in the women ’s multi-sport event			0
the 26 - year - old won bronze and set a new personal best of 5,826 points			0
@entity126 , who is trained by @entity134 ’s coach @entity133 , was third going into the final event , the 800m , and made sure she finished ahead of @entity137 to clinch the bronze medal behind champion @entity139 of @entity140			2
record - breaker : @entity142 strolled to victory in the 400m and set a new @entity6 fastest time there was disappointment , however , for @entity147 in the men ’s 400m final			2
the 27 - year - old seemed to go off too slowly , leaving himself far too much to do in the final straight as he finished fourth			0
@entity142 , 21 , added @entity153 ’s first @entity6 gold to his @entity8 title by beating @entity156 ’s 16 - year - old @entity33 record with a winning time of 44.24sec			0
@entity158 : day 7 review			0

@entity4 was part of ' @entity14 ' when he won gold at @entity17
he matched that achievement by *coasting* to victory in @entity23
he *comfortably* *qualified* for wednesday 's final with a jump of 8.05m
this was despite having his sleep *disrupted* by ' *ignorant* athletes '
@entity4 has overcome a ruptured hamstring that made him nearly quit
on tuesday his therapist @entity35 had to travel to @entity23 to treat him
