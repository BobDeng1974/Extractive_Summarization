@entity0 provides exclusive analysis for @entity2 in the wake of @entity5 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity6 in the table - topping @entity8 clash on saturday			1
@entity10 reverts to type i was watching @entity13 throughout the game and every time @entity5 went forward he was screaming at @entity15 and @entity16 : ‘ get back , get back ! ’ he brought on @entity17 and @entity18 and he clearly had decided that the one goal was all they would get			1
and as such , it was a building block on the way to the title			2
@entity13 was typically animated on the touchline during @entity5 's draw with @entity6 to me they looked much more like the @entity5 of last season : solid but lacking the creativity in midfield they have had this season			1
that , of course , was because they were missing @entity35 as much as @entity36			1
i think @entity6 probably have the best squad and @entity5 have the best starting @entity38 in the @entity8			1
@entity13 has n’t shaken @entity6 off and his team looked tired and vulnerable to injury and suspensions			1
i still think @entity5 will win the title but there are signs to give @entity6 hope			1
@entity35 and @entity36 watch on from the stands of @entity47 on saturday will @entity6 rue their missed chance ? @entity6 were more solid than normal to start with , as though they were expecting a real contest			1
yet by the end there was only one team going for it			2
i ’ve played in those games where you gear yourself up , expecting a really hard game			0
and when it does n’t turn out that way , you can be kicking yourself			0
that ’s how i think @entity6 will feel			1
by the time they realised the game was there for the taking , it was too late and @entity5 were set in their defensive mode			1
i think they lacked a little bit of ambition to win the game			0
@entity70 may be left to rue @entity6 's missed opportunities against @entity5 there is still a long way to go and the important thing is that now they stay in touch with @entity5 until @entity77 — they ca n’t allow that gap to grow			1
but at the end of the season , they may look back at this one and rue their missed chances			1
the missing man might @entity86 have made the difference in those final 15 minutes ? i thought this was one of the best displays from @entity90 and @entity91			0
they were brilliant in stifling @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
apart from @entity93 ’s cross for the goal , we did n’t see anything of those three			0
but you just wonder if @entity86 , who is at the @entity101 with @entity102 , with his strong personality and his physical strength , might have driven them on at the end			0
big men win you big games			0
@entity6 midfielder @entity91 tackles @entity5 's @entity16 while team - mate @entity90 watches on when @entity110 went forward , @entity109 would pull into that left - hand channel			1
it was a really good tactic but every time he did , @entity6 did n’t have a runner who could burst through the middle			1
@entity86 would have relished that			0
if they had been really brave and brought him on earlier , it might have just given them that edge			0
is @entity122 the new partner for @entity124 ? @entity122 looks like a player @entity13 will trust in big games			0
he ’s only 20 years old but he ’s picked him against @entity128 and @entity6 , when they were facing quick attackers in @entity130 and @entity109			2
@entity13 obviously feels he needs that extra pace alongside @entity124 and in those two you have a perfect mix : the big strong organiser alongside the quicker , sharper man			0
@entity136 and @entity137 were exactly that and it ’s a classic defensive partnership			2
@entity122 rises above @entity6 midfielder @entity139 to win a header i watched him a lot at @entity143 last season and he ’s probably the quickest centre - back in the @entity8			1
he ’s raw at times and just needs to fine - tune his game			2
he probably will make mistakes but he looks to have won @entity13 over			0
@entity5 will kick on with @entity149 i ’m a massive fan of @entity149 and i think we ’re about to see an even better @entity5 side when he joins			2
saturday ’s tactics were dictated by the loss of @entity36 and @entity35			2
i think @entity13 has concluded he is short of players to come in and he is over-reliant on his first xi. that is why @entity156 could give them the decisive lift			0
@entity5 will kick on in their pursuit of the @entity8 title with the acquisition of @entity149 i first saw him playing for @entity162 a year ago and i could not believe his running power			1
you think @entity95 runs hard , but this lad is something else			0
he runs box to box and he ’s a typical @entity13 signing			0
he will double up and defend but will pop up in the box 30 seconds later			0
he will fit into the @entity5 philosophy			2
it ’s maybe a signing that will push them towards the title .			2
