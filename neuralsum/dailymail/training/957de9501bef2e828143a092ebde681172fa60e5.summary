by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 19:17 est , 25 august 2013 survivor : @entity1 , two , lost her fingers and a leg to meningitis b it is a devastating disease that can kill in hours and leaves victims with severe disabilities or brain damage			1
yet while the repercussions last a lifetime , meningitis can strike suddenly and without warning – as mother - of three @entity10 learnt to her terror			1
when her gorgeous daughter @entity1 fell ill , she could only watch helplessly as doctors fought to save her			1
tragically , @entity1 , now two , lost a leg and fingers and the family is still discovering the lasting impact of her illness			1
but last month @entity24 advisers refused to introduce a vaccine that could protect children such as @entity1 from meningitis b , the deadliest and most common form			1
each year it infects about 1,870 people – one in ten of whom will die			1
those who survive suffer side effects ranging from deafness and blindness to amputations			1
yet the @entity37 said the jab – licensed for use in infants by the @entity41 in january – was not cost - effective and should not be provided on the @entity24			1
@entity10 , 43 , is sharing her story to highlight just how important the vaccine is			1
‘ i would n’t wish on anyone the harrowing days and weeks we spent with @entity1 fighting the disease , ’ says the accountant , who lives in @entity45 with husband @entity46 , 44 , and their children			1
‘ we were told to prepare for the worst several times and thought we ’d lose her – so although the side effects were devastating , we ’re just so grateful she is still with us			1
@entity56 is an awful disease and i hate to think of other children suffering			2
’ @entity1 was just eight months old when she suddenly became ill. she had cold - like symptoms – a high temperature that paracetamol did n’t bring down and she was vomiting and refusing milk and food			2
@entity10 was staying with her parents in @entity65 with @entity1 and her sons @entity67 , now ten , and @entity68 , five			2
when @entity1 did n’t improve , she took her to a gp			2
‘ he suggested it was nothing more sinister than a viral throat infection , ’ @entity10 says			2
‘ i questioned him about the vomiting , which did n’t seem to tally with his diagnosis , but was told that was probably just because of the high temperature			2
’ but the next evening @entity1 ’s breathing became laboured , her skin turned grey and her eyes became ‘ spacey ’			2
if only : @entity1 , pictured at home with her mother @entity10 , 43 , and father @entity46 , 44 , could have been saved had the vaccine been provided for her ‘ my mum phoned her on - call doctor and held the phone by @entity1 ’s mouth so he could hear her breathing			1
then we were told to call 999 right away , ’ says @entity10			2
paramedics rushed @entity1 to @entity96 hospital , with @entity10 following behind the ambulance			2
‘ at one point the ambulance screeched to a halt and the driver ran round and into the back			2
i thought it was all over then – i still do n’t know what that paramedic did , but they got her into @entity107 alive			2
’ @entity10 waited in the parents ’ room with a nurse , ‘ utterly terrified and shaking uncontrollably ’ , then was taken to see @entity1 , finding her with countless lines going into her tiny body , half her head shaved and surrounded by an array of medical staff			2
@entity10 was told she had a severe bacterial infection , to get @entity46 to the hospital straight away – and prepare for the worst			2
‘ @entity46 did n’t know if he ’d see his daughter alive			0
i asked if she was going to die , and all they would say was that she was very , very poorly			0
i went into shock and started vomiting			0
’ the decision of the vaccine committee to reject the meningitis b jab is truly disappointing			1
we are lucky enough in the @entity125 to vaccinate our children against other forms of the disease , including meningitis @entity129 and pneumococcal meningitis , but meningitis b is still the @entity125 ’s leading cause of bacterial meningitis and the one doctors fear most : it can kill within 24 hours			1
of course the committee must weigh up the safety and the financial implications of the vaccination before allowing it to become part of the national immunisation schedule			0
but the safety has been verified as the vaccination now has a licence for use from the @entity145			0
and i question how the cost - effectiveness has been evaluated – it is difficult to put a price on saving a child ’s life or protecting them from lifelong disability			1
after the introduction of the meningitis c vaccination in 1999 , it is estimated that 9,000 cases of meningitis were prevented , as well as 1,000 deaths			1
how can these benefits be evaluated in terms of money ? the @entity125 has one of the highest rates of meningitis b , affecting 1,870 people a year			1
one in ten of those who become ill will die , and one in three of them will be left with a life - changing injury such as brain damage or limb loss			0
the impact of the disease is immense			0
so it is extremely frustrating to know there is a safe vaccine that we can not give our children			1
if it is made available , i will be first in the queue with my children			0
hours later , at 3am , the tell - tale meningitis rash finally appeared , as @entity1 was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit at @entity186 in @entity187			1
she had meningitis b , which accounts for about 90 per cent of cases			1
the meningococcus b microbe usually lives harmlessly at the back of noses and throats of one in ten people , mainly older children and adolescents			0
but for reasons not fully understood , it can invade the blood and brain , affect the lining of blood vessels , inflame the membranes round the brain and spinal cord , and overcome the immune system			0
@entity1 was severely affected ; on arrival at @entity186 a consultant said she was as ill as it was possible to be			0
‘ we went into intensive care and could hardly recognise her , ’ @entity10 says			0
‘ she was very swollen from all the fluids being pumped into her and had a ventilator mask on			0
my main memory is how noisy it was , all the machines beeping and whirring and so many staff coming and going			0
' i wanted to pick up my precious little girl and hold her tight , but i was too frightened to go near her			0
’ the next day the family was told that , while @entity1 was n’t deteriorating , a pulse could not be felt beneath her elbows or knees so she might lose all four limbs			0
‘ it was devastating , but we just wanted her to survive as we ’d thought we were going to lose her , ’ @entity10 says			0
‘ we were offered a blood - thinning drug that might reduce the chances of her losing her limbs but could result in a fatal bleed			0
we chose not to go for it			0
it ’s the kind of decision i never imagined taking as a parent			0
’ over the next few days @entity1 ’s condition slowly improved , but she had to lose her right leg from the knee down			1
the family assumed it would then be a gradual process of steady recovery , but learnt that that does n’t happen with meningitis			1
days later an infection in @entity1 ’s back needed emergency surgery , and four weeks on some of the fingers of her left hand had to be removed			1
finally , after seven harrowing weeks , @entity46 and @entity10 took @entity1 home			0
@entity10 says : ‘ we were as open and honest with the children as we could be			0
@entity46 and i have had counselling , as has @entity67 , and it will be available for all of us , including @entity1 , as she grows up			0
’ a team of plastic surgeons , physios and other medics are ready to help in future			0
they found out this year that @entity1 has profound hearing problems in one ear			0
‘ hearing her laugh and watching her take her first steps with her prosthetic leg , i just feel so incredibly lucky to have her with us , ’ says @entity10			1
‘ and to know there ’s little in life she wo n’t be able to do is beyond my wildest dreams			0
we just hope more parents know the warning signs of meningitis – and that the vaccine will one day be introduced for all children			1

@entity278 , two , lost a leg and several fingers to meningitis b
new vaccine licensed by @entity284 which could have saved her
however , the @entity24 has ruled the meningitis jab is not cost effective
