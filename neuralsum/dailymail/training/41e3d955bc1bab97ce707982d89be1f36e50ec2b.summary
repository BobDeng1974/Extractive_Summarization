health officials are investigating nine cases of muscle weakness or paralysis in @entity5 children and whether the culprit might be a virus causing severe respiratory illness across the country			1
the @entity10 on friday sent doctors an alert about the polio - like cases and said the germ — enterovirus 68 — was detected in four out of eight of the sick children who had a certain medical test			1
the status of the ninth case is unclear			1
the virus can cause paralysis but other germs can , too			2
health officials do n't know whether the virus caused any of the children 's arm and leg weaknesses or whether it 's just a germ they coincidentally picked up			1
this is all that happens for most people who catch an enterovirus , especially adults			0
children , especially with asthma , are more susceptible to catching a more severe form of the illness			2
at the beginning it 's almost impossible to tell the difference between enterovirus 68 and a common cold			1
if a child develops a rash , a fever , or has difficulty breathing , parents should seek medical attention as soon as possible			0
progression : some patients will develop a severe cough , have difficulty breathing and / or develop a rash			0
enterovirus 68 is sometimes also accompanied by a fever or wheezing			1
children accross the @entity79 have had to be put on life support because of the virus			0
beginning last month , a flood of sick children began to hit hospitals in @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87 — kids with trouble breathing , some needing oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine			2
many — but not all — had asthma before the infection			0

the @entity10 on friday sent doctors an alert about the polio - like cases and said the germ — enterovirus 68 — was detected in four out of eight of the sick children who had a certain medical test			1
the status of the ninth case is unclear			1
the nine children had fever and respiratory illness about two weeks before developing varying degrees of limb weakness			1
earlier this year , @entity120 researchers said they had identified polio - like illnesses in about 20 @entity124 children over about 18 months			0
two tested positive for enterovirus 68			2
@entity10 officials say it 's still not clear if the virus was a factor in those cases			1
the @entity10 has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country , and as of thursday reported 277 people in 40 states and the @entity43 with enterovirus 68			1
so far no deaths have been attributed to the virus , but 15 still are being investigated			1
avoid sharing objects such as utensils , cups , and bottles			0
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands afterwards			0
if tissue-less , cough or sneeze into your elbow or upper arm , not into your hands			0
keep your hands away from your eyes , nose and mouth to keep germs from entering your body			0
proper and consistent hand washing is one of the easiest ways to prevent the spread of flu			0
teach kids by example by showing them proper hand washing technique : @entity165 hands with water and apply an amount of soap recommended by the manufacturer to hands			0
rub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds , covering all surfaces of the hands and giving added attention to fingernails and surfaces where jewelry is worn			0
dry thoroughly with a disposable towel			0
use towel to turn off faucet			0
' that 's why we want more information , ' and for doctors to report similar cases , said the @entity10 's dr. @entity186			2
the cases occurred within the last two months			0
all nine children are being treated at @entity5 in @entity189 , and most are from the @entity31 area			2
a hospital spokeswoman said the patients ' families did n't want to talk to the media			0
the nine children had fever and respiratory illness about two weeks before developing varying degrees of limb weakness			1
none seems to have a weak immune system or other conditions that might predispose them to severe illness , but the cases are still being investigated , @entity186 said			2
investigators do n't think it 's polio — eight of the nine children are up to date on polio vaccinations			1
it 's not known whether the limb weakness or paralysis is temporary or will be long - lasting			1
the cases come amid an unusual wave of severe respiratory illness from enterovirus 68			1
the germ is not new — it was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before , including in @entity220 and @entity221 in 2009 and @entity222 in 2010			0
because it 's not routinely tested for , it 's possible the bug spread in previous years but was never distinguished from colds caused by other germs			0
this year , the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses			0
beginning last month , a flood of sick children began to hit hospitals in @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87 — kids with trouble breathing , some needing oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine			2
many — but not all — had asthma before the infection			0
bed ridden : 13 - year - old @entity241 is recovering at @entity242 for children at @entity244 in @entity31 earlier this month from what doctors suspect is enterovirus 68 sudden onset : will @entity241 , 13 , was at school one day earlier in the month , woke up not feeling well in the night and in the morning his mom found him unconscious on the couch and had to call 911 the @entity10 has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country , and as of thursday reported 277 people in 40 states and the @entity43 with enterovirus 68			1
so far no deaths have been attributed to the virus , but @entity186 said 15 still are being investigated			1
health officials know enterovirus can cause paralysis			1
published reports count at least two @entity79 children who were paralyzed and died and were found to have the virus in their spinal fluid			2
one was a @entity268 5 - year - old who died in 2008			0
details are scant on the second case , which happened many years earlier			0
earlier this year , @entity120 researchers said they had identified polio - like illnesses in about 20 @entity124 children over about 18 months			0
two tested positive for enterovirus 68			2
@entity10 officials say it 's still not clear if the virus was a factor in those cases			1
paralysis is a rare complication of enterovirus 68 infection , but with so many more cases of enterovirus being reported this year , it may not be surprising to see that problem , said dr. @entity286 , chief medical officer of the @entity5 @entity287			1
the @entity10 is asking doctors to report patients 21 or younger who developed limb weakness since august 1 and who have had an mri exam that showed abnormalities in the nerve tissue in the spinal cord			1
@entity186 said a test that showed the germ in a patient 's spinal fluid would be good evidence that the virus was causing paralysis			2
unfortunately , lab tests of spinal fluid often fail to identify bugs like enterovirus 68 , even if they 're present , she added			2
has asthma and the virus : @entity309 , of @entity31 , helps her son , @entity30 , 9 , as he coughs in his bed at the @entity5 where he was treated for the enterovirus 68 and released , but his asthma made the illness more difficult to fight			1

health officials are investigating nine cases of muscle weakness or paralysis in @entity5 children and whether the culprit might be enterovirus 68
the @entity10 *announced* that enterovirus 68 was found in four out of eight of the sick children paralyzed
the status of the ninth case is unclear
the nine children had fever and respiratory illness about two weeks before developing varying degrees of limb weakness
@entity337 has been confirmed in 40 out of 50 states and may be the culprit for children 's polio like symptoms
so far no deaths have been attributed to the virus , but 15 still are being investigated
