that would bring the pace of price increases in line with the national average and ease pressure on the @entity38 to step in to stop the market spiralling out of control			2
@entity41 , chief economist at @entity19 , said the market ‘ remains relatively robust ’ around the country			1
but he added : ‘ what we are really seeing is some of the very strong upward momentum starting to come off the housing market , as a lack of supply , higher prices , more prudent lending measures and some of the talk from the @entity38 are creating a level of caution among sellers and buyers			1
’ the @entity19 report says tough new lending rules introduced in the @entity59 in april are helping to take the heat out of the market			1

‘ domestically , the main potential threat lies in the housing market , ’ said mr @entity92 , who joined the central bank from @entity105 three years ago			2
‘ i say potential because , as yet , growth in mortgage debt remains low			0
’ but he added : ‘ the housing market is recovering			0
