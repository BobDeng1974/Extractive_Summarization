a bumper crop of new potatoes has left growers in @entity3 with a bumper problem – their spuds are too big for fussy @entity7 consumers			1
a combination of rain , sun and mild temperatures created perfect growing conditions			0
but as a result , many are larger than the ideal size of 2.5cm to 5cm – with some twice as big			1
supermarkets are refusing to buy them and frustrated farmers are having to give tons of cast - offs to charity or leave them rotting in the fields			1
waste : good growing conditions has meant this year 's crop of @entity26 have grown larger than usual			1
now , piles of the potatoes are going to waste , pictured , because supermarkets wo n't by the bigger spuds @entity32 , sales and distribution director at @entity35 potatoes , said his firm aims to produce potatoes no bigger than 50mm in diameter			1
he said any larger and customers gripe about having to slice them into pieces to cook them			0
he said : ' we ’re producing plenty of potatoes the right size but a good percentage have gone beyond that			1
' the quality is exceptional but sadly people do n’t want new potatoes the size of baking potatoes			2
' there is high wastage			0
some of it gets returned to fields and a small amount for dairy fodder			0
there is n’t a lot we can do with it			0
' mr @entity32 said the problem was being exacerbated by a huge surplus of potatoes across @entity65 and the rest of the @entity7 , which has also enjoyed perfect growing conditions			1
the massive crop is in stark contrast to last year , when snow , frost and rain caused major delays to the @entity26 season and led to 10,000 tonnes fewer being exported			2
the crop was still worth £ 30m to the island in exports last year , however , in spite of the @entity79 said : ' this has been the best growing season since 1997 , when they generated 58,000 tonnes of crop			0
crop : peak season for growing @entity26 , one field ready for harvest pictured , is in may - when 1,500 tonnes of the potatoes are exported ' it ’s been incredible and there has been nothing to stop the crop growing			1
' normally you ’d get frost or north - easterly winds or really wet or really dry weather , but we ’ve had a perfect growing season			2
this year has been the best growing year for the @entity26 since 1997 - when 58,000 tonnes of the potato were exported from the @entity99			1
this year , thanks to excellent growing conditions , the average potato plant has produced 10 to 12 potatoes - compared to four to six normally			2
producers do not like to sell potatoes of over 55mm in diameter to the supermarkets - as then customers are more likely to have to chop them up in order to cook them properly			2
the crop accounts for around 70 per cent of the island 's agricultural turnover - with 99 per cent of produce exported to the @entity7			1
up to 1,500 tonnes of potatoes are exported from @entity3 during peak season - which usually falls in may			2
' it has meant a bumper crop but unfortunately it has n’t just been confined to @entity3 - the whole of @entity65 has experienced the same and there are potatoes coming from every conceivable area			1
' @entity123 , director of sales and marketing at the @entity125 , said his firm is experiencing a similar problem , with his potatoes growing so large that up to 50 percent could be wasted			0
he said : ' last year each plant was producing between four and six potatoes but this year plants are producing between 10 and 12			0
' it ’s been a little bit of rain , little bit of warmth , no frost or harsh winds so the quality and availability has been fantastic			0
' this time last year , the crops were really hammered by weather conditions - we ’ve gone from chalk to cheese			0
' we have a lot of competition coming in from the markets and there are a huge amount of @entity153 potatoes also being offered			0
' @entity26 account for around 70 percent of @entity3 ’s annual agricultural turnover and 99 percent of the channel island ’s production is exported to the @entity7			1
the peak of the season is may , when up to 1,500 tonnes of @entity26 can be exported daily			0
the kidney - shaped spuds enjoys the same @entity162 designation of origin protection as @entity164 , @entity166 cheese and @entity168 sausages .			0

good weather has meant @entity26 have grown larger than normal
some are twice the ideal size of 2.5cm - 5cm , putting @entity7 buyers off
means piles of potatoes are being left in fields to rot and are going to waste
