by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 21 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:27 est , 21 november 2013 in 2017 , a rare planetary alignment will see @entity5 and @entity6 orbit as close as they possibly can to each other and a billionaire plans to take advantage of this by launching a manned mission to the red planet			1
@entity15 engineer @entity14 wants to launch a shuttle , manned by two astronauts , on an 800 million - mile journey to @entity5 space that could launch as early as christmas day 2017			1
the shuttle will then spend a total of 16 months travelling to within 100 miles of @entity5 before being flung back to @entity6			1
@entity15 billionaire @entity14 wants to launch a shuttle , with two astronauts on board , on an 800 - mile journey to @entity5 by 5 january 2018			1
the shuttle will then spend a total of 16 months travelling to within 100 miles of @entity5 before being flung back to @entity6 the orbits of @entity6 and @entity5 mean the planets approach each other every 26 months			1
in late 2017 , a rare planetary alignment will see @entity5 and @entity6 orbit as close as they possibly can to each other			1
this rare alignment happens only twice every 15 years			0
when the planets are as close as they can be , the amount of time the astronauts will need to spend in space as well as the amount of fuel needed , is at its lowest			1
this means the chances of the mission being successful and the shuttle arriving back safely is increased			1
if 73 - year - old @entity14 does n’t launch the shuttle in 2018 he ’ll have to wait until 2031 to try again			1
this rare alignment happens only twice every 15 years and if 73 - year - old @entity14 does n’t launch the shuttle between december 25th 2017 and january 5th 2018 , he will need to wait until 2031 to try again			2
when the planets are this close , the amount of time the astronauts will need to spend in space as well as the amount of fuel needed , is at its lowest			2
this means the chances of the mission being successful and the shuttle arriving back safely is increased			1
the planets are set to align again in 2021 , although wo n’t be as close to one another as they will be in 2018			2
if @entity14 was to try again then , the journey would take 80 days longer and require the shuttle to fly closer to the sun , adding radiation risks			2
@entity56 has previously said that the optimum time to launch a @entity5 mission would a ‘ few months ’ before @entity6 and @entity5 are closest together , a time astronomers call opposition			1
@entity14 announced his plans , dubbed @entity62 , during a hearing at the @entity65 subcommittee on space on wednesday			0
he said : ‘ it would be a voyage of around 800 million miles around the sun in 501 days			2
the orbits of @entity6 and @entity5 mean the planets approach each other every 26 months			1
in late 2017 , a rare planetary alignment will see the planets orbit as close as they possibly can to each other			2
at this distance the amount of time the shuttle will need to spend in space as well as the amount of fuel needed , is at its lowest ‘ no longer is a @entity5 flyby mission just one more theoretical idea			1
not in a matter of decades , but in a few years			0
’ the shuttle will be manned by one male and one female astronaut , both from @entity88 , although the names of the candidates have not been announced			0
@entity14 ’s mission will be financed from private donations , as well as support from government sources , and he is working with @entity56 ’s @entity95 and @entity96 , among others			0
@entity14 is an engineer who was born in @entity98 , @entity15 in 1940			0
in 1962 he graduated with a degree in @entity100 and @entity101 from @entity102			0
two years later he gained a masters in @entity104 from @entity105			0
@entity14 made his money through an investment management company he set up during the 1970s called @entity108			0
the companies assets are said to be worth around $ 71 billion			0
in 2001 , @entity14 spent nearly eight days in orbit as a crew member on board the @entity114 spacecraft @entity115 as it visited the @entity117			0
he is also a former scientist from the @entity118 in response to the @entity14 ’s plans , @entity56 spokesman @entity119 said : ‘ @entity62 ’s proposed schedule is a significant challenge due to life support systems , space radiation response , habitats and the human psychology of being in a small spacecraft for over 500 days			0
‘ the agency is willing to share technical and programmatic expertise with @entity62 but is unable to commit to sharing expenses with them			0
however , we remain open to further collaboration as their proposal and plans for a later mission develop			0

the mission will take place when @entity5 and @entity6 become aligned in 2018
this is when the planets are the closest they can possibly get to each other
shuttle will travel within 100 miles of @entity5 before being flung back to @entity6
the full mission will travel 800 miles and be in space for 16 months
