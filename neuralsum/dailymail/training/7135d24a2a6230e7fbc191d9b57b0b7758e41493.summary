@entity0 2 - 3 @entity1 : click here to read @entity4 's match report from @entity5 @entity6 may suggest otherwise , but things just are n't clicking for @entity8 in @entity9			1
the @entity1 striker looked off the pace again against @entity0 on sunday , missing an open goal and frustrating team - mates with his decision - making in the final third			1
@entity8 is still yet to hit the back of the net in his second spell in the @entity19 following his Â£ 16m move from @entity21 , and fans may run out of patience			1

' it 'll drop for the boy , ' @entity6 told reporters after the game at @entity5			1
' the most important thing to me is his work rate			0
he 's working really hard			2
it 'll drop for him			0
' putting in the effort for his team is not a characteristic familiar with @entity8 , who often shied away from challenges with opposing centre backs @entity57 and @entity59 during the win			2
in fact , the 24 - year - old has laid on just one assist in his @entity19 career to date - with two years at @entity64 included - while he is experiencing the second longest goal drought of his career ( 10 league games )			1
strikers struggle to hide behind such damning statistics , and @entity8 did anything but that with his second - half @entity71 @entity26 's shot was parried by goalkeeper @entity74 , leaving ' @entity8 ' with a simple task from eight yards out			2
however , the ball ballooned over the bar , much to the amusement of the home fans			0

' he 's seen as a direct replacement to @entity94 [ @entity94 ]			0
i 've said before , @entity94 is irreplaceable , a real world - class talent			0
' that 's not what 's being asked of @entity103			0
he 's a great boy , i 've enjoyed working with him			0
he wants to be better			0
he 's a completely different player to @entity104			0
' @entity94 was constantly the man getting @entity1 out of trouble , and would have been eager to make a mends had he been the one guilty of missing a gilt - edged opportunity			2
@entity8 barely celebrated when his side wrapped up the three points			0
' i can see already that the @entity1 fans really like me , although i know that maybe they are a little upset because i do n't score , ' @entity8 told @entity113 last week			1
he had better hope that time comes soon , or fans may not ' really like him ' for much longer			0
