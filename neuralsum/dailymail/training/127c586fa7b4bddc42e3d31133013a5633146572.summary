@entity0 will fly out to join his @entity2 team - mates in @entity3 on wednesday – after @entity5 chiefs omitted the defender from their @entity8 squad for fear of a @entity11 - style administration blunder			1
the @entity12 international had been sent - off in the 4 - 1 first leg defeat to the @entity16 champions in the last qualifying round and was suspended for the return at @entity19			1
but with @entity11 ’s 2 - 0 win wiped out for fielding a suspended player , @entity2 had been concerned that @entity0 ’s punishment had therefore not been served			1
the central defender was absent from the @entity2 party which left @entity49 airport for @entity28 on tuesday morning but a belated call to @entity52 headquarters in @entity53 has confirmed the defender is eligible to play			1
blaming ‘ communication problems ’ for the mix - up , coach @entity23 said : ‘ @entity57 did n’t travel today , he is coming tomorrow morning			1
‘ in the beginning there were some communication problems , if he was ready or not			2
we did n’t think he was ready because he got two matches but in the end it was one match			1
‘ so he is coming now and i am very happy because we need defenders			2
’ @entity23 admitted @entity2 are unlikely to secure the signature of @entity70 winger @entity69 in time for tonight ’s crucial tie			1
the champions were hoping a 12 - month loan deal could be done ahead of tuesday night ’s 11pm signing deadline but the former @entity76 boss said : ‘ it is going on but it does n’t seem like there is going to be anything today			2
it is hard to get the paperwork together			2
addressing the media : @entity2 manager @entity23 speaks to journalists at a press conference on tuesday taking their seats : @entity23 ( left ) and @entity85 arrive for the pre-match press conference in @entity3 ‘ i am not 100 per cent sure but i think it is going to be hard to have him ready for the game against @entity3			1
’ @entity23 has challenged his @entity2 side to prove they are more than @entity8 lucky losers			1
well beaten over two legs against @entity11 , an improbable reprieve has dovetailed with convincing league wins over @entity95 and @entity96			2
and the @entity97 told his side to show they deserve to stay in the @entity8			2
‘ i think everybody wants to prove that , ’ said @entity23			1
‘ they want to still be in the @entity8 and i think the players really want it			2
‘ i think against @entity11 there were a lot of players who wanted it too much			2
and i have to say there were a lot of new things going on which took their energy			0
‘ but we played a good game on saturday and they look good in training as well			0
‘ if we perform well we will get our results , if we do n’t then we will not reach the next stage			0
so the performance has to be much better than it was against @entity11			0
‘ if we come away from here with a good result then we ’ll have the crowd behind us at @entity5 for the next game and everyone knows how much that means			1
’ @entity69 ’s likely absence follows injuries to @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , denying @entity23 options in wide areas			1
but the @entity5 boss said of the impending arrival : ‘ he will be an important player to have in the squad as well because @entity128 ( @entity136 ) is out and we will need him			1
top team : @entity23 ( centre ) speak to the rest of the @entity2 management team , including @entity141 ( 2nd left ) @entity144 stretch : @entity2 defender @entity145 warms up ahead of the training session ‘ he can play both sides and can also play as a @entity148 in a 4 - 3 - 3			1
’ the recipient of 18 yellow cards and two reds while with @entity149 before he joined @entity153 , the 24 - year - old ’s temperament has been called into question			0
‘ i have n’t thought about that but i know @entity158 players , ’ added @entity23			1
‘ they adapt when they live in @entity161 – he is not coming straight from @entity158			0
‘ he played for a time in @entity162			1
‘ @entity158 players sometimes come from tough backgrounds			0
the first year or two in @entity161 can be difficult for them			0
’ @entity2 are also in the market for a striker but @entity23 said there is no panic over the likely failure to secure a £ 1.8million deal for @entity171 ’s @entity170			1
‘ we have been trying hard to sign one but i do n’t sign players if i ’m not sure about them			0
i have to be sure , ’ he insisted			0
‘ the worst thing is to sign a player now and find out later that he ’s not as good as we hoped			0
when you go into the last two weeks of the transfer window suddenly something very good can happen			0
‘ the biggest clubs with the biggest budgets are still not finished signing players			0
at the end they have to get rid of people			0
‘ so i will keep my money and make sure we spend it right			0
the last 14 days is the most important part of the window			0
i have a good feeling we are doing the right things			0
it feels right in my stomach			0

@entity0 will fly out to join his team mates on wednesday morning after being left behind in @entity49
the @entity5 club believed he was banned for the match in @entity28
@entity2 manager @entity23 does not expect @entity70 winger @entity69 to be signed in time for the match
