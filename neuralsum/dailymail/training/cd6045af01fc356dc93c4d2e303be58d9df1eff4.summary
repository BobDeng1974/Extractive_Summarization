prosecutor @entity67 told @entity68 : ‘ he had said he would come behind her , push her and kill her			0

’ last night the @entity73 said it had launched an investigation into the police handling of the case			0

@entity10 jumped off the bridge , but survived			2
judge @entity107 told him : ‘ you were deported from this country but you came back , in my judgment , to pursue your obsession of not accepting the end of the relationship			2
‘ when you came back you quickly came back to @entity52 and to where you knew she [ @entity86 ] was living			0
your obsessive knowledge about her routine meant that you knew where and when she would be going to work			0
‘ and you foreshadowed by what you had said to her that you would kill her in the way you eventually did			0
you had decided she would die because if you could n’t have her , she would n’t have a life of her own			0
’ the @entity121 said it would seek to deport @entity10 for a fourth time after he had served his sentence .			2
