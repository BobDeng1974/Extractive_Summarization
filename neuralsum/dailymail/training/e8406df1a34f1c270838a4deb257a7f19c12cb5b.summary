by @entity0 ' first what i do is get my tape measure and then i measure its circumference and get the weight of the product			2
' people like to know whether its rigid , flexible or floppy and if it has balls as well			2
' explaining the secret of writing product descriptions for dildos , editorial assistant @entity10 plonks a plastic member onto a set of scales			0
it might sound bizarre but for @entity19 , and the rest of the 130 strong workforce at @entity22 , @entity23 's biggest sex toy retailer , this is business as usual			1
from dealing with queries on butt plugs to dispensing advice on how to escape from a chastity belt and sending out more than 3,000 orders a day , the staff at the company certainly have their hands full			1
now a new fly - on - the - wall series are to go behind the scenes at @entity22 , shedding light on the goings on at the @entity29 - based retailer , whether developing new toys or fielding queries from customers			1
the business was founded in 2002 by a pair of former technology journalists , @entity51 and @entity52 who identified a gap in the market for non-seedy sex toys for women , long before @entity57 made whips and nipple clamps a regular part of the nation 's sex life			1
after an initial £ 9000 investment , the company is now worth £ 30m			1
' all of the websites were presented in a really pornographic way and it was people coming from the porn world into the sex toy world and trying to sell products that way online , ' explains @entity51 of his eureka moment			1
business brains : @entity52 ( left ) and @entity51 ( right ) founded the company in 2002 returns : @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 ( right ) handle returned products with the help of some rubber gloves ' we came at it from a totally different way - we 're both internet nerds and it 's a female - friendly website			1
' now he 's hoping that sales will get another boost in the shape of the upcoming @entity91 film , and hopes to cash in via the company 's official 50 shades range			2
' it was such a blindingly obvious thing to do , ' explains @entity52			1
' there 's this massive best - selling book with loads of sex toys in it and obviously , it has got to be good to get the license to do sex toys based on the book			1
' having approached author @entity57 for approval , @entity22 launched its 50 shades range , which includes a spanking paddle , riding crop and love balls , in 2012 and recouped the initial investment within four months of the launch			1
now , with filming for @entity91 : the movie well under way , the pair are excited about the retail possibilities and have sent a selection of products to director @entity116 in the hopes they 'll feature in the film			2
50 shades of @entity121 : will ' mr @entity123 ' aka @entity122 find himself wielding the ' @entity125 ' riding crop ? official : @entity22 produces the @entity127 @entity57 approved @entity91 intimate accessories range ' we 've sent a 36 " bamboo cane , a red @entity132 crystal nipple clamp and ostrich feather tickler [ among other things ] , ' explains @entity51			1
' it 's a once in a lifetime opportunity			0
' if they 're used , however , it wo n't be the first time that a @entity22 product has enjoyed a moment in the spotlight			2
' we had one of our 50 shades products , the @entity125 riding crop , in a @entity148 video , ' adds a gleeful @entity51			1
' it was for her smash hit song , @entity153 , he adds : ' @entity148 can obviously recognise quality when she sees it			0
' although @entity51 and @entity52 take centre stage , the new series looks set to make stars of the rest of the @entity22 staff as well			1
along with editorial assistant @entity161 , later seen gamely packaging up a buzzing ' sex machine ' to send to an eager reviewer , there 's sweet former bank worker @entity164 who spends her days fielding inquiries about the correct way to use vibrating eggs , and @entity76 , doyenne of the returns department			2
staff treats : @entity22 staffer @entity172 rummages through the company 's very popular staff box donning rubber gloves as she unpacks an eye - opening selection of returned items , @entity76 specialises in reading out the complaints , many of which are hilariously funny , straight - faced before offering a sympathetic quip to colleagues , @entity184 and @entity185			1
' this is @entity187 , one of our big boys , ' she explains , a giant 12 " dildo drooping gently in her hand			0
' it turned out to be too large so they sent it back			0
whatever floats your boat i suppose			0
' @entity199 from the accompanying note , she adds : ' sorry to have to sent this item back - he is too big for a 4ft 10 " girl			2
if you could send me a six inch , that would be fine			0
' ' she probably took one look at it and crossed her legs ! ' laughs @entity76			0
elsewhere in the company , @entity22 staff are seen doing everything from compiling product reviews to giving their opinions on quirky items that range from the ' armadildo ' , an armadillo shaped member , to the ' winter willy warmer ' and @entity52 's latest invention , the vibrating finger			1
unusual decor : a set of painful - looking nipple hang from the wall in @entity22 's staff department testing ! staffer @entity226 works , seemingly unbothered by @entity52 's prototype vibrating finger next to her ' right now this is basically a pumpkin carver with a couple of latex fingers stuck on the end , ' he chortles			1
' it 's really powerful ! ' working at @entity22 is clearly not for the faint - hearted , although all of the staff appear to love what they do - even if it does make telling their parents what they do tricky			1
' you never know how people are going to react when you tell them you 're running a sex toy business , ' says @entity51 , who only plucked up the courage to tell his mother about the business long after he established it			1
' i did n't know how she was going to react so i kept it quiet from her for a bit , ' he continues			0
' i remember when i was younger , at the age of about eight , calling my sister a dildo at the dinner table and my mum flew off the handle , she went absolutely mental ! ' she was like , " do you know what a dildo is ? do you know what that is ? " and i did n't so she said , " it 's a rubber penis ! " ' i remember thinking to myself , " why would anyone need a rubber penis ? " now , ' he adds , laughing , ' i know			0

each comes with a note explaining why it did n't make the grade			0
here are five of the funniest read out by @entity76 : on ' teddybabe ' love doll @entity271 : ' it was the wrong type you sent - this is the deluxe model instead of the smaller standard			2
i also think it looks ugly			0
' on a purple dildo : ' why am i returning this ? i bought it for my girlfriend and as soon as she opened it , she laughed at me , slapped me round the face with it and put it back in its packaging			0
she demands that i send it back			0
' on the @entity299 : ' this has been returned because my son is only 15 and his parents were not happy when this arrived in the post ! ' on the @entity22 snug plug : ' i am returning my items as i found with the @entity308 , it was slightly too small			2
