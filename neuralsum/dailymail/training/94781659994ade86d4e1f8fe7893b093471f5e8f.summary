by @entity0 life of a chalk stream by @entity3 , as the poet pondered : ‘ what is this life if full of care / we have no time to stand and stare			1
’ what indeed ? so hats off to conservationist @entity3 who stands and stares for much of his working life , frequently up to his bits in bogs and marshes , as he marvels at the beauty abounding in @entity18 ’s chalkstreams			2
@entity3 stares at the world of wetlands and swamps through the rose - tinted specs of a passionate nature lover			1
@entity3 writes about the joys of fishing , surrounded by @entity26 in the great @entity28 countryside that irritating cloud of pesky midges hovering over the water that you or i swat away appear to @entity3 as one of the world ’s wonders			1
for him each midge is a creature of beauty with its impressive mandible and translucent veined wings			2
those tussock clump thingies along the river bank that sprout thin razor - sharp blades that cut your ankles to shreds are , for @entity3 , precious refuges for insects and tiny mammals			1
shake a tussock and more than 60 species fall out			0
@entity53 , found mostly in @entity54 , are unique			1
they flow through chalk land , their water springing from natural reservoirs thousands of feet below ground			0
@entity3 is a leading chalkstream conservationist and much of his book describes such daunting chores such as scything , unblocking , replanting , de-clogging , grave - refreshing , oxygen checking and so forth			1
flowers and otters are two of many sources of inspiration for author and nature - lover @entity3 and talk about hazardous ! stinging wasps , hissing swans , tussocks ripping his hands , nasty chest - high nettles ... @entity3 braves them all			1
he describes rescuing an angry bat — bats carry the rabies virus , remember — from a fishing hook			0
the bat opens its snarling mouth , exposing a vicious jaw full of sharp incisors , and @entity3 grasps the hook with forceps and deftly twists it out in one move			2
then there ’s the oozing mud problem			0
@entity3 has learnt that the worst thing to do when crossing a boggy bit is to adopt a bold stride			2
do that and you ’ll fall face down into the slime			0
his tip is to shuffle forward until reaching ‘ firm bottom ’ ( oh , give me firm bottom any day of the week			0
) @entity3 enjoys fishing despite the pesky midges that hover over the water speaking of oozing mud , each step @entity3 takes releases a terrible pong — part methane , part rotting vegetation			1
all that @entity111 , fermenting and decaying , is exceedingly whiffy , as are the hawthorn hedges which ‘ emit the most awful stench like rotting corpses ’			0
the bane of chalkstream restorers are the invaders			0
there ’s the dread @entity119 plant , whose rampant growth kills all native plants			0
he yanks it up by the root			0
another invader , the @entity129 mink , arrived in 1930 having escaped from fur farms			0
this furry killing - machine is wiping out all our dear little mice , voles and moorhens			2
@entity3 sees magic in every river crawler , creeper , clinger and digger			1
as for eels , who knew that they make a weird slurping sound as they hoover up insects ? herons , otters , the mating rituals of sticklebacks , the @entity150 dance , the spawning habits of salmon , the skills of angling are all , for @entity3 , a source of inspiration and wonder			2
nature might be red in tooth and claw and occasionally whiffy but @entity3 ’s enthusiasm is so infectious that by the time you finish his book you have put tussock - shaking , hawthorn fly - stroking and eel - spotting at the very top of your @entity167 .			1

@entity3 takes a look at the world through the rose - tinted specs of a passionate nature lover
@entity53 , found mostly in @entity54 , are completely unique
@entity3 sees magic in every river crawler , creeper , clinger and digger
