by @entity0 young people too willingly surrender their privacy to @entity3 and @entity4 , a leading scientist warned yesterday			1
@entity6 , a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at @entity9 , said that older people were more cautious with their personal data			1
addressing the @entity12 , he said : ‘ i ’m 65 , i do n’t want to be targeted			0
i am very uncomfortable with it			0
it seems to me our privacy is gradually being violated and eroded without us noticing			0
young people seem happy to surrender their priivacy to companies like @entity3 the @entity4 website contains millions of pieces of information about people that they have willingly given ‘ i am part of the generation which all read 1984 – i think we are less happy about giving up our privacy			1
‘ but the younger generation are n’t really thinking about it			0
the services that @entity3 and @entity4 give us are so good that people are willing to trade off their privacy for them			1
’ he said @entity3 ’s recording of all our online activities meant it knew far too much about us			1
he added : ‘ at the moment it does n’t seem harmful			0
but because governments can get hold of this information , they can monitor you , things might change quite dramatically			2
’ @entity3 has invested billions of pounds buying up cutting - edge technologies which will increase their access to people ’s information			2
the internet giant recently paid £ 1.9billion for @entity47 , a firm which makes internet – connected heating systems , allowing people to control their thermostats from afar			0
supporters argue that having greater control over home applications – which may soon include fridges that automatically reorder when you run out of food and lighting systems that turn on when they sense your approach – can only benefit consumers			0
but connecting more things to the internet enables large firms to collect more and more @entity66 recent @entity3 purchase is @entity68 , a @entity70 artificial intelligence firm which specialises in quickly building up a profile of an individual based on their internet activity			2
professor @entity6 believes that young people should read 1984 by @entity76 ( left ) and then they will recognise the dangers of surrendering their privacy to big corporations			1
