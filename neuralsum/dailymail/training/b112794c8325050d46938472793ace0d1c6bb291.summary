by @entity0 for the @entity1 the two young @entity2 who lie first and second in the @entity4 race and who were overlooked for the @entity2 @entity7 team just happen to be tied for the lead following the opening round of the @entity10 on thursday			1
@entity11 and @entity12 both shot 66 while two of captain @entity15 ’s wild cards , @entity13 and @entity16 , lie tied 27th in the 29 man field after rounds of 74			2
sparing @entity15 a sleepless night might have been the fact a quarter of the team who will fly to @entity22 in ten days are all tied seventh or better			2
@entity23 hits from behind a tree on the 15th during the first round of the @entity10 leaders after round one : @entity12 -4 @entity11 -4 @entity28 -3 @entity29 -3 @entity30 -3 @entity31 -3 selected others : @entity33 -1 @entity34 -1 @entity35 -1 @entity23 -1 ever consistent @entity28 and @entity36 champion @entity29 both shot 67 while @entity37 and @entity39 native @entity38 finished with rounds of 68			1
as for @entity23 , who needs to win this event to claim the $ 10 million @entity43 bonus , he finished well for a 69 and then talked about the @entity45 backlash on wednesday night that left him aghast			1
there on social media , he was getting abused for purportedly saying that @entity49 and @entity50 are washed up , and their day had come and gone			2
which was , quite frankly , a travesty			2
asked a straightforward question at his press conference on wednesday about the absence of the pair from the @entity10 for the first time since 1992 , @entity23 gave a typically straightforward answer			1
‘ they ’re just getting older , ’ he responded			2
‘ @entity49 is 43 or whatever he is ( he is 44 ) and @entity50 is nearly 40			0
so they ’re getting into the last few holes of their careers			0
’ @entity23 hits a tee shot on the first hole during the first round of the @entity10 given @entity49 has been a pro for 23 years and @entity50 for 19 , it seemed a statement of the obvious , albeit a candid one			1
thank goodness @entity23 did not feel the need to backtrack on @entity45			1
he was just anxious to clear up any misconceptions			0
‘ got a question today about @entity50 and @entity49 , ’ he tweeted			0
‘ gave an honest answer , was very complimentary about the 2 best golfers of this generation …			0
golfers on average have a 20 - 25 year career , both into the back 9 of their careers …			1
do n’t think there is anything wrong with saying that			0
’ there is not , and thankfully his relationship with both the @entity2 superstars is more than strong enough to survive a ludicrous situation			1
‘ i know the guys well and believe me , i ’ve said a lot worse to @entity50 ’s face , ’ said @entity23 , smiling			1
after all the consistent golf @entity23 has played this season it was unusual to see him spray the ball with his driver for the first two - thirds of his round			1
‘ my timing was miles off , ’ he said , and perhaps in previous years it might have led to an outward half of 40 shots or so to take him out of the ball game			0
here he hung in well for a one under 34			0
@entity23 reacts after missing a putt on the second hole during first round of the @entity10 over the back nine his round was going nowhere until he rolled in a birdie putt at the 17th and then parred the last			1
‘ i ’m obviously not firing on all cylinders but i think i found something right at the end that will be helpful over the next three days , ’ he said			0
by his side , @entity15 was equally adventurous			0
he was three under for ten holes before an ugly double bogey at the 13th set him back			0
@entity15 responded brilliantly with three birdies in a row to take the lead on four under before dropping a shot at the last			2
emerging @entity2 @entity11 , whose recent play has been a revelation , underlined his talent once more , as did his playing partner @entity12			1
out in the final group , they were so good they never mustered a single bogey between them all day – and will get to partner each other again on friday			0
@entity11 bites the shaft of his putter after missing a birdie putt on the 18th @entity135 was one of the first on the course , and got off to the perfect start when he knocked in a 15ft birdie putt at the first			1
that , alas , was about as good as it got for the @entity143 as he carded five bogeys in an untidy opening round of 72			1
@entity146 blamed poor work on the greens for not making an emphatic opening statement			0
‘ i missed loads of short putts and you ca n’t do that given the position i am in regarding the @entity43			0
i felt like i squandered quite a few shots out there , ’ he said			0
meanwhile , the mystery of how on earth @entity13 managed to secure a wild card pick over @entity11 simply deepened with his poor round			2
@entity16 was a more understandable pick but it must be worrying for @entity15 that he ’s barely hit a good shot since he was selected			0
@entity165 @entity164 was another @entity22 - bound player who struggled with a 73 but @entity33 , the other @entity166 player in the field , finished strongly for a 69 .			1

two young @entity2 lead *tournament* and @entity4 race
@entity23 struggles with his driver but holds out for a one - under - par 69
@entity135 hits five bogies in a round of 72
