a @entity1 high school teacher employed a ' wheel of @entity4 ' game to punish her students - and is going back to work			2
@entity8 instructed her @entity10 students to launch @entity12 balls toward their peers in two different taped instances , @entity7 reported			1
' i was chewing gum in class , ' student @entity15 told the affiliate station of an incident caught on camera earlier this month			1
' she looked over and she told me to spin the wheel and that 's like a normal thing			2
' i clearly said that i did n't want to do this , and after that i found out that you can opt out with a lunch detention and when i said i do n't want to do this , she said " too bad " or something and i got pelted , ' @entity15 told the affiliate station			1
' i 'm gon na be honest , i 'm hoping she gets fired because it was beyond humiliating , ' @entity15 also said			1
other students have spoken out and offered different opinions			0
' i 've gotten " @entity53 " a couple times but never in the face or anything , ' @entity49 told @entity54			0
' i kinda think they 're overreacting a little bit			0
she probably should n't have done it , but i do n't know if it 's cause to fire her			2
' @entity61 also told the station ' everything on " the wheel " can be exchanged for a lunch detention so students are never forced to do anything			0
i do n't think this is anything near what it 's being made into			2
' punishment : a @entity12 ball is seen on the floor after the rubber toys were thrown at a student , whose identity has been protected teacher : though chemistry teacher @entity8 was on administrative leave , she is not being fired though @entity15 's mother @entity80 complained and @entity8 was on administrative leave , she is not being fired , @entity79 reported			1
high school principal @entity82 and superintendent @entity83 said in an october 16 letter to parents : ' as you may know , we â€™ve been working with a third - party investigator to review the details of a video that surfaced on social media last week			0
' ' the situation called to light an inappropriate classroom management technique used by a @entity10 teacher			1
it involved giving students the choice of spinning a " @entity33 " for low - level misconduct rather than getting lunch detention			1
' ' the consequences on the wheel included allowing other students in the classroom to throw a soft rubber " @entity12 " ball at the student			1
the videos circulating showed students throwing the ball at a student			1
' ' this is not a practice authorized or condoned by the @entity114 and it has been stopped			0
when the high school became aware of the details of how the controversial classroom management tool was being used , the prop was removed from the classroom			0
' the teacher was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation			1
' the letter also said that ' on wednesday , october 15th , the results of the investigation were provided to us			0
after interviews with students , school staff and the teacher , the investigator recommended that the teacher be re-instated to the classroom with appropriate safeguards in place to ensure an appropriate classroom environment			0
' the investigator concluded that the use of the wheel was inappropriate , but well - intentioned , and the teacher did not desire to embarrass , intimidate or harm any student			2
' ' however , poor judgment by any teacher is concerning and we plan to work with the teacher on more positive and productive classroom management skills going forward			0
