@entity12 's 18 - year stint as @entity41 district attorney came to an end in 2010 after it emerged that he had sent a barrage of racy text messages to a 25 - year - old woman a year earlier			1
the attorney , who was married at the time but is now divorced and has filed for bankruptcy , sent the messages to the woman , @entity50 , while he was prosecuting her ex-boyfriend			1
@entity12 , then 50 , called @entity52 - who later identified herself in interviews - a ' hot nymph ' and advertised himself as ' the prize ' with a $ 350,000 house and a six - figure salary			2
messages : @entity50 was stunned when she received the racy texts from the da he asked whether she was ' the kind of girl that likes secret contact with an older married elected @entity61 ' and told her he wanted her to be ' so hot ' and ' treat me so well that you 'd be the woman			1
@entity70 that good ? ' she went to police , who referred the case to the state @entity74			0
that agency found @entity12 had n't committed any crimes but told @entity12 he should step aside from the domestic abuse prosecution and self - report his conduct to the state office of lawyer regulation			1
@entity12 removed himself from the case , reported his behavior to the @entity81 and agreed to resign as chairman of the state @entity85			1

an @entity0 story on the case that september set off a firestorm of outrage			0
@entity12 resigned in october 2010 as then - gov. @entity93 began a little - used process to remove him from office			1
as the story emerged , more women came forward and accused him of making sexual remarks / one social worker said he made a comment about oral sex to her before she testified in court and later told her he wanted the case to end so he could go to @entity104 and have ' big - boobed ' women serve him drinks			1

the agency recommended the @entity18 suspend his license for six months			0
a referee found a four - month suspension would be more appropriate , noting @entity12 has never tried to justify his behavior , he was abusing prescription drugs and was seeking treatment for a sex addiction			1
the @entity18 agreed with the referee 's recommendation			0
' the recommended four - month suspension is deserved , ' the court wrote			2
' in short , whatever his qualities and accomplishments as a lawyer , attorney @entity12 proved himself during the period in question to be sanctionably sophomoric			2

@entity12 , who was married but is now divorced , sent a domestic abuse victim a series of racy texts in 2010 and she reported him
he was removed from office when the story emerged and more women accused him of sending them similar messages
the short suspension was given as the court noted that he was seeking treatment for sex addiction and taking prescription drugs at the time
