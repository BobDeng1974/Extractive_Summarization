emergency measures will be introduced to prevent the lights going out this winter			2
offices and factories will be offered compensation to undergo 1970s - style energy rationing and shut down for up to four hours a day to prevent households being plunged into darkness			1
in addition , owners of old power stations will be asked to switch them back on to meet the country ’s demands			1
@entity15 had not planned to use this option until next winter			1
but yesterday it revealed a series of fires and setbacks had knocked some of the @entity24 ’s biggest generators out of service			1
two nuclear power plants are also offline , and are unlikely to be running in time for the start of the colder weather			1
fires at coal stations in @entity31 in @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity34 , have put the sites out of action , while a gas station in @entity38 , @entity39 , has been closed since the summer			1
it has already warned that the gap between household demand for energy and the amount our power stations can supply is dangerously low			1
under the powers , businesses that sign up will be ‘ bribed ’ to shut down between 4pm and 8pm on any day between november and february			1
they will be paid a retainer during the four months , even if they are never called on to close early			0
if they do shut down , they will be paid above the market rate for electricity they do not use			2
the second measure , which has never before been used in @entity24 , would see the resurrection of power stations that have been closed but not yet dismantled			1
@entity15 yesterday contacted the owners of recently closed plants to see if they could be running in time for winter			1
the majority of these are gas stations , though it is believed some coal or oil plants could also be asked to take part			2
1970 ... the new prime minister @entity73 ( left ) with @entity74 , the @entity75 , and @entity76 , the lord chancellor , in the garden of 10 @entity78			0
before his administration was over , @entity24 would be members of the @entity81 and facing a three - day week plant owners would be paid the costs of resurrecting their stations – which could run into tens of millions of pounds			1
once running , they would be required to be available between 6am and 8pm between november and february			2
they will also be paid more than the market rate for their electricity by @entity15 , which said yesterday that both measures would be used only as a ‘ last resort ’			1
@entity24 under @entity73 was a very different place to the @entity24 of today			2
on january 1 , 1974 , due to industrial action by coal miners and the 1973 oil crisis , mr @entity73 introduced the @entity95 whereby commercial users of electricity were limited to three specified consecutive days ' consumption each week			0
services deemed essential ( e.g. hospitals , supermarkets and newspapers ) were exempt			0
homeowners faced a three - hour on , three - hour off electricity supply and television stations ( @entity103 1 , @entity103 2 and the various @entity106 regions ) went off air at 10.30pm to conserve electricity			2
during the @entity95 , mr @entity73 called a general election running under the slogan ‘ @entity111 ? ’			0
it turned out not to be him and @entity114 ’s @entity113 was returned to @entity115			0
the normal working week was restored on 8 march , but other restrictions on the use of electricity remained in force			0
@entity15 , which has a budget of £ 800million to control supply and demand within the power network , added that the measures would add only £ 1 to household bills			1
energy analyst @entity126 , of @entity128 bank , said the measures were ‘ unprecedented ’			0
he added : ‘ it would cost quite a bit			0
you would need to get a lot of staff back on site , and would need out carry out trials before you can get it up and running			0
it could run into tens of millions , depending how many stations you needed to bring back			0
’ with @entity24 ’s economy on the mend , demand for energy is set to increase as manufacturing grows and businesses expand			1
factory output has risen steadily in the past year , and manufacturing growth in 2014 is expected to be the fastest since 2010			0
analyst @entity148 at @entity149 said the past three winters had seen almost all of the @entity24 ’s power stations running smoothly , which had lulled regulators and ministers into a false sense of security			1
he added : ‘ the government has been crossing its fingers and hoping that it ’s all fine			0
it ’s blindingly obvious that if you have a tight market then you will be more vulnerable to shocks			0
’ an @entity43 spokesman said : ‘ we are confident that @entity15 has the right levers to keep the lights on			2
‘ however , no electricity system anywhere in the world can give a 100 per cent guarantee that the lights will stay on			0
’ ‘ it would cost quite a bit			0

businesses will be offered compensation to shut down for four hours a day
@entity15 had planned to introduce this measure in winter of 2015
fires and other setbacks put some of @entity24 ’s biggest generators out of service
two nuclear power plants are offline and unlikely to be running in time for start of colder weather
