by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 03:50 est , 31 august 2012 a tiny fragment of finger bone has enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the @entity5 , a little - known ancient cousin of modern humans			1
evidence suggests that the @entity5 , who lived in @entity9 around 50,000 years ago , had dark skin , brown hair and brown eyes			1
previous research has suggested they co-existed with @entity14 and interbred with our own species , homo sapiens			1
the tiny fragment of finger bone has enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the @entity5 , a little - known ancient cousin of modern humans the researchers compared the @entity5 genome with genomes of several modern humans from around the world			1
the @entity5 share more genes with populations from the islands of southeastern @entity30 , including @entity31 and @entity32 , than with populations elsewhere in @entity30			2
analysis of the @entity5 genome further illuminates the relationships of @entity14 with individuals from @entity30 , @entity37 and @entity38			0
the existence of the @entity5 was only confirmed in 2010			0
scientists made the discovery after studying dna from a piece of finger bone and two molars found at @entity46 in the @entity47 of southern @entity9			1
today the same group reported results from full scale genome sequencing which produced a @entity5 genetic blueprint on a par with those obtained for modern humans			2
because they had only a tiny sample of material from the finger bone , @entity55 and his research team developed a treatment that unzipped the dna so that each of its two strands can be used to generate molecules for sequencing			0
this method allowed the team to generate an extremely thorough genome sequence ( @entity69 ) , similar in quality to what researchers can obtain for the modern human genome			0
the scientists found that the @entity5 were most genetically similar to @entity76 aborigines and island populations from south - east @entity30			2
the top of a molar from a @entity5 , a little - known ancient cousin of modern humans the molar that helped researchers piece together the genetic code of one of our ancient cousins , which existed in @entity9 50,000 years ago they listed about 100,000 changes in the human genetic code that occurred after @entity89 and @entity5 parted company on the path of evolution			1
they also show that the @entity5 individual whose genome was sequenced carried genetic variants that in present - day humans are associated with dark skin , brown hair and brown eyes , and that the genetic diversity of the @entity5 themselves was extremely low			1
given the @entity5 ’ wide geographic range over time , the team say it ’s likely that their population was initially quite small but grew quickly , without time for genetic diversity to increase the finger bone fragment , seen here next to a @entity111 cent , was the key in extracting dna and sequencing our closest relative for the first time ' this research will help determine how it was that modern human populations came to expand dramatically in size as well as cultural complexity while archaic humans eventually dwindled in numbers and became physically extinct , ' said lead scientist professor @entity55 , from the @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124			2
the entrance to the @entity127 cave in southern @entity9 where the discovery was made the cave was discovered high on a hillside in the @entity47 of southern @entity9 the research is published today in the journal @entity133			0
there are hints that both the @entity5 and @entity14 emerged from a single population that migrated out of @entity137			0
modern humans are believed to have left @entity137 to colonise other parts of the world hundreds of thousands of years later			0
in time , @entity89 inherited the @entity141 while the @entity14 and @entity5 became extinct			1
the researchers also found that people from eastern @entity30 and @entity37 possessed slightly more @entity14 genes than those from @entity38			0
this suggests that their ancient ancestors were more likely to have interbred with @entity14			0
researchers working inside the cave where the discovery was made			0
the area , in south @entity9 , is believe to be where the species was based 50,000 years ago because they had only a tiny sample of material from the finger bone , @entity55 and his research team developed a treatment that unzipped the dna so that each of its two strands can be used to generate molecules for sequencing computer simulations were also used to reconstruct the fingerbone			1

find enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the @entity5
lived in @entity9 around 50,000 years ago , had dark skin , brown hair and brown eyes
species is believed to have co-existed and interbred with @entity89
