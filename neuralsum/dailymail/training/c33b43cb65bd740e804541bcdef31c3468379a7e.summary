plans for a network of cycle pathways high above the streets of @entity4 have been unveiled by one of the world 's most prominent architects			1
@entity8 is a 135 - mile network of roads that would be constructed above existing suburban rail lines to create new cycle routes throughout the capital and has been developed by cycling enthusiast sir @entity14 , who designed @entity15 , known as ' @entity16 ' , and the new @entity17			1
the three - storey high routes would be accessed via ramps at more than 200 points			1
the first phase is a four mile stretch from east @entity4 to @entity23 would cost an estimated £ 220m			1
i want to ride my bicycle : the @entity8 , as proposed new network of cycle paths built above @entity4 's railways each of the 10 proposed routes can accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour and will improve journey times by up to 29 minutes , it is claimed the developers say almost six million people live within the catchment area of the proposed network , half of whom live and work within 10 minutes of an entrance			1
each of the 10 proposed routes can accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour and will improve journey times by up to 29 minutes , the developers added			1
they also claim the scheme , which would be built over 20 years , providing capacity at a much lower cost than building new roads and tunnels			0
@entity14 said : ' cycling is one of my great passions – particularly with a group of friends			2
and i believe that cities where you can walk or cycle , rather than drive , are more congenial places in which to live			0
three storeys high 10 mph - average cycle speed in @entity4 15 mph - estimated speed after @entity8 20 feet wide decks 20 years to build 29 minutes less journey time 135 miles over existing railway services 12,000 cyclists per hour 5.8 million people live close to proposed route £ 220 million to build first four - mile stretch ' to improve the quality of life for all in @entity4 and to encourage a new generation of cyclists , we have to make it safe			1
' however , the greatest barrier to segregating cars and cyclists is the physical constraint of @entity4 ’s streets , where space is already at a premium			1
' @entity8 is a lateral approach to finding space in a congested city			2
by using the corridors above the suburban railways , we could create a world - class network of safe , car - free cycle routes that are ideally located for commuters			0
' the developers - @entity88 and @entity89 - added that @entity4 ’s railway lines were originally built for steam trains and as a result follow contours that naturally reduce the amount of energy expended and avoid steep gradients , a boon for cyclists			1
@entity99 of @entity100 said : ' @entity8 is an urban cycling solution for @entity4			1
a cycling utopia , with no buses , no cars and no stress			0
' we are incredibly excited at how , together with @entity108 , our idea has been developed and now more recently turned into a truly world - changing scenario by @entity89 for revolutionising cycling in @entity4 and possibly the world			2
' however , cycling charity @entity112 has raised concerns over the wind exposure cyclist would face at such a height , and the steepness of the ramps required to reach the @entity8			2
cycling in @entity4 is on the rise as a result of increasing congestion and rising fuel costs			0

six cyclists died in a two week period that same month road safety in @entity4 recently came to the fore after six cyclists were killed on the capital 's roads in the space of under two weeks in november			1
@entity134 , 62 ; @entity135 , 69 , @entity136 , 43 , @entity137 , 24 , a 21 - year - old man from @entity138 and a man believed to be in his 60s all died between november 5 and 18			0
a spokesman for @entity141 said : ' we welcome the proposals which have been put forward by @entity108 and @entity88 and are always happy to look at ways we can contribute to improving travel and transport in @entity4			0
' we will continue to liaise with all involved as the aspiration for this innovative scheme develops			0
' over the last decade , cycling has grown by 70 per cent – on major roads the number of cyclists has increased by 173 per cent			0
however , this still only translates as two per cent of all journeys and falls short of many other @entity156 and @entity157 cities			0
road safety is a key factor : between 2006 and 2011 , the number of cycling casualties rose by half			0
cycling accounts for just two per cent of daily journeys , but 20 per cent of deaths and serious casualties on the roads			0
@entity4 ’s population is expected to grow by 12 per cent over the next decade , matching and then exceeding its previous high of 8.6million in 1939 .			2

' @entity8 ' is a proposal for a series of three - storey - high paths
it has been proposed by *renowned* architect sir @entity14
each of the 10 routes would be used by estimated 12,000 cyclists per hour
cyclist safety in @entity4 is a key concern following a spate of deaths
