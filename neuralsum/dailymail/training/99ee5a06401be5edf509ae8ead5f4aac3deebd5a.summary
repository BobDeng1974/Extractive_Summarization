in the eyes of @entity2 , change can not come quickly enough at @entity3			1
he feels the club he once served with distinction has reached an historic low both on and off the field			2
suffering through television coverage of last sunday ’s 2 - 0 @entity10 semi-final defeat to @entity11 — in which the @entity13 side failed to register a single shot on target — was a further reminder of just how far standards have fallen			1
the man who captained @entity3 to nine - in - a - row is a supporter of @entity20 and his move to oust the current board at an @entity23			1
and @entity2 believes the kind of investment in the playing squad being proposed by @entity20 and his allies is desperately needed			1
former @entity3 captain @entity2 is desperate for change at @entity13 ( @entity29 ) @entity2 , @entity30 , @entity20 and @entity31 speak about their views for @entity3 ' future @entity2 ( right ) captained @entity3 to nine successive @entity36 league titles between 1988 and 1997 ‘ i ’ve watched @entity3 since the late 1970s			1
i know about the teams before then from my father and grandfather , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ this team is probably the worst @entity3 team that ’s ever played for the club			1
‘ it ’s not their fault , it ’s just the circumstances at the club			2
it could also be the worst @entity11 team i ’ve ever seen , to be fair			1
that ’s the standard right now			0
‘ i remember speaking with @entity49 , when he took over the club in 1988			0
we were out one night and he mentioned something about “ his ” club			0
i told him it was never his club — it ’s the supporters ’ club			2
‘ i did n’t go to @entity61 on sunday			0
i did n’t want to			0
but what struck me from watching on tv was the @entity3 support			1
they were unbelievable , because they were watching a poor team being completely outplayed by @entity11			1
‘ but the @entity3 fans remained very vocal in their support			1
that saddened me in a way because i knew if that had been a team i ’d played in , which had been 2 - 0 down and getting played off the park by @entity11 , we would have got hammered			1
‘ but the supporters know that the current team just does n’t have the necessary quality			0
so i just hope @entity20 can get control at the @entity23 , because it will be better for those fans again			1
‘ loads of supporters have been asking me when is he going to get control			0
he has been trying to do something for the last few years but has just been blocked all the time			0
‘ everyone has — it happened to @entity82 , too			0
the worry now is that the current team might not even get into the @entity85 next season			0
i watch every game and it looks as if @entity88 will win the @entity89			0
it ’s not a given that @entity3 would get through a play - off against @entity92			1
@entity3 captain @entity93 ( right ) exits after a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity11 in the @entity95 @entity3 fans have not relented in their support despite the continuing problems @entity2 has described @entity3 current crop as ' the worst team to ever play for the club ' ‘ so we have to take it one step at a time			1
let ’s make sure @entity20 and the others get onto the board , get control of the club and then go from there			1
’ @entity20 has expressed supreme confidence about triumphing at the @entity23 , believing he already has more than 50 per cent of shareholders on his side			2
should he be proved wrong , then @entity2 ( right ) would despair			2
‘ we are bang in trouble if @entity20 does n’t win the day , ’ said the 52 - year - old			1
‘ i would fear for the club			0
in a lot of ways , it is the last chance to save it			0
‘ when @entity20 asked me to back him a while back , i thought it was the right thing to do			2
it ’s pretty evident , with what has happened since then , that it is the right thing			0
‘ the club is in as bad a state as i ’ve ever seen it			0
i ’m not sure the supporters actually know how bad it is			0
i hear rumours all the time that there is now just one guy looking after the maintenance at @entity13			0
it ’s unrecognisable from what it was 10 years ago			0
’ asked if he saw a role for himself under any @entity20 regime , @entity2 replied : ‘ if @entity20 wanted me to do something , i would do it			1
’ a £ 10million loan from @entity138 owner @entity137 is currently sustaining @entity3 , who this week also received five players on loan from the @entity143 reserves until the end of the season			1
rangers are currently being sustained by a £ 10million loan from @entity138 owner @entity137 caretaker manager @entity148 claim he must play all five @entity138 players being loaned to the club @entity138 's ( @entity151 ) @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 at @entity155 after arriving on loan caretaker boss @entity148 claims he has been told to play them and @entity2 questions whether their arrival will upset things further with a squad toiling for progress			1
‘ i put myself back into when i was playing , when i was captain , ’ he added			2
‘ how would i feel if i were @entity93 and you suddenly get a job lot of guys coming into your dressing room ? ‘ ok , if you are bringing in @entity169 and @entity170 to help you , fine			0
i hope they come in and do well for the club ’s sake , but i also hear the rumours some of them are injured at the moment			0
‘ @entity148 obviously does n’t want to be there , he has handed in his notice as @entity179 ( @entity180 ) did			2
‘ so @entity148 is there against his will , although he ’ll keep working under the terms of his contract			2
‘ but the five players coming in are nothing to do with him			2
it ’s such a strange situation but i do n’t think anything which happens at the club will surprise anyone any more			0
