aviation experts today reassured travellers that the @entity2 is still one of the safest planes in the world despite a crash in the @entity7 which claimed 150 lives			1
as emergency crews worked to retrieve wreckage from the site near @entity13 , in @entity14 , theories continued to circulate about what caused @entity16 9525 to fall from the skies			1
there has been some speculation about the track record of the model which experts were quick to quash			0
@entity23 , safety director at aviation consultancy @entity24 , said : ' the a320 family has a very good safety record considering that there is a fleet of 6,000 aircraft out there			0
' we have had a couple of events recently but in general jetliners do n't crash during the cruise , ' said @entity23			0
@entity50 , an airline pilot and author of best - selling book @entity53 , allayed any fears the accident was purely down to the aircraft model			1
' the @entity2 is a very sophisticated and popular model , ' @entity50 told @entity58			1
' i am not seeing anything in this accident that encourages me to think it is specific to that model			0
all @entity2 models are designed similarly , and the @entity2 is the blueprint for other variations such as the @entity2 and the @entity66			1
' i do n't like the idea of blaming these accidents on specific models ; this question is asked all the time , and all it does it leads to aircraft being compared with other aircraft			2
' crashes are so rare , and so comparing them considering the type of model is statistically hair - splitting			0
' what you will also see is there is lots of discussion , and sadly lots of misunderstanding concerning how computers and how pilots ' fly ' the plane			0
' usually in these cases , there is n't a single case , and it is a chain of events that can lead to something like this happening			0
' wreckage and debris lie on the mountain slopes after the crash of the @entity16 @entity2 according to separate surveys published last year by manufacturers @entity2 and @entity99 , only 10 to 12 per cent of fatal accidents take place when the aircraft is at cruise height			1
the @entity2 is described as a ' workhorse ' of the aerospace industry , transporting more than a million people a day from business travellers to backpackers			2
the 150 - seat medium - haul jet is one of the world 's most intensively used , together with its main rival , the @entity99			1
the @entity16 aircraft that crashed in the @entity7 yesterday , killing all 150 people on board , was also flying on the industry 's most widely - sold engines , made by @entity14 - @entity119 venture cfm			1
more than 3,600 of the jets are in operation and another 3,700 are waiting to be built as @entity124 's economic expansion fuels record demand			1
put together with the rest of the @entity2 family of twin - engine , single - aisle jets - the @entity129 , @entity2 and @entity66 - more than 6,000 are in use several times a day			2
experts say its safety record is among the industry 's highest , but it made grim headlines in december when an @entity2 belonging to @entity44 plummeted into the @entity136 , killing all 162 people on board			1
the crash is still being investigated			0
the @entity2 has been described as the ' workhorse ' of the aviation industry ( file photo ) to airlines , the main value of the Â£ 65million ( $ 97million ) jet is reliability and quick turnarounds , the features it shares with the rival 737			1
but it made dramatic headlines in 2009 when a @entity154 jet ditched safely in the @entity155 after a bird strike			0
@entity99 statistics for its rival 's best - selling model show that up to the end of 2013 , there were 0.14 fatal @entity2 accidents per million departures where the plane was destroyed or written off			1
the comparable versions of @entity99 had a rate of 0.11 per million departures , making them both among the industry 's safest models compared with the industry average of 0.76 , or more than 4.6 for the earliest days of the jet age			2
a helicopter of the @entity14 civil security services flies near @entity175 , south - eastern @entity14 near the crash site at 24 years old , however , the @entity2 that crashed was at the upper end of the service life used by many first - tier airlines			1
jetliners are built to fly safely for considerably longer but most major airlines sell them sooner for economic reasons			0
@entity50 added : ' planes are built to last many years , so long as they are maintained in accordance with regulations , this should n't be an issue			2
' there are airline specific procedures as planes age , and obviously the older they get the stricter the checks will get			0
' @entity194 , partner in @entity196 law firm @entity195 , added : ' there are many airliners out there older than this that are flying safely			0
' @entity16 parent @entity202 recently placed orders for over 100 new @entity205			2
to ordinary passengers , the @entity2 looks much like other jets			2
but in the cockpit it represented a revolution when it began service in 1988 as the first ' fly - by - wire ' jetliner relying on computers to fly within safe limits and replacing the usual control yoke with a side - stick , inspired by the f - 16 fighter			0
the increased reliance on computers , though increasingly common across the industry , prompted a bitter debate between @entity2 and pilot unions over whether too much control was being taken out of human hands			1
the argument rumbles on to this day .			0

the @entity2 is one of world 's most intensively used aircraft
more than 3,600 are in operation and another 3,700 are waiting to be built
@entity16 jet that crashed into @entity14 @entity233 was 24 years old
airline pilot tells @entity58 that nothing about the disaster leads him to believe it was down to type of plane
