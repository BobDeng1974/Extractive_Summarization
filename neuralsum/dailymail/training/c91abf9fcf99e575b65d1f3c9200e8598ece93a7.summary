he is the high - flying brain surgeon whose frank memoir moved @entity3 to tears over @entity5			1
but @entity6 , author of @entity7 , has returned the favour by accusing the prime minister of having ‘ c * * p ’ policy ideas and fomenting a ‘ permanent revolution ’ in the @entity10 that demoralises staff			1
mr @entity6 warns that the @entity10 ‘ is seriously running out of money ’ and says : ‘ most politicians now , particularly @entity3			1
have n’t got a burning vision			1
’ mr @entity3 told @entity17 this month that mr @entity6 ’s book had dominated his reading over the festive period			1
‘ he writes about some of his own cases , some that went right and some that went wrong			2
and you are moved to tears by reading this book , ’ he said			1
leading brain surgeon @entity6 ( pictured ) has accused the prime minister of fomenting a ' permanent revolution ' in the @entity10 which is demoralising staff the prime minister told friends he was particularly affected by mr @entity6 ’s story of a pregnant mother who feared she would never see her baby because of a brain tumour , but the surgeon managed to remove the tumour just before she gave birth			1
now mr @entity6 has responded by arguing that the government has mishandled the @entity43			1
in today ’s @entity17 ( below ) , he sets out a three - point plan to restore public confidence : admit honestly that queues will continue to lengthen unless the government pays more for the @entity10 ; scrap the target of treating 95 per cent of @entity49 patients in four hours ; and bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations			1
‘ politicians ought to stand up and say , “ i ’m sorry , but unless you agree to pay higher taxes , you are going to have to put up with longer queues ” , ’ he writes			2
‘ the first few hours [ of the day ] are often shambolic , spent finding beds for emergency cases			2
many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment , as “ their ” beds are filled by emergencies			2
this has led to a sense of demoralising chaos			1
’ the surgeon opens do no harm by saying : ‘ i often have to cut into the brain and it is something i hate doing			1
’ in today ’s @entity69 , he attacks mr @entity3 for pledging to make ‘ zero harm a reality in our @entity10 ’ in response to the @entity75 scandal			1
‘ another grouse i have against the present government is this zero harm c * * p. there ’s never going to be zero harm			2
nothing is perfect , ’ he says , adding : ‘ most politicians now , particularly @entity3 , are not really ideological			1
they have n’t got a burning vision			1
this constant permanent cultural revolution in the @entity10 is very demoralising			1
’ mr @entity6 is brutally honest about his own mistakes in @entity87			1
he recalls a 15 - hour operation in which he tore an artery , leaving his patient in a vegetative state			2
in total politics , he says politicians would benefit from equal frankness			2
‘ you know from bitter experience that			2
bad results are inevitable , ’ he adds			2
it ’s time for a dose of honesty if you want shorter queues you have to pay , writes leading brain surgeon @entity6 @entity3 's @entity10 reforms have been ' chaotic ' , brain surgeon @entity6 says by @entity6 i can not but feel flattered that the prime minister read my memoir of life as an @entity10 neurosurgeon over @entity5 , as revealed by @entity17			1
i am told he was very moved by it			1
but i wonder whether he skipped the passages about political meddling , the constant lack of beds , and this government ’s and its predecessor ’s chaotic reforms			2
because now , as the @entity10 struggles through yet another winter crisis , what politicians need more than ever is a good dose of honesty			1
rather than exchanging brickbats over the latest weekly @entity49 figures , they should take a step back , think about what ’s really gone wrong , and be straight with the public			2
they have been talking a lot of late about the need for transparency in the @entity10 – is it too much to ask the same from them ? so , after a 36 - year career in the @entity10 that has seen five prime ministers and 15 @entity139 , here ’s my advice for the current pm			1
first , come clean and tell voters that queues will get longer unless they are prepared to pay more for the @entity10			1
second , have the courage to scrap targets – including the sacred cow of treating 95 per cent of @entity49 patients in four hours			2
third , bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations			2
why say these heretical things ? the fact we have queues in the @entity10 is a simple fact of economic law			1
it ’s about supply and demand			0
the @entity10 is free at the point of delivery – as in my opinion it should be – which means demand is high			1
but it is in scarce supply			0
there are never enough doctors and nurses , in other words			0
because there is no charge for @entity10 treatment – and do n’t get me wrong , i do not think there should be – we end up with queues			1
as our population gets bigger and we age as a nation , demand for healthcare is growing			0
so politicians ought to stand up and say , ‘ i ’m sorry , but unless you agree to pay higher taxes , you will have to put up with longer queues , particularly for non-urgent treatment			0
’ i hope mr @entity3 – who like me has a @entity184 in @entity185 from @entity186 – understands this			1
@entity188 brought in targets in an effort to keep queues for pre-planned operations down by fining hospitals that failed to treat patients in 18 weeks			0
but this was a bad idea , verging on dishonest , since it implied the problem was just a question of getting staff to work ‘ more efficiently ’			2
yet the @entity10 has been underfunded relative to other developed countries for decades , and many of these other countries – such as @entity203 – are themselves now encountering similar issues			1
introducing targets is like trying to square the circle of supply and demand – an impossibility if the @entity10 is working flat out , as it is			1
mr @entity6 ( pictured ) believes the @entity10 has been underfunded relative to other developed countries for decades this might all sound rather theoretical			1
but targets have very real , unintended consequences in hospitals			0
for instance , because managers are always trying to hit targets for pre-planned operations , the beds are always full			0
this causes endless problems , especially when we have a run of emergency cases			0
when i go to work each morning i never know whether i will be able to get anything done , and the first few hours are often shambolic , spent finding beds for emergency cases			0
many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment , as ‘ their ’ beds are filled by emergencies			0
it ’s like a game of musical chairs , which gets faster and faster with each year , with the government constantly changing the music but not adding beds to keep up with the growing number who need them			0
mr @entity6 's memoir ( pictured ) was said to have moved prime minister @entity3 to tears this has led to a sense of demoralising chaos , a feeling that i know is shared by an awful lot of people working in hospitals			1
in the past , we had long waiting lists for routine surgery			0
of course , this was n’t perfect , but at least it was honest			0
and it meant doctors could more easily give priority to the emergency cases , as we have to			0
it ’s not just targets for routine operations that have a lot to answer for			0
there has been a huge fuss in the press over hospitals missing the target of treating 95 per cent of @entity49 patients within four hours			0
but it ’s only gone from something like 96 per cent to just under 90 per cent			0
that ’s not bad for an emergency service			0
internationally , it ’s par for the course			0
but politicians insist on whacking each other over the head over a few percentage points			0
what truly matters is that the real emergencies – strokes , heart attacks , serious injuries and in my case brain tumours – are treated promptly			2
i think the four - hour target has got in the way of that			0
less well known is the target that limits how many people we admit as emergencies			0
if hospitals admit too many , they are penalised financially , which i find bizarre			0
are we supposed not to treat them ? i take an intense personal pride in looking after my patients			0
i did not like having a waiting list for routine cases , but i hate even more having to cancel these cases at the last minute – it ’s horrible for the patients			0
and it ’s alarmingly easy to start becoming like a bureaucrat myself , turning the patients away and saying : ‘ it ’s not my problem			0
’ so , as much as politicians do n’t want to say it and the public probably do n’t want to hear it , i think we need to abolish targets and reintroduce waiting lists for non-urgent surgery , if politicians feel it is impossible to put much more money into the @entity10			1
are they brave enough to admit this as the @entity326 looms ? it was not easy to write my book and admit i have made serious mistakes in my career			0
yet i have received hundreds – probably thousands – of messages thanking me for my honesty and saying that my admission of fallibility made readers trust me more , not less			0
is there perhaps a moral here for our politicians ?			0

brain surgeon @entity6 has *blasted* the @entity344 's handling of @entity10 *system*
his memoir was said to have moved mr @entity3 to tears when he read it
but he said the pm is fomenting a ' permanent revolution ' in the @entity10
this is ' demoralising ' staff and is *due* to mr @entity3 's lack of ' vision '
