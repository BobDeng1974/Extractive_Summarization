' from out of nowhere , they were next to me			0
my girlfriend said they kicked me when i was on the floor at least 30 times			2
' i ’m just glad it ’s all over now , it ’s been a long two years			0
they never showed any remorse , contrition or shame - it was a pack mentality			2
' the lads tried to claim that the damage they ’d done to me was from one punch , which is just ludicrous			0
if that ’s the case then they must be related to @entity42			0
' he was greeted at the door by @entity45 , 20 , @entity46 , 19 and @entity47 , 21 , who were visiting a friend			0
the three , all in their teens when the attack happened , then crept up on @entity0 as he returned to his house and furiously assaulted him , throwing him to the ground and kicking him in the head			1

mr @entity0 , a carpenter , had delivered a note the week before after the noise of a dog barking had kept him and @entity67 awake for weeks			1
he said : ' it still hurts like hell now , especially when it ’s cold			0
it ’s like someone pushing on my face all day			2
' i could never have imagined that going to their house could have ended up with something like this			0
' i ’d popped a note through their door a few weeks before as this dog was barking 12 hours , day and night - we could n’t sleep			1
' but when i went to the house and three men who did n’t live there answered the door , i suddenly felt pretty scared			0
but i asked could they please keep the noise down and then left			2
' i knew going round would n’t make much difference , but what happened next will stay with me for a good few years			0
jailed : @entity47 thug : @entity45 guilty : @entity46 ' next thing i knew i was on the ground , covered in blood			2
i did n’t think i was unconscious , but i must ’ve been knocked out			2
i staggered back to my house after people helped pick me up			0
' i ’m a big bloke and i played rugby for years , so i ’ve had my fair share of cuts and bruises			0
but they knocked me down and just kicked away from what i ’ve been told			2
' the surgeon was convinced that i was hit with something , a weapon or a ring or something - that ’s why there was so much blood			2
' my cheekbone and eye socket were compressed down into my face			1
my nosed had to be wired to my cheekbone there was so little left there and the four metal plates hold it together			1
' it was two weeks before the surgeons could even start on my face , but the job they did - i ’m so grateful			1
' partner @entity67 , a nanny , saw the whole attack and had to put aside her terror to help @entity0			1
@entity0 and @entity67 have been left traumatised by the horrific beating , which happened in their street ms @entity67 said : ' it was horrendous what i saw - i honestly thought @entity0 was going to die as they kicked away at him			1
' i still look at @entity0 and i ’m stunned that a human being can take that sort of beating			1
' when i grabbed one of them to try and make them stop , i thought he was going to go for me			0
but he went back and just kept on kicking away			0
' it ’s been a nightmare			0
i do n’t think it ’s all over and i hoped they would be out our lives for longer			0
' just from the sheer amount of blood that @entity0 was covered in , and lost , it covered our house			1
we had to redecorate our hall and throw out the sofa			0
' it ’s almost as if it still haunts us - it ’s like a horror film			2
i ’ve had counselling and thank @entity161 @entity0 has fully recovered			1
' but you ca n’t behave like this and get away with it - and it feels like that ’s happened a little bit			2
' people need to know that a punishment fits a crime			0
and i want them to see what they ’ve done			0
' mr @entity0 has been forced to take a lot of time off work since the assault			1
