@entity0 would introduce a new legal right to ‘ granny leave ’ to allow working grandparents to take time off to help care for their grandchildren			2
the party ’s deputy leader @entity9 , in an interview with the @entity8 , said grandparents would be allowed to take up to four unpaid weeks off per year in order to help with childcare			1
she said the policy , to be unveiled in @entity0 ’s women ’s manifesto , to be launched today , would require a change in the law and would help millions of working families			1
research suggests 1.9 million grandparents have given up a job , reduced their hours , or taken time off work to look after their grandchildren			2
but the proposed extension of workplace rights to millions more staff is likely to meet with a backlash from some business leaders , who will have to bear the costs of absences			1
they are already having to implement a new system of shared parental leave , which allows mothers and fathers to swap their time off after a new child			2
critics will argue businesses can not be expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy recovers from the recession			1
miss @entity9 insisted many businesses would welcome ‘ granny leave ’ , since it would be likely to keep more older women in the workplace – and also enable their children have a better work - life balance			1
she said she envisaged many grandparents using the new legal right to take time off over school summer holidays , when parents otherwise have to pay for expensive childcare			2
‘ in many families , grandparents play an integral part of caring for their grandchildren and for many people that ’s a financial necessity , ’ she said			1
‘ but many people are working longer and today ’s generation of grannies are working until they ’re 67			2
they do n’t want to have to choose between carrying on with their job and this role they regard as so important in their lives , which is their role with their grandchildren			2
‘ more and more daughters and daughters - in - law are in work , childcare is more expensive and grandmothers are now working			0
‘ instead of having to choose between retiring early and giving up work , or not being part of the daily care for their grandchildren , we ’re saying let ’s look at the leave arrangements to recognise what the pattern of family life			0
‘ this is the next frontier			0
it ’s the first time there has been a policy which recognises this role of grandparents			1
’ miss @entity9 says a @entity0 government would legislate to allow grandparents as well as parents , or those with legal responsibility , to access the leave currently , parents can claim 18 weeks unpaid parental leave - of up to four weeks in any given year - per child up to their fifth birthday , soon to be extended to their eighteenth birthday			1
miss @entity9 says a @entity0 government would legislate to allow grandparents as well as parents , or those with legal responsibility , to access the leave			1
employers would not have the right to turn down the requests for time off			0
@entity125 , chief executive of the charity grandparents plus , said : ‘ grandparents are the hidden army of carers in @entity130 today			0
' we know that one in five working parents – two million of them - would give up work without grandparents to rely on			0
but increasingly grandparents are working too			0
‘ so this policy is also a win for employers as it helps both parents and grandparents stay in work			1
’ other measures in today ’s manifesto will include doubling paid paternity leave from two to four weeks , and increasing the amount paid from just under £ 140 a week to £ 260 a week			0
the party also plans a controversial move to introduce ‘ compulsory ’ sex and relationship education in schools			0
@entity0 would change the law if it wins the election to force all state - funded schools , including primaries , to put sex education on the curriculum			0
labour sources say ‘ age appropriate ’ teaching about sex and relationships would begin in @entity160 , when children are aged five to seven			0
parents would retain the existing right to withdraw their children from lessons on the subject until the age of 15			0
the party will also pledge today to crack down further on domestic violence by appointing a new commissioner to direct policy to tackle abuse .			1
