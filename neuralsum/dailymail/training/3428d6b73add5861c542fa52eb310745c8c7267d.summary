@entity0 will take @entity1 into an alliance with a host of extreme right wing parties , one of the @entity7 's most controversial politicians has claimed			1
anti-eu @entity9 politician @entity8 said mr @entity0 will ditch a promise never to work with @entity12 's @entity11 - led by @entity13			1
mr @entity8 and miss @entity14 have joined forces to create a ' @entity17 '			2
like @entity1 , both are leading in the polls ahead of the crunch may 22 @entity22 elections			2
@entity24 's top far right politician @entity8 has formed a @entity26 - @entity9 alliance with @entity13 's @entity11 mr @entity0 has refused to join the alliance - and pledged never to work with the @entity12 nationalists because of their ' anti-semitism and general prejudice '			1
but mr @entity0 has refused to rule out working with mr @entity31 - despite the @entity9 politican ’s controversial views on @entity34 and immigrants , mr @entity8 , who leads the @entity36 , sparked controversy this year by joining in chants demanding ' fewer @entity39 ' at a campaign rally			1
but the @entity9 politician dismissed criticism of his behaviour - and insisted he could persuage mr @entity0 to work with miss @entity14 ’s @entity11			1
@entity13 has overseen a boom in popularity for @entity12 's controversial @entity46 after taking over from her father @entity47 he told @entity49 : ' i am optimistic that mr @entity0 will have more room to work together than he does today after the elections			1
' he is not excluding my party and there is still an opportunity but he is tougher on the @entity11 for now			2
' i understand he is a politician but i hope after elections both @entity56 , mr @entity0 and myself will be able to work together			2
' i respect mr @entity0 a lot			0
i think he is a very charismatic and excellent politician i understand he has a lot of support			0
' but i also respect @entity13 a lot			0
she is a very charismatic leader as well doing well in the polls with almost the same message when it comes to @entity24			0
' mr @entity8 said mr @entity0 would join the far - right alliance after the elections - where @entity69 parties are expected to get a third of the vote across the @entity72 - because it would hand the anti-eu parties much more power			1
he said : ' i hope we can overstep our differences to represent the all the millions of people who elected our parties to be as strong as possible a countervailing power against all the @entity80 in @entity81			0
' it is not helpful to have two leaders of two important parties [ mr @entity0 and miss @entity14 ] fighting publicly			2
i hope i can play a role in bringing them both together			0
i would like to work together very closely with @entity1 and @entity11			1
' polls put the @entity12 @entity11 and @entity36 in a strong position to form a far - right bloc in the @entity22			1
they are expected to end up with at least 38 meps from at least seven countries			0
the @entity100 , @entity94 @entity93 , @entity96 @entity95 , @entity97 and @entity99 @entity98 have all vowed to join the alliance			0
if the group does as well as the polls suggest , it would be entitled to over £ 2million a year in @entity7 funds			0
but they would be in an even better position if @entity1 's expected 25 @entity91 were to sign up as well			0
@entity13 ( right ) took over from her controversial father @entity108 ( left ) as @entity12 's top far right politician in 2011 mr @entity8 said : ' the elections are historic because many @entity69 parties , in the @entity113 , @entity9 and @entity12 , will have a very good result			1
' if they are not the outright winners they will be second in many cases			0
' people are fed up			0
we want to decide who we invite into our country , how we spend our money for @entity9 taxpayers , not to give it to @entity126 or @entity127			0
' we have to be masters again of our borders and budgets			0
” @entity0 shares a hatred for the @entity7 with other far - right @entity24 politicians - but insists he will not join a formal alliance because of the @entity11 's alleged anti antisemitism but @entity1 has insisted that there will no alliance with mr @entity8 and miss @entity14			1
@entity1 's @entity138 said on @entity139 today : ' memo to @entity8 : @entity1 @entity91 will absolutely not sit with @entity13 's party			1
' a party spokesman added : ' @entity1 has made it clear that the party will have nothing to do with @entity11 or any of its fellow travellers in their new group			1
' there have been no contacts between @entity0 and @entity8			2

@entity1 has ruled out working with @entity12 's controversial @entity11
@entity0 claims @entity13 's *anti-immigration* party is ' anti-semitic '
but she is on course to win *upcoming* @entity81 elections
@entity14 wants to form a *eurosceptic* bloc to *undermine* @entity81
@entity9 mp @entity8 says @entity1 will find a way to work with @entity14
