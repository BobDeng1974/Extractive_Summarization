@entity0 has opened the door to a third spell at @entity3 for @entity5 star @entity4			1
out of contract at @entity7 this summer , @entity4 was the subject of a failed £ 750,000 bid by @entity9 last week			1
manager @entity10 revealed , however , that ‘ four or five ’ clubs were interested in the former @entity13 attacker			1
@entity3 are interested in signing @entity5 and @entity7 forward @entity4 ( left ) the @entity7 attacker has spent two previous spells at @entity13 speaking from @entity3 ’s winter training camp in @entity18 , @entity0 admitted the @entity20 champions could be one of them			1
@entity23 to infuse his side with a hardcore of experienced , older @entity20 players , the @entity22 said of the @entity4 situation : ‘ i am aware of all the @entity20 players			1
he is a good player and is one we know about			1
he is at @entity7 at the moment but we will wait and see			1
‘ i have seen him many times			1
he is a quick , creative player and is a very good person with a great mentality			2
he looks like a @entity3 player			1
’ @entity7 are holding out for £ 1million in the current window			1
@entity0 has seen @entity4 excel in the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation he likes with @entity5 , however , and could make a move even if current playmaker @entity37 signs a new contract			1
@entity3 manager @entity39 is understood to be one of ' four or five clubs ' tracking @entity4 the hoops manager wants to introduce more homegrown players , like @entity44 ( centre ) , into his side ‘ i have always had six or seven older players in my team , ’ he continued			1
‘ you can have a lot of ( young ) talent but it is insecure without leaders and they wo n’t develop			2
that ’s why guys like @entity55 ( @entity44 ) are so important			2
’ commons ’ agent @entity56 has been invited to @entity13 for fresh talks aimed at breaking the stalemate surrounding his contract situation			2
@entity3 are blanking calls from @entity64 ’s @entity63 in the hope of working out a deal to keep commons – who is expected to fly to @entity18 after a family funeral			1
asked if the player will stay , @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s hard to say , only he can answer that			2
we are going to meet his agent next week when we get back			1
he is an important player and we want to keep him			2
’ also reluctant to lose £ 8m - rated defender @entity78 , the @entity3 boss remained confident of ending the transfer window with a stronger squad			1
@entity37 is yet to sign a new deal at @entity3 amid interest from former boss @entity64 at @entity63 @entity83 defender @entity78 ( right ) is on the radar of several clubs south of the border ‘ i am confident we will be stronger by february , ’ he said			1
‘ i speak regularly with @entity88 ( @entity89 ) and he has one goal - to keep every player we want to keep			2
it ’s vital the squad is stronger			2
this is not the time to lose players , we want to bring them in			0
’ having been linked with @entity102 trio @entity101 , @entity103 and @entity104 , @entity0 joked : ‘ i will buy the @entity102 team , and @entity106 as well			0
that ’s one way to do it , we could buy all of their strikers			0
but things are happening all the time			0
we are in a much better situation than we were in the summer			0
’ @entity0 has also been linked with a raft of his former players in @entity22 , but is wary of importing any more of his countrymen after the failed loan capture of @entity112			0
‘ i would choose to bring in @entity20 and @entity114 players , especially in this window as they need to be able to make a difference straight away , ’ he admitted			0
‘ @entity118 players know what the @entity20 game is all about			0
‘ if i was to bring in a @entity22 player they would have to be very strong			0
it ’s difficult to say if they are good enough so i would be anxious about bringing one in			0
@entity3 are wary of signing more @entity22 players after failed bid to land @entity127 ( 2nd right ) ‘ it ’s something we saw with @entity112			1
other managers have brought in @entity22 players who have been successful but it ’s safer to bring in home players			0
‘ i have been impressed with the technique of the @entity20 players , but also the attitude			0
they have a good mentality			0
it ’s difficult for teams made up of different nationalities			0
it ’s more individualistic in @entity5 whereas in @entity22 it ’s more systematic			0
if we can get a mixture of both then we can do very well			0
‘ we are not going to have the best players in @entity146 - but we can have the best team			0
that ’s what we are working on every day			0

@entity4 would be *welcomed* back for a third spell at @entity3
@entity7 forward was subject of a £ 750,000 bid from @entity9 last week
@entity37 future remains *uncertain* amid interest from @entity63
