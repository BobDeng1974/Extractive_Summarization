on september 2 , 2013 , when @entity1 was presented to more than 30,000 spectators inside the @entity3 , he stood before them , smiling awkwardly , desperately trying to recollect those @entity6 phrases he memorised			1
a few sentences in the local lingo – all in that recognisable @entity11 accent – and his romantic introduction to @entity6 football was official			0
‘ @entity15 , ’ he yelled , and a roar replied			0
yet the patience £ 86million buys you comes with an expiration date , it seems			0
the now infamous reaction of @entity21 when @entity1 failed to pass to him during @entity24 's @entity23 match against @entity25 at the @entity3 last month the pair in happier times , when @entity24 beat @entity28 en route to @entity31 glory in 2014 @entity21 celebrates with @entity1 after scoring a low free - kick to complete a 4 - 0 rout of @entity28 last season even winning the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 in less than 18 months does n’t make you immune to those @entity6 whistles			1
but they were there , loud enough to discern			0
the thing is , the @entity3 boo boys can be the harshest critics in football			0
maybe it ’s a rite of passage			0
@entity49 , a @entity24 legend in every sense of the word , was whistled on occasion			1
so , too , was @entity53			0
there was also @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , and , more recently , @entity59			0
even the great @entity49 ( right ) , seen here with @entity61 and the @entity35 in 1957 , was not immune to the @entity3 boo boys @entity53 , who helped @entity24 win their ninth @entity35 in 2002 , was also booed on occasion @entity1 in action for @entity24 during their midweek liga win over @entity65 , a result that kept them top of the table even @entity21 has been subject to it			1
@entity71 and booing let rip in the 76th minute against @entity72 on march 29 , 2014 – when @entity24 were already 4 - 0 up – because the former @entity74 great did not pass to @entity75			1
@entity6 newspaper @entity76 dedicated a story to it headlined : ‘ @entity79			0
‘ i understand booing every now and then when we have deserved it , ’ the manager began , before adding : ‘ but booing @entity21 is not so easy to understand			2
’ the infamous ' @entity85 ' headline that appeared in @entity6 sports newspaper @entity76 @entity24 coach @entity80 could not comprehend the booing of @entity21 @entity1 celebrates after his sensational goal against @entity89 delivered real the @entity36 last season @entity1 then scored a crucial extra time goal in @entity24 's win over @entity93 in the @entity35 final it meant the world 's most expensive signing ended his first season as a @entity31 champion @entity1 also helped @entity24 lift the @entity38 against @entity65 in his home city of @entity102 in august even @entity103 – yes , the tennis player – chipped in : ‘ it was n’t right			1
the problem with sport , and with life , is that you can go from 0 to 100 , and 100 to 0 in days			0
@entity24 looked like they were going to win the league and three days later everything is a disaster			2
’ he had a point			0
they had gone 31 games unbeaten , only to lose 4 - 3 against @entity89 then 2 - 1 against @entity65			2
but to boo a man with 28 goals in 27 appearances in @entity23 ? perhaps that demonstrates how callous the @entity3 can be , even when 4 - 0 up in front of a depleted 60,174 attendance			2
chances created - 25 ( joint 17th in @entity23 ) assists - 5 ( joint 6th in @entity23 ) @entity1 is in illustrious company , then			1
yet the reports in @entity6 – that he is the latest to be hounded – exaggerate			0
is the only @entity130 at the @entity3 an easy target ? being the world ’s most expensive footballer brings expectation , and @entity1 has not met them this year			1
nowhere near , in fact			0
compare him to his fellow forwards – @entity21 , @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140 – and @entity1 is far off			1
his shooting accuracy ( 51.72 per cent ) is the worst			0
he ’s made the least passes ( 508 ) – this particular statistic far from helping the ‘ selfish ’ tag bestowed upon him – and has had just 287 touches of the ball			0
even @entity139 has had 1,264 in 329 fewer minutes played			0
assists this year ? @entity1 ( 5 ) is joint sixth in @entity23			1
that ’s still less than @entity21 ( 9 ) , @entity138 ( 7 ) , @entity139 ( 7 ) and @entity140 ( 8 )			1
turn to chances created , and @entity1 ( 25 ) is joint 17th			2
way behind @entity153 ( 55 ) , @entity138 ( 49 ) , @entity154 ( 44 ) and @entity21 ( 43 )			1
even @entity139 ( 29 ) and @entity155 ( 25 ) have as many			0
@entity21 is enjoying an exceptional season , having scored 36 goals in 31 matches across all competitions @entity160 star @entity138 has also been out - performing @entity1 in many areas this season @entity89 's @entity153 is leading the way in terms of chances created in the @entity6 league this dip in form has n't helped the talking points			1
against @entity169 on january 4 , @entity1 could and should have passed to @entity140			1
he did n’t , the criticism built , and @entity24 ’s 22 - match winning streak ended in a 2 - 1 defeat			1
@entity21 , the man caught winking at the 2006 @entity37 following @entity175 ’s dismissal , should know those pesky cameras do n’t miss a thing			2
he was beamed around the world , hands on hips , shaking his head , huffing and puffing in disapproval			0
then , against @entity25 on january 10 , @entity1 failed to assist @entity21 in a two - on - one chance			1
the three - time @entity185 winner ’s body language said it all , even though they were 2 - 0 up at the time			0
pass , ’ @entity6 newspaper as tweeted , before labelling him ‘ ball hog @entity191 ’ on their front page the day after			1
the picture of an exasperated @entity21 after @entity1 failed to release the ball to him there have been occasions this season when @entity1 could have chosen a better pass yet we should note , since @entity1 moved to @entity24 on september 1 , 2013 , he has assisted @entity21 eight times			1
vice versa , @entity21 has set @entity1 up just once , against @entity202 on november 29 , 2014			1
@entity1 was asked how he had the audacity to shoot against @entity25			1
‘ all i can remember is that i was going through on goal and i wanted to score , ’ he told @entity204			0
a forward doing what a forward should			0
and so to their 4 - 1 win over @entity211 on january 31 , when @entity1 took the ball off @entity138 – 12 yards out with goalkeeper @entity213 in @entity214 – and missed			1
even on wednesday , in a 2 - 1 win over @entity65 , he was scrutinised			0
another two - on - one scenario squandered , apparently			0
the opening exchanges of @entity80 ’s press conference in the aftermath were spent discussing @entity1			2
the @entity24 manager answered : ‘ that again ? the run was fantastic and at the end he took the right decision			2
i ca n’t ask any more of him			0
’ @entity1 reacts after seeing a chance go begging against @entity211 at the end of last month we forget in between all this @entity21 was sent off for his violent outburst , and @entity1 was relied upon to score an 89th - minute penalty to beat @entity231			1
so , is this a dead debate ? this is a guy that left @entity236 in his dust in the @entity36 final to beat @entity89 with a 60 - metre dash at 16.7mph			0
the man that helped win @entity242 – their 10th @entity35 – with a nod of the head			2
the player that upheld the tradition of @entity250 wingers scoring on their @entity24 debut , emulating @entity252 and @entity253			2
@entity255 ’s @entity254 reminded us last week of a well - known sketch on @entity258 that can relate			0
it goes : ‘ apart from the sanitation , medicine , education , wine , public order , irrigation , roads , the fresh water system and public health , what have the @entity270 ever done for us ? ’ those at the @entity3 should ask themselves that same question with @entity1			2
september 1 , 2013 : @entity1 signs for @entity24 for a world record fee of £ 86million september 14 : the @entity276 scores on his @entity24 debut in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity279 october 30 : scores two and assists two on his first home start at the @entity3 november 30 : first hat - trick - a ' perfect ' one too - for @entity24 , against @entity282 april 16 , 2014 : @entity1 scores the winning goal in the @entity36 final against @entity89			1
his first goal against @entity24 's bitter rivals , and his 20th of the season may 24 : the former @entity289 man scores a goal in extra time in the @entity35 final , which @entity24 go on to win 4 - 1 ... it 's a record 10th @entity31 title for the @entity6 side august 12 : @entity1 's third trophy at @entity24 - the @entity38			1
he sets up the first of @entity21 's two goals in his home city of @entity102 december 20 : another trophy for the @entity276 , and a goal in this final too			2
@entity24 beat @entity303 2 - 0 to win the @entity37 , with @entity1 netting the second december 23 : reports surface of a potential exit , and 54 per cent of @entity24 fans would be happy to see him leave for the right price			1

@entity1 has been *jeered* by the @entity24 fans on occasion this year
he infuriated @entity21 by not releasing pass in @entity25 match
despite winning @entity35 , he is not immune from criticism
@entity191 is a ' ball hog ' are *unfair* but he is under - performing
@entity21 , @entity138 and @entity140 are doing better
@entity1 might have chosen better on a number of occasions this season
