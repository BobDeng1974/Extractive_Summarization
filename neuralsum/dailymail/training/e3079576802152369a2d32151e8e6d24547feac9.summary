by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			2
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			2
this week , @entity10 has his say on @entity13 's new playing position , @entity15 's ' @entity14 ' for the rest of the season and how former non-league stars @entity19 and @entity20 could be ready for the @entity21			1
@entity22 for all these years , @entity13 has had the freedom to make , create and execute anywhere on the pitch he desired			1
his most successful time has been under @entity28 playing in the no 10 position behind @entity30			2
he had that freedom to link the midfield , supply those brilliant passes and save his energy from traipsing back over the halfway line to protect his back four			2
video : scroll down to see @entity39 's press conference class : @entity13 used to excel in a no 10 role , but he has shown his qualities playing as a ' quarter - back ' grit : the experienced midfielder puts in tackles , and controls the tempo for @entity48 i 've often thought his brilliant attacking play was a hindrance to the success of the team , through his lack of defensive responsibility , which has been proven with average years at @entity48 – bar one or two cups – and through poor results in the @entity59 national team			1
but now it 's different			2
with @entity61 injured , @entity13 is their catalyst , their quarter - back			1
he has a responsibility to play with discipline and control , to anticipate the oppositions strengths ; to block , intercept , and defend the dangerous areas around @entity48 's goal			1
i believe this will be like having a new player for @entity59 at the @entity73 in @entity74			1
whether @entity75 will choose @entity13 to play in that role in @entity74 is debatable			1
with the climate and the opposition probably going to have the majority of possession i 'll be interested to see how @entity13 fits into @entity75 's team in the summer			1
path to success : but will he play in that role for @entity59 in @entity74 ? @entity86 anxiety eating away at the top with all the experience and quality that @entity39 has at his disposal he described the performance against @entity92 last week that would 've taken them to the top of the league as ' nervous '			1
we 've all seen it time - after - time , year - after - year , in all different sports			2
my favourite analogy is around @entity100 in football when the teams are twisting and turning			2
it is like the @entity14 of the @entity104			1
the muscles get tighter , they hit the ball 20 yards further , the simple putts end up eight feet past and a standard eight iron going between 162 - 164 yards ends up at 180 and deep in the water			1
trouble : @entity14 is where the best are often find wanting at the @entity113 at @entity86 nervous ? @entity15 may have hit that wall in their title challenge the mind and the emotions can play havoc and the nervous energy drains the body			1
we 've all been there			2
we 've seen it for years as @entity59 supporters in their penalty shoot - outs , which highlights more than anything how anxiety can effect performance at key moments			1
the worst thing any supporter can do now is to boo their players , constantly criticise them and get on their back			0
all the players need is a hug last year when i was in charge at @entity6 we lost at home to @entity140 live on @entity141 at the beginning of february and got booed off			0
at the time we were still four points clear at the top of the @entity146 table			0
my players were shattered , they were drained and they played with no energy			0
i 'm sure the paying public would 've expected a mad rant and rave from me in the dressing room			0
but , instead , i hugged every player , reinforced positive thoughts and , taking the bad days in our stride , we marched onwards			0
different motivation : sometimes , all the players need is a hug , rather than a meltdown title challenge : maybe @entity161 will try a similar tactic ? the last thing they wanted , or needed , was me growling in their faces			1
low - and - behold , only three months later , we were crowned champions for the first time in over 50 years			0
who will win the @entity21 ? it 'll be the team that controls their emotions and copes with the tension through to the finishing line			1
nothing surprises me in this mad world of football how crazy is it that two of the top teams in the @entity183 have got centre forwards banging in the goals that , up until just a few years ago , were playing in the @entity186 ? well i go to watch lower - league football on a regular basis , and it does n't shock me			0
@entity20 , at @entity191 , was playing for @entity193 part - time and working a full - time as well less than two years ago			1
started at the bottom : @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 have proven that you should never give up and @entity19 was a bricklayer playing for @entity196 in 2009 when he was scooped up aged 20 by @entity197			1
neither player went through the academy system ; both were let go , deemed not good enough and both have shown that with hard work and dedication you can fight back and make a living after that heart - breaking rejection			0
for me players are released far too early before they have reached their maximum development and , more often than not , the heartbreaking conversation that ends their dreams finishes their career			0
however , @entity20 and @entity215 are currently in the process of fast - tracking themselves and their clubs into the @entity21 to mix it with the very best in the world			1
@entity221 has got the recipe for success on tuesday night , i went to watch my local team @entity140 take on @entity193			1
a minute before kick - off , the @entity226 manager @entity225 came bouncing up the stairs in the directors ’ box on a scouting mission			1
the @entity225 , as i call him , had driven down straight after training and got caught in the motorway madness			1
i noticed , as he scrambled for a pen , he was still in his club tracksuit and training kit from the afternoon session			0
the fragrance was powerful – but it was the smell of success			2
talented : @entity225 has the flavour for success at @entity226 i asked him why he was there and he told me : ' there 's nothing like watching it yourself , so it 's got to be done			1
' at that level as a manager you have to mix so many ingredients and blend them all together to succeed			0
he is certainly getting the flavour right at the moment			2
the next morning he was in at 9am when the players had a day off , to work on the weekend 's game against @entity255 and then watch his reserve team that afternoon			0
it 's no surprise that the @entity225 is sitting top of @entity146 , three points ahead of his nearest rival with this man set to be a champion			0
last week , at @entity263 for my tuesday night spot on the @entity265 , i went into the make - up studio			0
before you go on air they powder your face to stop the shine on the cameras			0
to clarify : this is standard practice , it 's normal			0
however , as i was about to get off my chair and leave for rehearsals the beautiful young lady there decided , without asking me , to apply some lip balm			0
i sat there – frozen in shock – as she applied what felt like lipstick , and thought : ' @entity285			0
i hope no - one is filming this ! ' i thanked her and immediately upon leaving that room wiped it all off on to my shirt , hoping and praying nobody saw me with those shiny , pouting lips			2
not for me : funnily enough , i did n't fancy having lip balm put on ! i was also lucky enough to be treated to dinner in @entity296 with my two sons @entity298 and @entity19 on thursday night			1
@entity298 is off for four months to work in @entity299 for his company @entity300			0
now , my @entity298 is an extremely bright spark when it comes to figures – and even more so when it comes to settling the bill			0
while i thought i was being treated in a posh restaurant at the top of a sky scraper with all the @entity310 whizz - kids , i experienced once again @entity298 's skill , as a chartered accountant , with figures			0
even though his dad is out of work , as the bill came he looked across the table and said : ' thanks dad , it 's great to see you			0
' i nodded , paid and was a very , very proud dad .			0

it will be interesting to see if @entity13 can play deep role for @entity59
@entity15 are showing ' @entity14 ' nerves on finishing title straight
@entity19 and @entity20 give non-league footballers hope
@entity226 have the flavour for success
