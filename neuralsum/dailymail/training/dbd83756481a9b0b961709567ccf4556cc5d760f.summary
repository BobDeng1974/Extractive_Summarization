by @entity0 published : 04:27 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 26 august 2013 with a twisted and tilted body , @entity2 ’s oldest smock mill was about to fall down after three proud centuries of displaying its industrial strength			1
but thanks to a 15 - year restoration effort led by the bouncing bomb inventor 's son , the @entity7 in @entity8 is back to its best			1
the mill was falling down in the 1970s when a team of volunteers decided to return it to its former glory , which prompted a mammoth restoration effort			1
it is the oldest working smock windmill in @entity2 , dating back to 1650 reconstruction : the mill was falling down in 1969 when volunteers decided to return it to its former glory , which prompted a huge restoration effort , seen ( right ) in 1972 old technology : millstones for grinding grain are seen at the @entity31 , which is open every sunday and @entity32 between may and september complex mechanisms : the machinery attached to the sails is pictured in the cap roof of the @entity31 near @entity21 , @entity8 workings : millstones for grinding grain are seen at the @entity31 near @entity21 , @entity8			1
it is @entity2 's oldest working smock windmill this work to restore the mill - which stands halfway between @entity43 and @entity44 - was led from 1971 by @entity45 , who died in 2006			1
he was the son of sir @entity46 , who invented the bouncing bomb used in the @entity49 raid in @entity50 , @entity51 , in 1943			1
mr @entity52 worked on more than 20 windmills and was a @entity55 engineer in 1969 when he studied the mill and realised it could still be saved			2
the first decade of the restoration in the 1970s was spent restoring the mill ’s structure , before it could be pulled back to its proper shape			1
its eight walls were surrounded with plywood to strengthen the structure with supporting timbers either side			0
it was then given a layer of weatherboarding			0
four new sails were fitted , before the fantail was added - a mechanism to drive the gearing that ensures the main sails always face into the wind			2

the @entity8 mill was first built in the 1650s , making it more than 350 years old huge effort : the first decade of the restoration in the 1970s was spent restoring the @entity8 mill ’s structure , before it could be pulled back to its proper shape rebuild : the windmill has milled some wheat into flour since it was restored to working order , but this is unlikely to repeated			1
it is pictured here being rebuilt in 1977 maintenance : @entity20 is pictured being repainted in 2008			0
the mill was rebuilt in the early 19th century to take advantage of technological improvements on a mission : this effort to restore the mill was led from 1971 by @entity45 ( left ) , who died in 2006			1
he was the son of inventor sir @entity46 ( right ) @entity98 , 64 , has been honorary secretary of the windmill 's restoration committee since 1985 , after moving to the area two years before			1
he told @entity102 : ‘ i ’ve always been interested in historic buildings			1
i think all mills are interesting because they ’re part of our heritage			0
‘ they were really the first machines we had - predecessors to the @entity111			2
historically this is the oldest smock mill in the country			2
‘ its wooden machinery dates to around 1650			0
it has a very unusual construction which dates it			0
our main job now is to keep maintaining it			0
he added : ‘ you can see in many ways how it was adapted and used modern technology to make it more efficient			0
it was in use until about 1915			0
‘ then it was actually used as a weekend cottage by someone in the 1920s			0
then in 1934 it was in a sad state			0
it was about to collapse			0
‘ the @entity134 and some local people realised the importance of the machinery and age , so they patched it up			0
’ the windmill has milled some wheat into flour since it was restored to working order , but this is unlikely to repeated as the structure is now so old			2
it was rebuilt in the early 19th century to take advantage of technological improvements , such as adding a bolter to sift the flour			0
mr @entity98 said : ‘ people had seen it deteriorate from about 1950 and they saw something had to be done			0
from 1971 to 1986 , it took 15 years			2
proud : @entity98 , honorary secretary of @entity153 , stands in the @entity154 by the windshaft and brake wheel of the windmill historic : millstones for grinding grain are seen at the @entity31 in @entity8			1
a 15 - year restoration effort was led by the bouncing bomb inventor 's son old mechanisms : mr @entity98 of the restoration committee stands in the cap roof by the windshaft of the @entity31 near @entity21 , @entity8 age old : millstones for grinding grain are seen at the @entity31 in @entity8			1
the mill was about to fall down in the 1970s before it was restored looking out : a sail is seen through the window of at the @entity31 near @entity21 , @entity8			1
the mill has existed since 1650 wonderful structure : the @entity175 presented a heritage award to @entity20 in honour of those who built and restored it ‘ there was a lot of activity - purely volunteers worked every sunday for the first 10 years , then every other sunday			1
it is now restored to working order			2
‘ we had ground wheat a couple of times back in the 1980s , but we ’ve now decided that it ’s putting it under too much stress , so we now do n’t			0
’ the mill , which was restored by members of the @entity193 , is open to the public every sunday and @entity32 between may and september			2
just last month , the @entity175 presented a heritage award to @entity7 in honour of those who built and restored it			1
a commemorative plaque was received by @entity199 , the widow of mr @entity52 , who took it on behalf of the windmill 's restoration committee .			2

@entity7 in @entity8 was falling down in 1950s before repairs took place from 1971 - 86
restoration led by son of sir @entity46 , who invented @entity49 bouncing bomb used in @entity210
