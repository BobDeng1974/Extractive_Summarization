from the outside , @entity0 's @entity2 building looks rather non-descript			1
but step inside and a secret world of pleasure awaits ... at least it did until the country 's government collapsed in february amid violent protests			1
instead of the standard company gym , tax officials had an array of luxuries to keep them entertained - from a giant jacuzzi and boxing gym to a sauna , massage tables , and even a salt room			1
above , the massive jacuzzi in one of the ' secret ' rooms a ceiling fresco in one of the tax ministry 's entertainment rooms ( not coming to an @entity42 office near you ... ) @entity24 , from @entity26 , was recently given a guided tour of the premises , which revealed the astonishing extent of corruption while the country was under the watch of now ex-president @entity33			1
behind one locked door , for example , lies a boxer 's paradise			1
lower - level tax workers assumed the room contained a secret jail , as they often heard yelling from within			1
the noise was , in fact , bareknuckle fighting matches which were put on for the entertainment of government @entity59			1
another room reveals even more surprises ... and is just the place to unwind after a hard day 's work milking the system			2
behold the massive jacuzzi ( with complicated control panel ) ; angelic fresco on the ceiling ; a deluxe sauna ; plus a cold - water bucket room for that post-steam cool - down			2
right up there in ' things least likely to be found in a tax office ' ... a stand - up tanning booth the salt room - walls , floor , and ceiling covered in sodium chloride - was also made available to dignitaries of the corrupt regime after a busy day massaging the figures , what better way to unwind than a trip to the massage table ? the average @entity0 wage is less than a dollar an hour - but such details did nothing to assuage the guilt of the government cronies			1
and it was a different sort of guilt - namely gilt - which greeted dignitaries when they went to the bathroom : gold glitter decorations at every turn to make the call of nature that much more bearable			2
down the hall lie yet more forms of relaxation : a cryo sauna - a form of extreme cold therapy - for the elite ; and a stand - up tanning booth			2
and finally , the piece de resistance in the last chamber : a salt room			1
here , the walls , floor and ceiling are all covered in the white stuff , which is apparently good for you to breathe in			2
it 's just a shame they did n't care so much about the health of their country			2
spending a penny ? more like spending a fortune in the tax office bathroom the exterior of the revenue office gives little away to reveal the extravagances that lie within anything to say , tax minister @entity132 ? the former minister responsible for the tax office , @entity132 , was unavailable for comment			0
according to security video , he was last seen fighting his way through a metal detector at @entity139 as he made a desperate attempt to flee the country			0
the footage , from february 22 , appears to show prosecutor general @entity143 , @entity132 and their bodyguards in chaotic tussles			0
the pair , who were close allies of @entity33 , were blocked from leaving the country			0
a huge portrait of @entity132 , the minister responsible for the tax office , hangs on a wall in the building it was the same day @entity143 was ousted from the fast - collapsing regime with a vote of no confidence in @entity0 's parliament , as deadly clashes raged in the streets of the capital @entity161			1
days later , @entity143 's opulent mansion near the capital @entity161 was stormed by anti-government protesters , who revealed it was filled with crystal chandeliers and plush golden furniture			0
opulent to the extreme , the lavish estate was just one of several extravagant homes inhabited by the country 's former leaders and top officials			0
the house in the village of @entity177 outside @entity161 was having its value assessed by experts after its owner went on the run			0
however , it was only one of @entity143 's homes			0
he also had the use of a hunting lodge around 20 miles away on a compound with two other lodges , one of them for the use of the deposed president @entity191			0
the hunting estate was also entered by opposition activists , who reportedly found guns and removed files			0
the scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large - scale corruption among the country 's elite , one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in @entity161 and other cities .			0

also in the building : massage tables and *cryotherapy* chamber
@entity59 watched bareknuckle fights in the boxing gym
ceilings *adorned* with frescoes of angels
