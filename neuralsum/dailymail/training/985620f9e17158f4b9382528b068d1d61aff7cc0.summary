by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 20:14 est , 31 january 2013 tens of thousands of small firms ‘ cruelly conned ’ by banks into taking out rip - off loans could get more than £ 10billion in compensation , it emerged last night			1
on another day of shame for @entity10 ’s banking giants , the @entity7 found them guilty of ‘ serious failings ’ over the sale of the complex ‘ interest rate swap ’ loans			1
many deals contained an expensive ‘ break clause ’ , which meant they could not escape the loan without paying a fortune to the bank			0
this could exceed 40 per cent of the value of the original loan			0
scandal : @entity10 's biggest banks will potentially have to pay out billions to the victims of mis - sold interest rate swaps thousands of the loans were sold by the country ’s four biggest banks – @entity31 and @entity32 , both rescued by taxpayers , as well as @entity35 and @entity36			1
yesterday business secretary @entity37 said it is yet another ‘ example of the little guy paying for the big banks ’ wrongdoing			2
’ @entity42 , financial secretary to the treasury , said the victims had been ‘ cruelly conned by the very people they trusted ’ , with many sold loans by banks where they had held accounts for more than 40 years			1
it is the latest in a long list of banking scandals , the most notorious of which has been the £ 12billion mis - selling of payment protection insurance			1
@entity56 @entity57 has run his firm in @entity59 , south - west @entity60 , for 40 years			2
but it has been pushed close to the brink of collapse by a £ 1.75million loan which mr @entity57 , 73 , feels he was ‘ hoodwinked ’ into taking out			2
the company has two businesses – @entity67 and @entity68			2
mr @entity57 ’s wife @entity69 , 73 , does the accounts , their daughter , @entity71 , 47 , is the secretary and their son @entity72 , 50 , runs the building business			0
mr @entity57 took out the loan with @entity32 in february 2008 , and his first quarterly payment for around £ 22,000 was as expected			2
within months , the loan repayments had risen to £ 34,000			2
the loan repayment had dropped to £ 11,000 but there was an extra payment of £ 23,000 for the ‘ swap ’			1
furthermore , mr @entity57 would have to pay a ‘ break cost ’ of around £ 400,000 to get out of the loan			1
mr @entity57 said : ‘ i do feel they hoodwinked me			0
’ they were told they had to continue paying the cost of the ‘ swap ’ for a further five years , even after the five - year loan ends because they had repaid it			1
fortunately , @entity32 has recently suspended the payments following the investigation by the @entity7			1
criticism : the @entity7 claims that 90 per cent of the swaps were wrongly marketed to their buyers ever since the advent of the credit crunch and the financial crisis which has been blamed on banks ' reckless lending policies , financial institutions have become wrapped up in a mounting succession of scandals			1
may 2011 : after a long - running regulatory battle over @entity106 , the big banks admitted they had misled their customers into buying unnecessary coverage and agreed to set aside up to £ 13billion to pay compensation to those affected			1
june 2012 : @entity35 was fined after its traders were found to have manipulated the @entity114 benchmark lending rate			1
the investigation was soon widened to take in a number of other banks			2
august 2012 : @entity118 was accused of breaking sanctions banning trading with @entity121 , by hiding $ 250billion worth of transactions involving the pariah state			0
the bank was fined $ 340million by regulators in @entity126			0
november 2012 : it emerged that @entity36 had enabled criminals ' money laundering by allowing them to set up offshore accounts in @entity131			0
the bank admitted its controls over laundering were too lax and was hit by another huge fine			0
yesterday the @entity137 regulator slammed the banks for ruthlessly taking advantage of small business owners , who were persuaded to take out loans they did not understand			1
many of the victims had no idea the terms contained a stealth clause meaning it would cost them a fortune if interest rates started to fall			1
some of them have gone bust			0
others have been forced to make redundancies or ask staff to work for free , while others are having to raid their pension and savings to keep afloat			0
the @entity7 said it believes at least 40,000 loans were taken out but does not know the exact number of small firms affected			1
some may have taken out more than one loan			0
its initial investigation into 173 of the loans found ‘ over 90 per cent did not comply with one or more of our regulatory requirements ’			1
the compensation bill will be huge , with estimates ranging from £ 1.5billion to more than £ 10billion			2
the average compensation payout for @entity106 from the @entity171 is £ 2,750 but the scale of the compensation to small business owners will be far higher			1
in total , the four big banks have set aside around £ 650million to pay compensation , but this is likely to be just the start of the final bill			1
@entity180 , a director of the @entity181 , said : ‘ giving businesses prompt and proper redress will enable banks to then focus on lending to the real economy			1
’ mr @entity37 added that the immediate priority is ‘ to ensure small businesses are not driven out of business by banks pursuing liabilities for swaps that they mis - sold ’			1
the @entity7 said it found examples of the cost of the ‘ break clause ’ ‘ exceeding 40 per cent of the value of the underlying loan ’			1
last year , when the scandal broke @entity201 mp @entity199 said : ‘ i think it will become as big a scandal as @entity106			1
’ banks have been ordered to complete their reviews of their cases within six months , although those with large numbers of victims are allowed to take up to 12 months			2
@entity210 , of @entity211 , described the announcement as ‘ a @entity214 settlement ’ because it has a hole in the middle – as it is unclear how much compensation will be paid			0
a century ago , @entity220 ’s great - grandfather set up a shop in the high street of the @entity224 town of @entity225			2
now , thanks to a complex loan deal sold by @entity35 , the family business is struggling under a massive debt			2
speaking when the scandal came to light last june , mr @entity220 said he felt angry at the way the bank , which has been the firm ’s ‘ trusted adviser ’ for 100 years , has treated him			0
in 2006 , he took out a loan for around £ 970,000 to make alterations to his electrical shop , but he was advised to take out a swap to protect himself against interest rate rises			1
mr @entity220 , who has worked at the shop since he was 18 , said that he had no idea what he was taking out when an adviser from @entity245 came to speak to him			0
when faced with a barrage of questions from the adviser on his ‘ predictions on the future movements of interest rates ’ , mr @entity220 simply said : ‘ i am an electrical retailer			0
i sell televisions and washing machines			0
’ the consequences have been devastating			0
he estimates the swap has cost him around £ 185,000.each month , he is making payments of around £ 7,700 to @entity35 , but most of the money – around £ 4,500 – goes on the swap			1
the exact payments vary each month			0
mr @entity220 , whose brothers , @entity263 and @entity72 , also work for the business , says the extra financial burden has crippled his business			0
he has had to make two redundancies from his small team of staff			0
his wife , @entity270 , 51 , is retraining as a midwife to try to bring in another source of income			0
the shop , @entity275 of @entity276 , can not sell a wide range of products because they can not afford to buy the stock , although his customers have been extremely sympathetic			0
he said that running a small independent retail store during a double - dip recession is obviously difficult , but @entity35 has made the situation far , far worse			2
‘ having to fight the economic climate was always going to be tough , ' he said			0
‘ but going into the battle with no ammunition [ because of the swap payments ] is really sickening			0
’ a @entity35 spokesman said the bank was working with mr @entity220 to minimise the damage to his firm .			0

@entity7 found banks guilty of ' serious failings '
vast *majority* of the ' interest rate swap ' loans mis - sold to small businesses
*reminiscent* of @entity106 scandal that cost £ 12billion
