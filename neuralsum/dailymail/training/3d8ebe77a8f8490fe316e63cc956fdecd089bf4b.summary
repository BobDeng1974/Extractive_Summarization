@entity1 captain @entity0 has been holding player - only meetings in a bid to put the summer 's disastrous @entity5 behind them			1
this has been a long , testing summer for the @entity1 , whose miserable campaign in @entity11 led to the development of an understandably downbeat mood in the camp			1
there were promising signs on monday night , though , as @entity18 's men kicked off their @entity20 qualifying campaign with a 2 - 0 win against much - fancied @entity22			1
captain fantastic : @entity1 skipper @entity0 has been holding player - only meetings @entity0 believes it was @entity1 's most accomplished showing since they overcame @entity11 2 - 1 at @entity26 in february 2013 and was quick to praise his team - mates after the @entity30 encounter			1
while the @entity1 skipper won his 97th cap , the rest of the line - up had just 186 appearances between them - a lack of experience which led him to hold player - led meetings			1
' we have worked hard and , to be fair , the players have taken a lot of responsibility , ' @entity0 said			2
' we have had meetings among ourselves , just players in the rooms , watching videos and discussing how we can do better as a team			0
leading the way : @entity0 revealed the @entity1 players have discussed how they can play as a better team ' obviously the manager gives us our game plan , but because we do n't spend that much time together as a team we need to know and feel confident in what we 're doing as a team together			2
' in the meetings , you 're having the players speak up who would n't normally speak up when coaches are there			0
' they 've been good and i think the players have really stood up			0
' an outstanding performer in @entity66 was deep - lying midfielder @entity67 , starting his first match for @entity1 having only made his debut as a second - half substitute against @entity71 last week			1
@entity67 was booked early on and looked in danger of a red card at one stage , but grew in composure and presence as the game progressed			2
' he was brilliant , ' @entity0 said of the @entity79 midfielder			0
' his energy , he took the ball			0
early on he had to be a bit careful			0
full of energy : @entity67 's display for @entity1 against @entity22 impressed captain @entity0 ' the referee said to me at half - time to have a word with him , but i think he knew anyway			1
' i spoke to him and told him just to be careful because i think one more and he would have probably been off			0
' but he played really well , took the ball , played with confidence and showed what a top player he is			0

@entity0 has been holding player - only meetings with @entity1 squad
@entity1 captain believes 2 - 0 win over @entity22 was most *acclomplished* performance since 2013 *victory* against @entity11
@entity0 impressed by @entity67 's display in @entity66
