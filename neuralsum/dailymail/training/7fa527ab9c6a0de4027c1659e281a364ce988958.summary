the extremist calling himself @entity18 is understood to have been killed alongside two @entity20 jihadis during fierce clashes in the @entity11 desert town of @entity23			1
he is just the latest in a steady flow of @entity10 militants to be killed fighting for @entity7 in the @entity27 - a figure that has grown dramatically towards the end of the year as @entity31 - led airstrikes target the group 's strongholds and @entity35 and @entity36 forces retake land from the terrorists			1
today it was revealed that @entity31 - led air strikes in @entity11 and @entity41 have killed more than 1,000 jihadis in the past three months , nearly all of them from the @entity44			1
' at least 1,171 have been killed in the @entity46 and international air strikes [ since september 23 ] , including 1,119 jihadists of the @entity44 group and @entity49 , ' said the @entity50 , which relies on a network of activists and medics across the war - ravaged country for its information			0
among the dead were 1,046 members of @entity59 , which has seized large chunks of @entity41 and @entity11 and is the main target of the air campaign			0
seventy - two of those killed were members of @entity67 's branch in @entity11 , the @entity49 , while another was a jihadist prisoner whose affiliation was unknown , an @entity50 statement said			0
the remaining 52 were civilians			0
@entity2 's death was announced on social media by a fighter of @entity5 origin who goes by the @entity75 and who claims to have trained alongside the militant in @entity11			2
he said the @entity78 was killed in @entity23 alongside two militants of @entity20 origin named @entity81 & @entity82			2
@entity7 supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be @entity89 - raised brothers @entity87 and @entity90 , who joined @entity7 in august having only recently converted to @entity91			0
details of @entity2 's true identity are not known and reports of his death could not be independently verified			0
the @entity96 said it was aware of reports of the death of a @entity10 national , but could not confirm their legitimacy due to the lack of consular presence in @entity11			2
he is just the latest in a long line of @entity10 killed fighting for @entity7 in @entity11 and @entity41 in recent months - many of them having travelled to join the group after its declaration of a so - called caliphate in the vast swaths of territory it controls , and @entity113 's self - appointment as a caliph			1
claim : @entity2 's death was announced on social media by @entity4 , who said the @entity78 was killed alongside two @entity20 jihadis during fierce clashes in the @entity11 town of @entity23 reunion : @entity4 claims to have trained alongside the dead @entity10 militant in @entity11 @entity18 was killed in @entity23 alongside two militants of @entity20 origin named @entity81 & @entity82			1
@entity7 supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be @entity89 - raised brothers @entity87 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) @entity126 , who joined @entity7 earlier this year @entity20 's @entity90 bothers ( @entity87 pictured ) joined @entity7 in august having only recently converted to @entity91 the number of @entity10 deaths has risen dramatically towards the end of the year , as the fighter 's naive expectations of @entity133 - style warfare are replaced by the brutal reality of fierce battles with the group 's enemies : @entity67 - affiliated @entity49 , the @entity138 , @entity11 and @entity41 regime armies , @entity140 tribes , @entity142 militias , and a number of other rebel groups in the area			1
their fight is made even harder by near constant airstrikes from warplanes sent by the @entity31 and its @entity46 allies in @entity11 ; and from @entity31 , @entity151 , @entity20 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and of course @entity10 itself in neighbouring @entity41			1
the greatest number of @entity10 killed fighting for @entity7 , however , have been killed in street battles with @entity35 and @entity36 troops , who have been making huge gains in northern @entity11 and western @entity41 since september , having lost vast swaths of territory to @entity7 earlier in the year			1
in recent weeks there have been a number of reports of @entity10 militants expressing their desire to return to @entity10 having grown disillusioned with the reality of fighting for @entity7			1
professor @entity168 from @entity170 's @entity169 for the @entity171 says he was contacted by a man representing a group of up to 30 @entity10 militants , all of whom wanted to return to the @entity10 but were worried about being arrested on their return			0
he believes as many as a fifth of @entity10 fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation and claimed less - hardened jihadists could be used to show would - be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by @entity7 propaganda			2

dead : @entity259 is one of the last images of @entity234 , a @entity10 national who died fighting in @entity11 last year relaxed : briton @entity262 ( white shirt ) was seen pointing up the sky while posing for photos moments before driving a truck full of explosives into a prison killing himself and many others in february in october it emerged that a fourth man from @entity206 , @entity272 - @entity271 , 19 - had died fighting in @entity199 , the scene of fierce fighting between @entity275 and @entity7			1
three others from the same city - @entity277 , 23 , @entity279 , 24 , and @entity202 , 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in october 2013			0

anger : in recent weeks three @entity10 men of @entity294 descent are known to have died fighting for @entity7			2
they include @entity295 ( left ) who previously featured in a chilling @entity7 propaganda video filmed in @entity298 , and @entity299 as - @entity300 ( right ) names of other @entity10 nationals known to have died in @entity11 include @entity262 - a 41 - year - old suicide bomber from @entity303 ; @entity207 - a 30 - year - old father of three from @entity208 who blew himself up in july ; and @entity306 and @entity307 , whose names are known but whose life and death details remain clouded in speculation			1
in recent weeks three @entity10 men of @entity294 descent are known to have died fighting for @entity314 , @entity299 as - @entity300 , and @entity315 as - @entity300			2
all three are understood to have been killed fighting in @entity11 , with @entity295 having previously featured in a chilling @entity7 propaganda video filmed in @entity298			1
while the escalation in deaths of @entity10 nationals fighting for @entity7 may way put off some would - be jihadis joining the terror group , it may not have quite the impact many would expect			1
fingers raised : the third @entity10 man of @entity294 descent killed fighting for @entity7 is @entity315 as - @entity300 ( pictured left alongside the aforementioned @entity295 the fear is that the deaths may actually attract more would - be jihadis to join @entity7 , as young @entity330 are sucked into the warped romance of martyrdom in the name of religion			1
those killed are referred to my their jihadist friends as ' green birds ' in reference to passages in the @entity341 that talks about martyrs living in the hearts of green birds in paradise			0
in fact references to green birds are so prevalent among @entity91 extremists that the easily influenced claim to pray for death to come quickly to hasten their arrival in the afterlife			0
a @entity223 spokesperson said : ' the @entity10 advises against all travel to @entity11 and parts of @entity41			2
anyone who does travel to these areas , even for humanitarian reasons , is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm			0
' ' the best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support @entity10 - registered charities that have ongoing relief operations			0
