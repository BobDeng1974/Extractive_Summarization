you can not judge a book by its cover , the old saying goes			0
but you might be able to judge someone 's personality from the shape of their face , scientists have realised			0
men and women with wide faces tend to be more aggressive , dominant and angry , according to @entity14 research			1
men and women with wide faces tend to be more aggressive , dominant and angry , according to @entity14 research			1
those with broad features - @entity16 ( left ) or @entity17 ( right ) - are more likely to have bad tempers and display bouts of verbal or physical aggression those with broad features - like @entity23 , @entity16 or @entity17 - are more likely to have bad tempers and display bouts of verbal or physical aggression			1
psychologists think the trait is linked to the evolutionary benefit of having thick cheekbones			1
those who had more robust facial bones could be more aggressive , because they could better withstand a punch , the scientists suggest			1
lead researcher dr @entity31 of @entity32 said : ' those with a higher facial width - to - height ratio are more likely to be more aggressive than those with lower facial width - to - height ratio			1
psychologists think the aggressive trait is linked to the evolutionary benefit of having thick cheekbones found in wider faces such as that of footballer @entity23 ( pictured )			1
those who had more robust facial bones could be more aggressive , because they could better withstand a punch , the scientists suggest ' we are not saying that every single person with wider faces will be more aggressive , but if you take a sample of the two groups , those with wider faces will be slightly more aggressive			1
' men with wide faces have been getting a bad reputation lately			1
scientists had previously suggested large faces were prone to being more aggressive , untrustworthy and deceitful			2
but now there may be good news for the likes of @entity59 and @entity23			1
researchers in the @entity61 claim people with wide faces are more likely to get a bonus compared with their thin - faced rivals @entity66 faced workers earn £ 1,300 ( £ 2,090 ) more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus , the study found			2
however , researchers said this comes with a compromise			0
wide faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations			0
and men who are more attractive are better collaborators compared to less attractive men , they said			0
previous research based on the ' facial width - to - height ratio ' found individuals behave more selfishly when interacting with men with wider faces			1
this research claims that while men with wider faces are more likely to lie and cheat , they tend to lead more financially successful firms			1
' we negotiate everyday whether we think about it or not , ' said @entity90 's professor @entity89			0
' it ’s not just the big things , like a car or a home			0
it ’s what time your kid is going to go to bed or what you or your spouse are going to have for dinner			0
' these studies show that being a man with a wider face can be both a blessing and a curse and awareness of this may be important for future business success			2
' the psychologist , whose work is published by the @entity113 journal @entity114 today , said testosterone may be a factor			2
' testosterone tends to make faces wider and testosterone is also linked to aggression , ' she said			1
' we also speculate that there might be an evolutionary link			2
one speculation is that if someone with a wider face gets punched they wo n't be damaged as much			2
they can afford to be more aggressive			0
' dr @entity31 and colleagues at @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 studied 49 women and 54 men aged 18 to 30			0
they measured the breadth from cheek to cheek and the vertical gap between their upper lip and highest point of their eyelids			0
they then asked them a series of questions to assess their dominance , aggression , anger and hostility			2
the psychologists found that those participants with broader features proportionate to the height of their faces were more likely to be aggressive , have bad tempers and be more dominant			1
and they found that the tendencies applied to both men and women			0
not all scientists agree with the findings however			0
a separate piece of research published yesterday by @entity61 researchers , found that facial features trigger a ' face - ist ' response which influence the way personalities are perceived by others			1
but the @entity61 team , whose work was published in the journal trends in @entity176 , said the perceptions are misleading and do not reflect real personality traits			0
@entity180 of @entity181 in @entity182 said : ' although we would like to think our judgments and choices are rational , impartial , consistent , and solely based on relevant information , the truth is that they are often biased by superficial and irrelevant factors			0
' this is a troubling human tendency that needs to be corrected , or at least mitigated , because faces are not valid predictors of a person 's traits			2
a separate study found that on average , fuller faced workers such as @entity197 on the left earn £ 1,300 more than those with narrow faces ( such as that of @entity202 on the right ) when asking for a bonus			0

those with broad features , like @entity23 , are more likely to get angry
trait may be linked to the evolutionary benefit of having thick cheekbones
those who had more robust facial bones could better withstand a punch
testosterone tends to make faces wider and is also linked to aggression
