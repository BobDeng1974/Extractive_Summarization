by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 30 august 2012 just 18 months ago @entity1 was a lively , active schoolgirl			1
but in february 2011 she suffered a brain bleed caused by an undetected tumour			1
although she battled back from the brink she was left paralysed and today , aged just nine , she is the world 's youngest locked - in syndrome sufferer			1
this means she understands everything that is going on around her but can barely move in response			2
now her parents are speaking out about her condition , following the death of fellow locked - in sufferer @entity15 , whose @entity18 battle sparked a public debate about assisted suicide			1
hoping for the best : @entity22 and mother @entity23 with daughter eve , who fell ill suddenly in february 2011			1
eve ( left ) with her younger sister in august 2010 before she suffered a brain bleed and pictured together in march this year ( right ) @entity1 's stepfather , @entity29 , 32 , said : ' @entity15 's story has really helped raise awareness of it			1
as a family we feel very alone and that there are not many people out there who understand what we 're going through			2
' eve , who once loved @entity41 and @entity43 dancing , can now do nothing for herself			2
her parents must give her medication and feed her through a tube in her stomach several times a day			2
the youngster from @entity51 , @entity52 , was rushed to @entity53 after collapsing at home			0
the day before she had developed a rash on her neck and complained of pain behind one eye			0
she was transferred to @entity60 's @entity59 where a scan revealed @entity1 had suffered a major brain bleed			1
surgeons operated to relieve some of the pressure on her skull and later told her parents they had n't expected her to survive for more than four days			2
but @entity1 did battle on and three months later she opened her eyes			1
however , she now could n't move so speech therapists taught her how to communicate by blinking			0
her mother @entity23 , 34 , said : ' it was extremely emotional to realise she was trying to answer a question			0
it took her up to 60 seconds to blink to say yes			0
' @entity23 and @entity22 with @entity74 ( centre ) , @entity73 ( right ) and @entity39 ( left ) in february 2010 a year before @entity39 was rushed to hospital eve , pictured with brother @entity73 during last @entity78 ( left ) still has a cheeky personality since suffering locked - in syndrome ( right ) , according to her step - father doctors then found the brain tumour that had caused the bleed and in august 2011 , @entity1 went through a six - week course of radiotherapy			1
since then @entity39 has continued to improve slowly and was discharged last november			0
she can now smile or grimace to express her emotions			0
mr @entity29 told @entity89 : ' she can stick her tongue out if she wants a drink and when you brush her teeth she spits the toothpaste out			0
' however , he added : ' we just have to try and guess what she wants			0
it is more emotion that we get from her and we have learned to read her facial expressions			0
' he said @entity1 still had a cheeky personality , smiling whenever her younger siblings @entity73 , 3 , and @entity74 , 7 , are naughty			1
she undergoes multiple therapies to help strengthen her limbs @entity1 loved @entity41 and @entity43 dancing before she fell ill @entity15 , suffered a massive stroke in 2005 , which left him with locked - in syndrome			1
he wanted to have an assisted - suicide in the @entity110 although her parents hold on to the hope that she will one day get better they know there is no guarantee that this will happen			1
they have adapted their home to give it wheelchair access and @entity39 receives physiotherapy and speech and language therapy amongst other treatments			0
she is signed up to go to a new primary school for children with special needs			0
@entity23 and @entity22 are now busy raising Â£ 25,000 to pay for sensory equipment and hydrotherapy sessions to improve @entity1 's quality of life			1
' at present , @entity1 has a poor quality of life and however hard we try , it never seems like she has much to look forward to on a day to day basis , ' they wrote on their @entity138 charity page			2
' any kind of help to be able to buy @entity39 something to make her life worth living would mean the world to us			0
' some locked - in sufferers have improved over time			1
@entity146 from @entity147 , developed the condition following a mystery illness			2
however , he started to improve in his teens and communicated via a computer			0
now 37 , he now has the strength to push a vacuum cleaner and is married and living in @entity154 , @entity155			0
locked - in syndrome victim , @entity15 , passed away aged 58 last week after refusing any more food			1
he had been unable to move since suffering a stroke seven years ago			0
he had described his life as ' intolerable ' and recently lost a court battle to allow doctors to end his life without facing punishment			0
while @entity23 and @entity165 will never ask for assisted suicide they believe mr @entity15 should have been allowed to have his life ended			2
mr @entity29 said , referring to eve : ' for now we still hold on to hope she will get better			2
