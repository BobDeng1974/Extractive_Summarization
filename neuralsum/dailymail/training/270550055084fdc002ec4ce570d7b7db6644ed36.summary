sir @entity0 , @entity1 's chief inspector for schools , has warned rowdy behaviour in class is dragging schools down @entity9 behaviour in class and a contempt for learning are dragging @entity14 pupils behind their peers in @entity17 countries , the chief inspector of schools will warn today			1
the education of 700,000 children – one in ten overall – is suffering because teachers are failing to crack down on ‘ horseplay ’ , sir @entity0 will say			1
in a speech to mark the launch of @entity1 ’s annual report , he plans to describe how schools are plagued by a ‘ casual acceptance of low - level disruption and poor attitudes to learning ’ that is ‘ a million miles away from the sort of cultures we see in some of the high - performing @entity17 countries ’			1
the comments come a week after the @entity35 revealed that 15 - year - old @entity17 children are easily outperforming other students from around the world			1
@entity40 pupils came outside the top 20 in maths , science and reading for the first time – and are now lagging an average of around three years behind their counterparts in the @entity46			2
the results painted a troubling picture of the @entity40 ’s ability to compete with countries where teachers are revered and iron - willed pupils study for 12 hours or more every day			2
@entity1 plans to focus on behaviour during the coming year , and headteachers will be expected to take back control of classrooms , sir @entity0 will announce			1
only by creating ‘ the calm and respectful culture essential for learning ’ can classes avoid being hijacked by ‘ background chatter , inattention and horseplay ’			0
he will go on to say : ‘ unless this changes , teachers will struggle to create an environment in which all children learn well			2
’ the former headteacher criticised teachers last month for failing to show pupils that adults are in charge			2
he said there was ‘ nothing wrong ’ with telling children : ‘ do as i ask because i am the adult			2
’ he also attacked a generation of headteachers who are too weak - willed to lead by example , explaining : ‘ children can not thrive in a chaotic school where there is little authority			1
’ school staff were handed new powers in 2011 to tackle disruptive pupils			2
teachers were given more leeway to use force , the right to search children for items such as mobile phones – and financial penalties were increased for parents who allow their children to truant			0
how @entity40 's schools are lagging behind some of the best performing @entity17 schools other powers teachers have been given include issuing no - notice detentions			1
and a school ’s decision to exclude a pupil can no longer be reversed by an appeals panel			0
education secretary @entity104 said the measures would give disruptive pupils an ‘ unambiguous lesson in who ’s boss ’			0
a quarter of free schools have opened in areas where there is no demand for extra places , according to an official report			0
the @entity115 said 42 of the 174 schools set up over the past three years are in districts with ‘ no forecast need ’			0
it means £ 241million out of the £ 950million in set - up costs has so far been spent in areas where there are already surplus places			0
but sir @entity0 ’s speech will suggest that he believes teachers still lack the confidence to exert their authority after years of seeing their powers eroded			1
he will also insist today that poverty is no longer an excuse for academic failure , and will describe the nation ’s ‘ education lottery ’ which sees the country divided into ‘ lucky and unlucky children ’			0
he believes that some of the ‘ unluckiest children ’ are those living in relatively affluent areas in the @entity139 , which are let down by coasting schools			0
the annual report is expected to outline a blueprint for a ‘ national service ’ of top teachers and headteachers who are ready to be deployed to failing areas to help turn them around			1
the @entity148 and the @entity149 in particular will be criticised			0
but sir @entity0 will claim the ‘ battle against mediocrity ’ in @entity14 education is being won , with eight out of ten schools now judged good or outstanding – the highest proportion in @entity1 ’s 21 - year history			1
a @entity158 spokesman said : ‘ sir @entity0 is right – bad classroom behaviour is hugely disruptive to children ’s education			1
it means teachers ca n’t teach and pupils ca n’t learn			0
‘ that is why a key part of our reforms is restoring discipline in schools and why we have strengthened teachers ’ powers to put them back in charge			0

@entity14 pupils lagging behind @entity17 countries , sir @entity0 warns
he will make the claim in speech to mark launch of @entity1 's annual report
inspectors will focus on behaviour in the next year and headteachers will be expected to take back control of the classrooms
' children can not thrive in a chaotic school where there is little authority ' sir @entity0 will say
