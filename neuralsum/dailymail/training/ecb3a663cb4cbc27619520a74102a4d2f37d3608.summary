the @entity5 head coach will on wednesday name his team to face @entity9 in friday night ’s hotly anticipated opening @entity3 clash with @entity1 expected to be named on the bench and @entity13 star @entity12 starting in the pivotal fly - half position			1
but former team - mate @entity15 – a former @entity5 star who was part of @entity17 2007 @entity19 winning team which included a teenage @entity1 – believes @entity20 should go one better and start the in - form @entity21			1
@entity1 should be @entity5 's fly half during the @entity3 , according to former winger @entity15 @entity15 ( left ) believes there is nobody better than @entity1 in the @entity5 attack backs : @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity1 , @entity12 , @entity29 , may , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 forwards : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ‘ i ’m a massive @entity1 fan , ’ @entity15 told @entity50			1
‘ attacking-wise i do n’t think there is anyone better than him in @entity5			1
it would be good for him to get a chance to show what he can do and reignite his career again			2
‘ his pace and his passing accuracy were the two things that stood out about him as a youngster			0
if you ’ve got a 10 who can pass the ball and is a threat himself it opens options up all over the field			0
‘ he looks back to his best with a good team around him and it ’s paying dividends			0
sale are doing so well now and that ’s paying massive dividends			0
‘ the recent @entity74 create so many holes is because of the threat @entity76 poses			0
there are threats all over field			0
@entity1 can do that for @entity5			1
he is such a huge talent			0
’ @entity1 , 27 , spent six years in the international wilderness after falling out with former boss @entity83 following a spectacular introduction in 2008			1
but his superb recent form for @entity71 has forced @entity20 to reconsider him , while @entity87 ’s injury has opened the door further for a player @entity15 recalls as one of the most exciting talents he ever played with			1
@entity1 spent six years in the wilderness but returned for @entity5 in the summer the @entity21 impressed this season with some fine form for club side @entity94 @entity15 goes over for a try for @entity5 during the @entity97 match with @entity98 in 2007 ‘ he was always amazing in training but that was a great @entity17 team with some special players , ’ he said			1
‘ the thing that made you think ‘ wow , he is amazing ’ was the fact he came into that team at such a young age and fitted in straight away			0
he ’s a special talent who still has a lot to offer @entity5			1
’ with @entity112 expected to start ahead of @entity1 , with @entity29 at outside centre and @entity28 or @entity31 at inside centre , @entity15 says @entity5 will go far if they get their midfield right			1
‘ the 10 - 12 - 13 combination needs to be sorted out quickly , ’ he said			0
‘ i liked @entity112 in the autumn			0
i thought he brought something different in terms of his attacking style and he ’s quite cultured player who can kick to the corners			2
he brings another element to @entity87			0
‘ @entity123 is being missed and @entity5 really need to identify who they want to play in that midfield and stick with it			2
if it ’s @entity28 and @entity129 then that ’s a combination that can really work			0
‘ the pack of forwards is as good as anyone ’s and if @entity5 can get their midfield sorted then i think they ’ll be really dangerous			2
’ @entity15 says he likes @entity12 in the autumn and he brings another element to @entity87 @entity15 is taking part in the new urban obstacle race @entity137 for @entity138 on 30th may 2015			2
