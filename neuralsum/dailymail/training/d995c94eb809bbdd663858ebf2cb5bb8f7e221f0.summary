by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner the most encouraging aspect of @entity3 ’s first netball victory of this @entity4 was not the way they outwitted , outscored and outlasted a lacklustre @entity8 team			1
or the individual honours for @entity10 , earning her 50th cap , and 19 - year - old @entity12 scoring five times on her @entity3 debut			1
it was their collective belief that a 65 - 25 victory was no more than they expected or deserved			1
it was simply an important step if they are going to win a historic gold medal a week on sunday			0
outclassed : @entity10 ( @entity22 ) helps @entity3 toward a 65 - 25 victory over @entity8 at the @entity4 ‘ we ’ll bank that , ’ said 33 - year - old head coach @entity25			1
‘ but we know we need to be better tomorrow			0
@entity27 , who have traditionally dominated the sport alongside @entity30 , await this morning			1
between them , the @entity32 sides have claimed every gold since netball became a @entity4 sport in 1998			0
great expectations : @entity3 believe they can do better than the bronze that they won in @entity40 @entity3 have taken bronze three times			2
‘ at @entity40 four years ago we were ecstatic with bronze , ’ said captain @entity43			0
in @entity45 , simply being on the podium will not suffice			0
a 3 - 0 test series win over @entity27 last year has given them belief that they can disrupt the duality at the top — and @entity43 knows the stakes are high			2
‘ it could be a breakthrough tournament for @entity3 netball , it feels like everyone ’s watching , ’ she said .			0

@entity3 *defeated* @entity8 65 - 25 at the @entity4 in @entity45
@entity10 earned her 50th cap while @entity12 scored five on debut
@entity3 must beat the likes of @entity27 and @entity30 to better their usual bronze
