it has long been though that a comet struck @entity2 12,800 years ago , bringing an end to the @entity4			1
this event was thought to have not only sparked climate change , but also killed @entity8 's earliest people and caused a mass animal extinction			2
but a new study suggests this comet theory is false , as most supposed impact indicators at 29 sites are too old or too young to be remnants of an ancient comet			1
theories that a comet struck @entity2 at the end of the @entity4 12,800 years ago ( artist 's illustration shown ) may be wrong , according to a new study			1
the researchers say evidence for dating at 29 impact sites across @entity8 suggesting a comet sparked a brief period of cooling after the @entity4 is flawed controversy over what sparked the @entity29 , a brief return to near glacial conditions at the end of the @entity4 , includes a theory that it was caused by a comet hitting the @entity2			1
as proof , proponents point to sediments containing deposits they believe could result only from a cosmic impact			0
one theory is that the circulation of warm tropical weather in the @entity42 was shutdown by an influx of fresh water from @entity46 in in @entity47 and deglaciation			0
this , some scientists say , explains why the 1,300 - year deep freeze occurred after the @entity4 ended			2
another theory is the impact hypothesis , which suggests a comet slammed into the planet and led to widespread cooling			1
volcanic activity has also been suggested as a cause			0
a sizeable eruption , with one culprit potentially being the @entity62 volcano in @entity63 , could have significantly changed temperatures in the northern hemisphere			0
now a new study disproves that theory , said archaeologist @entity68 of the @entity69 in @entity70			0
@entity71 is lead author on the study and an expert in the @entity74 culture , the peoples who lived in @entity8 at the end of the @entity4			1
his research team found that nearly all sediment layers purported to be from the @entity4 at 29 sites in @entity8 and on three other continents are actually either much younger or much older			1
scientists agree that the brief episode at the end of the @entity4 - officially known as the @entity29 after a flower that flourished at that time - sparked widespread cooling of the @entity2 12,800 years ago and that this cool period lasted for 1,000 years			1
but theories about the cause of this abrupt climate change are numerous ; they range from changes in ocean circulation patterns caused by glacial meltwater entering the ocean to the cosmic - impact theory			0
the cosmic - impact theory is said to be supported by the presence of geological indicators that are extraterrestrial in origin			2
however a review of the dating of the sediments at the 29 sites reported to have such indicators proves the cosmic - impact theory false , said @entity71			1
@entity71 and his co-authors found that only three of 29 sites commonly referenced to support the cosmic - impact theory actually date to the window of time for the @entity4			1
the findings , ' chronological evidence fails to support claim of an isochronous widespread layer of cosmic impact indicators dated to 12,800 years ago , ' were reported in the @entity112			1
' the supposed impact markers are undated or significantly older or younger than 12,800 years ago , ' report the authors			1
' either there were many more impacts than supposed , including one as recently as five centuries ago , or , far more likely , these are not extraterrestrial impact markers			2
' in @entity8 , the @entity4 was marked by the mass extinction of several dozen genera of large mammals , including mammoths , mastodons , @entity8 horses , @entity125 camels , two types of deer , ancient bison , giant beaver , giant bears , sabre - toothed cats , giant bears , @entity8 cheetahs and many other animals , as well as plants			1
scientists agree that a brief episode at the end of the @entity4 sparked widespread cooling of the @entity2 12,800 years ago and that this cool period lasted for 1,000 years			1
but theories about the cause of this abrupt climate change are numerous including the cosmic - impact theory based on sites in places like @entity147 the @entity148 rests heavily on the claim that there is a @entity29 boundary layer at 29 sites in the @entity153 and elsewhere that contains deposits of supposed extraterrestrial origin that date to a 300 - year span centered on 12,800 years ago			1
the @entity29 period is also known as the @entity158			0
it was a period of cold climatic conditions and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 years ago			1
scientists believe this change in climate was caused by a meteor impact , but another theory is that it was because of the collapse of the @entity8 ice sheets			1
during the period , forests in @entity171 were replaced with a glacial tundra			0
there was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in @entity178			0
the drier conditions caused drought in the @entity181 , known as the region of @entity183 or the @entity184 , which led inhabitants to agriculture			0
the change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation			0
the deposits include magnetic grains with iridium , magnetic microspherules ( microscopic spherical particles ) , charcoal , soot , carbon spherules ( small spheres ) , glass - like carbon containing nanodiamonds and fullerenes ( molecules made entirely of carbon ) with extraterrestrial helium , all said to result from a comet or other cosmic event hitting the @entity2			2
@entity71 and his colleagues tested that hypothesis by investigating the existing rock layers ( known as stratigraphy ) and chronological data sets reported in the published scientific literature to determine if these markers dated to the onset of the @entity29			0
they sorted the 29 sites by the availability of radiometric or numeric ages and then the type of age control , if available , and whether the age control is secure			1
the researchers found that three sites lack absolute age control : at @entity228 , @entity229 , the three @entity74 points found lack stratigraphic context , and the majority of other diagnostic artifacts are younger than @entity74 by thousands of years			2
at @entity234 , @entity229 , ridges are assumed without evidence to be chronologically correlated with @entity4 hills 1,600 miles ( 2,600 kilometers ) away , while at @entity237 , @entity238 , horizontal integrity of the @entity74 artifacts found is compromised , according to that site 's principal archaeologist			2
the remaining 26 sites have radiometric or other potential numeric ages , but only three date to the @entity29 boundary layer			0
at @entity249 , @entity250 ( pictured ) @entity71 and his team used the data of previous researchers but returned a different equation that put the cosmic - impact markers at a depth well above that which would mark the @entity29 onset , suggesting the cosmic - impact theory is wrong at eight of the sites , the ages are unrelated to the supposed @entity29 boundary layer , as for example at @entity265 , @entity266 , where extensive mixing of artifacts amongst the rock layers found at the site makes it impossible to know their position to the supposed @entity29 boundary layer			2
where direct dating did occur , it was some time after the 16th century @entity278 according to the researchers			0
at @entity280 , @entity229 , a radiocarbon age of 10,980 purportedly dates extraterrestrial impact markers from sediment in the skull of an extinct horse			0
in actuality , the study claims the date is from an extinct musk ox , and the fossil yielding the supposed impact markers was not dated , nor is there evidence to suggest that the fossils from @entity280 are all of the same age or date to the @entity29 onset			2
at nearly a dozen other sites , the authors report , the chronological results are neither reliable nor valid as a result of significant statistical flaws in the analysis , the omission of ages from the models , and the disregard of statistical uncertainty that accompanies all radiometric dates			0
for example , at @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity71 and his team used the data of previous researchers but returned a different equation that put the cosmic - impact markers at a depth well above that which would mark the @entity29 onset			0
the authors go on to point out that inferences about the ages of supposed @entity29 boundary layers are unsupported by replication in more cases than not .			0

scientists have previously suggested a comet hit @entity2 12,800 years ago
evidence for this comes from 29 different sites across @entity8
but new research suggests the dating *methods* used were flawed
study suggests the impact sites are too old or young to be from a comet
researchers *conclude* cooling period after @entity4 has another origin
