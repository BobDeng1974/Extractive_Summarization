live bears were used by the @entity3 military to test the safety of the pilot ejection capsule on the world 's first supersonic jet bomber , it has emerged			1
the @entity8 was created in the 1950s during the height of the cold war			2
it was faster than the @entity13 jets at the time and was the first ever bomber capable of @entity16 - the term given to planes flying at twice the speed of sound			1
scroll down to watch video trapped : a drugged bear is tightly strapped into the ejection capsule of a @entity8 to test its safety take off : the @entity8 - which was the first aircraft to travel at twice the speed of sound - prepares to take off in the @entity27 video test dummies : the @entity27 used @entity30 and @entity3 black bears to test the aircraft 's ejection system which rocketed pilots into the sky before automatically opening into a parachute but the plane had several issues - including that the crew could not use the emergency ejection system when the plane was flying at @entity16			1
a new ejection was designed so crew could evacuate at any time but the @entity27 wanted to test the safety of the aircraft 's ejection system before letting its elite pilots try it out			1
a pre-ejection handle yanked the pilot 's legs in close before enclosing him in a shell that still allowed rudimentary control of the plane , i09.com reports			0
the actual ejection handle then sent the capsule up with a rocket burst and automatically deployed a parachute			0
the capsule could float and contained survival supplies in the event of a crash			0
spectators : members of the @entity27 watch the ejection capsule descending to the ground on a parachute a crew member looks in on a bear used to test the ejection system after it lands back on earth none of the bears used in the experiments died during the test flights but some did suffer broken bones and internal injuries live @entity30 and @entity3 black bears were sedated and then sent up in the four jet engine aircraft to test the new ejection system			1
the bears were ejected at various altitudes and speeds in a various conditions to check its safety			0
upon landing , the bears were checked over for any injuries			0
some did suffer broken bones , internal injuries and bruising but no bears died in the test flight ejections			1
the ejection tests , which saw bears ejected at speeds up to @entity96 at 45,000 feet , and medical checks after the flights can be seen in an air force video			2
but i09 reports that a white paper by the @entity102 , called @entity103 , states that the bears were euthanised and underwent an autopsy afterwards			0
members of the @entity27 carry the bear out of the aircraft capsule the bear is put on to a stretcher and carried over to another aircraft to take it back to a @entity3 @entity27 base the @entity113 were only used for around ten years until intercontinental missiles made the need for their use obsolete			2

the @entity27 used @entity30 and @entity3 black bears to test the safety of the @entity8 's ejection system
*hustlers* were the first aircraft to fly at twice the speed of sound - @entity16
the bears suffered broken bones but none were killed in the tests
