@entity3 has now launched its own version of this feature , called ' on this day ' , that works in an almost identical way			2
each day the social network will highlight posts made on the same date years before either by that user , or posts that the user was tagged in			1

' people often look back at old photos and other memories they 've shared on @entity3 , and many have told us that they enjoy products and features that make this easier , ' said the site in a blog post			2
' on this day shows content from this date in the past			0
for example , you might see past status updates , photos , posts from friends and other things you 've shared or been tagged in - from one year ago , two years ago , and so on			0

currently , when statuses , photos and videos are uploaded , the app shows what was similarly posted on this day a year ago , for example			0
the new official tool ( pictured ) is rolling out to users in stages , so not everyone will be able to see it yet on this day is similar to the @entity5 app that can be installed to @entity3 's web and mobile site ( examples shown )			1
a major difference between the @entity5 app and @entity3 's tool , though , is that @entity5 also collates posts made on @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 in addition to @entity3 one in five @entity79 users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. to capitalise on this , the @entity89 firm has launched its latest standalone app called layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations			1
photos can be selected from the phone 's camera roll , or taken with the @entity101 tool , and layouts can then be ' remixed ' and edited with mirror effects and flips			0
