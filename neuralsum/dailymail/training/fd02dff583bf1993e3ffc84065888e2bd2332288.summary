space enthusiasts keen to explore the skies but deterred by the hefty price tag will soon be able to board a rocket for a fraction of the cost			1
passengers in the @entity7 will be able to experience weightlessness and view the earth from over 300,000ft above the @entity10 - for a ' bargain ' price of $ 95,000 ( £ 57,000 )			1
this may sound expensive , but is almost two thirds cheaper than a ride on sir @entity17 's @entity16			1
plus , the @entity7 spacecraft seats just two people - compared to sir @entity17 's six - seater - and passengers are encouraged to help pilot the ship			1
@entity23 is based at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
its @entity7 spacecraft , illustration pictured , seats two people - the passenger and a pilot - and tickets cost $ 95,000 ( £ 57,000 )			1
this is almost two thirds the price of sir @entity17 's @entity35 more than 200 tickets for a trip already been sold for the spacecraft that takes off and lands vertically using its reusable rocket propulsion system			1
@entity40 , chief executive and co-founder of @entity25 - based @entity23 , is convinced making space travel financially viable is the key to exploring the skies			1
he said : ‘ we have to go a couple of levels deeper than passion			0
when you look at the question of why it is so many years after we first went to space yet so little of it is being used , it 's because it just costs too much			0
‘ we have to do something to fundamentally reduce the cost before space becomes an economic good			2
we looked at that problem and not having a billionaire writing your cheques , it had to be a money making proposition			0
’ this graphic explains what happens during the 30 - minute flight			1
around 50 seconds after the engines are lit , the craft goes supersonic			1
around three minutes after lighting the engine , passengers reach 180,000ft			1
craft travels at @entity73 before the engines cut off and coasts to peak altitude of 350,000ft the spacecraft , illustration pictured , seats two people and takes off and lands vertically using its reusable rocket propulsion system			1
it will fly four times a day and the passenger will be expected to get involved in piloting the ship			1
for example , they 'll be asked to perform tasks and make sure dials are holding steady passengers will put on white space suits two hours before boarding the spacecraft and embarking on the 30 - to 50 - minute flight			1
@entity93 , a vice president at @entity7 , said things move very quickly : ‘ there is just 15 seconds between lighting the engines and take off			1
then 50 seconds after lighting the engines you go supersonic and very close to vertical and are pushed back in your seat			2
then three minutes after lighting the engines you are at 180,000ft			2
’ @entity40 continued : ‘ you are going more or less straight up at about @entity73			0
' then the engines cut off and you have about a minute and a half of zero gravity as you coast up to our peak altitude of 350,000ft - then another minute and a half of coasting back down until there is enough atmosphere for the vehicle to feel it			1
' aerospace company @entity7 hopes to begin testing its @entity7 rocket , which will carry one pilot and one passenger , later this year , but other organisations are vying to beat @entity7 to the launch			1
here is an overview of some of the other companies in the race to put civilians in space : @entity16 - sir @entity17 's @entity123 and @entity125 the company 's @entity35 holds two pilots and six passengers who are seated with two large windows , one to the side and one overhead , so they can enjoy the view if they do not want to float freely when they achieve weightlessness			1
the @entity134 is 60ft long with a 90 - inch diameter cabin			0
the spaceship is connected to @entity16 's carrier aircraft @entity137 and when it reaches the right altitude , @entity134 is released and propelled forward and upward , accelerating into space at almost 2,500mph			0
clients have paid $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) for a ticket , including celebrities such as @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			2
the @entity134 ( pictured below ) completed its third supersonic test flight in january			0
space adventures - @entity149 space adventures has arranged all eight of the flights to orbital space - when the spacecraft is travelling fast enough to go into orbit - completed by seven private citizens so far			1
@entity156 soprano @entity155 is due to be the next passenger and is scheduled to travel to the @entity158 in october 2015			2
the company has partnered with @entity149 to offer suborbital flights to space			2
the @entity149 suborbital rocket seats two passengers and is flown autonomously from the mission control centre			2
it lands and takes off vertically while the large windows offer panoramic views of the @entity10 and sky			0
the rocket reaches 100km above earth and uses ethanol and liquid oxygen fuelled engines , which have flown more than 200 test flights in the last decade			2
@entity175 - set up by @entity177 founder @entity176 the vehicle includes a crew capsule carrying three or four astronauts on a separate rocket - powered propulsion module			0
following lift - off , the combined vehicles accelerate for about two - and - a - half minutes before the propulsion module shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the crew capsule			2
the propulsion module finishes its flight , descends to @entity10 , and autonomously performs a rocket - powered vertical landing while the crew capsule coasts to the edge of space			0
after descent and re-entry into @entity10 's atmosphere , the crew capsule will land under parachutes near the launch site			0
@entity197 @entity197 's @entity199 reusable development vehicle ( pictured right ) is already in test mode and it will eventually deliver the smaller @entity201 containing humans into space			0
@entity204 made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the @entity158 and safely return cargo to @entity10 , a feat previously achieved only by governments			0
astrium the business jet - sized spaceplane will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport runway using its jet engines			0
at an altitude of about 12km , the rocket engine will be ignited and in only 80 seconds the craft will climb to 60km altitude			0
the rocket propulsion system will then be shut down as the plane ’s inertia carries it on to over 100km , enabling passengers to hover weightlessly			2
operators using the spaceplane could offer safe space flight for a price per passenger of around € 200,000 ( £ 120,000 )			1
he said re-entry then takes about a minute and the craft glides to land in approximately 20 minutes			2
the spacecraft , which will be able to fly four times a day , seats just the pilot and the passenger will be expected to get involved during the adventure			1
they will be asked to perform tasks , such as reading instruments and making sure dials are holding steady			0
' it 's your flight so if there is some particular part of the earth that you want to look at we can steer the ship to look at the @entity248 or the area you find of most interest , ’ @entity93 added			0
‘ then you have time to look around and soak up being where so few have been before			0
’ the first model will take travellers 200,000ft above the @entity10 , but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft and it will not be too long before they are ready to take to the skies and reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft			0
the @entity7 aircraft has four engines , pictured , as well as rocket pumps and a propulsion bay			2
passengers sit in the pressure cabin			0
the first model will take travellers 200,000ft up but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft and it will not be too long before they are ready to reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft the @entity7 aircraft and its jet propulsion system , pictured , is still undergoing tests			1
@entity7 claims the first public flights should launch in between six and 18 months ‘ we expect to be in flight tests by the end of the year , after the first tests we wo n't know how long until we are ready to take the first passengers but my guess is six to 18 months			1
‘ i think we will be flying participants by the end of next year but we do n't like to put a date on things , ’ @entity93 said			0
there are also very few physical limitations , so even those in poor health may be able to travel			0
‘ some people can not handle the excitement , some people are claustrophobic , so we take them in a high performance aeroplane to test if they have a psychological problem but in the broad sense , if you can on a rollercoaster , you can do this because the time you are doing it is short			0
‘ it means people in ill health who want to do this while they still can are able to , ’ added @entity93			0
@entity23 is housed in a small former @entity303 base at the @entity24 in @entity25 .			1

@entity23 is based at the @entity24 in @entity25
its @entity7 spacecraft seats two people - the passenger and a pilot
tickets for the trip cost $ 95,000 ( £ 57,000 ) - almost two thirds the price of sir @entity17 ’s @entity35
flights will travel up to 350,000ft and last between 30 and 50 minutes
more than 200 tickets for the @entity7 trip have already been sold
@entity7 will offer four flights a day and passengers will become *co-pilots*
craft is undergoing tests and first public flights should launch in by 2016
