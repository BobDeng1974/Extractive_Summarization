by @entity0 from puppeteers and musicians to acrobats , folk singers and magicians , this is no ordinary community			2
clustered together in one @entity9 slum , the 2,800 families are all street performers			1
the origins of the multi-talented @entity12 colony are unknown despite only dating back 40 years			1
creative : @entity13 , 44 ( left ) , @entity14 , 49 , and @entity15 are all painters living in the @entity18 community in a collection of @entity9 slums where all their neighbours perform facing the street : @entity23 , 50 , a head balancer ( left ) , and @entity25 , an 80 - year - old puppeteer ( right ) , are protesting the government 's move to oust to community variety : after 40 years , the 2,800 performers in the slum - including @entity32 , 30 , and @entity33 , 45 , who make elephants , are being forced to leave monkey tamer : @entity36 , 45 , spends his time rehearsing new tricks with his pet monkeys , which he takes to the street to perform with but over time , it has inspired a cultural phenomenon			1
however , as the government pushes a drive to spruce up the area , they are now being ordered to pack up and leave to make way for luxury flats			2
the move has sparked fears of a creative drought in the region			2
in a bid to capture the beauty of the community , @entity54 photographer @entity53 travelled to @entity58 to document the lives and talents of each resident			1
one 50 - year - old woman , @entity23 , stares stoically at the camera as she performs her act : balancing a five - foot vase on her head			2
practice : children , like 15 - year - old @entity69 ( left ) and 12 - year - old @entity70 ( right ) , spend hours every day rehearsing skills such as stilt walking and drumming hub : @entity74 , 65 ( left ) , and @entity75 , 50 ( right ) are two of a number of puppeteers in the slum which has created a wave of creativity in the @entity9 region next door , @entity36 , 45 , pauses for a moment to pose with his two monkeys as he rehearses taming them			1
nearby , an entire family , the @entity87 , have formed a joint act as musicians , and spend their days singing and dancing			0
@entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity14 are all painters			0
their tiny room is splattered with paint and decked with paintings of @entity98 figures			0
unusual : @entity99 , 65 ( left ) , is a chair maker and @entity100 , 65 ( right ) , makes herbal medicine - both recognised forms of street performance residents like singer @entity105 , 45 , ( left ) and @entity106 , who creates textile art ( right ) , will be forced to make way for a new block of flats and a mall in the area dressed up : they spend the little money they have on outfits and instruments			1
@entity118 , 34 ( left ) , is a magician , and @entity119 , 19 ( right ) , is a drummer other professions include toy elephant makers , herbal medicines doctors - a recognised street act - and drummers			2
the @entity125 is said to have the largest single concentration of street artists in the world			0
the graduate photographer knew he wanted to work on a substantial body of work abroad			0
he began to research charities that he could volunteer with , as he knew as a volunteer he would be given immediate access and local contacts			0
makeshift : @entity137 , 18 , is one of just a few so - called longmen in the colony , using stilts made from piece of wood and rope musicians : @entity54 photographer @entity53 went to stay with the community to capture their talents and met the @entity33 family of musicians ' i began looking globally for these opportunities , and then refined my choices down to charities that could accommodate me as a photographer			1
' in the end it was a throw up between @entity58 and @entity155			0
i decided to go with @entity58 after looking at the slum the charity operated in			0
' he explains that his project became very focused on the street performers who live in the slum			1
' initially i was just there to meet and get to know people while trying to adjust to the culture , i wanted to create formal portraits of slum residents alongside this			0
' however after a few days in the slum there was no doubt in my mind that i had to make a formal set of portraits of the performers			0
i knew that the slum was famous for having street performers in it , but i do n't think i was prepared for the world 's largest concentration of street performers ! '			1

@entity12 colony of 2,800 families are all street performers living in collection of @entity9 slums
fears creative hub will be wiped out as government plans to build block of flats and mall over it
@entity54 photographer captures pictures of acts - from puppeteers to monkey tamers and acrobats
