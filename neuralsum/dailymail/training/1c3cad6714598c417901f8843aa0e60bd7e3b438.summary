by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:07 est , 28 february 2014 they come into your garden at night			1
you may not see them , but they are there			1
they are generally shy , but if you shine a torch you may catch their eyes staring back at you before they slink off into the darkness			1
they are intelligent and cunning , so much so that they are traditionally described as sly			1
they steal items left lying about – gardening gloves , a shoe , a piece of clothing – and then chew their swag for the apparent pleasure of destruction			1
and there ’s very little , if anything , that you can do about them			1
these lines may sound like the beginning of a horror story – or a moral panic – but they are a description of that most familiar resident of our countryside and our towns – the fox			1
the fox has divided the country in those who worry about its welfare and those who see it as a pest most of us have known him for a long time			1
he was there in our childhood in @entity52			1
then he appeared as a hero in @entity55 ’s @entity54 , where he outwits the farmers @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
he was a hero , too , in @entity60			1
but more often he is a villain			2
is there any animal in this country which divides opinion like the fox ? the supporters love him ; the detractors want him somewhere else , or shot , starved out , gassed or hunted by packs of dogs			1
both groups have an equal distaste for one another			2
many of the fox ’s enemies live in towns and cities			2
they object to their gardens being excavated			2
they dislike the smell he sometimes leaves behind when he marks his territory			2
they do n’t like the way he scatters their rubbish in the course of his scavenging			2
they fear he may even bite them or their cats or babies			2
@entity55 's @entity54 represents the fox as both cunning and charming and , some might say , with good reason			2
in 2010 , nine - month - old @entity98 and @entity99 were mauled in their cot by a fox in @entity102 , east @entity103			1
last year , another @entity103 couple , @entity104 and @entity105 , both suffered bite wounds trying to rescue their cat from the jaws of a fox			2
then there are the farmers			2
foxes eat their lambs and chickens , which , quite understandably , enrages them			1
they believe he should be kept under control though hunting , and they tend to resent the interference of townspeople in what they regard as a country affair			2
for many the urban fox has become more than just a pest but a menace with several cases of children being mauled by the animal a familiar scene : urban foxes are known for ripping open bin bags when scavenging for food this causes temperatures to rise perhaps more than any other issue in the politics of the countryside			1
the issue of fox - hunting has become more than a simple animal welfare one			1
the argument has become ideologically mixed up with the politics of class			2
toffs go fox hunting , argue some , let ’s stop them			2
i do not like fox - hunting and like many , i would not care to engage in it , as i feel sympathy for the quarry , but this crude attitude shows a real ignorance of how people live in the countryside , and is symptomatic of a more widespread lack of understanding in urban @entity159 of country life and the things it does			1
so much for @entity163 ’s enemies ; now for the friends			2
there is the vaguely approving householder who is tickled by the thought that there is a wild animal in his garden			1
@entity0 says he disagrees with fox hunting then , going up the scale of admiration , one encounters the passionate friends of the fox			2
these are the people who are all for helping the fox in what they see as his struggle for survival			2
you can , if you wish , adopt a fox with one of the animal charities , for which you will receive a certificate of adoption and a stuffed toy in the shape of a fox			1
then there are the people who are prepared to resort to disruption to protect him : the hunt saboteurs			0
i became interested in foxes when i realised we had one			1
of course you never own a wild animal , but you may feel you do when you discover your garden is their territory			1
our fox could be seen regularly parading about on the lawn or walking along the top of the garden wall , which he used as a sort of raised highway			0
he appeared by day or by night , but seemed to prefer the small hours of the morning			0
@entity0 says his garden fox was never a nuisance for him if he saw you watching him , he might pause and look back at you briefly before continuing with his journey			0
he did not seem particularly concerned about being spotted , although there was always a certain furtiveness about his movements			0
he travelled , i decided , in the style of one who knew that he was on somebody ’s wanted list			0
he was never a nuisance – although he occasionally dug in flower - beds			1
his excavations , though , were small , and easily filled in			0
sometimes he yowled in a blood - curdling way and rather human way , especially late at night , leading us to believe that somebody was being murdered nearby			1
my main concern was for our tonkinese cat			0
i thought that if the cat met the fox , the fox , being a sort of dog , would go for him			0
in fact , as i discovered , it was quite the reverse			0
a fox might take a kitten , perhaps , but would be unlikely to attack a fully - grown cat			1
cats have claws and teeth and can defend themselves very effectively against a fox			0
as far as foxes are concerned , cats are to be avoided			1
one night i saw exactly what happens when a cat meets a fox			0
the meeting happened on our garden wall , with the fox going in one direction and coming up against our cat going in the opposite direction			0
the result of this meeting was the most ear - shattering howling from the fox , who screamed blue murder over feline intransigence			1
the cat refused to give way , but stood his ground until the fox , after several minutes of outraged protest , turned tail and made off			0
victory to my fearless tonkinese			0
' a fox might take a kitten , perhaps , but would be unlikely to attack a fully - grown cat			1
as far as foxes are concerned , cats are to be avoided			1
' if even my domestic cat can see off a fox , then why are they hated by so many ? yes , they can make a bit of a mess , but so do seagulls			0
yes , they may be noisy , but that is only likely to be in a few months of the year when they are interested in breeding			0
yes , they may take lambs and chickens , but it is not the urban fox that does that , but the rural fox - and that does n’t explain the indiscriminate persecution of foxdom in general			1
in my @entity301 novels , about a formidable lady philosopher living in @entity299 , i have made one of the characters an urban fox			0
he frequents @entity301 ’s garden			0
he lurks under her rhododendron bushes			0
every so often she sees him and he sees her , and there passes between them a moment if not of understanding , then of appraisal			0
she calls him brother @entity312 and spends time wondering what goes on in his mind			0
for many the fox is a creature that needs protecting rather than exterminating that , of course , is more than idle speculation			0
trying to imagine what an animal thinks , or even just feels , is a valuable way of reminding ourselves of how we relate to nature			1
i remember being in @entity328 a few years ago and being taken into the mountains to see the great mountain gorillas			0
the gorillas walked right past us in the jungle , seemingly indifferent to our presence			0
then , one turned and looked at me			0
for a short time i looked into the dark eyes of the gorilla – he held my gaze and i held his			0
and i wondered how he saw me			0
what was i to him ? look into the eyes of a fox and ask yourself the same question			0
what does he see ? the answer may be unsettling			0
