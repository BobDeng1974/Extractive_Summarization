a woman endured the nightmare of waking on an operating table after hospital staff failed to check she had had enough anaesthetic			1
@entity5 , 36 , came round with tubes down her throat and her eyes taped shut as doctors prepared to remove her appendix			1
but mrs @entity5 could not move or alert doctors as the drugs she had been given had paralysed her , but could hear them speaking and prodding her stomach			1
@entity5 says she woke up during surgery to remove her appendix and that she now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence the nurse from @entity19 in @entity20 , said the incident was so traumatic that she has suffered flashbacks , nightmares , panic attacks and anxiety issues ever since			1
she has now called on the @entity27 trust responsible to ensure lessons are learned from her ordeal			2
she has also won an undisclosed settlement after the @entity31 apologised and admitted that staff failed to check the levels on the anaesthetic machine - leaving her panicking and fearing for her life as she awoke while being prepared for surgery			1
mrs @entity5 , who lives with her husband @entity37 , 38 , and her four - year - old daughter , said she has struggled to return to work fully since the incident as she suffered from severe ptsd			1
her lawyers said the payout will now cover her lost earnings and the therapy she has needed to help her manage her ongoing psychological problems			2
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ the whole incident was terrifying			1
the body is n't prepared to be awake in those situations , i had tubes in my mouth and my eyes were taped up - i was hysterical with panic but completely unable to do anything about it			1
mrs @entity5 believes the incident occurred because staff at the @entity31 failed to check if there was enough of the anaesthetic drug still in the machine administering it ‘ i thought i was in surgery already and i felt like i was going to die			1
‘ afterwards i tried to explain to the staff what happened but felt that i was being fobbed off with excuses and was constantly given the wrong information - first it was hallucinations , then it was a faulty machine			2
‘ it was incredibly distressing to find out that this was all caused by somebody not checking the machine actually had gas in it			2
‘ when it first happened i was absolutely traumatised			2
i just hope improvements are made to the anaesthetic process so they do n't let this happen to anyone else - i would hate for people to suffer what i have			0
’ she added : ' my overriding memory is not being able to move , being paralysed			0
anaesthetics are used during tests and surgical procedures to induce sleep and to prevents pain and discomfort			1
general anaesthetics are used with the aim of leaving the patient completely unconscious and unaware of the procedure			0
anaesthetics work by blocking the signals sent along the nerves to the brain			0
these nerves are bundles of tiny fibres that use signals to pass information around the body			0
anaesthetics stop the nerve signals that keep people awake from reaching the brain			0
once it wears off , the person will regain consciousness and feeling will return			0
common side effects include nausea and vomiting , dizziness , feeling cold , headaches and other aches and pains			0
in very rare cases , they can cause anaphylactic shock , permanent paralysis and even death			0
several studies have also suggested that up to one or two patients in every 1,000 wake up during their operation			1
however , an audit for the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) and the @entity124 and @entity125 ( @entity126 ) revealed last year that the figure could be more like one in every 15,000			0
it is thought most cases involve the patient being aware when they are being prepared for the operation or when the operation itself has finished - rather than during the actual operation			1
this can occur because anaesthetists have to carefully balance giving a patient enough of the drug to put them to sleep without giving them so much it is harmful			1
' it felt like hours but it was probably about five minutes i was awake for			0
at that point i just thought i was going to die			0
' it was the most terrifying thing i 've ever experienced			0
from what i remember there were marking out with pens , but i thought they were starting to cut me up			0
' mrs @entity5 , who is now heavily pregnant , was first told by doctors at @entity31 ’s @entity153 she needed her appendix removed in september 2010 after suffering from abdominal pains whilst working as a psychiatric nurse			1
on the day of surgery , which took place at @entity31 , she was taken to the anaesthetic room and told she would be put to sleep and that she should count backwards from 10			1
she said she remembers starting to count , but then believes she must have fallen asleep as the next thing she remembers is being wide awake while hospital staff were working around her , preparing for surgery			1
her eyes were taped over , she had breathing tubes in her throat and , believing she had woken up mid-surgery , she began to panic as she could hear machines beeping and hear the medical personnel talking around her			1
she tried to alert the staff but she was unable to move because the drugs staff had administered paralysed her and she could hear them speaking about her size and weight			1
she then felt someone poking and prodding at her abdomen before there was a shout for more morphine and she fell back asleep			1
a @entity180 by the hospital later concluded that it was human error in not checking a vaporiser , which was empty , rather than a fault on the machine			2
the anaesthetist subsequently wrote to mrs @entity5 to apologise and the @entity31 admitted they were at fault and that she had suffered ' anaesthetic awareness '			1
@entity190 , an expert medical lawyer at @entity191 , said : ‘ what happened to @entity193 is totally unacceptable			0
this was supposed to be a routine surgical procedure and she should have woken up after surgery safe in the knowledge that everything had gone well and she would make a full recovery			2
‘ instead she woke up paralysed , thinking that she was actually in theatre and thinking that she was about to die			2
‘ she was left distraught over what had happened and why she had effectively woken up			0
‘ the experience has had a massive effect on @entity193 psychologically			0
she put her trust in @entity27 staff but sadly on this occasion she was let down			2
‘ it is crucial that the @entity31 learns from this mistake and ensures that it can not happen again			0
‘ this was not a faulty machine			0
this was a simple avoidable human error and it is crucial that systems are introduced to stop this happening again			0
’ mrs @entity5 was off work for a few months , eventually returning to work in january 2011 , as she sought help for her ptsd			1
mrs @entity5 has now received compensation from the hospital trust to cover her lost earnings and to pay for her post-traumatic stress disorder treatment			1
image shows the @entity31 she then had to learn to cope with panic attacks and feelings of anxiety on a daily basis			1
throughout her recovery @entity230 has suffered a number of relapses which have left her unable to work for a time			2
dr @entity234 , interim executive medical director at @entity31 , said : ' we are very sorry for the distress experienced by ms @entity5			1
' we are pleased that a settlement has now been agreed and procedures have been put in place to reduce the chance of this happening again			2
