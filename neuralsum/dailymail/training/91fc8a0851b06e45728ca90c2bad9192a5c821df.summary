’ there was no physical evidence connecting @entity6 to the crime and no corroborating testimony			2

the state knew … but did n’t disclose it			0
’ a willing walk to @entity93 : @entity9 trusted the men who told him he was going to see @entity95 but abducted and shot him dead with barely concealed outrage @entity49 added : ‘ no civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy evidence , quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness , to decide whether to take someone ’s life or liberty			1
’ state attorney @entity105 last week pressed the court to deny bond on the grounds that the evidence was ‘ no different now ’ than on the day of @entity6 ’s conviction 23 years ago			1
if granted at all , mr @entity110 requested the court set @entity6 ’s bond at $ 5million			2

in a statement seen by @entity5 and submitted by @entity121 , to @entity122 , she said : ‘ in view of judge @entity49 ’s @entity125 , it becomes less and less bearable what the @entity21 of @entity126 is putting us through			0

’ @entity148 , 4 , begged his mother to take hiim to the mall to see @entity95 , instead she sent him with @entity152 and sent him to his death convicted @entity154 : @entity152 , left , and @entity155 , right are both facing lethal injection for their crime judge @entity49 has set aside not only the conviction but has also barred the use of the ' so - called confession			1
' the facts of the case , such as they were known , were enough to shock @entity164			0
on the last evening of his life , @entity165 saw @entity95 at the mall near the home in @entity64 he shared with his mother and her room - mate @entity152			0
he enjoyed it so much he woke the next morning and begged his mother to take him again			0
@entity6 , then 25 , agreed but asked @entity152 to take him instead			2
on the way @entity152 picked up his friend @entity155			0

in the immediate aftermath @entity155 implicated @entity6			2
he claimed the three had plotted @entity165 ’s killing and planned to split his $ 50,000 life insurance			0
corrupt witness : @entity64 police detective @entity16 ' lied under oath and trampled over suspects rights , ' and his testimony convicted @entity6 @entity9 's family mourn where the little boy was shot and his body abandoned if looks could kill : prosecutors argued that @entity6 murdered her son because of his resemblance to his father , the ex-husband she loathed , @entity200 , above left much was made in trial of @entity6 ’s hatred for @entity9 ’s father , her ex-husband , @entity204 and @entity9 ’s striking physical resemblance to him			1
but neither of @entity6 ’s co-accused took the stand at the original trial			2
@entity152 has vociferously maintained that @entity6 had nothing to do with the killing that shocked @entity164 , while @entity155 recanted his earlier claims			2
speaking to @entity5 , @entity6 ’s @entity64 based attorney , @entity213 said : ‘ we have learned from various sources that @entity152 and @entity155 continue to maintain that @entity6 had nothing to do with the killing			0
’ both men , he said , have the added incentive of having their death penalties reduced to life sentences if they turn @entity21 witnesses			0
yet both continue to maintain @entity6 ’s innocence			0
@entity6 ’s retrial will start on 30 september .			1
