by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 17:30 est , 28 june 2012 @entity2 attorney general @entity1 was found in contempt of @entity4 on thursday as the @entity6 - controlled @entity5 sanctioned the nation 's top law enforcement official for withholding some documents related to a failed gun - running probe			1
the mostly partisan vote of 255 - 67 marked the first time a sitting attorney general and presidential cabinet member was cited for contempt by the @entity16			1
no @entity18 vote will be necessary in this @entity16 contempt citation			1
while 17 @entity21 backed the censure , many refused to cast votes and @entity21 leader @entity24 led many of her colleagues in a walkout from the @entity16 floor in protest			1
@entity1 addresses the 83rd @entity30 on june 28 , 2012 in @entity31 , @entity32			2
the @entity5 has voted today on a contempt of @entity4 charge against @entity1 following the vote holding him in contempt of @entity4 , @entity1 , speaking from @entity38 railed against what he called ' truly absurd conspiracy theories '			1
' i had hoped that @entity4 leaders would be good - faith partners in this work , ' said @entity1			1
others , however , have devoted their time and energy to [ creating political theater ] and truly absurd – truly absurd – conspiracy theories			0
' in a previous statement he had made in @entity32 , @entity1 was equally scathing			2
' today ’s vote may make for good political theater in the minds of some , but it is — at base — both a crass effort and a grave disservice to the @entity2 people			2
they expect — and deserve — far better , ' said @entity1 on thursday evening			2
the @entity63 also issued a statement , condemning the contempt vote as a political gesture			2
' unfortunately , a politically - motivated agenda prevailed and instead of engaging with the president in efforts to create jobs and grow the economy , today we saw the @entity5 perform a transparently political stunt , ' said the @entity63 this evening			1
later in the day , the @entity16 also was scheduled to vote on a resolution asking @entity2 courts to force @entity1 to turn over documents being sought by the @entity77 as part of its long - running investigation of the @entity81			1
the attorney general said that he had taken steps to ' facilitate robust congressional oversight ' and that he had tried to work with @entity86 chairman @entity85 and his allies			0
' my efforts to resolve this matter short of such a battle were rebuffed by @entity92 and his supporters			0
it ’s clear that they were not interested in bringing an end to this dispute or obtaining the information they claimed to seek			0
ultimately , their goal was the vote that — with the help of special interests — they now have engineered , ' said @entity1			2
that could lead to a prolonged court fight with an uncertain outcome while a judge weighed the @entity16 demand against the @entity114 administration 's claim of executive privilege to protect the documents			1
the unprecedented @entity16 rebuke of @entity1 was overshadowed by the @entity2 @entity119 's upholding of @entity21 president @entity114 's controversial healthcare law - a ruling that was reverberating throughout the country			1
nevertheless , the @entity16 devoted much of its legislative session on thursday to a sometimes bitter debate over @entity1 's role in ' @entity81 , ' which was aimed at following guns being purchased in @entity127 to determine whether they flowed into @entity129 for use by drug cartels			1
from left , @entity16 minority whip @entity132 and @entity16 minority leader @entity24 right , and many @entity16 @entity21 walk out of the @entity134 during the vote to hold attorney general @entity1 in contempt the @entity137 initially denied that a program was being run that allowed some guns to ' walk ' into @entity129 - a contention it later retracted , raising @entity6 suspicions			1
according to government figures , between 2007 - 2011 , of 99,000 firearms recovered in @entity129 and submitted to @entity2 law enforcement , more than 68,000 came from the @entity2			2
in recent years , those weapons have shifted more and more from handguns to high - powered rifles			0
by early 2011 , @entity81 had been terminated after disclosures that federal agents had lost track of many of the high - powered weapons , which subsequently were traced to crimes , including the murder of a @entity2 @entity157 agent			2
@entity16 @entity6 and @entity21 have engaged in arguments all year over issues ranging from budget and taxes to contraceptives			1
thursday 's debate was no exception			0
attorney general @entity1 speaks at the @entity165 in @entity31 , @entity32			0
this is the first time a sitting @entity168 member has been held in contempt			1
@entity85 representative @entity85 , the chairman of the @entity77 , called the @entity127 law enforcement operation ' reckless			0
' @entity85 added the contempt vote was being held ' because when we asked legitimate questions ... about @entity81 , we were lied to			0
we were lied to repeatedly and over a 10 - month period			0
' @entity24 accused @entity6 of using the election - year contempt charge to undermine @entity1 's efforts to combat voter suppression in some states			1
' this is something that makes a witch hunt look like a day at the beach , ' @entity24 told reporters			0
' it is a railroading of a ( contempt ) resolution that is unsubstantiated by the facts			0
' the tussle between the @entity114 administration and @entity16 @entity6 is over the release of a series of documents dating from february 4 , 2011 , when the @entity137 initially denied that guns were being allowed to ' walk ' into @entity129			1
the dispute is both legal and political			0
republicans asserted their right to obtain documents needed for an investigation of @entity81 — focusing on 10 months in 2011 after the @entity114 administration initially denied guns were allowed to ' walk ' from @entity127 to @entity129			0
by year 's end , the administration acknowledged the assertion was wrong			0
president @entity114 asserted a broad form of executive privilege , a legal position designed to keep executive branch documents from being disclosed			1
the assertion ensures that documents will not be turned over any time soon , unless a deal is reached between the administration and congressional @entity6			0
in debate , however , republicans framed the issue as the need for closure for the family of @entity157 , a @entity157 agent killed in december 2010 in a shootout with @entity129 bandits			0
two guns from @entity81 were found at the scene			0
democrats said the contempt issue was a political stunt to embarrass the @entity114 administration in an election year , and added that holding the attorney general in contempt will do nothing to bring closure to @entity157 's family			2
for the past year and a half , some @entity6 have promoted the idea that @entity1 and other top - level officials at the @entity137 knew federal agents in @entity81 had engaged in gun - walking			1
attorney general @entity1 testifies on @entity240 in @entity241			0
in email exchanges with subordinates in february and march 2011 , attorney general @entity1 expressed concern that something might have gone wrong in @entity81 two of @entity1 's emails and one from deputy attorney general @entity249 in early 2011 appear to show that they had n't known about gun - walking but were determined to find out whether the allegations were true			2
" we need answers on this			0
real answers , " @entity1 wrote			0
the @entity137 showed the e-mails on tuesday to @entity6 and @entity21 staffers of the @entity258 , whose chairman is rep. @entity85 , @entity260 , in an effort to ward off the criminal contempt vote against the attorney general			1
the full contents of the emails were described to @entity265 by two people who have seen them			0
both people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about them publicly			0
@entity1 has refused to turn over these and other communications unless the oversight panel dropped its subpoena for the records — a condition unacceptable to @entity85			2
the department withdrew the feb. 4 letter denying gun walking took place on dec. 2 , 2011 , after documenting what had taken place not only in @entity81 , but in three other gun - walking operations going back to 2006			0
in @entity81 , agents of the federal @entity284 in abandoned the agency 's usual practice of intercepting all weapons they believed to be illicitly purchased			0
instead , the goal of the tactic known as " gun - walking " was to track such weapons to high - level arms traffickers who had eluded prosecution and to dismantle their networks			0
gun - walking long has been barred by @entity137 policy , but federal agents in @entity127 experimented with it in at least two investigations during the @entity301 administration before @entity81			0
the agents in @entity127 lost track of several hundred weapons in that operation			0
under pressure : the censure of attorney general @entity1 ( pictured ) , in which a number of @entity21 are poised to join @entity6 , is a major embarrassment for president @entity114 the high - stakes fight could jeopardize the jobs of some top @entity137 officials if @entity4 ultimately finds that they were hiding some important information related to @entity81			1
conversely , @entity6 could be embarrassed if nothing turns up and they devoted so much time and energy amid the need to help the struggling @entity2 economy - the top priority of voters in the run - up to the november 6 presidential and congressional elections			1
the @entity325 , a powerful lobbying organization that opposes gun regulation , has made the @entity1 contempt move a top priority			1
it has warned all 435 @entity16 members that a vote against the contempt citation would be a black mark against them			1
@entity6 @entity85 testifies to the @entity333 about a proposed vote to find @entity2 attorney general @entity1 in contempt of @entity4 during a hearing on @entity240 in @entity241 on june 27 the @entity325 has argued that @entity81 was actually a back - door move by the @entity114 administration to lay the ground for new gun regulations by the @entity284 , which ran the southwest border gun - running investigation			1
@entity114 administration officials point out that the @entity137 already has released more than 7,000 documents to @entity85 's committee and that they showed that top officials in @entity241 initially knew little about @entity81 , which was hatched by law enforcement officials in @entity127			2
@entity16 @entity21 , meanwhile , have complained that @entity85 has rejected their calls to investigate @entity301 administration gun probes similar to @entity81			2
house speaker @entity349 of @entity350 ( left ) defended the decision to find @entity1 in contempt while @entity6 @entity353 ( right ) is seen testifying to the @entity333 the fight between @entity6 and @entity1 escalated last week , after the @entity63 exerted ' executive privilege ' over the post-february 4 , 2011 , documents , saying they were protected communications that any administration needs as part of its deliberative process			1
@entity85 's committee , in a partisan vote last week , charged @entity1 with contempt after negotiations to resolve the dispute failed			1
@entity16 @entity6 leaders immediately announced that the full @entity16 debate and vote would come quickly			1
while contempt of @entity4 charges generally are aimed at forcing officials to produce information to @entity4 , legal experts point out that they are very hard to enforce and the action could bring months or years of litigation and stalemate .			2

the @entity6 - controlled @entity5 voted 255 - 67 in favor of finding @entity1 in contempt of @entity4
no sitting @entity168 member had ever been found in contempt by @entity4 before today
100 @entity21 led by @entity384 members , as well as @entity16 minority leader @entity24 walked out and refused to vote
overshadowed the @entity2 @entity119 's upholding of president @entity114 's controversial healthcare law
