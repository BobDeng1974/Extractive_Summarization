' political pressure ' : @entity1 , who accused the @entity2 of ' incompetence ' after they failed to show his documentary the @entity2 has been accused of ' political naiveté ' after dropping a controversial documentary which called into question the mass exile of @entity10 people from @entity11 in @entity12 after their failed uprising against the @entity14			1
the one - hour programme , @entity11 : an @entity16 , was due to air on @entity17 last week but was scrapped at the last minute			1
film maker @entity1 accused the @entity2 of ' incompetence ' and suggested they succumbed to ' conscious or subconscious political pressure ' after they decided not to broadcast it			1
in a blog post , mr @entity1 said the decision to axe the programme was : ' ultimately a sad saga of what i believe is a mixture of incompetence , political naiveté , conscious or subconscious political pressure and , i believe , a lack of courage of broadcasters when they are faced with the complexity of the @entity37 issue and the intense emotions , fears and aggression it generates			1
' the @entity10 were expelled from @entity11 following an uprising against the @entity14 , with hundreds of thousands killed and many more sent into exile			2
after the revolt there were still pockets of @entity10 left living in @entity11 , but the centre of gravity for the @entity10 people shifted to the @entity50			2
a @entity52 preview said the documentary , which questioned the scale of the exile , would have ' severe ramifications for relations in the region '			0
dr @entity59 , a @entity60 senior lecturer in early jewish studies , said the decision to axe the programme was ' strange ' , given the @entity2 's past record of airing controversial documentaries			1
and angry viewers took to the magazine 's website to accuse the corporation of ' pandering to a small interest group			2

' and @entity79 added : ' ridiculous pandering to a small interest group ! the @entity2 used to ask the tough questions ...			2
. now they cower in fear due to some fundamentalist zionists whose world vision is as warped as any other fundamentalist religious group			0
' controversial documentary : @entity11 : an @entity16 questioned whether the @entity10 exile from @entity11 in @entity12 ever happened the @entity2 denied that the film had been dropped because it was controversial and said it ' did not fit editorially ' with a series of historical archeology films			1
however , @entity94 - born mr @entity1 claimed a ' mini political storm was brewing ' at @entity96 in the days before the documentary was due to broadcast			1
he claims he was told that the programme was ' delayed ' in going out because he had not had enough time to review the final cut of his longer 104 - minute film			2
television viewers were angry after the @entity2 scrapped the documentary which was one of the @entity52 ' picks of the day			1
viewers accused the corporation of pandering to small interest groups			2
they wrote on the @entity52 website : @entity79 wrote : ' ridiculous pandering to a small interest group ! the @entity2 used to ask the tough questions ...			2

' @entity119 said : ' i agree with these comments , it looks like this show was pulled at the last minute to please some unnamed pressure group			0
how come unnamed groups get to dictate who and what we watch ? ? ? ? ? ? ' @entity128 added : ' @entity129 said that , when joining the @entity2 , one has the " organs of opinion formally removed "			0
now i wonder if he got right what organs are removed ... ' @entity72 said : ' furious this has been pulled ! after all the fuss last about how " public interest arguments " for showing flagship documentary on @entity77 will be vehemently defended , but why is this quietly removed ? ' @entity138 wrote : ' the pulling of this programme reeks of censorship			0
' he described the situation as : ' a saga of well meaning programming executives who acquired the “ courageous “ film they claim to love , believing that they can sneak it by with a “ neutral title ”			0
' when they were “ caught ” , rather than face the criticism and be helped by the mountains of documents and dates i was ready to send them , they panicked like deer in the headlights not knowing what to do and eventually raised their hands in resignation			0
' dr @entity59 said he was surprised that the @entity2 had decided to axe the show			1
‘ although i have not seen the film , it would appear that the maker is not saying anything new - everyone knows that @entity10 continued to live in the @entity170 after @entity12 , ' he said			0
' but if the film maker is trying to argue that today 's @entity173 are directly descended from the first century @entity10 inhabitants of @entity175 , then his argument is deeply flawed and far too simplistic			1
' having said that , given their past record , it is precisely the sort of argument i would have expected the @entity2 to broadcast , so their decision is strange either way			1
' after all , it is not like the @entity2 has n't broadcast documentaries showing controversial points of view before			1
' indeed , it often seems like , to get a documentary on the @entity2 , you have to be saying something a bit bizarre or controversial - they are not really interested in the more solid , mundane or rigorous aspects of scholarship			2
’ blog post : @entity1 accused the @entity2 of ' incompetence ' and suggested they succumbed ' conscious or subconscious political pressure ' in this post after they axed his documentary a @entity52 review of the programme said ' archeology is politics in the @entity37 '			1
the reviewer added : ' the precarious balance of @entity205 , @entity10 and @entity207 holy sites in the ancient heart of @entity11 is informed as much by what ’s below ground as what ’s above			0
' which is why evidence revealed here , suggesting that the @entity10 exile from @entity11 in ad 70 may never have actually happened , has such severe ramifications for relations in the region			0
' the @entity2 showed a repeat of a documentary about egyptologist @entity221 last thursday evening instead			2
a spokesman for the @entity2 today said they may show mr @entity1 's programme in the future			1
' we originally acquired @entity11 : an @entity16 to supplement @entity17 's season exploring the history of archaeology , ' he said			1
' however , it was decided that it did not fit editorially so we did not show the programme as part of the season			1
any future transmissions are under review			0
' analysis by dr @entity59 , senior lecturer in early jewish studies , @entity60 @entity10 exodus : painting of the destruction of @entity11 in @entity241 by @entity242 the ‘ @entity245 ’ was a @entity10 revolt against @entity14 rule in the @entity170			1
it lasted around four years from ad66 to ad70 , culminating with the conquest of @entity11 and destruction of the @entity249			0
initially , the @entity14 suffered incredible losses , among the most costly the @entity251 ever experienced , which explains the level of retribution they meted out			0
it is estimated that @entity14 losses were at least 20,000 , while @entity10 losses numbered in the hundreds of thousands , with many more sold into slavery			0
after this war , the centre of gravity for the @entity10 nation moved steadily further away from @entity11 , ending up to the north in the @entity50			0
the historicity of these events is not disputed and is agreed upon by the three main monotheistic religions – @entity267 , @entity207 and @entity268			0
the theological interpretations of these events may differ , but there ’s no argument about the events themselves .			0
