for more than a minute , he sits back , lies on the windscreen and even kicks his legs in the air			1
crazy : the performer splays his legs in the air and lies back on the windscreen with seemingly no fear for his life no fear : in a final demonstration of bravado , the man kneels up on the bonnet and leans his elbows on the roof of the car man overboard : as the camera approaches the man is clearly visible sitting on the front of the car the car has to move over as traffic begins to build up , but in a final death - defying stunt the man turns around and kneels up with arms on the roof			1
