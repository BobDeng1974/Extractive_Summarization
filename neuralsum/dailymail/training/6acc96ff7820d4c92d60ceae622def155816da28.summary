she 's the poised presence on the @entity2 sofa , a controversial champion of early motherhood and the woman who kept it together in the face of some truly harrowing tales in a @entity10 refugee camp			1
as well as being one of the queens of breakfast tv , @entity11 is known for her stint presenting @entity16 and for cuddling up to @entity17 - all in the name of work			1
' he was absolutely lovely , ' she gushed in an interview with @entity22 : ' he 's just had a new baby and he was talking really sweetly about [ his wife and child ]			1
all natural : @entity11 says she would n't rule @entity27 out but is happy with a thick fringe for now ' lovely ! ' one interviewee who did n't get a grilling was @entity31 actor @entity17 ' most people are nice really , ' she adds			1
' my job is all about meeting people who , whether they 're the prime minister or @entity37 , have all done something extraordinary			0
' @entity11 is no slouch in the out - of - the - ordinary stakes herself			1
at 46 , she 's done and seen it all , from covering the signing of the @entity43 for the @entity44 to settling down on the @entity46 sofa with @entity47			1
it would , you 'd imagine , be near - impossible to shake that determined calm , although @entity11 says since she became a mother , things have become a little more challenging			1
' there 's good and bad [ days ] , ' she says , candidly			1
' it 's been a challenge this summer because the kids are off and i worked every day			2
' it has taken extreme organisation , and that 's something i 'm really not good at ! i wanted them to have good holiday but had to balance it with work too			2
' @entity11 's children , eight - year - old @entity66 and four - year - old @entity67 , are the axis around which her world revolves and she made headlines recently when she revealed that she wished she had had them earlier			1
controversially , she also suggested that women should have children earlier , despite having her own at the ages of 38 and 42			0
speaking to @entity77 on the @entity78 , she added : ' if i 'd discovered motherhood earlier i 'd have a huge brood			2
but i fell pregnant at 38 and 42			0
but then when i tried for a third child and they told me i was 44 , and i realised i was ignorant as to how lucky i was the first times			0
' we should n't get into a panic			2
nobody wants women marrying the wrong man or having babies when they are n't ready , but you are hedging your bets if you leave it too late			2
' despite the controversy , she seems content and is happy to regale with anecdotes , including a morning spent struggling into @entity97 while her bemused brood looked on			0
poised : @entity11 is known for always keeping her cool - even when dealing with @entity99 in his bedroom ' i was getting ready them ready for school today and then i had to go straight off to meet the lovely @entity17 , ' she laughs			1
' i was in my @entity104 though and all they [ the children ] were asking me was " what 's that ? " i told them that they 'll understand they have two children			2
' there a lot of tricks nowadays , thank the @entity115 ! and luckily , most people do n't expect you to look like a supermodel either			2
' here , she 's touched on an interesting topic			2
the tv world is notorious for shedding female presenters once they reach their 40s and 50s as former @entity125 presenter @entity124 alleged when she took the @entity44 to court for unfair dismissal			0
so does she feel under pressure to look good ? ' it 's strange because friends tell me there are these issues in tv but personally , i 'm surrounded by women on and off screen who are older so have n't come across it , ' she says			1
' you have got to deal with those things on a personal basis i think but then i look at the @entity142 where there are lots of amazing older women like [ @entity147 's ] @entity146 and it makes you more hopeful			0
' most important : @entity11 says her much - wanted family is what really gets her up in the mornings no surgery : @entity11 and her @entity44 counterpart @entity153 , 49 , have kept their complexions the natural way even so , there 's surely still pressure to look good			1
would she ever consider having botox or surgery ? ' i 'd never say never about any of those things			0
i have friends [ who have had cosmetic work ] who look amazing but i 've also interviewed people who look terrible			0
' [ presenter ] @entity153 has said absolutely no and still looks amazing			0
sometimes natural is best , although i 've got a really thick fringe which is the coward 's way out ! ' she might be a ' coward ' when it comes to cosmeceuticals but she 's no softie when it comes to questioning the flow of politicians and a-listers that stream through the @entity2 studios			1
' i hope i 'm always fair and if they did ask me not to mention something specific , i would n't do it , ' she says of her sofa interviewing style			1
' it 's slightly different with politicians because questions you 're asking are about things that affect all our lives , so i sort of feel they deserve tougher questions			0
' essentially , the whole point is to get a sense of what makes someone tick			0
i just want to get an answer and as long [ the question ] is fair then it 's fine			0
' so what makes @entity11 herself tick ? ' caffeine and patriotism , sir ! i 'd really like to say that but it 's from a film called @entity31			1
' i think my family is obviously at my heart , because i 've always wanted to have one , and my wider family			0
that would always be my first choice			0
' @entity11 is an ambassador for @entity207 ’ report			1
