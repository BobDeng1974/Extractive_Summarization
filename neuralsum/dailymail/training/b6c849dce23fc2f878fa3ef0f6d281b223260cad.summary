the goalkeeper who has been outwitted throughout the afternoon by a child with a pack of cards is discussing tricks of the mind			0
he hopes they might just stop the @entity8 ’s bigger kids from bullying @entity9 so mercilessly			1
‘ confidence ’ is @entity11 ’s buzzword , a term he often comes back to when discussing @entity9 ’s status and where they want to be			1
that destination is the @entity16			0
it was the missed target that cost @entity18 his job despite his ‘ great ’ work last season ; it might cost the club @entity11 next summer if they fail again to reach the top four			1
@entity11 has been superb for @entity9 since joining in 2012 but the club has struggled in that period @entity9 ' mediocre start to the season got worse on sunday with a 1 - 0 home defeat against @entity28 but that little step is also a major psychological leap , a progression that requires @entity9 to displace one of the clubs that routinely slaps them around			1
they play @entity35 tomorrow , having taken one point from nine games against @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity35 in the past year			1
in those extraordinary games , overseen by three managers , they have scored twice and conceded 30			2
when asked if points must now count double for @entity9 in games against their top - four rivals , @entity11 replies : ‘ yes			1
but we are in the @entity8 and it is the most difficult league to win in the world			1
there are five , six , seven top clubs which are able to win , or are at the same level as the champions in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			2
’ @entity11 says his team - mates must overcome the mental block that sometimes affects them in the big games last month @entity9 were battered 3 - 0 at home against @entity39			1
manager @entity60 responded with an angry debrief and an analysis session that saw him re-watch the tape 20 times			1
‘ what happened in the changing room stays in there , ’ says @entity11 in a lounge at @entity66			2
he has been warmly hosting young survivors of brain tumours as part of the @entity75 ’s get to know @entity74 campaign , one of whom has been tricking him with cards			0
@entity11 ’s poker face slips as he says : ‘ of course , when you get bad results the manager ’s job is to say the truth to the players			1
’ @entity39 comprehensively beat @entity9 3 - 0 at @entity66 earlier in the season the cold truth , in @entity11 ’s mind , is that not enough of @entity60 ’s squad have the mindset of winners			1
their challenge , he says , is to change that psyche while assimilating new players and a new manager and also meeting the club ’s targets			0
‘ i think we need time , ’ @entity11 says			2
‘ we are trying to go that way			0
i think it is important that there is confidence between players and manager and staff and we are still learning and trying to improve			0
‘ i am sure we will be ready in a few months			0
but it is strange to say we will be ready in a few months because we need to get points very quickly because the season has started and we have ambition and we need the most points possible			1
the @entity53 keeper has been impressed with new manager @entity60 who took over this summer ‘ when you go into a club , the first thing ( you find ) is tradition			2
this is the difference between the top clubs in @entity118 and @entity9			1
they are used to winning so when you are a new player in that club , in the changing room there are a lot of players who won a lot of titles			0
for that , we need to start with one trophy			0
‘ it ( confidence ) happens when you win and in the big games you win as well			1
but there is not only a league between top teams — you can lose points everywhere			1
’ there was too much of that last season , as @entity9 went from finishing fifth in 2012 - 13 — one point behind fourth - placed @entity35 — to sixth in 2013 - 14 , 10 points behind @entity141 ’s side			1
@entity11 says : ‘ it was a difficult season			1
for me it was the first time a manager was sacked during the season			2
‘ @entity18 did a great job			0
it was not easy for him , but he did it with passion for the club and he did well because you do n’t have time to put your project ( in place )			0
the season had started ( when he came in for @entity156 ) and you have to find the right solution			2
’ @entity9 lost three times to @entity159 rivals @entity35 last season , and they face them again on saturday the solution for @entity9 was pochettino			1
@entity11 — the 27 - year - old son of a @entity165 banker and whose late mother was a lawyer — was growing up in @entity53 when he first heard of the man who now manages him ‘ i watched him playing for @entity169 and @entity170 , and for @entity171 in the 2002 @entity172 , ’ he says			2
‘ in @entity169 he was captain , at @entity170 too			0
‘ he has this attitude every day			0
he is a young manager but he does n’t show it			0
he is very clear in his speaking			0
he has a presence and a proper concept of football			0
@entity11 said @entity18 did a ' great ' job last season , but it was not enough to get @entity9 into the top four ‘ the atmosphere is great			1
we are hungry , we want to improve , and we want to get better			0
we are just at the beginning			0
we have a lot to improve and show it as a team			2
but i think we can see the progress			0
’ perhaps , but as yet results have been modest			0
@entity11 signed a five - year deal in july , but as one of the best goalkeepers in the world he will again be a target next summer if @entity9 ca n’t meet their target and , therefore , fail to give him @entity16 football			1
@entity11 speaks to fans at the ‘ get to know cancer ’ event at @entity66 @entity11 and @entity201 show some fans around the @entity9 dressing room at the ‘ get to know cancer ’ event asked if his future is dependent on that , he says : ‘ i do n’t know			1
i ’m not thinking about that			0
i am just focused on my work and the club and i hope we can have a good reward at the end of the season			2
but nobody knows about the future of the club			0
of course , it is a big motivation to be back in the @entity16 with @entity9			2
’ a win over @entity35 and the setting of a new trend against the division ’s bully boys will help greatly			2
* @entity11 was speaking as part of @entity9 ’s ongoing support for the get to know cancer campaign , that aims to raise awareness of cancer and promote early diagnosis amongst the club ’s fans			1
this month , the focus is on raising awareness of brain tumours amongst young people , working in partnership with @entity237 .			0

@entity11 admits @entity9 need to be stronger in the big games
@entity9 lost three times against @entity35 last season and finished well outside the top four
@entity9 have taken one point from nine games against @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity35 in the past year
champions league *qualification* is @entity11 **'s** aim but @entity9 have started the season slowly
two defeats and a draw have left them *9th* in the @entity8 with seven points
@entity60 **'s** team face @entity35 at the @entity257 on saturday
