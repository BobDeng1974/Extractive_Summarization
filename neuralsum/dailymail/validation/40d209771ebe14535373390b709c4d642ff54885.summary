scientists at @entity1 have successfully used instruments to observe the total solar eclipse - in the hope of solving one of the sun ’s biggest mysteries			1
for some reason , the corona of the sun - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - is a lot hotter than the surface , and no one is sure why			1
but by observing the atmosphere of the sun around the eclipse , astronomers will be hoping to solve this mystery once and for all			0
using an array of instruments they studied the sun 's corona , plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse			1
they hope to work out why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface in a blog post , research student @entity37 from @entity38 , who is part of the team conducting the research , said that everything had gone as planned			1
‘ what a show ! @entity46 doors open , special glasses ready , cameras , all of us standing in the cold , waiting for the moment of truth , ’ she said			0
‘ those two minutes of eclipse time brought us all here and connected us			0
time to look at our data ! ’ a total solar eclipse is the only time that the entire atmosphere of the sun can be observed			1
why is the sun ’s corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface ? that is one of greatest solar mysteries , but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer today - by observing the total solar eclipse from the @entity73			1
the plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse , so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena			1
some @entity81 spacecraft have a ‘ coronograph ’ on board , which lets them block part of the sun and create an artificial eclipse , but the effect pales in comparison to viewing the atmosphere of the sun around the moon			0
at @entity1 , including fellow research student @entity93 from the university , measured radiation before , during and after the eclipse			1
they used a high - tech particle camera developed by the @entity99 programme to measure changes in radiation			0
@entity99 also provided similar detectors at schools across the @entity104 , to measure changes in radiation from the eclipse at varying degrees of totality			0
in @entity1 , 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon , but much further south in @entity111 , only about 85 per cent was obscured			0
and in an amazing coincidence , the eclipse occurred over @entity1 in the @entity73 on the same day the sun came into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years			2
the team at @entity1 ( shown ) , led by professor @entity117 , @entity118 at the @entity119 , included scientists from @entity38 in @entity121			2
they joined scientists from the @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 as part of the ' @entity127 ' in @entity1 , 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon ( start of the eclipse shown ) , but much further south in @entity111 , only about 85 per cent was obscured the scientists measured radiation before , during ( shown ) and after the eclipse			1
they used a high - tech particle camera developed by the @entity99 programme to measure changes in radiation shown is an image of 1999 's solar elcipse from @entity141 , with the corona visible around the edges the team of scientists worked at an old observatory on @entity1 , midway between continental @entity147 and the @entity73			1
they travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse			0
for observers in other regions , such as the @entity104 , less than 90 per cent of the sun was covered			0
the team at @entity1 , led by professor @entity117 , @entity118 at the @entity119 , included the scientists from @entity38 in @entity121			2
they joined scientists from the @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 as part of the ' @entity127 '			0
up to 14 specially adapted cameras were used to photograph the sun in different frequencies during the eclipse , capturing images of the plasma from the corona			2
in so doing , they will hope to solve the sun ’s greatest mystery			0
the temperature of the sun is known to be around 6,000 ° c ( 10,800 ° f ) , but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000 ° @entity173 ) , and even reaches @entity174 ( 3,600,000 ° f ) in some areas			0
this factor of 300 difference would be akin to the flame of a fire being 300 times colder than the air around it - but why this is occurring is unknown			2
one potential reason could be magnetic forces on the sun , with superheated gas creating a strong magnetic field and funnelling energy into the corona , but this has not yet been confirmed			0
the team of scientists worked at an old observatory on @entity1 , midway between continental @entity147 and the @entity73 ( shown with the red marker )			2
they travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse observations took place from the @entity203 in @entity1 , pictured			1
in a coincidence , the eclipse occurred over the @entity73 on the same day the sun came into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years data and images taken during the eclipse will be used to try and develop a mathematical model to understand this difference in temperature			0
' the difference between the temperature of the sun and that of the sun ’s corona is one of the great mysteries of astronomy , ’ said dr @entity222 , a reader at the @entity223 at @entity38 , who is overseeing the team ’s work from the @entity104			2
‘ a total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference			1
' he also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite - based communication systems from solar storms , which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. the temperature of the sun 's surface ( shown ion this @entity81 image ) is known to be around 6,000 ° @entity247 ) , but for some reason the corona is around @entity250 ( 1,800,000 ° f ) , and even reaches @entity251 ( 3,600,000 ° f ) in some areas , a factor of about 300			1

a team of scientists travelled to @entity1 to observe the solar eclipse using an array of instruments
they studied the sun 's corona , plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse
they hope to work out why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface , something that *remains* a mystery
with the *experiments* successful , they are now looking at their data , which includes measurements of radiation
