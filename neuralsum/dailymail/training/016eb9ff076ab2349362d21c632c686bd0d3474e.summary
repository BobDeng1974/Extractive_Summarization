by @entity1 reporter published : 20:22 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 : 20:22 est , 25 february 2014 hundreds of seabirds have been washed up along the south - west coast after dying of exhaustion in the recent storms			1
the bodies of almost 500 birds , mostly guillemots and razorbills , have been recovered from the beaches of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 after they perished at sea			1
experts at the @entity18 said consistent gale - force storms in the @entity20 during the past month had made it very hard for the creatures to hunt and feed			1
devastated : the bodies of almost 500 birds , mostly guillemots - like the one pictured in this stock image - and razorbills , have been recovered from the beaches of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 after they perished at sea the malnutrition coupled with flying in ferocious winds meant they became exhausted and died			1
birds fared even worse across the @entity20 , where 15,000 puffins were found dead on the shores of @entity34			1
the @entity35 for the @entity36 said the tragedy could have a devastating effect on the coming breeding season			0
the majority of the dead birds have washed up at sheltered @entity42 in @entity15 , having being swept across @entity43 by south westerly winds			1
some conservationists have claimed the birds have been killed by a pollutant similar to palm oil but this has been ruled out by the @entity18 ( dwt )			2
@entity50 , of the @entity18 , said : ' we have probably had 600 birds washed up along the south west coast over the last few days			1
' of these about 130 have been found alive and taken to an @entity55 centre			2
' we have had a few puffins but most of the birds have been guillemots and a few razorbills			2
' about 300 of them have been found on @entity62			2
@entity63 sticks out in the @entity20 like a giant hand which grabs anything blown from the south west			0
' we are putting the deaths down to sheer exhaustion brought about by the adverse weather conditions			0
' these birds were exhausted , under weight and suffering from malnutrition as they have n't been able to feed or hunt			1
' about 20 per cent of them have had a dark oiling on them but it is impossible to say of this was before or after death			0
' it is a similar substance that was around six weeks ago which turned out to be a non-toxic waxy substance that was n't palm oil			0
' in @entity34 and the @entity85 there have been over 11,000 puffins that have washed up dead and none of them were covered in any oil			1
' exhaustion : the majority of the dead birds have washed up at sheltered @entity42 in @entity15 , having being swept across @entity43 by south westerly winds			1
( @entity94 image ) mr @entity50 said the birds could have died at any time in the last two weeks and were now being washed ashore			2
lumps of a waxy , white substance have also been discovered along the beaches			0
conservationist @entity99 is attempting to get the mystery pollution analysed to find out what it is and where it came from			0
he said : ' there are hundreds of large lumps of what i believe may be palm or vegetable oil all over the beach			0
' it is rancid , very smelly and without doubt a risk to humans , pets and any wildlife that may encounter it			0
' warning signs should have been put up alerting people to this pollution			0

storms over the past month have made it hard for birds to hunt and feed
majority of dead birds were washed up at @entity42 in @entity15
but numbers pale in *comparison* to 15,000 puffins found dead in @entity34
