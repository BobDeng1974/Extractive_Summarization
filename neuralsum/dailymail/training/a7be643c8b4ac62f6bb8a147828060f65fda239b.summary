by @entity0 @entity1 was given a 95 per cent chance of survival when he was taken to hospital , suffering vomiting and diarrhoea a four - year - old boy who was given a 95 per cent chance of survival when he arrived at hospital , died after an @entity11 trust made 28 mistakes in his care			1
@entity1 was taken to @entity14 , @entity15 , suffering vomiting and diarrhoea			2
medics misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis - a stomach virus which can not be treated with antibiotics - and as a result was not given the medication that would have saved him			1
but @entity1 actually had an invasive form of sore throat bacteria @entity26 which should have been picked up by a blood test			1
the young boy soon became dehydrated as he was denied vital fluids			1
he turned grey as the septic shock took hold of his body and he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest hours after his arrival			1
his grieving mother @entity36 said she was initially ' denied information ' but later discovered her son actually been given a 95 per cent chance of survival , had medics acted sooner			2
@entity42 , which was put in special measures in 2013 , has now apologised to the family and are set to agree five - figure compensation			2
ms @entity46 said : ' i feel that it ’s every parent ’s right to know that the main hospital in their area has had major failings in care for a child who , if treated correctly , had a 95 per cent chance of survival from the infection			0
' even when i questioned the care at the time i was told that it was just a tummy bug and that it would be fine			0
' even at the end when @entity61 was losing his battle with life after being so let down earlier in the day by the staff at @entity14 , i saw the most unprofessional handling of the situation			0
' it was a shambles , it was out of control			0
if you think one doctor is wrong you go to someone else , but if every member of staff is saying the same thing you do n’t question it			0
' the mother - who has two other young sons - added : ' @entity1 was so special , and really kind and gentle , he was just lovely			1
' at the time he had an 18 month - old brother , @entity77 , who was just at that stage where he really liked his older brother ; it was really , really hard			0
' ms @entity46 took her son to @entity14 ’s @entity83 department in october 2011 and was initially told to go back home to @entity85 , @entity86 , and give him fluids			0
@entity1 ( pictured right with mother @entity36 and little brother @entity77 ) actually had an invasive form of sore throat bacteria @entity26 which should have been picked up by a blood test			1
the young boy soon became dehydrated as he was denied vital fluids she insisted his condition was more serious and that he remained at the hospital			1
despite blood tests revealing he was severely dehydrated and was heading for septic shock , doctors continued to refuse him antibiotics or give him fluids			1
throughout the evening , the nurses and doctors failed to notice @entity1 ’s fast heart rate and rapid breathing - a sign of septic shock - and between 8pm and 1am failed to monitor him at all			1
despite nurses noticing his grey colour and dilated pupils doctors arrived too late and he died following a cardiac arrest			2
he was eventually given antibiotics too late - just half an hour before he died			0
even after his death nurses still told his distressed mother he had a stomach bug and not streptococcal			0
the family ’s solicitor @entity117 , of @entity119 , said : ' it ’s another sad example of the @entity11 only admitting to mistakes after legal action is taken , putting the family through additional stress at what is already such a traumatic time			0
' he died at the @entity14 aged just four , due to 28 admitted counts of negligence by hospital staff in treating @entity1 for a stomach bug despite blood tests revealing he was severely dehydrated and was heading for septic shock , doctors continued to refuse him antibiotics or give him fluids			1
throughout the evening , the nurses and doctors failed to notice @entity1 's fast heart rate and rapid breathing - a sign of septic shock - and between 8pm and 1am failed to monitor him at all @entity142 , chief executive of @entity42 , said : ' i sincerely and without reservation apologise to ms @entity46 for the actions of the trust which led to the death of @entity1 in 2011			1
' we have thoroughly reviewed the circumstances around @entity1 ’s death , as well as policies , procedures and staff training , and we commissioned an independent expert review			2
' a number of other improvements have been made , which include strengthening our early warning process for recognising when a child ’s condition is getting worse , improving how we care and treat patients with gastroenteritis , in particular the use and types of fluid given and additional advanced life support training			0
' we recognise and regret that nothing will ever change this terrible situation for the @entity168 but we have learned the lessons and hope these changes will ensure that as far as possible no other family will suffer in the same way			0
' @entity1 leaves behind a four year - old brother @entity77 and @entity175 , who is now eight months old .			2
