@entity0 and @entity1 meet in the @entity2 for the first time on sunday since the 1973 final at @entity5			1
@entity6 @entity0 were the 1 - 0 victors over @entity8 ’s holders thanks to a first - half goal from @entity10			1
but the match is best remembered for goalkeeper @entity15 ’s remarkable double save from @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity0 keeper @entity15 makes his spectacular double save , this one from @entity14 on full - time , manager @entity17 ran on to the pitch in his red tracksuit , overcoat and trademark trilby and a statue now celebrates that moment outside of the @entity25			1
ahead of the third - round tie , @entity27 ’s @entity26 went to meet @entity15 , defender @entity29 – who scrambled the ball clear after the save – and midfielder @entity32 , who at 20 years old was the youngest player on the pitch			1
we listened in to their memories of that famous day			2
@entity0 boss @entity17 hugs his jubilant goalkeeper @entity15 ( left ) after winning the 1973 @entity2 @entity26 : it ’s saturday , may 5 , 1973 , take it away … @entity29 : well , i never slept			1
@entity32 : he was out on the town man ! @entity29 : well , i did n't like to say that … but no , if i slept an hour i 'd done well			1
i was just so pumped for the game that the match day started for me the night before			0
@entity32 : i do n't think any of us slept because we were so excited			1
the night before there was a preview show on the television with @entity49 and @entity50 on a panel			0
they were talking about how @entity53 were going to pummel us and give us a good hiding			1
that geed us all up			0
we did n't need a team talk after that			0
i roomed with @entity59 , who was just one of the young lads			0
we ate bags of sweets all night and watched the television			0
the next morning we had breakfast with all the television cameras and we all went down in our scruffs , while @entity53 in the other hotel were there in their suits and ties			1
@entity27 's @entity26 ( far left ) talks with @entity32 , @entity29 and @entity15 @entity17 holds aloft the @entity2 after second division @entity0 beat the holders @entity1 @entity15 : i think the biggest thing for me on cup final day was that we 'd already beaten the other two top quality sides with @entity76 in the semi-final and @entity78 in an earlier round , so there was no reason why we could n't beat @entity82			1
i was n't having to deal with @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 though ! @entity32 : in those days you faced each other during the @entity88 , so i stared at @entity89 for some reason , because he was the top @entity91 player			1
that was the only time i was a little bit nervous			2
@entity29 : to be honest , i do n't think we ever thought we 'd get beat			1
we did n’t go into any game thinking that			0
@entity26 : @entity10 put you ahead and then the moment we all remember , the save … @entity15 : i 've spoken to @entity14 many times since and he says he hit it as sweet as he could			1
he always says he 'd do the same again			0
well , i 'd do the same again too ! @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity102 ( right ) remember they could n't sleep a wink night before the final @entity106 ( left ) , @entity15 ( centre ) and @entity29 reminisce as they look at a picture from cup final day @entity32 : @entity110 made great saves all the time			1
you did n't realise it			0
@entity15 : i think it was just the occasion			1
i probably did a better one against @entity116 two weeks before that , but there were only two men and a dog there			0
it 's when the cameras are there and it 's the occasion			0
if we 'd lost the cup , no - one would talk about it			2
@entity29 : you should have held the first shot though ! @entity15 : well if i had we would n't still be sat here talking about it would we ? ! @entity26 : then it ’s full - time and @entity17 is running across the pitch … @entity15 : for whatever reason , @entity17 chose to do that			1
that was @entity17 's way of releasing all his adrenaline			0
that was the way he was			0
i was looking around at all the supporters and waving , and then suddenly @entity17 appears			0
@entity32 ( left ) , @entity15 ( centre ) and @entity29 pose in front of the statue of former manager @entity17 @entity146 and @entity15 hold the @entity2 as they parade the trophy in front of the @entity0 fans @entity26 : what was that walk up to the @entity153 like ? @entity29 : well , when @entity17 ran onto the pitch and wrapped his arms around me , he stuck his thumb in my eye ! so i could n't see very well going up or going down the steps			1
@entity32 : when i was a kid , all i wanted to do was go up those steps , get my medal and turn around at the crowd			1
i remember afterwards in the dressing - room , @entity162 came to me and said “ do you fancy going back out on the pitch ? ”			2
so we went out with one of those red - and - white striped plastic bowler hats on and a bottle of champagne			0
there was n't a person in the stadium , so we walked to the six - yard box and did n't say a word			0
we just took in this weird atmosphere , and thought back to the game			0
@entity26 : there must have been some party ? @entity15 : it was at the @entity182			1
all the press expected @entity53 to win , so all the cameras were at their hotel , but then they had to rush across to ours			1
@entity102 ( left ) , @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity188 pictured with the @entity2 trophy at the @entity25 @entity32 : we 'd been partying for hours , but we suddenly got hungry			1
someone said do you fancy going for something to eat ? we were on the end of @entity195 and we went to a burger place on @entity197			0
there we were , @entity2 winners in a burger place with a load of our fans at two o’clock in the morning			2
it was packed ! @entity15 : the biggest disappointment for me was that we had a game at @entity206 on the monday night			2
so on the sunday morning , the wives had the cup on the bus and were driving home			0
they had people passing them on the motorway , hooting at them with the cup			0
but we had to go to @entity215 so we had a night out afterwards - we were a bit green going back ! @entity32 : we had to stop at @entity217 to get tidied up for the reception			1
@entity26 : that must have been an incredible homecoming ? @entity17 holds aloft his hat as he leaves the field after his side 's victory against @entity82 in 1973 @entity29 : there was just red and white supporters everywhere hanging off the tops of buildings as we drove through town			1
@entity15 : they pushed the beds out of the hospitals as we went past just so they could see it			2
@entity32 : when we got to the stadium , they had a coffin with @entity82 on in the centre - circle			1
@entity26 : you must have felt like superstars ? @entity29 : not at all			2
at the time , @entity32 was on £ 25 a week and £ 25 appearance money			1
@entity15 : i was on a lot more than that ! @entity29 : i was on about £ 100 quid , so was @entity15			1
it was decent money but we were n’t that much better off than the man on the street , we mixed with them			0
i mean , my car failed its @entity253 three times ! it was a sportsback @entity256 type , nothing flash			0
the @entity0 players take a lap of honour around the pitch after winning the @entity2 @entity29 ( left ) recalls driving through @entity0 on the homecoming to see red and white fans everywhere @entity32 : i had an old @entity264			1
@entity15 : i had a white @entity265			2
then when we won the cup i must admit i got a flashy sporty one … @entity32 : but we were just ordinary blokes really			2
i was living in @entity269 in a little council house with my mam and dad			0
when we won the cup i signed a form to take it home for a day			0
i took it to the village in the boot of my car			0
i put it in my lounge and everyone from the council estate came and lined up for their photo taken – they had their babies in the top and all sorts			0
@entity29 : i ’m actually still living in the same house just outside of town			2
@entity15 : i was living up the street from @entity29 and our favourite pub , @entity294 , was just down the road			1
we ’d meet there for a couple of pints at half five then go and pick up our wives or girlfriends – some would pick both up ! then we went to see some fantastic turns in town , the likes of @entity305 and @entity306 , brilliant times			0
@entity308 caried by teammates @entity146 and @entity102 after the @entity311 victory @entity26 : that one game has defined your lives really ? @entity15 : when i 'm walking around the town now , they all know what we 've done			2
but what i like is when they say they watched it at their aunty 's because it was their first colour television			0
when they were getting their first colour tvs it shows you how long ago it was ! @entity32 : what amazes me is that people who were born 20 years after that all know us			2
their parents have drilled it into them , so we 're still household names with people who were born in the 80s or 90s			0
maybe if we 'd won a cup or two since then , we might not be as well known in the town			0
@entity29 : it 's a bit embarrassing still talking about it 42 years on though … listening to their tales , you get the impression they are far from embarrassed … and who can blame them ?			2
