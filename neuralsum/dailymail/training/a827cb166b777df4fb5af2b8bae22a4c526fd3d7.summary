by @entity0 @entity1 admits that he has felt ‘ ashamed ’ over @entity3 ’s slump at times this season but believes his team are still capable of producing another big performance to topple @entity8 champions @entity7			1
@entity3 were paired with the @entity10 giants in the draw for the @entity13 quarter - finals yesterday after wiping out a two - goal deficit to beat @entity15 at @entity16 in midweek			1
it was one of the few highlights of @entity1 ’s troubled reign and the @entity3 boss confessed that , after suffering six home defeats this season , it was a relief to be able to look supporters in the eye as he made the walk from his dug - out to the tunnel			1
joy of victory : @entity3 boss @entity1 celebrates his side 's 3 - 0 win over @entity15 with the @entity16 fans red alert : @entity3 celebrate one of @entity37 's three goals against @entity15 which sent them through to the @entity13 quarter - finals despair : @entity1 , left , looks on as his team toil against @entity40 during @entity3 's 3 - 0 home defeat ‘ i thought it was great that i could applaud the supporters on wednesday night , ’ he said			1
‘ in some of the other games i ’ve felt ashamed because the team have n’t played well enough			1
‘ the big thing was that i could look the supporters in the face after the game because i thought that we had given them something to shout about and had nothing to be ashamed of in our performance			0
’ @entity7 have knocked @entity3 out of @entity8 twice since sir @entity54 ’s side famously beat them with two late goals to win the @entity13 in 1999 , and will be firm favourites when they meet again next month			1
@entity1 , an avid observer of @entity10 football who was linked with the managerial posts at @entity61 and @entity62 during his time at @entity64 , is well aware of what his opponents can do			2
his scouting missions to @entity68 to watch potential transfer targets @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 have given the @entity3 boss a valuable insight into @entity76 ’s side , and he believes there are some weaknesses that can be exploited			2
famous night : @entity3 beat @entity7 2 - 1 to win the 1999 @entity13 final past meeting : @entity7 knocked @entity3 out of the 2001 @entity13 at the quarter - final stage @entity83 class : @entity7 winger @entity85 's goal in the second leg of the 2010 @entity13 quarter - final saw @entity3 exit the competition on away goals ' i ’ve got a few things that i ’ve seen that i would try to work on and capitalise on , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ they are the holders but i do n’t think the holders have ever won the @entity13 so hopefully we can try and do something about that			0
‘ when we were 2 - 0 down to @entity15 i do n’t think there were too many people putting us through so in a lot of ways it did n’t matter who i drew but i ’ve probably got the favourites			2
ones to beat : @entity104 are the current holders of the @entity13 ‘ they proved that they ’re the best team in the world by winning the @entity109 but i ’m actually looking forward to it			0
‘ there have been some epic games between the two clubs over the years and if i can get another epic game then that will mean we have come close			0
that has to be the idea			0
’ it was perhaps typical of @entity1 ’s time at @entity16 that no sooner had he spoken about his excitement at facing @entity7 than @entity37 — whose hat - trick against @entity15 made it all possible — was effectively ruled out of both legs with a knee injury			1
blow : @entity3 will have to do without the services of @entity127 for the @entity104 clash as the @entity83 striker has been ruled out for six weeks with a leg injury @entity3 are already without @entity131 for the first game through suspension , meaning that @entity1 may have to rely on @entity134 at left back , and he could offer no assurances that injured central defenders @entity137 and @entity138 will be fit in time			1
at least the embattled @entity3 boss could enjoy a little respite on friday			2
while victory over the @entity143 lifted some of the pressure building around him , the quarter - final draw completely overshadowed saturday ’s difficult trip to @entity147			1
the challenge , he acknowledges , is to produce performances like wednesday night on a consistent basis			0
change in fortunes ? @entity1 has called on his @entity3 side to reproduce the performance against @entity15 for the remainder of the season ‘ i came to the club to have those nights , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i joined @entity3 because i knew they would happen more often than not			2
' we ’ve had some big highs , mainly in the @entity13 , but some big lows in the @entity162 and that is the bit we will look to improve on			0
‘ it has been a difficult initiation period but i still believe that my time here will have more good times than bad times			0
we will not always be right at the top but we have to be closer than where we are now			0
’ @entity3 wins : @entity171 wins : @entity172 : 4 september @entity173 : @entity174 : 2 the first of three clashes in the 1998 - 99 @entity13 came in the group stage , with @entity178 and @entity179 both scoring			0
may @entity180 : @entity181 : 2 @entity3 ’s finest hour			0
after @entity7 took an early lead , @entity3 hung on but last - minute goals from @entity184 and @entity185 , below , won @entity3 the treble			1
april @entity187 : @entity174 : 1 @entity7 won the quarter - final , first leg 1 - 0 at @entity16 and went 2 - 0 up on the night			0
@entity190 scored but it was too little too late			0
@entity192 : @entity174 : 1 in the quarter - final , first leg , @entity194 , below , scored after two minutes , but two late @entity7 goals pegged @entity3 back			1
@entity197 : 2 after losing in @entity68 , @entity3 went 3 - 0 up before @entity7 scored			2
@entity198 was sent off before @entity85 ’s volley secured an away - goals win .			0
