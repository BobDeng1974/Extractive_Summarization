an invasion of privacy ? a new @entity2 button that lets you ask friends if they 're single or taken has been branded ' invasive ' and ' naggy ' over-sharing : the ' ask ' button appears on the profiles of users who have left their relationship status blank , and includes a note section to explain why you 're inquiring about their status once you send your ' ask ' request , the friend receives a notification that says : ' hello ! i am wondering about your relationship ! ' they can either ignore it or respond with an answer , with the option of sending it back to you directly or sharing it with the general public			1
while the social media site has had an option to ' ask ' for a friend 's phone number , address and e-mail for some months now , the relationship status ' ask ' button is a new development - and not everyone is happy about it			0
one person wrote on @entity53 : ' if @entity2 was n't already the biggest invasion of privacy , you can now " ask " people about their relationship status			1
' others called it ' naggy ' and questioned its necessity , with one person writing : ' how awkward is that @entity2 devoted a single button to ask your friends why they 're single ? ' even more people have asserted that the button is just another move @entity2 has taken to exploit users ' private information			1
' how awkward is that @entity2 devoted a single button to ask your friends why they 're single ? ' @entity2 ceo @entity73 explained this company ethos in an 2010 interview			1
' people have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people , ' he said			0
' we view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are			0
' but despite the negative reactions , some users have taken the view that the button provides an easy way for singletons to express their interest in one another			2
indeed , one man tweeted : ' hitting the " ask " button next to " relationship status " on @entity2 is the ultimate gentlemanly move			2
' and a @entity101 writer asked readers : ' is this a game changer for spitting @entity2 game , @entity105 ? '			0

response to the addition has been mostly negative , with some @entity2 users calling it ' invasive ' and ' naggy '
