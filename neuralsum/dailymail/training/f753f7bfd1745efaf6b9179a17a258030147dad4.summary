by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:31 pm on 16th july 2011 students who attend former polytechnics are more likely to be unemployed or in low - skilled jobs at the end of their degree compared to those who go to more traditional universities			1
new figures revealed that graduates from universities such as @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are twice as likely to end up unemployed at the end of their degree compared to those from ' red brick ' institutions such as @entity17 and @entity18			1
however the figures revealed that @entity20 - one of the most respected education establishments in the world - was falling behind @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity26 universities in employment rates			1
former poly : graduates from polytechnics such as @entity31 are more likely to end up unemployed compared to those from more traditional institutions @entity34 , the @entity35 - speaking to the @entity36 - said the figures showed that some universities would have to ' raise their game '			1
the figures revealed that one in five graduates from some of the country 's newer universities failed to find a job within six months last year - compared with one in ten elsewhere			2
universities minister @entity34 said some institutions needed to ' raise their game ' they also highlighted the devastating effect the recession has had on jobs opportunities for graduates with almost 20,000 former students still out of work six months after finishing their courses			1
this is a 50 per cent increase since before the recession			0
and instead of being in high - flying professional jobs - as they may have expected before starting university - thousands of graduates have been forced to take low - skilled work as shelf - stackers , bar staff and cleaners			2
the figures - released by the @entity67 - showed that 94 per cent of new graduates who attended the universities of @entity18 and @entity17 had found a job or begun postgraduate study within six months			0
a similar success rate was seen at @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity78 universities			0
however just 78 per cent of those who graduated from the @entity80 were in work or further study within six months			0
the picture was similar at many other former polytechnics			0
a total of 90.2 per cent of @entity20 graduates were either working or doing further study within six months of completing their degree last year			2
this is down from its own figure of 92.6 per cent from the previous year and below the national average of 90.4 per cent			0
a spokesman for @entity20 told the @entity36 that the rise in unemployed @entity20 students was down to a drop in the numbers choosing to go into postgraduate study , possibly as a result of the financial climate .			1
