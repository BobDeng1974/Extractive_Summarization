new figures from the @entity1 show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from rickets the number of children suffering from rickets – once associated with @entity9 poverty – is on the rise , with a fourfold increase in sufferers in the last ten years			1
new figures from the @entity1 show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition which is caused by a lack of @entity18 in the financial year 2012 - 13			1
ten years earlier the figure was just 190			1
some experts fear that parents obsessing about protecting their children from sunlight , which boosts the body ’s level of the key vitamin , has led to the rise			1
it is also thought that children spending more time indoors on computer games , more parents driving their kids to school and fewer children taking cod liver oil capsules have all contributed to the rise			1
the disease , which causes brittle bones and deformities , was common in 19th century @entity39 but was all but wiped out by improvements in nutrition			1
now it is thought that a fear of contracting skin cancer could be making parents too cautious and be partly responsible for the upsurge in @entity47			2
the body produces vitamin d when it is exposed to the sun and it can also be obtained by eating foods such as oily fish , eggs and liver			2
@entity55 , director of 121 @entity56 , and a spokesperson for the @entity58 , said : ‘ there are several factors involved in the rise in rickets			2
‘ it was a problem disease in the 19th century but a number of things including diet with more dairy and protein , better health and the introduction of cod liver oil by the government in @entity73 , helped reduce it to very small numbers			1
‘ now it is on the rise again partly because of a change in the quality of our diet and partly because of our aversion to sunlight , which has been caused by our justifiable concerns about skin cancer			2
the body produces vitamin d when it is exposed to the sun and it can also be obtained by eating foods such as oily fish , eggs and liver ‘ people now are eating much less oily fish , fewer dairy products and not supplementing			0
kids are also eating more processed and junk food , while people whose bodies are obese find it much more difficult to access their vitamin @entity18 ‘ in addition the skin cancer message has got home and people are aware of the dangers of burning			0
but perhaps things have gone too far as exposure to sunlight is the best way to absorb vitamin d and as little as 20 minutes per day of sun on your face and arms can be more than enough			0
’ she added that the babies of mothers already low in vitamin d were the children most as risk as they would have no way of boosting their levels			0
‘ there are now campaigns to get mothers to boost their vitamin d levels so that they can pass it on to their babies in their breast milk , ’ she said			0
people with darker skin have more difficulty getting vitamin d from sunlight and so it is these people , often ethnic minorities , and their children who are more at risk of rickets			0
professor @entity135 , said : ‘ the data confirms our suspicions in relation to the epidemiology of vitamin d deficiency , particularly in our own paediatric orthopaedic clinic			0
‘ there is no doubt that it is multifactorial both in terms of reduced exposure to sunshine , but also the tension between the dermatological advice in respect of sun screen and adequate sun exposure			0
‘ however , it should be remembered that vitamin d deficiency is utterly preventable and easily treated by minor supplements			0
‘ it is also important to note that the chief medical officer has now advised that all children from the age of 6 months to 5 years should take vitamin d supplements in order to prevent deficiency and its effect on later health issues			1
