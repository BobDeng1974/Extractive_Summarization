last updated at 3:50 pm on 2nd december 2011 given the current economic climate , these should probably be handed out to everyone in @entity3 - a wallet that ' tightens up ' when you run short of cash			2
the wallets - working prototypes created by @entity10 - also ' swell ' when you 're rich , and shrink when you 're low on funds , a feature that the researchers promise could ' help attract potential mates '			2
' the wallet protects the money within it when you need to be thrifty with a hinge that resists opening - it can be mapped to a monthly budget goal			1
' the wallet ' protects ' your money with a hinge that resists opening when you do n't have much money left - you can map it to a monthly budget goal , and the wallet communicates with a phone via @entity26 to stay up to date with your balance the prototypes are connected to your phone by @entity26 - and communicate via a tiny component in the wallet , which ' controls ' a hinge			1
' our platform consists of fingers , microprocessors embedded in personal objects , and hand routing software running on a cell phone , ' say the researchers			0
' the wallet buzzes through a vibrating motor whenever your bank processes a transaction			0
' ' this encourages a conscious connection between handing over your credit card and your hard - earned money being harvested from the bank , and alerts you to fraud when you get a buzz without making a purchase			0
' the @entity53 are working prototypes , tough enough to sit on			0
they communicate with a phone through @entity26 , using its data connection to get financial information from the user 's bank accounts the prototypes , known as @entity53 , are working prototypes - and actually do buzz and ' clamp shut ' when money runs short			1
' the @entity53 are working prototypes , tough enough to sit on , ' says the @entity10 lab. ' they communicate with a cellphone through @entity26 , using its data connection to get financial information from the user 's bank accounts			1
' the big question is , of course , how much would a @entity26 - equipped , motorised , computer - controlled wallet set you back - and would you save anything at all in the long run ?			0

@entity10 prototype 's ' hinge ' tightens when funds run low
connects to phone via @entity26 to *monitor* finances
wallet ' swells ' when user 's accounts are full
hinge can be mapped to a monthly budget
