normally all eyes on are on the politician 's wives and their outfits during party conference season			1
but @entity6 leader @entity5 was in the spotlight today after bizarrely wearing not one , but four different outfits in a single day			2
as he battled against claims the @entity6 are indecisive and struggle commit to a course of action , he wore a suit for tv interviews , a smart casual outfit for a school visit and a black shirt and chinos for a q&a session which looked more suited to the garden centre than the conference hall			1
he then switched back to his blue suit before the day was out			2
embarking on a media blitz this morning , @entity5 ( left ) wore a dark blue suit , blue shirt and pink tie for his interviews on @entity28			1
then on a visit to @entity30 in @entity31 , mr @entity5 wore jeans and a pale blue shirt ( centre ) , but by this afternoon he was in grey chinos and a black shirt ( right ) mr @entity5 began the day with a media blitz of tv and radio interviews , appearing on @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity44 's today programme , @entity28 , @entity45 and @entity47 's @entity46			1
in all of the interviews he wore a dark blue suit , light blue shirt and a pink tie , despite listeners to radio shows being unable to see him			1
barely an hour later he visited @entity30 in @entity54 , @entity55 , with his wife @entity56			2
to speak to the schoolchildren , mr @entity5 wore dark jeans , a light blue shirt and brown suede shoes			1
aimed at promoting @entity6 policies on childcare and school dinners , the couple tried their hand at making scones			0
returning to the @entity69 conference centre on the @entity70 , mr @entity5 took questions from @entity6 activists in the main hall			2
but not before dipping into his wardrobe again , and pulling on a black shirt over a pair of light blue chinos			1
mr @entity5 had his suit on for appearances on @entity47 's @entity46 ( left ) and even a radio interview on @entity81 ( right )			1
he was later spotted back in his suit at the end of the day @entity6 leader @entity5 today looked to wife @entity56 for support as he warned his party has the ' fight of our lives ' to survive at the next election mr @entity5 and his wife @entity56 visited @entity90 in @entity31 to try their hand at making scones the couple were all smiles as they chatted to pupils and were presented with a posie of @entity98 thistles there was much speculation that the deputy prime minister was wearing jeans to address the party faithful , on what is a working day			1
but aides were quick to stress : ' they are chinos not jeans			2
' he was later spotted back in his suit at the end of the day earlier he teamed the ensemble with a brown sweater and bookish glasses while he waited for @entity117 's keynote speech			2
the bizarre decision to dress down on a work day came as mr @entity5 warned his party they face the ' fight of our lives ' to stay in power			1

asked if he would rather get into bed with @entity134 or @entity135 in a new power - sharing deal , mr @entity5 joked ' it 's @entity56 every single time '			1
mid-afternoon mr @entity5 added a brown sweater to his ensemble as he waited for @entity117 's keynote speech no - one could quite understand why mr @entity5 chose to address delegates wearing a black shirt during a q&a during the q&a session in the main hall of the @entity69 , mr @entity5 was asked about drugs , devolution , press regulation and arms sales according to a poll published tonight , most voters , 56 per cent , believe the @entity6 have become irrelevant			1
the @entity153 survey for @entity154 found just 26 per cent disagree			0
just 14 per cent trust mr @entity5 to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the @entity6 leader will break his pledges			2
some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into @entity161 with the conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by @entity5			2
but ousting the deputy prime minister and replacing him with a new leader would mean just 18 per cent are more likely to vote for the @entity6			1
mr @entity5 has come under pressure to spell out what his key demands would be before entering into a coalition with @entity132 or the @entity131			0
but in keeping with the @entity6 reputation for indecision , he insisted he would decide - but not yet			0

' mr @entity5 struck a casual pose on the main stage , in contrast to @entity134 and @entity135 's more formal looks at their party gatherings the @entity6 leader added : ' i really do think that if either @entity132 or the @entity162 were to run this country on their own again , the country would go backwards			1
it would go backwards economically under @entity132 , it would go backwards socially under conservatives			0
' i 'm really pleased that we are the party saying that there 's a more hopeful , positive vision of the future built around a simple old - fashioned liberal concept , which is opportunity for everybody			0
' a major split has opened up between the @entity131 and @entity6 over how £ 25billion can be raised to eradicate the deficit after the election			0
last week @entity131 chancellor @entity202 made clear it should come entirely from spending cuts , including £ 3billion from freezing benefits			0
but mr @entity5 has insisted some of the money should come from tax rises			0
he told @entity44 's today programme : ' our overall approach is that we want to maintain roughly what we have done in this government , which is that the bulk of the savings come from spending reductions , about 80 per cent but about 20 per cent come from tax increases			0
' on @entity41 , mr @entity5 hinted that he would allow an in - out referendum on @entity175 's membership of the @entity220 if he entered a new coalition with the @entity131			2
' we have said in law for the first time ever , if there is a change in the rules of the @entity220 , the so called treaties , powers are moved from @entity231 and @entity232 to @entity233 , there will be a referendum			0
' i have gone even further than that , i have been saying for as long as i have been leader of this party , when that referendum takes place , the decision should be in or out			0
' our position is clear , there will be a referendum , we have guaranteed it in law , when the rules of the game change in the @entity220 and new things are asked of the @entity175 and i believe that when that is held the question on the ballot paper should be in or out			0
' appearing on @entity45 / @entity251 , mr @entity5 admitted to mistakes in the early days of the coalition , saying he disappeared into the ' boiler room ' of government to make ' gory decisions ' but failed to speak to the public about what he was doing			0
on the school visit this morning @entity5 's wife @entity56 wore black trousers and a red print top , but for her husband 's q&a she wore a beige dress and bright orange shoes in an apparent show of solidarity , mrs @entity268 's striking footwear matched the @entity6 ' official colours @entity5 's wife @entity56 sported two looks today , wearing black trousers and a red print top to @entity90 in @entity31 this morning , before changing for her husband 's q&a into a beige dress and bright orange shoes			1
