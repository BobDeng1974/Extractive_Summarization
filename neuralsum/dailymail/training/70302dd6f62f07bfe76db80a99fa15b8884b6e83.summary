by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 18:58 est , 23 august 2013 for cycling enthusiast @entity2 , there has only ever been one mission			1
to ride as fast as he possibly can on two wheels			0
as a child he was inspired watching and reading about the land speed world record attempts of the 1960s			2
and now , in a bid to prove what can be achieved through backyard engineering , he has custom - built a bike which reached speeds of up to 80mph			1
but to hit such dizzying heights , a departure from the norm was necessary			0
that came in the form of a 104 - tooth chainring which was purposely built for the bike			1
and in another tribute to @entity39 engineering , he wanted to use his old @entity41 car to block the wind			1
with the help of a friend , he built a frame onto the back of the classic car to act as a wind tunnel			1
' the idea had been in my head for a while , ' said @entity2 , in a documentary made by @entity54 about the attempt			1
' it just needed a tipping point			0
' innovation : @entity2 used his skills as a frame builder to come up with a design which could hit 80mph determined : amateur cyclist @entity2 said he wanted to see what was possible through ' backyard engineering ' the current land speed record for a bike is 167mph which was set by @entity67 using a dragster in the @entity69			1
' we didnt have a dragster or the @entity69 , ' said @entity2			1
' but this is n't about setting records			0
this was about using our imagination and being resourceful			0
we used my old car and a bike i built to see how fast we could go			1
' during a first run out on the roads , @entity2 achieved 60mph			1
but he felt the bike could definitely go further			2
cycling on a flat course , a reasonably fit amateur rider should be able to reach speeds of about 20mph on a normal bike			2
on a racing bike they might even reach 30mph			0
but thanks to a combination of climate control , specially - engineered bikes and thighs the size of most people 's waists , the likes of @entity96 reach almost 50mph			0
of course , with wind assistance and a steep decline , even amateur cyclists could expect to reach around 60mph			0
one of the major factors to be overcome is air drag			0
this is why @entity2 built a wooden fram over the back of his @entity41 so that he would face as little as possible			1
but over the years , cyclists have used all sorts of firepower to propel themselves to electrifying speeds			0
in may , a @entity110 cyclist broke the land speed record on a bicycle by attaching a hydrogen - peroxide rocket to the frame			2
@entity115 from @entity116 recorded a top speed of 163mph ( 263kph ) on his self - built vehicle on an old runway in @entity120 in @entity121			2
the 80mph top speed was set on an old @entity124 runway strip , one of the few places in the @entity126 with enough flat , straight track for @entity2 to attempt it			1
' it was potentially , fairly dangerous , ' said @entity2			2
' i was screaming go , go go			0
eventually i outran the car and ran out of road			0
' interested to see just how fast his bike is capable of going , @entity2 tested it out on rollers back in his workshop and reached 102mph			1
and that has given him determination to get back out on the road and go even faster			0
watch video of the @entity142 experiments in @entity144 from @entity145 on @entity146 .			0

bike frame builder @entity2 built high speed bike from *scratch*
used his old @entity41 with wooden frame attached as a wind tunnel
described the project as a tribute to ' backyard engineering '
