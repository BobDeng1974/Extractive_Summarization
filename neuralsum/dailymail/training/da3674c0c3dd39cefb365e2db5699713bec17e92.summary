by @entity0 @entity2 and @entity3 crews kept up their battle on monday to clear pathways for vessels hauling vital raw materials on the ice - clogged @entity8 , where a shipping logjam forced a weeklong shutdown of the nation 's largest steel factory			1
@entity14 remained largely at a crawl after a winter that produced some of the heaviest ice on record across the five inland seas , where more than half the surface area remained solid this week			0
icebreaking ships slogging across @entity23 were still encountering ice layers 2 feet to 3 feet thick			1
in some areas , wind and wave action created walls of ice up to 14 feet high			0
@entity38 said monday , april 7 , 2014 that its largest mill in @entity40 , @entity41 , is on limited production because of a lack of raw materials @entity38 's plant in @entity40 , @entity41 , had resumed limited operations after receiving a shipment over the weekend of iron ore from a company mill near @entity51 , which was sending one additional load , spokeswoman @entity45 said			1
two ships were scheduled to arrive tuesday with ore from mines in northern @entity56 following a two - week voyage across @entity23 , which ordinarily would take three days			1
other companies were hoping their supplies would be adequate to avoid significant disruptions			2
' nobody 's stockpile situation is very good , ' said @entity63 , a spokesman for the @entity64 , which represents companies that operate 57 @entity2 - flagged freighters on the @entity8			1

according to the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) @entity74 , about 94 % of @entity23 was covered with ice this winter only three ships were able to haul coal on the lakes in march , their cargos combining for 102,000 tons - down 70 percent from the same month in 2013 , he said			1
coal trade was 54 percent below the long - term first - quarter average			2
the @entity85 mill generates steel for industries such as construction and auto manufacturing			0
production resumed at one of the mill 's three furnaces after sunday 's shipment was received , @entity90 said			2
the @entity85 is capable of producing 7.5 million tons of steel per year			0
@entity38 was able to operate off stockpiles for some time before the ice began affecting production , @entity90 said			2
@entity99 , a steel industry analyst , said the company should have done better planning even though this winter was among the harshest in recent memory			0
@entity105 , a 140 - foot ice - breaking tug , sails through ice covered waters toward the shores off @entity41 as @entity38 said on monday , april 7 , 2014 that its largest mill in @entity40 had to halt production over the weekend production : @entity38 's sprawling @entity85 plant in @entity40 , @entity41 sits a short distance from @entity40 's @entity114 at one point , ice extended across 92 percent of the @entity8 , falling just short of the record set in 1979			1
' they know that every winter the @entity8 freeze over , ' @entity99 said			0
the shipping season officially began two weeks ago with the opening of navigational locks on the @entity35 connecting @entity122 and @entity37 , a bottleneck for vessels hauling iron ore and coal to manufacturers and electric power plants			1
but just one convoy of vessels - including two icebreakers and the two ships hauling iron ore - had traversed superior with loads of freight			1
two other coal haulers were docked in @entity23 , @entity72 , waiting to make deliveries to a power plant in @entity139 , @entity140 , said @entity141 , director of vessel traffic service for the @entity143 in @entity144			1
five empty vessels were expected to begin crossing @entity23 on tuesday to pick up iron ore			1
revelations : sightseers trek across a frozen expanse of @entity23 , the world 's largest freshwater lake , to the sea caves of the @entity151 near @entity152 , @entity72 on february 15 , 2014 the @entity155 power plant in @entity139 was operating just three of its five generating units to conserve coal until more arrives , spokesman @entity153 said			1
even so , there was n't enough demand to disrupt service , he said			0
the plant serves about 22,000 customers , mostly in @entity140 's @entity164			2
@entity166 , which operates five coal - fired plants in southeastern @entity140 , has dealt with dwindling stocks by taking some units out of production for maintenance ahead of schedule and making up for the loss by buying power from the grid , spokesman @entity165 said			2
' this will hold us over until we can rebuild our supplies , ' @entity165 said			0
@entity180 has not had any delays or material shortages because of @entity8 shipping problems , spokesman @entity179 said			0
nine @entity143 ships are capable of breaking ice but only one , the @entity188 , is equipped to deal with the thickest formations , @entity184 said			0
the @entity3 dispatched two heavy - duty vessels to assist			0
about three - quarters of @entity23 , the largest and deepest of the @entity8 , remained ice - covered			1
@entity184 estimated it would be about two weeks before the surface is clear enough for freighters to make the crossing without an icebreaker escort			0
even then , the icebreakers probably will be on duty well into may and possibly as late as @entity198			0
' we 'll be constantly on search - and - destroy missions , finding big pieces of ice and breaking them into smaller pieces , ' @entity184 said .			0

@entity38 's plant in @entity40 , @entity41 had to shut over the weekend after its iron ore supplies failed to arrive
two ships are scheduled to arrive on tuesday with ore from mines in northern @entity56
