however in passing sentence @entity36 told @entity9 and @entity21 : ' the trust that society places in their police officers is vitally important to everyone			1
' when that trust is broken by rogue officers as you became public confidence is eroded , it makes the job of honest officers far more difficult , and it seriously undermines society			0
' he said @entity55 footage , which had been shown to the jury , clearly showed the ' thoroughly unprofessional ' way the officers conducted themselves during the search			2
the judge added : ' why did you steal the money ? the answer , certainly in your case @entity9 , is simply greed , perhaps both greed and stupidity in your case @entity21			1
' he said the officers took the cash believing the suspect , whose home they thought they were searching , was an illegal immigrant who was unlikely to return to the flat or make a complaint			2
he added : ' the pair of you were or are bad apples who have tarnished the reputation of the @entity79 and the thousands of officers who do their job honestly on behalf of the public they serve , ' he said			2
