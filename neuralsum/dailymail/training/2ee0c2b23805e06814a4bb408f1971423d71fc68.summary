@entity0 is hoping for a chance to play himself into contention for a showdown with world champions @entity4 as he continues his comeback from an injury nightmare			1
the 26 - year - old made his first appearance for club or country in more than 10 months in @entity13 's 2 - 0 friendly victory over @entity14 last month following a gruelling fightback from a cruciate ligament problem			1
he played the full 90 minutes of club @entity18 's 1 - 1 @entity17 draw with @entity19 in @entity20 last thursday and with @entity21 missing from @entity23 's squad through injury , will hope to get the nod for saturday 's @entity27 qualifier against @entity28 in @entity29 and the intensely difficult trip to @entity4 which follows three days later			1
@entity0 hopes his injury nightmare is behind him as he pushes for a place in the @entity13 team for their @entity27 qualifiers with @entity28 and @entity4 over the coming days @entity0 suffered a cruciate ligament injury in @entity38 's @entity37 qualifier with @entity39 back in october 2013 and was on the sidelines for 10 months @entity0 said : ' i played in the @entity43 game during the week and i felt physically strong , so i think i am ready			1
hopefully i do get the chance and i do have an influence so i can play on tuesday			0
' i think any player enjoys playing in games like that			0
they are some of the best players in the world , so it 's good to see how you fare against them			2
' obviously , the first few games i played , it was just about getting minutes under my belt			2
but i think i am ready to play properly now , i think i am match - fit and ready to go			2
' it 's been all right			2
it 's been a bit frustrating not playing in the @entity61 , but i have got two games in in the last two and a half weeks , so i 'm happy enough coming into this week			2
' @entity13 will face @entity63 minnows @entity28 - who lost their opening game against @entity66 7 - 0 at home - at the @entity68 knowing goal difference could be important , but taking nothing for granted			1
@entity0 made his return for club @entity18 in their 1 - 1 draw with @entity19 in the @entity17 last week @entity23 will be hoping to gain at least four points from the weekend 's double - header @entity0 said : ' no football game is easy			1
obviously we will take the game seriously and hope to get the win			0
' i do n't think we will be going out there thinking , ' right , we are going to beat them five or six nil '			0
it 's not as easy as that			0
we will go out and try our best and hopefully , we get the win			0
' we are going into both games and treating them exactly the same			0
we will focus on saturday 's game first , hopefully get the result we need and then we will push on to @entity4 on tuesday			1
' @entity13 began their preparations in @entity89 on tuesday morning with much of the focus surrounding the camp on manager @entity23 's assistant @entity92 and his updated autobiography , @entity94 , although the older man was adamant it would not be allowed to prove a distraction			1
the build - up to the qualifiers have been dominated by the fall - out from assistant manager @entity92 's book @entity23 said : ' the most important issue here is our games , and saturday [ the match against @entity28 ] is really , really important			1
we have come off the back of a great win against @entity108 and it 's important to focus on that			0
' i genuinely do n't know what the headlines are in the book			0
it obviously was going to cause some sort of furore at some stage or another - the very fact he put his name to this book would suggest that it 's exactly what would happen			1
' it 's there and it does n't matter			0
the games are the most important things for us			0
