it is her only source of income but nobody has wanted to live there because it is a building site			0
the noise has also been unbearable			0
' ms @entity0 's company has been using pneumatic drills to dig out the basement and it left large cracks in the walls of the flats			1

i have tried over and over again to meet her but have been met with complete prevarication '			0

in 2012 she annoyed neighbours with noise from air conditioning units she fitted at her current £ 6million home in @entity159 without prior council approval			2
one critic said that their ' peace and quiet ' was at stake and eventually the dispute ended when ms @entity0 agreed to turn the units off if they got too noisy			1

' i have already compensated our neighbours with thousands of pounds			0
i understand that it is inconvenient for our neighbours to experience these works and have tried to be as neighbourly as possible			2
i did however ask if the builders were permitted access to a number of our neighbours balcony to stop a water leak coming into our property			0
sadly , one neighbour refused access asking for further compensation			2
close : @entity0 remains close to actress step - daughter @entity16 , who still calls her ' mum ' ' i really do sympathise with the neighbours as there are several other developments going on within this building , the large development behind my space is noisy to this date '			1
