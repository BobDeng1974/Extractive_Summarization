@entity0 have announced @entity1 is to leave his role as chief executive			1
the @entity4 , who joined the club in 2004 and worked as chief operating officer before succeeding @entity7 as chief exec in 2009 , departs on amicable terms to seek new opportunities			2
@entity11 , one of @entity14 's advisers , is set for a bigger role behind the scenes at @entity0			1
here , @entity17 tells you everything you need to know about the situation at @entity21			0
@entity22 with @entity23 in 2010 and the @entity25 trophy , @entity26 and @entity27 @entity28 ( left ) with @entity23 ( and his son @entity29 ) , @entity29 ( second right ) and @entity31 a smiling @entity11 , @entity14 's former @entity32 who is set to hold much more power at @entity0 @entity36 ’s gone , @entity37 ? ' @entity0 announces that @entity1 , after 10 successful years at the club including five as chief executive , is leaving @entity0 in order to pursue new business opportunities			1
' the club , and in particular the owner ( @entity14 ) and directors , wish to thank @entity1 for his many years of service to @entity0 and support his desire to seek new challenges			1
' @entity1 's efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world			1
' pending additional appointments , chairman @entity55 and director @entity56 will assume additional executive responsibilities			2
keep hold of her coat - tails , she is the next big thing at @entity0 and is clearly going places after the announcement that @entity1 is on his way out			1
@entity1 was responsible for the day - to - day running of the club from @entity21			2
he was initially commercial director at @entity0 and filled @entity7 's shoes in 2009			2
thankfully , we have never had to endure the type of press conference @entity7 squirmed through when @entity69 was appointed @entity71 ’s successor in september 2007			0
‘ he ’s the right man for the job , we are absolutely convinced			0
’ @entity1 - or ‘ @entity73 ’ as he was affectionately nicknamed by the media - negotiated @entity0 ’s massive kit deal with @entity76 , although as one industry insider said : ‘ they pay , we wear , not difficult ’			1
@entity1 was in the boardroom suite at @entity80 on saturday and there was no hint the chief executive was about to quit @entity0			1
director of football @entity31 was there , along with affable secretary @entity86 , chairman @entity55 and the up - and - coming figure of @entity11			0
she runs the show now			0
@entity1 has worked at @entity0 for 10 years , including five as chief executive how powerful is a @entity0 chief executive ? the most powerful man at @entity0 is @entity14 , period			1
beyond that @entity93 , chairman @entity55 and the highly - influential @entity28 jostle for position within @entity14 ’s inner circle			0
to be fair to @entity1 he has overseen a period when @entity0 have become an acceptable face in @entity99 football and they are now respected by some of the biggest clubs on the continent			1
he is a decent , all - round nice guy			0
@entity1 was famously at the club 's training ground on the day @entity105 set off a smoke bomb			1
public speaking was never his thing and he gave an awkward interview with @entity55 to @entity110 when @entity111 had been banned for insulting @entity112			0
@entity113 , pictured celebrating against @entity114 , wields the most power at @entity0 what does it mean for @entity0 in the @entity118 ? the accounts department at @entity0 might notice fewer receipts coming in from @entity121 on @entity122			2
it ’s a regular haunt for the power - brokers at @entity21 and takings wo n’t be down for long			0
beyond that , @entity71 will give a gushing tribute to @entity1 at his press conference on friday and his departure will be recorded in the matchday programme for the fixture with @entity132 at @entity21 on november 1			2
and further down the line ? the next chief executive will come under pressure to find a solution to @entity0 ’s long - running problem over a new stadium			1
rebuilding @entity21 appears to be impossible and they have lost out on the regeneration project of @entity142			0
@entity1 ( left ) pictured with @entity0 chairman @entity143 , who will assume additional responsibilities ' it has been a privilege to have played a role in the club 's considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years , but i feel the time is right to move on to other challenges			1
' i would like to thank mr @entity14 , the directors , the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club , and wish them much continued success in the future			2
' they floated the idea of ground - sharing with the @entity164 at @entity165 for a season while they remodelled @entity21 , but it was met with fierce opposition from local mp @entity169			0
finding somewhere in the borough to build a new super-stadium - to compete with the biggest clubs in @entity173 in terms of attendances and matchday revenue - will become more acute over the next few years			0
will this affect @entity71 ’s role ? @entity71 was used to being the main man in his first period in charge at @entity0 , but he accepted a different set of conditions and criteria when he returned to the club at the start of last season			1
he reports to the football club board now and they make the big decisions in terms of policy			0
@entity71 has his say , but his job is to coach the team and make transfer recommendations			0
the @entity0 chief executive pictured with former @entity197 manager @entity196 at @entity21 @entity199 ' additional executive responsibilities ' - who is she ? @entity14 ’s former @entity32			1
she has been close to a number of players in the past and has been on texting terms with them , which is not unusual for a modern - day executive			2
any word on a @entity210 ? @entity11			0
her time is now .			0

@entity1 has been chief executive at @entity0 for the past five years
@entity1 is leaving the club to ' pursue new business opportunities '
he said it has been a ' privilege ' to play a role in club 's achievements
club thank @entity1 for his many years of service and support his decision
