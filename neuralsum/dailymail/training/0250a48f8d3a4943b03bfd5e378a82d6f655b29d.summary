for almost a century , thousands gathered under the roof of this @entity3 pool to celebrate the golden age of public swimming			2
now plants , rust and decay adorn the walls of the @entity10 in @entity11 , which campaigners are fighting to save from destruction			1
these stunning images of the 1907 gala pool , which shut in 2003 amid spiralling repair bills , show the depth of heritage which could be lost from what is now one of @entity22 's oldest surviving facilities of its kind			1
he said : ' i wanted to get some images before it was too late ' magnificent : the pool opened in 1907 costing £ 33,000 and many of the original features remain , leading to safety fears as repair bills mount @entity40 : one small pool remains open but councillors have warned they can not afford the £ 24million to keep the building open - to the fury of campaigners			1
more than 100 gathered for an art project on the tiled floor last summer and another vowed to chain himself to the building photographer @entity30 , 27 , ventured past the @entity51 renaissance terracotta and red brick frontage to capture the haunting decay of one of the city 's most beloved buildings in a new light - using coloured torches to give it a haunting hue			2
the gala pool pictured closed in 2003 amid safety fears and was followed swiftly by @entity22 's only surviving set of pre-war private ' slipper baths ' - 46 of them - which shut in 2004			1
now the disused main pool cuts an eerie image			0
metal poles line the pool walls once brimming with water and the blue - and - white tiled arches no longer echo with the sound of pattering bare feet			2
one small pool remains open to the public , but that , too , faces closure within the next few years			1
opened on october 30 , 1907 , at a cost of £ 32,924 , the baths are now the oldest of only three @entity27 * - listed swimming pools still operating in @entity22			1
the other two are at the privately - owned @entity82 in @entity83 and @entity84 at @entity85 , also in @entity83			0
eerie : photographer mr @entity30 used coloured torches to produce an unusual effect , leaving silhouettes of ghostly figures under the arches disused : metal poles line the pool walls once brimming with water and the blue - and - white tiled arches no longer echo with the sound of pattering bare feet			0
the other two @entity27 * - listed baths to remain in any operation are both in @entity83 , at the @entity82 and @entity85 trick of the light : with the blue hue created by the photographer , the pool looks almost as though it could still be filled with water despite most of the building shutting more than a decade ago , its oak ticket office , spectator gallery , balconettes , steam - heated drying racks and 200,000 - litre cast iron cold water storage tank remain much as they were at the turn of the last century			1
now the ornate @entity3 building is at the centre of a fierce battle between history - lovers and @entity119 , and has been listed as one of the @entity122 's ten most endangered buildings in @entity22			2
in 2013 the @entity124 administration said it could not afford repairs to the building - which would cost £ 24million just to get into basic working order - and it would be cheaper to build and maintain new leisure centres than keep the crumbling small pool open for the sake of history			1
one @entity132 councillor , @entity132 , was so angry at the threat to the beloved baths that he vowed to chain himself to the building in protest			0
another protest last summer saw 110 swimmers pose as a living ' terracotta army ' on the pool 's tiled floor holding a banner which declared : ' we want to swim at @entity10 '			2
features : elsewhere in the pool building are a complete set of steam - heated drying racks , thought to be the best - preserved in @entity22 nook : corners of the pool building , which has a 100ft red brick and terracotta frontage , remain hidden under the equipment propping it up beauty : the ornate building is at the centre of a fierce heritage campaign and was listed as one of the ten most endangered buildings in @entity22 the photographer of seven years said : ' although it 's really only one big room , there are lots of interesting details to capture ' history : despite most of the building shutting more than a decade ago , its oak ticket office , spectator gallery and balconettes remain but campaigners say they are realistic - and would accept an option which makes use of the building 's beauty without actually re-filling it with water			1
mr @entity30 , a professional photographer for seven years , said : ' i know that the remaining pool is due to close in the next few years so i wanted to get some images before it was too late			0
' i wanted to get something different with my shots so i made a special point of going in the late afternoon when the light was a bit softer			0
' as it is winter i knew within an hour or so of me getting there it would be dark enough to use torches to really make the photos look good			0
' he added : ' i 've photographed quite a few abandoned and disused places over the past seven years , some buildings are really spectacular and this one is no exception			0
' i was in there about three hours as getting around in the dark , as well as trying to get each picture perfect , was quite time consuming			0
' although it 's really only one big room , there are lots of interesting details to capture and i think the pictures do the stunning architecture justice			0
' modernity : there are a few reminders that the pool was open to the public until 2003 - such as this @entity213 lap timer clock walkways : the grandoise paths to the spectator galleries have fallen silent , but in swimming 's golden age would have teemed with people shared story : dozens of pools have closed across @entity22 in the last few years since the decline of the age of baths and lidos uncertain : the future of the main room is yet to be mapped out , and its use could preserve the architecture without refilling the gala pool			1

campaigners fighting to save @entity11 's @entity27 * - listed @entity10 after gala pool shut in 2003
it has century - old tiling , oak ticket office , 200,000 - litre cast iron tank and complete set of pre-war private baths
small pool remains open , but council has warned the whole building faces closure amid £ 24million repair costs
