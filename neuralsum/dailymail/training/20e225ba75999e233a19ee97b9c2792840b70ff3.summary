by @entity0 shops are boarded up , the buildings look tatty and roads are littered with discarded mattresses , cupboards and wardrobes			0
welcome to the side of @entity8 , east @entity9 , that @entity12 organisers would rather you did n't see			1
@entity9 was awarded the @entity13 after the team behind the bid convinced officials that it would leave a lasting legacy for the regeneration of one of the capital 's poorest areas			1
but these grim pictures , taken only a stone 's throw from the @entity25 , reveal that more work is needed to turn around @entity8 's fortunes			0
discarded : mattresses and furniture line a pavement in @entity8 , where some residents are struggling to see how their area has benefited from the @entity12 @entity33 : a newsagent 's shop in @entity8 has its window boarded up damaging : this street has a view of the @entity39 , but a crashed car has been abandoned on the pavement almost £ 9.3billion has been spent on the @entity13 - with three - quarters of it earmarked for regeneration projects - but some residents say it is hard to see where the money has gone			1
the area has a new £ 1.45billion shopping mall , @entity49 , which has created 10,000 jobs and brought new waves of shoppers			1
the athletes ' village is believed to have cost about £ 1.1billion to build , although it was sold to @entity56 developers last year for only £ 557million			2
but critics fear other parts of @entity8 have been forgotten			1
@entity60 , of the @entity61 , a pressure group set up to hold @entity63 officials to account , said : ' you look at the old @entity65 and it is dwarfed by the new glistening @entity49			1
' @entity49 is a stark contrast to the town centre that 's for sure			1
they have placed some turquoise sculptures in @entity8 , but that 's about it			0
' the @entity12 ' @entity72 ' statue overlooks a building in need of refurbishment closed : a statue on the @entity25 stands behind businesses with their shutters down the dour exterior of the old shopping centre is a world away form the bright @entity49 complex			1
and the town 's high street is peppered with shut - down shops and closing down sales			0
mr @entity60 said : ' you could argue that there is no need to spruce it up because i doubt many visitors to the @entity12 will ever bother to venture outside the @entity25			0
' they will just get the tube or train straight to @entity8 and turn left into the @entity12 complex			0
a bed shop is closed with shutters drawn down in @entity8 town centre ' it 's questionable what tarting up the area would actually do for the fortunes of the businesses			2
they will just be inconvenienced by the games			0
' the @entity106 promise to use the @entity12 to inspire young people has come under attack after it emerged that just one in eight 16 - to - 24 year - olds have tickets for the @entity13			1
most people in that age group will not be attending any @entity12 events , the research found			0
figures show stark regional differences in the uptake of tickets , with only 3 per cent of youngsters from the north - east of @entity119 going to events			1
this compares with 21 per cent of young people from the @entity9 region , according to the study by specialist market research consultancy @entity125			1
@entity128 's managing director , @entity127 , said : ' if the @entity12 were intended to inspire young people , maybe there could have been a way to prioritise and perhaps discount their ticket applications			0
' ticket discounts only applied to those aged 16 and under			0
' shopkeeper @entity135 , who runs a newsagent business in the @entity65 opposite @entity49 , said : ' money needs to be invested in the @entity65 , not just the @entity25			1
' it does n't impact locals if not			2
how are we meant to compete ? ' the least the council could do is lower our rates so we can be more competitive because business has been affected badly			0
' residents said the changes they had seen so far were cosmetic			2
@entity146 said : ' i 'm glad @entity49 is there , it 's a great local facility for the people of @entity8 but you ca n't help feel it was created more for people from outside to come in , shop and leave without really entering the real @entity8			1
' it has been given its own district - @entity155 - and that helps create this idea that it is a separate from the town			0
' i do n't think the regeneration and tidying up that 's happened before the @entity12 has really had much impact on the wider @entity8 area			1
' another resident , @entity163 , added : ' all the money seems to be going into the @entity25 and the new shopping centre			2
' from our perspective it 's as though they are making sure the visitors get a good impression of @entity8 , but all the existing facilities across the road in the town centre are still run down but out of sight			0
' they did put some nice flower beds in the town centre the other day , so that is a start - but it still needs a good lick of paint and a lot of love and attention			0
' the £ 1.45bn @entity49 shopping mall has brought a huge boost , but critics fear other parts of @entity8 have been forgotten appeal : traders have called for more money to be invested in the @entity65 , which has been overshadowed by the new @entity49 development however , nearby @entity194 has already undergone a remarkable transformation as it reaps rewards from the @entity12 project			1
within a few months , a line of tatty shopfronts has been converted into a parade more typical of @entity201 or @entity202 than the @entity203 of @entity9			1

even the local @entity227 has had its ugly plastic fascia replaced with a sophisticated dark red paint job , a smaller , subtler logo , and a smart new awning			0
most of the businesses were fitted with internal shutters – sitting just within the windows rather than outside them – so the shopfronts can stay lit up at night			0
it is being funded by a £ 475,000 grant from the government ’s @entity239 as well as money from @entity242			2
a spokesman for @entity244 , which is responsible for @entity8 , said : ' nowhere else in @entity9 is changing at the scale and pace of @entity8			2
' over the next 15 years it will become a new metropolitan centre supporting many thousands of jobs			2
' alongside the development of the @entity25 and @entity253 's largest urban shopping centre at @entity49 , bold regeneration plans are set to create a competitive alternative to other @entity9 business districts such as @entity256 and @entity257			1
' @entity8 is already a major transport node with fast rail , tube and @entity262 connections to the @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity256 and new transport projects will provide further improved access to central @entity9 , the rest of the @entity268 and @entity253			1
' as the greatest show on earth comes to @entity9 in 2012 , the legacy of this year 's @entity12 and @entity270 is set to position @entity8 as a world - leading residential , business , leisure and tourism destination			2
new : the athletes ' village in the @entity25 gives a very different impression of @entity8 to the photographs of tatty buildings impressive : the @entity12 village is believed to have cost £ 1.1bn to develop makeover : the shops and restaurants on @entity194 have had their brickwork painted in preparation for the @entity12 a lick of paint : improvement work was carried out on @entity194 in time for the @entity12 ' already firmly established as a destination in its own right - 13.6 million people visited @entity49 during its first 14 weeks after opening in september 2011 - the immediate future will see the area continue to flourish with developments such as the @entity296 and @entity9 and @entity297 ( @entity298 ) £ 1.3 billion commercial district @entity300 ( @entity301 ) , as well as the transformation of the @entity303 after the @entity13			1
' the council operates a free disposal service for bulky waste			0
there is no excuse for residents dumping matresses and we will not tolerate this			0
' @entity313 , of @entity314 , asset managers on behalf of @entity65 owners @entity317 , said : ' the @entity65 is thriving , far from being overshadowed by our neighbour , we have seen our footfall increase significantly since @entity49 opened in 2011 and expect 24 million people to visit us this year			2
' ahead of the @entity12 , we have invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in a new entrance and frontage , improved the shopping areas and signage and are working with retailers to jointly make improvements to individual shops and storefronts			0
' we are also working to bring forward exciting development plans for the @entity65 and @entity330 , which will enhance both buildings and further contribute to @entity8 ’s resurgence			0

almost £ 9.3bn has been spent on the @entity13 , with 75 per cent earmarked for regeneration projects
@entity49 mall has created 10,000 jobs and attracted shoppers to *deprived* area of east @entity9
but residents say other parts have been forgotten and they ca n't see where the money has gone
