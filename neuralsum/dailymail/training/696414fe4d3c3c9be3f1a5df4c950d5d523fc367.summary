they also have a human housemate - @entity76			0
the pussycat pad started out with the installation of catwalks in 1995 after mr @entity6 was inspired by @entity94 's book @entity96 's @entity95 , according to @entity97			1
he admits he has spent between $ 40,000 and $ 50,000 on the catwalks alone			1

' at a certain point there was not turning back			0
it was like , this is their house and we 're living here with them ' mr @entity64 told @entity110			0

they 're architecturally interesting to me in the colors and we always try to do something interesting with the shapes			0
' mr @entity6 says he has received numerous calls about how best to design catwalks			1
the builder was unsure whether his pets would use the catwalks when he first built them , but now the animals can be heard scampering around on the ledges at odd hours of the night			2
' our house was built for us and our cats			0
the catwalks are fun for the cats , giving them lots of places to explore , hang out , etc , ' he said			2
