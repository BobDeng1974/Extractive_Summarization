by @entity0 the incredible moment a fisherman whooped for joy after freeing an enormous endangered whale that became trapped in heavy lines , has been caught on film			1
@entity7 jumped in the water armed with a long knife and a @entity11 camera initially to assess the situation			1
but as the giant whale loomed towards him , and a window to free the animal was presented , he reached out and sliced through the heavy rope , before the creature dived deep			1
speaking to pilot online , mr @entity7 said : ' being part of it was something bigger than me			1
' joined by two friends , the men were out fishing on a @entity42 's charter boat , based in @entity43 , @entity44 , and were about 50 miles off @entity46 coast when they had the extraordinary encounter			0
in an interview with the news service , @entity42 said he was first to spot the animal when they were fishing on friday			0
looming : as the enormous 50ft creature surfaced mr @entity7 said he felt ' scared ' as the whale reached him , the rope was clearly visible and the animal appeared to slow down it was n't ' uncommon ' he said to see whales in the area , but when he realised it was a right whale his interest was piqued			1
right whales are rarely seen since they were hunted almost to extinction in the 19th century			0
according to the @entity63 , there are thought to be only 400 in existence			0
as he watched the whale , he also realised there was a problem with some fishing gear , since two poly balls were being dragged close to each other ; ' that spells trouble in our field , ' he said			2
realising the whale was still close by , they turned the boat around and followed it , and saw that the heavy lines were tangled around its body			0
mr @entity42 said they watched the whale 's pattern of coming up for air and then his friend mr @entity7 jumped in			1
' i told him to be careful , it 's a very large animal , we do n't want whatever 's entangled , if it was entangled , to get around him , ' he told the news service			0
last moments of being trapped : the diver then reached forward and can be heard struggling to cut the rope before the whale is seen swimming away goodbye : the diver surfaces just in time to see the whale 's tail before it dived down deep at first mr @entity7 could n't see the whale , since he had jumped in in front of it			1
then he saw it looming out from the depths , ' almost like a submarine coming at me , ' he said			0
' it was kind of scary at first , ' he told the @entity109			0
but as the whale 's eyes came in line with his , the creature incredibly slowed , he said , allowing him time to reach forward and cut the rope as it passed			2
immediately , the pressure of the rope was released , and the tackle fell down into the depths			2
' @entity118 ' : diver mr @entity7 described the moment as one of he best in his life surfacing with the camera , mr @entity7 caught a final glimpse of the endangered whale 's tail before it submerged into the deep			1
although he said he realised he could have been in danger , mr @entity7 told the news service the moment felt right so he went for it			2
@entity109 points out that people are supposed to get authorization from the @entity132 , to free a tangled whale , and to notify the @entity63 .			0

@entity7 dived in armed with a knife and camera to asses
when the whale loomed at him he *instinctively* reached out to cut the rope
the endangered right whale then submerged into the depths as mr @entity7 is heard whooping for joy on the film
