@entity0 said that he has ' gigantic ' news about the president which he will announce on @entity3 @entity0 announced today that he has a ' gigantic ' bombshell about president @entity5 that he will reveal on wednesday			1
the billionaire real estate baron told @entity8 this morning that he had ' something very , very big concerning the president of the @entity11 '			0
' it 's going to be very big			0
i know one thing - you will cover it in a very big fashion , ' he added			0
@entity0 was n't giving away any clues , however , but only went on to say that it could ' possibly ' play a role in the election			1
he said h is waiting to tweet the ' large , bordering on gigantic ' news ' sometime probably wednesday '			1
@entity0 has been one of the most outspoken critics of the president and has also threatened to run against him			1
he has also toured @entity26 and said very clearly that he was seriously contemplating a presidential run			0
later he became something of a political touchstone for the various @entity31 candidates and eventually endorsed @entity32			0
he has been extremely vocal as a so - called birther conspiracy theorist , claiming that @entity5 was born outside of the @entity11 making him unable to run for president			1
in april 2011 , @entity0 announced that he paid to have a team of investigators to @entity50 to truly delve into the issue			1
in response , president @entity5 released the long form edition of his birth certificate after spending years refusing to do so			1
' normally , i would not comment on something like this ... i 've got other things to do , ' @entity5 said at the time			1
coming up : the mysterious website claims to have documents ( which are muzzed in the picture ) that reveal something about one of the two candidates but it is unclear which competition : a site called @entity68 claims to have revealing documents about one of the candidates this is the second time in as many months that @entity0 has said that he has a big surprise that would be damaging to the president , though the last time he said so - in the days leading up to the @entity76 - nothing came of it			1
@entity0 's announcement comes the same day as another surprise : a mysterious website called ' the october surprise ' says that it will release documents at 5.30pm on monday			2
very little is known about the creators of the site , the type of documents that they are referring to , or even their intended target			0
the @entity3 bio for the site simply reads : ' one of your presidential candidates is n't being honest with you			2
stay tuned to find out which one it is			0
' star : @entity0 , seen here with @entity97 who stars on @entity98 , has been a critic of @entity5 and his presidency for years political power : in february , @entity0 held a press conference endorsing @entity32 's presidential bid the big reveal will take place just hours before the third and final debate which is dedicated to foreign policy			1
as a result , spectators believe that the documents - which allegedly are muzzed and used as the picture on the october surprise sites - relate to a foreign issue			0
@entity8 host @entity113 : we have sources , @entity116 , that you have a large , bordering on gigantic announcement this week ? @entity0 : i do			2
@entity120 : what is it ? @entity0 : i 's going to be announced probably on wednesday but i have something very very big concerning the president of the @entity11			1
@entity120 : give us a hint ! @entity0 : i wo n't do that			2
@entity120 : just a little hint ! @entity0 : i wo n't do that , but i will talk to you probably on wednesday			1
that 's probably when i 'm going to announce ... it 's going to be very big , i know one thing : you will cover it in a very big fashion @entity8 host @entity136 : will it change the election ? @entity0 : possibly			1
@entity8 host @entity139 : is it personal or does it have to do with how he governs ? @entity0 : all in one , everything			2
bigger than anyone would know			0
' we ca n't predict media / campaign reaction , but the content is irrefutable , ' the creators wrote to one @entity3 inquiry			2
sensing a playful competition between the two reveals , @entity152 tweeted at @entity0 , saying that they beat him by making a big announcement			1
there is no telling if the two announcements are related in any way			0
while @entity152 is keeping both candidates in the dark , @entity0 was not as impartial			2
the billionaire businessman - turned - reality star and @entity5 have a barbed relationship on both sides			2
@entity0 repeatedly called @entity5 ' the worst president ever ' , and @entity5 referred to @entity0 as a ' carnival barker ' once he released the long form birth certificate			1
the president also spent a portion of his speech at the @entity170 's dinner in april 2011 taking jabs at @entity0			0
' now , i know that he ’s taken some flak lately , but no one is happier , no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the @entity116 , ' @entity5 said in the speech			0
' and that ’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter – - like , did we fake the moon landing ? what really happened in @entity183 ? and where are @entity185 and @entity186 ? ' over the past year , @entity0 's birther rhetoric has died down significantly and he has focused his attention to the @entity31 primary race , eventually supporting @entity32 's bid			0
though his endorsement came in may , the latest endorsement from the @entity0 clan came just three days ago			0
@entity116 's daughter @entity194 is married to @entity195 , the owner of the @entity196			0
while there was no mention of the paper 's ties to the real estate mogul , it did surprise some to see the paper reverse it 's 2008 endorsement of @entity5 and come out in favor of @entity32 just three days ago			0

@entity0 said that he has something ' very , very big ' to reveal about @entity5
said he will announce the news via @entity3 on wednesday
