‘ blood was just pouring and @entity15 ’s head was bleeding - there was blood all over the floor			1
also guilty : @entity51 , @entity10 's partner , was convicted of assisting an offender ‘ the worst thing was that , when he left , he did n’t just go running - he stood at the door looking , with a smug look on his face			1
