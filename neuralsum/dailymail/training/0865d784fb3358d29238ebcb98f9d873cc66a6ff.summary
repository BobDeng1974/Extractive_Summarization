@entity1 ’s increasing interest in sport will see @entity4 manager @entity3 being interviewed in a live video call from their @entity7 headquarters this week			1
@entity3 will be joined by the other home nation managers — @entity11 ’s @entity10 , @entity12 of @entity13 and @entity15 ’s @entity14 — in an initiative by @entity17 , who sponsor all four countries , ahead of the @entity21 qualifying campaign			1
@entity1 are expected at least to consider the digital content in the next @entity24 tender at the end of the year and are understood to be in the bidding for digital rights to major cricket tournaments			2
promotion : @entity3 will make his debut on @entity31 along with @entity12 and @entity10 the @entity32 have welcomed @entity3 ’s debut on @entity31 knowing they will need every possible media outlet to promote an unappetising set of @entity37 fixtures that follow on from a dismal @entity38			1
and before that , @entity4 are likely to attract their lowest crowd for an international at the new @entity42 when they face @entity43 in a friendly on september 3			1
however , despite @entity45 also putting in a bid , @entity42 remains the hottest of favourites to be awarded the final and semi-finals of @entity37 by @entity50 on september 19			2
@entity50 have again demonstrated how much they like @entity4 ’s national stadium by choosing it to host a workshop for football media chiefs from across @entity55 the day after the @entity43 game , for which the 130 representatives could have a row each to watch from , let alone a seat			1
barclays are not expected to renew their title backing of the @entity24 after next season			2
but they have still decided , after many years , to revamp their judging panel for the manager and @entity68 awards , with old timers @entity69 and @entity71 among those stood down			2
the winners used to be chosen quickly , followed by the longest of lunches at a private members club in @entity7			0
@entity76 are leading the chase for @entity79 ’s services if he retires at the end of the @entity82 season in october			1
@entity84 ’s record goalscorer , who made a big impression as an analyst for the @entity87 during the @entity38 , has still to decide whether to hang up his boots with the @entity89			0
if @entity79 does , @entity76 head a queue that includes @entity91 and @entity92			1
@entity79 will be able to command as much as £ 10,000 per programme , such is the market for big - name analysts , who have never had it so good with the openings available at home and in @entity99			1
wanted man : @entity76 and @entity91 will battle it out to sign @entity79 if the @entity102 chooses to retire @entity103 did n’t show much unison in their defeat against @entity106			1
this is despite manager @entity109 ’s bonding exercise of bringing in representatives from various club departments — including media spokeswoman @entity112 — to regularly eat with the players			0
bad start : @entity103 failed to get off t winning ways against @entity106 at the weekend @entity116 not world class - @entity118 @entity120 ’s @entity119 an intriguing new name has emerged as a possible challenger for the @entity124 presidency if @entity50 chief @entity125 declines to stand against @entity126 next year			0
@entity125 will announce his decision after consulting his @entity50 colleagues in @entity129 on august 28 , but the odds are against him wanting to take on @entity126			0
in that case , @entity50 will put up @entity133 ’s @entity132 or even pledge support for another potential election runner , @entity137 president @entity136			0
the combative @entity136 sits on @entity124 ’s executive committee and has been an outspoken critic of the way @entity126 runs @entity124 since @entity99 beat the @entity141 to host the @entity142			0
major rivals : @entity126 will face competition to hang on to his title of president of @entity124 there is a strong desire among @entity150 directors for chairman @entity151 to reveal his plans ahead of the appointment of the next chief executive			0
@entity151 may stand for another term in 2015 , split the chairmanship between international and domestic affairs with @entity159 ’s @entity158 , or concentrate entirely on @entity161 business			0
whatever @entity151 ’s ambitions , his fellow powerbrokers want him to declare his hand , while the incoming ceo will surely be keen to know his intentions before signing a contract .			0

the @entity4 boss will make his debut on @entity31 later this week
@entity3 will promote @entity4 *'s* @entity21 qualifying campaign games
@entity76 lead @entity91 in the race to appoint @entity79 as a *pundit*
