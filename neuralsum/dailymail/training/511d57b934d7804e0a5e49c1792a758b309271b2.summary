we ’ve been trying them out in training			0
they ’re really good to use			0
' they heat up almost instantaneously , you feel the temperature on your quads and hamstrings , and it really makes the difference			2
‘ as a sprinter i have lots of short events spread out through the day so it ’s essential that my muscles maintain temperature			2
' the zips mean you can take them off , literally at the last minute			0
you can actually cycle in them too , i ’ve tried that			0
