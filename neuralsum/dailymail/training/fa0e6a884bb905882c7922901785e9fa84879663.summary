kung - fu kicks are a common theme in this @entity4 @entity3 squad			0
@entity6 ’s exuberant celebration after scoring @entity4 ’s winner against @entity8 was the latest in a trilogy of kung - fu antics , as he acrobatically followed in the footsteps of midfielder @entity12 and boss @entity13			2
their kung - fu kicks were in slightly different circumstances though			0
so outraged was he that his @entity62 side were not awarded a free - kick during the 1995 @entity65 final against @entity66 , he mimicked @entity68 ’s high - foot challenge , jumping into the air in front of the fourth official and karate - kicking thin air			1
previous : @entity13 shows his frustrations in @entity62 's 1995 @entity65 final win against @entity66 not a red : @entity57 saw this challenge from @entity12 on @entity54 but only showed a yellow card painful : @entity12 's studs go straight into @entity80 midfielder @entity54 's stomach during the 2010 final @entity82 was a member of that @entity65 - winning @entity62 team , in fact the @entity20 striker scored the winning goal against @entity66 , in the 85th minute			1
and @entity82 is now part of @entity13 's coaching staff for the national side			0
after the final whistle @entity6 went straight to @entity82 and the pair embraced on the pitch at @entity93			0
history : @entity6 hugs @entity82 , who scored the winning goal in the 1995 @entity65 final			1

striker scored from the *penalty* spot in final minutes to seal 2 - 1 win
he ran straight over to the corner flag and kicked it in celebration
the image *conjured* up *memories* of @entity12 's tackle in 2010 final
and also @entity13 's antics in the 1995 @entity65 final
