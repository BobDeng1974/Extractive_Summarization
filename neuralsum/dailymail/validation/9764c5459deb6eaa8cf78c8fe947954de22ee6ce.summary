forget vivid shades and garish colours , the latest eyeshadow craze is to go nude — earthy and pink tones that mimic the natural colour of our eyelids			1
they make eyes look bigger and flatter older skin as they do n’t crease or highlight wrinkles			1
@entity12 of @entity13 is a fan — last week she revealed her favourite eye make - up is @entity16 ’s @entity15			1
here , @entity17 puts the latest nude eyeshadows to the test ... @entity21 ’s @entity20 naked palette , @entity16 , £ 38 , urbandecay.co.uk @entity23 : twelve rich shades from deep cream to charcoal are presented in a fabric case with a mirror			1
they are applied with a double - ended , scarily large brush			1
application : the cream looks startlingly white on my eyelids , but the bronze shades are easy to blend			1
though thick , both ends of the brush are delicate enough to apply to my lids without dropping product onto my face			2
the thinner of the two ends draws a thick , dark line above and below my lashes			2
i look in the mirror and my eyes are smoky enough to hang out in a jazz club , but not overly gothic , and it lasts through a dog walk with a sprinkling of sleet , which is impressive			1
9/10 @entity52 @entity53 , @entity54 , £ 14.99 , @entity55 @entity23 : a slender compact with ten shades , from beige through rosy tints to a dark purple			2
six have a subtle metallic sparkle			2
application : you ca n’t go wrong with these ! the shades are sheer so you do n’t need a steady hand to apply it and can layer them on confidently			2
the darker shades look menacingly gloomy in the compact , yet they are so sheer on the skin that i end up using a dark brown rather than a bronze			1
the final look is age - appropriate for me in my early 40s , and it is light enough to wear in the day			2
when i catch sight of myself in changing room mirrors while out shopping , i look ten times less tired than usual			0
8/10 neutral tones @entity82 , no 7 , £ 11 , @entity55 @entity23 : eight @entity84 - style shades : a deep cream , four similar - looking browns and three shades of grey			0
application is via a double - ended brush			0
application : the lightest shade looks mask - white on my eyelid			0
a lot of powder comes away as i swirl the brush over the eyeshadow			0
i find the brush too thick to apply a line along my lashes and it gives me a bruised look under the eyes			1
4/10 @entity105 @entity106 , @entity107 , £ 37 , smashbox.co.uk @entity23 : there are 14 daunting looking colours with a double - ended blending brush			0
application : i am amazed at how easily the brush swoops over my eyelids			0
i play around with three shades of bronze			0
but then i get over-confident : i attempt to draw a line with the charcoal and end up looking as though i ’ve been up a chimney			0
6/10 portable touch - up eyes uncovered @entity121 , collection , £ 3.99 , superdrug.com @entity23 : the budget option : the case is cardboard with no mirror			1
the applicator is double - ended , but consists of just two flimsy - feeling foam pads			0
there are six matte colours , ranging from nude to charcoal			1
application : as i smear the brush around the powder , i gouge a chunk out of the charcoal			0
the powder sinks into my wrinkles			0
it looks as though my six - year - old applied my make - up			1

the latest craze is said to make your eyes look bigger and flatter old skin
