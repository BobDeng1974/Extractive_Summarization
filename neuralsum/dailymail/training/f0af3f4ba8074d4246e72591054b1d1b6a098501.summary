the brave astronauts who risked their lives to venture into the unknown have been hailed as the heroes of the space race			0
but the incredible infrastructure that sent these men and women into orbit has largely been forgotten , leaving haunting reminders of one of humanity 's greatest achievements			0
for the best part of half a century , one photographer has been on an adventure across the @entity16 to capture abandoned @entity18 sites before they are lost to their environment			2
' i was asked , in 1997 , to photograph the newly opened @entity29 , including access to a high - lift for vantage points like this view of the center @entity25 engine , ' said mr @entity36 @entity36 , 56 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , has dedicated 25 years to the personal project and has now compiled his life 's work in a book , ' @entity37 '			1
' i think that many children of my era wanted to be astronauts , ' said mr @entity36 , a photography instructor at the @entity47 in @entity38			1
' unfortunately , because of my need for glasses in the third grade i knew becoming an astronaut was not an option			0
well , glasses and about 40 iq points			0
' my parents would wake me and my sisters up early to watch the launches from @entity58			0
the nuts and bolts : pictured is a cable tunnel at the @entity63 19 in @entity27 , pictured in 1993			2
often overlooked in early space history , the @entity64 provided the basic research for many critical steps in proving that men could survive long duration flights in space and testing the orbital rendezvous procedures which would eventually be used in the @entity73 program space history : mr @entity36 has visited 16 space launch sites , research facilities , and museums , in @entity77 , @entity27 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85			1
pictured is a wind tunnel test chamber at the @entity88 in @entity77 ' as an adult it has been an amazing experience to explore and photograph these historic launch complexes			1
' mr @entity36 has visited 16 space launch sites , research facilities , and museums , in @entity77 , @entity27 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85			1
' @entity58 has the most facilities remaining , though many of them have been demolished or repurposed since i began the project , ' he said ' @entity99 is my favourite			2
@entity99 is the site of a number of unmanned test launches of the @entity105 and @entity106 rocket			1
' the first manned @entity73 mission , @entity73 7 , lifted off from @entity99			2
it is also the site of the @entity111 capsule fire that killed @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
snapped : a fuel tank for a lunar module pictured at the @entity117 in 2002			0
' as an adult it has been an amazing experience to explore and photograph these historic launch complexes , ' said @entity36 space race : on the left are bolts pictured at @entity124 at @entity58			1
the right image shows a plug board at @entity127 , also located in @entity58 flooded : this is an image of a large square girder in a flooded compartment beneath @entity131 19 , the @entity133 facility at @entity58			0
' i was intrigued by the colour and the light , ' said mr @entity36			1
' what i could n't have predicted were the swirling reflections of light in the water coming from openings in the roof			0
they look like little galaxies ' the blockhouses , launch towers , tunnels , test stands , and control rooms are rapidly giving way to the elements and demolition			2
' by my estimates , fully half of the facilities i have photographed no longer exist , ' said mr @entity36			1
' the costs involved in restoring , maintaining , and securing these sites are enormous			0
' most of these historic facilities are located on secure military or @entity18 facilities , which drastically limits access by the public			2
mr @entity36 wants to capture these amazing facilities before they are lost forever			1
' there is a spiritual quality to @entity99			1
the launch pedestal with its large round opening to the sky gives it the look of some ancient astronomical archaeological ruin - something like @entity172			2
' in 1984 , mr @entity36 moved to @entity27 's @entity173 to teach photography and was contacted by an environmental engineer at @entity58			1
the engineer needed help disposing of old photographic chemicals , which required a visit to @entity180 , the @entity64 launch facility			0
' i knew immediately i wanted to photograph the decaying launch structure , and i soon realised there were other deactivated launch facilities on @entity58 that i would also want to photograph , ' he said			2
it was down to this chance encounter that led mr @entity36 to spend a large part of his life travelling across country to document the forgotten history of the space program			1
' you have to understand that all of these launch complexes and test sites are on secure military bases or @entity18 and contractor operated facilities with numerous security considerations and hazardous operations , ' he said			2
decommissioned : ' i made this photograph of @entity203 while it was being decomissioned , ' said mr @entity36			1
' the mobile service towers of @entity205 and @entity206 were imploded in 2007			0
@entity207 on @entity58 sent @entity208 , @entity209 , and @entity211 missions on their way to explore the , oon and the planets of our solar system ' haunting : pictured on the left is @entity219 9 at @entity58 pictured in 1990			0
on the right is a @entity18 logo at @entity222 in @entity27 revived : a launch ring restored at the @entity224 34			2
' in 1998 , the launch ring at @entity99 was sandblasted and painted to protect it from weathering , ' said mr @entity36			1
; i had been trying for years to capture the spiritual quality of this site			1
i made this photograph near sunset with the blue sky reflecting on the launch pedestal and the last pink rays of sunlight illuminating the ring and clouds behind ' ' you ca n't just say to @entity18 , ' i would like to run around on your secure facility and make a bunch of pictures			0
' ' it was n't hard to get out and photograph for a short period of time , but i knew i need extended time and numerous visits to accomplish the project i had in mind			0
mr @entity36 said it took about two years of attempting different avenues to get the access he required			1
' once i was able to make a couple of excursions and then show the work to @entity18 and the @entity258 , they were supportive of my visits , ' he said			0
mr @entity36 , who successfully raised over his $ 25,000 ( Â£ 16,000 ) target through @entity261 to part - fund his work , said he plans to continue photographing abandoned space centres when they become available			1
looking for shelter : a dome at the @entity267 in the @entity26 is pictured			0
the floor is set on springs to isloate the occupants from whatever explosions which may be occuring above them as they seek shelter launch site : the @entity63 19 , @entity58			2
' this was the first abandoned launch pad i visited , ' said mr @entity36			1
' it was 1988 , and i was amazed that the light bulbs on the erector were mostly intact more than 22 years after the last @entity63 mission			0
unlike all the other service towers at the pads on @entity58 , the erector at @entity283 was hinged at the base			0
it was lowered before every launch ' abandoned : mr @entity36 managed to capture these liquid fuel tanks used for the @entity73 which landed the first twelve humans on the @entity289 from 1969 to 1972			1
' their were two of these fuel pressure spheres near the entrance to @entity293 , ' he said			0
' one has been repurposed and is now used to support @entity296 rocket launches			0
the other sphere was removed ' inspiration : pictured is a blockhouse - a isolated fort - at the @entity302 at @entity58 in @entity27			0
' these abandoned space launch and test facilities bring to mind other archeological sites			1
this blockhouse reminded me of a pyramid or ziggurat , ' said mr @entity36			1

*stunning* images were taken by photographer @entity36 , 56 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , over 25 years
he visited 16 space launch sites and research facilities in areas including @entity77 , @entity27 and @entity85
@entity99 is his favourite , as it is site of unmanned test launches for the historic @entity25 rocket
' there is a spiritual quality to @entity99 , ' said mr @entity36 , adding that it reminds him of @entity172
