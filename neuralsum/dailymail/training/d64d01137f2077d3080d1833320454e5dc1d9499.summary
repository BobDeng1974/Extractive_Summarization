an ugly feud over an $ 8billion fortune amassed by the family who control the @entity4 pest control empire is set to come to a head in a bitter court battle			1
the grandchildren of company founder @entity8 , who went from rural poverty in depression - era @entity10 to owning @entity13 's biggest extermination firm , have rounded on their father and uncle , who now control the company			2
the four children of @entity18 , the ceo of @entity19 , which owns all of @entity4 's 400 locations and nine other pest control businesses - are suing him and his brother @entity22 over their inheritance			1
@entity37 , who spent years at @entity19 and was @entity26 until being fired , told @entity43 the lawsuit is an attempt to escape a family ' cult ' which wants to hire private investigators and conduct drugs tests on young younger generations before they are allowed their inheritance			0
he said : ' we ’d put up with a lot			0
we did n’t want to have our kids and grandkids go through that , or worse			0
we were unwilling to have them rule from the grave			0
' together , the claimants allege that the elder generation has deprived them of their rightful inheritance via a web of trust funds with arcane and intrusive eligibility requirements			0
all of the @entity8 grandchildren - there are another five on @entity22 's side of the family - had trust funds started for them by @entity8 , who died in 1991			1
patriarch : @entity8 , pictured , started the family business which is now worth billions			1
he died in 1991 the @entity4 pest control business was started in 1901 by @entity74 immigrant @entity73 , but the @entity8 family bought it out in 1967 and have controlled it via @entity19 ever since			1
in @entity38 's lifetime the company grew hugely , and when he died it was worth billions with an organized plan for distributing the money to the next generation			1
but in 2000 , @entity18 and @entity22 imposed new requirements on the funds , requiring their children to complete ' meaningful activity ' such as work or education to qualify for annual payments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars			2
all the grandchildren accepted the regime - and many failed the tests over the years to come so missed out on millions of dollars			0
but the younger generation was outraged when in 2010 the two elder @entity8 men tried to impose a new set of conditions on the payments			1
this included a ' monitoring program ' which allowed the men to hire private investigators , access medial records and make credit and drugs tests in order to ensure the children met the criteria			2
outraged , @entity18 's four children hired lawyers and have dragged the family through numerous court battles without resolving the dispute			1
path to riches : @entity31 ( left ) and founder @entity8 ( right ) are seen in 1968 , when @entity19 began trading on the @entity114 @entity22 's five children did not join in - but the litigant @entity8 members allege their five cousins were paid off with $ 9million as a reward for not complaining			1
the feud has split the family apart - @entity124 has divorced his wife , the two sets of cousins no longer speak and @entity18 , now 70 , reportedly celebrated his recent remarriage with none of his children present			2
lawyers for @entity130 and @entity31 said : ' the plaintiffs ’ lawsuits are motivated by greed and self - interest '			0
according to court papers , @entity22 's five children submitted supporting statements describing the litigant children as a ' disgruntled and diminishing minority of family members ' who are violating their grandfather 's intentions			0
the children 's suit has made its way through county and appeal courts in @entity10 , and had a hearing at the @entity10 @entity148 in january of this year			0
the next stage is reportedly due to take place in 2015 .			0

but @entity18 's children are suing the men for *withholding* money they owe

reports say elder @entity8 men want to use investigators , impose drugs checks and use medical records to see if children *deserve* inheritance
