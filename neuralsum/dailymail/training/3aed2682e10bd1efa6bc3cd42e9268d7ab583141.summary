@entity0 and @entity1 quit their stable jobs , sold their possessions , packed up their belongings and embarked on the road trip of a lifetime			1
departing from their home in the @entity11 in march , the couple journeyed first through @entity12 , across @entity13 to @entity14 on two motorbikes , covering 16 countries in three months			1
@entity1 , a photographer , has been documenting their adventures in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and more , capturing breathtaking images along the way and documenting them on their blog , @entity27			1
riding off into the sunset : @entity0 ( pictured in @entity29 ) and @entity1 are on an epic road trip an extraordinary adventure : the couple initially rode from @entity33 to @entity14 , covering 16 countries in three months spectacular : @entity0 and @entity1 journeyed through @entity12 across @entity13 taking pictures like this , in @entity21 , along the way the adventure did not end there , though			1
falling head over heels for their new lifestyle , @entity0 , 33 , and @entity1 , 27 , have no plans to go ' home ' anytime soon			1
they have been based in @entity46 since june and this week depart for a new adventure in @entity48			1
the couple 's nomadic lifestyle has come with its challenges			1
they tell @entity53 of going a week without any shower or toilet facilities , off - roading from daybreak to nightfall in remote regions , and facing sandstorms , freezing temperatures and long stretches without encountering another soul			0
' in @entity20 we were stuck because of heavy snow and a lovely family let us stay in their house for days , ' @entity0 and @entity1 say			1
' we felt so welcome , and even though these people are quite poor they welcome you as their own family			0
' the great outdoors : they faced sandstorms , freezing temperatures , and no showers or toilets for days in @entity14 ( pictured ) jaw - dropping : they have encountered incredible scenery , such as the ' @entity79 ' in @entity80 remote : the adventurers followed the river border between @entity83 and @entity21 ( pictured ) for two days but the real adventure began , they say , in @entity21			2
' we already had a lot of bad roads , but @entity21 was hard			0
no shower or toilet for a week , sleeping at people 's homes on the ground , high altitude , snow , only soup with potato for dinner and eggs in the morning			0
the couple spent two days following the @entity83 border , only separated by a small river			2
and @entity14 was even harder			0
' almost no asphalt , just a lot of small sandy paths or washboard roads , ' say @entity0 and @entity1 , remembering days where they only managed to travel 150km , calling it ' mentally and physically challenging '			1
' at some points it felt like there was no ending			0
our navigation did n’t work , we did n’t know where we were and the roads were really bad that sometimes we could only drive 10 to 20 km per hour			0
' the road ahead : @entity0 , 33 , and @entity1 , 27 , sold their possessions and left their lives in @entity33 behind nomadic life : both of them had stable , secure jobs before embarking on their adventure isolated : the couple went long stretches without encountering other people			1
pictured setting up camp in @entity29 in @entity14 , the couple encountered @entity131 adventurer @entity130 , who made headlines in august when he became the first person to walk solo from the country 's border with @entity136 to its @entity138 boundary , camping together for three days			2
@entity19 , the reveal , felt like a ' summer holiday ' , in which they enjoyed ' nice people , the best food , good roads and beautiful nature			2
' we noticed that right after every border you directly notice you ’re in another country			0
even though the change is slower than travelling by plane , every country has its own uniqueness			0
' above the clouds : one of their bikes pictured at the highest pass at 4,600 metres in @entity21 ' open to new opportunities ' : the couple marvel at the welcoming people they met along their way			2
pictured : @entity163 while there have bumps along the road , the couple say their incredible journey has only strengthened their three and a half - year relationship , insisting that , remarkably , they ' never fight ' while on the road and do n't irritate each other ... except for when @entity1 is slow to get going in the mornings			1
they say : ' we 've formed a really good team			0
@entity0 is calm and never afraid			1
@entity1 is more impulsive , but also good in finding information			1
in difficult situations we always were on the same page			0
' travelling changes your view on life , and it is great to share this			0
it ’s a completely new lifestyle we were experiencing			0
being with each other 24 hours a day is not easy , and we had to get to know each other in this new lifestyle			0
' the couple say that travelling has always been a conversation since they met , but that it was n't until last year that the idea of a motorbike road trip formed			1
committed : they say their journey has only strengthened their three and a half year relationship changing scenes : it has n't been all remote roads for @entity0 and @entity1 , who also travelled through cities like this in @entity80 it was during a motoring trip in @entity206 last summer that the fantasy of the epic journey arose			1
' we talked about our lives and what we really wanted to do , ' they say			0
' we knew that we had to do something drastic to be happy with our lives			0
unsatisfied with their jobs and with no children on the immediate agenda , they made the decision at @entity220 that they were ready for change			2
' we wanted more adventure and less security			2
to get the most out of ourselves and be open for new opportunities			0
' the duo plan to purchase a new bike in @entity227 and ' just drive ' , with a indefinite plan to ride from the @entity229 to the sea - undoubtedly capturing beautiful pictures along the way			2
endless journey : the couple ( right ) are departing for @entity48 this week , and hope to continue their adventure for the foreseeable future			1

@entity0 and @entity1 sold their possessions , quit their jobs and embarked on an epic adventure
couple , currently in @entity46 , have no plans to go home soon with a road trip across @entity48 next
