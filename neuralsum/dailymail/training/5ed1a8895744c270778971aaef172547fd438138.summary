@entity0 defiantly pushed forward with the overhaul of @entity2 this afternoon as he announced more radical changes to the site with completely new profile pages covering years before the site even existed			1
the site founder unveiled some of the biggest changes in the site 's history with the introduction of the new ' timeline ' profile pages at the company 's f8 conference in @entity17			1
the announcement came as @entity0 continues to face wide scale anger from users at the way that the news feed was changed at the start of the week			1
the timeline can go back to include years before @entity2 even existed , so users can add photos and events from , say 1995 when they got married or 1970 when they were born			1
@entity0 said the new profile page had been designed so that , ' you can tell the whole story of your life on a single page '			1
the redesigned pages have a more magazine - like photo - heavy feel , with a large ' cover photo ' at the top of the page			2
on the right of the page there will be a timeline that breaks down all posts from a person 's time on @entity2 and allows viewers to jump back to people 's earliest posts with a break down month - by - month			1
features : the profile page has closer integration with apps such as @entity74 and @entity75 , allowing users to watch films and listen to music on @entity2 for the first time , the site will allow you to add photos and content from before @entity2 existed in a new ' @entity85 ' section			1
in his presentation , @entity0 showed how to add a baby photo at the beginning of your timeline			2
' it 's fun and easy to fill out your timeline , ' said @entity0			2
in other changes to the profile page , users will be able to choose what is featured on their timelines , with the ability to star favourites to double their size or hide things altogether			2
@entity0 took the stage after a humorous skit , in which @entity103 actor @entity102 impersonated him			2
changes : the new ' timeline ' profiles will look more like an online scrapbook with a much larger space at the top of the page for a profile picture the real @entity0 looked considerably more playful and at ease than he has in past events , suggesting he is growing into his role as the public face of @entity2			1
but he quickly got down to business as he introduced the timeline as ' the story of your life - all your stories , all your apps and a new way to express who you are			0
' expanding on its ubiquitous ' like ' buttons , @entity0 said @entity2 will now let users connect to things even if they do n't want to ' like ' them			1
' we are making it so you can connect to anything you want			0
now you do n't have to like a book , you can just read a book , ' he said			0
' you do n't have to like a movie ; you can just watch a movie			0
' timeline : the right hand side of the site has been changed to show a chart of posts from the past the latest changes come days after @entity2 overhauled the news feed feature , which largely succeeded in goading its 750 million users into a fury			1
users have been infuriated by the overhaul of the site with dozens of @entity2 groups set up to protest the changes - some with thousands of members			1
on @entity2 's official blog more than 7,000 users have offered comments on the new ' update ' to the news service - many of them furious rants in capitals - and a mere 1,800 users have ' liked ' the service			1
tech sites are offering ' workarounds ' to disable the new features - and many users have said on @entity165 and @entity2 that they are switching to using @entity2 on smartphones such as @entity167 , where the the new @entity168 and @entity169 have not yet been added to the apps			1
the focus of most people 's anger seems to be the arbitrary way in which the site ' chooses ' which stories might be ' important ' to you - general opinion is that the site seems to invariably choose wrongly			0
all change : @entity0 has made several announcements this week as the site has faced competition from the likes of @entity185 the new update to the site ' splits ' news into ' top stories ' - the company declined to explain how these are chosen for each individual - and a ' news ticker ' that crawls up the right side of the screen , adding updates as they come in			1
' i want to choose my own news and my own friends			0
i do not need @entity2 to choose these items for me , ' said one commenter			0
it 's taking me much longer now to find the news i really want , now that @entity2 has decided incorrectly that some algorithm knows better than i do , ' said another			2
although @entity2 is still the world â€™s largest social networking site with 750million users , it has been under pressure from @entity207 and other media sites for a number of months , especially since the launch of @entity185			1
watch the video spoof : @entity103 's @entity213 introduces the new fake features while pretending to be @entity0 before @entity0 launched the latest changes to the site , ' @entity103 ' cast member @entity102 took to the stage to introduce two new fake features			2
wearing @entity0 's usual attire of a hoodie and sandals , @entity102 did his impersonation of the @entity2 founder , which has become a regular feature on the show			1
' let 's get to the part where i brag about user growth , ' @entity102 said			0
' we continue to expand to the point where we 've stop counting you guys			0
' it 's more than the population of @entity240 , the cast of ' @entity235 ' and the amount of people claiming they came up with @entity2			2
burn ! ' @entity102 then introduced the ' i 'm not really friends with these people ' section of the site			0
the fake @entity0 said the new feature would be a place on your friends list to put people that you feel obligated to be friends with , but that you do not really like			2
' it 's the perfect place to put awkward friends from middle school , older drunk women you meet at charity events , racist neighbours , and aunts , ' he said			0
then he revealed the ' slow poke ' , which is a poke that moves so slowly that you can take it back if for example you gave the poke while drunk			0
' the @entity265 ' gives users 24 hours to ' realise you 're an idiot ' before it is sent to the friend			0
the real @entity0 then took to the stage interrupting the monologue saying , ' drop the act now , man '			0
' the slow poke is n't even a real feature , ' @entity0 said while chuckling			0
' the deal was i was supposed to feed you real information through the earpiece			0
' &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; lt ; br / &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; gt ;			0
