a hair - loss medication reportedly tried by @entity2 may cause prolonged and possibly irreversible impotence , scientists have claimed			0
the recent findings come after one patient bravely stepped forward to reveal the drug left him with no sex drive and even shrank his genitals			1
@entity10 , 30 , was prescribed with the drug propecia after he worried he could be losing his hair			2
he said he only planned to take the pill for a year			0
concern : men worried about losing their hair may consider treatments such as @entity18			2
however in the @entity20 the drug label warns about possible ' persistent ' sexual side effects however , just five months after he started taking it in may 2011 he found he was completely impotent and his testes also became smaller			1
worried , he consulted his doctor and was told the symptoms would disappear after he stopped taking the drug			2
but he says a year on and nothing has changed			0
it will come as no surprise to dr @entity31 from the @entity32			0
he recently published a study in the @entity34 , that found the ingredient finasteride , which is found in @entity18 , can cause persistent sexual dysfunction , including low sexual desire , erectile dysfunction and problems with orgasms			1
the male pattern baldness drug is manufactured by @entity42 and was approved by the @entity43 in 1997			2
while labeling on the medication in the @entity48 currently warns about possible reversible sexual side effects , there is no reference to the effects being persistent , dr @entity31 said			2
however , other countries including the @entity20 and @entity53 do require medical companies to include the ' persistent risk ' warning on the labeling			2
it was reported that @entity2 started taking the medication in 2009 after he became sick of other footballer 's jibes about his receding hairline			0
he has since had a hair transplant			0
unfortunate side - effects ? @entity2 was reported to be taking @entity18 in 2009			2
it has since been linked with impotence dr @entity31 first became aware of the problems caused by finasteride several years ago when he encountered several men who reported they had developed sexual dysfunction while taking the medication			1
' it ’s been very frustrating for a lot of these men because they ’ve sought care from medical professionals who have looked at the literature and have not seen a risk of persistent sexual dysfunction , ' says dr @entity31			1
' so a lot of these patients have been told to see psychiatrists and psychologists and that it ’s all in their head			0
' dr @entity31 then noticed that men had reported sexual dysfunction for months even after they stopped taking the medication			1
' i came across a website called propeciahelp.com with more than 1,400 registered users - many young healthy men who developed the same sexual side effects from finasteride - and i discovered that nobody had published a series looking at these men - who they are , how long the sexual side effects lasted , what types			0
' dr @entity31 ’s study included results from interviews with 71 men aged 21 to 46 years old to assess how long they took finasteride , the type and duration of sexual side effects and their sexual frequency before and after the medication			1
dr @entity31 discovered that 94 per cent developed low libido , 92 per cent developed erectile dysfunction and decreased arousal , and 69 per cent developed problems with orgasm			0
on average , the men used finasteride for approximately 28 months but experienced persistent sexual side effects for an average of 40 months , from the time they ceased taking the medication to the time of the interview			1
dr @entity31 also found that the average number of sexual episodes per month dropped after finasteride use			0
' it turns out that almost all the men had multiple sexual function problems , ' says dr @entity31			0
' before finasteride use , the men experienced average sexual activity of approximately 26 episodes per month , but after use , it came down to approximately eight per month - an almost two - thirds reduction			2
' twenty per cent of patients i interviewed experienced persistent sexual dysfunction for more than five years , which makes me wonder if their persistent sexual dysfunction is permanent , ' he adds			1
controversial : @entity42 says no evidence has proved a causal relationship between @entity18 and long - lasting sexual dysfunction this was certainly mr @entity10 's experience			1
he told @entity142 : ' i kept expecting the side effects to go away , but they did not , they only got worse			0
' mr @entity10 said before he took the drug he was engaged and worked as a public health researcher at a university in @entity148			0
after he developed symptoms his fiancee broke off the engagement and he said he had to resign from his job because of cognitive problems			0
he said he is angry no one warned him the drug could have such lasting effects			2
' even if the side effects are rare , that does n't mean that i should not have been warned			0
i did have a life before this , ' he told @entity142			0
dr @entity31 said roughly 5 per cent of men who take medicine will experience sexual dysfunction , and of those ' it ’s hard to tell how many will experience persistent symptoms '			1
' we know that this is a potential problem , but we ca n’t quantify what the exact risk is			0
i ca n’t tell a man if he has a 1 - in - 100 chance , or a 1 - in - 1000 chance of developing persistent sexual dysfunction , but it ’s pretty clear there ’s a relationship here , ' he says			1
@entity182 can be used as an alternative to @entity18 - applied directly on the skin , it does not get absorbed by body and thus does not cause sexual side effects - but dr. @entity31 says @entity18 is very effective in treating hair loss and thus is commonly prescribed			1
so dr @entity31 says it is crucial physicians treating male pattern hair loss discuss the possibility of persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride with their patients			1
' i think it ’s very important that doctors who are prescribing this medicine talk about potential risks , so men can make an informed decision , ' he said			0
in a statement , @entity42 said no evidence has proved a causal relationship between @entity18 and long - lasting sexual dysfunction			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity42 believes that @entity18 ( finasteride ) has demonstrated safety and efficacy profiles and that the product labeling appropriately describes the benefits and risks of the drug to help inform prescribing			1
' a causal relationship between the use of @entity18 and continued sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of treatment has not been established			1
we encourage patients to talk with their doctor if they have any questions or concerns about their health , or about @entity18			1

doctor reveals twenty *percent* of patients he interviewed for @entity18 study experienced persistent sexual dysfunction for more than five years
' i should have been warned ' , says patient who claims drug shrunk his genitals
