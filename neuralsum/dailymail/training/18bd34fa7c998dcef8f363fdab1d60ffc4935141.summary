by @entity0 since the dawn of air travel , we 've felt guilty for gorging on fried food in dingy departure lounges in the middle of the night			1
but red - eyed passengers finally have an excuse to scoff themselves silly - because a carb - heavy fry - up could help conquer jet lag			2
scientists have said foods which kick - start a big release of insulin , such as carbohydrates , could be crucial to resetting our body clock when we get out of sync with our natural cycle			1
eat up ... then go to bed ! researchers in @entity22 claim to have found a link between insulin - triggered when we eat many foods , including carbohydrates - and the resetting of our circadian rhythms which govern sleep the researchers at @entity31 , @entity22 , were trying to find ways of disrupting circadian rhythms , which govern how much our bodies want to sleep and when			1
it has long been known that darkness prompts the body to feel sleepy by sending signals to a central ' pacemaker ' in the brain			0
in the same way , natural light makes us feel more awake			0
but the researchers also said each of our millions of cells has its own miniature sleep pattern which , when they are all taken together , contribute to the body overall			1
they found insulin could kick - start the tiny sleep patterns within each cell and encourage our bodies to change the time at which we want to fall asleep			1
the study , published in the journal @entity56 , tested the theory on mice which were fed unusually large meals during the night			0
airline food : passengers on a red - eye flight could now have a good excuse for gorging on unhealthy meals scans of the rodents ' liver cells found insulin , the hormone released by the pancreas when they ate food high in sugar and starch , had an effect on the cells ' circadian rhythms			1
dr @entity77 , one of the lead researchers on the project , said : ' in short , insulin may help the stomach clock synchronize with mealtime			0
' for example , for jet lag , dinner should be enriched with ingredients promoting insulin secretion , which might lead to a phase advance of the circadian clock , whereas breakfast would be the opposite			2
' there would be side effects to using insulin to treat insomniacs , dr @entity77 warned			0
and any treatment would not be as effective on patients with type 2 diabetes , who have problems producing the hormone			0
the researcher added his theory needs more testing before it can be seen as conclusive			0
but he claimed the research could be crucial to the world 's health - as defying our natural sleep patterns ' carries a significant risk of diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , sleep disorders , and cancer ' .			2

research was carried out by scientists from @entity31 in @entity22
it has long been known light *affects* the circadian rhythms of sleep
but scientists *experimented* on mice to see if food could also have an effect
tiny circadian rhythms existed inside cells triggered by insulin , they found
hormone could help ' reset ' the body clock - helping air passengers
