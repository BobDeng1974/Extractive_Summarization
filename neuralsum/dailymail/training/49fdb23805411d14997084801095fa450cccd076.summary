by @entity0 the most dangerous criminals will be tracked via satellites orbiting the earth			0
the system is already being used to monitor immigration cases such as @entity6 new gps tags set to be introduced in april will mean paedophiles can be banned from areas where children gather			1
the system , which monitors the most dangerous criminals via satellites orbiting the earth , will set off an alarm if the sex offenders go too near a school			1
@entity17 , which has already been tested on a number of high profile criminals , and immigrations cases including @entity21 hate preacher @entity6 , will allow officials to track offenders around the clock for the first time			1
probation chiefs say it will be used on the most high - risk offenders freed early from jail or given a community sentence , and has already been trialled on high - risk offenders in @entity32 and @entity33			1
officials will be able to track offenders by following dots across a map on their computer screens			1
it will detail exactly where they have been , how fast they are travelling , and whether they are in a vehicle or on foot			0
authorities will also be able to set ' exclusion zones ' for each offender			0
it means paedophiles could be barred from school areas , with the tag alerting officials by setting off an alarm if they go too close			0
justice secretary @entity54 said : ' @entity17 will allow us to keep a much closer watch on high risk and persistent offenders , who cause so much harm			1
' monitoring the movements of dangerous and repeat offenders will be vital in cutting crime , creating a safer society with fewer victims and ultimately offering greater protection and reassurance to the public			1
' @entity69 's current tags , introduced in 1999 , are used to ensure offenders obey a night - time curfew			1
but they can not track a person 's daytime movements			1
cost issues and technical difficulties saw a similar idea abandoned in 2007 , as it was found that criminals could block the gps signal by standing near tall buildings or even trees			0
the technology was also trialed by the @entity83 on medium and high - risk patients during a pilot scheme in 2010			1
it is hoped extending the scheme to criminals would help ease the pressure on @entity69 's overflowing prisons			2
officials will be able to track offenders by following dots across a map on their computer screens			2
it will detail exactly where they have been , how fast they are travelling , and whether they are in a vehicle or on foot there are around 22,500 offenders electronically monitored at any one time			2
during the financial year 2010/11 , 116,000 subjects were tagged - nine per cent more than the previous financial year			2
a @entity107 spokesman said the cost of the contract was still being negotiated but last year electronic monitoring cost Â£ 117m			0
he added : ' this is one of the largest electronic monitoring schemes in the world , and is regarded as delivering a successful and high quality service			0
' new contracts for electronic monitoring services due to be awarded in spring 2013 will allow us to improve delivery and introduce the most sophisticated and advanced technology in the world			2
' they will also represent better value for taxpayers			0
properly administered , new generation tagging can promote improved behaviour and give victims greater reassurance			0
' the new contracts will be awarded in spring 2013 and this will be followed by a mobilisation period in which the gps tags will be introduced			0

the same *device* is being used to monitor movements of immigration cases - such as @entity6
satellite tagging has already been trialled on some of the country 's highest risk offenders
the system will be launched in april 2013
