by @entity0 published : 03:51 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 08:12 est , 27 november 2012 a retired @entity2 scientist is hoping to make history by sailing a four foot remote - controlled model boat across the @entity5			2
@entity6 , 65 , hopes to become the first person to sail an unmanned craft - named @entity8 - 6,000 miles across the ocean as part of the @entity11 , launched in 2010			1
the 30lb home made boat , constructed for less than £ 450 and put together in @entity6 's games room at his @entity17 , @entity16 , home , will attempt to sail the seas powered by wind and a solar - powered gps and steering system			1
@entity6 has already mapped out his route and will depart @entity45 on saturday heading along the @entity46 before heading south towards the @entity47 and then off towards the @entity48 , hoping to eventually land in @entity49 , @entity50			1
the painstaking voyage , which will see @entity6 given hourly updates on the boat 's progress along its pre-programmed route via satellite , could take as long as six months			1
resilient : @entity6 's craft has already sailed around 5,000 miles , albeit on the still waters of @entity42 near @entity43 slow progress : the journey to the shores of @entity62 will not be a quick one - it 's expected to take six months he says that a miniature @entity33 figure placed on board the tiny boat is to poke fun at academics who take the challenge ' far too seriously			1
' @entity6 told the @entity71 : ' i got hooked about four years ago			0
i did n’t even play with model boats when i was a boy			0
' i sometimes tinker on the boat in the lounge , but am usually banished to the games room by my wife			0
' helped by a team that includes a veteran of @entity81 's @entity80 , mr @entity6 seems to be confident that he will complete the challenge - he has already programmed the return route into the boat 's navigation system			2
the first @entity11 competition took place on a lake near @entity89 , @entity90 in june 2006 with three teams taking part			2
a team from @entity94 attempted the first transatlantic crossing in september 2010 setting sail from @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99			0
but the team lost its track of the craft off the north west coast of @entity99			0
the challenge has been attempted three times since 2010 , with all three attempts failing			0
three more attempts have been registered for this year			0
construction : @entity6 has been helped by a team of friends , including a veteran of @entity81 's @entity80 sailing : the boat will rely on wind for power but will be steered by a solar powered computer and a gps tracker the challenge : @entity8 will depart from @entity45 , then sail along the @entity46 before heading south towards the @entity47 and then off to the @entity48 , to eventually land in @entity49 , @entity50			1

@entity6 , 65 , hopes to sail his four foot long boat 6,000 miles to @entity62 shores
his craft will set off from @entity45 , @entity123 , on saturday as part of the @entity11
