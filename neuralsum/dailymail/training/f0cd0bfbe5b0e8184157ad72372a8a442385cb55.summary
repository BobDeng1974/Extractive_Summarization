the accusations were made by @entity6 co-chair @entity17 and came to light last week as part of a batch of hacked emails released by a group calling themselves the @entity24			1
the author in question is @entity27 , the poker hostess who was arrested after hosting games with @entity30 a-listers such as @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
the games , which initially took place in a back room at the infamous @entity38 bar on @entity39 in @entity40 , frequently saw huge amounts of money won and lost on games			2
after an @entity45 sting put pay to her $ 4m - a - year job she revealed all the a-list names in her book @entity49 - now being used by @entity0 for a screenplay			2
@entity0 , the creator of @entity51 and @entity52 used an op - ed for the @entity8 on monday to deny the relationship with the author is anything but professional			1
he wrote : ' the widely published documents that were stolen include an email to ms. @entity17 in which i advocated going to @entity62 for the lead role ( i did ) , a second email from one executive to another speculating that i ’m broke ( i ’m fine ) and a third that suggested that i might be romantically involved with a woman whose book i ’m using as source material for a new script ( i wish )			1
he added : ' i know there ’s juicy stuff in the emails and i know some of us have been insulted and i know there ’s more to come			2
no one ’s private life can totally withstand public scrutiny			0
but this is much bigger than hurt feelings and banged - up egos			0
' the op - ed piece went on to condemn the media for releasing the details hacked from the accounts of @entity6 executives and ' doing the bidding of the @entity24			1
' he referred to it as ' morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable			1
' the hacked emails from senior executives at @entity91 have so far played havoc with its computer network , revealed confidential information regarding its staff and a-list actors , exposed explosive internal squabbles among senior executives and their emails revealing their true feelings about certain @entity102 actors			2
@entity104 has been described as a ' spoiled brat with minimal talent ' while @entity31 has been called ' despicable ' , the emails have revealed			0
the most damaging hack so far came in the form of email ' banter ' between co-chair @entity17 and film producer @entity112 in which they speculated about the type of films liked by president @entity116 before reeling off a list of titles that had cast african - americans and dealt with issues such as slavery			1
@entity0 was accused of having a romantic relationship with high - level poker hostess @entity27			1
her book @entity49 reveals she arranged games for a number of @entity30 's well - known names the email exchange took place before ms. @entity17 attended a breakfast for mr. @entity116 that was organized by @entity131 , chief executive of @entity132			1
she wrote : ' what should i ask the president at this stupid @entity131 breakfast ? ” ms. @entity17 asked mr. @entity112 in an opening query			2
she then speculated that she might ask if mr. @entity116 liked “ @entity139 , ” about a former slave			0
mr. @entity112 countered with a suggestion about “ 12 years a slave , ” while ms. @entity17 suggested other films involving african - americans			2
finally , mr. @entity112 wrote : “ ride - along			0
i bet he likes @entity146			0
” the email referred to a broad comedy , from @entity149 , that starred mr. @entity146 and @entity150			0
it is still unclear who the @entity154 area and what their motive is for hacking @entity91 , although @entity158 is widely believed to be the culprit and retaliating against @entity6 's upcoming film , @entity161 , which involves a @entity163 plot to kill @entity164 , the country 's supreme leader			0
@entity0 , who has also penned the script to the long - planned @entity168 biopic , insisted in his op - ed that @entity6 had not done anything illegal and did not deserve this kind of breach			0
he wrote : ' i 'm not crazy about @entity143 calling other @entity143 un-american , so let ’s just say that every news outlet that did the bidding of the @entity24 is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable			1
' as the emails continued to be leaked , more information regarding a number of celebrities has eben uncovered			0
according to the @entity184 , @entity183 's father @entity182 emailed @entity6 executives in 2013 to suggest a biopic about @entity187			0
representatives of @entity189 also contacted staff about a possible feature film about the rapper while the idea of a female spiderman or an assistant was floated			0
his piece comes days after an email from @entity6 executive @entity17 ( left ) was leaked which stated that the creator of @entity51 was ' broke ' and having an affair - accusations which he has denied			1
