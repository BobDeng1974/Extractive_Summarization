two years ago , @entity7 left for work as usual but never made it - instead ending up in @entity10 after completely losing his memory due to a combination of stress and trauma			1
when his wife @entity16 eventually located him in a local hospital , she was told he had total memory loss			1
he did n't even know his own name , recognise himself or wife @entity16 after the incident new memories : today @entity7 re-proposed to his wife live on national tv as a thank you for her love and support when she later walked into the hospital room , he had no idea who she was - instead thinking she was a doctor			1
over the past two years , she has remained by his side , trying to teach him not only about his past , but also how to perform basic activities such as brushing his teeth and getting dressed			1
mr @entity7 , 35 , told @entity39 's @entity38 : ' i was driving to work one night in may 2012 when i was struck with a severe bout of stress			1
' hours later , i woke up in hospital			0
then a woman walked into the hospital bay and said " @entity7 "			2
' i thought she was a doctor and looked at her blankly			0
he told presenters @entity46 and @entity48 : ' i love her with all my heart ' , and then turned to @entity16 and said : ' will you re-marry me ? , to which she replied ' yes , i will			1
' true love : @entity7 said even when he did n't recognise @entity16 , he thought she looked nice ' she said " @entity7 - that is your name			1
i 'm @entity16 and i 'm your wife "			2
' i did n't know what a wife was			2
' she lifted up her wedding ring finger and clicked her ring into mine			0
we have jigsaw wedding rings and that made me realise we must be linked in some way			0
' ' i saw her and thought " she looks nice and friendly "			0
i was quite excited , but confused			0
@entity16 then explained the couple have two children - and fortunately , @entity7 had their names tattooed on his arm			1
recalling the fateful night , @entity16 told presenters @entity46 and @entity48 : ' his work called to say he had n't turned up and so i called the police			1
' i saw her and thought " she looks nice and friendly "			0
i was quite excited , but confused. , ' he recalled ' later that evening i got a call from the local hospital saying there was a chap there called @entity79			0
' my first question was " is he alive or dead " ? ' they said he was fit and well , but could n't remember anything			0
' she admitted that she had no idea how extreme his memory loss would be			1
' i had to fib to the children a bit , as you do			0
i told them that @entity90 had slipped on mud , hit his head and had lost a bit of memory			2
' @entity7 's memory loss was so bad that he did n't even recognise himself in the mirror			1
' i was scared , as i am a big chap , ' he said she then began the painstaking - and often heartbreaking - process of teaching her husband who he was , his past , and how to live			0
@entity7 's memory loss was so bad that he did n't even recognise himself in the mirror			1
' i was scared , as i am a big chap [ and wondered who it was ] , ' he explained to @entity46 and @entity48			0
@entity16 said his personalty was also much more formal			2
' he was very innocent and wide - eyed and would call me @entity105 , rather than a nickname , ' she recalls			0
two years on , he is still unable to remember huge swathes of his past			2
@entity7 says there have been flickers of his childhood that have returned - and he has had dozens of old friends contact him on social media to help try and plug the gap			2
but there have been other times when his memory loss has devastated him			1
he told the programme : ' there were some pictures of me holding the children after they were born and i could n't remember any of it			2
i just sat there and burst out crying			0
' but @entity16 says she now focuses on creating new memories , rather than trying to re-invoke old ones with bags of old photos			0
and this morning , he paved the way to making more new memories by asking his wife to 're - marry ' him			0
he told @entity46 and @entity48 : ' i love her with all my heart ' , and then turned to @entity16 and said : ' will you re-marry me ? , to which she replied ' yes , i will			1
