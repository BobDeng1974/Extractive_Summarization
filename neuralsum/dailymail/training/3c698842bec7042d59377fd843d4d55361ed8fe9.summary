the country has launched a battle against the @entity15 internet giant			1
' today , everyone has had enough of @entity3 , which , by dumping , slashes prices to get a foothold in markets only to raise them once they have established a virtual monopoly , ' culture minister @entity16 said reported @entity25			2
' it is destructive for bookshops , ' the minister told a conference of booksellers monday in the southwestern city of @entity32			1
ms @entity16 said that she would be examining measures that could curb @entity3 's growth			0
one of them could be restricting the @entity15 giant 's ability to combine offers of free deliveries with discounts on cover prices			1
the maximum discount allowed in @entity2 under existing legislation is five per cent - this is is designed to protect small booksellers			0
@entity3 is already firmly on @entity2 's radar - last year it received a £ 159million demand from @entity2 for unpaid taxes			0
the figure includes fines and interest in relation to ' the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions '			0
damaging : ' it is destructive for bookshops , ' the minister told a conference of booksellers in the southwestern city of @entity32 @entity3 has also run into problems with the tax authorities in other countries , with @entity15 and @entity63 officials both forcing the company to ‘ reach an agreement ’ on the allocation of the company ’s earnings between 2006 and 2012			1
the company has also revealed that it is under investigation by the @entity15 @entity72 over its tax returns for the two years from 2005			2
the company is also facing demands for taxes dating back to 2003 from countries including @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 , as well as @entity81			0
gaining ground : @entity3 has been delivering groceries in their hometown of @entity85 for five years but now they are rolling out those services in more cities , immediately including @entity88 and soon @entity89 there are also fears in @entity15 that @entity3 is going to destroy another local type of store - supermarkets			2
@entity3 is planning a major roll - out of an online grocery business that it has been quietly developing for years			0
the online retailer has been delivering food to locals in @entity85 , @entity100 - where the internet giant 's headquarters are based - but they announced on tuesday that they plan to expand the operation to include many more @entity15 markets			1
it will clearly be a cause for concern in the food industry as brick - and - mortar grocery stores will see their markets threatened by the familiar online store .			0
