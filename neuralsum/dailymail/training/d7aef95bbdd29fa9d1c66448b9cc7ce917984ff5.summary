viewers were ' outraged ' with the new format which saw the judges forced to whittle down 100 contestants in all their categories to just 24			1
this year , for the first time in the show 's history , the singers had to battle it out on stage in a ‘ musical chairs ’ style section which saw performers face the threat of being ousted by a better singer or group			1

' but singer @entity102 blasted : ' when did become alright to f * * * with peoples minds			1
x factor has got fully mean			0
' despite viewers ' anger the @entity106 show still managed to attract an average audience of 9.5 million viewers , with a peak of 10.9 million on sunday evening			1
cruel process : popular @entity113 had taken her seat on one of the six chairs , but was harshly replaced by @entity118 when @entity119 decided to take her through instead judges were forced to decide straight after the contestant 's performance whether to take them through or not			1
those who got a yes , took a seat in the final six chairs on the stage			1
but if the judges wanted to send another act through once their six spots were full they had to option of ditching one of the hopefuls who had already been given a ' yes '			1
@entity113 , from @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 all lost their seats after @entity119 had already put them through			1
@entity119 was torn as to whether to take @entity134 through she said : ' @entity134 you are the only person that has made me cry today so i ’m going to go with my heart			2
' deflated : @entity142 sung his heart out on the show , winning a seat , but he was replaced by @entity146 after his stirring rendition @entity147 by @entity148 heartbreak : @entity149 is inconsolable after being sent home by @entity119 however just a few minutes later , after @entity151 performed , @entity119 loved @entity151 ’s vocal so much that she instantaneously decided to eliminate @entity134 and replace her with @entity152 for judges houses			1
last night there was even more disappointment when @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 were also eliminated			0
when @entity161 remarked that he would drop singer @entity162 from the line - up , dad - of - one @entity160 burst into tears and while pacing the stage weeping and pleading ' not again ' – as he was previously ditched from the show during last year ’s @entity168 stage			1
but judges @entity170 , @entity119 , @entity171 and @entity172 did manage to cut down their contestants from 100 to just 24 as a result of the process			1
these final six in each category will now go through to the ' @entity179 ' stage of the competition			2
you 're gone : the tough process saw people get up and leave their seats , despite thinking they were already safely through to the judges houses xxx returning hopefuls @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity149 had the biggest opportunity to impress the judges with a rendition of @entity192 hit @entity193 during a sing off to determine which of them should sing alone			1
however , the performance had @entity119 , @entity161 , @entity172 and @entity196 divided over @entity149 - whose vocals were out - shined			2
' i just do n't know , i feel like the other voices were stronger , ' said @entity119 after asking the girls to wait backstage			0
' you would n't want to give her another chance ? ' pleaded @entity172 , who previously admitted to having a soft spot for the 20 - year - old after taking her to judges houses six - years ago			1
however , a determined @entity119 resolved to give her the red card			0
good news : the former @entity208 kicks her slippered feet in delight after being told who she will mentor @entity135 was next up , and she impressed with a rousing version of fun			0

' i like you and i like your voice , but is @entity119 gon na pick you ? i do n't know , ' said @entity196			0
' you have a beautiful , rich tone to your voice but i do n't know if i would 've picked that song for you , but @entity135 ...			0

tough decision : the judges must chose between returning hopefuls @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity149 tough choice : @entity119 watches the three girls perform on saturday night 's show uncomfortable viewing : the process which saw singers perform in front of their fellow competitors before potentially being booted off the show was uncomfortable for many people to watch you 're staying : @entity238 impresses with a rendition of @entity241 's stay but despite filling up all her six seats being taken , there were three performances to go - meaning @entity119 could take advantage of the new twist and swap one girl for another			1
first up was @entity151 , who made an impassioned plea after taking to the stage : ' everything i 've been through , i tell you i 'm not going back there ! ' she cried			1
@entity258 words : @entity119 loses it backstage after a string of mediocre performances her performance of @entity263 hit i 'd @entity264 had @entity119 raising her hands in delight - and posed a serious conundrum for the former @entity208			2
next up was 18 - year - old supermarket worker @entity118 , whose nerves almost got the better of her before she performed			2
' it 's interesting because that 's not the song i would have chosen for you			0
ultimately it 's my decision			0
@entity118 , i want you in my top six			0
' obviously that means somebody has to lose their seat ...			0
okay , the person who 's going to lose their seat in my top six is ... @entity113			0
' next up : @entity283 takes to the stage with a performance of @entity287 's @entity286 here we go : @entity118 performs during saturday 's show you 've made it : @entity118 is told she 's made the final six things got off to a promising start with prison officer @entity294 impressing the judges with a version of @entity298 's clown that had the fiery judge up on her feet			1
' that was absolutely note perfect , ' said @entity161			0
' i just want you to know that of all the years i 've been involved and not involved in this show i 've dreamed of a contestant like you , ' added a tearful @entity172			2
' i 've come to a decision ... yes , put your bum on that seat			0
' hopeful : @entity311 takes to the stage for a performance of @entity314 by @entity315 hugs : @entity311 is embraced after making the final six after a moment of comedy from good natured @entity320 , who performed @entity322 's @entity323 before being given her marching orders , it was call center worker @entity326 's chance to shine - and shine he did , with a moving version of @entity328 classic @entity329			1
' that 's called taking a risk , and it paid off , ' said @entity161			0
however , @entity172 was n't convinced			0
' my darling you should be very proud of your self because that was a really solid performance , ' she said			0
' however , i 'm not sure and my decision is ... i 'm going to send you home			0
' emotional : @entity134 impresses after taking to the stage , but her time in the top six would be short lived emotional : @entity119 was close to tears following @entity134 's performance popular choice : returning singer @entity320 impressed with a version of @entity347 hit @entity348 @entity349 , 28 , took the next seat with a performance of i 'd rather go blind			1
' it was a flawless performance and my decision is ... ' said @entity172 , pointing to one of the empty chairs			2
two down and proud dad of one @entity162 came next , a year after he failed to impress the judges during boot camp			2
after a performance of @entity362 by the @entity363 , @entity172 told the emotional builder : ' i know this means a lot to you			0
i need people who are gon na be strong - i don '' t need wimps			2
' my decision is that you are going to have to go and join the ladies on the seat			0

100 contestants battled it out for just 24 places in a new ' musical chairs ' style twist
judges *awarded* one of their six seats to certain contestants , only to replace them later in the show by a better singer
contestants were also made to sing on stage whilst their competitors sat and watched on the *sidelines*
viewers have *dubbed* the new format cruel and likened it to the brutal battle - to - the - death @entity43 books
@entity4 drew an average audience of 9.5 million viewers on sunday evening
