@entity0 wanted @entity1 when he left @entity2 two years ago but he chose @entity3 over @entity4			1
it was a tough decision coming after his admission that the coach he had worked with on the @entity9 was like a footballing father to him			0
judging from comments made after @entity3 ’s midweek win over @entity14 , he still harbours some regrets over that decision to not follow the manager who really gave him his big chance			1
@entity4 allowed him to star in the @entity20 campaign that took @entity2 all the way to the quarter - finals , where they felt only refereeing incompetence prevented them reaching the semis			1
‘ i am not very content , i thought i was playing well , ’ was his message to @entity29 television on wednesday night after the win over @entity14			2
it was strange sentiment to convey with so much positivity around the club after their safe passage to the semi-finals			0
@entity29 midfielder @entity1 is unhappy with his current role and playing time at @entity3 @entity1 rarely starts for @entity3 when all of @entity42 's main options are fit he later tweeted : ' if we all stick together we will go further			1
' the show of solidarity was an attempt to gloss over the gut reaction after the match that revealed his sense of injustice at always being the player who sits out when everyone else is fit			0
@entity42 ’s first choice front three is @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 and his preferred midfield is @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
@entity1 is the seventh man in that front six			2
and if @entity42 persists with @entity63 in midfield in @entity60 ’s absence , @entity1 could even sit back on the bench when @entity55 returns			2
if @entity4 stays at @entity0 and @entity1 remains unhappy about how he only fits in at @entity3 when there are injuries , the @entity67 could appear on his horizon again			1
@entity1 joined @entity3 from another @entity72 side @entity2 in the summer of 2013 the 23 - year - old had a choice of @entity3 or @entity0 , and chose the @entity29 giants it would be too much to ask him to fill @entity78 ’s boots			1
@entity78 's great strength is the way that huge stride of his takes him up and down the pitch so quickly			0
@entity1 is more @entity83 than juggernaut and he tends to scurry more than maraud			2
he would have to play as @entity0 's @entity85 , he would n't be able to drop back into the middle two as @entity78 can			0
but at just 23 years of age , he also happens to be the player @entity88 intends to build his new @entity90 team around			0
he ’s also the player the @entity3 supporters adore perhaps more than any other , and he would be on the same wavelength as @entity93 , who needs a like - minded player in a @entity0 team that has put brawn over brains with recent midfield signings			1
@entity1 is one of @entity90 's new generation and @entity88 is looking to build the team around him @entity0 manager @entity4 worked with @entity1 during their time at @entity2 @entity1 could still play a big part in what is left of @entity3 ’s season but with the @entity106 on the horizon at the end of next season he will not want to have spent the previous campaign on the bench watching @entity55 , @entity57 , @entity56 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and whoever else @entity112 signs this summer			1
it would be interesting to see his response if he was asked for the second time in his career – do you want to come to @entity0 ?			0
