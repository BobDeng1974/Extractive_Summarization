painted by the greatest ever artist , it is the world ’s most famous picture , with the most famous smile			2
the painting has been imitated a thousand times , satirised , stolen and vandalised with acid , red paint , stones and even a teacup			1
and now , it seems , there might be a second @entity12 — a bigger @entity12 , with a less enigmatic , slightly jollier smile , and a pair of new classical columns on either side of her mysterious , beguiling face			2
on friday in @entity20 , the @entity19 is to be revealed by its owners — a @entity23 consortium , who argue that their version is @entity27 ’s first stab at the painting ; and that the famous version , held in the @entity30 in @entity31 , was his second bite of the cherry			1
@entity34 , the chess grandmaster and member of the @entity36 , will unveil the painting			2
in comparison : the real @entity12 , @entity27 's enigmatic masterpiece , is seen ( left ) ; while the @entity19 , a younger likeness between two pillars , is also shown ( right ) opinion within the art world is split over whether it is a real @entity27 or a later copy , painted in the late 16th century , long after the original was executed , between 1503 and 1519			1
among those backing the theory that it is genuine are @entity49 , director of the @entity50 in @entity27 , the artist ’s birthplace on the edge of @entity54			1
on friday , he will present the reasons for his conclusion , alongside @entity57 , of the @entity58			2
a spokesman for the @entity60 has promised that , on friday , the foundation will produce ‘ historical , comparative and scientific evidence ’ that the painting ‘ was indeed executed by @entity27 ’			1
not everyone is so convinced			2
‘ i would have to be deeply sceptical , ’ says @entity65 , the portrait expert , @entity68 presenter and host of @entity70 ? ‘ it would be an extraordinary find , the ultimate prize			0
@entity27 did do variants [ different versions of the same picture ] , like his @entity77 in last year ’s @entity79 show			1
so it would n’t be unheard of for him to do another @entity12			0
‘ still , you must remember that about one new supposed @entity12 turns up on the market every year			0
you ’d have to look at the provenance and history of this one very , very carefully			0
’ the known history of this second @entity12 goes back to 1914 , when it was bought by a critic and artist called @entity89 , from @entity90 , @entity91 — hence the name			0
world famous : the painting by @entity27 , pictured , has been imitated a thousand times , satirised , stolen and vandalised with acid , red paint , stones and even a teacup @entity89 bought the picture from a grand collection in @entity102 , where it had apparently hung on the walls for a century			1
in 1962 , an @entity106 art collector , @entity105 , bought the painting and devoted much of his life to proving it was an original			2
he even wrote a book backing his claim , where is the @entity12 ? , published by the @entity112 , his own company			0
' i would have to be deeply sceptical			0
it would be an extraordinary find , the ultimate prize ' @entity65 , portrait expert @entity117 — and other defenders of the @entity19 — depend for their attribution on @entity27 ’s 16th - century biographer , @entity120 , himself a painter			1
@entity120 said that @entity27 started the @entity12 in 1503 and ‘ left it unfinished ’			1
but then , in 1517 , said @entity120 , a completed picture of a ‘ certain @entity54 lady ’ popped up in @entity27 ’s collection			1
this picture is the @entity30 version , while the unfinished earlier version was the @entity129 , or so the theory goes			2
that order of events would explain why the @entity19 looks younger than the famous version — because it was , theoretically , painted years before the famous version			1
@entity117 also depended for his theory on @entity137 , the painter and contemporary of @entity27 , who sketched a version of the @entity12 in 1504			1
his sketch included the columns that are found in the @entity90 version			2
the final big piece in the jigsaw , said @entity105 , was a 1584 art history book , @entity147 dell’arte della @entity146 ed @entity148 , by @entity149 , which refers to ‘ della @entity151 , e di @entity12 ’ — ‘ the @entity151 , and the @entity12 ’ — suggesting there were two pictures			0
admiration : art fans look at the @entity12 painting by @entity27 , left , in the @entity30 museum in @entity31 the @entity151 is an alternative title for the @entity12 ; @entity12 is an abbreviation of ‘ @entity160 ’ , or my lady , while @entity151 is @entity163 for the jocund , or happy , one			1
the sitter ’s real name is in fact thought to be @entity168 , wife of a rich @entity54 silk merchant , @entity168			2
on @entity27 ’s death in 1519 , the picture — the @entity30 ’s version , that is ! — was left to his assistant , @entity173 , who in turn sold it to @entity176 of @entity177			1
the painting remained in the royal collection until the @entity180 in 1789 , when it was moved to the @entity30			2
there it has remained ever since , with a few notable absences			0
@entity185 kept it in his bedroom in the @entity188 and , during the @entity189 of 1870 - 1 , it was transferred for safekeeping to the @entity190 in @entity191			0
during @entity193 , it migrated all over @entity177 to avoid damage			0
it has also been on tour to @entity197 and @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
but the picture ’s biggest excursion was in 1911 , when it was stolen by an @entity163 @entity30 worker , called @entity205 , who wanted it returned to @entity163			0
he pulled off the biggest art theft in history in the simplest way : hiding in a broom cupboard during the day , then slipping out after closing time , the @entity12 stuffed under his coat			0
he kept it in his flat for two years and was only discovered when he brazenly tried to flog the picture to the @entity215 in @entity54			0
@entity217 skill : @entity27 's exceptional @entity218 was painted in around 1490 , nearly 15 years before the @entity30 's @entity12 ; and already it displays @entity27 's supreme talent that was n’t the end of @entity12 ’s troubles			1
in 1956 , the poor old girl was first scarred with acid , and then attacked with a rock			0
bulletproof glass protected it when , in 1974 , a disabled woman , protesting against the @entity30 ’s policy on handicapped visitors , threw red paint at the picture			0
the glass again saved the picture only three years ago , when an angry @entity236 woman , denied @entity177 citizenship , threw a teacup at the painting			2
meanwhile , the other supposed @entity12 gathered dust in a @entity23 bank vault , where it has rested for 40 years			1
after @entity105 ’s death , he left the picture to his girlfriend and , on her death , the @entity23 consortium bought it			1
' she might look younger , but this is probably because the copyist — and i believe it is a copy done a few years after the @entity12 — just painted it that way ' @entity254 , @entity255 this friday , the art world will examine it in the flesh for the first time since @entity117 briefly exhibited it in an @entity106 show half - a - century ago			1
many art historians remain doubtful			0
‘ so much is wrong , ’ says the @entity27 expert and emeritus professor of art at @entity255 , @entity254			1
‘ the dress , the hair and background landscape			0
this one is also painted on canvas , which @entity27 rarely did			1
’ the famous @entity12 is painted on wood , as are practically all of his paintings			0
‘ she might look younger , ’ says professor @entity254 , ‘ but this is probably because the copyist — and i believe it is a copy done a few years after the @entity12 — just painted it that way			2
’ the theory used to go that , because the @entity90 picture was done earlier in @entity27 ’s career , he had not matured in style when he painted it			1
that theory was blown out of the water last year at the @entity79 exhibition , when his exceptional @entity218 was shown			0
that picture was painted in around 1490 , nearly 15 years before the @entity30 ’s @entity12 ; and already it displays @entity27 ’s supreme talent			1
‘ that show confirmed his extraordinary skill in the way he expressed skin and modelling , ’ says @entity65			0
‘ you ’d have to have a dispassionate look at the technique in the @entity90 picture , and do lots of forensics			0
but still , nothing is impossible			0
’ and so the art world will wait with bated breath until thursday , when the door of that @entity23 bank vault creaks open , to see if lightning really did strike twice for the world ’s greatest artist .			1
