suspected @entity2 @entity1 fighters have abducted dozens of boys and men from a village in northeast @entity6 , according to witnesses			1
after loading them onto trucks and driving them off more 97 people are now missing			1
the kidnappings come four months after @entity1 , which is fighting to reinstate a medieval @entity14 caliphate in religiously mixed @entity6 , abducted more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of @entity17			1
several witnesses who fled after sunday 's raid on @entity21 , a sandy fishing village near the shores of @entity24 , said militants clothed in military and police uniforms had burned several houses			1
' they left no men or boys in the place ; only young children , girls and women , ' said @entity34 , sobbing softly and looking exhausted after a 180 km ( 110 mile ) road trip on the back of a truck to @entity38 , capital of the northeastern state of @entity40			2
suspected @entity2 @entity1 fighters have abducted dozens of boys and men from a village in northeast @entity6 , according to witnesses			1
the kidnappings come four months after @entity1 abducted more than 200 schoolgirls ( pictured ) fom the village of @entity17 ' they were shouting ' @entity45 ' ( @entity46 is greatest ) , shooting sporadically			1
' they started parking our men and boys into their vehicles , threatening to shoot whoever disobey them			2
' they said six older men were also killed in sunday 's raid , while another five people were wounded			1
@entity1 , seen as the number one security threat to @entity63 's top economy and oil producer , has dramatically increased attacks on civilians in the past year , and the once - grassroots movement has rapidly lost popular support as it gets more bloodthirsty			1
its solution - kidnapping boys and forcing them to fight and abducting girls as sex slaves - is a chilling echo of @entity76 rebel @entity74 's @entity73 , which has operated in the same way in @entity76 , @entity78 and @entity63 for decades			2
@entity1 leader @entity79 in a video he sent taunting the @entity6 government over the kidnapping of the girls from their boarding school dormitory in april the military did not respond to a request for comment			2
a security source said they were aware of the incident but were still investigating the details			0
the kidnappers overpowered local vigilantes who had no support because this is no military presence there , the villagers said			0
@entity99 , another villager who fled to @entity38 , said the invaders had taunted the men for being unable to defend themselves			0
' they were shouting ' where is your pride ? you people used to be warriors			0
today you are all just women , not as brave as we thought ' , ' he said			0
he said that from his @entity112 clan alone , some 47 people were missing and feared to have been abducted			1
the raid shows how mobile @entity1 units can be			2
after a military offensive in may last year broke their hold on the area around @entity24 in the far northeast of @entity40 , the rebels relocated to the south of the state , near the @entity123 border nearly 300 km ( 190 miles ) away			0
@entity17 , where the girls were taken from , is in this area			0
their re-appearance in the area demonstrates their ability to move across vast swathes of northeastern @entity6 without being intercepted by the military			0
@entity6 forces are overstretched against a determined foe			0
in the past week they have fought gun battles with @entity135 in two key towns in the south of @entity138 , the security sources said , and the garrison town of @entity141 , which the militants sacked a month ago .			0
