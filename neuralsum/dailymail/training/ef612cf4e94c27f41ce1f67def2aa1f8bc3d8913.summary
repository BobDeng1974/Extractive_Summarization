a trippy new yoga class is encouraging students to smoke marijuana before starting their practice			1
@entity4 , 34 , began teaching weekly @entity6 group classes at @entity7 's @entity9 studio in october			1
each class is 75 minutes long and costs $ 15			1
' a lot of students are consuming it before yoga anyway , ' she told @entity16			2
' so a big benefit that i am hearing is the community aspect			0
the first thing they want to do after consuming cannabis is lay down and stretch			2
and , depending upon the dosage and strain , it really encourages people to relax			0
' pot yoga : at @entity31 's @entity30 class in @entity7 ( not pictured in this stock photo ) students are encouraged to smoke marijuana before the begin their poses students are asked to smoke cannabis on their own prior to arrival - but those with a medical marijuana card can get high with their fellow yogis during a 15 - minute pre-class session at which attendees introduce themselves while sitting in a circle			1
ms @entity4 , who has practiced yoga for 20 years and previously taught the ganja variety in @entity45 starting in 2009 , says that the idea of pairing pot with yoga has ancient roots			1
' historically , cannabis has been linked to really early use with yoga in ancient @entity54 cults			2
back then , they were n't smoking it , but drinking it in a milk beverage and burning it as an incense , ' she said			0
her class , which is usually attended by 16 students on wednesday evenings , has proved so popular that she 's looking into adding additional times			1
' i get as many people who are hard - core yoga practitioners but new to cannabis as i do cannabis consumers who are new to yoga , ' she told @entity70			2
' i also get a number of people who regularly use both , but not necessarily together			0
and some are regular practitioners of cannabis - enhanced yoga and are glad to have a place to go			2
so , it 's a variety of previous experience levels and motivations			2
' high times : students are asked to smoke cannabis on their own prior to arrival - but those with a medical marijuana card can get stoned with their fellow yogis during a 15 - minute pre-class session ( stock photo ) while the class attracts equal numbers of male and female practitioners , ms @entity4 notes that ' far more men ' attend @entity6 than her other yoga classes			1
however , experts warn that it might be dangerous to engage in athletic activity while high on a controlled substance - according to the @entity99 , marijuana raises your heart rate by 20 - 100per cent and the effect can last up to three hours			0
but ms @entity4 insists that her moves are slow and gentle			1
' we do not do any postures that are not suited to altered states of conscious - it 's very sweet and very , very safe , ' she writes on her website , adding that singles , couples and groups of friends frequently book her for private sessions			0
ms @entity4 also offers private instruction in @entity116 and @entity117			1
' cannabis , if the strain and dose are correct for the individual , promotes relaxation			0
so , the two together are greater than the sum of the parts , ' she said			0
' cannabis can help to decrease brain activity that is required for production and consumption - which of course we are conditioned to constantly be doing			0
it takes people to a place in which they are more open to relaxing tensions in the body and mind			0
it makes them want to chill out , have a good time , enjoy life			0
' ms @entity4 is n't the first to bring pot yoga to the @entity145 ; yogi @entity146 has been teaching 4:20 yoga at @entity149 studio @entity148 since 2010 .			1

students at @entity4 's weekly @entity152 in @entity7 smoke cannabis before class
