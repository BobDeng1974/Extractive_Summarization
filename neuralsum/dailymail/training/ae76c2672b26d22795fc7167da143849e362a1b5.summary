six senior figures in the @entity2 @entity1 have pledged allegiance to the @entity4 and its leader @entity5 in a symbol of the terrorists ' expanding influence among @entity10 groups			1
withdrawing their loyalty to the @entity13 @entity1 's leader @entity12 , the men - made up of the group 's chief spokesman @entity15 and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the @entity2 @entity1 , but added they now consider themselves affiliates of @entity22			1
the move is likely to have serious consequences for security in @entity2 , particularly near the @entity13 border where all six of the men are based , leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression @entity22 has employed in the vast swathes of @entity33 and @entity34 under the group 's control			1
however rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the @entity2 @entity1 were set to declare their loyalty to @entity59			2
' i show allegiance to the commander of faithful , @entity64 @entity62 , and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be , ' @entity15 said in the recording			0
there is now concern that other senior figures in the @entity2 @entity1 may defect to @entity22 , including the group 's overall leader @entity75 , who has previously voiced support for the terror group			1
despite several members having declared their @entity22 sympathies , yesterday 's announcement is the first time any senior figure within the @entity2 @entity1 has actually sworn allegiance to @entity59			1
it also points to the @entity2 @entity1 's growing detachment from @entity88 's central command in @entity13 , as greater numbers of @entity91 extremists abandon links with @entity93 to flock to the so - called ' caliphate ' established by @entity59 in northern @entity33 and western @entity34			1
armed : the @entity2 @entity1 ( pictured ) has grown increasingly factious in recent months , as members seek to distance themselves from the group 's central command in @entity13 the move points to the growing detachment from the @entity1 's central command in @entity13 , where @entity88 ( pictured ) leads the group the @entity4 was previously - like the @entity1 - an affiliate of @entity93 , but terror leader @entity103 admonished @entity59 's group as too extreme and expelled the group late last year			1
since then @entity22 has gained vast swathes of territory in the @entity107 , welcomed thousands of fanatics from around the world into its ranks , and become the richest terror group in history , thanks to donations from wealthy @entity116 sympathisers and an income of up to Â£ 2million a day from oil fields			2
@entity2 @entity1 spokesman @entity15 has not been available for comment since the @entity22 allegiance recording emerged yesterday , but the @entity121 has spoke anonymously with one of his close aides			1
' these commanders will remain with the organization , but will also represent @entity22 in @entity2 , he said			2
' the decision came after differences developed with the @entity13 @entity1			2
i ca n't say now what are the differences , but these commanders have changed their loyalties from @entity88 to @entity22 chief @entity5 , ' he added			0
terrorist : rumours have been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the @entity2 @entity1 were set to declare their loyalty to @entity5 's militant group @entity22 ( pictured ) rumours that senior members of the @entity2 @entity1 were likely to pledge allegiance to @entity22 have circulated for weeks , and intensified last week when the group 's leader @entity75 voiced his support for the terrorists			1
however the @entity2 @entity1 's later issued a clarification of his words , insisting that for now the group were not abandoning historical ties with @entity88 's @entity13 branch			1
following yesterday 's announcement - where the group 's official spokesperson and regional leaders in tribal areas close to the @entity13 border , including @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 - pledged loyalty to @entity59 , those links now appear weaker than ever			2
there have been signs that @entity22 could gain a foothold in @entity2 for quite some time , despite the country already being home to more than two dozen terrorist groups			0
last month , a 12 - page pamphlet was distributed in @entity159 , inviting people to join the group			0
@entity171 police have detained another 13 @entity91 men suspected to be linked to the @entity4			0
head of the national police counter-terrorism unit @entity175 says the men were detained yesterday in central @entity178 state			0
he says further details will be released later today			0
police last month picked up three @entity91 men at the airport on suspicion of heading to @entity33 to join the @entity4			0
earlier this year , authorities detained 19 suspected militants for allegedly planning to carry out terrorist acts in the country and abroad			0
seven have been charged so far and the rest released			0
prime minister @entity188 has said the arrests show the government is serious in routing out militants .			0
