it sounds like the perfect health food , it 's free , and there is literally thousands of tonnes of it			2
but would you tuck into a sloppy bowel of fluorescent green algae soup , verdant algae pancakes , or a bar snack of fried algae and nuts ? abundance : the seas off @entity22 's @entity21 , may look infested to some , but to one clever chef , it 's a vision of free food it might not be our cup of tea , but in @entity21 , in @entity22 's eastern @entity32 province , where the beach has been swamped with one of the largest recorded annual blooms of the stuff , it simply makes sense to eat it			1
the algae growth this year has covered a 29,000sq km area and is blamed for starving marine life of oxygen			1
the scale of the spread has been blamed on warm seas , but many scientists point the finger at pollution for the phenomenon			0
some experts say that the algae blooms in water with high levels of nutrients , blaming farmers using too much fertiliser on their crops and cities falling to treat sewage properly			2
health benefits : residents have n't been deterred from bathing and playing in the weed ; now they can eat it too this year the non-toxic algae bloom is worse than the 2008 growth which had to be cleaned up before the @entity65 it appears some local residents are also collecting the green sludge , perhaps to try cooking it themselves it is twice as vast as the giant green bloom that was cleaned up before @entity22 hosted the @entity72			1
while it has n't deterred residents from taking a dip in the green syrupy waters , believing it to be good for them , officials are eager to get the weed cleaned up before it begins to rot			0
this form of algae , a non poisonous sea lettuce known as @entity84 , can produce large quantities of hydrogen sulphide , a toxic gas , when it decomposes			0
but while it is fresh , chef @entity88 , who manages @entity89 ( @entity91 ) restaurant in @entity21 , is seeing the green infestation as an opportunity			1
he told @entity95 : ' we felt that the algae was so green that it probably did n't have any bacteria in it , so we gathered some up and experimented with a few recipes			0
' local residents have heard about his offerings and have been showing up in droves to give it a try			0
on the menu is algae and duck soup , with eggs to offset the bitter taste , steamed green algae pancakes , which have proven to be a winner at lunch , and a cold dish of algae and nuts - a steal at just Â£ 1 a plate			1
' it tastes a bit like kelp and we find that our customers are very curious to know what all our algae tastes like			1
they hear about our recipes and then feel like they have to come here and try it personally , ' he said			0
with such curious appeal , it appears other restaurants are now also taking note and looking at ways to make a return on this free ingredient			0
perhaps it could become an annual delicacy in this part of eastern @entity22 .			2

non-toxic algae has covered a 29,000sq km of @entity21 's beach in @entity22
one chef is serving it up in soup , pancakes and as a cold bar snack
curious customers flock to try out the *unusual* verdant offering
