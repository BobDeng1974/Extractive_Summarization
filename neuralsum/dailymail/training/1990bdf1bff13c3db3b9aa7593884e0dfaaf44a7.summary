by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:54 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:00 est , 27 december 2013 hunter - gatherers search for food in the same way as animals including sharks and honeybees , according to anthropologists			2
the @entity11 tribe – one of the last big game hunters in africa - hunt for food in a way that is described by a mathematical pattern called a @entity19 walk			1
the pattern is found in the movements of lots of animals but it is the first time that it has been found to match the way that humans forage			1
the @entity11 tribe ¿ one of the last big game hunters in africa - hunt for food in a way that is described by a mathematical pattern called a @entity19 walk			1
here , a @entity11 hunter wearing a baboon skin returns to camp with a haunch of impala over his shoulder the @entity19 walk pattern appears to be ubiquitous in animals , similar to the golden ratio , phi , which is a mathematical ratio that has been found to describe proportions in plants and animals throughout nature			1
now a study led by @entity46 anthropologist @entity45 has found it can be applied to the @entity11 tribe in @entity47			1
‘ scientists have been interested in characterising how animals search for a long time , so we decided to look at whether human hunter - gatherers use similar patterns , ' said professor @entity45			0
the @entity11 tribe is one of the last groups on @entity56 to still forage on foot with traditional methods and professor @entity59 said : ‘ if you want to understand human hunter - gatherer movement , you have to work with a group like the @entity11 ’			1
for the experiment , members of the tribe wore wristwatches with gps units that tracked their movement while on hunting trips			0
the @entity19 walk pattern appears to be ubiquitous in animals , including sharks and is similar to the golden ratio , phi , as it is a mathematical ratio that has been found to describe proportions in plants and animals throughout nature the @entity19 walk involves a series of short movements in one area and then a longer trek to another area			1
the definition stems from mathematics related to chaos theory and is useful in simulations for random or pseudo-random natural phenomena			0
examples include earthquake data analysis , financial mathematics and well applications in astronomy , biology , and physics			0
when sharks and other ocean predators ca n’t find food , the opt for a mixture of long trajectories and short , random movements - a @entity19 walk			1
researchers have previously analysed over 12 million movements recorded over 5,700 days in 55 radio - tagged animals from 14 ocean predator species in the @entity106 and @entity105 , including silky sharks , yellow fin tuna , blue marlin and swordfish			2
the data showed that @entity19 flights interspersed with @entity113 ( the random motion seen in swirling gas molecules ) can describe the animals ' hunting patterns			2
birds and other animals also seem to follow @entity19 flights when searching for food			2
the gps data showed that while the @entity124 use other movement patterns , the dominant theme of their foraging movements is a @entity19 walk – the same pattern used by many other animals when hunting or foraging			1
the @entity19 walk involves a series of short movements in one area and then a longer trek to another area			1
@entity134 , an anthropologist at @entity135 who has worked with the @entity11 people since 2004 and co-author of the study , said : ‘ detecting this pattern among the @entity11 , as has been found in several other species , tells us that such patterns are likely the result of general foraging strategies that many species adopt , across a wide variety of contexts			2
’ describing human movement patterns could help anthropologists understand how humans transported raw materials in the past			0
professor @entity45 said : ‘ we can characterise these movement patterns across different human environments and that means we can use this movement pattern to understand past mobility			0
’ @entity160 , another co-author of the study and a physical anthropologist at the @entity163 , @entity159 , explained that the mathematical pattern seems to occur across species and environments from the desert to cities			0
‘ it shows up all across the world in different species and links the way that we move around in the natural world			0
this suggests that it ’s a fundamental pattern likely present in our evolutionary history ’ he said			0
the @entity11 tribe is one of the last groups on @entity56 to still forage on foot with traditional methods and professor @entity59 said : ' if you want to understand human hunter - gatherer movement , you have to work with a group like the @entity11 '			1
here , a youth sits on a @entity186 skin and plays a musical instrument the @entity19 walk is not limited to searching for food			1
studies have shown that humans sometimes follow a @entity19 walk while ambling around an amusement park and it can be used for planning cities			2
professor @entity45 said that most people observe the @entity19 walk pattern on a daily basis			2
‘ what do you do on a normal day ? go to work and come back , walk short distances around your house ? then every once in a while you take these long steps , on foot , bike , in a car or on a plane			0
we tend to take short steps in one area and then take longer strides to get to another area , ’ he said			0
the researchers hope to conduct further research to understand the reasons for using a @entity19 walk and whether the pattern is determined by the distribution of resources in the environment			1
@entity220 , a member of the research team and an anthropologist at @entity223 in @entity224 , said : ‘ we ’re very interested in studying why the @entity11 use this pattern , what ’s driving their hunting strategies and when they use this pattern versus another pattern			0
’ professor @entity134 said : ‘ we 'd really like to know how and why specific environmental conditions or individual traits influence movement patterns			0
' the study was published in in the @entity234 .			0

researchers led by the @entity46 used a pattern called a @entity19 walk to describe the way humans forage for food for the first time
the @entity19 walk involves a series of short movements in one area and then a longer trek to another area
the pattern is *frequently* used to explain the movement of animals but has now been applied to the @entity11 tribe in @entity47
