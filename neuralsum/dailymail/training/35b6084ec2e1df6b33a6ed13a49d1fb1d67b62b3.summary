@entity1 spies today admitted they can access mobile phone and email records without a warrant - if they are handed over by @entity6 or other foreign intelligence agencies			1
the government has until now insisted its @entity9 eavesdropping centre does not use information gathered in the @entity11 to bypass restrictions on the what information can be gathered in @entity1			0
but in court documents released today , @entity9 admitted it scoops up information of ' unanalysed intercepted communications content ' from its @entity6 intelligence partner without a warrant			1
special relationship : @entity1 spies at @entity9 are allowed to mine @entity6 citizen 's telephone calls and emails without a warrant and with the agreement of the @entity26 campaign group @entity27 said the revelation exposed ' a huge gap in protection for @entity1 people '			1
a spokesman for the organisation , which is suing the @entity1 spy agency alongside @entity35 and @entity36 , said : ' the @entity1 public had been consistently persuaded by government over the last year that @entity9 are not using the @entity26 as a backdoor to sidestep protection in the law			2
' it means @entity1 spies can help themselves to data collected by the @entity26 without any oversight			0
@entity9 - which has refused to comment - has not revealed whose phone and email records it has trawled through			0
the agreement between the @entity26 and @entity9 allows the @entity1 to store anything discovered in the data for up to two years			2
but this deadline can be extended unilaterally by ' senior @entity1 officials ' if they believe it to be necessary for national security purposes			0
@entity9 was forced to draw back the veil on some of their top secret policies during a legal challenge to their practices following whistleblower @entity62 's revelations about the @entity26 last year			1
amongst the legal challengers were @entity36 and the @entity1 civil rights advocates , @entity35			0
embattled : the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) headquarters building in @entity66 , @entity67 ' we now know that data from any call , internet search , or website you visited over the past two years could be stored in @entity9 's database and analysed at will , all without a warrant to collect it in the first place , ' said @entity27 deputy director @entity77 to the @entity78			1
revelations : @entity62 exposed the full extent of the @entity26 and @entity9 's surveillance on @entity1 and @entity6 citizens ' it is outrageous that the government thinks mass surveillance , justified by secret ' arrangements ' that allow for vast and unrestrained receipt and analysis of foreign intelligence material is lawful			1
' generally , the @entity1 's intelligence gathering and data sharing is governed by the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , which generally demands a warrant for private data interception			0
however , the legal challenge has exposed the fact that the @entity1 and @entity9 do not deem a warrant necessary every time			1
' a @entity92 interception warrant is not as a matter of law required in all cases in which unanalyzed intercepted communications might be sought from a foreign government , ' states the document made public and sent by @entity9 to the @entity105 , which is the @entity1 intelligence watchdog			0
following the revelations of @entity6 intelligence worker @entity62 , @entity9 has been on the defensive over how it shares data with @entity6 spies			0
@entity1 lawmakers briefed by the agency have assured the public that a warrant was in place ' in each case where @entity9 sought information from the @entity6 ' a government spokesperson said : ' we do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings			2
