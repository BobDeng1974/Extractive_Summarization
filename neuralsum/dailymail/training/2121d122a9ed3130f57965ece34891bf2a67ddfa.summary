by @entity1 reporter published : 05:36 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 29 may 2013 they look the part , but these pieces of armour may not stand up to a @entity7 - style sword attack			2
each has been carefully crafted out of @entity9			2
the gooey protective garments are the work of @entity13 artist @entity12 who got the idea after having to use the stuff to protect his chapped skin			1
they look the part : two models wear the @entity9 armour made by @entity13 artist @entity12 but would they stop a sword ? the model on the left wears a helmet apparently designed after the style of ancient @entity31 armour , while the one on the left is wearing a ninja - style full face helmet but is it art ? mr @entity12 , 31 , who studied in @entity35 and @entity36 , has fashioned a range of helmets and chest armour by moulding the petroleum jelly - based product into shape two more models wear the unique helmets : in the artworks , mr @entity12 applies the @entity9 to the weak parts of the body such as the head , hand or chest ' a very important meaning in my individual living habits ' : how the jelly is applied			1
mr @entity12 says he uses @entity9 each winter to protect the skin on his hand , which was weakened by a bad burn he suffered as a child the 31 - year - old , who studied in @entity35 and @entity36 , has fashioned a range of helmets and chest armour by moulding the petroleum jelly - based product into shape			1
' i am interested in the function of @entity9 because it has a very important meaning in my individual living habits , ' the artist said			0
' every winter i need to apply @entity9 on my left - hand to prevent dryness , otherwise the skin becomes cracked because it is very thin and weak due to a burn that i got in my childhood			0
' i make the armour as an art work as it is a symbol of protection , with @entity9 for the weak parts of the body such as head , hand and chest			0
' i thought that armour was suitable for representing the meaning of @entity9 as a function of protection			0
' ' a symbol of protection ' : mr @entity12 in front of another of his artworks			1
