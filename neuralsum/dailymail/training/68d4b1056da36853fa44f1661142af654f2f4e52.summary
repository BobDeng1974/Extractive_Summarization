ever wondered who would rush to @entity2 ’s aid if he had to crash - land his sleigh ? or perhaps you ’ve pondered your local council ’s state of readiness for a zombie invasion ? if not , do n’t worry			1
someone , somewhere is asking these crucial questions			1
ridiculous request : @entity13 was asked to reveal who would be responsible for rescuing @entity2 if he crash - landed during his rounds they were two of the more bizarre queries put to local authorities under @entity20 laws this year			2
others centred on what measures might be being put in place to defend against @entity26 ’s army , how many drawing pins a town hall uses and how much taxpayers ’ money was paid to exorcists			2
the @entity31 unveiled its top ten list of bizarre @entity20 questions of 2011 to highlight the huge cost to taxpayers of frivolous requests			1
at the top was this request to @entity39 : how does the council plan to help the brave soldiers of our infantry if and when @entity26 and his marauding hordes invade the district ? the @entity47 emperor died in 1821 , six years after his defeat at @entity49			2
zombie nation : both @entity52 and @entity53 councils were asked what they would do in the event of an invasion by the undead @entity13 was asked to provide details of its contingency plans for a crash landing by @entity2			2
the applicant called for details about who at the council would rescue @entity2 , who would be responsible for rounding up the reindeer and which staff would get the job of clearing the crash site			0
both @entity69 and @entity70 were quizzed about their readiness for a zombie invasion , while @entity73 was asked about plans for an alien attack			0
the @entity76 gives people the right to ask any public body for information they have on any subject they choose			1
unless there ’s a good reason , the organisation must provide the information within 20 working days			0
nonsense : another wasteful question probed one council on how they would counter an attack by the long - deceased @entity26 and his 19th century army @entity91 , chairman of the @entity31 ’s improvement board , said : ‘ across the country , hundreds of @entity76 requests are sent to local authorities every day			1
‘ however , as this list shows , some of the requests do not appear to relate very closely to the services councils are focused on delivering			1
’ more than 197,000 requests for information were made to councils this year			1
the local authorities spent £ 31.6million responding			0
@entity104 was asked how many drawing pins there were in its town hall , and what percentage were stuck in a pin board			0
overly superstitious : one local authority was quizzed on how much it paid to exorcists ( posed by actors ) @entity114 was asked how many cheques were issued by the council and how many it received			0
the number of privacy walls between toilets was the hot topic for a @entity122 taxpayer			0
a request to @entity124 asked : how does the council manage to cope with the vagaries of @entity128 ’s @entity127 ? for the uninitiated , the quantum mechanics principle deals with the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the momentum and position of a sub-atomic particle .			0
