just a quarter of eighth and 12th grade students in the @entity2 have solid writing skills , even when allowed to use spell - check and other computer word processing tools , according to results of a national exam released on friday			1
twenty - four per cent of students at each grade level were able to write essays that were well developed , organized and had proper language and grammar			2
three per cent scored as advanced and the remaining students had just partial mastery of these skills			2
students who took the writing test inn 2011 had an advantage that previous test takers did not : a computer with spell - check and thesaurus			1
results are in : only twenty - four per cent of students at each grade level were able to write essays that were well developed , organized and had proper language and grammar ( stock photo ) ' it is important to remember this is first draft writing , ' said @entity30 , executive director of the @entity31 , which administers the @entity33 tests			1
' they did have some time to edit , but it was n't extensive editing , ' she added in comments to the @entity38			0
previously , students taking the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) writing test had to use pencil and paper , but with changes in technology , and the need to write across electronic formats , the decision was made to switch to computers			1
report card : the @entity40 is a congressionally authorized project she said word processing tools alone would n't result in significantly better writing scores if students did n't have the core skills of being able to organize ideas and present them in a clear and grammatical fashion			1
still , students in both grades who used the thesaurus and the backspace key more frequently had higher scores than those who used them less often			2
students in the 12th grade who had to write four or five pages a week for @entity71 homework also had higher scores			1
because this was the first version of the computerized test , the board cautioned against comparing the results to previous exams			0
in 2007 , 33 per cent of eighth grade students scored at the proficient level , which represents solid writing skills , as did 24 per cent at grade 12			1
the results at both grade levels showed a continued achievement gap between white , black , @entity86 and @entity87 students			1
at the eighth grade , @entity87 students had the highest average score , which was 33 points higher than black students on a 300 - point scale			1
at the 12th grade , white students scored 27 points above black students			1
the @entity40 is a congressionally authorized project of the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) within the @entity100 of the @entity2 @entity101			2
@entity102 said students use technology and tools like spell - check on a daily basis			2
' it 's as if years ago we had given them a pencil to write the essay and took away the eraser , ' she said			0
the numbers : a significant achievement gap was found between white , black , @entity86 and @entity87 students there was also a gender gap , with girls scoring 20 points higher on average than boys in the eighth grade and 14 points higher in 12th grade			1
those who qualified for free and reduced price lunch , a key indicator of poverty , also had lower scores than those who did not ; there was a 27 point difference between the two at the eighth grade			2
for the 2011 exam , laptops were brought into public and private schools across the country and more than 50,000 students were tested to get a nationally representative sample			1
students were given prompts that required them to write essays that explained , persuaded or conveyed an experience			0
writing skills : @entity2 students have become too reliant on using spell check on computers and lack basic writing skills , new exam results show ( stock photo ) @entity153 , a professor at @entity154 who served on the advisory panel for the test , said one factor to keep in mind is that research shows most students in the @entity2 do n't compose at the keyboard			1
' what they do is sort of type already written documents into the machine , much as we used to do with typewriters four decades ago , ' she said			0
@entity170 said for this reason , there was some concern about having students write on the computer as opposed to by hand			0
likewise , having the advantage of spell - check assumes students know how to use it			0
and in some schools and neighborhoods , computers are still not easily accessible			0
technology : in the first version of the computerized test , students still did n't have the core skills of being able to organize ideas and present them in a clear and grammatical fashion ' there are not so many students that actually learn to write composing at the keyboard , ' she said			0
@entity170 added that many kids who do have access to computers are not necessarily using them to write at school , but to take standardized tests and filling in bubbles			0
' digital technology is a technology , ' she said			0
' paper and pencil is a technology			0
if technology were the answer , that would be pretty simple			0
' progress ? ' if technology were the answer , that would be pretty simple , ' one education expert said admitting that access to technology is not the answer to helping students with their writing skills ( stock photo )			0
