by @entity0 and @entity1 a wave of strike action billed as the biggest co-ordinated walkout in 90 years by public sector unions was yesterday branded a damp squib			1
official estimates put overall turnout at less than half a million , well below the number claimed by unions			1
in the @entity12 , the @entity11 said just 18 per cent of staff had taken part – the smallest number ever to join a national strike			1
the @entity17 estimated 95 per cent of local council staff to be in work , and fire services in @entity21 were operational thanks to contingency planning			1
there were also no unplanned closures in the courts , and all 717 @entity27 in the country opened as usual			0
but the one - day action over pay and pensions was sufficient to close 21 per cent of schools , leaving thousands of parents having to take time off work or arrange emergency childcare			1
in some areas , almost all schools were affected , while in others – mainly shire counties – the walkout forced barely any closures			0
yesterday @entity83 said @entity84 did not believe ‘ illegitimate ’ walkouts causing disruption across vital public services can ever be justified , signalling that the @entity62 are examining tough new anti-strike laws			1
his official spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister ’s view is that he does n’t think it ’s right that public services should be disrupted			2
he does n’t believe people should face disruption , be it commuters or parents with children			0
’ senior conservatives are understood to be considering restricting the right to strike across professions where interruptions to services can endanger life , health or the ‘ normal living conditions ’ of the public			1
soldiers and policemen , for similar reasons , are already barred from walking out			0
such a move – on top of proposals for higher voting thresholds before strike action can be law and an end to ‘ never - ending ’ mandates for action that union leaders roll on indefinitely – would be highly controversial			1
yesterday some @entity43 boroughs saw the majority of schools close or partially close , including @entity122 and @entity123 , with 90 per cent affected , and @entity124 with 87 per cent			0
in @entity126 , 126 out of 177 schools were fully or partly closed , while in @entity127 , @entity128 , 57 out of 60 schools were affected			0
museums shut their doors in @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , some libraries were closed , and bin collections were halted in @entity137			0
the @entity138 estimated that the disruption cost the economy as much as £ 250million			2
alongside the @entity147 , members of the @entity143 , the @entity144 , the @entity145 , @entity146 and unite all took action			0
public sector workers in @entity31 , @entity43 , as they take part in the one - day walkout as part of bitter disputes over pay , pensions , jobs and spending cuts mix : teachers , firefighters , passport office workers , job centre advisers , courts staff and council workers joined the @entity43 march in the @entity170 , cabinet office minister @entity165 , who is in charge of the government ’s response to the strikes , questioned their legitimacy – saying they had been organised with the backing of tiny proportions of overall union memberships			1
he also pointed out that some of the ballots used to justify action were months or years out of date – with the @entity147 relying on a vote in 2012			0
mr @entity165 said the more often unions went on strike , the ‘ stronger the case ’ for a change in the law being included in the @entity187 ’ general election manifesto next year			1
@entity188 , which has received £ 23.6million in donations from unions involved in yesterday ’s strikes , refused to condemn them			2
leader @entity193 said : ‘ nobody wants to see these strikes because of the disruption that is being caused for parents and others			2
strikes are always a sign of failure on all sides but the key now is to prevent further strikes and further disruption happening			0
the answer is to get round the table and prevent further strikes happening			0
’ @entity210 general secretary @entity209 said : ‘ today ’s well - supported action shows just how angry public servants are at plans to lock them out of sharing in the recovery until at least 2018			1
‘ nearly half a million local government workers are paid less than the living wage – it is time that they shared in the growth that ministers trumpet			2
but rather than get round the table , ministers are threatening a change in the law that would make legal strikes close to impossible			0
’ conservative mp @entity227 said the ‘ real aim ’ of the strikes was ‘ to challenge the will of an elected government to deliver its policies – from deficit reduction to schools reform ’			2
he added : ‘ there should be a ban on strikes without the backing of a majority of union members			0
it ’s hardly right - wing : the public back this proposal by three to one			0
’ counter-claims : the government said it believed that 500,000 workers walked out today but unions said it was more than a million @entity210 members in @entity249 march through the city by politicians have argued their action lacks a mandate protest : teachers and staff from @entity256 in @entity257 , @entity258 are angry about cuts and pension changes			1

official estimates put well below the numbers claimed by the unions
only 18 *%* of @entity12 *employees* joined - the lowest in a national strike
@entity17 estimated 95 per cent of staff to be in work
@entity84 said ' illegitimate ' walkout did not cause any disruption
tories are now looking to *implement* tougher anti-strike laws
@entity324 , a @entity188 *parliamentary* **candidate** , caused anger after *retweeting* a message that *compared* @entity84 to @entity327 . the message said : ‘ 1933 , @entity327 bans trade unions in @entity330 . 2014 , @entity187 restrictions on public sector workers ’ *ability* to strike . ’ @entity187 mp @entity334 said the *comparison* was ‘ absolutely *disgusting* ’ and called for the **candidate** to be sacked .
