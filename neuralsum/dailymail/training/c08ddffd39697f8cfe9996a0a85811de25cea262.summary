a @entity1 inventor has done the seemingly impossible - and reinvented the wheel			1
the @entity4 system uses springs instead of spokes , giving the wheel built in suspension			1
the £ 600 wheel is set to go on sale in september following a hugely successful @entity12 campaign to raise money for the project			1
' in 2007 i was sitting in an airport in @entity38 , and i noticed when a mother pushed a pushchair against a kerb , the baby was pushed forward			0
' i suddenly wondered why the wheel could n't have its own suspension , and quickly drew the idea down - and then did nothing about it for two years			1
' then i had a spare afternoon and remembered the idea , so decided to make a model with springs made from plastic guttering i bought from @entity51 and a pencil as a hub - and it worked perfectly '			1
the @entity4 works using three heavy duty springs instead of spokes			2
when the rider hits a bump , the springs compress to give a smooth ride @entity61 inside the distinctive wheels compress as the rider encounters rough terrain @entity27 's original sketch for the wheel in 2007 mr @entity27 , who usually designs parts for pushchairs and other vehicles , has spent four years perfecting the idea			1
the current version is constructed from carbon composite strips developed in conjunction with an archery bow manufacturer			0
' i first made myself a mountain bike wheel , and it was incredibly noisy and would n't steer - but it worked			2
' i 've now been working on making it a product for 4 years , and we 've made 40 wheels and 200 springs to get it right			2
the first wheels are designed around the 20 - inch wheels commonly used on fold - up bicycle , and mr @entity27 plans to sell bikes with the wheels fitted for £ 1200 in september			1
' we 're at preproduction - we 've made wheels , but we 're now hoping to get funding for tooling so we can mass product them , and we are planning to spend the next two months getting production ready			2
' a @entity12 project has already raised £ 48,000 , exceeding the £ 40,000 target needed to get production started , and mr @entity27 , who is developing the wheel with his wife @entity99 , admitted he was stunned by the response			0
' we were very surprised by the response , 4 weeks ago nobody knew about them			0
' mr @entity27 said riding the wheels is a unique experience			0
' when you first sit on the bike , it feels normal			0
' but as soon as you ride , on a gravel road , it feels like velvet - there is no noise from the road , and it is exactly like riding a normal bike			1
once the 20inch wheel is in production , there are plans for a larger version for mountain bikes and even the possibility of a car version in the future			0
' there is no reason it could n't work in a car - although there are some big technical issues to solve			0
' the biggest problem we 've found so far is that you tend to ride through bumps quickly , slowing down for corners becomes a problem and you end up riding so fast .			0

large springs give the @entity139 built in suspension
44 year - old @entity28 inventor says it makes riding on a bumpy road ' feel like velvet '
set to go on sale in september for £ 600 and will fit existing bikes
