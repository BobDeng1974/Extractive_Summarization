complaint : this handwritten note was given to the mother , identified only as @entity11 , on february 13 , chastising her infant @entity28 for being aggressive and rough with her friends			1
according to the controversial missive , @entity11 's 9 - month - old daughter named @entity28 ' has been playing roughly and aggressively ’ with the other babies in the group			1
the author of the note goes on to say that after sowing mischief around her and leaving her friends upset and in tears , little @entity28 ' is smiling and enjoying herself			1
' @entity28 also was apparently not impressed when workers at the day care center told her in their ' firm voices ' that it was not acceptable to hurt others and gave her a time out			2
instead of learning her lesson , according to the note , the naughty 9 - month - old broke into a smile and went ' right back ' to the play area			0
the letter concludes with a plea to the child 's parents asking them to help change her behavior			1
' can you help us out by maybe discouraging her to not play roughly with her friends and her dog [ ? ] ' according to @entity17 's blog post about the letter , @entity28 's mother was angered by the day care 's suggestion that her daughter was somehow consciously drawing pleasure from hurting others			1
dr @entity62 , a psychologist at @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , told @entity66 that children @entity28 's age go through a phase where they are excited to see the effects their actions cause , and they can not yet recognize that what they are doing maybe be hurtful to others			2
research also shows that it is normal for children between the ages of 6 - 8 months to begin behaving in an aggressive manner because they are eager to express themselves but are not yet verbal			0
the child development expert noted that telling a mother her baby 's is being aggressive is at the very least unhelpful because as far as advice goes , it is too vague			0
‘ saying , “ i ’m concerned about your child because i ’m observing something different , ” is a great way to begin a conversation as opposed to , “ hey , your kid ’s being aggressive and you need to do something about it , ” ’ she said .			0
