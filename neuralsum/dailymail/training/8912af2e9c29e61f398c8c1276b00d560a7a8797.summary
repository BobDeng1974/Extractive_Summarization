@entity1 fans last night reacted with horror to the prospect of @entity4 returning to the club as a front - man for @entity8 billionaire @entity7			1
@entity9 - based @entity7 is said to have told @entity4 to make his move within the next seven days by offering shareholders 20p per share in order to become the club ’s biggest shareholder			1
if that move fails , it ’s believed @entity7 and @entity4 will offer the current board a £ 10million loan at five per cent interest , with the @entity21 training ground taken up as security over the deal			1
possible return : @entity4 says he does n't want to go back to @entity1 , but claims he may have to soon ‘ i ’ve got a number of people ready to invest in @entity1 , ’ @entity4 told the @entity25			1
‘ i ’ve told people this is a great club and a great opportunity			2
it ’s one of the world ’s biggest brands in terms of football			0
‘ i do n’t want to go back to @entity1 , i left unhappy last year and know it would n’t be right to go back			2
however , to see where the club is now is a disaster			0
‘ why @entity4 ? i ’m not applying to be the @entity39 but i wo n’t let the club continue to slide and become a laughing stock			1
what i ’m saying is if someone else can raise the money then great - if not , i ’ll do it			2
‘ it ’s a disjointed fan base and someone needs to stand up and say how it is			0
i ’ve made loads of mistakes i ’m not saying i ’m a good guy but i ’m certainly not the worst guy			0
billionaire : @entity8 @entity7 is planning to invest up to £ 10million in the @entity54 club ‘ i would n’t be involved at executive level or operationally but if i bring investors in , they ’ll want some kind of representation on the board			1
that could be me or someone else			0
’ on the opposition from fans , @entity4 added : ‘ raising cash is what i do			1
it ’s what i ’ve done for 30 years and it ’s all i do			0
what is important is that the club is saved			0
if the club does n’t raise cash , then it wo n’t be able to continue to trade			0
‘ if some fans would rather the club goes back into administration then they are not real fans			2
sit and wait and see what happens - if i do n’t raise the cash then that ’s it but if i do the club will be stronger			2
‘ @entity1 will get back to the @entity80 and when they do , they need to be competitive			0
when they get there , no - one wants to see them weak and humiliated			0
‘ fans need to unite			2
one week it ’s the @entity85 and then the @entity87 - there is no union of fans			2
‘ i ’d love to see all the fans unite and hate me - at least then they ’d be united			1
it ’s a disjointed fan base and someone needs to stand up and say it how it is			0
’ split : manager @entity95 publicly fell out with @entity4 last season , resulting in the ceo leaving the club @entity4 still has close links to the club via @entity101 , the man to whom he is said to have sold his shareholding last year			1
the @entity104 , however , is eyed with suspicion by a large section of the @entity1 support			0
@entity4 and his cohorts , including finance director @entity108 , were seen to benefit greatly from huge remuneration packages that went some way to ensuring the £ 23m raised by a share issue in december 2012 quickly evaporated			0
he left the club initially in april last year after a public spat with manager @entity95 and following his casual use of racist language - only to return three months later in a consultancy role			1
alleged business dealings with @entity118 damaged his reputation with the @entity1 support and he left for a second time last august			0
rumours that ’s he ’s still heavily involved behind the scenes and is close to a public return have lurked ever since			0
champions : despite the off - field turmoil @entity1 won the @entity127 title last season comfortably last night the @entity87 , the @entity1 supporters umbrella group , stated it was unequivocally opposed to his return			0
‘ simply put , @entity4 is not welcome at @entity1 and we believe any attempt by him to return would see a huge number of @entity1 fans seriously consider a full boycott of the club , ’ a statement read			1
‘ mr @entity4 lied to the @entity1 fans on more than one occasion			1
he presided over a period of mismanagement which has once again left the club on its knees financially			0
‘ at all times he acted in his own and his original investors interests and never in the interests of the club			2
‘ if he is indeed genuinely attempting to return then it will simply be to extract whatever more he can on behalf of the faceless investors he still represents			2
looking ahead : rangers hope their stay in the @entity152 will be a brief stop on the way back to the @entity155 ‘ it appears mr @entity4 is struggling to maintain his grasp on reality if he thinks @entity1 fans will accept a further pillaging of the club by his clients			1
‘ we expect the board to completely rule out any attempt from any further associates of mr @entity4 to get involved with @entity1			1
we also expect them to confirm that no members of the plc or “ football ” board have been involved in any attempt to bring further associates of mr @entity4 into the club			1
‘ the £ 10m , even if it exists , is a sticking plaster on a gaping wound and made all the worse by @entity4 ’s record of syphoning any money invested in the club straight back out			1
’ yesterday ’s developments comes at the end of a week in which the board confirmed it hoped to raise £ 4m via a fresh share issue to cover a funding gap			0
existing shareholders will be given the first option on purchasing shares with institutional investors being asked to underwrite the scheme			0
