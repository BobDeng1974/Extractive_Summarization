by @entity0 sitting at the desk in @entity4 ’s old wood - panelled study , it ’s easy to see why the world - renowned author was so enamoured of @entity7 , his home in the coastal @entity10 village of @entity11 , where he wrote his just so stories			1
for the view from the bow windows – featuring the village green and pond , as well as the flint walls of the cosy @entity19 and the old blacksmith ’s in the distance – is just so @entity22			2
a portrait of @entity4 sitting here , surveying a scene that has barely changed in more than 100 years , now hangs in the @entity26			1
so charming : @entity7 , @entity4 's £ 1.45million home in the coastal @entity10 village of @entity11 , is where he wrote his @entity30 stories one can imagine him twirling his famous moustache and seeking inspiration for his novel @entity35 and poem @entity36 , which he also wrote here			1
if that failed , a walk up to the first and second floors reveals views that take in a windmill , the 13th @entity42 across the road , the @entity44 and the twinkling @entity45			0
@entity4 , also author of @entity47 , rented the house for three guineas a week from 1897 to 1902 after discovering @entity11 when he stayed with his aunt @entity50			1
she was married to the pre-raphaelite painter @entity51 , who lived on the other side of the green			0
in his autobiography , @entity54 , @entity4 says of @entity7 : ‘ it stood in a sort of little island behind flint walls which we then thought high enough , and almost beneath some big ilex trees			1
it was small , none too well built , but cheap , and so suited us			0
’ impressive : the double - fronted home that has five bedrooms , three reception rooms and three bathrooms in the same tome he remembers his time in @entity11 – with his wife @entity70 and daughters @entity72 and @entity73 – as a tranquil period in his life			1
‘ beyond turning out at 2am to help a silly foxhound puppy who had stuck in a drain , i do not remember any violent alarms and excursions other than packing farm - carts filled with babies and despatching them into the safe , clean heart of the motherly downs for jam - smeared picnics			2
’ indeed , he only decided to move on when the owner of a hotel on the seafront organised buses to bring people out from @entity91 to gawp at the home of , at the time , one of the most famous people in the country			2
that , and the fact that , when he enquired about buying the property , the owner , a mr @entity102 , quoted a price so outrageous that @entity4 responded : ‘ obviously you think that there is a goldmine under the green			2
’ @entity4 instead sought peace in the @entity10 countryside at @entity107 , where his magnificent former residence @entity109 is now open to the public through the @entity111			1
famous resident : @entity4 rented @entity7 for three guineas a week from 1897 to 1902 still tucked behind those same high flint walls , the @entity11 house , which dates back to 1745 , is now an imposing double - fronted home that has five bedrooms , three reception rooms and three bathrooms , and is on the market for £ 1.45 million			1
the present owners , @entity122 and @entity123 , both in their 70s , bought the @entity126 listed property from the daughter of the writer @entity128 in 1978			0
@entity128 was the author of @entity129 , which was made into a movie starring a young @entity131 , and the play @entity133			0
she was also @entity134 ’s great - grandmother			2
but by the time the @entity136 arrived , the house was in a sorry state			0
‘ it was a total wreck , ’ says @entity122 , a retired manufacturer of hotel interiors			0
‘ everything was taken back and rebuilt			0
we did n’t move in for two years and lived nearby in @entity91 while the work was carried out			0
’ an impressive hallway now leads to a new kitchen with oak floor , and large bay window doors open out on to a patio and side garden			0
there ’s a dining room off the kitchen , a lounge , @entity4 ’s former study of course , and stairs down to the large cellar rooms			2
on the first floor a large drawing room overlooks the green , there ’s a master bedroom with en suite bathroom and a dressing area that overlooks the garden , and a second large bedroom			0
the top floor is home to three further bedrooms			0
the @entity136 , who have two grown - up daughters and a son , might be selling the house , but they are not leaving @entity11			1
ingeniously , they have built on top of the old cellar at the back of the house and incorporated the old maid ’s quarters to create a new two - bedroom cottage for themselves			1
‘ we love the area			0
our children grew up here and have moved on so we no longer needed the space , but we never had any intention of moving away , ’ says @entity122			0
‘ @entity11 has everything – pubs , restaurants , shops and its own beach – and @entity91 , with its 50 - minute train service to @entity192 , is just three miles away			1
’ by coincidence , the house owned by @entity4 ’s uncle and aunt is also on the market – with an asking price of £ 675,000			1
the four - storey , three - bedroom @entity126 listed @entity200 – last sold for £ 499,950 in 2008 – is a blue - plaque house like @entity7			1
two historic houses for sale opposite each other , separated by a quintessentially @entity22 village green			2
just so ... the @entity7 is for sale through @entity206 ( 01273 772175 ) and @entity200 via @entity207 ( 01273 309968 )			1

@entity4 wrote his just so stories at @entity7 in @entity10
the five - bedroom home in @entity11 village is now up for sale
the @entity7 dates back to 1745 and is on the market for £ 1.45million
