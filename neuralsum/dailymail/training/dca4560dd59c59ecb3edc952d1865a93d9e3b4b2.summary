it has long been assumed that @entity1 simply sells old , unwanted stock at a heavily discounted price			1
but these ' deals ' might not be what they seem			0
rather , the outlet store is actually selling knock - offs of its own products , creating a separate line of lower - quality goods that look similar to what can be found in the main retail store			1
according to @entity15 , most outlet items from @entity1 , @entity14 and even off 5th are simply ' based on ( full - price ) products sold in previous seasons '			1
spot the difference : @entity1 's linen @entity22 dress from last summer , $ 148 ( left ) is available online at @entity1 for $ 104.50 ( right ) , however the outlet dress is made from cotton and features a mismatched seam @entity26 factory store , off 5th , even admitted to investors last year that only 10per cent of the outlet merchandise is leftover @entity26 inventory			1
with 25per cent of the factory stock made up of private - label goods from brands like @entity36 and @entity37 , the rest , 65per cent , is actually merchandise created specifically for @entity26 by ' brand - appropriate ' vendors			2
@entity41 , the department store 's popular discount store , does this too			0
the company notes in a press release : ' @entity47 carries merchandise from @entity41 stores and @entity49 , as well as specially - purchased items from many of the top brands sold at @entity41			2
' close match : @entity1 's @entity55 striped loafers , $ 168 ( left ) feature leather soles and are made in @entity57 ; the @entity1 version , $ 74.50 ( right ) features a man - made sole with slight style differences flower power : last summer 's @entity64 scoop dress , made from silk dupioni , retailed at @entity1 for $ 178 ( left ) ; the near identical dress is selling at @entity1 for $ 74.50 , but it is made from polyester to an untrained eye , @entity1 's version looks like it is the same dress , just two seasons old			1
but in fact , the near identical dress , selling for $ 74.50 , is made from polyester			0
items sold at the @entity1 , both online and in store , will often use the same prints as full - priced items , but the fabric can be markedly different			1
take for example , last summer 's @entity64 scoop dress , which was made from silk dupioni and retailed at @entity1 for $ 178			2
to an untrained eye , @entity1 's version looks like it is the same dress , just two seasons old			2
but in fact , the near identical dress , selling for $ 74.50 , is made from polyester			0
similarly , @entity1 's well - known linen @entity22 dress from last summer ( $ 148 ) is also available online at @entity1			1
however , the outlet dress ( $ 104.50 ) is made from cotton , and unlike the full - priced version , a mismatched seam can be found at the back			1
@entity92 noted that retailers recognize the profitability of attracting people who are looking for a deal , so they are building an industry around outlet shopping that is completely separate from their regular business these ' potentially misleading marketing practices by outlet stores ' are now being investigated by the @entity104 after four members of @entity106 looked at ' the difficulty in identifying made - for - outlet goods ' and the ' deceptive reference pricing			1
' and @entity1 is n't alone			2
@entity108 told investors that it sustains its outlets with 65per cent made - for - outlet merchandise , while @entity112 has said it anticipates carrying 75per cent made - for - factory items starting this year			0
under @entity114 said in september that its outlets carry 75per cent made - for - outlet goods , while @entity116 and high - end luggage maker @entity117 have said 85per cent of their outlet goods are made - for - factory			0
@entity92 noted in 2011 that as retailers have begun to recognize the profitability of attracting @entity123 -- and even tourists -- who are looking for a deal , they are now building an industry around outlet shopping that is completely separate from their regular business			0
@entity26 factory store , off 5th , admitted to investors last year that only 10per cent of the outlet merchandise is leftover @entity26 inventory an outlet buyer for a luxury department store in @entity138 , who wished to remain anonymous , explained : ' i would guess that only about 10 - 15per cent of our outlet â€™s stock was actually items that the main store carried			1
the rest of it was merchandise we bought or produced for the outlets			0
' while there are sometimes ways to tell whether the merchandise came from a full - price store or whether it 's a cheaper version of the real thing -- @entity155 puts two some dots on its tags and the @entity14 outlet marks its products with three dots -- customers continue to feel duped			1
' i personally am unhappy with the way @entity1 is handling their outlet merchandise , ' said one commenter named @entity167 on the blog @entity169			2
' do n't get me started on the outlet t - shirts that look very similar to the perfect fit t 's , but they tend to lose their shape and pill			0
' she continued : ' i was at the outlet last weekend and i decided to try on a pair of cropped black " mini pants " and as a put my leg into the pantleg it split from inseam to knee			0
( the size i tried on is one larger then i usually wear in the retail store -- it 's all they had )			0
this was n't an error of size , but quality			0

clothes found in outlet stores are simply ' based on ' old , full - price stock
@entity1 uses cheaper fabrics to produce lower quality products
