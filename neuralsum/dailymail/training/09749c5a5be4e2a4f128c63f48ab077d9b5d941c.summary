@entity0 has criticised the head of @entity2 over his warning that schools are struggling to cope with an ‘ influx ’ of migrants			1
the @entity7 said sir @entity9 ’s language was not ‘ helpful ’ and insisted many schools are doing ‘ extremely well ’ with pupils who speak @entity12 as a second language			1
her remarks come amid simmering tensions between the @entity16 and sir @entity9 following a series of public clashes			2
sir @entity9 , chief inspector of schools , said schools needed the resources to cope with an influx of immigration but education secretary @entity0 said the comments were not helpful mrs @entity25 last month contradicted the watchdog over inspection procedures for flagship academies and expressed irritation over the timing of follow - up visits to the so - called ‘ @entity33 ’ schools			1
in a further blow to sir @entity9 , a leaked memo revealed that calls for him to be sacked were made within the government last year , over concerns about his running of the watchdog			1
in a speech addressing critics last week , the chief inspector of schools admitted @entity2 would ‘ not win any popularity contests ’			0
the latest clash follows a warning by sir @entity9 that schools need more help to deal with growing numbers of non-native @entity12 speakers			1
during a phone - in on @entity53 last week , he was told of a school where teachers had to carry out ‘ double the work ’ due to a ‘ huge influx ’ of children who could not speak @entity12			1
‘ schools need the resources to deal with that , ’ sir @entity9 said			1
‘ when they ’re faced with an influx of children from other countries , they need the resources and capacity to deal with it , and if those resources are n’t there , that ’s a big issue for government			1
that ’s the first thing and we ’ll be producing reports on this fairly soon			0
’ in a subsequent @entity53 phone - in , mrs @entity25 was asked whether she agreed with sir @entity9 that schools were being ‘ overrun by children from migrant communities ’			1
the education secretary , who is also mp for @entity82 , said : ‘ obviously sir @entity9 has gone round to various schools but no , when i go round schools i see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad			1
‘ i am not sure that sort of language is always helpful but there are challenges and there are parts of the country where we know that there are higher numbers of students who do n’t speak @entity12 as a first language			1
‘ i know from my own constituency that can bring challenges but i also know schools that cope extremely well with that and actually i ’ve been to a school recently in my constituency where they have had a situation and children are doing absolutely brilliantly			2
’ asked whether sir @entity9 should have chosen his words more carefully , mrs @entity25 added : ‘ this whole area of immigration is an area where we need to be very careful about the language that we use			1
‘ it is n’t that it is n’t a concern to people because it absolutely is but we also need to think about the language and the tone of the debate that we use			0
‘ we need to tackle the issue in a sensitive way without saying there is n’t a problem because people are clearly concerned about it			0
’ in the @entity125 today , @entity124 told @entity126 that schools and hospitals were under pressure from immigration the intervention came after @entity124 told the @entity132 that schools and hospitals were under pressure from immigration			0
during heated exchanges with @entity138 ’s @entity137 , the prime minister said the @entity141 people ‘ just want this issue sorted ’			0
concerns about the impact of migration on public services were also voiced by defence secretary @entity146 , who said some towns were ‘ swamped ’ by @entity149 migrants , leaving communities ‘ under siege ’			0
he later retracted the comments , with a @entity154 source saying he accepted he ‘ should have chosen his words better ’ and should have said some communities felt ‘ under pressure ’			0
official figures show the number of schoolchildren who speak @entity12 as a second language has risen to 1.1million			2
almost one in five primary pupils are non-native speakers and one in seven at secondary level			0
the number of youngsters needing extra help with @entity12 at school has risen by about a third in five years			0
at some schools , dozens of different languages are spoken			0
in nearly 20 local authorities , fewer than half of primary school children are native speakers – and in parts of @entity180 , only a quarter of primary pupils count @entity12 as their first language			2
tensions between the government and sir @entity9 burst into the open last month when mrs @entity25 publicly contradicted the @entity2 chief and dismissed his demands for more powers to inspect groups that operate academies			2
it also emerged that the @entity7 had expressed concern over the ‘ unhelpful ’ timing of follow - up visits to schools implicated in the so - called @entity33 plot to impose strict @entity197 practices in the classroom			0
the inspections suggested little had changed in the schools but mrs @entity25 said a ‘ great deal of progress ’ had been made since the @entity2 visits			2
there is also believed to be frustration within the @entity16 over @entity2 ’s handling of some inspections since new rules were introduced to tackle the threat of extremists infiltrating schools			0
in one case , the watchdog was forced to withdraw a report on a catholic school in rural @entity216 which had been marked down for failing to do enough to ‘ teach students about the dangers of extremism and radicalisation ’			0
meanwhile a leaked memo written last year revealed that mrs @entity25 ’s predecessor , @entity222 , considered replacing sir @entity9 over concerns that @entity2 under his leadership was a ‘ serious and growing problem ’ .			1

sir @entity9 said schools need help to deal with *foreign* children
he said the ' resources are *n't* there ' , which is ' a big issue for government '
education secretary @entity0 hit back at warning over ' influx '
insists many schools are doing ‘ extremely well ’ with pupils who speak @entity12 as a second language
