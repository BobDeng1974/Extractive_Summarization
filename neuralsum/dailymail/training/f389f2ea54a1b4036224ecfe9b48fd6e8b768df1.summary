@entity0 ensured there was no repeat of @entity4 's bad habits and old frailties as they took a giant step towards a series victory over @entity9 on day two of the fifth @entity10			1
@entity0 's unbeaten 92 , a triumph of calm and then acceleration in stands of 80 with @entity15 and an unbroken 67 in only 10 overs with @entity17 , meant the hosts could quickly forget about their mini-collapse of three wickets for 13 runs			1
so close : @entity4 captain @entity22 missed out on an elusive century despite two reprieves they were able to close on 385 for seven , with a lead of 237 and power still to add at @entity27 - where captain @entity22 ( 79 ) and @entity29 ( 64 ) also contributed half - centuries			1
second - wicket pair @entity22 and @entity29 were part of that mid-afternoon wobble , after a partnership of 125 , leaving @entity0 and @entity15 to put things right			1
@entity0 especially did so to great effect , needing 93 balls for his fifth 50 of this series but then taking toll of a flagging attack as he hit seven more boundaries from only another 36 deliveries			1
influential : @entity4 's @entity0 continued his rich vein for form by scoring a sparkling 92 @entity29 had lavish praise for his fellow @entity47 batsman , and pointed out too that @entity4 of the recent past might easily have gone into terminal decline - as they did so often in last winter 's ashes and on several occasions this summer too - once wickets began to tumble			1
' it was a bit of a wobble , a bit of a collapse - which is not ideal , ' he said			2
' early on in the summer , it could have been an eight or nine - wicket collapse - but it was only four			2
' they bowled well at us and got a few wickets , but the way @entity62 and @entity63 counter-attacked was brilliant ... and really put us in a strong position			0
' threat : @entity4 's @entity15 takes evasive action during the second day of the fifth test barring a major recovery of the tourists ' composure after two successive defeats already , @entity4 ought to convert their mid-match advantage into a 3 - 1 series win - and @entity0 once more has played a significant part			1
' he 's played very positively , ' added @entity29			0
' he was patient , and got used to the pace of the wicket and then looked to score ( more quickly ) - and that 's what he 's done very well this summer			2
' he 's obviously got that ability ( to change gear in an innings ) , and today he had a chance to put pressure back on @entity9 and did that very well and scored very quickly			2
got him : @entity9 's @entity86 celebrates bowling @entity87 of @entity4 for 37 runs ' to watch how he 's handled it after a tough tour of @entity91 and come back this summer and scored big , big runs - when the team needed them - just shows he 's a quality player			1
' @entity9 off - spinner @entity95 has been impressed too by @entity0 's energetic yet controlled approach to batting			1
' he 's a positive player , and is expressing himself more - for whatever reason			2
' he 's a hard competitor who i 'd love to compete against every time i go out			0
' @entity100 in hands : @entity9 's @entity86 shows his disappointment as @entity22 leads charmed life @entity29 , meanwhile , was able to reflect with satisfaction on another 50 - his sixth in 11 innings this summer - from the number three position previously filled so well for so long by @entity108			0
' i had n't batted much there before , but i 've had a few gos this summer and feel quite good there now , ' said the successful new incumbent			0
' @entity115 's shoes are massive to fill			0
he did so well over five or six years , and scored huge runs ... but i hope i can look at what he did well , and try to replicate that			0
' @entity29 appeared to have a fourth century in his sights in only his eighth test , before an unusually tame dismissal to @entity95			0
' i was very disappointed to get out when i did			0
i thought i had a good chance to get a hundred there			0
' you do n't want to say you feel at home , because it 's international sport and it 's tough			0
' ( but ) i feel much more confident after this summer , and feel like i can do a decent job and kick on , have a decent career and put @entity4 in winning positions .			1
