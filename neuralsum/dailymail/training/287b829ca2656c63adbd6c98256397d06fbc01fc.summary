the group snatched the girls from their boarding school in @entity11 in the lawless @entity13 region in the north of the country			1
a former mediator who once brokered peace talks with the group has told the @entity18 he believes the video , where @entity21 leader @entity20 threatens to sell the girls as slaves , shows he plans to use them as ‘ bargaining chips ’ rather than kill them			1
he told the newspaper : ‘ from my knowledge of the group , to have him saying that he will sell them is proof that this issue can be resolved			0
‘ the group is most likely to want to attach some kind of conditions to the girls being released , such as the freeing of some of their own prisoners			1
’ the brazenness of the kidnap has shocked @entity3 , who have been growing accustomed to hearing about atrocities in the five - year - old @entity5 insurgency in the north in the video , the @entity21 leader is seen dressed in combat fatigues standing in front of an armoured personnel carrier and two pick - up trucks mounted with sub-machine guns			2

the school in @entity11 in @entity3 , where nearly 300 schoolgirls were abducted by @entity21 on tuesday it was reported that @entity118 were on standby to help in the rescue effort to free the missing girls			1
the director of @entity118 has told the @entity122 that @entity124 personnel could support the @entity3 armed forces with drones , intelligence , military planning or even join a rescue			0
however , top brass are reluctant to take part in a raid after the botched @entity134 mission in which @entity124 construction worker @entity135 , 28 , was executed by his @entity3 kidnappers in march 2012			0
the @entity137 has also branded the kidnapping an ‘ outrage and tragedy ’ and the @entity138 said the @entity139 would send a ‘ co-ordination cell ’ including military personnel and law experts to @entity3 .			0
