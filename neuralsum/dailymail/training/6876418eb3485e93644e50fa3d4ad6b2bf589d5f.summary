’ he told @entity120 that the fight against @entity123 extremism is akin to a new @entity124 , and could last for many years			0
‘ it is not unlike the @entity124 , where we did not just pursue those who wanted to do us such harm , we also had to challenge all those who gave them succour			0
that is what we need to do in a struggle which , as i have said , i think will last for decades			0

government sources at the summit said mr @entity0 and mr @entity1 ’s message would be ‘ we ’ll win against the psychopaths ’			2

this is a threat to civilisation			0
’ he accused mr @entity1 of being indecisive on foreign policy – a sentiment being expressed widely in @entity160 and @entity161			0
he said : ‘ as much as i respect him , he ’s very long on analysis , but he ’s not quite as fleet of foot on being decisive			0
