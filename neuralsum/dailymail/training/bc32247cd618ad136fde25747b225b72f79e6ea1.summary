many brides find themselves desperately trying to lose a pound or two just before their big day to make sure they fit into their dress			1
@entity3 had a more drastic plan			2
she was so determined to lose weight for her wedding that she decided to have plastic surgery – and sold her house to pay for it			1
mrs @entity3 , who weighed 18 stone at her heaviest , spent £ 22,000 on a variety of cosmetic operations abroad , including a gastric band which helped her drop seven dress sizes and lose ten stone			1
investment : @entity3 paid £ 19,000 towards surgery - as well as spending £ 3,000 - on travel @entity3 was overjoyed to be a beautiful bride			1
@entity20 when she weighed 18st			1
' i 'd struggled with my weight all my life , ' she says the money came from her £ 80,000 semi-detached house , which she put on the market within weeks of her engagement to her then fiance , @entity28			1
seven years on , the couple have finally tied the knot – and mrs @entity3 is convinced it all was worth it			2
last night the 34 - year - old said : ‘ people thought i was insane , but i knew it was the right thing to do			0
‘ it was the first house i ’d ever bought , it had a massive garden and i was proud of it			0
but more than anything i wanted to look amazing on my wedding day			2
’ @entity3 in hospital after surgery in @entity43 where she had a gastric band fitting , an arm and thigh lift as well as breast implants , costing £ 22,000 in total @entity3 's final procedure was a tummy tuck to remove the excess skin she was left with after her weight loss ( left ) , though the operation left her with bruising ( right ) but she says it was all worth it @entity3 met @entity55 through her job as a receptionist for a taxi firm when he called up to book a car in 2003 @entity3 said that although @entity55 , pictured with her at her heaviest , loved her regardless , she did n't want to be an overweight bride at her heaviest , 5ft 1in mrs @entity3 weighed 18 stone and wore a dress size 24			1
‘ i hated myself so much , ’ she said			0
‘ i used to end up in tears when i went shopping – nothing fitted , and as well as the embarrassment , walking around the shops would leave me breathless and in agony as i was so big			0
’ in 2003 mrs @entity3 , who worked as a receptionist in a taxi firm , took a phone call ‘ from a friendly - sounding male voice , who turned out to be @entity28 ’			1
‘ he ’d only phoned for a taxi , but he was warm , funny and friendly , and for months we swapped messages and chatted on the phone before i plucked up the courage to meet him , ’ she said			0
@entity3 says her lack of self confidence about her size before the weight loss ( left ) made it easy to make the extreme decision to sell her home to fund the cosmetic surgery to give her her dream body ( right ) ‘ i was certain he ’d be put off by my body but @entity28 did n’t bat an eyelid			1
he loved me for me and our relationship quickly blossomed			0
three years later , in 2006 , he proposed			0
‘ but then it hit me – this awful vision of a bulging bride waddling down the aisle			0
i did n’t want @entity28 to have to marry me while i looked like that			2
i wanted to be a beautiful bride			0
’ mrs @entity3 did n’t have any savings , but she did own her own home			2
so she made the decision to sell the property , in @entity105 , and move in with @entity28 , who lived in @entity106 , @entity107			1
@entity3 shrunk to a trim size 10 and her breasts shrunk from a size @entity110 to a @entity112 the house sold for £ 80,000 and , after clearing the £ 55,000 mortgage , mrs @entity3 was left with £ 25,000 for her plastic surgery			1
in april 2006 she travelled to a private clinic in @entity43 for her first operation , a gastric band procedure which cost £ 8,000			1
in two years she shed ten stone , going from a size 24 to a size ten			1
her bra size also went down to a @entity112 from a @entity123			1
after spending £ 22,000 on surgery , @entity3 is finally happy with what she sees in the mirror in 2008 she travelled back to the clinic for three further operations			2
in june that year she spent £ 4,000 on arm and thigh lifts , followed by £ 3,700 for a breast lift and liposuction three months later			1
she spent another £ 3,500 on a further breast uplift in december			2
the procedures alone cost £ 19,000 , but with travel and accommodation the total bill was £ 22,000			0
mrs @entity3 , who now runs her own business selling customised pram covers , said : ‘ it was a huge amount to pay for cosmetic surgery , and i know some people would think badly of me for it , but it was worth every penny			2
‘ after every painful operation i kept telling myself that the end result would be worth it			0
when i started seeing the results , i could feel my confidence soaring			0
i felt like a brand new person and for the first time in my life , i felt sexy			0
’ the final operation on mrs @entity3 ’s list was a tummy tuck , scheduled for april 2009			1
but that , and the couple ’s wedding plans , had to be put on hold when she became pregnant with her son @entity162 , now four			2
instead she had the operation in october 2009 , two months after his birth			0
mrs @entity3 was eligible for the tummy tuck on the @entity166 , because doctors agreed the excess skin she was carrying around her stomach was affecting her self - esteem and mental wellbeing			1
the couple finally tied the knot on their ten - year anniversary , on may 18 this year			0
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ i had my slim - fit wedding dress ready and waiting and i was so excited to put it on and walk down the aisle			1
i felt like a princess			0
‘ i really do feel like the luckiest bride in the world			0
