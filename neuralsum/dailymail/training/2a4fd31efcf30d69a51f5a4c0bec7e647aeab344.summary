by @entity0 the most worrying thing about @entity3 ’s exit is the fact it suggested a regression in the mental side of his game to the pre-ivan @entity9 days			1
he lost meekly and there was no fighting spirit			0
it was a 1/10 performance from a mental point of view — the sort of display that you would never conceive of from a great player like he is			2
@entity3 had the demeanour of a first - round loser rather than a defending champion and he deserves to be criticised for his poor attitude			0
he was grumbling right from the start of the match and giving all the wrong signals to his opponent @entity26 , who himself was nervous and there for the taking at times			0
anger : @entity3 was out of sorts against @entity26 and seemed to lose his head control : @entity3 ( left ) must get back the grasp of his emotions he had under @entity9 ( right ) support team : @entity3 's coach @entity36 ( right ) and @entity37 at @entity38 fallout : @entity3 's quarter - final exit at @entity38 has led to him having to re-assess his team i do n’t know why @entity3 was shouting ‘ f * * * * * * five minutes before the match , ’ up at his box but that is the sort of negative thing he cut out under @entity9 and it ’s creeping back in again			1
i do n’t think he ’ll end his partnership with @entity36 immediately and she deserves some time but it has n’t been an immediate success			0
there were concerning signs from the start			0
@entity3 said he ’d appointed her because she was a ‘ good listener ’			0
well i ’ve got news for him – it ’s you who should be doing the listening , not the other way round			0
@entity36 is a @entity61 winner and was tactically very good throughout her career but @entity3 needs someone who will set standards and enforce rules , not simply someone to lend an ear			1
after the match he said he was going to go away and work on certain aspects of his game but i think he was playing the best tennis of his life in the opening three rounds - there did n’t seem to be any problems with his form			1
it is 90 per cent mental with @entity3 and that ’s the area he needs to address because if he does n’t get back to how he was in the @entity9 days he wo n’t win another @entity61			1
error : @entity36 looks glum on @entity81 as @entity3 crashes out in the quarter - finals pushing himself ? or maybe , the disastrous performance was all down to @entity3 himself ? @entity9 cut out his main weakness , which was the mental side , and him not being in his corner this time round was a big negative			1
i do n’t think dropping down to 10 in the world is a big crisis for @entity3 but he does need to get back on the right track quickly			1
if @entity36 does n’t stay around i think he still needs a @entity61 winner as his coach , someone who has been as good , if not better , than he is			2
he might look towards someone like @entity97 , @entity98 or even @entity99 , if they would do the job and commit to the travelling			1
his assistant coach and hitting partner @entity37 has been a big part of his success over the years			0
they first met at a @entity109 tennis academy and he has been by @entity3 ’s side almost constantly for the last four years			2
but in football the assistant manager usually wants to move up and be the boss eventually			0
@entity37 might be getting frustrated about being told ‘ you ’re doing a good job but i need someone extra , a big name to be the main coach ’			0
that ’s possibly a source of friction			0
experience : @entity3 could look to a former @entity61 champion like @entity97 ( pictured ) as a coach @entity125 is our top young prospect in the men ’s game and we ’ve got a lot riding on him			1
he ’s 320 in the world but is still only 19			0
the question is whether his coach @entity133 has the credentials to take him to the next level			2
i ’m not sure how many days @entity133 is contracted to work with @entity125 but at this stage in his career he needs someone there all the time and i ’m not sure having a part - time coach is the best idea			1
@entity133 plays a lot of seniors matches , does tv work and makes a lot of corporate appearances so i ’m not sure he ’s in the position where @entity125 is his priority week in , week out			1
@entity125 has the potential to be a top player but what you do n’t want to see is him regressing because he does n’t have the right team around him			1
potential : @entity125 is the top @entity157 prospect and @entity133 could be great for him @entity158 is a great story - to be one game away from being an eight - time @entity38 champion is absolutely mind - boggling			1
he loves the game more than anyone and that has been clear this fortnight			0
the fact that he is still at the top of his game as a father of four is credit to the team he has around him , particularly his wife @entity173			2
everything is very regimented with @entity158 as i understand - every part of his life , from training to eating to spending time with his kids , is mapped out with military precision often parents on tour feel torn because their family stay at home while they travel but @entity158 ’s family go everywhere with him so he does n’t have that dilemma			2
i heard that he and his wife have never spent a night apart since they married and she is definitely his rock			0
the crowd are likely to be heavily behind @entity158 but i think @entity190 will be holding the winner ’s trophy - he might just get too many balls back into play to counteract @entity158 ’s serve			2
incredible : @entity158 is one win away from a record eighth @entity38 title regimented : @entity158 and his wife , @entity173 ( pictured ) , have his life mapped out to the minute			1

@entity9 had helped @entity3 to cut out *petulance* from his game
against @entity205 frustration and anger crept back into his game
@entity3 should give @entity36 more of a chance and should listen to her
he could look to @entity97 , @entity99 or @entity98 as coach
@entity125 is the top young @entity157 prospect at the moment
@entity125 is coached by @entity133 who can help him be great
@entity158 could win a record eighth @entity38 title on *sunday*
his life is worked out to the minute so he can be father and a tennis player
