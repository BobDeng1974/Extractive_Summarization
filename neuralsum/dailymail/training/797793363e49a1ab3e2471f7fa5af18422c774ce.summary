the @entity2 's leadership in @entity3 and @entity4 has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes , leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader @entity8 , it is claimed			1
@entity10 airstrikes , including those carried out by @entity13 warplanes , have killed more than 6,000 fighters since september , including more than half the militants serving on @entity17 ' ruling council			1
among the dead jihadis is @entity19 , a former @entity4 army lieutenant colonel considered @entity23 's number two and @entity17 ' most senior militant in @entity4			1
his death and that of as many as nine others on @entity17 ' 18 - man leadership council have forced @entity23 to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders , as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle - hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small			2
another former member of @entity44 's army turned @entity17 commander , @entity45 ( right ) , has also been killed @entity46 : @entity17 ' leadership has been left in chaos following the deaths of many of its senior commanders @entity23 has not been seen in public since july and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes			1
the likelihood , however , is that @entity23 has been forced deep into hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months			0
other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of @entity3 and @entity4 that remain under @entity17 ' control			2
this forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead , or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if @entity17 ' rivals on the ground			0
targeted : @entity83 ( left ) - who had been the head of @entity23 's four man military council - was killed by a coalition warplane last year			2
another militant reportedly killed in an airstrike was @entity89 ( right ) who had been one of @entity23 's most trusted advisers on the @entity91 despite the serious damage done to @entity17 ' leadership by the airstrikes , scores of prominent militants remain alive , including the terror group 's @entity13 executioner in chief , @entity97 among the @entity17 leadership figures killed in airstrikes in recent months is @entity45 , according to the @entity103 former member of @entity44 's army , @entity106 - real name @entity102 - had been a prominent member of @entity17 ' military council before his death			1
also killed by coalition airstrikes last year was @entity83 - who had been the head of @entity23 's four man military council , having previously served on the terror leader 's religious and strategic advisory body , known as the @entity91			1
another militant reportedly killed by the first wave of coalition airstrikes in september was @entity89 , also known as @entity116 , who had been one of @entity23 's most trusted advisers on the @entity91			2
his death came two months before that of @entity119			0
real name @entity120 , whose official title was believed to have been governor of ' @entity124 '			0
@entity126 ' role was to ensure @entity17 ' barbaric interpretation of @entity129 law was enforced along the @entity3 - @entity4 crossing , and to ensure that the nations ' respective armies are unable to reestablish the border that was effectively wiped out by the terror group 's lightning advance last summer			1
other well - known militants still alive and operational include @entity137 , the terror group 's 28 - year - old leader in @entity4 's @entity140 ( right ) , @entity141 , another 28 - year - old , who is understood to be responsible for @entity17 ' military operations within @entity3 @entity146 's distinctive thick black beard has ensured he has been used prominently in @entity17 propaganda while many local tribal leaders are in favour of a @entity154 caliphate , their allegiances remain largely tribal and they are not seen as entrenched supporters of @entity17 ( pictured ) @entity23 is likely to have replaced @entity126 with another of his trusted lieutenants , but in less strategically important regions he is understood to have been forced to appoint local warlords to the role of senior commander as his inner circle of loyalists dwindles			1
while many of these local tribal leaders are in favour of a @entity154 caliphate and their opposition to the @entity3 and @entity4 regimes confirmed , their allegiances remain largely tribal and they are not seen as entrenched supporters of the @entity23 - led group			0
long - standing tensions between the tribes has also surfaced as they battle for regional prominence and advantage , causing chaos with @entity17 ranks			0
despite the serious damage done to @entity17 ' leadership by the airstrikes , scores of prominent militants remain alive , including the terror group 's @entity13 executioner in chief , @entity97			1
although he is unlikely to hold a senior position within the group 's leadership , his death would be highly symbolic in the battle to defeat @entity17 due to his in the deaths of @entity13 , @entity192 and @entity193 aid workers and journalists			0
over the weekend @entity17 ' @entity13 executioner in chief , @entity97 , savagely murdered @entity193 journalist @entity197 in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations through intermediaries to save him mr @entity197 joined a list of other victims , including fellow @entity193 national @entity203 ( left )			2
@entity13 aid workers @entity206 ( centre ) , and @entity208 ( right ) have also been murdered @entity192 journalist @entity209 ( left ) was the first to appear alongside @entity97 in one of the sickening videos , followed by @entity212 ( centre			0
aid worker @entity214 ( right ) is also dead other well - known militants still alive and operational include @entity137 , the terror group 's 28 - year - old leader in @entity4 's @entity140 province , whose distinctive thick black beard has ensured he has been used prominently in @entity17 propaganda			1
another is @entity141 , another 28 - year - old , who is understood to be responsible for @entity17 ' military operations within @entity3			0
before joining @entity223 - born @entity141 led the terror group @entity224 in operations against the @entity3 regime , but declared his allegiance to @entity23 last year			0
he had previously been a member of the @entity229 army , but left ahead of his promotion to officer .			0

@entity10 airstrikes decimate @entity17 ' leadership , leaving terror group in chaos
terror chief @entity8 left isolated and in hiding amid chaos
nine out the 18 members of @entity23 's ruling council have been killed
these include number two @entity19 , who had previously served as a lieutenant colonel in @entity44 's @entity4 army
but prominent killers such as @entity97 are still free to commit *atrocities*
