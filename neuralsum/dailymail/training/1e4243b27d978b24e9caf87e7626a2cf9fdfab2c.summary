@entity8 , 47 , gave her kidney to an elderly man in the @entity11 , her eggs to a childless couple in @entity14 , and part of her liver to a 12 - year - old in the @entity17			1
now the mother - of - one is trying to give away her lung , and insists husband @entity20 , 51 , and 19 - year - old son @entity21 support her all the way			1
@entity23 , 47 , has given away her kidney , eggs and part of her liver and is now trying to donate a lung despite risking infection , bleeding , blood clots and death , mrs @entity8 insists husband @entity20 , 51 ( pictured ) , and 19 - year - old son @entity21 stand behind her decisions her obsession with organ donation began in 2001 when she posted an advert online offering to give away a kidney in return for travel and living expenses			1
the ad read : ' free kidney , no strings attached			2
' mrs @entity8 's first donation was to @entity11 @entity42 ( pictured ) who was dying of a genetic kidney disease @entity42 , from the @entity11 , replied			1
the 60 - year - old said he was dying from a genetic kidney disorder , was already on dialysis , and that time was running out			2
after establishing that she was a match , @entity8 flew to the @entity11 for the operation			2
she told the @entity50 : ' you do n't need two kidneys , a lot of people are born with only one			0
why not give one to someone who needs it ? ' mr @entity42 , from @entity58 , had to fly to @entity59 with mrs @entity8 for the operation after surgeons in his home state refused to carry out the procedure			2
but following the operation mr @entity42 is now 73 and living an active life			0
after hearing about the generous kidney donation , a childless couple in @entity14 got hold of mrs @entity8 to ask if she would consider donating some eggs to them for @entity72 treatment			1
she donated 27 eggs , and managed to find out that three had been fertilised before losing touch with the couple			1
to this day she has no idea if the pair ever managed to have children using her eggs			0
mrs @entity8 was forced to go abroad to make all of her donations as altruistic donation was illegal in the @entity17 until 2006 amid fears that people could be coerced into giving			2
mrs @entity8 ( front left ) travelled to @entity59 in the @entity11 to donate the kidney			1
mr @entity42 ( right , in bed ) is now 73 and living a healthy and active life in december last year mrs @entity8 ( in bed ) donated part of her liver to a 12 - year - old in the @entity17 ( pictured at @entity92 alongside husband @entity20 ) but after the law changed mrs @entity8 contacted the @entity94 , saying she wanted to donate a part of her liver			1
in december last year @entity96 got in touch to say they had a little boy close to death who was in need of a liver			1
she added : ' i do n't know who he is but he 's doing well and started nursery in april			0
' mrs @entity8 says she donates to give other people a chance at life , but by undergoing so many surgeries , she is risking her own altruistic organ donation used to be illegal in the @entity17 until 2006 , as it was feared that donors could be forced into donating or do it for money			1
but now increasing numbers of altruistic donors - meaning donors from outside the immediate family of the patient - are coming forward to give away their organs			1
living donation is major surgery , and comes with all the risks associated with any other operation - including infection , bleeding , blood clots and death			0
some operations are riskier than others			0
living kidney donations are relatively safe , with donors having a 1 in 3,000 chance of dying from the surgery			0
common complications include protein in urine and high blood pressure			0
however for liver donation , the risks are much greater			0
donors can suffer abdominal bleeding , bile leakage , bowel obstructions and kidney failure			0
for lung patients , the risks are higher still			0
surgery can cause a fistula - a type of abscess - between the lung and its outer wall which can lead to air leaking out			2
another potential risk is ventricular fibrillation arrest , a type of cardiac arrest , which can lead to sudden death .			0
