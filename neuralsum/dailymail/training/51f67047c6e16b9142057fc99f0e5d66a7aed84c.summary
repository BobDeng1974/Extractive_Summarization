' love nest ? @entity3 's lawyer claims that @entity4 lied to @entity1 by telling him they were divorced			1
why would she be so cruel , the lawyer asked in court papers			1
' perhaps the younger gentleman that is staying at the @entity20 house ... could answer that question for us , ' he wrote room with a view : when a maid answered the door at @entity1 's condo , she confirmed to @entity17 that a man named @entity92 is living there the cheating accusation is the latest in a seven - year battle between @entity53 , 60 , @entity1 ’s second wife , and @entity3 and @entity97 - his daughters from his first marriage - over how to manage his deteriorating health			1

' @entity4 has caused and incredible amount of pain and damage to the @entity1 family			2

vows : @entity1 married @entity4 , a statuesque actress in 1980 , a year after his divorce from first wife			1

@entity4 did n’t even get a proper hospital bed for him			0
that ’s why he ended up with bedsores			0
' @entity3 and @entity97 were concerned about their father and wanted to see him because they knew about @entity4 ’s terrible record of caring for him - they knew their dad was being horribly neglected			1
' but @entity4 said in a june 9 court declaration : ' i have spared no expense to ensure that @entity1 receives state - of - the - art medical treatment and 24 - hour - a - day care			1

' happier times : court papers reveal how @entity1 's three children from his previous marriage , @entity3 , @entity211 and @entity97 were on good terms with @entity4 until his health deteriorated			1
but for seven years they have been fighting over who cares for him with @entity4 claiming they showed ' disturbing ' behavior and want to secure his $ 80m this snub to @entity4 came back to haunt the @entity1 family six years later with nasty court battles and accusations from @entity1 ’s older kids that as his health went steadily downhill , @entity4 was shutting them out of his life			1
on june 11 , a @entity63 judge , upheld @entity1 ’s 2007 wishes , giving @entity3 the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water , food and medicine after hearing from doctors that continuing nutrition would ' at best prolong the dying process for him and will certainly add suffering to an already uncomfortable dying process			1
' the court ’s decision was condemned by @entity4 ’s @entity63 attorney , @entity238 , who called it ' the functional equivalent of a death sentence			2
' @entity238 claimed that @entity3 ’s real concern over her father is that she wants to profit from her father ’s death			2

instead he gave @entity3 and her two siblings and @entity152 a $ 2 million insurance policy			0
' the kids did not come around from 2007 when they were cut off			0
they showed up in 2013 when they heard @entity1 was dying - a final , desperate effort to hook into his $ 80 million estate			2
@entity3 , along with her @entity253 friends , picketed in front of @entity4 ’s house , @entity4 received death threats , someone went though their trash			2
' @entity3 , not surprisingly , completely denied these claims in the same @entity248 article			0
' absolute lies , ' she ranted			0
' this will be part of my defamation suit			0
i never took loans from my dad and he never cut me off			0
we have an irrevocable trust that was set up 30 years ago			0
' i have never gone a week without either seeing my dad or talking to him on the phone until @entity4 blocked me , my brother ( @entity279 ) and my sister @entity97			0
