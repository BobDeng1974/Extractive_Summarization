by @entity0 demanding a correction : @entity2 , 15 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , has taken on @entity5 over the use of a slogan used in a recent advert a schoolboy who forced @entity10 to change the wording on its orange juice cartons because of a grammatical error has now taken on @entity5 to challenge a slogan used in an advert			1
@entity2 , 15 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , has been engaged in a month - long email exchange with the motoring firm in a bid to alter a phrase in the new clip promoting the @entity21			1
the advert , which was shown during a recent trip to the cinema with his family , ends with the slogan : ' it bites as bad as it barks '			1
@entity5 staff say it is a play on words but the schoolboy insists the slogan should be corrected - because bad is not an adverb			1
it follows a complaint he made to the supermarket giants in march			2
he sparked a major rebrand after questioning their use of the phrase ‘ most tastiest ’ , rather than ‘ tastiest ’ or ‘ most tasty ' on the packaging of @entity10 - brand juice			2
on may 19 @entity2 sent his first complaint to @entity5 via their website			1
a customer service executive from the company responded two weeks later , saying they appreciated feedback and promised they would look into the matter			2
the email also stated that the firm ' understood ' @entity2 's frustration ' especially as it distracted his cinematic experience			1
' @entity2 , who has now been informed the advert will not be changed despite his plea , told @entity60 : ' i can understand that they want to use short and snappy slogans in their campaigns , but a company like @entity5 should at least come up with something that is accurate			1
' i was at the cinema with my family a few weeks ago to watch @entity69 and i noticed the trailer for the new 2 series			2
' i was frustrated because " bad " is not an adverb - as any semi-literate eight year old could tell you			1
' a couple of weeks after i contacted them , i got fed up of waiting for them , so i emailed them again			2
' ' i also tried to get in contact with someone in the advertising department - but all they said was they had logged my complaint			2
' this is the first time i have seen or heard of anything like this on the site			2
' @entity2 is currently studying for his gcses and is preparing for his last exam on friday - further maths			1
the timing is frustrating for the schoolboy because the crucial test is the day after his school prom			0
spotting the mistake : @entity2 , pictured when he challenged @entity10 over the use of a phrase on a juice carton , said his strict attitude towards grammar comes from his parents next year he is starting at a sixth form college and has his sights on a career in medicine			1
he added : ' i would like to go to a top university			0
obviously i would love to go somewhere like @entity128 or @entity129 , but have not decided yet			0
' i have had about 20 exams so far and am predicted to an get a * in almost all of them			0
' @entity2 believes his stringent attitude towards grammar comes from his parents			1
he even flags up mistakes in his classmates ' work			0
' my friends sometimes get frustrated when i look at their work , but some of them find it funny , ' he said			0
standing firm : a customer services representative from @entity5 said they had logged @entity2 's complaint , but were not going to change the wording used in the advert @entity2 's battle with @entity5 over their use of bad grammar follows a clash with @entity10 over the wording on their juice cartons the email exchange between @entity2 and @entity95 , a @entity96 , began on may 19			1
may 19 ( written in query box on the @entity5 website ) @entity2 : ' i was at the cinema recently , watching @entity69 , when i saw an advert for the new @entity162			1
but the whole advert was ruined by the slogan “ it bites as bad as it barks ”			1
this is grammatically incorrect , as ‘ bad ’ is not an adverb , so can not be used in this context			2
' the word “ badly ” would be acceptable or even more exciting alternatives like ' fiercely '			0
it would also be correct to say “ its bite is as bad as its bark ”			2
i was distracted with it throughout @entity69 , and did n’t enjoy it fully			0
' may 22 ( email in reply ) dear mr @entity2 thank you for your online enquiry dated may 19 , 2014			1
i am sorry to learn of your disappointment in relation to the phrasing which featured in the advertisement for the @entity162			0
i can certainly understand your frustration , especially as it caused you distraction throughout your cinematic experience			0
we welcome customer feedback and i appreciate you taking the time to contact us			0
i can confirm that i have forwarded your email to our @entity189 , who will assess your dissatisfaction in due course			0
a response will be sent to you in the next few days			0
once again , i apologise for any inconvenience this has caused			0
i would like to assure you that your comments have been duly reordered with us , under the case reference number 1 - 18618938273			2
please feel free to contact me , should you require any further assistance			0
yours sincerely @entity5 @entity200 @entity95 @entity96 june 3 ( email from @entity2 ) hello , i would like to point out that a response was promised to me regarding my grammar issue , and it has been a few days , under any definition of the phrase ' a few ' , as the email was sent on the 22nd of may and it is now the 3rd of june			1
the reference number for my comments is 1 - 18618938273 if that helps quicken the process			2
june 5 ( second response justifying the use of the phrase ) dear mr @entity2 thank you for your further email dated june 3 , 2014			1
i am sorry to learn of your continued disappointment in relation to the phrasing which featured in the advertisement for the @entity162			0
the advertisement for the @entity21 is supported by the strap line , ' bites as bad as it barks '			1
the way that this line is presented is deliberate as it draws its intelligence from playing on the well known phrase and duality of this being a @entity5 with an edge			1
during the advertisement you will hear the bark and so the ‘ promise ’ is what you would expect from such a bark which is the bite			0
i thank you once again for providing us with your feedback			0
i trust that the information provided , clarifies our decision on the advertisement			0
yours sincerely @entity5 @entity200 @entity95 june 5 dear mr @entity95 , thank you for your response			1
it did indeed clarify why you chose the slogan , but i had already decoded the very intelligent reference to a well - known phrase			1
i would , however , like to point out that it is still grammatically incorrect			0
the phrase you are referring to is ' its bark is worse than its bite ' , or ' it barks worse than it bites ' in a few cases			1
i have never heard the word ' bad ' used in this particular saying , but if it were , it would look something like ' its bark is more bad than its bark ' or ' it barks more badly than it bites ' ( as you can see , these are hardly correct			1
) in no well - known saying is ' bad ' used as an adverb			1
you can look it up in a dictionary if you like , and it will describe it as an @entity266 ( and maybe even a noun ) , which it is			0
if the strap line draws its intelligence from the incorrect grammar using ' bad ' as an adverb , in a ' promise ' to viewers regarding the literacy rates at the @entity5 marketing department , i would of course have no quarrel with anything			1
my kindest regards , @entity2 june 9 dear mr @entity2 thank you for your further email dated june 5 , 2014			1
once again , i am sorry to learn that the phrasing which featured in the advertisement for the @entity162 , has caused you continued disappointment			0
i would like to assure you that your comments have been duly recorded under the case reference 1 - 18618938273			2
my colleagues in our advertising department have also been made fully aware of your correspondence			0
i apologise that you have had reason to write to us under such circumstances			0
your continued frustration is acknowledged , however , i believe that i have researched your concerns thoroughly and can not provide any additional information			0
yours sincerely @entity5 @entity200 @entity95 june 9 dear mr @entity95 , by ' researched ' i hope you mean that you have realised that the phrase is incorrect and it is imperative that it is changed			2
i hope your colleagues change the advertisement in the near future			0
thank you for your continued helpfulness throughout this matter			0
