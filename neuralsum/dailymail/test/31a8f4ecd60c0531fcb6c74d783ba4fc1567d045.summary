ahead of the 79th edition of the masters , @entity0 counts down the 20 greatest shots ever seen at @entity4			1
here are @entity5 20 - 11			2
@entity6 celebrates his winning putt in 1998 20 @entity6 , 1998 aged 41 , @entity6 's chances of a major championship appeared to have gone despite a fine career and many victories on the @entity12			2
but @entity6 shot two birdies in three holes from the 15th on sunday and a good approach into the 18th left him with a 20 - footer to beat @entity18 and @entity19			2
in the manner of his great friend @entity21 , he drained it			1
and he was soon handed his green jacket by @entity21 in the @entity24			1
click here to watch the video 19 @entity27 , 1954 @entity27 came within a stroke of perhaps the biggest masters shock of all but narrowly missed out on a play - off with @entity32 and @entity33			2
but for a short while it had appeared that an amateur golfer could topple two of the greatest ever to play the game , thanks to his hole - in - one on the par - three sixth on sunday			0
sadly , @entity27 's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly @entity42 and reach the green in two			0
otherwise his ace would have featured near the very top of this list			0
@entity27 hits on the 13th hole ... the scene of the double - bogey which ultimately cost him victory click here for the second part of our countdown , featuring videos of shots from the likes of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity21 ... 18 @entity59 , 1983 @entity59 's second @entity61 victory featured what he called ' the best golf of my life ' over the first four holes , and one 205 - yard 2 - iron on the fourth was utterly spectacular			1
but nothing quite sums up the genius of the late , great spaniard than the way he clinched his four - shot victory over @entity72 and @entity73			0
an up and down for a bogey would have comfortably sewn up his victory , but showman @entity59 was having none of it and chipped in for a par four			1
17 @entity78 , 1937 @entity78 found himself a somewhat daunting six shots behind @entity80 in the final round of the 1937 tournament			1
but his comeback was complete on the par - five 13th after he found the cup with a chip for eagle from off the green , while his rival could only manage bogey			0
@entity90 came from four strokes down to two ahead in just 25 minutes , and went on to win the first of his five majors by that same margin			0
@entity78 and club member @entity95 at the presentation ceremony in 1937 16 @entity97 , 2009 ok , so this is n't actually during the masters itself , but have you ever seen anything like it ? the big @entity104 won the green jacket in 2000 but may not have hit a finer shot than this one during the annual par - three tournament on the wednesday before the 2009 edition			0
@entity97 skimmed his ball across a lake and watched as it rolled onto the green and into the cup for an ace			0
you 'll need to see it to believe it			0
15 @entity117 , 1989 with dark descending , in dank drizzle and with wind whipping the course , @entity117 became only the second @entity122 ever to win the masters after a play - off with @entity125			1
his nerveless approach over the water on the 11th hole was good , but the putt was even better			0
@entity117 recalled how his caddie , @entity130 , told him it was too dark to see the line of the shot , but he stroked it pure and right into the heart of the cup			1

after missing the first green , the @entity148 somehow chipped in from 100 feet for a remarkable birdie			0
and then , on the third , he slam - dunked his approach from the fairway for an eagle two			0
two incredible shots , but the gods truly were smiling on @entity142 that day			2
click here to watch the video @entity142 ( right ) is presented with his green jacket by @entity160 in 2011 13 @entity160 , 2004 @entity160 had long carried the burden of being known as ' the best player never to have won a major ' - just ask @entity163 how wearisome that feels			1
@entity160 had a string of near - misses behind him - six second and third places - when he went toe - to - toe with @entity168 over the back nine at @entity4 that sunday			1
and it all came down to the final green as @entity160 the @entity171 sank an 18 - footer for birdie under huge pressure to cast off that unwanted reputation once and for all			1
12 @entity176 , 1979 imagine playing in your very first masters ... and standing over a putt to win , in a sudden - death play - off			0
it was the first time the @entity61 had been decided in such a way , was played in the gathering gloom and also included @entity183 and the great @entity184			1
in near darkness , @entity176 held his nerve to sink his birdie putt on the 11th hole and make history			2
11 @entity190 , 2012 some might argue that this is the best shot in masters history - but some would also say it was n't even the best shot of the day ( see the countdown from 10 - 1 )			2
whatever , it 's hard to think of a more perfectly envisioned , controlled and executed long iron in the history of the game			2
@entity190 catapulted himself into the lead ( and an eventual play - off ) with this 253 - yard approach into the par - five second hole that pitched on a sixpence at the front of the green			0
from then on , it was never going anywhere other than the centre of the cup			0
@entity190 raises his arms and soaks it all in after holing out for an albatross at @entity4 in 2012			1

the 79th @entity61 begins on *thursday* at @entity4
@entity21 and @entity216 are among the leading contenders
