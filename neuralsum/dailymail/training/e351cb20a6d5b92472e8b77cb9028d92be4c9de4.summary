@entity5 wanted to combine his love of comics with an unfulfilled desire to get a tattoo			1
the perfect opportunity arose when the 30 - year - old from @entity12 saw a coupon deal for a cut - price inking			1
thankfully , @entity5 is a comic book artist so is able to fill in the strip several times a day			2
mr @entity5 said : ' about a year ago i was on groupon.com and i saw that there was a deal for a $ 150 tattoo for $ 50			1
mostly i bought it because i have wanted a tattoo for over a decade but could never commit to a design			2
@entity5 wanted to combine his love of comics with an unfulfilled desire to get a tattoo @entity5 saw a coupon deal for cut - price inking and decided to get a blank comic strip which he can fill in after buying the coupon deal , mr @entity38 and his wife started brainstorming designs ' i am too picky with my art and being married to one single design on my body was always a tough decision			1

' i knew that i wanted to honour my love for comic art ' , he said			0
' originally i thought of ideas like getting an onomatopoeia , or even one of my favourite characters - but all of those would cost more than the original $ 50 base price of the tattoo			2
fifty dollars equals one hour worth of tattooing			0
' when we both came up with the idea it was like lightning and made so much sense that it seemed obvious			0
the comic strip is on mr @entity38 's left forearm mainly because he is right handed although he says he can draw with both thankfully , @entity5 is a comic book artist so is able to fill in the strip several times a day with the coupon offer about to expire , mr @entity5 found himself getting four blank panels tattooed on his left forearm quirky : @entity5 has had blank comic strip panels tattooed on his arm so he can fill them in daily after buying the coupon deal , mr @entity38 and his wife started brainstorming designs for his tattoo which turned out to be a blank tattoo strip which he fills in every day ' i decided on a four panel format as an homage to @entity82 , author of the comic strip @entity83			1

' i do draw them myself ' , he said			0
' sometimes i get in one or two a day and sometimes i just do n't have enough time to finish them and i wait for a really great idea			0
@entity5 holds in his arm to show one of his creations on his tattooed arm dedicated : mr @entity5 sits at his desk with his pens creating a new design on his tattooed arm ' at the very base of this project is a simple design that is made to help me loosen my creative juices , if only for 10 - 15 minutes a day , as 10 - 15 minutes is how long it takes me to draw them			1
' having a simple exercise like to pre-formatted tattoo on my arm really is about having fun with art and not thinking too much			0
' i do take the comic seriously though			0
my ultimate dream with the whole project is to generate a couple hundred strips and take the 50 best and make them into a high quality picture book			0
