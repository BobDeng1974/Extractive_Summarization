it is just a coincidence that @entity3 - crested gilets in the official merchandise shop by the club ’s grand stadium are on offer , reduced from £ 42 to £ 29			1
a happy coincidence , though			2
the knockdown price was implemented as winter took hold , before @entity11 rolled into town			1
they have been selling well			2
the rail , bare on sunday evening , has been replenished with the final six in stock – four small sizes and two extra-large			2
it is unclear whether @entity11 ’s arrival had a similar uplift to gilet sales as it did the team ’s performance after half - time against @entity25			1
to coincide with @entity11 's sppointment @entity3 gilets have gone on sale in the club store the price on the sleeveless jackets has been reduced from £ 42 to £ 29 former @entity31 manager @entity11 was unveiled as @entity3 manager on monday whatever , should he request the garment he made somewhat famous over five months in charge at @entity31 , he may have to wait a little			1
he walked into the press conference room in the @entity36 wearing a suit , v - neck jumper , and the confidence needed in such a precarious situation			2
a mention was immediately made of that missing bit of warm clothing			0
‘ f * * * * * * hell , i thought it would be two seconds before i heard a gilet joke , ’ he said			2
‘ it was one ! ’ more is needed than a well - timed comic quip in @entity3 ’s current plight of course , but @entity11 ’s words brought a breath of fresh air to a place that has developed a stale odour			1
he was alert and direct , never far from allowing a drop of humour to enter proceedings			0
‘ @entity61 ’ , was a word uttered more than once			0
the 47 - year - old was already batting off comments about his gilet at the first press conference @entity11 gave his new players a half - time team talk during @entity69 fifth - round win over @entity25 on sunday that is what his new players can expect			1
straight - talking criticism aimed at provoking an immediate upturn in performances and also education for lasting improvement			0
@entity77 aims to speak of , harder to implement in practice			0
listening to @entity11 for nearly an hour , though , it is clear @entity3 have acted correctly in jettisoning @entity80 and bringing in the former @entity31 head coach			1
whether he does indeed keep @entity3 safe from relegation remains to be seen			1
a change was undoubtedly required			0
@entity11 was clear that he needs to provide a short , sharp shock straight away to keep @entity3 up			1
beyond that point , he wants to work with young talents – as long as the club academy has them – and bring more through to the first - team			2
@entity11 was in good form as he faced the media for the first time on monday @entity11 arrived bright and early at @entity36 on monday morning for his unveiling of the here and now , @entity11 said : ‘ i ’ve got a way i like to work , it has been a success albeit a short period			1
i know how to win games in this league			0
i know how to galvanise players , get the best out of them , that is what i will do here			0
’ @entity11 remains the @entity31 manager with the best @entity106 win ratio ( 59 per cent ) but still some question his appointment on terms of experience			1
he had a decent answer here too			0
‘ there are a lot of poor experienced managers , ’ he said plainly			0
‘ a lot of good ones too			0
i think it ’s overrated to be honest			0
’ there was that word again			0
@entity11 adopted the claret and blue scarf for his promotional shots in the stands at @entity36 , beneath a cloudy sky that seemed apt for the club ’s predicament			1
at the same time a scattering of customers perused the shop across the road , searching for value			0
if @entity11 manages to keep @entity3 in the @entity106 , he will be viewed as the best bargain of the year .			1
