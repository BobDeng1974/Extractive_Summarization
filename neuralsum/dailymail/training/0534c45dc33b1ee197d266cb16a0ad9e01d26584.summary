@entity1 ’s fall - out with his @entity3 side @entity4 just one truncated season into a four - year contract is being blamed in @entity7 on his formidable mother @entity8			1
@entity1 is expected to return to the @entity10 with @entity11 in the january window , as manager @entity13 indicated on thursday , provided terms can be agreed			1
and @entity4 have briefed local media that @entity8 is heavily responsible for ‘ mama ’s boy ’ @entity1 leaving so prematurely			1
@entity1 could link back up with @entity11 manager @entity13 the @entity4 forward scored 11 goals for the @entity7 outfit during the 2014 season @entity1 ( pictured with sister @entity21 , left ) has been influenced to leave @entity7 by his mum @entity8 ( right ) @entity4 chief @entity23 felt he had to seriously impress @entity8 to get her son to @entity7 in the first place			1
this included having rap star @entity28 and basketball great @entity27 make a fuss of her			2
and the multi-layered contract that @entity1 signed with @entity4 included luxury accommodation for his mum			1
now @entity23 says : ‘ we have to determine does @entity1 want to be here , but we ’re not going to give him away			1
’ the way the @entity39 have taken ownership of @entity41 ahead of the @entity44 v @entity43 match on sunday — with the media attending @entity48 ’s @entity47 squad announcement faced with no - entry signs everywhere — suggests they would take precedence over the national game if ever an @entity53 came to @entity54			1
@entity47 cricketer @entity55 has stayed quiet since being slated in @entity57 ’s book as the ‘ @entity58 ’ in the dressing room			1
but prior now appears to have subtly struck back by retweeting the newspaper headline : ‘ how @entity62 assistant coach @entity61 turned side around with no - d * * * heads policy			2
’ @entity47 cricketer @entity55 is yet to respond to @entity57 's dressing room claims the prawn - sandwich brigade have embraced the @entity67 to the extent £ 50million of corporate hospitality has been sold for the tournament with a year to go , including all @entity72 boxes for the 10 games there			1
the biggest task by far for the organisers is filling @entity78 ’s @entity77 , where eight matches are being held			2
the @entity81 rugby public are not used to paying for the high - price categories			2
@entity83 snubs @entity85 pal it ’s the talk of the @entity85 that @entity83 , football commentator on @entity87 and recently @entity88 , turned down an invitation to a special @entity85 farewell party for @entity91 in @entity92 this week			0
@entity91 , who was @entity83 ’s partner on big - match radio commentaries for nearly 30 years , retired after the @entity67			0
@entity83 also snubbed an @entity95 reception where a presentation was made to @entity91 in @entity97 ahead of the @entity67			0
he claimed he knew nothing about it but was seated just outside the hotel function room ahead of the bash			0
meanwhile @entity103 , without an @entity102 drive next year , could end up as a @entity105 pundit with @entity106 keen on a reduced workload			0
@entity85 commentator @entity83 turned down an invitation to attend a leaving party for @entity91 sir @entity110 , ex-chairman of the @entity10 and yet to be properly replaced since his retirement in 2012 , has been helping former @entity95 board colleague @entity113 search for a buyer for debt - ridden @entity115			0
this included a trip to @entity119 , where @entity120 introduced @entity121 to potential investors			0
@entity123 chairman sir @entity110 has been helping @entity113 find a buyer for @entity115 @entity47 kick off their third rugby game of the autumn series against @entity127 on saturday , november 22 at 7pm , partly as a dress rehearsal for @entity67 night matches			1
however , the tournament opens with a friday night game at @entity72 when commuter traffic will be a major problem			0
@entity134 2015 have started their @entity137 - style transport and opening ceremony planning but did n’t want to impact too much on the autumn series with a friday game			0
the most notable aspect of the extra £ 1.18m being given to @entity142 basketball , brokered by @entity144 @entity143 to allow them to compete in tournaments , is that the cash is coming from @entity47 ’s grass - roots budget			2
@entity149 are only providing technical support so their snubbing of sports — including basketball — with no medal potential at @entity154 is not compromised ahead of a consultation exercise into the flawed policy			0
minister for sport @entity143 has decided to hand @entity142 basketball an extra £ 1.18m			0

former @entity159 ace @entity1 could return to @entity47 in january
