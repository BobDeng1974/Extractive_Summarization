mr @entity1 was not released until the arrival of another officer whom @entity28 told : ' i think i ’ve got the wrong person			1
' @entity31 held a two - day disciplinary hearing following a recommendation from the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct			2
the meeting concluded @entity28 was not guilty of ' gross incompetence ' - but should be issued with a performance improvement notice and that he be told to apologise personally to mr @entity1			1
mr @entity1 condemned the decision today			1
he said : ' this officer broke a rule , he should never have shot a blind man in the back from 6ft away			1
there was no urgency for him to pull the trigger - i could very easily have been dead			2
' ' the odds have not been in my favour			0
since it happened i have been diagnosed with traumatic stress disorder because if what has been going on			0
' before it happened i had only been out of hospital five months after having a brain haemorrhage and stroke , my brain had n't even had chance to recover and then this			0
let 's just say i 'm happy that at least he wo n't be getting a promotion			0
' he can live with his conscience , but i did nothing wrong , i 'm the innocent victim			0
if he can shoot a blind man and get away with it what signal is that giving out to people			2
' it was n't a mistake , he pulled that trigger on purpose , he could have waited			0
i have lost faith in the police , i have had no justice			0
if it can get to this then god help anybody			0
' these trigger happy police officers are killing people , if i had a pacemaker i would be dead by now			2
i do n't want an apology because it 's an insult to me			0
it seems like he has treated like a naughty schoolboy when i believe it was total negligence on his part			0
' an investigation by the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) was launched after the incident in october 2012			2
it discovered the man was walking away from @entity28 at the time and posed no threat			0
@entity16 police found that although pc @entity17 failed to perform his duties to a satisfactory standard , his actions did not amount to gross incompetence			1
he has been asked to apologise to the man @entity103 of @entity104 where @entity1 was tasered			2
the officer thought the man 's white stick was a sword - so shot him with the device before handcuffing him on the floor a report from the police watchdog found @entity28 failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain if mr @entity1 was carrying a sword before he discharged the taser			1
he had used a level of force that was ' unnecessary and disproportionate to the circumstances ' and caused further distress to mr @entity1 by detaining him in handcuffs despite it being ' obvious ' he had the wrong man , it added			1
@entity28 also ignored instructions and radio transmissions about how to deal with the incident , and failed to comply with local and national guidelines on the use of @entity115			0
@entity34 commissioner @entity129 said : ' mr @entity1 was subjected to what must have been a terrifying ordeal			2
' our view was that @entity134 could and should have listened to instructions from his force controller and taken greater steps to ascertain whether mr @entity1 was the sword - carrying man that had been reported by members of the public and when he realised his mistake should have acted quicker to put things right			1
' there is public concern about use of force , and , particularly , @entity115			0
incidents such as this do little to ease that concern			0
mr @entity1 thought he was having a stroke when he was hit by the device , one pictured ' i hope that the personal apology to mr @entity1 allows the officer to reassure him that he will learn lessons from these events and that the improvement plan for the officer and measures taken by the force to improve its training and communications prevent further incidents such as this			1
' in a statement , @entity31 said : ' the officer was dealt with under @entity167 of the @entity168 by a panel made up of assistant chief constable @entity170 , chief supt @entity171 and mr @entity172 , the @entity173			0
' the panel found that the officer failed to perform his duties to a satisfactory standard on october 12 , 2012 , though his actions did not amount to gross incompetence			1
@entity179 @entity17 had been called out on patrol following reports someone was in the town centre with a samurai sword , one example pictured ' the officer will be issued with a @entity186 and be required to demonstrate specific performance improvements over a set timescale			1
additionally , the officer has expressed considerable regret over this incident and arrangements will be made for him to offer a personal apology to mr @entity1			1
' tasers were introduced to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons and @entity199 have been discharged in more than 6,200 confrontations across @entity201 and @entity202 since they were introduced in @entity203 use a @entity204 manufactured £ 500 @entity206 model which fires a 50,000 - volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal @entity211 has a range of 21ft and causes muscles to twitch uncontrollably mr @entity170 added : ' first and foremost i would like to sincerely apologise to mr @entity1 on behalf of the constabulary for what happened that evening and the resulting distress and anxiety he undoubtedly suffered			1
' the officer made a dreadful mistake when he discharged his taser , but was acting on a reasonable and honestly held belief that his actions were necessary to protect the public			0
the officer did not perform his duties to a satisfactory standard but we did not feel that this amounted to gross incompetence			2
' in addition to the findings relating to the individual officer this investigation has raised a number of issues for the constabulary to consider including the training given to officers carrying @entity115			0
” last year , mr @entity1 's lawyers said they had lodged a civil claim at the @entity241 for damages on grounds of assault and battery , false imprisonment and suffering inhumane and degrading treatment			1
