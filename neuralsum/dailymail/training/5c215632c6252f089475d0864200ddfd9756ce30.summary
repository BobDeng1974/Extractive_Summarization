by @entity0 with the @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity5 's time in @entity6 well behind us , it 's time to muse on @entity3 's impeccable @entity9 wardrobe and celebrate her evolving style from girl - next - door to a very modern - and stylish - princess			1
now one of the most famous women in the world , the last three years have been a time of huge change for the former @entity3 - so could it all be down to one lady ? introducing @entity20			1
@entity20 - or @entity21 as she is fondly known within the royal circle - has been helping @entity3 remodel her style			1
who 's that girl ? @entity20 - or ' @entity21 ' as she is fondly known within the royal circle - is described as a @entity27 but has reportedly been helping revamp the duchess of @entity5 's wardrobe @entity20 , also described as a ' @entity27 ' , was part of @entity3 ’s close entourage on tour and , according to @entity33 , has been helping @entity3 , 32 , look more ' regal ' as per the @entity35 's request			1
@entity20 first caught the world 's attention last july when she was one of the only people - aside from the royal family - seen entering the @entity40 after the birth of @entity42			1
the @entity27 , who studied hispanic studies at @entity45 , was seen carrying a dress bag and baby car seat , leading the world to question whether she hand - picked the now iconic blue and white polkadot dress that @entity3 stepped out in			1
she was also spotted landing in @entity50 , @entity51 with @entity3 ’s hairdresser , @entity52 , as the royal family embarked on the first leg of their tour last fortnight			1
part of the crew : the @entity2 and @entity3 attended a rugby union match in @entity6 on saturday and @entity20 was by @entity3 's side close confidante : the source revealed that @entity20 and @entity3 get on very well and the @entity27 has reportedly always supported and advised @entity3 @entity20 has reportedly been helping @entity3 with her outfit choices since last summer			1
a source told the fashion magazine : ' @entity20 ’s main role is as a @entity27 , but over the last few months she has assisted @entity3 as a style adviser			1
' @entity20 and @entity3 get on very well			1
she has always supported and advised @entity3 - and the @entity3 loves @entity20 ’s style , so it seemed like an obvious appointment			1
@entity20 has been helping @entity3 pick outfits for the tour			1
’ the source also added that @entity20 orders lots of clothes - particularly from @entity76 and @entity77 - online for @entity3			1
@entity78 entourage : @entity20 , second from front , was seen carrying clothes as she arrived at @entity82 on april 7 at the start of the @entity9 first spot : @entity20 was seen last july entering @entity40 after the birth of @entity42 with @entity3 's hairdresser , @entity52 , right and it seems that with @entity20 's advice , @entity3 , who has worn outfits by the likes of @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 throughout the tour of @entity99 and @entity51 , has dressed to impress			1
@entity99 's top fashion designers have heaped huge praise on the duchess of @entity5 's royal tour wardrobe - despite her snubbing all but one of them			2
classic designer @entity105 - who has met the @entity35 , prince @entity106 , @entity107 , prince @entity108 and @entity109 - applauded @entity3 's ' wonderful taste ' and the fact she was a ' hard working royal ' , as she attended a reception for the royal couple at @entity114 , @entity115			2
ms @entity105 even went so far as to label the 32 - year - old ' the best promotion of the fashion industry ' she can think of			0
royal dresser : @entity20 apparently helped select @entity3 's @entity9 outfits - like this elegant white @entity122 cocktail dress she wore on her last night in @entity6 dazzling @entity3 : @entity123 has worn dresses by the likes of @entity96 , left , and more high street options such as this @entity128 dress , right and it is n't just the designers praising @entity3 's style - it seems the general public love it , too			1
the ' @entity135 ' was in full force after the @entity3 stepped out in a @entity138 wrap dress for the second day of the royal couple 's visit to @entity99			2
@entity3 wore a £ 292 new season blue and white patterned wrap dress from the high - end designer to visit the @entity145 town of @entity146 , just outside of @entity6			2
the 31 - year - old is known for making fashion fly off the shelves as fans aim to emulate her style , but the blue and white wrap dress sold out at a particularly surprising speed of just eight minutes , according to fashion website @entity154			2
celebrity stylist , @entity155 , says she has it spot on : ' @entity3 's graduated from princess finishing school - no more student chic , she 's a " royal " - its official ! ' his wife may be better known as a style icon but it seems that prince @entity163 spent his time in @entity51 and @entity99 trailblazing a new trend - and he probably is n't even aware			1
while all eyes were on the @entity3 's dazzling dresses , her husband @entity163 was quietly championing the hottest new hipster trend : normcore			2
plain tees , comfortable shoes , understated anoraks and dad jeans are apparently no longer simply tolerated by the fashion community , they are applauded			0
@entity177 , it appears , is the new black and just blending in with the crowd a la prince @entity163 is totally en vogue			0
prince of style : @entity163 has been adhering to the ' normcore ' trend of scruffy trainers and chinos during his time in @entity51 - but is it just a coincidence ? a hybrid of the words ' normal ' and ' hardcore ' , @entity190 's @entity189 outlines the normcore rules			2
she writes : ' the normcore uniform is as follows : @entity197 sandals ( those foam - soled sandals with @entity198 patterned velcro straps ) ; @entity200 waterproof jackets ; @entity203 trainers ; white athletic socks ; boxy stonewash mum - cut jeans ; @entity207 roll - necks ; beige @entity208			0
' and it seems that @entity163 , 31 , has got the look spot on - save for his @entity212 trainers , which could be replaced by some on - trend all - black @entity203 or @entity213 - and voila : @entity163 normcore			0
catwalk worthy : @entity214 sent @entity215 ( left ) and @entity216 down his @entity218 runway in an understated look trendsetters : @entity215 ( left ) and @entity221 are firm fans of the normcore trend - a style @entity225 has been championing since she hit headlines @entity227 seems to have emerged as an offshoot of fashion 's love affair with all things nineties			2
@entity232 and @entity233 both created high fashion versions of @entity197 hiking sandals for spring 2014 , @entity76 is selling ' mum ' jeans and even @entity218 sent models , including @entity215 and @entity216 , who both embrace the trend in their downtime , down a supermarket aisle clad in sweatpants and sneakers			0
the result is that brand-less stonewash denim , nondescript zip - up tops and bulky white trainers have suddenly become cool , and lining shelves at stores from @entity251 and @entity252 to @entity253 and @entity77			0
even president @entity254 is being hailed as a style icon for the normcore set			0
normcore originals : @entity260 's @entity259 attire defines the emerging new trend for all things bland on the catwalk : a model looking normcore at @entity267 's spring / summer 2014 show last september ( left ) and @entity76 's ' @entity269 ' jeans in baby blue best foot forward : high - fashion interpretations of @entity197 hiking sandals were seen at the spring 2014 shows in september , including @entity232 ( left ) and @entity233 ( right ) fashion writer and blogger @entity275 is n't , however , convinced that @entity163 is on trend and his @entity51 wardrobe is just a coincidence			0
he said : ' " @entity227 " , " @entity282 tourist " , call it what you will , but really it 's nothing new			0
' this is the " trend " ( i use inverted commas because quite frankly i ca n't bring myself to call it something fashion noteworthy ) that a-listers like @entity290 have been trying to make cool for a long time			0
' by all means men , wear chinos with trainers and an @entity298 shirt , it can be a " cool " look , but i think in @entity163 's case it 's more accidental style than anything else ' ' do we actually think @entity163 wakes up in the morning , splashes some royal water over his face , looks into his wardrobe and says to himself : " how can i age myself by 40 years today ? " ' no. it 's more tradition with him than anything else			0
as next in line to the throne , and with his dad as his style icon , he needs to remain " vanilla "			0
' @entity312 pushes things a bit further by a ) wearing no clothes at all , and b ) actually looking good most of the time in what he does chose to put on			0
' by all means men , wear chinos with trainers and an @entity298 shirt , it can be a " cool " look , but i think in @entity163 's case it 's more accidental style than anything else			0
' and one hopes at least one half of this royal couple is actually buying new clothes rather than recycling them from years ago			0
' dressing like a dad : @entity327 is typical ' normcore ' as @entity328 in the 2011 rom com @entity330 , @entity331 , in which he co-stars with @entity332 president normcore : @entity254 pictured sporting his ' dad jeans ' on a family bike ride in @entity336 @entity337 , £ 40.00 , @entity76 , @entity338 with @entity339 and @entity340 , £ 50.00 @entity341 , £ 44.99 , @entity342 in @entity343 , £ 30.00 , @entity344 new balance 574 trainers , £ 65.00 , @entity77 , @entity346 , £ 22.00 , @entity77 @entity348 trainers , £ 100 , available may 1 from @entity349			0
