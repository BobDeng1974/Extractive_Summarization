the record profits driven by huge @entity1 6 sales have fed a £ 120billion cash pile , but like fellow giants @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity4 faces accusations over its tax bills in the @entity11 record profits , driven by the phenomenal sale of the latest @entity1 , saw @entity4 amass the cash pile which is larger than the total market value of @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity6			1
the news has reignited anger about the activities of @entity4 and other multi-national companies which stand accused of using complex schemes to minimise their tax bills			1
similar charges have been made against other @entity11 tech giants including @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity36 and @entity8			1
@entity4 yesterday revealed that its profits for just the past three months of 2014 were $ 18billion ( £ 11.9billion )			1
that figure put it ahead of the record set by the multi-national oil giant @entity40 in 2012 , which was being carried along on the tide of a surge in global oil prices at the time			2
in @entity4 ’s case , its success has been built on sales of latest @entity1 and 6plus , which has a larger screen			1
staggered : @entity4 's chief executive @entity49 and his staff can hardly believe their own success it sold a record 74.5 million iphones in the three months before @entity54 , which drove the company ’s revenues up by 30 per cent to $ 74.6 billion ( £ 49.2 billion )			1
@entity4 and its chief executive , @entity49 , said they were ‘ staggered ’ by the success of the @entity1 6 , which had achieved far higher sales than it or @entity62 experts had expected			1
the net effect is that @entity4 , which is the world ’s most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $ 650 billion ( £ 428.5 billion ) has so much money that it does not know what to do with it			2
the company uses a network of companies around the world , including an off - shoot in @entity73 , to minimise its tax bill in the @entity11 and the many countries in which it sells its devices			1
the @entity77 is so concerned that it has launched an investigation into a deal between @entity4 and the @entity73 government that ran from 1991 - 2007 , which effectively allowed the @entity11 giant to shrink its tax bill			1
if the inquiry finds the arrangement amounted to ‘ illegal state aid ’ , @entity4 could be required to hand over billions to make up for the tax shortfall			2
the huge popularity of @entity4 ’s products and its alleged manipulation of the tax system to its legal limits means it has been able to amass a huge cash fund , estimated at $ 178 billion ( £ 120bn )			1
if added together , the combined value of @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 only just surpass that of @entity4 ’s cash reserves			2
the cash mountain alone is equivalent to the entire annual economic output of oil - rich @entity100 and around three times more than countries such as @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			2
mr @entity49 and his executives are apparently reluctant to return the cash to the parent company in the @entity11 where it would be hit with a corporate tax rate of 35 per cent			1
consequently , @entity4 has been reduced to borrowing against this huge fund to raise cash to buy back shares in the company from shareholders at a premium price			1
@entity118 , tax campaign manager for the charity @entity120 , said it was time for the tech giant to come clean on its finances and tax payments			2
global : customers this week in the first @entity4 store to open in the capital of @entity129 's @entity128 ‘ the announcement by @entity4 today of the biggest profits in history is only part of the story			2
despite this news , corporate secrecy means we still do n’t know whether they ’re paying a fair share of tax , ’ he told @entity131			2
the @entity4 chief executive has rejected allegations of financial chicanery			2
mr @entity49 told a @entity11 @entity147 committee in 2013 : ‘ we pay all the taxes we owe , every single dollar			1
‘ we not only comply with the laws , but we comply with the spirit of the laws			0
we do n’t depend on tax gimmicks			2
we do n’t stash money on some @entity156 island			0
’ announcing the profit bonanza yesterday , mr @entity49 said : ‘ we ’d like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter , which saw demand for @entity4 products soar to an all - time high			0
’ @entity4 has been doing particularly well among the burgeoning middle classes in @entity129 , where it is now the country ’s number one smartphone brand			0
research firm @entity165 estimates that @entity4 sold more smartphones in @entity129 during the last quarter than any other country , including @entity11			1
the success of the @entity1 and 6 plus , which were launched last autumn , have to some extent cannibalised sales of its other devices			1
as a result , sales of @entity173 were down by 22 per cent to 21.4 million			2
devoted : customers queued for the @entity1 six outside stores all over the world , including this one in @entity178 some experts have suggested that the launch of the new @entity181 2 , @entity173 mini 3 and the lowering of the original ipad mini price to under £ 200 could see a return to growth for the @entity4 tablet			1
at the same time , the company is pinning expectations on the launch of its @entity189 , which is due to go on sale in april			0
the watch carries a raft of sensors which means it is as much an electronic health centre and automated fitness guru as an accessory to its smartphone			0
tech industry analysts an investment bank @entity200 suggested @entity4 is sitting on a raft of new gadgets that are expected to give even more fizz to its stellar sales			0
@entity206 , head of equities at @entity209 stockbrokers , said : ‘ one of the main drivers for the success was the company ’s increasing exposure to the @entity129 market , while there were also strong contributions from @entity218 and @entity219			0
’ figures that 'll make you dizzy 12bn is the profit @entity4 made in the past three months of 2014 — that ’s £ 129,347,826 every day , or £ 5,389,492 every hour , or nearly £ 1,500 per second			1
18 seconds is the time it takes @entity4 to earn the average annual wage of a full - time @entity226 worker : £ 26,500			0
8.5 years is how long it would take for @entity93 ( which made £ 1.4 billion profit last year ) to make as much as @entity4 made in just three months , mainly thanks to the @entity1 6			1
600m iphones sold since the smartphone ’s launch in 2007			0
36 % of all the @entity230 sold in the last quarter were bought in @entity129 — 24 per cent in the @entity11 1bn devices that run the @entity235 operating system — including iphones , @entity173 tablet computers and @entity238 — were sold over the past seven years			1

£ 120bn is the total cash reserve — literally , ‘ money in the bank ’ — held by @entity4			1

or it could snap up more than half of @entity251 40 @entity264 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers could be bought with @entity4 ’s cash reserve — four times as many as the @entity266 has			0
£ 41bn is the amount of extra tax the @entity269 would collect if the cash @entity4 holds in off - shore tax havens was brought into the @entity11 and taxed at 35 per cent			1
1 % is the effective rate @entity4 paid in tax on its profits in the @entity226 last year			1
it is estimated the company had £ 10.5 billion of sales here , yet the firm ’s arrangements meant it had to declare just £ 100 million revenue , and a mere £ 59 million profit			1
