the @entity0 is known for its magnificent beaches			1
but with the recession , the waves of good fortune that generally lap its shores became crashing breakers as the financial storm blew harder			0
@entity8 suffered more than most			2
just perfect : @entity8 plays host to a selection of beautiful retreats , including the lovely @entity12 it is not the easiest island to get to , and it is not cheap , so the visitors drained away			1
@entity17 soaked away into the sand , leaving developments marooned , some half - built , on the beaches			2
but though @entity8 lost its mojo for a while , there is no doubt it is still a special place - certainly to judge by some of the visitors who have stuck by it , including @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
of course beaches themselves are not affected by recession			0
and after 25 years of research - exhaustive research , you understand - lying prone on towels and loungers , counting grains of sand , i 'd say that @entity8 has the finest beaches and sea in the @entity0			1
you can get the idea with an early morning walk on a near - deserted strand			0
a gentle stroll ? not in @entity8			2
in places the sand along the mile - and - a - half stretch of @entity51 is so deep that walking becomes aerobic exercise			0
and the waves there are mesmerisingly beautiful - they swell into glassy green , their vertical faces marbling momentarily as they catch the sun , and then furl and crash			0
on top of the bluff at one end of @entity51 is @entity64 , one of the @entity0 's loveliest hotels , which will re-open next month under the flag of @entity68 from @entity69			1
at the other end sits the outsize @entity71 ( with an unfeasible 300 rooms on an island just 16 miles long ) , which has attracted an @entity77 crowd , and sometimes offers good deals			1
@entity80 quality : @entity8 has played host to stars such as @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 , and @entity29 ( right ) for something more sympathetic and self - contained , there 's @entity87 , or the lovely @entity88			1
on the south coast , @entity89 , set on the heart - stoppingly pretty @entity91 , and @entity92 on @entity93 , roll on			0
and that 's not to forget @entity8 's villas , some of the finest in the islands			1
after breaking the mould in the mid- 1990s as the island 's first ' supervilla ' , @entity99 has returned completely restored			2
the spectacular @entity102 , a geometric abstraction in glass and white concrete , which opened to acclaim last year , is opening two more villas on @entity51 soon			0
the restaurateurs have also stuck at it , working hard through difficult times			0
@entity8 's restaurants are excellent - well , it is @entity113 territory with mainly @entity115 visitors - but throw in some @entity117 chefs , and excellent produce brought via nearby @entity119 , and you have excellent cuisine			1
look out for @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
on the beach at @entity51 , @entity126 has opened its @entity128 for simple meals , and @entity117 - inspired @entity130 offers an elegant and lazy lunch			0
@entity8 is much lower - key than nearby @entity132 , but do n't let that put you off			2
you might still bump into @entity83 and @entity84 … @entity135 ( www.turquoiseholidays.co.uk , 01494 678400 ) offers seven nights ( room only ) at @entity89 , with prices starting from £ 1,899 per person			1
this includes @entity142 return flights via @entity143 and onward flights with @entity145 .			0

the little island of @entity8 is one of the @entity0 's less - seen *hotspots*
it has become a *favourite* with *celebrities* such as @entity83 and @entity84
just 15 miles long , it *boasts* some of the @entity0 's finest beaches
