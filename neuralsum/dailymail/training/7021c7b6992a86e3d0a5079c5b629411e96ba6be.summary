@entity0 will be back at @entity1 on saturday but admits the place bears no resemblance to the @entity4 he once knew			1
the @entity6 full back is one of a number of former @entity4 players in @entity11 ’s squad as they attempt to do an unlikely double against the @entity13			1
@entity14 and @entity15 came through the academy ranks at @entity17 and @entity18 was signed as a promising 20 - year - old defender from @entity20 before all were shown the door by sir @entity23			1
@entity0 is targeting an unlikely double against @entity4 on saturday while the latter is still serving a three - match ban after seeing red against @entity28 on january 10 , @entity29 and @entity30 should join @entity31 in the @entity32 ’ starting @entity33 they ’ll know all about the surroundings , but @entity31 insists the familiarities end there given the upheaval at the club since @entity23 ’s retirement in 2013			1
‘ there ’s a few of us here but there is also a quite a lot in the @entity47 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s special for us to go back and try and put in a performance			0
‘ it ’s a bit different as we do n’t know @entity52 as it was sir @entity23 so it ’s good for us to go back			2
@entity31 played with the likes of @entity56 and @entity57 at @entity1 ‘ it ’s a new manager , new ideas and new players so it will take time			2
he is a top class manager with top class players so i ’m sure they are more than satisfied			2
‘ i ’ve had some good results going back to @entity1			0
hopefully we can put in a good performance and we can show desire			0
if we can show that again like we did in our last game against them then you never know			0
‘ that was the 5 - 3 demolition at the @entity74 back in september , after which they wobbled severely – a 13 - match winless run			1
@entity6 beat @entity4 5 - 3 in the corresponding fixture at the @entity74 in september but the last - gasp @entity80 win at @entity81 , coupled with an upturn in the @entity47 , sees @entity11 ’s side travel to @entity4 in a positive manner			1
they are likely to come up against a youthful side , and @entity31 moved to credit @entity87 for blooding youngsters such as @entity89 and @entity90 – even though his own experience was rather more difficult , leaving five years ago after earning just one @entity47 stat. ‘ it ’s a tough first - team to break into but a lot of the young lads are getting a few minutes , ’ he added			2
‘ i ’m sure they will make the most of it and kick on and try and cement themselves as a full time first - team player			0
it ’s a great club so good look to them			0
