by @entity0 published : 18:24 est , 13 october 2012 updated : 18:24 est , 13 october 2012 a convicted murderer has avoided deportation from @entity3 by claiming it would breach his right to a family life			1
@entity7 fathered four children after fleeing to the @entity3 from @entity9 when he was accused of killing the nephew of the country ’s former president			1
he was found guilty in his absence and moves to deport him began when he was traced to the @entity15 of @entity16			1
convicted : @entity7 ( pictured left in @entity17 ) fled to the @entity3 when he was accused of killing @entity18 , the nephew of the former president ( pictured right ) but the 38 - year - old has won his appeal to stay on the grounds that it would be against his human rights to kick him out			1
last night the family of victim @entity18 condemned the decision			2
mr @entity18 ’s brother @entity26 , 34 , said : ‘ i ’m horrified to discover @entity7 is a free man and can not be deported to face justice			2
he is a very bad man , a convicted murderer , and he should be in prison serving his sentence			0
‘ i understand that people have human rights , but justice must come first			0
@entity7 is an extremely dangerous man and the idea that the @entity34 can not deport him is unbelievable			2
‘ he should be locked up , not enjoying his life in the @entity3			0
our family have been devastated by the murder			2
we are not bitter people seeking revenge , but we do ask for justice to be done			0
’ @entity9 police say @entity7 shot 23 - year - old mr @entity18 in october 1996			1
he was arrested two years later but escaped custody by dressing as a female nurse during a visit to hospital and fled the country			0
in 2002 he was tried in his absence and acquitted , but in 2004 prosecutors challenged the acquittal			0
@entity9 authorities insist father - of - six @entity7 was then convicted of murder in a retrial and sentenced in his absence to 18 years			1
in a further twist , @entity7 was said to have launched an appeal against conviction but , although the court ’s 2006 ruling is unknown , this week the police officer in charge of the investigation told @entity62 that @entity7 remained a convicted murderer			1
it is understood the killer arrived in @entity16 in 1998 and moved around to avoid detection , living in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity17			2
family : former @entity9 president @entity71 and his wife @entity72 his wife @entity73 and their eldest two children also came here and the couple have since had four more children			1
@entity79 issued a red notice requesting his capture and in 2009 he was traced to the @entity15 , where he was arrested			0
two weeks after his arrest @entity7 claimed asylum , but the @entity84 rejected his case and tried to deport him			2
the killer , however , appealed the decision and an immigration judge decided he was entitled to remain here under @entity90 of the @entity91 , which states he has a right to a family life			0
this decision was then appealed – unsuccessfully – by the @entity84 at the @entity94 and @entity95			0
@entity7 ’s victim was the nephew by marriage of @entity98 , @entity9 president from 1990 to 1994			1
mr @entity18 ’s family said he was shot 11 times – eight times with a .38 revolver and three times with a shotgun			1
they claimed @entity7 had a professional relationship with the victim and the murder motive was financial			1
police said they found the handgun in @entity7 ’s car and several witnesses placed him at the scene			1
although @entity7 is the only person convicted of the murder , detectives believe there was more than one killer			1
agent @entity117 , of the @entity9 @entity108 ’s @entity118 , said : ‘ this was a particularly brutal murder			1
@entity7 should be here in @entity9 serving his sentence			1
he should not be a free man			0
’ @entity7 now lives with his family in the top - floor flat of a converted terrace house in @entity17 ’s @entity127			1
dressed in loose - fitting tracksuit bottoms and a black hooded top , he said : ‘ i like it here in @entity16			0
it is a good country and i have even got used to the weather			0
’ when asked if he had fled @entity9 after committing murder , he said : ‘ no , that is a lie			1
i left because the police in @entity9 kept shooting at me			2
‘ i will talk to you about all of this but i have to talk to my solicitor to make sure it ’s ok to do so first			0
‘ i would love to give my side of the story , please contact my solicitor because i ’m not sure what i will say or not			0
’ @entity144 , conservative mp for @entity145 and @entity146 , who has tabled a @entity147 to replace the @entity91 with a @entity3 @entity147 , said : ‘ it ’s obvious that he should be sent back to @entity9 on the next available plane			2
the fact that he has created a family in the @entity3 while on the run should not be an excuse to avoid justice			0
’ the @entity155 said : ‘ we are extremely disappointed with the court ’s decision			0
we do not believe this individual needs or deserves refuge in this country			0
we are lodging a challenge against the decision and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment any further			0
’ the @entity62 was unable to reach @entity7 ’s immigration solicitor .			2
