by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 if this truly is to be @entity4 ’s last stand as @entity6 captain then he intends to stay true to himself and go down fighting when he takes on @entity7 in the decisive third test at the @entity9			1
for all his defiance and the full backing of the @entity13 , it is difficult to see how @entity4 could survive another defeat in @entity15 , and a 2 - 0 deficit in this @entity17 series with two to play , against a side who usually can not win away			1
to that end @entity4 , without a hundred in 27 innings , will summon the spirit of 2010 when his form was so bad that he just threw caution to the wind at @entity27 and made a century against @entity28 that saved his international career			1
‘ i could n’t see any light at the end of the tunnel			0
i was really , really struggling			0
so it just came down to an attitude of “ f * * * everything and go and hit the ball ”			0
’ @entity4 , who showed glimpses of regaining his touch at @entity51 before falling to his old failing outside off - stump twice , is adamant that he is in far better shape now as he attempts to stop @entity6 ’s new era crumbling around his feet			1
‘ for the past two or three weeks — and i know we ’re just talking about nets — the ball has been hitting the middle of the bat and going where i want it to , ’ insisted @entity4			2
‘ i feel as if i am moving well			0
‘ at lord ’s i felt i battled hard but got out to the two mistakes i made			0
to me it is not far away			0
my batting felt horrible four years ago and it does n’t feel that way now			0
but i ca n’t keep saying that because people will laugh until i get results			0
’ @entity67 , who will haunt @entity6 ’s attempts at rebuilding until they finally start winning again , became the latest and most predictable former @entity6 captain to say that @entity4 should go			1
‘ for the past three or four weeks everyone ’s been saying it so it ’s no different who else says it , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ but , as i keep saying , i ’m desperate to carry on			0
i love being @entity6 captain			1
it ’s a huge honour			0
‘ i have n’t thought about resigning			0
i ’ve just got to stay true to myself and tell myself how good it would be if i can get through this as a person and as a player and as a leader take huge strides from it			0
' i said when i first took over that i want to throw everything into this and until that time when i do n’t feel as though i can carry on , or someone taps me on the shoulder , that ’s what i am going to carry on doing			0
’ preparation : @entity6 practiced at the @entity9 ahead of the crucial third test against @entity7 netting : @entity6 captain cook is without a century since may 2013 against @entity95 it ’s @entity6 ’s worst losing run for 20 years and now they must surely win the third test against @entity7 at @entity15 to save @entity4 ’s job			1
the run of ten tests without a win is their worst since 1992 - 93 , when teams led by @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 lost nine out of ten matches			2
this time there has been only one captain but @entity4 and his teams have contrived to throw away promising positions in every game.v @entity112 @entity27 , aug @entity114 light stopped play with @entity6 needing 21 runs from four overs to seal a 4 - 0 series win			1
but @entity4 ’s side had lost the initiative on day three , when they scored at just 2.15 runs per over , and were only given a sniff of victory thanks to @entity125 ’s generous final day declaration			2
result : @entity127 , nov @entity126 could have been so different but for a 114 - run stand @entity128 and @entity129 after @entity112 had been 132 - 6 on day one			2
@entity129 went on to score 64 and take nine wickets in the match as @entity6 slumped to their second biggest @entity133 defeat in terms of @entity135 : lost by 381 runsv @entity112 @entity137 , @entity136 were 174 - 4 on day onebut three dropped catches in the final session cost @entity6			1
the last , by @entity140 , reprieved @entity128 on seven			0
he went on to score 118 as @entity112 racked up 570 and @entity129 blew @entity141 : lost by 218 runsv @entity142 , @entity143 added 124 with @entity144 to help @entity112 recover from 143 - 5 and post a score that proved enough against a fragile @entity6 who , despite a second - innings century from @entity146 , were doomed after being set 504 for @entity148 : lost by 150 runsv @entity112 @entity149 , @entity150 by 137 with nine second - innings wickets in hand , @entity6 collapsed twice to throw away their advantage — first losing three wickets for one run , then five wickets for six			1
it left @entity112 chasing just 231 for @entity148 : lost by eight wicketsv @entity112 @entity158 , @entity160 century stand between @entity128 and @entity144 allowed @entity112 to recover from 97 - 5 to post 326 batting first			2
@entity4 ’s team made 155 in reply , slumping to defeat in three @entity164 : lost by 281 runsv @entity166 lord 's			1
june @entity168 tourists escaped defeat thanks to @entity170 after @entity171 was reprieved when wrongly given out to @entity173 ’s penultimate ball of the match			2
yet @entity6 could have wrapped this game up earlier had they not allowed @entity166 to rally from 289 -4 to post 453 in their first @entity176 : @entity178 @entity166 @entity177 , june 2014a 149 - run stand from @entity166 @entity180 and @entity181 , helped by @entity4 ’s reluctance to attack @entity180 , saw the tide turn			1
chasing 350 , @entity6 slumped to 57 - 5 and despite @entity185 ’s ton , lost off penultimate @entity186 : lost by 100 runsv @entity7 @entity188 , @entity187 were allowed to post a century stand for their final first - innings wicket			1
even on day five , with the tourists six down and leading by 148 , @entity6 had a decent chance of victory but their tiring bowlers could not force victory on a dead @entity197 : @entity199 lord ’s , @entity200 bowling poorly on a made - to - order green top , @entity6 had @entity7 145 - 7 on day one			1
but they put on 150 for their final three wickets and , after again being let off at 123 - 4 in the second innings , went on to win as @entity4 ’s side imploded chasing 319 to @entity205 : lost by 95 runs @entity4 knows that there is now almost a universal belief among his predecessors in the commentary boxes that he should step down , even though he has experience of leading @entity6 from 1 - 0 down against @entity7 to win a series			1
‘ i would much rather they said nice things about me , ’ he admitted			0
‘ but they ’ve all been through it and if you are not winning games and not scoring runs it goes with the territory			0
' does it affect me ? i would rather they did n’t say it , but i am quite a strong - willed guy who does not take too much notice of the media			2
‘ i have got to make sure i am concentrating on myself over the next five days and not what people are thinking in the commentary box			0
nothing will give me more satisfaction than if i do pull through this and score runs , because i know how much effort and blood , sweat and tears that have gone into it			0
’ @entity4 and @entity238 , in desperate need of a victory himself in his second coming as coach , face a difficult decision over the make - up of a bowling attack that badly let the captain and side down in the embarrassing defeat at @entity51			1
the word is still that @entity6 want to bring both @entity249 and @entity250 into the side , as well as debutant @entity252 , but it is the question of who stands down that needs to be addressed			2
@entity254 heaped more pressure on @entity256 ahead of his level three disciplinary hearing next friday and @entity6 clearly need the leader of their attack to play — and play well — in @entity15 as there is every chance he will be banned for the last two tests at @entity264 and the @entity27			1
glove work : @entity252 prepares for his @entity266 as he comes in for @entity267 drill : @entity6 bowler @entity173 dives as he practices his fielding while @entity4 watches on the suggestion earlier in the week was that @entity173 would be rested here to protect his damaged knee from the rigours of too big a workload , as he will be needed more than ever if @entity256 is missing from the last two games			1
yet @entity173 has been passed fit and is clearly desperate to play on a pitch which should have bounce , pace and carry , leaving @entity6 to decide whether to go for broke here and back the senior bowlers who have let @entity4 down			1
it would be harsh on @entity281 if he proved to be the one who missed out but he was feeling a hamstring at @entity51 and would be needed in @entity284 should @entity256 be found guilty next week			0
it is another headache for a side who have unravelled spectacularly since winning the @entity133 last summer			0
the next five days will decide if there is to be another seismic shift within the ranks and a new captain is needed .			2
