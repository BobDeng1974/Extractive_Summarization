these incredible pictures show the moment a plucky seal managed to twist away from the killer jaws of a great white shark after being thrown into the air			1
the great white burst from the water only for the seal to bounce off the tip of its nose and be thrown in the air			1
on the way down the shark snapped with its razor - sharp jaws , missing the airborne seal by the finest of margins			1
the great white shark burst from the water and snapped at the airborne seal with its killer jaws - missing by a matter of inches the heart - stopping moment was captured by @entity24 near @entity25 in @entity26 - a prime feeding location for sharks the predators are attracted to the area when the population of @entity32 is at its highest creating what is known as the ' @entity34 ' the heart - stopping scene was captured by underwater photographer @entity24 near @entity37 , in @entity26			1
due to the dense population of seals on @entity25 - just a few kilometres from @entity37 - the location is a prime feeding location for great whites			1
mr @entity24 , 51 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' the boat began to follow the seals back to @entity25 where there are around 70,000 seals			2
' during this process the seals are often the subject of attacks by great white sharks			2
' they launch themselves from underneath the seal , knocking it above the surface and snapping the mammal in their mouths			0
' the speed with which the sharks attack brings them to jump completely out of the water			0
i was glad to see the seal escape on this occasion			0
