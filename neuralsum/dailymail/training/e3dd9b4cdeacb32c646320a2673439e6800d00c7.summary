these photographs may look like they have been duplicated , but together they give a rare and extraordinary @entity2 view of the @entity3			1
the rare pictures are among the few in existence showing the devastating battles and the appalling conditions soldiers suffered between 1914 and 1918 in this way			2
they do not work with the naked eye and require a stereoscope , an early form of 3d glasses , which forces a viewer 's eyes to cross and make the two pictures converge and appear three dimensional			1
going over the top : these soldiers find themselves in the firing line at @entity21 as @entity23 soldiers fight the @entity24 on the @entity25 eye - popping : this is a rare @entity2 picture of the famous disaster on the @entity29 as @entity24 troops blow up a bridge isolating allied battalions during the @entity3			1
separately they are @entity33 but viewed through a stereoscope they become @entity2 eerie : a soldier inspects the ruins of the destroyed cathedral at @entity40 on @entity42 's border with @entity43 the key : all the images require a stereoscope - which makes the eyes cross and the two images will then diverge into one to create a 3d photograph the historic collection of 100 3d photos were taken along the @entity25 , including at the @entity52 , the @entity53 , and @entity54			1
away from the front line there are also images of the @entity58 , @entity60 commanders discussing plans of attack as well as buildings and streets devastated by fighting			0
but there is also a twist , because although most are genuine battlefield shots , others were produced as propaganda to show the war was going well			2
experts say some claiming to be from the first battle of @entity54 , are thought to have actually been taken on a training ground in @entity74			1
the collection is being sold at auction tomorrow in @entity77			0
trench life : @entity80 soldiers sit in trenches while under fire from snipers , with their mascot at the feet getting some rest : soldiers are described as resting on a road near @entity89 in @entity43 , after weeks of fighting at @entity54 drink : @entity80 , one of @entity93 's most historic regiments , stop for water from a town centre pump health care at war : @entity99 at @entity100 dressing station attend to wounded coming down the line during the conflict that started 100 years ago leaders : sir @entity104 , commander in chief in @entity42 , stands with other commanders in the garden of his headquarters royalty : the @entity58 , who would one day be @entity109 , briefly , in the garden of the chateau which was his hq in @entity42 during the conflict @entity114 , an auctioneer who specialises in historical documents , said : ' it 's not often you find 100 images like these together in a complete collection			1
' what is quite interesting is that there are some that appear to be actual battle field images which were actually photographed on a training ground because there are no bodies with wounds or any evidence of artillery present			0
' no individual with a stereo camera would have been so close to an assault where the enemy was climbing over the sandbags			0
' it 's actually evidence of the @entity3 media spin , which is quite fun really			0
' back home : a zeppelin shot down near @entity145 towers over a nearby farmhouse near the @entity147 the auctioneer at @entity149 in @entity77 , @entity150 , added : ' looking through a @entity152 - viewer at the images would have been quite sensational at the time because you could n't have felt much closer to the action while being in the safety of your own drawing room			0
' the pictures , which form the complete first volume of a @entity161 , are believed to be part of a larger set designed for a stereoscope			1
five further volumes were produced and a complete series contains 600 stereoviews			0
although showing the same image left and right when layered on top of each other underneath the scope , they form a unique three - dimensional view			2
the set of images , which mr @entity114 believes are among the best he had seen from the period , are expected to sell for between £ 150 to £ 200 when they go under the hammer today			0

they look like duplicates , but using a stereoscope the photos merge to create a stunning @entity2 image
collection of 100 pictures were taken along the @entity25 including at the @entity188 , @entity54 and @entity21
but others may have been set - up in @entity74 to *spread* *positive* propaganda across country about life in trenches
