@entity0 has asked a judge to temporarily halt ' economic loss ' based payments the compensation settlement is one of the biggest in @entity7 history with $ 7.8bn set aside the explosion on the @entity10 oil rig killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep - sea well head which took 84 days to seal third anniversary of the spill is one month away published : 13:35 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 16 march 2013 @entity0 has launched an appeal against " fictitious " and " absurd " oil spill compensation payouts and has asked a judge to temporarily halt the payments being made to businesses on an ' economic loss ' basis			1
in a @entity23 court filing , @entity0 gave examples of companies in industries far away from the spill and completely unconnected with the coastline that enjoyed bigger profits during the year of the spill in 2010 and yet still received millions in compensation			2
the @entity33 oil and gas group , which has already sold a substantial part of its business to pay out compensation and fines as a result of the disaster , said it could be ' irreparably harmed ' by the payouts because they could cost it ' billions ' more than it budgeted for when it agreed to a settlement in april 2012			0
compensation : @entity10 , off @entity44 in @entity45 2010 - the worst offshore oil spill in @entity7 history it reopens a part of the saga that appeared to have been settled almost a year ago when @entity0 agreed terms on economic , property and medical compensation for more than 100,000 individuals and businesses who had filed a class action suit			1
at the time of the settlement , @entity0 estimated the bill would be $ 7.8 billion - already making it one of the biggest settlements of its kind in @entity7 history			1
the actual amount is uncapped , and dependent on decisions made by @entity65 , a lawyer from @entity44 who administers the payments under a complex set of rules set out by the agreement			0
compensation : @entity0 has already sold a substantial part of its business to pay compensation and fines resulting from the disaster and there is likely to be more to come as the payments started to flow out , @entity0 realized that the funds it had set aside would be insufficient			1
at first , it added more , reaching $ 8.5 billion by the end of 2012 , while complaining that the payments to businesses were too generous and the terms of the settlement were being misinterpreted			0
the april 2010 spill happened when the @entity85 well ruptured and the @entity10 rig that was working on it exploded and sank			1
the accident killed 11 men and spouted 4 million barrels of oil into the @entity92 in the @entity7 ' worst offshore oil spill			1
last year @entity0 agreed to pay compensation to around 100,000 people and companies - including fishermen and restaurant owners - who claimed the oil spill had harmed their livelihoods or their health			1
in its filing , among the examples @entity0 offered of ' absurd ' claims , the @entity33 company referred to a $ 21 million payment made to a rice mill in @entity44 situated some 40 miles from the coast that earned more revenue than in spill year of 2010 than in the previous three years			2
it also cited a $ 9.7 million recompense for a highway , street and bridge construction company in northern @entity114 , almost 200 miles from the @entity92 , and which does no business in the region , and for which 2010 was its best year on record			0
not adding up : @entity0 set aside $ 42 billion to deal with compensation claims from businesses that were affected but it says many are simply " fictitious " and " absurd " @entity0 also referred to a digital printing business and a law firm that had been compensated despite strong profits			2
claimants can demonstrate a loss by choosing to compare ' any consecutive three months from 2010 ' with ' a large combination of months going back to january 2007			0
' the company had set aside $ 42 billion to pay compensation claims - equivalent to about 30 percent of its stock market value			0
it has also sold assets worth $ 38 billion in order the to finance the compensation , clean - ups and fines			0
the company has already promised to pay $ 37 billion but billions more could be piled on in economic damage claims from @entity139 states despite having already agreed in 2012 to pay $ 4.5bn to settle criminal charges .			0
