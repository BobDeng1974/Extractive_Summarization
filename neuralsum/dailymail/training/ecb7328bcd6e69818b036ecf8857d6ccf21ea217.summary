by @entity0 why spend hundreds of dollars on a boring paint job for your car when you can cover it in the actual money instead ? these were the bizarre thoughts of an @entity8 couple who have given their vintage @entity10 the ultimate bling makeover			2
when @entity13 and @entity14 saw an advert for a 1949 @entity16 back in 1999 , they decided it could n't hurt to take a look			1
they got there to find it covered with layers of snow , and once they had scraped it away , saw that the paintwork was dull , and the colour of an old penny			0
@entity30 history : @entity13 and @entity14 , from @entity31 , @entity8 , bought a classic cadillac in 1999 , and set about covering every inch of paintwork with more than 38,000 one cent coins bling : the car , appropriately named @entity37 , underwent a real money makeover , and weighs 14 stone more than it did when the couple discovered it covered with snow 15 years ago this gave them an idea - they would buy the car and cover every inch of it with one cent coins			1
six weeks later , ' @entity37 ' was born			2
the unique ' paint job ' , consisting of 38,295 individual coins , is worth exactly $ 382.95 - roughly the same as it would cost to have it spray painted			1
mrs @entity14 , 48 , from @entity31 , said : ' once we had brushed the snow off and discovered she was already the colour of an old penny , we decided it was fate			0
teamwork : friends , family and even strangers pitched in to help with the bizarre project , which took six weeks then and now : penny as she was ( left ) and how she looks today , covered with coins ( right ) @entity66 painstakingly sticks another coin to the car during the project 's early stages ' we started with our jar of pennies but blew through those pretty quickly			1
' @entity37 came from friends , family , and even strangers who just wanted to be a part of the project			1
' in the 15 years we 've owned @entity37 we 've had great fun with her and created some wonderful memories			1
' mrs @entity14 and her 51 - year - old husband ' minted up ' the car with the help of their two children			0
@entity86 , 25 , and @entity87 , 22 , were ten and seven at the time , and @entity37 has been with them as they have gone through school and become adults			0
a 10 - year - old @entity91 , now 25 , perches on the bonnet and gets to work on the roof the family still drive the car at weekends and during the summer , and they have also displayed it at shows mrs @entity14 had to order coins from the @entity100 mint , as banks only stock around $ 12 worth of cents at a time every coin was stuck on by hand , and they add a whopping 14 stone to the car 's weight , though it still gets driven at weekends and during the summer , and has been displayed at multiple shows			1
as banks only store around $ 12 worth of pennies at any given time , @entity14 needed to specially order coins from the @entity100 mint			0
mrs @entity14 's one regret is that she never got to show @entity37 's original owner what her family had done with the car			2
' i like to think we helped to fulfil her destiny - i 'd love to know how the original owner feels about what we did with her , ' she said			0
' i tried locating him but discovered he 'd passed away shortly before we purchased her			0
' not long ago we crossed paths with one of his grandsons at a car show , who said his grandfather would have loved the car			0

vintage 1949 @entity16 is covered with $ 382.95 worth of cents
@entity135 have owned the car for 15 years and still drive it
' @entity37 ' weighs 14 stone more thanks to its unusual *bodywork*
friends , family and even strangers helped with the six - week project
