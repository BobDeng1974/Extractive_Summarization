wolves continued their recent upturn in form by claiming a deserved 1 - 0 win at @entity4 to complete back - to - back away victories in the @entity6			1
the @entity7 had gone into the contest seeking a fourth straight success , but they were completely outplayed in the first half as the visitors spurned numerous opportunities to gain the upper hand			0
but the goal they deserved arrived in the 57th minute when @entity16 converted a low @entity18 centre			1
@entity16 scored the only goal of the game to give his side the three points at @entity23 @entity24 tries to win the ball from @entity4 winger @entity26 during the @entity6 encounter @entity4 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity28 ; @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; parades , @entity33 ( @entity34 64 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 72 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 63 ) subs not used : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 booked : @entity35 , @entity39 @entity47 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity48 ; @entity24 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity18 , @entity54 ( @entity55 92 ) , @entity56 ; @entity16 ( @entity57 89 ) subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 goal : @entity16 57 referee : @entity65 the @entity7 did hit the woodwork twice in the last 15 minutes but , in truth , an equaliser would have been harsh on their opponents			1
wolves had come into the game with only one win in their last eight league games , but they were left wondering how they did not take the lead during an excellent opening 20 minutes in which they caused their hosts numerous problems			2
along from the quality of their finishing , the main reason the visitors did not make the breakthrough was down to the excellence of @entity28 , who made two high - class saves to keep his side level			0
the @entity88 first showed fine reactions to get down and divert a close - range effort from @entity54 behind after being set up by @entity53 , before surpassing that with a spectacular full - length save to tip over an excellent 30 - yard strike from @entity56			0
@entity4 did manage to weather that storm but shortly after the half - hour mark a fine @entity96 through ball cut apart the @entity7 ' defence and put @entity16 through on goal , but he passed up a golden opportunity by sliding the ball wide of the target			1
the home side needed to change something at the start of the second period because they had been so disappointing for much of the opening 45 minutes and head coach @entity108 opted for a change in formation from 3 - 5 - 2 to 4 - 4 - 2			0
@entity111 attempts to win possession back for his side as @entity16 gets the ball under control initially it looked like the move might pay dividends as the home side began to at last offer an attacking threat , with @entity40 and @entity35 forcing @entity48 into his first saves of the match			1
but any hopes the @entity7 had of building on this were ended in the 57th minute when @entity47 got the goal their first - half display had so deserved			1
@entity18 was the instigator as he attacked the left side of the defence and got to the byline before laying the ball across for @entity16 to convert the simplest of chances to make it 1 - 0			2
@entity108 made three changes as he tried to galvanise his troops to get back in the game and they did go close from a couple of goalmouth scrambled before , in the 74th minute , substitute @entity41 took advantage of a defender slipping to fire in a shot which almost surprised @entity48 as he pushed it on to his crossbar at the near post			2
that looked like being the home side 's best chance of an equaliser until the game entered stoppage time when @entity41 was again denied by the woodwork after being found in the area , this time with @entity48 beaten			0
@entity47 manager @entity155 will be delighted with his side 's @entity157 win against @entity4			0

@entity16 scored the only goal of the game in the 57th minute
@entity4 had won their last three games going into home match
wolves are now just four points behind @entity6 rivals @entity4
