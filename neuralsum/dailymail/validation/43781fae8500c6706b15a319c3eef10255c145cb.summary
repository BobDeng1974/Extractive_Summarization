it is called the ' happiest place on @entity3 ' , but not , you may think , for your bank balance			2
for families whose children are pressuring them to visit the magical theme park in @entity11 , the expenses can quickly rack up			1
but there are some tricks of the trade to help enjoy @entity15 on a budget			1
from clever packages to websites selling discounted tickets and even the option to camp instead of staying in a hotel , there are plenty of ways to cut costs			1
you will pay a premium for simple vitals such as sun tan lotion , plasters and water @entity35 instead of staying in a hotel yes there are plenty of themed hotels at @entity15 , but you will part with a lot of money for the privilege of staying within the parks			1
but @entity15 offers a range of accommodation from castles to campsites , and the latter can be as inexpensive as $ 43 ( £ 28 ) per night			1
stay at the @entity50 , in a rented tent , or bring your own for the cheapest price			2
complimentary shuttles are available to all the parks , and you can enjoy the campsite 's pool , canoeing and archery activities in its 750 acres woodland setting			2
experience the happiest place on earth without paying a fortune ! shop around a few months in advance for the best ticket prices , and never buy on the door sign up for the @entity68 the @entity69 are offered for @entity71 holidaymakers staying in a @entity15 resort			1
they have to be booked in advance , and operate by purchasing a card with allocated meals loaded onto them			2
the cards can be swiped and deducted when in the parks , at a range of locations			1
these are useful as you wo n't be tempted to go over budget , and you can pay in advance before you reach the parks and are tempted to splurge out			1
attraction tickets sold online do not fall into the trap of buying on the door			1
not only will you have to queue for longer to get into the park , you will also miss out on the cheaper ticket prices			2
just last month it was reported that single - day ticket prices are expected rise to $ 105 ( £ 69.57 ) for the @entity92 and $ 99 ( £ 65.50 ) for the three other resort parks - @entity94 , @entity95 and the @entity96			2
one - day tickets for the @entity92 currently cost $ 99 before tax and entrance to each of the other parks in the resort costs $ 94 ( £ 62.28 )			1
but there is no need to pay the full entry price			2
if you do your research you can certainly find sites such as attraction - tickets - direct.co.uk offering deals and combination tickets to make it all cheaper			1
it is worth noting that children under three get into the park for free , and children over ten are classed as adults			0
there are military discounts available for those who qualify			0
explore the magic : the best place to find out what is in the park is not once you are in			0
read about the best attractions , and wait times on your journey to avoid long queues shop for packages that include unlimited park access @entity131 is currently doing a deal for a 14 - day @entity15 park ticket for the price of a seven - day ticket			1

when laid end to end , there are enough of the famous ' @entity157 ' hats sold each year to stretch 175 miles or cover the head of every man , woman and child in @entity162 , @entity11 there are also enough @entity15 character t - shirts sold to put @entity167 's smiling face on the chest of every resident of @entity170			1
if you stacked the number of standard autograph books sold annually , it would match the height of 200 @entity176			0
add the @entity179 - style autograph books and , end to end , the books would reach 88 miles into space			1
@entity182 is one busy place			0
every day an average of 210 pairs of sunglasses are turned in and , since 1971 , an estimated 1.65 million pairs of glasses have found their way into the ' lost ' bin			0

according to long - time @entity182 staffers , the most unusual items turned in have been a glass eye , a prosthetic leg and a potty trainer			1
each , incidentally , was claimed ( but not by the same person )			0
source : @entity15 time management is vital there are four theme parks at the @entity148 , and if you have the time , a full day is advised to experience everything you can there			1
it is tempting to maximise your freedom and opt for a park hopper ticket , allowing entry into more than one park in a day			0
note : these tickets are more expensive , as you are paying for the luxury of park choice			1
if you have decided to use this , for example those on a limited time schedule , it is key to strategise your day before you arrive			1
look on the map and on a @entity15 wait time app to see which attractions are the most popular and do them first , or last			1
easy @entity148 has dedicated maps for which rides to tackle first			0
your park ticket can act as a free fast track ticket for some rides , giving you a time to come back during the day to a faster queue line			1
eating during peak lunch hours will slow your day down if you are queuing in the restaurants , bring your own lunch for a cheaper , and quicker pit stop			0
do n't go during the summer the summer holidays are the peak time to go to @entity15 , meaning higher prices and longer queue times			1
early summer is when the parks are busiest so consider going in the late summer months or in winter to take advantage of cheaper tickets			1
early september is a good time to visit as the temperatures are lower , and most schools will be back after the holidays			1
use @entity251 to help budget for the trip			1
these must be bought in advance , but help to limit what you spend in the parks arrive at park opening to get all the hours you pay for			0
not only will temperatures and queues be lower , you will maximise what you can see during your day plan ahead and bring supplies the parks are set up to cater to your every need , but there is a hefty price attached to basic items			0
eliminate extra costs by bringing everything you require to the parks , so you are n't forced to fork out on essentials like toiletries , sunscreen , plasters , and snacks			2
get there @entity278 are paying for every hour the park is open , so maximise your time in the park , especially when the queues and temperatures are low			2
tasty treats : at every corner in @entity15 is a new snack for guests during their stay			1
bring your own snacks to avoid splurging out , on top of your ticket price @entity291 if you are planning on hiring a pushchair when you are there , it can be extremely expensive if you are there for an extended stay			0
be prepared to pay about $ 15 ( £ 10 ) per day at the parks , and it could be worth buying a cheap one from @entity300 for $ 20 ( £ 13 ) for your holiday			2
souvenir refill drinks instead of forking out for a number of drinks , either bring your own bottles and refill at the water stations , or invest in a souvenir refill mug			0
these cost around $ 15 ( £ 10 ) and entitle you to free refills for your holiday			2
if you do n't mind sharing , why not invest in one for your group and split the cost , and all reap the free rewards during your stay			0
some hotels offer extra hours for their guests , it could be worth paying for these hotels instead of paying for another day 's ticket to see all the attractions bring your own food dining at @entity15 is designed to accommodate a range of budgets , but a cheeseburger , chips and a drink will still cost about £ 10			1
bring snacks to last the day and maximise your time in the park			2
do n't fall into the souvenir trap it is so tempting to want to buy every item with mickey mouse 's face on it , but before you splurge on expensive goods , realise that it is not the only place to buy disney presents and goods			0
if you have eager children , the @entity341 suggests stocking up on small merchandise from cheaper shops before you go , and producing them during the trip so they wo n't be tempted to want every product in the shops			2
a lot of children want to get their favourite character 's autographs , so make sure you come armed with one before you go			0
merchandise is available at cheaper shops , and presents and treats can be bought before you go to keep costs low remember you will pay for parking you will start forking out before you set foot in the park , so be aware of this , and factor it into your budget			1
many of the nearby hotels offer free shuttles to the park			0
but if you are staying further out , driving there will be your only option			0
currently automobiles , taxis , limos and motorcycles currently cost $ 17 ( approx £ 11 ) a day to park , with campers and and rv costing a dollar more			0
what is good to know is once you 've paid this at one of the parks , you do not have to pay again at the other disney theme parks that day			0
if you know people in the area , a free lift to the drop off zone is the best option to avoid paying			0
most importantly , relax and enjoy your trip			0
if you plan in advance you can have a great day and not break the bank at the same time			2
