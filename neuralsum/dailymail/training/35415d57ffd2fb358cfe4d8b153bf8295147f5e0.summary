when @entity2 's @entity1 leads his non-league team out at @entity4 on sunday , he will give silent thanks to his famous pal @entity6 who allowed him to live like a @entity14 king rent - free in @entity10 's mansion when his future as a full - time professional was very much in the balance			1
back in 2011 , @entity1 's career was at a crossroads			1
having started out at the bottom of the football pyramid with @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , a move up to the conference with @entity24 had n't worked out and he was forced to try out at @entity2 without a guaranteed salary			0
he could n't afford to pay the petrol for the daily 160 - mile round trip from his home in the @entity31 to @entity32 , and was indebted when @entity6 , then of @entity33 , invited him to lodge with him in @entity10 's palatial five - bedroom home in @entity35 , complete with indoor swimming pool , steam room , jacuzzi , gym and wine area			1
@entity1 was all smiles as he sat down to talk to @entity42 about his eventual last few years in the game the 26 - year - old is set to face @entity14 opposition in the shape of @entity4 in the @entity47 on sunday ' @entity6 was renting the house and was very generous letting me stay there , ' explains @entity1			1
' i was able to go into training at @entity2 happy and it paid off because i got the contract , i 've been there four years and now we 've got this great @entity47 third round game to look forward to			1
' once inside the gates , @entity1 says life was pretty normal , though there was one giveaway sign about the identity of the famous owner			2
' all of @entity10 's stuff had been moved out			2
the only way you could tell it was his were the handles of the doorknobs and chests of drawers had the number seven engraved into them			0
' i did n't pay rent — i would n't have been able to afford to pay the proper going rate — but i helped out in the garden and with other stuff			1
' @entity1 , 26 , got to know ' @entity77 ' through @entity79 's @entity78 , a mutual friend who was also at @entity4 at the time , and the pair hit it off as golf and music enthusiasts			1
@entity1 opens up to @entity42 's @entity85 about how his close friend @entity6 helped him out @entity6 - seen here after scoring against @entity33 - is a close friend of @entity1 's on sunday afternoon , the spotlight will be on @entity1 , who gave up carpentry to play football and believes he may have two or three years to achieve his @entity91 dream			1
' i 've got a lot of energy			0
i try to get in both boxes , break up play and keep it simple , and then go on the occasional crazy run , ' he explains			0
' a lot of @entity14 sides do n't fancy going to @entity4 but for us it 's a chance to test yourself against top players			2
they make the game look easy on the telly , so you want to put yourself in the situation and see how you deal with it			0
' we 've had experience of playing in front of 35,000 at @entity110 in the @entity112 final so we do n't have to feel overawed			0
there is n't any pressure on us			0
' it 's a huge day for @entity2 , who fell on hard times and were saved from extinction in 2011 when fans raised £ 127,000 to stop them being kicked out of the @entity120			0
@entity1 lodged in a house rented out by @entity10 to @entity6 when his career was in the balance now fan - owned , they boast an @entity47 - winner in director of football operations @entity127 , one of @entity79 's @entity128 who helped beat @entity130 in 1995			1
' i know ( @entity4 manager ) @entity133 , he was a @entity134 team - mate of mine , and he wo n't be taking anything for granted , ' @entity127 says			1
twenty - three years after @entity2 caused an @entity47 sensation by beating league champions @entity139 with @entity141 's goal , the @entity137 have the taste for another upset			2
it might be too much to ask for some of @entity10 's magic to rub off on @entity1 , but you never know			2
' i 've seen that @entity148 is renting the house now			0
it was good to see a picture of it on @entity153 and think ' i stayed there , ' he smiles .			0

it could have been so different for @entity1 had he not had the help of his friend @entity6 when his career was in the balance in 2011
the then @entity33 winger let @entity1 stay rent - free in the mansion he was renting off none other than @entity10
@entity1 could n't afford to pay the petrol for the 160 - mile round trip from his home to north wales but @entity6 *stepped* in to help
now four years on @entity1 faces @entity133 ' @entity4 side in the @entity47
