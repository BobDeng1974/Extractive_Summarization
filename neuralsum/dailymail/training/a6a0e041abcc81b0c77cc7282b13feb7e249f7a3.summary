published : 07:36 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 17 may 2013 sparkling slabs of the ' white gold ' at the heart of @entity4 's ancient salt trade form patterns in a vast desert basin in this incredible image			1
for centuries @entity4 have made the long trek to the @entity8 - one of the hottest and harshest environments in the world - to collect salt from the sun - blasted earth before transporting the slabs back by camel			1
but a tradition that has continued for hundreds of years could be set to change beyond recognition , with the construction of a paved road cutting through the @entity8			1
xxxxx ' most of the people who live here are dependent on the salt caravans , so we are not happy with prospective salt companies that try to set up base here , ' said @entity54 , a chief and clan leader 's son in @entity57 , on the salt desert 's edge			1
' everything has to be initiated from the community			0
we prefer to stick with the old ways , ' he added			0
changing times : @entity65 caravans have been making the journey to the @entity8 for hundreds of years , but construction is now underway on a tarmac road through the desert basin @entity8 : once the merchants find a suitable place to mine , they extract , shape and pack as many salt slabs as possible before embarking on the two - day journey back to the town of @entity77 lonely landscape : a camel caravan loaded with slabs of salt can be seen making its way back to civilisation from the @entity8 in the north of the @entity86 country arduous trek : @entity65 caravans and journeyed to and from the remote @entity4 salt desert in this way for hundreds of years solitary trek : an armed @entity93 man steps on rocks as he crosses a river close to the @entity8 in @entity4 the tarmac road will link the highland city of @entity99 with the village of @entity26 in the @entity8 , a harsh but hauntingly beautiful geographical wonder of salt flats and volcanoes once described as ' a land of death ' by the famous @entity107 desert explorer @entity108			1
the road has cut from five hours to three the drive from @entity99 to @entity77 , a town two days ' trek by camel from the @entity93 salt deposits that are one of @entity4 's main sources of the crystalline food product			1
new roads like these are gradually helping to transform this landlocked @entity121 state , which has a unique culture and history but has been racked by coups , famines and droughts , into one of the fastest - growing economies on the continent			0
as @entity86 's biggest coffee producer , @entity4 's economy remains based on agriculture , which accounts for 46 percent of gross domestic product and 85 percent of employment			2
but its nearly 94 million population - the second biggest in @entity86 - is attracting the attention of foreign investors hungry for new markets			0
mining : a worker sets about extracting salt from the desert in the @entity8 in northern @entity4 , which has an average annual temperature of @entity143 ( @entity144 ) manual work : a worker ties together slabs of salt that have been extracted from the sun - blasted earth in the vast @entity8 feeding time : miners who have relied on camels to make the long journey to the salt desert for centuries fear a planned road making the region more accessible could threaten their ancient trade arid : a man extracts salt from the desert in the @entity8 , where rain never falls and average annual temperatures creep towards @entity164 @entity86 tradition : a camel herder and salt merchant clutches rope in the @entity8 , the unforgiving region at the heart of @entity4 's ancient salt trade further south in the @entity8 , at the salt reserve of @entity173 , industrial salt production is already under way			1
a company named @entity176 and @entity177 came to the desert plains near @entity57 in 2011 aiming to produce salt there , according to @entity181 leaders saw the threat to their ancient trade and lined up to oppose the project			2
fearing sabotage of its equipment , the company left the following year , local people said			0
but @entity54 still welcomed the new road			0
' the new highway will give easy access to the market , which will bring benefits and development to this region , ' @entity54 said			0
years of journeys : @entity196 , a retired salt merchant , was 15 years old when he first began trekking with caravans of camels to the desert basin in northern @entity4 the development he talks of is visible in @entity77 , where caravans from the salt pans come to drop off their cargo so it can be transported to the rest of the country			1
most residents are involved directly or indirectly in the salt business			0
telephone and electricity networks have been extended to the town over the past four years , a new @entity209 was established in 2010 to facilitate trade and a recently built salt store is now the biggest construction in town			2
toiling in the heat : miners extract salt before shaping and packing the slabs , loading up their camels and preparing for the long , slow trek across the vast desert basin back to the nearest town long journey : a worker loads a camel with slabs of salt in the @entity8 in northern @entity4 , before making the long journey back across the desert basin dry heat : scores of camels form a caravan to trek across the barren landscape in the @entity86 desert pack animals : camels walk in single file behind a salt merchant through the vast , barren landscape ' thousands of people benefit from this work as the salt here is exported throughout the country , ' said the head of the association , @entity249			1
for now , tradition and modernity co-exist - the organisation buys salt from the caravans that make the four - day trek to the salt flats and back , then sells it to merchants who carry it away by truck			1
the salt blocks , which were once used as a unit of money , are sold across @entity4 , many of them to farmers to provide their animals with essential minerals			2
@entity4 has the largest livestock population on the @entity86 continent			2
life is harsh for the thousands of camel herders and salt extractors who use traditional hoes and axes to carve the ' white gold ' out of the ground in the @entity8			2
many of the salt diggers live in @entity57 and hire out their services to different caravans			0
the work , however exhausting , still draws thousands onto the baking salt flats			0
' you forget about the sun and the heat , ' said @entity288 , 45 , a camel herder and salt merchant			0
' i lost a friend once on the salt desert because he was working too much with no protection from the sun. eventually he just collapsed			0
' water source : young residents of @entity297 pump water from a well in the @entity8 rest stop : @entity301 merchants are seen posing for a photograph after they stop to rest for the night in a canyon on their way back to town from the remote salt desert making camp : merchants and their pack animals rest side by side as they journey back from extracting salt from the desert basin final destination : the lights of @entity77 in @entity93 , where much of the economy revolves around the salt trade wares : workers unload slabs of salt from their camels upon arrival in the town of @entity77 , in afar precious cargo : a young man heaves slabs of salt onto a truck in @entity77 in @entity4 , after the long journey from the @entity8			1

for centuries @entity4 have been making the long trek with camels to collect salt from the @entity8
@entity337 salt slabs from the sun - blasted earth desert basin before making two - day trek back to nearest town
ancient tradition set to change with *completion* of a paved road across northern region
