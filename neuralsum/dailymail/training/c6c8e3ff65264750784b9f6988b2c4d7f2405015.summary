mr @entity42 wants @entity10 kept off all stages in @entity1 , denouncing what he calls the ' mechanics of hate ' relayed by the comic			2
the city of @entity3 had banned the comic 's performance , but a @entity3 court overturned that ban earlier yesterday			1
mr @entity42 then took the matter to the ultimate authority , the @entity68 , asking for an unusual urgent decision			0
' in the face of the mechanics of hate ... we need firmness and determination and great calm , ' the interior minister said			1
a fan performs the ' quenelle ' and holds a pineapple , which symbolises the comic 's conviction for using the word ' @entity98 ' - a mash - up of the @entity101 word for @entity39 and the @entity1 word for the fruit citing a risk to public safety , the council banned the performance only two hours before the show was to begin			1
it brushed aside claims that @entity10 would change his show to avoid offensive language and said a ' serious risk ' of ' grave attacks ' to fundamental @entity1 values could not be dismissed			1
mr @entity42 declared that @entity1 had been made stronger by the decision to keep @entity10 off the stage in @entity3			1
' ( but ) the combat against the nauseating words of this personage continues , ' he said			0

outrage : a woman holds a shirt showing a drawing of @entity1 controversial humorist @entity10 as people gather in front of the @entity9 venue in @entity3 mr @entity10 calls the gesture ' la quenelle ' - the word for an elongated creamed fish dumpling - and says it stands for his anti-zionist and anti-establishment views , not anti-semitism			1
the gesture , said to resemble a @entity44 salute , was brought to international attention last month when @entity141 ( pictured above with mr @entity10 ) made it after scoring a goal for @entity144			2
the salute involves extending one arm , as in a @entity44 salute , but keeping it by your side as you touch your shoulder with the other arm			0
the gesture has gone viral on social media in recent weeks , with mostly young fans displaying it at parties and sports events			0
some do it while in the audience at live television shows			0
two soldiers were sanctioned by the army in september for making the gesture in uniform in front of a @entity166 synagogue			0
the ' quenelle ' is a key component of the @entity10 act , and he has himself threatened to sue those who object to it			2

his fans and police eventually dispersed without serious incidents after the show was cancelled			2
yesterday 's legal drama may be just the beginning of a longer battle			0
the @entity3 show was to kick off a national tour			1

' we have a country in which anti-semitism is freely accepted , ' he said			0
mr @entity42 is the most popular minister in @entity1 's @entity205 government , but his adamant stance against @entity10 , while drawing praise from leading conservative rivals , has left some mystified			1
fears have been expressed that any bans on the show could prove counter-productive or even illegal			0
the comic was convicted last fall for using the word ' @entity98 ' a mash - up of the @entity101 word for @entity39 and the @entity1 word for pineapple			2
a song containing the word is seen as deriding @entity39 survivors and victims			0
