how would you feel if one day you awoke to find your @entity1 , @entity2 or @entity3 tones inexplicably gone , with a @entity5 , @entity6 or even @entity7 accent in its place ? 38 - year - old @entity9 does n't have to wonder			1
on march 7 , 2010 , she woke up to discover that her customary @entity11 pronunciation had gone - replaced by @entity13 enunciation			1
@entity9 is one of the handful of people to be diagnosed with @entity16 , a condition so rare there were just 61 confirmed cases between 1941 and 2012			1
@entity9 woke up to find she had a @entity13 accent in place of her normal @entity3 tones so what is it like to live with a voice that is not your own ? a new @entity28 documentary , the woman who woke up @entity13 , aims to find some answers			1
the star of the show is @entity9 herself , whose bizarre @entity13 accent is completely at odds with her looks , background and experiences			1
after suffering a severe migraine , @entity9 was rushed to hospital only for doctors to be left baffled after she developed a strong @entity13 accent			1
' it 's just been such a horrible thing to go through , ' she sobs in the opening scenes of the documentary			0
' people automatically assume i 'm foreign , for a start , then they like to try and work out where i might be from			0
' @entity9 is seen getting her hair cut in a @entity11 salon , where the hairdresser asks where she 's from and how long she has lived there			2
@entity9 has struggled to cope with the fact that people regularly assume that she hails from abroad @entity9 's accent has left her struggling to be understood - and the butt of cruel jokes it 's all the more galling because @entity9 has lived and worked in the city all her life			1
it 's perhaps no surprise then , that since that fateful 2010 day , @entity9 's focus has been almost entirely on getting her voice back			2
but with doctors and scientists equally mystified , it 's been a struggle			0
there is one clue though - @entity9 is a migraine sufferer			1
she gets them , she says , around 10 times a month and so far , medics have been unable to find anything that gets rid of them completely			0
this could be important , as one of the few things known about @entity16 is that its linked to headaches and is thought to be a type of neurological brain damage			1
fellow sufferer , @entity83 , 52 , who also appears in the documentary , suffered severe headaches for years before a particularly bad migraine left her with a @entity5 accent in place of her habitual @entity91 tones			1
' up until i met @entity83 , i thought i was the only person in the world that this happened to , ' says @entity9 , sadly			2
' you feel so alone so when somebody pops up and says " actually , i have it " , you feel better			0
you think " they sound foreign and they have to deal with it in the same way as me " ' one of the world 's few experts in @entity16 , professor @entity104 , adds : ' there are some common threads that run through their stories			2
there 's a lot of frustration about " why me ? " and " why is nobody able to explain why this has happened to me ? " ' as yet , there is no cure for @entity16			2
sufferers can have voice therapy but at present , little more can be done			0
that has n't stopped @entity9 from looking			0
' you do n't even know who you are anymore , ' she says of the condition			0
' it 's like you 're trapped inside yourself			0
' the woman who woke up @entity13 , tuesday at 10.35 on @entity124			0
