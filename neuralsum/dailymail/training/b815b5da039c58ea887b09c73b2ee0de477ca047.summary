it was the shocking photograph that went viral on thursday			2
@entity1 cowered , half - naked , under the eaves on her roof as an intruder lurked , looking for her just yards away			1
now @entity1 has spoken to @entity5 about the terrifying ordeal and shared the photographs that she took as she desperately waited for rescue			1
the dramatic pictures show cops with their guns drawn moving in on the house in @entity13 , @entity14 as the disturbed transient searched for the horrified tv writer			1
@entity18 , 30 - who is still reeling from the home invasion on wednesday morning - told @entity5 : ' i felt like i was becoming the plot to a horror movie , it was terrifying , all my instincts told me i had to get out of there			1
' if the police had n't got there when they did , who knows what could have happened			2
i thought i might have to jump off the roof			1
my mind keeps playing over and over all the possible ways this could have played out			2
' @entity18 - who only moved in to the rented property three weeks ago - was fast asleep when the intruder first started scoping the house at 8.15am			2
the @entity66 was woken by someone jiggling the knob to her front door and knocking			2
she said : ' my bedroom is in the loft and there ’s a ladder coming up from near the front door so the sound woke me up			1
i looked at my phone and the few people it could have been had n't texted to say they were coming round			2
' i hesitated for a second and eventually i come down and look out of the window and see the guy walking away , he was talking to himself , it sounded like he was commenting on a car parked in the street			2
' @entity18 says that as a single woman she has learnt not to advertise the fact you 're home alone			1
' i was n't going to shout after him and ask him what he wanted			2
i just let him keep going , ' she said			0
shrugging off the visit @entity18 contemplated taking a shower ready for work – but instead she decided to go back to bed			0
' it ’s a worrying thought because the guy came back 15 minutes later and i could have been taking a shower , ' she said			0
' there 's no lock on the bathroom door and the window is way too small to climb through , he could have come straight in to get me			0
i would have been trapped like a scene in @entity104			0
' but luckily i was lazy that morning and decided to go back to bed to get a little more sleep			0
my laziness may have helped save my life			0
' @entity109 : @entity1 told @entity5 : ' there was six cops pointing their guns up at me and a helicopter overhead ... and i 'm stuck on a roof with no pants on , it was crazy ' cover : a police officer provides cover while @entity18 begins her descent from the roof into the arms of firefighters helping hand : authorities arrived just minutes after the terrifying photo was taken taken into custody : the man was eventually coaxed down by police			1
@entity131 ' bail has been set at $ 50,000 fifteen minutes the intruder was back and this time he meant business			1
he started ramming the door with his shoulder			0
' i looked down from my bedroom and could see the door buckling with every charge , ' said an animated @entity18			1
' it seemed relentless , this guy was going to carry on until he got in , i was scared			0
i called 911 and told them someone was trying to break in my house			0
' i was giving them my address when a big chunk of my door broke inwards and i saw the guy 's hand coming inside to unlock it			1
' @entity18 decided her best plan was to escape			0
her bedroom is in the eaves of the house meaning her windows are low down			1
she slid back the glass door of one of the windows and kicked the screen panel out			0
‘ i literally crawled through the window and as the intruder steps one foot in my house , i step one foot on the roof , ' she said			1
' but he did n't stop there			0
he came up the steps to my bedroom and as i ’m crawling around the roof i see his head pop out through the window			1
the next thing he ’s on the roof with me			1
' fortunately a passer - by had seen the intruder – since identified as mentally ill @entity131 aged 24 – kicking in @entity18 's front door			1
he flagged down a passing squad car and the officers descended on the property , their guns drawn screaming at the intruder to come down			0
the whole time @entity18 was on the phone to a 911 dispatcher			0
' the dispatcher tried to keep me calm , she kept saying " the police have an eye on the suspect , he 's on the roof , " i was like " i know , i 'm on the roof too mam , that 's the problem , " it was nerve - wracking			1
' police managed to coax @entity131 down off the roof after firefighters gave @entity18 a ladder on which she could climb to safety			1
amazingly @entity18 says the whole incident lasted as long as 30 minutes and she managed to take some photos as it all unfolded			1
' there was six cops pointing their guns up at me and a helicopter overhead , and a bunch of people are watching from the sidewalk , and i 'm stuck on a roof with no pants on , it was crazy , ' she said			1
' it was a weird sensation to feel like your life is in jeopardy and people are watching it , i was n't trying to be a @entity222 episode , i did n't want to die before the credits			2
' @entity18 says she 's happy to have escaped unscathed and owes her dramatic escape to her mom who works as a tv news anchor in @entity228			0
lucky escape : eye witness @entity230 told @entity5 : ' what is amazing is that i happened to see it and there just happened to be an @entity234 car right there			1
who knows what could have happened to that girl otherwise ' ' the one thing she would say a lot and remind me of a lot is the adage that you do n't ever let somebody take you to a second location			0
' you know , if someone is trying to kidnap you or carjack you , you need to escape now , you need to fight in the moment			0
' that was my instinct , do n't stay in the house and confront this guy , get as far away from him and this situation as possible			0
' by the time i saw the police cruiser approaching my house i heard him coming up to my bedroom			2
they arrived just in time			0
' @entity18 - who writes for tv and also had an acting role the 2012 @entity262 film sparkle – must now decide whether she still feels comfortable living in a neighborhood she ’s only called home for the last three weeks			2
' i just got staffed as a writer on a show which was a huge step up for me so i moved to @entity13 to be closer to the office			1
i wanted to live the dream and move by the beach			0
then this happened , it really sucks , i 'm not sure what to do next			0

@entity1 , 30 , said she felt like she was in ' the plot of a horror movie ' when disturbed @entity131 forced his way into her @entity13 home
