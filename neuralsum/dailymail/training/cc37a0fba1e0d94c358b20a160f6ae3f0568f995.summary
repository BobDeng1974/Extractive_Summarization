by @entity0 essential oils from cloves and oregano could be used to prolong the life of bread they are common in aromatherapy products and alternative cleaning fluids , but now essential oils from plants could also be used to prolong the life of bread			1
scientists have developed new edible films , containing oils from clove and oregano , that preserve the humble loaf longer than commercial compounds			1
essential oils are natural compounds that keep bacteria and mould at bay , according to a study published in @entity28 ' @entity27 @entity29 and her team from the @entity31 in @entity32 , set out to test how well different edible films with these essential oils could maintain bread 's freshness			1
to do this they took the essential oils - @entity38 from clove and @entity40 from oregano - and incorporated them as emulsions into water - soluble polymers to make their antimicrobial film			1
a chemical compound called methylcellulose was added for film - forming purposes			2
they wanted to study how they measured up against a commercial synthetic antimicrobial agent , which also prevents the growth of bacteria and mould			2
bread is a common staple around the world and is often kept fresh with calcium propionate			2
though naturally occurring , some research has suggested the ingredient has negative side effects , which have tarnished its popularity , leading experts to look for alternatives			0
researchers discovered that films made with @entity38 ( left ) and oregano ( right ) essential oils can maintain bread 's freshness and reduce the amount of mould and yeast that gathers on bread over 15 days the scientists bought preservative - free bread and placed slices in plastic bags with and without essential oil - infused edible films			1
to some slices , they added a commercial preservative containing calcium propionate			0
after 10 days , the calcium propionate additive lost its effectiveness , but the edible films made with small droplets of the oils continue to slow mould growth			1
the experts found that both essential oils reduced the counts of yeast and moulds growing on the slices of bread over 15 days			1
@entity96 droplets of the oil increased the effectiveness of the film 's antimicrobial properties			2
scientists say toast falls butter side down because it only has time to rotate half a somersault before landing last year scientists claimed to have solved the mystery of why a piece of toast always seems to fall buttered side down			0
they said that it is to do with the height of the table so that if a slice of bread topples off the edge , it only has time to perform a half - somersault before it hits the floor			0
as the side which has been buttered is naturally facing upwards , that ’s the side which ends up on the floor			0
to confirm the theory , food expert professor @entity121 and his team dropped 100 slices of toast from a table at @entity127			0
in 81 per cent of cases , the buttered side made contact with the floor			0
‘ our research shows that @entity135 really does exist when it comes to dropped toast , ' professor @entity121 said .			0

scientists from @entity32 used essential oils to prolong the life of sliced bread
they created an edible film from oils in cloves and oregano
when applied to bread , the films slowed the growth of mould over 15 days
it performed *significantly* better than the compounds currently used
