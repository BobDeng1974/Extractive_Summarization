bubbly : but @entity0 soon developed narcolepsy , suffering from terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain when @entity4 agreed to have her three - year - old daughter @entity0 vaccinated against swine flu , she believed she was doing the best to protect her from a life - threatening pandemic			1
in 2009 , all children under five were invited to be vaccinated in a nationwide scheme			1
fortunately , the much - feared 2009 - 2010 outbreak never reached the pandemic scale expected			2
but @entity4 is convinced that the vaccine against it has left @entity0 with severe narcolepsy			1
@entity0 is the youngest known person in the world to be diagnosed with the neurological condition , which causes sufferers to suddenly fall asleep during the day			1
@entity0 also had terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating @entity19 she is part of a protracted legal battle against the government for compensation for vaccine - related narcolepsy			1
last week , their case went to court on appeal			2
this wrangling has continued despite the fact the government ’s scientists admitted two years ago that the vaccine , @entity34 , could cause narcolepsy , having previously denied any link			2
in a statistical investigation , published in the @entity39 , they found children given the vaccine were 14 times more likely to have developed narcolepsy than unvaccinated children			2
@entity4 , 44 , a former @entity44 physiotherapist , thought she was playing safe when she had @entity0 vaccinated			1
doctors had suggested her daughter could be at particular risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition , laryngomalacia , which obstructs breathing			1
children normally grow out of it by three			0
‘ we took the swine flu risk seriously since @entity0 had only recently outgrown laryngomalacia , ’ says @entity4 , who also has a son , @entity55 , and another daughter , @entity57			1
@entity44 clinics administered more than 900,000 doses of @entity34 in 2009 and 2010			0
@entity0 ’s first troubling symptoms developed within two weeks			1
her sleep became disturbed , leaving her exhausted in the day			0
then she began to suffer from hallucinations at night , thinking there were demons in her bedroom			2
‘ the symptoms just got worse — she was n’t sleeping at night , and sleeping and crying all day , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ nearly every time i turned round in the day , she was asleep			0
‘ she was slurring her words			0
she could not walk in a straight line , she suffered excruciating leg pains			0
’ then she developed cataplexy , where she ’d become temporarily paralysed for seconds by emotional triggers such as happiness or surprise , though staying conscious			0
‘ her brother would say a joke and she would fall down , ’ says @entity4			1
within six months , @entity4 and her husband @entity80 , a professor of theology , were housebound caring for @entity0			1
she was taken to a children ’s hospital for what @entity4 calls ‘ a series of failed visits ’			1
initially , doctors thought she had a brain tumour , but after tests they ruled that out			0
‘ the doctors quickly wrote us off as an anxious mother and a pain - in - the - a * * * child			2
’ the family was being referred to a psychiatric unit when a locum doctor from @entity98 diagnosed narcolepsy , which normally appears at around the age of 15			1
doctors had suggested to @entity4 her daughter could be at risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition @entity4 spoke to a friend ’s cousin , who has narcolepsy			1
‘ they warned me that we probably would n’t get any help for it in @entity114 , but said @entity115 in @entity116 had the world ’s best expertise			2
i got in touch with them			0
’ based on blood samples sent by post , experts at the university confirmed the diagnosis			0
the acknowledged world expert in the condition , dr @entity126 , is the director of the university ’s @entity128			2
he is recognised for finding the cause of narcolepsy — the failure of special ‘ wakefulness ’ cells , called hypocretins , found in the brain ’s sleep centre			2
dr @entity126 has also identified a possible reason why the vaccine has caused narcolepsy : a part of the swine flu virus is similar to a part of the hypocretin cell			1
the @entity34 vaccine primes the immune system ’s ‘ killer ’ cells to attack this part of the swine flu virus			1
but in a minority of patients , the killer cells also mistakenly attack the hypocretin cells , thinking they are swine flu cells			1
the risk is confined to people with a susceptible genetic make - up , dr @entity126 wrote in the journal @entity159 in 2013 — with around 20 per cent of the @entity114 population having this gene profile			0
however , he ’s had to retract this article because the data could not be reproduced			0
but dr @entity126 believes another possible link is adjuvants in the vaccine			0
these chemicals stimulate the immune system to produce a more powerful reaction to the inactive virus in the vaccine			0
in the @entity173 , swine flu vaccines have not used adjuvants nor have they been linked with narcolepsy			1
dr @entity126 says : ‘ my opinion is that it was a combination of the adjuvants and the @entity178 [ swine flu ] virus particles in @entity34 that made it very nasty for narcolepsy			1
’ @entity183 ( @entity183 ) , the pharmaceutical company which made the vaccine , says 795 people across @entity114 have reported developing narcolepsy since its use began in 2009			1
convinced their daughter needed to be under dr @entity126 ’s care — who would provide the expensive drug therapy she needed for free — the family moved to @entity116 four years ago			2
experts at @entity115 in @entity116 confirmed @entity0 's diagnosis @entity0 began receiving @entity195 , a drug that helps with symptoms of narcolepsy , possibly by affecting chemical messengers in the brain			1
‘ a course of @entity195 costs £ 12,000 a year , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ some children in @entity203 receive it , depending on a postcode lottery			0
it was not available to us in @entity208			0
’ the drug treatment has been ‘ life - changing , ’ she says			2
@entity0 sleeps restfully at night for three hours at a time			1
rarely does she experience hallucinations			0
her sleep in the day is condensed to two naps , she no longer collapses when she is happy nor does she slur or wobble when walking			0
while the government acknowledges @entity34 can cause narcolepsy , it has decided the condition does n’t make people more than 60 per cent disabled , which is the threshold for compensation for any jab under the @entity222 run by the @entity223			2
the scheme was set up to provide a clear , non-adversarial way of compensating people for damage from mass vaccination campaigns , meaning the government , not the manufacturer , ultimately foots the bill			0
a spokesman says : ‘ decisions on claims take into account the individual circumstances of each case and the latest available medical evidence			0
to date , no payment has been made in respect of immunisation against swine flu			1
’ @entity4 says this attitude is born out of ignorance : ‘ the condition has destroyed about 70 million neurons within @entity0 ’s brain ’s sleep centre			1
’ over the past four years , the scheme has not paid out anything			0
however , the @entity251 ( @entity251 ) says that between 2009 and 2014 , it received 191 reports of the @entity34 vaccine allegedly causing narcolepsy and related conditions			2
likewise , no payouts have been made to young girls who have apparently suffered damage from the hpv vaccine campaign against cervical cancer — despite the fact that , according to the @entity251 , more than 300 schoolgirls a year are reporting serious side effects			0
@entity4 ’s lawyers , @entity265 , have 68 people in a narcolepsy class action — two - thirds were children when vaccinated			1
lawyer @entity269 has been pursuing the cases with the @entity271			0
‘ the @entity223 ( @entity223 ) initially refused our application because it would not accept there was a link between @entity34 and narcolepsy , ’ he says			2
this was before the publication of the @entity39 study			0
‘ now they are saying narcolepsy is not a severe disability and does not qualify for compensation			2
’ @entity0 's drug treatment has been ' life - changing ' and she sleeps restfully at night for three hours at a time after a court ruled that the patients could be compensated , a @entity223 appeal reversed this			1
last week mr @entity269 took an appeal against this ruling to a higher tribunal			0
he is also pursuing @entity183 on the grounds not of negligence , but under consumer protection law that the product was n’t as safe as consumers could expect			0
@entity4 stresses she is not anti-vaccine			1
‘ the problem is how the government is dealing with the consequences of @entity34			0
’ this is echoed by @entity301 of the charity narcolepsy @entity203			2
‘ vaccination campaigns only work if sufficient people volunteer for them , ’ he says			0
‘ anyone who suffers damage from doing something for the good of society should surely be looked after by society			0
’ a @entity183 spokesman told us : ‘ while those vaccinated with @entity34 have been shown in several published studies to be more likely to develop narcolepsy than those who were not , further research is needed to confirm what role the vaccine may have played in the development of narcolepsy among those affected			1
‘ @entity34 went through a rigorous approval process			0
throughout the development of our pandemic vaccines there were no data to suggest a potential for an increased risk of narcolepsy among those vaccinated			1
‘ we continue to support ongoing work from other experts and organisations investigating reported cases of this condition			0
’ the universal use of @entity34 in those aged under 20 was stopped in @entity203 in 2011			0
