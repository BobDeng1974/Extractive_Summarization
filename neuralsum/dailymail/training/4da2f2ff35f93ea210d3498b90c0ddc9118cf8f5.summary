winds of change : a turbine @entity2 is preparing to offer tax breaks to firms hit by @entity6 ’s ‘ absurd ’ climate change policies after being warned they threaten to drive business abroad			1
in a major u-turn , the chancellor will try to help companies that use large amounts of energy			1
his move comes amid growing concern that companies and households are being hit heavily by @entity6 ’s commitment to cut carbon emissions faster than other countries			1
yesterday one of the world ’s leading industrialists said manufacturing was being ‘ ruinously penalised ’ by green taxes and said the levies could put his firm ’s £ 1.2billion investment programme in this country at risk			1
@entity31 , head of @entity32 – which employs 20,000 staff in @entity6 – told the @entity35 : ‘ why the @entity6 government wants to go further and be the leader in @entity38 in this field is difficult for me to understand			0
it ’s a race for the leadership that is simply over the top			0
‘ the @entity6 is one of the weaker industrial players in @entity38			0
why are we trying to be a leader on the green front when the economy is in such a hard place ? ’ he added : ‘ if the @entity6 becomes less attractive due to regulation and tax , then there are other places in the world to invest			1
the government must see that			0
’ mr @entity2 ’s plans are sure to set him on collision course with his @entity60 coalition colleagues			1
last night @entity62 sources told the @entity35 the chancellor is working on radical proposals to mitigate the effects on companies that use large amounts of energy , such as cement , aluminium and steel makers			1
tax breaks and exemptions from new carbon levies are expected to be included in a mini-budget due next month			1
@entity2 is preparing to offer tax breaks to firms hit by climate change policies ( pictured during @entity79 conference this month ) a source close to mr @entity2 said : ‘ we recognise that a decade of environmental laws and regulations have piled costs on the energy bills of energy intensive business			1
‘ as well as increasing the climate change levy discount on electricity and reducing corporation tax , he will be announcing a package of measures to help energy intensive industries remain competitive in due course			1
‘ there ’s no point forcing energy intensive industries to relocate to other countries – that would only harm our economy without reducing global carbon emissions			1
’ last year @entity102 said he wanted the @entity103 to be known as the ‘ greenest government ever ’			1
and mr @entity2 alarmed industry when he announced a ‘ carbon floor price ’ in his budget last march – essentially a tax on emissions that will raise £ 3.2billion by 2016			1
former conservative chancellor @entity110 , a leading climate change sceptic , said tax breaks for the hardest - hit industries were a good ‘ first step ’			1
the current policies are endangering the economy at a particularly difficult time , ’ he said			0
‘ i hope the chancellor will as soon as possible spell out exactly what he proposes to do to prevent this			0
‘ the real need is not to have these absurd commitments and then have to run around bribing vulnerable businesses at taxpayers ’ expense so as to prevent them from closing down or leaving the country – it is to amend the [ emissions ] targets			0
‘ we must make it quite clear that we are not going there if the rest of the world is n’t			0
’ under @entity138 ’s @entity137 , the government is legally bound to cut emissions 35 per cent by 2022 and 50 per cent by 2025			1
but the @entity140 is committed only to cutting emissions 20 per cent by 2020			0
several countries are rejecting calls for them to increase the target to 30 per cent			0
@entity79 mp @entity145 , a former leadership contender , said : ‘ @entity2 must stand his ground against the @entity60 on this issue			2
‘ there is absolutely no point in having such draconian environmental policies that heavy energy - using industries like steel and chemicals up sticks and go and create just as much pollution in @entity156 and @entity157 , but to our economic disadvantage			2
it is simply not a rational policy			0
’ energy secretary @entity162 said it was vital for @entity6 to reduce its dependence on oil and gas imports from ‘ volatile ’ parts of the world			2
he said volatility in fossil fuel prices was primarily responsible for pushing up household bills			2
ministers ’ obsession with green taxes is driving up energy bills , bringing financial pain to millions of families , it was claimed last night			1
business groups demanded cuts in fuel prices be given a higher priority than meeting @entity140 targets to reduce carbon emissions			2
but the @entity136 energy summit yesterday offered no hope that struggling families and businesses will be offered lower energy bills this winter			1
both energy secretary @entity162 and @entity6 gas managing director @entity191 admitted that price rises were here to stay			2
the ‘ big six ’ energy giants have increased tariffs by 15 per cent - plus in recent weeks , raising the average annual dual fuel bill by around £ 175 to £ 1,345			2
this figure is inflated by around £ 100 to cover a raft of green taxes and associated charges , which are set to soar in the next decade			1
mr @entity162 is the chief cheerleader for the charges , which are being used to fund a £ 200billion shift to wind , wave , solar and nuclear power			2
yesterday he insisted that prices in @entity6 were ‘ relatively good ’ compared with elsewhere in the world but admitted : ‘ if you are asking me to predict what is going to happen to world fossil fuel prices then the government ’s prediction ... is that in the medium - run those prices are going to go up			0
the companies are not the @entity213			2
we expect them to earn respectable returns for their shareholders			0
’ mr @entity191 added : ‘ in the last two and a half years , gas prices on the international market are up by 70 per cent			0
i ’m afraid it is an inconvenient truth that those costs have to be passed on to customers			0
’ mr @entity162 said customers should shop around as up to 85 per cent ‘ do n’t bother ’ to look for a better deal			0
he said : ‘ this is not small beer			0
if you look at the figures on an average dual fuel bill of about £ 1,300 , by switching you can get £ 200 off			1
’ but yesterday @entity229 , the new director general of the @entity230 , said it was ‘ simply not credible ’ for the government politely to ask energy firms to curb bills			2
he warned that the current push for green energy is driving up bills , saying : ‘ current policies risk locking us into cleaner and more expensive energy , when the goal should be cleaner and cheaper energy			1
‘ what may have been tolerable in an age of affluence is far less realistic today			0
undermining the @entity6 ’s competitiveness through high energy costs would do no favours to either economic recovery or the environment			2
’ @entity250 , of consumer champion which ? , said : ‘ there is a problem here that has got to be fixed			0
the market does , for consumers , feel rigged against us			0
’ @entity260 , of price comparison website @entity258 , said : ‘ i would urge the government to calculate the full cost that will be passed on to household energy bills and to then think again about the impact			1
’ energy industry analyst dr @entity265 said : ‘ i think the summit has come too late in the year to have any effect on bills this winter			1
this appears to be a cosmetic exercise at least in terms of any immediate impact			0
’ @entity274 , managing director of @entity276 energy , said he thought the meeting was ‘ disappointingly predictable ’ , adding : ‘ if i was the head of one of the big six i would feel that we had got off very lightly			0
