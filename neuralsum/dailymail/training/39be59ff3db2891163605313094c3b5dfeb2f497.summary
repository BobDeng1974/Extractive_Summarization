the @entity2 government 's accumulated debts have grown by more than $ 7 trillion – with a ' t ' – since @entity3 became president on january 20 , 2009			1
the sad milestone was revealed on july 31 by the @entity2 @entity6 on a ' debt to the penny ' website that calculates the debt at the end of every business day			1
on @entity3 's first day in office the debt stood at $ 10.626 trillion			1
last thursday it reached $ 17.687 trillion			0
@entity3 has duplicated that dubious achievement in less than five years and seven months			2
after the same number of days in office , former president @entity31 had increased the national debt by a comparatively paltry $ 2.720 trillion			1
@entity36 's debt load at the same point in his presidency had increased by just $ 1,324 trillion			2
the right - leaning @entity39 was first to point out that @entity3 had cleared the $ 7 trillion hurdle in added financial obligations			1
during a july 2008 campaign speech in @entity43 , then - senator @entity3 ripped into the @entity31 administration for running up the federal debt by a total of $ 4 billion near the end of his second term			1
' the problem is , ' he said , ' is that the way @entity31 has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the @entity53 in the name of our children , driving up our national debt from $ 5 trillion for the first 42 presidents – # 43 added $ 4 trillion by his lonesome , so that we now have over $ 9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back – $ 30,000 for every man , woman and child			2
' ' that ’s irresponsible , ' @entity3 said then			0
' the @entity66 ripped into the president on monday with an email blast charging that after ' [ i ] gnoring warnings from all corners , @entity3 has one of the worst records on the federal debt in @entity2 history			1
' the @entity24 did n't immediately respond to a request for a response			0
in february the nonpartisan @entity77 estimated that ' federal debt held by the public will equal 74 percent of gdp at the end of this year and 79 percent in 2024			0
' at the end of 2008 , that number was just 39 per cent			0
at current rates of spending , by 2019 the debt will be larger than the nation 's annual gdp			0
contrast : in their combined 12 years in office , the two presidents @entity31 added a total of $ 7.4 trillion to the national debt -- a number @entity3 will equal after six years ' such large and growing federal debt , ' the @entity77 warns , ' could have serious negative consequences , including restraining economic growth in the long term , giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges , and eventually increasing the risk of a fiscal crisis			1
' debt held by the public makes up about 71 per cent of the total federal debt			1
the rest consists of ' intragovernmental holdings ' – government - speak for gaps in the @entity110 , the @entity111 , and other revolving funds			0
those lines on @entity117 's balance sheet totaled $ 5,036 trillion at the end of last thursday , a number that represents how far behind the government is in meeting its long - term obligations to retirees and other benefit - takers			0
government spending has skyrocketed during @entity3 's time in office due to a combinations of his policies , a spendthrift @entity127 and recession - related automatic stabilizers like unemployment insurance that can quickly drain the @entity6			2
the annual deficit – a single year 's addition to the larger debt – was $ 1.413 trillion in 2009 , @entity3 's first year in the @entity24			2
he has steadily reduced it year - on - year , and the 2014 deficit is expected to be $ 492 billion			0
that number , however , is still larger than any other annual deficit in the history of the @entity2 before he became president .			0

total federal government debt has increased by 66 per cent since @entity3 became president
*stunning* milestone is revealed by @entity6 website that discloses *burgeoning* numbers at the end of every business day
it took more than 223 years for the @entity2 to accumulate its first $ 7 trillion in debt
@entity3 has repeated the *depressing* feat in less than *67* months
