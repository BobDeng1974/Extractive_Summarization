an @entity1 woman raped by her cousin ’s husband has revealed how she is faced with a horrific dilemma – marry him or spend the next 12 years in jail			1
@entity6 was aged just 19 when she was convicted by a court of adultery , even though she tried to prevent the attack			1
now she is in @entity12 's @entity11 jail , serving out her sentence with her rapist ’s child			1
and , even more incredibly , she is willing to			1
dressed in a veil , with her baby in her lap , @entity6 explained how it was the only way out of jail , and the only way around the dishonour of having sex outside marriage			1
she recalls the day that changed her life two years ago , which began her long nightmare			1
despite new laws being brought in , @entity1 officials are not bothering to prosecute rape cases and beatings suffered by women			2
indictments were filed on just 155 occasions following an estimated 2,299 incidents of violence against women			2
women had few rights under the harsh rule of the @entity50 , who were ousted in 2001 , and an improvement in the lot of women has been a top priority of @entity57 backers of the government of president @entity59			2
but despite reform , the elimination of @entity62 law is not being used			2
missed cases that could of being prosecuted under the rules include that of two sisters , 15 and 17 , who were killed in western @entity68 province in july 2010 after the elder teenager refused to marry an older man			1
the future husband and father - in - law were sentenced to 16 years in prison , while three other people were acquitted			1
in central @entity77 province , a prosecutor used the law to challenge a verdict by a court that found two girls impregnated by a 60 - year - old religious leader guilty of adultery			1
an appeals court rejected that challenge , the @entity85 mission said			2
a woman in southern @entity90 province complained in march of her daughter 's forced suicide			2
she said the girl , who had been sold into marriage for $ 6,600 , set herself on fire in her room when , after 10 years of the marriage , her in - laws forced her to have sex with three male guests visiting the family			1
her assailant arrived at the house when her mother left for a brief visit to the hospital			2
‘ he had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work , ’ she told @entity107 in an exclusive interview			2
‘ he closed doors and windows			0
i started screaming , but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth , ’ she said			0
after the attack , she hid what happened as long as she could			0
but soon she began showing the signs of morning sickness			0
she received not sympathy but prosecution			0
but she appreciates she is lucky to get a second chance			0
many women in her position have been killed , for the shame such incidents bring on the community			0
now , if she marries her attacker she has a chance to restore her honour and to give her child a family			1
‘ i was asked if i wanted to start a new life by getting released , by marrying this man ’			0
she added : ‘ my daughter is a little innocent child			0
who knew i would have a child in this way			0
a lot of people told me that after your daughter 's born give it to someone else , but my aunt told me to keep her as proof of my innocence			0
' @entity107 tracked down @entity6 's rapist in a jail across town			1
he denied raping her , but agreed that she would be a likely target if she got out of jail			1
he insists that it will be her family , not his , that will kill her			0
but @entity6 's plight has found international attention			1
the @entity160 part - funded the team of documentary makers who interviewed her and other women facing a similar plight but have decided to spike the project after watching it			0
the @entity160 said it was concerned about the safety of the women in the film , saying they could be subject to reprisals			0
the film - makers however suspect that the @entity160 might also be motivated by its sensitive relationship with @entity1 justice institutions .			0

@entity6 was convicted of adultery because she had sex outside of marriage by being raped
after falling pregnant by her attacker , she and the baby were jailed for 12 years
she has been given the choice to marry her rapist and be freed from jail
