some traditions are carried through the ages , but others are neatly dropped , such as the presence of the home secretary at the royal birth to ensure the true heir was not replaced with a usurper			1
here we chart the extraordinary changes in how the royals have arrived into the world over the centuries			1
prince @entity13 on the evening of november 14 , 1948 , prince @entity13 was born in @entity15 ’s @entity14			1
the queen mother with the then princess @entity17 , aged eight months , ( pictured left ) before anyone thought she might one day be @entity16			1
right , princess @entity17 with baby prince @entity13 at his christening at @entity15 in december 1948 it had been transformed into a temporary maternity ward for the birth , and was later used for the arrivals of prince @entity25 and @entity26			1
it had been a long and arduous birth and our @entity16 - to - be had endured 30 hours in labour			2
prince @entity31 spent some of the time smashing his way round a squash court with athletic vigour			1
he was , in fact , a nervous expectant father , and after the game went for a swim in the @entity15 pool			0
as he was drying himself , a footman hurried in with the news of the birth			0
prince @entity45 : prince @entity13 and @entity17 leaving @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , less than 24 hours after the birth of the infant when the @entity17 came round from her anaesthetic , the @entity31 was there with a bottle of champagne and a large bouquet of red roses and carnations , the @entity16 ’s favourite flowers , that his equerry had the foresight to buy earlier			1
while it used to be traditional for the home secretary to be in attendance in adjoining rooms to witness the birth of the heir to the throne , the custom was dispensed with for @entity13			0
indeed , it was the first time since the 18th century that there was no government minister present			2
the queen - to - be was struck by the size of baby @entity13 ’s hands			1
‘ they are rather large , but fine with long fingers — quite unlike mine and certainly unlike his father ’s , ’ she later wrote			1
‘ it will be interesting to see what they will become			2
’ celebrate : people in festive mood outside @entity46 while hundreds of royal baby - watchers , journalists and photographers waited outside in anticipation of the royal birth touchingly , she added : ‘ i still find it difficult to believe that i have a baby of my own			1
’ prince @entity31 was characteristically blunt when asked what the future @entity90 looked like			1
he replied : ‘ a plum pudding			2
’ meanwhile , outside the @entity15 the crowds shouted : ‘ we want @entity31 ! ’ but , he did n’t come out and instead they sang lullabies			1
it was a welcome boost to the morale of post-war @entity97			0
as is customary , the lights in @entity100 fountain were changed to blue to signal a boy , and troops in ceremonial dress fired salutes amid the peals of bells from @entity108 and @entity109 ’s			0
the queen the @entity16 was the first @entity97 monarch since the @entity111 to be born in a private house rather than a palace or castle			2
she was delivered by caesarean section at 17 @entity116 , the @entity117 home of her maternal grandparents , the @entity119 and @entity120			0
crowds of people try to look at the notice formally announcing the birth of a son to prince @entity45 and @entity126 , @entity127 at that point , she was third in line to the throne , after her uncle and father , and was expected to be pushed further down the line of succession as more male heirs were born			2
how wrong those expectations were to prove			0
the @entity16 was born at 2.40am on april 21 , 1926 , after the @entity137 had been in labour for 24 hours			0
as was customary for the birth of anyone in the direct line of succession , the home secretary — then sir @entity139 — was present at the birth to ensure the true heir was not replaced with a usurper			0
at the time , the government was embroiled in an industrial dispute with the coal miners			0
the first @entity97 general strike was just days away and , in some quarters , there was even talk of revolution			0
while @entity17 ’s grandfather @entity154 did not usually get on with children , the @entity17 was to prove his match and he took to calling her @entity157 and even allowed her to tug at his beard			1
prince @entity45 @entity17 , the @entity17 , broke with tradition by choosing to have her baby in hospital rather than a palace or castle			1
like the @entity127 , she opted for the private @entity164 of @entity46 in @entity47			0
on 21 june , 1982 , she gave birth to prince @entity45			2
at first , she stuck with a natural childbirth , but after a few hours in labour she changed her mind and had an epidural to ease the pain			2
she later remarked : ‘ if men had babies , they would only have one each			2
’ people take pictures outside @entity46 in @entity48 , @entity97 , 22 july 2013 and emailing them to friends around the world @entity17 originally wanted to call her first - born @entity178 , but prince @entity13 was said to have been wary of anything that smacked of @entity180			1
@entity13 suggested @entity181 , but they eventually settled on @entity45			0
after the birth , @entity13 presented her with a necklace of diamonds and pearls with a sparkling heart at the centre			0
he also bought her a solid gold ‘ w ’ to add to her charm bracelet as well as a custom - built , apple - green @entity190 with enough space in the boot for a travel cot			1
when the @entity16 saw her first grandson , she said : ‘ thank @entity197 he does n’t have his father ’s ears			2
’ unusual births prince @entity31 arrived on a kitchen table in a rented summer villa called ‘ @entity203 ’ in @entity204			1
the house had no electricity , hot water or plumbing as @entity31 ’s family was destitute , despite being members of the @entity212 royal family			1
eighteen months later , the family left for @entity214 , with @entity31 travelling in a carry cot made from an old orange box			1
there has always been an element of intrigue about the birth of the @entity137			0
it is not precisely known where she was born on august 4 , 1900			0
some say she was born in the back of an ambulance , but it is more likely to have been at her parents ’ townhouse in @entity230 , in @entity48 ’s @entity117			2
the legal requirement to register the birth does not appear to have been paramount in the mind of her father , lord @entity120			0
the 42 days allowed for registration had long passed when he strode into the register office on september 21			0
he was fined for registering the birth late — and appears to have entered the wrong place of birth on her birth certificate			0
while he said it was at the family home , @entity247 , in @entity248 , both she and her passport stated she was born in @entity48			0
not all royals are delivered into this world in sumptuous surroundings			0
in the 13th century , @entity252 , the first wife of @entity253 , gave birth to the future @entity256 in little more than a building site — a tiny , damp , windowless den in what was , to all intents and purposes , a half - finished @entity262 in @entity263 , later the scene of @entity13 ’s investiture as @entity266			1
@entity267 , consort of @entity269 , gave birth in a basement in @entity108 ’s grounds , after her husband was removed from the throne and forced into exile			0
royal gossips until the middle of the 17th century , royal childbirth was a strictly women - only affair overseen by midwives , ladies - in - waiting , nurses - in - waiting , wet nurses , dry nurses , laundresses and rockers of the royal cradle			1
as royal historian @entity289 writes in her new book , the @entity291 , this gang of women were known as @entity197 ’s siblings — or @entity197 ’s sibs — which is where the word ‘ gossip ’ comes from			1
@entity298 was one of the first royals to break this tradition			2
he was present at @entity302 ’s labours , and she gratefully wrote of him : ‘ there could be no kinder , wiser , nor more judicious nurse			2
’ captain @entity305 was present when @entity306 gave birth to their son @entity308 in 1977			2
the experience , he commented afterwards , was ‘ not everyone ’s cup of tea ’			1
agony and ecstasy queen @entity302 was at the forefront of the campaign to make pain - relief during labour acceptable			2
one hundred and fifty years ago , it was expected that childbirth would and indeed should be agony			0
after all , the @entity323 says : ‘ to the woman @entity197 said : “ in pain you will give birth to children			0
” ’ but by baby number eight , @entity302 had had enough			1
for the birth of @entity331 she employed a @entity333 doctor @entity332 , who was a pioneer of the use of chloroform as an anaesthetic			0
‘ oh , that blessed chloroform , ’ she wrote afterwards , ‘ soothing and delightful beyond measure			1
’ protests against the painkiller were staged on religious and medical grounds , but the procedure gained popularity and became known as ‘ @entity346 ’			1
counting the hours in the records of royal labour - lengths , the award for quickest birth goes to princess @entity351 , born to @entity352 and @entity353 in 1768			1
the whole thing took 90 minutes from start to finish			0
the slowest royal birth was that of the future @entity358 , son of @entity359 and @entity360			0
he took three days to emerge			0
a large procession took place in @entity48 during this time to pray for the @entity16 ’s deliverance from a difficult labour			0
weighty matters the smallest royal baby seems to have been @entity367 , the eldest son of the future @entity369 he was born two months premature on january 8 , 1864 , weighing 3lb 3oz — considerably lighter than @entity45 and @entity127 ’s 8lb 6oz arrival yesterday .			1
