the figures @entity21 referred to during his speech aimed at parents are from @entity4 's new ' @entity24 ' and ' @entity25 - both of which feature ghoulish , ashen - faced characters he claims have more in common with @entity27 - than traditional plastic bricks			1
' evil ' : father @entity10 said @entity4 's new ' @entity24 ' range is ' about darkness and the world of death ' and could destroy the souls of children and ' lead them to the dark side ' describing the @entity4 characters ' change in appearence to wear torn clothes that are covered in blood , @entity21 said : ' friendly fellows have been replaced by dark monsters ... these toys can have a negative effect on children			1

' ' facial expressions may be lead to confusion between good and evil , ' he added			0
father @entity10 went on to cite research by @entity56 's @entity55 that @entity4 characters ' faces have become angrier over the years , @entity52 reported			1
