he said : ' we 've been in touch with the @entity3 to ask what is happening with @entity2 because of what he said			2
' it 's up to the particular authorities concerned about what they do now because it 's not in our jurisdiction and not up to us to offer advice			0
' but we are unhappy when they come out and accuse one of our players of cheating			0
' we do n't believe that is justified in any shape or form			0
the player was caught , and then he went down			0
' the @entity3 are currenlty investigating @entity8 's criticism of referee @entity9 during his side 's 2 - 1 loss @entity45 understands that @entity14 ' complaint will have little to no impact on the ongoing @entity3 investigation , which is centred on @entity2 's comments about @entity9 rather than those said against @entity6			1

@entity8 is this week likely to be contacted by referees chief @entity53 , who was also criticised by the @entity5 manager at the weekend			1

' i think it is about being pro-active and he is clearly not doing that - he is clearly not listening to anything i am saying			0
( @entity53 's ) job is to ring me - it 's not mine to ring him			0
he is supposed to be the head of these guys and overseeing it all , and seeing what managers feel			0
' but i 've had no contact whatsoever , and for me , that is very poor			0

@entity5 boss @entity2 said @entity0 's @entity6 should be ' ashamed of himself ' after penalty decision
