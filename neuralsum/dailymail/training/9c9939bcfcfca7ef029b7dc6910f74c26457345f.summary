by @entity1 reporter published : 09:38 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 18:17 est , 18 february 2013 the biggest snake captured during the month - long ' @entity3 ' in @entity4 is to be released back into the wild			1
in total , three pythons are going to be let back out into the @entity8 , each equipped with two transmitters			1
officials hope that these trick snakes will direct them to thousands of pythons hiding in the swamps and , most importantly , to breeding females			1
' it 's breeding time and females attract males and we have three eager young lads sitting out there with radio transmitters on them who can lead us to the breeding female and we can catch her , ' @entity25 , wildlife professor and organizer of the competition , told @entity29			1
no one is quite sure how many of the non-native species live in the @entity8 but estimates have ranged up to 100,000 animals			1
though the final body count for the @entity3 was fairly small , organizers say they were very happy with the outcome of the hunt			1
' thanks to the determination of @entity3 competitors , we are able to gather invaluable information that will help refine and focus combined efforts to control pythons in the @entity8 , ' @entity4 wildlife commission executive director @entity52 told @entity60			1
as well as culling @entity4 â€™s population of the invasive snakes , the purpose of the hunt was also to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem			1
the pythons can grow up to 18 feet in length , but finding the camouflaged pythons in @entity4 's swampland was n't easy			2
' you can go out there for days and days and days and not see one python , ' hunter @entity72 told @entity60 last month			2
' i do n't care how much experience you have			0
it is going to take some luck			0
' officials said that challenge competitors had covered a million acres of swamp , brush and sawgrass			0
but these efforts were n't without rewards for the proud winners			0
@entity89 of @entity90 , @entity4 , won a $ 1,500 grand prize in the amateur category for killing six pythons			2
in the professional category , @entity94 of @entity95 won the same amount for notching up 18 snakes			2
@entity99 , also from @entity4 , took home $ 1,000 for bagging the longest python ( which was later realeased ) , which measured 14 feet , 3 inches			0
captain @entity101 , of @entity104 's @entity103 unit , explains the infestation problem to the media with the help of an 85 - pound python two young men who became ' stranded and disoriented ' while taking part in the hunt were rescued on february 7 by police piloting a chopper			2
the @entity114 said units responded to a call about the missing men at about 4 p.m. air rescue units began a search of the area , and the hunters were found a half - hour later			1
a helicopter landed in the @entity8 and transported the two men to rescue units a few miles away			1
the victims , ages 22 and 25 , ' complained of lightheadedness and weakness and were suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration , ' according to the news release from the sheriff 's office			0
firefighters were told they were from @entity134			0
the men , who have not been identified , were treated at the scene and declined to be transported to a hospital			0
hunters were restricted to four state wildlife management areas ; @entity140 was off - limits			1
they were allowed to use some firearms , as well as captive bolts and machetes to kill the pythons			2
@entity4 state offered cash prizes to whoever brought in the longest python and whoever killed the most snakes captain @entity101 displays a python during the kick - off ceremonies in january			1
this 13 - foot snake was captured a year ago swimming in a backyard pool before the start of the hunt in january , dozens of would - be python hunters showed up for some last - minute training in snake handling at the @entity161			1
the training came down to common sense : drink water , wear sunscreen , do n't get bitten by anything and do n't shoot anyone			0
many of the onlookers were dressed in camouflage , though they probably did n't have to worry about spooking the snakes			2
they would have a much harder time spotting the splotchy , tan pythons in the long green grasses and woody brush of the @entity8			1
' it 's advantage - snake , ' mechanical engineer @entity175 concluded after slashing his way through a quarter - mile of scratchy sawgrass , dried leaves and woody overgrowth near a campsite in the @entity37 , which is about 50 miles southeast of @entity182 and is supervised by the @entity183			0
@entity175 , of @entity184 , and friend @entity185 of @entity186 , a statistician in computer security , holstered large knives and pistols on their hips , so they 'd be ready for any python that crossed their path			0
@entity175 battles through thick brush in search for @entity32 pythons , also described as the ' zombies of the @entity8 ' the most useful tool they had , though , was the key fob to their car			1
@entity185 wanted to know that they had n't wandered too far into the wilderness , so @entity175 clicked the fob until a reassuring beep from their car chirped softly through the brush			0
the recommended method for killing pythons is the same for killing zombies : a gunshot to the brain , or decapitation to reduce the threat			0
( @entity214 does n't approve of the latter method , though			0
) pythons are kind of the zombies of the @entity8 , though their infestation is less deadly to humans			1
the snakes have no natural predators , they can eat anything in their way , they can reproduce in large numbers and they do n't belong here			0
@entity4 currently prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets , and federal law bans the importation and interstate sale of the species			2
wildlife experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg			2
@entity4 is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than anywhere else in the world , said @entity246 , dean of research for the @entity161 's @entity248			0
careful lookout : another hunter , @entity250 , uses a golf cart as he searches for snakes with his son roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in @entity4 since 2000 , according to the conservation commission			2
it 's unknown exactly how many are slithering through the wetlands			0
officials hope the competition will help rid the @entity8 of the invaders while raising awareness about the risks that exotic species pose to @entity4 's native wildlife			1
@entity175 and @entity185 emerged from the @entity8 empty - handed , but they planned to return the next day , hoping for cooler temperatures that would drive heat - seeking snakes into sunny patches along roads and levees			1
@entity185 still deemed the hunt a success			0
' for me , i take back to my friends and community that there is a beautiful environment out here			0
it 's opening the picture from just the python issue to the issue of how do we protect our environment , ' she said			0
on the trail : @entity175 ( right ) and @entity185 ( left ) head into the @entity8 in the search of pythons			1

around 1,600 people *signed* up in the hope of prizes in ' @entity3 '
only 68 animals caught during month - long competition
up to 100,000 snakes estimated to have invaded @entity8 region and they are thought to menace native species
now three pythons equipped with *trackers* will be released back into wild to direct hunters to breeding females
