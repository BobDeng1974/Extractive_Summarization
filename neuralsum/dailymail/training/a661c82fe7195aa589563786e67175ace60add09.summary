ratings by @entity86 at the emirates @entity30 , a second half substitute , scored @entity32 ’s dramatic equaliser when he headed beyond @entity10 keeper @entity41			1
it was incredible to witness			0
‘ clueless , ’ was the brutal assessment of former @entity10 forward @entity91 , sitting in the tv studio , when he was asked about @entity56 ’s role in this capitulation			2
the @entity96 know of no other way to play			2
they will never learn , that much is clear			0
‘ they tried to score a fourth and at 3 - 2 you see @entity10 start to have a bit of doubt , ’ declared @entity32 coach @entity99			1
he and @entity56 did not shake hands at the final whistle because @entity78 was too busy cavorting on the pitch with his wild - eyed players tearing off those fetching purple shirts			0
‘ it does n’t hurt me if i do n't get his hand			0
we come from a small competition and we can only imagine playing these teams			0
maybe @entity10 wanted to have fun with their public			2
’ @entity10 were booed off at the final whistle by their increasingly frustrated supporters and it was tempting to join in with them			2
‘ it was a poor defensive performance , ’ admitted @entity56			0
‘ at 3 - 0 we thought the job was done			1
we got punished , we under - estimated @entity32 sub-consciously			2
to be this far ahead , thanks to goals from @entity45 , @entity21 and @entity48 , and press the self - destruct button really is something else			1
‘ we threw everything away , ’ admitted @entity45 , who has torn his hamstring and will miss sunday ’s trip to @entity128			2
‘ this is not the standard required			0
’ after @entity133 scrambled @entity32 ’s opening goal , the gods were with the @entity136 champions			1
@entity78 ’s side , battered in the opening 45 minutes , played on the nerves and anxiety that transmits into the stands whenever @entity10 concede a soft goal			2
whatever training drills this defence does - if any - during the week will have to be revisited after this implosion			0
they remain second in @entity147 , but suddenly the home game against @entity149 ( hopeless in the @entity150 , different class in @entity8 ) and the trip to @entity153 have a menacing air about them			0
from 3 - 0 up after 58 minutes at the @entity1 there is an outside chance they will fail to qualify for the second stage for the first time in 15 years			1
to the first half , then			0
@entity21 , this dreamy no 10 in @entity10 colours , ran the show for the home team			2
@entity49 is bundled over by @entity32 defender @entity166 in the box to gift a penalty to @entity10 @entity10 captain @entity45 cheekily dinks his penalty over @entity59 to give @entity10 the lead @entity59 dives to his right as the ball sails over him and in to the roof of the @entity32 net @entity45 wheels away in celebration after putting @entity10 in the driving seat midway through the first half as @entity10 blew their lead , fan @entity178 made this plea to @entity182 defender @entity181 ...			1
@entity178 : if i pay you £ 50m will you play for us ? @entity186 : great club but no. @entity178 : £ 60m & 2 @entity188 ? @entity186 : those days have gone , i play for glory			0
:-) the delay on the reverse pass into the penalty area for @entity49 to run on to in that move that led to @entity10 ’s opening goal was reminiscent of the late , great @entity196			2
@entity166 cut across @entity49 , getting all tangled up inside the area as he attempted to hold off the @entity10 striker and bundled him over			2
@entity45 scored easily and it seemed fitting that the captain of the team should be responsible for the 500th goal scored by @entity10 since their move to the @entity1 in 2006			1
they pressed the accelerator again			0
@entity21 scored their second in the 29th minute after he was knocked to the ground just outside the area by @entity79			1
he immediately took responsibility for the free - kick , reacting first when it cannoned off the wall to pick it out of the night sky and drive a low volley beyond the @entity32 keeper			2
that was 2 - 0 and @entity48 added a third when he raced clear and beat @entity59 with a curving effort that hit the inside of the side netting			1
‘ @entity21 was one of the very few who was at his level , ’ admitted @entity56			0
‘ he was involved in the three goals , he was one of the two or three at the level			0
’ at that stage it was game over			0
@entity32 took a foothold in this match with a combination of canny second half substitutions by their coach			0
that , plus some outrageous good fortune			0
@entity21 meets the ball with a sweetly timed volley after his initial free - kick was blocked by the @entity32 wall @entity21 shows his delight after putting @entity10 2 - 0 up in the first half at the @entity1 @entity33 rushes over to congratulate his team - mate after @entity21 's sublime strike doubled @entity10 's lead @entity49 leads the celebrations as @entity10 secured a comfortable lead before half - time @entity48 's fine run and finish made it 3 - 0 to @entity10 just before the hour mark @entity48 wheels away in celebration after seemingly wrapping up the points for the @entity96 @entity37 hauls down his man inside the @entity10 box as the referee gives a penalty to the visitors @entity133 cooly slots home from the penalty spot for his second goal of the night to set up a nervy finish for @entity10 @entity52 - recently returned from injury - was named on the substitutes ' bench for @entity10 but never came on @entity37 was punished for pulling in the box , the offence that prompted @entity274 ’s campaign after grappling excesses in the @entity276			1
@entity37 hauled down substitute @entity30 and @entity84 referee @entity83 awarded the penalty to put life into @entity32			1
when @entity79 scored the @entity136 first when he met the cross from substitute @entity70 , the stadium was gripped by fear			1
@entity37 did nothing to lift the fog			0
this dopey @entity10 defender , an accident waiting to happen at the best of times , conceded a penalty when he body - checked @entity30			1
@entity79 , who had a colourful game to say the least ( and was booked before the final whistle ) , beat @entity41 with a neat penalty in the 73rd minute			1
it was then @entity78 , who thrashed around inside the technical area for 90 minutes , believed			0
@entity32 inevitably made it 3 - 3 in the 90th minute when @entity30 arrived inside the @entity10 ’s penalty area to head in a dramatic equaliser			1
if @entity56 ’s team makes it to the business end of this competition , they will get blown away			0
@entity30 beats @entity43 to a near - post header to complete the most unlikely of comebacks @entity30 ( no 45 ) scored at the end to rescue a point for @entity32 - for more from our brilliant @entity4 click here @entity32 's players run over to their fans to celebrate after earning a point from nowhere @entity32 players delighted with @entity10 comeback			1

@entity10 were 3 - 0 up against @entity32 before squandering their lead to drop two points in the @entity12
@entity30 scored the @entity136 ' equaliser in the last minute of *normal* time
a @entity45 penalty and sublime goals from @entity21 and @entity48 looked to have the game wrapped for the @entity96
former @entity321 man @entity133 began the comeback though he appeared to be *offside*
@entity79 then scored his second from the penalty spot after a @entity37 foul
