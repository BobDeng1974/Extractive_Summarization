ministers should not overrule the @entity3 by allowing same - sex marriage , the archbishop of @entity1 has said			1
@entity6 would be acting like a ‘ dictator ’ and overruling the @entity3 if he legalises gay marriage , dr @entity5 has warned			1
he told the prime minister that he will face a rebellion if he pushes ahead with plans to allow fully - fledged gay marriages			2
archbishop of york @entity5 says @entity6 would be like a ' dictator ' if he legalises gay marriage marriage is set in history and the government can not change it overnight , the second most senior cleric in the @entity17 added			1
the archbishop believes marriage must remain a union between a man and a woman			2
dr @entity5 said : ‘ i do n’t think it is the role of the state to define what marriage is			1
it is set in tradition and history and you ca n’t just ( change it ) overnight , no matter how powerful you are			2
‘ we ’ve seen dictators do it in different contexts and i do n’t want to redefine very clear social structures that have been in existence for a long time and then overnight the state believes it could go in a particular way			0
‘ it ’s almost like somebody telling you overnight that the @entity17 , whose job is to worship @entity49 , ( will become ) an arm of the @entity51			2
they must take arms and fight			0
you ’re completely changing tradition			0
' dr @entity5 , who is in @entity53 to mark its 50 years of independence , also said that the @entity17 ’s leadership needs to do more to avoid its leadership being solely white and middle class ( see below )			1
dr @entity5 pictured in @entity53 earlier this week			1
the archbishop believes marriage is set in history and can not be quickly changed by the government the government will open a consultation on its marriage reform bill in march , but the @entity17 has already warned that same - sex couples will be able to have church weddings if @entity6 goes ahead with the plans			1
the @entity17 ’s lawyers last month said that weddings will have to be offered to same - sex couples under any scheme to open the full privileges and title of marriage to gays and lesbians			1
dr @entity5 said the bishops in the @entity78 did not try to stop @entity79 introducing civil partnerships in 2004			1
he added the @entity17 was also content with last year ’s move to allow civil partnership ceremonies in places of worship , as long as it is voluntary			2
but dr @entity5 said the government would face a rebellion on any changes in legislation on gay civil marriage			1
‘ the rebellion is going to come not only from the bishops			0
you ’re going to get it from across the benches and in the @entity95 , ’ he said			0
‘ if you genuinely would like the registration of civil partnerships to happen in a more general way , most people will say they can see the drift			0
but if you begin to call those marriage , you ’re trying to change the @entity103 language			0
the church did not object to the introduction of civil partnerships in 2004 which gave same - sex couples improved legal rights			1
the state can not redefine what marriage is , dr @entity5 says ‘ that does not mean you diminish , condemn , criticise , patronise any same - sex relationships because that is not what the debate is about			1
‘ the @entity17 has always stood out - @entity116 actually was the odd man out			2
i ’d rather stick with @entity116 than be popular because it looks odd			0
’ mr @entity6 indicated his support for gay marriage in october , saying : ‘ conservatives believe in the ties that bind us ; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other			1
so i do n’t support gay marriage despite being a conservative			1
i support gay marriage because i ’m a conservative			1
’ the church needs better representation of black people , the archbishop argues @entity136 equalities minister @entity136 has indicated that nothing would force churches that disapprove of gay relationships to host same - sex ceremonies – but the @entity17 ’s analysis suggests any attempt to bar legalised gay marriage from churches would fall at the first court challenge			1
dr @entity5 has previously expressed concern over the ‘ gay marriage ’ of homosexual clergy after two reverends exchanged rings and vows at a service held in @entity153 the @entity154 in the @entity155 in 2008 in a joint statement with the archbishop of @entity159 dr @entity158 , he said : ‘ those clergy who disagree with the @entity17 ’s teaching are at liberty to seek to persuade others within the @entity17 of the reasons why they believe , in the light of @entity166 , tradition and reason that it should be changed			1
‘ but they are not at liberty simply to disregard it			0
’ human rights campaigner @entity171 , co-ordinator of the @entity173 campaign , said : ‘ archbishop @entity5 is a religious authoritarian who wants to impose his personal opposition to same - sex marriage on the rest of society			1
‘ it is not a @entity182 value to demand legal discrimination against gay couples and to treat them as inferior , second - class citizens - with fewer rights than everyone else			2
‘ the government is proposing to legalise same - sex civil marriages in register offices			2
this will not affect churches			0
‘ the archbishop has no valid grounds for objecting to civil legislation that will ensure marriage equality for all couples			0
’ the @entity17 must do more to avoid its leadership being solely white and middle class , the archbishop of @entity1 has said			2
dr @entity5 said white working class parishioners and black church - goers are poorly represented in the @entity17 church			1
he said : ‘ i used to chair the committee for minority ethnic @entity17 concerns , and we seemed to be making some progress but that now seems to be going backwards			0
' where we have lost out is black people who had been realised @entity211 , who are now joining pentecostal churches			2
that 's a huge drain			0
’ he said white working - class parishioners were often relegated to making tea after services , and added : ‘ the church should be a sign of the kingdom of heaven and should be telling us what it will look like			0
‘ @entity224 is not going to be full of just black people , just working - class people , just middle - class people , it 's going to be , in the words of @entity228 , a rainbow people of @entity49 in all its diversity			2
’ addressing the accusation of ‘ institutional racism ’ in the @entity235 that came out of the inquiry following the murder of black teenager @entity238 , dr @entity5 said he believes many organisations have made progress over the past decade			1
however , he said other institutions have avoided addressing the issue			0
‘ those that did it , there is some kind of change			0
@entity249 never did it , so i 'm not surprised ( by allegations of racism on the pitch )			0
‘ i did n't hear that the media ever said let 's put a mirror to ourselves and see whether there is n't this tendency of stereotyping , or being prejudiced , of advantaging people because they went to the same school			0
’ the archbishop said he never encountered racism from fellow clergy in his rise through the ranks of the @entity17 but said he did have to deal with racist parishioners			0
‘ when i was a vicar there was a lady who did n't want me to take her husband 's funeral because i was black			0
' i took one funeral and at the end a man said to me , ' why did my father deserve to be buried by a black monkey ? ' we received letters with excrement in			0

marriage is set in history and can not be changed overnight . it should be between a man and a woman , dr @entity5 says
@entity6 has shown support for a gay marriage bill
the church needs more ' black people '
@entity297 @entity296 minister says the @entity17 would not have to administer the same - sex ceremonies but the @entity17 says this would not *uphold* in court
