a drug already approved to treat cancer could now help battle the ravages of dementia a cancer drug could help ­ protect brain cells from the effects of ­ alzheimer 's disease , new research has found			1
the breakthrough came as scientists discovered the toxic protein that was believed to cause dementia is not actually responsible			1
it is actually a different protein that triggers the destruction of important connections in the brain , called neurons			2
researchers , from the @entity20 in @entity21 found it is the tau protein that kills neurons in the brain when it malfunctions			2
the study 's findings mean dementia can now be treated with nilotinib - a cancer drug already used by patients battling leukaemia			2
the drug can help the brain 's neurons clear the excessive ' garbage ' that builds up			1
the research , which has been published in journal @entity38 , found neurons are killed when the tau ­ protein stops functioning			2
dr @entity43 , who led the research , said : ' when tau does not function , the cell can not remove the garbage , which at that point includes @entity48 as well as tangles of non-functioning tau , and the cell dies			0
' the @entity48 released from the dead neuron then sticks to the plaque that had been forming			0
' dr @entity43 has long sought a way to force neurons to clean up their ' garbage '			0
in this study , he shows that @entity59 can aid in that process			0
dementia is caused when neurons in the brain die as a result of malfunctioning tau protein , which is supposed to clear the brain 's build - up of ' garbage '			1
this can happen due to ageing or faulty genes but he added that while nilotinib helps the neuron clear garbage , but requires some functional tau			1
he said : ' this drug can work if there is a higher percentage of good to bad tau in the cell			0
' there are many diseases of dementia that have malfunctioning tau and no plaque accumulation , such as frontal temporal dementia linked to @entity87 ' the common culprit is tau , so a drug that helps tau do its job may help protect against progression of these diseases			0
' @entity95 can malfunction due to faulty genes or because of ageing			1
as ­ people grow older , some tau can malfunction with enough normal tau remaining to help clear the garbage , therefore neurons are not killed .			0

scientists found toxic protein thought to cause dementia is not responsible
different protein , called tau , leads to destruction of *vital* brain connections
@entity95 kills brain 's neurons if it malfunctions due to ageing or faulty genes
but cancer drug nilotinib can fight this and help clear the brain 's ' garbage '
