scientists have ruled that the year 2015 will be one second longer to compensate for the slowing of the rotation of the @entity3			1
but it is feared that this ' leap second ' added at midday on june 30 could trigger devastating crashes across the internet			1
the extra second is needed because the @entity3 's rotation is gradually slowing down by around two thousandths of a second per day and needs to catch up with atomic time			1
the @entity11 says 30 june 2015 will be a second longer			1
an extra second will be added at 11:59:60pm @entity13 to sync up clocks ( stock image shown )			1
this is to account for discrepancy between @entity3 time and atomic time			1
it is the 26th leap second to be added since 1972 the extra unit will be added at 11:59:60pm @entity13 on 30 june , bringing the total number of seconds for 2015 up to 31,536,001			1
in it is the 26th time in history since 1972 that a leap second will have been added			1
the decision to add an extra second year was announced by the @entity11 and the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			2
leap seconds are occasionally used to help ‘ @entity3 time ’ catch up to ‘ atomic time ’			1
the latter is constant but the former is slower by about two thousands of a second per day			0
of the daily sum of 86,400 seconds measured by atomic clocks , @entity3 rotates about 0.002 seconds slower			2
this is due to the discrepancy between atomic time and the mathematically calculated time of @entity3 's date			1
however , @entity3 's rotation is also getting slower , on the order of a millisecond or so every century			0
it 's thought that , four billion years ago , a day on the planet lasted just 22 hours			0
this is mostly due to the tidal pull from the moon , which is very slightly slowing the rotation of @entity3			0
to keep them in sync , it is necessary to occasionally jump @entity3 ’s time back - for mathematical reasons similar to adding leap years			1
the decision to do so is made every time @entity3 time is slower by about half a second , making it about half a second quicker instead			2
however , adding a second can have rather disastrous effects on various internet systems			0
in 2012 a problem was caused when subsystems got confused by the time change and caused hyperactivity on certain servers			2
many companies including @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 reported crashes as their systems struggled to cope with the change			2
while precautions have been taken to cope with the change this time , it is often a lesser known subsystem that succumbs to the changed time			2
this time around some websites could go offline if a glitch in their systems is unearthed			0
to alleviate the problem some companies , such as @entity85 , add fractions of a second over the preceding year so that they do n’t need to make a sudden jump - known as a ' leap smear '			0
it might be the last leap second added , as some countries want to scrap the practice			2
the last leap second in 2012 caused problems for some companies when their systems failed to cope with the change			1
the second is added because @entity3 's rotation ( image from space shown ) does not match up with atomic time leap seconds are added on one of two dates each year , either 30 june or 31 december			1
the first was added on the former date in 1972 , and 25 have since been added in the subsequent 42 years			0
‘ @entity3 is slowing down a little bit , ’ said @entity106 , the chief of @entity107 at the @entity108			0
‘ they add an extra second to something called @entity13 ( @entity13 ) in order to make sure the rate of @entity13 is the same as atomic time , ’ he said			1
‘ for that day [ june 30 ] there 'll be 86,401 seconds , instead of 86,400 seconds			0
the length of the day for you and i and everyone on the @entity3 will have an extra second			2
' the discrepancies between @entity3 time as calculated by its rotation ( @entity13 ) and atomic time ( @entity126 ) is shown here			1
atomic time can be taken to be the line at zero , while the ' slowing ' @entity3 time ( and the extra seconds added ) can be seen by the spikes on the green line			1
a second is added when it lags by about 0.6 seconds however , some nations including the @entity134 have supported a change to get rid of leap seconds			2
they instead simply want to let the clocks run out of sync			0
were such a decision to be made , though , it 's unlikely we could ever go back to a leap second system and keep the clocks in sync			0
this is because the clocks would be out of sync by several minutes , or maybe hours eventually , which would be virtually impossible to add to systems without disastrous consequences			0
without leap seconds , there would be a slip of two to three minutes by the year 2100 , and half an hour by 2700			0
other countries , like @entity155 , wanted to keep leap seconds to preserve certain regularities - such as @entity158 , which is the time when the sun crosses the @entity160			0
a vote is due to take place by the @entity163 and the @entity164 later in the year to decide the fate of the leap second			0
and if its opponents get their way , this might be the last time the number of seconds in a year reaches 31,536,001 .			0

the @entity11 says 30 june 2015 will be a second longer
an extra second will be added at 11:59:60pm @entity13 to sync up clocks
this is to account for discrepancy between @entity3 time and atomic time
it is the 26th leap second to be added since 1972
but it might be the last , as some countries want to scrap the practice
the last leap second in 2012 caused problems for some internet companies when their systems failed to cope with the change
