he then picks up a power drill , which he has attached a stiff toilet brush to the end of it			2
mr @entity14 then blasts the potatoes with the hose , while at the same time holding the drill with the brush attached inside the bucket			2
the potatoes then go into a spin as the force of the drill and hose begin to wash and peel them after a minute of the potatoes being spun , he then drains away the excess water ready to reveal the spuds he then tips the potatoes , which have been cleaned and peeled into a pan ready to be cooked he continues to hose down the spuds while using the drill brush to quickly peel them			1
and less than a minute later , he pours out the excess water to reveal his washed and peeled potatoes , which he places into a pan			0
