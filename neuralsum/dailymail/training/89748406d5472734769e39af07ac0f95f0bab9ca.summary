it says much about how far @entity1 have come as a club that @entity4 ’s men entered this game expecting to beat a team who have won the @entity8 three times in the past five years			1
in the end , as on so many occasions last season , the @entity1 were a match in every department except the one that matters — the scoreboard — for a visiting side stacked with international talent			2
if @entity21 had not narrowly knocked on @entity23 ’s inside pass with the line beckoning 16 minutes from time , the result may have been different			2
@entity25 of @entity26 calls a move during the @entity8 match against @entity1 , with @entity25 scoring three penalties during the clash at @entity31 @entity32 of @entity26 collects a kick through to score his side 's opening try at @entity31 if the @entity1 had opted to kick a penalty at goal with time on the clock , the result may have been different			1
if flanker @entity40 had not been sin - binned by referee @entity41 five minutes from time — gifting @entity26 another three points — the result might have been different			1
but ‘ ifs ’ do n’t deliver @entity8 wins and ultimately , yet again , a young @entity47 side were not quite street smart enough to close out victory against one of the best in the business			2
‘ we were one moment away from beating a good @entity26 side , ’ said @entity4 , @entity1 ’s director of rugby			1
‘ if @entity21 had held on to the ball , we win by a point , we would be sitting here delighted with a performance with a lot of endeavour about it and we ’d have scored some good tries			2
‘ i try not to get too carried away when a game does come down to one or two moments because there ’s no value in that			0
but the lads will know where we lost that game			0
we lost composure at key times			0
’ with £ 10million spent redeveloping @entity31 by the upwardly mobile chiefs ahead of next year ’s @entity72 , there were high hopes around the ground at kick - off			1
but , just as parts of the stadium remain a work in progress , so do elements of @entity4 ’s team			0
@entity82 , 21 , played out of position at outside centre but proved more than a match for @entity86 and clearly has a very big future , while inside centre @entity21 is rough , tough and direct			0
@entity1 ' @entity89 is tackled by @entity26 ' @entity90 in the @entity8 clash there are also high - calibre players to return			1
@entity96 wing @entity94 has recovered from knee surgery and will play in an a league game against @entity99 on monday night , while highly rated hooker @entity100 is also expected to play again within a month to bolster a creaking @entity1 line - out			1
but , at the moment , they do not possess the killer instinct to attack the jugular of the @entity8 ’s biggest beasts			0
@entity4 said : ‘ you ca n’t buy experience and we have guys out there who are learning minute by minute			0
we are going to have to take some pain but we ’ll reap the rewards			0
’ @entity40 and @entity115 scored @entity1 ’s tries , while @entity89 kicked 10 points , but they allowed a 17 - 10 lead just before half - time to slip as @entity26 fly - half @entity25 — signed to replace @entity120 — became an increasingly influential figure in the match			1
@entity25 , impressive in @entity125 for @entity96 this summer after a disastrous final season at @entity124 , kicked four out of five kicks at goal and set up @entity32 ’s first - half try with a neat grubber kick into the in - goal area			1
@entity26 ' @entity131 ( front left ) gestures to the referee as @entity1 ' @entity115 ( centre ) celebrates with his team mates after he dives over to score their side 's second try it was , according to his scrum - half partner @entity139 , a ‘ faultless performance ’			1
‘ @entity25 would n’t be @entity25 without the odd maverick moment , ’ said @entity139 , who scored @entity26 ’s second try after 57 minutes			1
‘ but he knows he needs to be consistent and he has produced two faultless performances in his first two games for the club			0
he ’s got a big match against ( @entity96 rival ) @entity148 when we play @entity150 next week			0
’ @entity26 boss @entity151 opted to keep @entity152 on the sidelines following the stinger injury he suffered in pre-season , insisting he will be in the match - day 23 to face @entity150 , and he left @entity31 satisfied with his side ’s second win out of two this season			1
‘ sides will get beaten here who will be in and around us at the end of the season , ’ @entity151 said			0
‘ both sides had guys missing but that was a good win on the road			2
@entity25 is working really hard			2
sometimes he will get it right , sometimes he wo n’t — but i was happy with him today			0
