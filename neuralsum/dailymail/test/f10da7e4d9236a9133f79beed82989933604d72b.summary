@entity0 has been living in her two - bedroom apartment for more than 50 years an @entity4 - @entity3 grandmother is facing eviction from her $ 820 - a - month apartment in @entity9 's @entity8 neighborhood			1
@entity0 , 85 , who has lived there for more than 50 years received a letter seeking to increase rent to the market rate of $ 3,500 a month , far more than the retired shopkeeper can afford			1
her landlord is the @entity16 which is dedicated to the legacy of @entity4 - @entity3 and is situated below her home			1
the fight over her two - bedroom apartment began five years ago			1
' why would you want to throw me out when i lived here all my life ? ' asked @entity0 , a feisty , raspy - voiced woman who proudly tells how she once even served as queen of the annual @entity24 , @entity8 's most well - known event			2
' this is my neighborhood			0
' she has been living in the apartment since 1962 when rent was only $ 150 a month , according to @entity29			1
the spat is the latest involving the museum to cause a commotion in @entity8 , a neighborhood of former tenement buildings and narrow streets in @entity9 that was once a bustling center of @entity4 immigrant life			2
an @entity4 restaurant that had been open for decades closed its doors last week in a separate rent - related dispute			1
' the negative press that this has caused is so detrimental to the spirit of the @entity4 immigrant , ' said @entity46 , whose family has run an @entity4 specialty foods shop in @entity8 for over a century			2
' i 'm upset over it			0
they sent her a letter five years ago seeking to increase rent to $ 3,500 but in recent decades , the character of @entity8 has been transformed by waves of gentrification and wealthy newcomers			1
the latest @entity70 data from 2013 shows only 554 out of 7,816 residents , about seven per cent , in the @entity70 tract encompassing @entity0 's street identify as having @entity4 ancestry			1
museum president @entity76 told the @entity77 that even after all @entity4 - @entity3 had gone from the area , ' the legacy would still remain because we have an institution that does that			1
' neither the museum 's president nor its spokesman replied to multiple emails and phone messages from @entity87 seeking comment			0
but they have said the museum is looking to expand its space , or sell the properties to a developer and remain there rent - free			0
@entity0 , who has a daughter in @entity96 and a granddaughter on @entity98 , believes the museum is just after more money , pointing out that her upstairs neighbors pay several thousand dollars a month in rent			1
the grandmother tried to go through the courts to see if the city 's rent regulation laws could help , but it was determined that her apartment was n't covered			0
still , she is hopeful she can fight through the courts to forestall the eviction order			0
a judge has given her lawyers until april 13 to find some kind of solution			0
@entity115 , the shuttered restaurant , was evicted after being in business since the 1980s			0
@entity0 poses for picture in her apartment in the @entity8 section of @entity9 on march 31 , 2015 @entity0 believes the museum is just after more money as her neighbors pay several thousand dollars a month in rent she said @entity125 , who ran the restaurant with his wife , said they had been late with a $ 17,000 rent payment in february , and were told they would have to go unless they were willing to pay almost twice that per month			1
' now another piece of @entity8 is gone , ' he said			0
truthfully , there 's not a lot of @entity8 left , mainly a couple of blocks of @entity138 , populated with @entity4 restaurants and tourist stores featuring trinkets and ' kiss me , i 'm @entity4 ' and ' @entity143 ' t - shirts			2
' the sort of everyday lived experience of the place as a residence of @entity4 for all intents has been over for decades , ' said @entity151 of the @entity152 at @entity153			0
but for a museum dedicated to that history , turning @entity0 out shows ' a lack of vision , ' he said , suggesting it could have tapped @entity0 as a speaker or in some other capacity			0
@entity0 , he said , ' is literally the living embodiment of the living history of @entity8			2
' on saturday , a rally was held in support of @entity0 keeping her apartment as protesters gathered outside of the museum to protest			2
the grandmother was due to be evicted on monday but a judge has given her lawyers until april 13 to find a solution .			0
