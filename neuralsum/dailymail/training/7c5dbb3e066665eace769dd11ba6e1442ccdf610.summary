by @entity1 reporter rail commuters can expect the price of some tickets to rise by as much as 5.6 per cent next year			1
campaigners say fares are rising four times faster than wages and that the system used to calculate price increases is ‘ discredited ’			1
the january 2015 rise for regulated fares , which include season tickets , will be based on the @entity15 inflation figure for july 2014 which is published on tuesday			1
feeling the pinch : commuters at @entity18 's @entity17			0
some fares will rise by as much as 5.6 per cent the price - rise formula is @entity15 plus 1 per cent , which would mean average fares going up 3.6 per cent if @entity15 remains at its june 2014 level of 2.6 per cent			1
but there is also a ‘ flex ’ rule that allows train companies to raise some regulated fares by a further 2 per cent as long as the overall average remains at the @entity15 plus 1 per cent level			1
this means some fares could rise by around 5.6 per cent in the new year			1
in his 2013 autumn statement , chancellor @entity32 pegged the regulated - fare rise equal to @entity15 while reducing the ‘ flex ’ rule from 5 per cent to 2 per cent			1
he will now face pressure to make a similar announcement in his statement this year			0
the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) said fares had gone up 20.4 per cent over the lifetime of this @entity41 , with the increase likely to be around 24.7 per cent when the january 2015 rise takes effect			2
that compared to wages rising at 6.9 per cent over the past four years , said the @entity38 , with the cost of commuting now taking up as much as a fifth of some passengers ’ annual salaries			2
it said : ‘ fare changes are determined by a discredited measurement			0
the @entity15 is deemed to over-estimate inflation			1
hard winter : fares will go up again in the first week of january			2
the @entity38 said : ' fare changes are determined by a discredited measurement			0
the @entity15 is deemed to over-estimate inflation ' ‘ our research has shown that the government ’s practice of linking regulated fares to @entity15 rather than the more accurate @entity64 measure has cost commuters hundreds of pounds over the last decade			1
it added : ' many commuters live in marginal constituencies , where @entity69 should be aware that unsustainable fare increases during this @entity41 could persuade people to vote for change in may ’s general election			0
' unions forming the @entity76 ’s campaign group action for @entity77 will be holding demonstrations at rail stations across the country on tuesday			0
@entity81 , acting general secretary of the @entity83 transport union , said passengers were ' being lined up for an inflation - busting increase in their fares '			2
the @entity83 is angered that the @entity77 company has axed some off - peak early - evening tickets on some routes			0
mr @entity81 said : ' you can bet your life that other train companies will seize on the move by @entity77 to abolish off - peak fares , clobbering the travelling public with a double whammy that will hit them hard in the pocket while the train companies are laughing all the way to the bank			0
' a @entity106 spokesperson said : ' no decisions on fare rises for 2015 have yet been taken			0
' we understand people ’s concerns about the cost of travel and the impact this has on family budgets			0
that is why for 2014 we reduced average fare rises to @entity15 plus 0 per cent for the first time in a decade			2
