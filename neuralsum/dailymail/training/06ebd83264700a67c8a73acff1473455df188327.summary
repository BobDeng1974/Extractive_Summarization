@entity1 ’ 18 - year - old midfielder @entity0 will have the chance to show why the @entity4 ’s big boys are after him against @entity5 on tuesday night			1
@entity6 has taken @entity7 by storm since establishing himself as one of the @entity1 ’ key men at a tender age			1
the highly - rated midfielder made his debut in 2012 in an @entity15 first round match against @entity16 at the age of 16 and his first goal for the club came in the replay at stadium : mk			1
@entity27 were hopeful of completing a £ 3.5million summer swoop for @entity6 and the @entity29 club had opened talks with the @entity7 club over a move for the 18 - year - old midfielder			1

' i 've said from the word go , he 's as good as it gets and he 's the best young player i 've ever worked with			0
’ although he made his debut in 2012 , it was last season where he became an important figure in the @entity1 ’ starting @entity48 , making a total of 37 appearances , scoring seven goals			2

youth : the @entity1 youngster made his debut at the age of 16 in an @entity15 match against @entity16 it is obvious @entity6 has an eye for goal as in his last season for the under 18s , he finished as the top scorer with 17 , leading him to sign a three - year professional contract			1
he has started this season in a similar fashion , already netting his first goal of the season in the 3 - 2 loss at @entity80			0
@entity6 has made nine and two appearances for the @entity83 under 17s and 18s respectively but is yet to get on the scoresheet at international level			2
having shown so much promise , if @entity87 is able to continue his progress it ’s hard to see him remaining an @entity1 player for much longer , especially if he impresses against @entity4 opponents			0
indeed , the side he ’s facing on tuesday night could well be his future destination			0
