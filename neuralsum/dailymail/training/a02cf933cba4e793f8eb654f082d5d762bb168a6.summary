by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 11 march 2013 the woman accused of gagging a whistleblower who was raising concerns about patient safety has been given one of the most powerful roles in the @entity7			1
dame @entity8 has been made interim deputy chief executive of the new body in charge of the health service , second only to its head sir @entity13			2
she is said to have helped authorise a payment of £ 500,000 to silence the chief executive of a hospital trust where 670 patients are feared to have died needlessly			1
dame @entity8 , a former gp , is also being investigated by the @entity20 for allegedly quashing a report into high death rates at the trust , @entity24			1
the move comes amid mounting concern that senior @entity7 managers are not being brought to book for their failings			1
her promotion was almost certainly overseen by sir @entity13 , who is himself facing growing calls to resign over his role in the @entity35 scandal			2
yesterday @entity36 , the whistleblower allegedly gagged by @entity8 , said : ‘ it shows a blatant disregard for public concerns			1
‘ it also shows the board has deep contempt for any investigations and processes that are under way			2
calls to resign : sir @entity13 , chief executive of the @entity7 is facing strong criticism himself over the @entity35 scandal ‘ she ’s been under investigation for the @entity20 for four months now for putting patients at risk			1
it also shows contempt for public concern over her action in gagging me			2
’ mr @entity36 was chief executive of @entity57 until 2010 when he was sacked after warning @entity8 that targets were being put ahead of patients			2
he was later given a £ 500,000 payoff on the condition he keep quiet about shocking standards at the hospital			1
last month he broke his silence to claim that @entity8 , then head of the regional body supervising the hospital , had ordered him to prioritise targets			0
he also claimed he had warned sir @entity13 about the hospital in 2009 but had been ignored			0
the @entity20 has yet to decide whether @entity8 should face a disciplinary hearing			0
but next week she and sir @entity13 will come under renewed pressure when mr @entity36 gives evidence about his gagging order to mps			0
he claims he has evidence showing the pair were involved in the contract to silence him which he will show to mps on the health select committee			0
last week when sir @entity13 appeared before the same mps he insisted he would ‘ never sanction ’ such gagging orders			0
@entity8 , 55 , currently earns £ 70,000 a year as the national managing director on the @entity81 , the new body in charge of @entity84 and hospitals			1
from next month she will take up the combined role as interim deputy chief executive as well as chief operating officer			0
as the promotion is only temporary , she will remain on the same salary			0
a spokesman for the board said : ‘ this is an interim measure while we organise a full and open competition for the role			0

@entity98 already earns £ 70,000 as an @entity7 managing director
she is being investigated for allegedly quashing a report into death rates
