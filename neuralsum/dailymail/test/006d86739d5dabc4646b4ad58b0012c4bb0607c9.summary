will @entity0 is hoping for third time lucky this weekend in his bid to finally compete in a grand prix weekend with @entity4			1
@entity0 has yet to turn a wheel in anger for his new team in either qualifying or the race in the opening two @entity11 events of the year in @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity4 have naturally had their teething problems since being rescued from administration , notably in @entity18 where @entity0 and team - mate @entity19 failed to make it out on track for a single lap due to the rebuild of their it infrastructure			1
manor driver @entity0 is hoping to compete in the @entity24 this weekend at @entity27 , after taking part in the two friday practice sessions , @entity0 frustratingly missed final practice and qualifying due to a fuel system issue			1
the 23 - year - old , speaking ahead of this weekend 's @entity24 , said : ' clearly @entity14 was a tough weekend for me			1
' it started pretty well , i felt comfortable in the car straight away , and the pace we had in @entity37 and @entity38 would have got us easily inside 107 per cent for qualifying , so that was a positive			0
' to then miss qualifying and the race was disappointing , but then we came into this year knowing the first few races would be difficult			2
' i want to be out in quali and racing , and if i 'm not then i 'm going to be disappointed and frustrated because my job is to race			2
@entity0 , pictured driving during a practice session in @entity14 , is yet to compete in qualifying this season ' but i understand everything that has gone on			1
it 's great the team are back ( in @entity11 ) and i understand the effort that has gone into that			2
' it 's not as if i 'm sitting here not understanding what everyone has had to go through			2
' i 'm part of the team and i need to understand everything that is going on			0
as i do , it makes problems easier to get through			0
' so third time lucky and i hope this weekend will be good			0
' coming here we 're in a much better position again and i 'd like to think i 'll be racing			0
' @entity0 is confident the problem that struck in @entity14 will not reoccur at the @entity63			1
@entity0 walks alongside his @entity4 team - mate @entity19 at @entity65 late last month ' it 's about working our way through everything we 've got to get through , ' said @entity0			1
' gremlins creep up and you have to figure out what they are and move on from there			0
' that 's what we 've done and we 're as sure as we can be this weekend we should be running smoothly			0
' @entity19 saw the flag in @entity14 , which was great for the team he did			2
it was good data and mileage			0
' so this weekend we should be up and running and everything should be good			0

@entity85 driver @entity0 did not compete in @entity13 or @entity14
