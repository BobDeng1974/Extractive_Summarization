@entity0 claims to have identified and spoken with the person he wants to be his new coach - but insists an announcement may not be made until after the @entity4			1
‘ i have an idea of exactly what i want and i ’ve thought about it a lot , ’ he told the @entity5 on friday			2
‘ i have spoken to them and i ’ll see			1
it is not like you chat to the person and the next day it is done			2
’ @entity15 has said he would be willing to replace @entity16 and @entity0 has previously insisted he needs someone who can give him more time than the @entity19 was latterly able to provide			1
closing in : @entity0 has decided on who he wants to succeed @entity16 as his coach set in clay : @entity0 , preparing for the @entity4 at @entity23 , will soon announce his new mentor ‘ i would n’t expect anything in the next few days but i ’m closer than i was in @entity31 last week			1
it ’s not about rushing , ’ said the @entity26 champion , having also been linked with @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 ‘ you have to get a contract in place and there are always a few little complications in that respect			1
but , as long as the desire from both people is to work together then i hope it can happen fairly soon			2
' there is always a bit of detail that needs to get worked out and more in - depth discussion about things			0
‘ hopefully , nothing will happen in the next couple of weeks because i ’ll still be here ( at @entity23 ) , but maybe just after			0
’ @entity0 has been given a middling sort of draw , facing @entity53 ’s world no 55 @entity54 in the first round with a possible quarter - final against @entity58 champion @entity57			1
unlikely : @entity15 's name has been connected with the role from the outset , but time will be an issue contender : @entity65 's @entity27 is another former legend to be connected to the @entity0 camp challenge : @entity0 fell to @entity68 in the @entity31 and will have to get through the eight - time @entity4 champion to make the final first round : @entity54 ( @entity53 ) second round : @entity73 ( @entity74 ) third round : @entity76 ( @entity77 ) fourth round : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) quarter - final : @entity57 ( @entity82 ) semi-final : @entity68 ( @entity84 ) final : @entity86 ( @entity87 ) the @entity88 seemed reasonably unfazed , although is aware of the danger @entity90 presents			1
‘ he plays exciting tennis , goes for his shots , and when he ’s on he makes it very difficult , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ his form has been inconsistent because of his game style but he beat @entity57 in the @entity97 this year , he ’s got a big forehand and does n’t hold back			0
’ @entity0 has been joined here by @entity100 , who carved himself a small piece of tennis history on friday when he became the first @entity104 man in 41 years to qualify for the @entity4			1
the @entity107 cabbie ’s son scored one of his best career victories — and a minimum payday of £ 20,000 — by coming back to beat highly - rated former @entity112 college champion @entity111 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 12 - 10			0
historic : @entity100 became the first @entity114 to reach the @entity4 through qualifying @entity116 could make it a highly unusual @entity104 double on saturday if she can overcome @entity119 @entity118 in the women ’s final qualifying round to also make it into the main draw			1
but friday was a reminder of the stirring @entity97 performances for which @entity104 no 3 @entity100 is best known			0
his three - match run into the main draw had unpromising beginnings when he arrived a day late in @entity128 after watching his beloved @entity129 win the @entity130 last week			0
he not only got to watch the final , but met up with a few of the players afterwards before catching the train			0
unique : @entity116 could make it a double for @entity104 is she wins saturday 's qualifying final ‘ i probably should have been in @entity128 preparing early but i could n’t say no to @entity129 , ’ he said			2
‘ at 2 - 0 down after 10 minutes , i was thinking : “ everyone who knows i am at this game will absolutely slaughter me ”			0
‘ my coach was n’t too happy with me but he knows i ’m mad about @entity129 , so he let it go			2
even though he ’s an @entity74 , he realised we have n’t been in too many finals lately			0
’ it was not all joy for the @entity148 yesterday , with @entity149 losing 6 - 7 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 0 in the final round of women ’s qualifying to @entity152 and @entity153 going out of the second round of the men ’s event 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 to @entity157 .			0
