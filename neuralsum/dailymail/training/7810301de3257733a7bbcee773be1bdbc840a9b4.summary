by @entity0 a planned three - day strike by @entity3 workers in a row over tube ticket office closures was today dramatically called off after last - ditch talks			1
rail , @entity8 and @entity9 union members were due to walk out from 9pm , but a breakthrough was made at a meeting with @entity3			1
the union said the industrial action had been suspended			0
@entity3 mayor @entity15 described it as a ‘ victory for common sense and for @entity19 ’			1
a sign at @entity25 station is pictured unpleasant commute : passengers outside @entity29 underground station during the strike last tuesday unhappy commute : crowds wait for buses outside victoria station during the strike action last tuesday but @entity37 acting general secretary @entity36 said : ‘ due to the solidarity and determination of our @entity3 members , and their delivery of rock - solid industrial action last week , we have been able to secure real movement and significant progress on the issues at the heart of this dispute in talks with the @entity49 over the bank holiday weekend			1
‘ pre-conditions have been removed , protection of earnings has been agreed and we now have a viable framework for a proper review of the cuts and closures programme			1
‘ as a result of that progress , secured directly through our members campaign of industrial action and the union 's drive to get the facts across to the people of @entity3 , we are able to suspend the action due to commence this evening and further talks around the fundamental issues of cuts to jobs , services and safety will now take place			1
’ @entity74 , chief operating officer of @entity3 , said : ‘ i am pleased that @entity19 will not have to endure further strike action this week			1
‘ the only way to resolve this dispute is for the @entity37 leadership to work with us to shape the future of the @entity49 in a changing world			1
it is good that they have committed to doing so alongside the three other unions involved			0
‘ as we have always said , we are , of course , open to discuss any proposals our staff or the unions may offer			0
‘ @entity88 means that it is our intention to close all ticket offices , used in less than 3 per cent of journeys , and instead deliver a vastly better customer service by bringing more staff than ever before out on to the concourses of stations at ticket machines , ticket gates and platforms - just as we delivered during the @entity100			2
‘ this will also allow us to save £ 50million per annum to reinvest in better and more reliable train services and to keep fares down			0
’ called off : people queue outside @entity106 circus underground station last tuesday during last week 's strike crowded : commuters wait for the jubilee line at @entity110 in @entity3 last wednesday the development followed talks at the conciliation service			1
an @entity115 spokeman said : ' we are pleased that we have been able to assist the parties to reach an understanding that allows the industrial action this week to be withdrawn			2
' mr @entity15 said : ‘ this is a victory for common sense and for @entity19			0
the @entity37 leadership has finally seen that their tactics are n't working			2
‘ i always said these strikes were pointless , and by getting so many people to work during last week 's stoppage @entity9 has shown the @entity37 that its actions , supported by a minority of its members , will achieve nothing			1
‘ it is vital that we continue to reform the tube for the benefit of our passengers			0
i 'm delighted that hard - working @entity19 and businesses across the capital will now be free to go about their work without the threat of needless industrial action			0
‘ it is essential we get on with our modernisation programme and that includes the closure of 260 ticket offices , saving £ 50million a year that will be reinvested into the network			2
‘ this will get more staff out from behind glass screens and back offices to help passengers , and all without any need for compulsory redundancies			0
‘ there is no justification at all for holding @entity3 to ransom			2
tomorrow the government will announce their support for my proposals on ballot thresholds which will limit the power of unions to disrupt the capital in the future , on a whim and without majority support			0
‘ that @entity160 backing is very welcome , as is this morning 's decision to call off the strike			0
