a consumer advocacy group has slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as ' truly frightening ' , as its revealed they could expose @entity4 internet users to unlimited damages payout to @entity7 studios			1
under the new @entity10 , anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from @entity7 studios for illegally downloading movies , tv shows , and music			1
consumer group choice labelled the plan , which was compiled by @entity4 's largest internet service providers ( @entity17 's ) at the request of the federal government , as ' medieval ' and said it ' reads like a horror movie script '			1
under the proposed code , a three - strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads			2
customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their @entity17 's - a warning , an ' education ' notice , and a final notice			1
the breaches will be identified through technology which tracks activity on internet protocol addresses , and a notice will then be sent to the account holder to advise them of the suspected infringement			0
if offenders receive a a third warning , @entity17 will be allowed to provide the customers details - a move that would allow the copyright holder to target the user directly			1
choice campaign manager @entity51 said that the new code could funnel average @entity4 into a frightening and confusing court battle			2
' the code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action			0
often consumers share with flatmates , partners , or family , which means that even those who do n't download illegally could be taken to court , ' ms @entity51 told @entity65			0
the @entity66 , the industry body backing the proposed code , released a statement last week emphasising the ' public education ' elements of the code , but noted that the scheme did provide a process of ' facilitated preliminary discovery '			2
' ultimately we ’re trying to strike a balance			0
we ’re trying to ensure privacy and that personal details are protected , that any allegation ( of copyright infringement ) will be independently reviewed , that customers do n’t face sanctions , ' @entity77 from the @entity78 told news.com.au			0
the discovery process means that @entity17 's would be obligated to aid ' rights holders ' - such a @entity7 studios - to locate and take legal action against those suspected of illegally downloading content			1
in @entity4 , piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of @entity96			0
piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of @entity96 @entity99 has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups 55 % of @entity4 who downloaded content , including @entity107 spin - off @entity105 ( above ) illegally said it was because of a lack of access while the statement also said that the code ' contains strong safeguards against any threat to the privacy of internet users ' and that the consumer could appeal the final notice , ms @entity51 said that @entity119 had serious concerns about the consequences for consumers			1
the @entity17 's - including @entity123 , @entity124 , and @entity125 - are obligated after the final warning to co-operate when rights holders wish to locate the consumer suspected of illegally downloading content			1
in a case earlier in february , the rights holders of the @entity131 - winning film @entity132 demanded that @entity125 hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie			1
the @entity17 expressed concerns the rights holder would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter , reported news.com.au			1
' they ca n't oppose it , they have to participate when the rights holders want to take consumers to court			1
we are very worried about the lack of protection provided to everyday @entity4 , who could face huge fines that do n't match the crime , ' said ms @entity51			2
' the code is an uncapped system of fines , which means that there is no limit to what someone could be made to pay under the scheme , ' she said			2
ms @entity51 said that 55 % of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources in feburary , the rights holders of the @entity131 - winning film @entity132 ( above ) demanded that @entity125 hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie the @entity17 expressed concerns the rights holder of the @entity171 ( above ) would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter unlike in @entity175 , @entity4 has no limit to fines under the @entity178 , and it is up to the judge 's discretion as to what the consumer is fined			1
' in the @entity184 , which also has an uncapped system , a consumer was sued by @entity187 and fined $ 675,000 for downloading and uploading 30 songs , ' said ms @entity51			2
' this is why we are worried , this is a completely disproportionate system			0
we are not talking about a slap on the wrist , the punishment nowhere near fits the crime , ' she said			0
the @entity78 maintains that while the scheme may not be a popular move with some customer , the industry body made genuine efforts to provide a reasonable balance between education and preventing further illegal downloading			1
ms @entity51 said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as @entity206 available in @entity4 , the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed ' consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online , but that they are blocked from accessing it			0
it makes very little sense to them , ' said ms @entity51 the @entity17 's - including @entity123 , @entity124 , and @entity125 - are obligated after the final warning to co-operate when rights holders wish to locate the consumer suspected of illegally downloading content ' i do n’t expect there to be universal acclaim , but it ’s a scheme that ’s fair , that ’s not punitive and that balances competing interests , ' he said			1
choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they do n't resort to illegal content			0
' we did a survey last year which found that a third of @entity4 download illegally , and more watch the illegal content , ' said ms @entity51			0
' when we asked people the reason they downloaded , 55 % said it was because of a lack of access , and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources , ' she said			0
' consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online , but that they are blocked from accessing it			0
it makes very little sense to them			0
' the code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which ' include continuing efforts of @entity253 to ensure timely and ready availability to @entity4 consumers of lawful content alternatives			1
' however , ms @entity51 said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as @entity206 available in @entity4 , the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed			0
choice is calling on communications minister @entity264 to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code , and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy			2
the @entity66 has been contacted for comment			0
choice is calling on communications minister @entity264 to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code			2

planned new code targets illegal downloading
the three - strike program sends warnings those suspected of the crime
after third warning , @entity17 must provide details of user to rights holders
this allows rights holders - @entity7 studios - to go after individual users
there is no limit on fines that could be *imposed* on those caught
consumer group choice has slammed the scheme calling it ' medieval '
