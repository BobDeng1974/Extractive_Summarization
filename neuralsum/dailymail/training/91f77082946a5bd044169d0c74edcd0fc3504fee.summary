@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 intends to use his axing from the side as a positive experience as he returns looking to prove he has benefited from the break			1
manager @entity6 said the @entity8 international would be sidelined for an ' indefinite ' period after dropping him for the match at @entity10 a fortnight ago			1
however , the 26 - year - old earned an unexpected reprieve when @entity13 was forced off with a thigh injury 15 minutes into the 1 - 0 @entity16 win at @entity17 , and @entity0 now looks set for a second chance against @entity19 on monday			1
@entity0 replaced @entity13 in the @entity1 goal on @entity16 , and is expected to continue he and @entity6 held a frank meeting in the manager 's office ahead of the @entity25 clash , and @entity0 went away to work on his game during his spell on the sidelines			1
while he has returned ahead of schedule , it does not mean he has not learned something from his exile			2
' we spoke together and cleared up a few things and i think that was a positive discussion , ' the @entity8 said			2
' i will not discuss what we spoke about , but it was an honest meeting - why not ? ' there is always a reason and discussion why , and i am a guy who always tries to speak and be positive and work hard on my game , and that is what i have done in this period with the goalie coach ( @entity47 ) and @entity48			2
@entity0 revealed he had tried to take positives from his time out of the @entity1 side @entity6 initially said he would drop @entity0 for an indefinite period of time ' sometimes you have to make something positive from a negative thing like going out of the team , which i 've tried to do			1
' it is always difficult at first but i am a 26 - year - old goalkeeper and i know what i have to work on , things in your game can still improve			2
' you can reflect on your game and look at certain things where maybe , with the busy period we 've had , you would n't have had the chance , and that is what i have done			2
' you learn a lot and you can move on and hopefully we can build on that			0
' i do n't have to prove anything			0
the only thing i can do is work hard and do my best and show what i am capable of on the pitch			0
' @entity0 was mercilessly taunted by @entity17 fans with almost every touch of the ball and he did not help himself by drilling one clearance into @entity78 and scrambling to claim the loose ball while somehow allowing a @entity81 backpass to run out for a corner before he attempted to kick it			1
@entity0 revealed he had been working hard in training with the goalkeeping coach and @entity13 @entity0 makes a save from @entity17 's @entity87 during their @entity16 clash but the goalkeeper , who has been under scrutiny all season , insists he does not hear the barracking , let alone allow it to affect him			1
' i do n't hear it			0
you get on with the game , ' he said			0
' when i was in the @entity8 second division , sometimes i played in front of 500 people and that is a lot more difficult than when you play in a ground with atmosphere because it is more difficult to focus yourself			0
' you just focus on the job in hand , saving the balls that come across you			0
' @entity111 counterpart @entity110 last week suggested it was a long and difficult road back after being dropped , but @entity0 rejected that suggestion			1
' that is his opinion - i do n't have to agree with it , ' he added			0
' you have to deal with the game how it comes			0
' i played 75 minutes and kept a clean sheet and we got three points ( at @entity17 )			1
i 'll see what happens in the next game			0
