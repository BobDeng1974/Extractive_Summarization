@entity1 gaming is entering the next generation			2
and perhaps no title shows just how far online warfare has evolved better than @entity5			0
this first - person shooter is a timed exclusive for @entity8 from @entity9 and @entity10 where players take sides choosing either the militia or @entity14 in a story - driven multiplayer experience			1
at @entity17 , @entity16 went hands - on in a 6 vs 6 match - up where as the @entity13 force , the team is sent to extract a pilot who is key to the resistance but are intercepted by the @entity14 ( @entity24 ) and a battle ensues			1
awesome : the battles are incredibly fun to play - especially when wielding some of the mechs ' weaponry at the beginning players are able to select the load - out of their character and their @entity32 ranging from @entity33 to short - range weaponry			1
the pace and gameplay @entity5 has to offer look superb			0
@entity32 ’s are on a timer and can be called in to stand and defend on their own or be entered and controlled by you , the player			1
@entity32 ’s are hugely powerful but also a big target for enemies , one of the more enjoyable tactics is flanking a @entity32 and jumping onto their backs to quickly deplete their health from close range			1
the maps can be traversed without having to touch the ground			0
players are able to jump , double jump , run along walls and easily travel along rooftops			0
this allows for another dimension of gameplay with many players seeking the best vantage point on the map			0
characters with have their own traits and progression with a lot of in - game context and storyline			2
one great addition is the new ending provided to the multiplayer game			0
in the game mode previewed , @entity67 , instead of a score limit being reached and people and kicked back to a lobby , @entity5 introduces the @entity72 ; the losing team must make their way to the dropship for extraction within a given time limit whilst the winning team has to hunt down the escaping losers before they make it			2
no boundaries : there is bucket - loads of character progression as well as an engrossing storyline a simple but ingenious addition gives a great turn on how to end a multiplayer fps experience			1
let us know what you think on @entity91 : @ @entity92 and on @entity93 : @entity16 .			0

incredibly fun and story - based combat , backed up with *stunning* *visuals*
@entity32 kills are *immensely* *satisfying*
*epilogue* mode is simple but *inspired*
