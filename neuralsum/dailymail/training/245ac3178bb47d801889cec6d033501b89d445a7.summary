by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:42 est , 27 february 2014 what property can you buy for £ 1 million ? not as much as you might think , depending on where you want to buy			1
a @entity7 real - estate site has revealed how much property you get for your million across the @entity7			0
a luxury cottage in @entity10 a converted church in @entity12 or a one bedroom apartment in @entity15 - geography seems to be the key to how much luxury pad you can purchase for £ 1,000,000			0
£ 1 million could see you living in this property in @entity15 , a reasonable sized flat with a kitchen nook , and a separate bathroom and bedroom			1
alternately you could buy a mansion elsewhere the living room in the @entity15 property does boast a lot of living room space due to the smaller size of the kitchen , and has room for its own small dining table bit of a squeeze : the kitchen in the @entity15 flat is a little on the small side , sacrificing the space of the kitchen for having a more open plan living room the bathroom clearly utilises an extensive use of mirrors to give it the impression of more space			2
the bathroom features a small sink , bath and toilet with tiled walls the bedroom has enough room to fit a bed and two small bedside tables , as well as a chest of drawers			0
the entire flat is more based around location than space the @entity15 flat sacrifices space for the convenience and location that the streets of @entity64 can provide £ 1 million will buy you just a one bedroom apartment in the heart of @entity15 , @entity68 , in between @entity69 and @entity70			1
the flat comprises a combined living and dining room , separate kitchen , good size bedroom and large bathroom			0
alternately , if you move to @entity12 you can purchase a unique 9 storey apartment in based in @entity78 , @entity79 , which covers the entire square footage of the clock tower			0
2500 sq ft of unique accomodation comes with a gym , sauna , and roof terrace on the top of the clock tower			0
the entire @entity89 church and all of its new mod cons are available to buy for a small £ 1 million , the same price that could get you a 20 room property elsewhere the church property : the dining room clearly shows the arches of the church design , with modern features such as glass tiled flooring and spot lighting the converted @entity89 church in @entity12 is significantly more opulent than what one could afford in @entity64 the kitchen of the church property , which features a glass tiled roof			1
the kitchen can be viewed from the dining room above it through the glass , and vice-versa the bedroom of the church property seems takes design risks such as a raised and sunken bed , in order to be more appealing to the buyer £ 1 million properties : the size of properties worth £ 1 million would appear to change depending on how far they are from cities			1
smaller properties are based in or near cities , like the property in @entity64 , while larger properties can be based in the peace and quiet of the country , like the @entity10 property in @entity131 , @entity132 , £ 1million would get you this idyllic five bed , three - story , detached house in the hills			1
the converted @entity139 house 's glass windows boasts views over the water to @entity142 - there is a luxurious wood burner in the living room and double doors looking out over the water			0
the living room of the @entity131 property , which boasts riverside views , as well as views of a bridge further down the river			0
the house seems like a new build and has several different mod cons that reflect this the property also features a large garden and deck that looks out over a harbour near @entity142 the @entity132 property also features its own route to the riverside , and a small rock jetty that protrudes from the hillside the bedroom in the north @entity168 property has it 's own little balcony , and dwarfs other smaller properties , being almost double the size as bedrooms in flats and houses in @entity64 the property features a few spare rooms that can be used for multiple functions			1
the advertiser has decided to opt for a pool table in an attempt to re-purpose it as a rec room the @entity132 property features many rooms , but most have a view of the river , or architecturally significant bridge a short way down the river you can always tell the size of a place immediately by the size of its entrance and hallway			0
this one is massive , which makes it likely that so is the house in @entity202 in @entity10 you can snap up a 20 - room state - of - the - art four bed cottage			2
the detached family villa with a 4 - car garage and staff flat is within easy reach of @entity209 and has a three acre woodland to the north of the house			0
a property in @entity202 in @entity10 features 20 rooms , one of which is a classically @entity10 wooden snooker room that looks over the large amount of land that comes with the property larch cottage in @entity10 also boasts a small wooded area to the rear of the property , as well as a bird cage and several acres of land much of the property in @entity10 is lined with wooden panelling , mixing the newer styles of fittings , such as a gym , with the older style of using wood as a wall and ceiling surface the @entity10 cottage is a newer build that attempts to capture a flair of old - style design , and has heavy emphasis on recreation and entertainment rooms the bedroom is a much more pre-fab modern design than other bedrooms in properties worth £ 1 million or more			1
the price of some properties increases because of size , whereas other property prices increase because of location the property also has a cinema room for those who decide that going to the cinema is too expensive after they have paid £ 1 million for their house the @entity10 property also has a small garage that could easily function as a guest house the kitchen has a large island to both do cooking and eat at leisure , with large fridges and cupboards the @entity7 real estate market rarely has buyers of £ 1 million or more , which is why these sorts of properties are so rare , and also tend to sell a lot slower alternatively you could multiply your million and buy 12 apartments in @entity276 , @entity12			1
the pair of grand @entity279 semi-detached properties are converted into one and two bed apartments and are fully let - generating £ 70,000 a year			0
the flats , if fully occupied , could possibly generate around £ 70,000 a year , meaning you could earn your investment back in around 10 or 11 years an alternative to buying a house for yourself is buying property to rent out			2
by buying this property in @entity12 , you could turn the floors into flats and rent it out the @entity12 flats a re a lot more like an investment than a place to live , causing a potential buyer to spend a lot more money doing up the flats than they might by just buying a house for themselves in @entity298 you can become the owners of a nine bedroom manor house in the @entity302 hills			1
built in 1450 this beautiful manor house in a tiny village is straight out of a romance novel			1
the huge property has mullioned windows , four foot thick walls , numerous fireplaces , exposed beams and flagstone flooring			0
the @entity279 property based in @entity302 , just outside of @entity298 , is likely marketed at someone who appreciates the tastes and styles of the @entity279 era , as the house is crammed head to toe with memorabilia from @entity7 's era of empire the property in @entity298 , @entity302 , is a lot more of a cosy affair			2
it features plush ornaments and wooden beams , with the expensive price being based on the age and size of the property rather than the location the property follows a very @entity279 theme , reflecting the time it was built and a buyer will likely be someone who enjoys the sort of taste that the advertising displays with nine bedrooms and several reception rooms , the property would be perfect for entertaining guests who have similar tastes around a roaring fire on a cold winter 's evening the @entity302 property is a lot more rustic , with older features including an aga a giant dining table , and flagstone floors the property also features a large garden , with the advert displaying a manicured lawn that would probably require a lot of work to maintain the @entity302 house is situated in a cosy village that is only a short distance from @entity298 , giving it the pleasures of the country with the convenience of being near the city the bedrooms are spread across the wide property , which would make it incredibly quiet if there were a smaller amount of people living at the house @entity375 is one of @entity7 's biggest websites for property searches in the @entity7 , where you can find out what you can buy for £ 1million in 2014			1
@entity381 from property site @entity375 , said : ' there are currently nearly 800 homes on right move priced at exactly £ 1million , and these examples show just how much location can determine what you can get for your money			2
' a recent survey found that 90 % of people were n't willing to compromise on location , but whether your budget is £ 100,000 or £ 1million			2
' by broadening your search to include different are as you might find that you 're able to get more of the features that are on your home moving wish list			0

property website found people were rarely willing to sacrifice location for price
what property you can get for £ 1 million is hugely different depending on location
£ 1 million could get you a 20 room manor house in @entity302 , or a small apartment in @entity64
