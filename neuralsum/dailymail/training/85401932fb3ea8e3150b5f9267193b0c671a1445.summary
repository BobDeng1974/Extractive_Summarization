it was a @entity1 family outing as @entity2 and her parents attended a high society wedding in rural @entity5 - and there was even room for boyfriend @entity8			1
two of @entity2 's oldest friends , @entity9 and @entity11 , were tying the knot at the lavish ceremony in @entity14			1
@entity15 of @entity17 's 30 - year - old sister was accompanied by her investment banker boyfriend @entity18 , as rumours of their own engagement remain rife			1
@entity22 was at the wedding of two of her closest friends , @entity9 and @entity11 @entity2 , left , attended with boyfriend @entity18 , right , which will fuel rumours of their own engagement @entity9 did n't let the rain put a dampener of her big day as she tied the knot with fiance @entity11 all smiles : @entity1 beams as she arrives at the lavish ceremony dressed in a stylish red jacket and beige hat with her husband @entity35 , right @entity2 has a laugh with her father , centre , and mother , second from right ( obscured ) @entity18 lays a hand on his girlfriend 's back as they wait by the church , attending the ceremony together will just fuel rumours that they may marry in the near future @entity2 , kneeling centre , and @entity9 , directly to her left , at @entity54 cooking school where they met the website of @entity56 , the catering company run by @entity9 , after several years of working in a number of different sectors @entity2 , who came to the wedding wearing a cat dress by @entity61 and with a bag by @entity63 , met @entity9 on a course at the prestigious £ 3,600 - a - month cookery school @entity54 , in @entity66 , @entity67			1
@entity2 attended the culinary college on her gap - year before university and the two have remained close since			2
@entity9 , who is is the goddaughter of brigadier @entity71 , lord lieutenant for @entity14 and @entity72 , is a well - known member of the royal set and a close friend of @entity76 and @entity22			1
however , with their @entity79 tour barely over , they were not at the ceremony			2
born and raised on her family 's grand estate in the @entity84 , @entity9 is fond of outdoor pursuits , an interest she shares with @entity2			1
she has worked in a number of industries , including travel , property and pr and also runs her own freelance catering firm , @entity93			0
if there 's one styling trick a @entity1 sister can nail with her eyes shut , it 's going matchy matchy			2
and @entity100 did n't disappoint with her latest outfit , as she attended a friend ’s wedding wearing the most coordinated outfit we 've seen all year			1
the @entity106 would be proud ( and @entity107 jealous )			0
@entity2 opted for a light green coat dress , which she teamed with an olive green fascinator , and matching bag and shoes			0
muted green shades were a strong fixture at the @entity115 shows , with the hue adoring dresses , suits , coats and accessories alike at @entity120 , @entity122 @entity121			0
while the shade of @entity2 's dress flatters her sun kissed skin to perfection , we 're sad to say the shape just is n't doing her figure any favours			0
the round neck and empire line is a style favoured by wedding going grandmothers , not a 30 - something socialite with a host of fashion 's most coveted collections at her fingertips			2
instead @entity2 should have chosen a style which shows off her trim figure , such as a smart shift or a 50s style which nips her in at the waist			0
@entity2 , we recommend that you raid @entity22 's suitcase for outfit inspiration as soon as she arrives home from @entity152			0
while the colour of @entity2 's outfitted suited her sun - kissed complexion , the shape was not her most flattering look @entity158 , son of the @entity159 , left , was another guest at the high - profile wedding , many of the guests were also personal friends of @entity2 @entity8 and @entity2 have been together for about 18 months			1
the couple recently returned from a skiing trip at an exclusive @entity166 resort @entity2 has been with @entity8 , 36 , for 18 - months and their increasing number of cosy public appearances are fuelling suspicions that they could be ready to get married themselves			2
only last month , the couple holidayed with @entity8 ’s grandparents at luxury ski resort @entity174 in the @entity176			0
the destination is so glamorous that even the ski - lifts are sponsored by luxury brands such as @entity180 and @entity181			0
@entity2 met @entity8 , originally from @entity182 , @entity183 , who made his millions at @entity186 , on a previous skiing trip			0
while @entity2 , right , attended the wedding of @entity9 and @entity11			1
@entity76 and @entity22 were not present , although are said to also be close friends of the couple it seemed to be a family trip with @entity1 and @entity193 also present , although @entity22 and @entity194 did not seen to be at the ceremony the @entity1 parents seemed to be enjoying themselves at the lavish event , left , as did @entity2 and @entity198 , right , who seemed very relaxed with one another @entity2 wore an olive green outfit to attend the wedding where guests included many members of high society and the royal set @entity158 at the ceremony , left , he will inherit the @entity207 of @entity208 , which was used as @entity209 in the @entity211 films @entity2 seemed totally at ease at the wedding and all the guests were enjoying the celebrations @entity1 and @entity193 with another guest at the wedding @entity2 strolling through the @entity84 estate where the wedding of two of her closest friends took place something seems to have caught @entity2 's eye as she pulls a face at the wedding			1
