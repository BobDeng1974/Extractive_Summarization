by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 17:01 est , 19 january 2013 @entity1 rating : @entity3 films and i have never really got on , and it ’s partly because the sort of films that inspired him when he was growing up are , by and large , ones i do n’t like at all			1
but then came news that his latest project was a spaghetti western and it seemed all was perhaps not lost : i rather like spaghetti westerns			0
and , to my astonishment , i loved @entity1			1
yes , it ’s buttock - numbingly long and , yes , it lives up to its 18 certificate for ‘ strong , bloody violence ’ but it ’s still the best film he ’s made for years			2
it reunites him with the superlative @entity20 ( unforgettable as the charming , psychopathic @entity21 in @entity22 ) , benefits from a wonderful supporting performance from @entity25 and stands real comparison with the films that made @entity3 deservedly famous : reservoir dogs and @entity29			1
double act : @entity1 sees , @entity20 as dr @entity1 , left , a bounty hunter who asks freed slave @entity31 for help it takes its title from 1966 spaghetti @entity36 , directed by @entity37 and starring the @entity39 actor @entity38 , now married to @entity40			1
there ’s a lovely moment when @entity38 makes a brief cameo appearance in the new film			0
‘ the @entity45 is silent , ’ explains the new @entity31			0
‘ i know , ’ replies the old one quietly			0
when @entity3 , who writes as well as directs , is getting the little details so wonderfully right , you know he ’s on good form			1
that sentimental aside apart , however , this is a new story with @entity53 playing @entity31 , a black slave in the @entity55 two years before the @entity56 , and @entity20 taking on the role of dr @entity1 , the sharp - shooting ‘ dentist ’ who so unexpectedly frees him from his chains and offers him a deal			2
if @entity31 will help him track down the @entity64 brothers , notoriously brutal plantation overseers and now wanted men , he will give him his freedom			0
as these are the same @entity64 brothers who branded and humiliated @entity31 and whipped and then sold his beautiful slave wife , he does n’t take long to say ‘ yes ’			0
acting out : @entity31 meets charismatic plantation - owner @entity71 , played by @entity25 in fact , he takes to the bounty - hunting business , as dr @entity75 ’s true vocation is soon revealed to be , with murderous alacrity : ‘ kill white folk and they pay you for it , ’ he exclaims , ‘ what ’s not to like ? ’ the first hour of @entity1 is close to perfect , with @entity20 , undoubtedly drawing on his inglourious style , making the linguistically fastidious @entity75 the most interesting and entertaining character @entity3 has written in a long time , while @entity53 provides menace , presence and humour as the much - wronged @entity31			1
captivating : @entity53 in @entity1 this is a film about revenge , and when the bad guys get what ’s coming , as they do ever more frequently , they certainly deserve it			1
@entity3 ’s screenplay , which has already secured him an @entity96 nomination and won him a @entity97 , is spot - on in the first half , delighting in word play and the sort of humour that the @entity103 team or @entity104 , in the days of @entity105 , would have loved			2
a scene in which a @entity108 lynch - mob have to rethink their murderous plans because they ca n’t see out of the eye - holes cut in their hoods is surely destined to become as famous as @entity114 ’s and @entity117 ’s @entity116 routine in @entity29			0
watch out for @entity119 ’s brief cameo as the splendidly sulky clan man whose wife sewed the hoods and , indeed , for @entity114 , a @entity3 regular , as a voluble house slave			2
@entity3 is a great one for dividing his film into acts and there ’s no doubt the pace slows considerably as @entity129 begins with @entity75 and @entity31 setting off to find @entity31 ’s wife , the gloriously named @entity130 ( @entity131 )			1
this change of gear proved close to disastrous in @entity22 but works a lot better here , thanks to @entity25 ’s captivating turn as the charismatic plantation - owner @entity71 , who likes to be called @entity139 by his slaves but monsieur @entity141 by his white peers			0
a lot of speechifying by fine southern gentlemen and the growing suspicion that the actors might be having more fun than we are will be a test for some , but the verbal pyrotechnics are a @entity3 trademark , @entity25 has never been better and , best of all , there is , of course , some serious shooting to come			2
there is no point being po - faced about the violence ; this is a @entity159 , for goodness sake			0
what ’s more disconcerting is hearing the now taboo ‘ n - word ’ being used over and over again			0
but this is that rare thing , a @entity3 film where the maverick director gets just about all of the big judgment calls right .			1
