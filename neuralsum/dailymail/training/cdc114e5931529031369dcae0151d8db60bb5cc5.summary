@entity9 , who was injured in the explosion almost four years ago , said he 's looking forward to driving and swimming after undergoing the operation			1
' i just want to get the most out of these arms , and just as goals come up , knock them down and take it absolutely as far as i can , ' @entity9 said yesterday			1
the 26 - year - old @entity17 spoke at a news conference at @entity19 , where he was joined by surgeons who performed the arduous and complex 13 - hour operation			1

@entity9 said his chief desire is to drive the black @entity49 that 's been sitting in his garage for three years			1
' i used to love to drive , ' he said			2
' i 'm really looking forward to just getting back to that , and just becoming an athlete again			2
' surgeons at @entity55 in performing double arm transplant on @entity57 attach one of the transplanted limbs ( center circle ) intense concentration : this photograph from december 18th shows the surgical team at @entity19 during their 13 - hour operation on @entity9 the team at @entity34 physicians perform the @entity19 's first bilateral arm transplant on 26 - year - old patient @entity57 although he does n't expect to excel at soccer , his favorite sport , @entity9 said he 'd like to swim and compete in a marathon using a hand - cycle			1
@entity9 joked that military service members sometimes regard themselves as poorly paid professional athletes			1
his good humor and optimism are among the qualities doctors cited as signs he will recover much of his arm and hand use in two to three years			2
' he 's a young man with a tremendous amount of hope , and he 's stubborn - stubborn in a good way , ' said dr. @entity84 , the hospital 's clinical director of hand transplantation			2
' i think the sky 's the limit			2
' shores said @entity9 has already been trying to use his hands , although he lacks feeling in the fingers , and he 's eager to do more as the slow - growing nerves and muscles mend			1
' i suspect that he will be using his hands for just about everything as we let him start trying to do more and more			0
right now , we 're the ones really kind of holding him back at this point , ' @entity84 said			0
the procedure was only the seventh double - hand or double - arm transplant ever done in the @entity101			1
the infantryman was injured by a roadside bomb in 2009			1
he is the first soldier to survive losing all four limbs in the @entity5			1

a surgical team led by @entity34 physicians performed the institution 's first bilateral arm transplant on 18 december 2012 @entity9 marroccolost his four limbs in a 2009 roadside bomb attack in @entity5			1
with him are @entity124 's @entity126 director w.p. @entity125 ( right ) and @entity124 's @entity128 program scientific director @entity127 ( left ) @entity105 wheels himself into a news conference followed by surgeons , ( from left , @entity132 @entity125 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 ) on tuesday , january 29th 2013 at @entity19 in @entity109 @entity9 also received bone marrow from the same donor to minimize the medicine needed to prevent rejection			1
he said he did n't know much about the donor but ' i 'm humbled by their gift			0
' the 13 - hour operation on december 18th was led by dr. w.p. @entity125 , plastic surgery chief at @entity19			1
- @entity9 was being released from the hospital tuesday but will receive intensive therapy for two years at @entity19 and then at @entity149 in @entity150			1
after a major surgery , human nerves regenerate at a rate of an inch per month , @entity125 said			0
' the progress will be slow , but the outcome will be rewarding , ' he added			0
the infantryman also received bone marrow from the same dead donor who supplied his new arms			0
that novel approach is aimed at helping his body accept the new limbs with minimal medication to prevent rejection			2
the military sponsors operations like these to help wounded troops			0
about 300 have lost arms or hands in @entity5 or @entity171			1
@entity132 @entity125 , @entity133 talks about the bilateral arm transplant on @entity174 during the news conference today unlike a life - saving heart or liver transplant , limb transplants are aimed at improving quality of life , not extending it			1
quality of life is a key concern for people missing arms and hands â€” prosthetics for those limbs are not as advanced as those for feet and legs			2
' he was the first quad amputee to survive , ' and there have been four others since then , @entity192 said			0
the @entity197 want to thank the donor 's family for ' making a selfless decision ... making a difference in @entity9 's life , ' the father said			1

@entity125 led three of those earlier operations when he worked at the @entity214 , including the only above - elbow transplant that had been done at the time , in 2010			1
@entity9 's ' was the most complicated one ' so far , @entity125 said in an interview monday			2
it will take more than a year to know how fully @entity218 will be able to use the new arms			0
' the maximum speed is an inch a month for nerve regeneration , ' he explained			0
' we 're easily looking at a couple years ' until the full extent of recovery is known			0
while at @entity226 , @entity125 pioneered the immune - suppression approach used for @entity9			1
the surgeon led hand - transplant operations on five patients , giving them marrow from their donors in addition to the new limbs			1
all five recipients have done well , and four have been able to take just one anti-rejection drug instead of combination treatments most transplant patients receive			2
minimizing anti-rejection drugs is important because they have side effects and raise the risk of cancer over the long term			0
those risks have limited the willingness of surgeons and patients to do more hand , arm and even face transplants			0
@entity125 has received funding for his work from @entity252 , the @entity252 , a cooperative research network of top hospitals and universities around the country that the government formed about five years ago			0
with government money , he and several other plastic surgeons around the country are preparing to do more face transplants , possibly using the new immune - suppression approach			2
@entity9 has become the first quadruple amputee injured in @entity264 to have a double arm transplant @entity9 pictured around 10 - months after he was injured in a roadside explosion in @entity5 - clearly visible is the scar running along his carotid artery @entity9 relaxes on duty in @entity5 before his devastating accident in april 2009 @entity9 expects to spend three to four months at @entity19 , then return to a military hospital to continue physical therapy , his father said			1
before the operation , he had been fitted with prosthetic legs and had learned to walk on his own			0
he had been living with his older brother in a specially equipped home on @entity17 's @entity25 that had been built with the help of several charities			0
shortly after moving in , he said it was ' a relief to not have to rely on other people so much			0
' the home was heavily damaged by @entity285 last fall			0
despite being in a lot of pain for some time after the operation , @entity9 showed a sense of humor , his father said			2
he had a hoarse voice from the tube that was in his throat during the long surgery and decided he sounded like @entity295			0
he soon started doing movie lines			0
' he was making the nurses laugh , ' @entity192 said .			0

@entity9 lost all four limbs in roadside blast in @entity5 in april , 2009
