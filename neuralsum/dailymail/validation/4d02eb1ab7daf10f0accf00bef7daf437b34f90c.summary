it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			2
@entity4 has hit the ground running in @entity6 and @entity8 's celebration was a knockout			1
but @entity10 are staring at successive relegations and questions remain about @entity15 's @entity14 squad			1
what 's hot @entity4 the former @entity18 forward is @entity19 ’s captain and lit up @entity20 in front of 45,000 last weekend , scoring one and making one			1
meanwhile , @entity24 has played precisely two hours of @entity26 football since choosing @entity27 over @entity6 in december			2
@entity4 scored for @entity6 against @entity28 last weekend @entity8 great goal against @entity30 , great celebration too			1
after news of his kitchen boxing match with @entity36 appeared in the @entity37 , though , there are lessons			2
choose friends you can trust and never again be caught wearing white socks anywhere other than on a tennis court			2
@entity8 responded to a leaked video of him boxing with a knockout celebration against @entity30 @entity8 fell to the @entity46 turf as if he had been knocked out , as appeared to be the case in the video @entity49 interviews by broadcast sports journalists can occasionally lack a little depth but @entity54 ’s stalwart came off his long run when questioning national selector @entity56 on the @entity58 issue this week			0
it was captivating work , born of courage and great experience			0
@entity63 a good footballer but even better person , the former @entity14 player has kept cancer at bay for 12 years now and has raised thousands in the process			1
if his decision to ride several tour stages with @entity73 this summer does not please everyone i am sure he will cope			1
@entity75 ( right ) plans to cycle several stages of the @entity78 this summer with @entity73 what 's not @entity10 five years ago this week @entity80 witnessed a 4 - 1 destruction of @entity82			1
now @entity10 are threatened with relegation from the championship , having won once in thirteen games			2
this is what happens when you choose the wrong managers			0
@entity10 's 3 - 0 defeat to @entity91 in midweek left the @entity92 mired in a relegation battle in the championship five years ago , @entity10 beat @entity82 at @entity80 en - route to the @entity96 final @entity15 an @entity14 squad with almost as many left - backs ( three ) as strikers ( four ) suggests @entity15 is about to experiment with 7 - 2 - 1 against @entity100 or does n’t actually know where @entity101 plays			1
it ’s a dispiriting selection and tells us all we need to know about our prospects at @entity106			0
@entity107 @entity110 cricket ’s sense of self - pity has now spread to those who have n’t even been playing			0
@entity113 should realise that although the decision to appoint @entity116 as @entity118 captain was n’t right , it does n’t mean that jettisoning him beforehand was necessarily wrong			0
@entity119 after his dropped catch eased @entity124 ’s passage to the last four of the @entity118 , the young @entity121 fielder looked shell shocked but the worst is yet to come			0
at some point in the coming weeks , young @entity125 will have to go home			0
@entity121 's @entity125 drops a catch as @entity121 were knocked out of the @entity118 by @entity124			0

@entity4 scored one and *created* one against @entity28
@entity75 will not be *fazed* by *criticism* surrounding @entity73
five years on from beating @entity82 , @entity10 *slumped* to another defeat
@entity15 picked three left backs in his latest @entity14 squad
