by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 03:20 est , 30 january 2013 warning : headteacher @entity1 says some parents praise their daughters too much parents are turning their daughters into ‘ little princesses ’ who ca n’t take criticism , the head teacher of a leading girls ’ grammar school warned yesterday			1
@entity1 said some families treat daughters as if they ‘ can do no wrong ’ and constantly shower them with praise and presents , as a result , many lack the ‘ resilience ’ to deal with failure or criticism , she said			1
mrs @entity1 , who is head of one of the best selective schools in the country , spoke out ahead of a conference at her school in @entity25 , @entity26 - attended by parents and other school leaders - about educating teenage girls			1
‘ what i try to address with my parents here is the concept of what we call the little princess , which is one where a child , once she ’s satisfied her parents ’ ambitions to get into the school , she can do no wrong , ’ she said , ‘ she ’s constantly praised - and that is not necessarily a good thing			1
’ mrs @entity1 , who has a grown - up son , said that ‘ the little princess ’ always wants to please and gets ‘ a lot of rewards ’ for her troubles			1
she said : ‘ for some of them it ’s just praise , but with others they can have more or less what they want			0
‘ their parents shower them with presents			0
’ she said some parents ‘ never exposed ’ their daughters to any negative feedback			1
this made girls into ‘ perfectionists ’ who would not take risks in case they failed			1
instead of excessive praise , she said , parents should ensure their daughters were ‘ strong individuals ’ who could cope with failure and grow up to be leaders			1
‘ our girls are bright and therefore , they will be leaders , ’ she said			2
‘ as a leader , you ’re not a princess			0
as a leader , you ’ve got to have strength , belief , resilience			0
‘ you have to have the right principles - you must be principled , but you must have knowledge			0
‘ all those things do n’t necessarily go with being a princess because a princess is a bit fragile			2
‘ a princess receives information , learns it , regurgitates it , but never gets truly challenged			0
’ ' perfectionists ' : mrs @entity1 said some parents have ' never exposed ' their daughters to risk meaning they are afraid of failure ( file photo ) mrs @entity1 is head of the 900 - pupil @entity94 , where 88 per cent of pupils pass their gcses with @entity97 or a * s last summer			1
her comments were echoed by dr @entity100 , author of @entity98 : raising confident and @entity102			0
speaking at the conference yesterday , she said many parents ‘ tend to go overboard on praise ’ , making girls ‘ feel precious ’ and that they ’re ‘ the centre of the universe ’			2
praise should be ‘ specific and earned ’ instead , she said			0
referring to daughters , the @entity111 psychologist said : ‘ as a parent , you ’ll obviously offer general praise to her sometimes , but if you do it too often , your opinion will not be valued			2
‘ remember too , that the more she focuses on self , the more selfish she will become ; whereas the more she focuses on doing and on others , the more she will increase her self esteem			0
’ conference : the comments by mrs @entity1 came ahead of a conference at her school in @entity25 , @entity26 , about educating teenage girls earlier this month a leading psychologist warned that praising children with phrases such as ‘ well done darling ’ could damage their confidence			1
@entity130 says ‘ empty praise ’ such as ‘ you ’re so clever ’ or ‘ you ’re such an artist ’ could cause children to be unhappy as they feel they can not live up to the false expectations , and can even hinder their progress at school			2
mr @entity130 - who has practised as a psychoanalyst , a type of psychologist , for 25 years - cites research showing that children who were heavily praised were likely to perform worse in maths problems and even tended to lie about their results			0
instead he advises parents and teachers to bestow compliments less frequently and use phrases that congratulate children for ‘ trying really hard ’ .			0
