it seems appropriate that the @entity2 city famed for its heat should stage a match between @entity7 football ’s most fierce rivals			2
the suggestion that the @entity10 final of this @entity11 , contested by @entity12 and @entity13 , will be a friendly affair seems wishful			1
for each team it marks an opportunity to flex muscles and score an early boost ahead of the season proper			1
for once , @entity12 will enter from the more humble position with @entity13 looking down			1
@entity13 have lost @entity38 but @entity39 is acquiring plenty of players to compensate			1
here are how the best starting line - ups currently available to either boss might look and rate			0
moving on : @entity13 boss @entity39 will be without @entity38 following his sale to @entity46 in july @entity47 : 3 - 5 - 2 july 26 : beat @entity48 3 - 2 - @entity49 july 29 : @entity51 0 - 0 @entity50 ( pens win ) - @entity53 august 2 : beat @entity54 3 - 1 - @entity55 @entity56 : 83 @entity57 8.5 one player to emerge from last season ’s wreckage with an enhanced reputation and looks in prime nick			1
capable of stunning saves and increasingly commanding of his area			0
safe hands : @entity69 's unquestionable shot - stopping makes his @entity12 's no 1 @entity71 - 6.5 has suffered from operating at right back through necessity during his time at @entity33 but @entity24 ’s new system offers him a chance to flourish at centre back			1
up for it : @entity71 ( left ) has finally got the chance to flourish at centre - back in @entity27 's team @entity84 - 7 at 26 , he is now the elder statesman of @entity12 ’s defence since the departures of @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 and is being considered for a captaincy role			1
big responsibility on his shoulders			0
veteran : at 26 , @entity84 ( left ) is @entity12 's oldest and most experienced centre back @entity95 - 6.5 another who has not kicked on as hoped , partly through being shuffled around the pitch			1
central defence has always looked his most natural position so now has a regular opportunity to fulfill that potential			0
crunching challenge : like @entity71 , @entity95 ( left ) will get a chance to shine at centre back @entity105 - 7.5 able to slot seamlessly into the right wing back slot by virtue of his strength , pace and stamina			0
one of the players you imagine @entity24 would be able to improve in a formation that may suit			0
reborn : @entity105 ( left ) looks tailor - made for the right wing back role under @entity24 @entity116 - 7 must get his fitness up to peak standard before he can become the marauding wing back @entity12 desperately need			2
his powerful running should add dynamism to the left flank			0
star in the making : @entity12 paid @entity126 £ 31million for @entity116 ( top ) this summer @entity128 - 7.5 ankle injury will rule him out for the opening weeks of the season but once back will bring much - required experience and link from defence to attack			1
@entity24 wants his players to be rounded individuals and he fits that mould			0
early blow : @entity128 will miss the start of @entity12 's season after undergoing ankle surgery @entity138 - 8 has shown in an impressive pre-season how he can provide drive and creativity from midfield			1
expressive on the pitch and off it , and entering his prime at 24 years old			0
@entity147 : @entity138 ( centre ) has fitted seamlessly in @entity12 's first - team since his move from @entity151 @entity152 - 8.5 @entity12 ’s midfield produced an alarmingly slim amount of goals in recent years but the @entity156 seems likely to continue where he left off at the end of last season			1
@entity161 presence with cutting edge			0
revitalised : @entity152 ( centre ) scored in @entity12 's 3 - 2 pre-season win against @entity48 in july @entity22 - 8 no chance of him being shifted to the left in @entity24 ’s preferred formation			2
striker will be in his preferred role and that clarity could yield big results			0
this could be a defining season , with a manager who will neither pander nor ostracise			2
point to prove : @entity22 is in contention to be @entity27 's captain next season @entity180 - 8 once recuperated from @entity181 he should be back to his best under the compatriot with whom he shares a strong bond			1
produced magical moments in @entity186 and threatens to return to form of 2012 - 13			0
top dog : @entity24 's hopes @entity189 replicates his @entity192 @entity181 form in a @entity12 shirt next season @entity195 happy with squad july 27 : beat @entity197 1 - 0 - @entity198 july 30 : @entity51 2 - 2 @entity199 ( pens win ) - @entity201 august 2 : beat @entity202 2 - 0 - @entity203 @entity13 - formation : 4 - 3 - 3 @entity56 : 83.5 @entity204 - 6.5 coped reasonably well with making the step up to a club chasing the title last term but must increase his level of command			1
an excellent shot - stopper but is liable to mistakes howler			0
step up : @entity204 has to work on commanding his area in the @entity13 box @entity215 - 6 the influx of full backs , his form , and his age - 29 - combine to put his place at jeopardy			2
with one year left on his contract @entity13 might cash in			2
but as things stand he has the right - back slot			0
under pressure : @entity215 ( left ) faces competition for a starting spot at right back for @entity13 @entity230 - 7.5 got his way with move from @entity126 but now must prove worth the £ 20m price - tag and all the fuss			2
a commanding defender who could fill void left by @entity237			0
all smiles : @entity230 joined @entity13 in a £ 20million transfer last month from @entity126 @entity240 - 8 showed enough at @entity181 to suggest he could become @entity39 ' no 1 centre back			1
troubled by injury last season but provides pace and power as well as being comfortable on the ball			2
beast : @entity240 's pace and power makes him a welcome addition to @entity39 ' defence @entity253 - 7.5 academy graduate became a cult hero on @entity256 for his fearless displays last season but his position comes under threat from @entity261 ’s imminent arrival			1
could switch to right back			0
cult hero : @entity253 ( second right ) endeared himself to the @entity266 last season with his fearless displays @entity267 - 7.5 at 34 is spurred on by the worst three months of his career			2
errors cost @entity13 and @entity271 but he will thrive on driving through @entity39 ’ evolution and leading his club in @entity275 once more			1
captain marvel : @entity267 ( left ) will be hoping to skipper @entity13 to their first - ever @entity278 title @entity279 - 8 a revelation last term , bringing energy , smart passing and occasional goals to @entity13 ’s midfield			1
despite reinforcements should keep his place as a box - to - box player			0
mr energy : @entity279 's ( left ) box - to - box qualities make him play a pivotal role in @entity13 's midfield @entity293 - 8.5 a little gem of a player at the point of midfield			2
operates in the spaces between the lines and , with @entity38 departed , will be looked upon to provide the magic that unlocks tight defences			0
clever clogs : @entity13 boss @entity39 has hailed @entity293 ( right ) as the ' brain of the team ' @entity306 - 7.5 has never appeared daunted in his career , be it @entity278 football with @entity126 or his debut for @entity271			1
now has stage to show off his talents although it will be intriguing to see how he is used			0
mystery man : £ 25million summer signing @entity306 ( left ) will miss the start of the season through injury @entity318 - 8.5 emerged from dips last season to become a vital player in the run - in , capable of adapting from the wing to the middle			2
his decision making is improving while natural skills and speed a match for anyone			0
one to watch : @entity318 ( right ) performances at @entity13 earned him a @entity181 spot this summer @entity332 - 8 scored the goals this time last season when @entity38 was suspended and must now repeat			1
how he adjusts to role as premier striker will be interesting but chances are he will progress again			0
instinctive : @entity332 ( left ) will be expected to score the majority of @entity13 's goals this season @entity341 @entity13 v @entity199 highlights			1

@entity12 face @entity13 in the @entity11 final
*tuesday* 's final will see @entity27 face @entity39 for first time
