education chiefs in @entity38 , the @entity39 county where it took place , have launched an investigation into the teaching of sex in schools because the attack was carried out just after a sex education class			1
a @entity49 spokesman said : ' as soon as this serious allegation was brought to our attention , the matter was immediately referred to @entity54 for investigation			1
' now that the legal process has been concluded , we will be working with @entity54 and other relevant partners to carry out a detailed review of the incident to identify whether there are any lessons to be learned			0
' safeguarding the welfare of the county 's children is a key priority for @entity49 and our partners			1
' when an allegation is presented to us that a young person may have been the victim of a crime , we have detailed processes in place that are then followed in accordance with the relevant all @entity39 child protection procedures			2
' the sexual attack came to light a year after the incident when a school nurse realised the young girl appeared unhappy			1
she asked if anything was worrying her and the teenage girl told her about the rape			1
the boy is now in foster care and no longer lives in the area			0

most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum			2
but thousands of academies , free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum , meaning they are free to drop the subject			0
provision in primary schools is also patchy , with most not teaching anything until the final years			0
this year the @entity98 announced plans to force all state schools , including primaries , to teach sex education			2
@entity104 ’s schools minister @entity103 committed the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘ good citizens ’			2
the move , backed by @entity111 but opposed by the @entity112 , would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer			2
countries such as the @entity118 and @entity119 have been held up as examples of a more liberal and open attitude to sex education than the @entity123			0
in the @entity118 , sex and relationship education begins in primary schools for children as young as six			0
it has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world			0
@entity123 parents retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education classes , and surveys have frequently shown that many oppose school sex education for young children			1
because district judge @entity23 decided not send him to @entity142 , where there are higher sentencing powers , the 12 - month referral order was the maximum sentence he was able to give			1

some parts of sex and relationship education are compulsory and these biological aspects of sexual maturity and intercourse are part of the national curriculum for science			0
secondary school pupils are taught about relationships , love and care and the responsibilities of parenthood as well as safe sex and contraception			2
guidelines state classes must focus on boys as much as girls , build self - esteem , teach the responsibility and consequences of sexual activity and parenthood and ensure young people understand how the law applies to sexual relationships			0
@entity186 , from rape survivor charity @entity184 , said anecdotal evidence showed the rape of young teenagers by friends was ' not uncommon '			0
ms @entity186 said : ' the fact it happened after a sex education class i am sure gives concern about the teaching of sex education in school			1
' i would say it highlights the importance of teaching sex and relationship education in schools that focuses not just on the biology and mechanics of sex but about emotions and consent , respect and relationships			0
' it is only through genuine education , and much earlier than 13 i would say , that we can help stop this happening			0
