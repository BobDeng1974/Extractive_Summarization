so what about financial fair play ? it was n’t mentioned as part of the great leap forward and the @entity5 does have very strict views on this			1
there are percentages of turnover that can be paid as salary - 55 per cent in @entity11 , 60 per cent in @entity12 - and huge punishments for clubs that fail to comply			1
and into this forest of red tape and limitation , @entity16 chairman @entity15 wishes to introduce clubs that can not be bound by those rules for , if they were , they would undoubtedly fail			1
the @entity24 b teams would include players earning far in excess of the norm for the competition and have financial structures that bear no relation to those of the standard lower league club			1
vision for the future : @entity16 chairman @entity15 speaks after revealing the commission 's findings to b , or not to @entity38 ? an animated @entity15 outlines his vision for the future of @entity42 football for the bottom line is that @entity38 do not really exist			1
not as a real club with a board and an independent revenue stream , and sponsors and advertisers , supporters and a gate and salaries that conform to the limitations of @entity11			0
so to expect @entity53 to be tied to @entity5 regulations on expenditure , while playing against a striker earning £ 25,000 a week whose owners are not party to the same rules , is entirely unfair			2
in 2013 , the average wage in @entity11 was £ 49,600 , annually			0
an emerging @entity24 player at a major club could expect to earn that in between two weeks and a month at the worst			1
so how will the @entity5 calculate what is financially fair for the interlopers , particularly as b teams are notoriously under - supported ? top table : commission members @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity15 with @entity16 press officer @entity71 booked : @entity15 poses with his 82 - page report on the @entity74 pitch some optimistic souls think the bright young things of @entity77 would give a revenue boost to the lower divisions but the opposite is true			1
these teams have no away support , for instance , so that vital revenue stream for @entity5 clubs might be reduced to a dribble			1
in @entity89 , where the b team idea is long established , @entity87 — about to be relegated , by the way — are the 19th worst supported team in the second division , with @entity93 16th			1
@entity87 are averaging crowds of 72,943 in this campaign ; @entity87 are averaging 3,049			1
last season , a single @entity87 home game amounted to close to 15,000 more than watched @entity98 all year			1
it is the same with @entity93 in 2012 - 13 , their average attendance was 5,117 — but one game against @entity103 , who clinched promotion that day , was besieged by 10,000 away fans and drew 13,826 , amounting to close to 13 per cent of the season total			2
@entity93 had the lowest gate of the season , 977 against @entity109 ; @entity98 hold that record this year , 1,136 against @entity111			2
one imagines , once any novelty wears off , @entity42 ’s b teams may even draw less			2
you ca n’t pay players £ 20,000 a week on gates of , let ’s be generous , 2,500			0
if @entity120 wanted to do it they would be hit with punitive fines			0
so there is no way of levelling this playing field , unless the @entity5 insists these b teams are set up as separate entities with their own , quantifiable , financial structure that can be measured against their rivals			1
and that ca n’t happen because the salaries are those of aspiring @entity24 footballers			2
on the slide : @entity87 are on the verge of being relegated low crowds : the @entity137 are the 19th worst supported side in the second division that ’s the technical , practical point			1
here ’s one from the heart			0
@entity142 fans sing that @entity143 have no history , and that ’s rubbish — but @entity146 certainly have n’t			0
and neither have @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 or any other bs you care to name			0
meanwhile , in the lower leagues , away from the daily narrative spilled across our back pages and television screens , there are rivalries that go back decades , maybe even centuries , fixtures that are anticipated all year , while barely registering in the wider world			2
pride of @entity162 : @entity163 and @entity164 have a rivalry that no b team can match fierce rivalry : if @entity24 b teams are integrated into the lower leagues it could devalue the rivalries of teams like @entity173 and @entity174 @entity175 and @entity176 , the only teams in @entity178 ; @entity179 and @entity180 , the two from @entity182 ; the @entity184 derby ; the @entity186 derby ; @entity163 versus @entity187 ; @entity188 versus @entity189 ; any meeting involving @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			1
one of the bitterest derbies in @entity42 football is @entity174 versus @entity196			0
their grounds are 10 miles apart and there has always been rivalry , but in 1984 the @entity202 miners went on strike while the @entity205 miners remained at work			0
it has n’t been pretty since			0
so introducing a raft of b teams into these leagues dilutes those passions and that intensity			2
not discounting that every team in those lower leagues bears the name of its community			0
who carries the banner for @entity219 besides the local football club , particularly once it is kicked further down the league by this invasion of @entity24 wannabes ? there is an identity in following @entity226 or @entity227 that @entity228 will never possess			1
they deserve their voice , their place and their status			0
new league : young stars like @entity143 's @entity235 could play in the @entity16 's new proposed league back to the technical			1
what happens when the top of @entity12 becomes a giant bottleneck through which b teams can not pass ? @entity15 says @entity12 will be the limit of aspiration for @entity38 clubs , but they will be able to occupy promotion places , even if they can not take the promotion			1
what happens if the top eight teams in @entity12 can not go up , and promotion and play - offs involve those ranked ninth to 14th ? those clubs will not be equipped for the championship			1
they will not have sufficient form or financial strength based on revenue to cope			0
crowds are drawn to winning football and the ninth placed team in @entity12 this season , @entity258 , lost 21 matches			0
could we seriously consider promotion for a team who had been beaten that many times ? promotion is about momentum			0
what keeps a team afloat in a higher division is often the positive energy that has been built over the previous winning campaign			0
yet what momentum will a mid-table club rising by default have ; how will they cope without that thrust ? reserve teams used to play in the @entity281 and the @entity282 but as the modern game evolved , so major @entity24 clubs became dissatisfied with that model			1
they did n’t like the idea of their precious young talent being kicked around an empty stadium by much older professionals , inferior , on the wane and cynical , or desperate to impress the manager that they were ready for first - team action on saturday			0
this , if anything , is worse			0
playing against some hatchet - faced old pro from the lower leagues , whose methods might be at best agricultural , is hardly the best preparation for a career among the elite			2
loan issues : the current loan system allows bigger clubs to stockpile players and loan them out - as @entity143 do with @entity309 unless it addresses the loan system @entity15 ’s plan is bunk anyway			1
@entity309 is likely to return to @entity143 this summer and replace @entity314 in the first team			0
would he have been able to do that had he spent three years playing the likes of @entity318 ? no. so why would @entity143 use their b team when they could still loan a player to @entity142 , @entity321 , @entity322 or @entity323 , as happened this season ? @entity325 came straight into the first team and performed excellently against @entity142 because he had honed his talent against clubs like @entity328 and @entity329 in the @entity331 league			1
it is n’t the same against @entity333			0
starlet : @entity15 has the support of @entity38 , with young talent like @entity337 without the loan system , the elite could no longer stockpile and their best young players would make careers at smaller clubs , many in the @entity24 , as used to happen			1
now if the b teams become reality , the powerful can keep close to 30 or 40 players on elastic in the top divisions and below , and nothing in @entity15 ’s paper truly addresses that			1
outlawing loans , however , would have meant taking on the rich and powerful and the @entity16 are not so bold			2
so what might be a way forward ? no loan system and a clearly defined under 23 league for top level club academy players , outside the pyramid , with a trophy , a financial incentive , and a proper television contract			2
a star is born : @entity364 became an overnight sensation when he played for @entity366 against @entity367 in front of 55,000 at @entity74 what if two slots each weekend were set aside for live under 23 league matches - 10.45 to 12.30 on saturday and 12 until 2 on sunday - serving as a taster for the @entity24 action later ? people would watch their team ; they might tune in to see a top - of - the - table clash , too , or an individual with a growing reputation			1
in the early days of television , before saturation coverage made every game available , @entity364 became a name overnight for his performance in a match between @entity42 and @entity367 schoolboys			0
there is an appetite for a proper youth competition and the success of the @entity391 proved it			0
@entity392 were n’t getting a slice of that pie , however , so they started their own tournament based entirely around the @entity397 clubs and killed it			0
yes , there are good ideas in @entity15 ’s blueprint - a tougher stance on work permit regulation is long overdue , even if @entity403 was among the 30 per cent of players who required special dispensation this season			2
some will at least credit @entity15 with starting a debate			2
yet the b team league is his big idea and it is hopelessly , catastrophically , flawed			0
if a debate begins with a fanfare and ends five minutes later with a raspberry , it really is n’t much of a conversation at all .			0

@entity16 chairman @entity15 and the commission 's plan for @entity24 b teams is doomed to fail
b teams playing in the same league as smaller clubs would make a *mockery* of financial fair play
both @entity93 and @entity87 's second teams play in front of small crowds
b teams would dilute the rivalries in the lower divisions
