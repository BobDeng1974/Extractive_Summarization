by @entity1 reporter published : 11:25 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 11:52 est , 19 march 2014 the family of a climber who drowned in a sea cave today branded the inquest into her death a ' total sham ' and asked if rescuers could have done more to save her			1
the parents of @entity11 claimed the full truth about the bid to save her from the flooded cave she had been swept into had not been revealed at an inquest into her death			1
they claimed the two hours it took coastguards to carry out the unsuccessful rescue attempt was not properly examined at the hearing			2
the coroner ruled she died of misadventure			2
he told an inquest how he was forced to leave her to drown while he tried to get help rescue : two rnli coastguards , circled , stand just above the cave where @entity11 was trapped tragic : @entity39 , pictured , who drowned in a @entity42 sea cave mr and mrs @entity11 also raised concerns that key witnesses were not called to give evidence , including one who thought the rescue effort took too long			1
but coroner mr sheriff @entity49 commended the actions of the coastguards and recommended an officer who risked his to enter the cave for the @entity54			2
miss @entity11 , a former @entity39 ' poster girl ' , had been coasteering with her brother @entity27 on november 2 last year when they were swept into a cave by 15ft waves			1
mr @entity11 , 31 , tried to summon help on his mobile phone but could n't get a signal and so left his 30 - year - old sister to swim out for help			1
coastguards and lifeboat crews were unable to reach @entity64 due to the severe conditions and spoke to her through a blowhole in the top of the cave			1
coastguard @entity69 finally risked his own life by being lowered down the extremely narrow hole after hearing @entity64 scream ' get me out of here '			0
@entity69 , second right , was the coastguard who went down the blowhole trying to save miss @entity11 by the time he entered the cave at cliffs near @entity84 , @entity31 had drowned , the inquest heard he described the moment he found her body after being lowered down the 15ft hole just wide enough for him by the time he entered the cave , two hours into the rescue , @entity64 , who was known as @entity91 , had drowned			1
her body has never been recovered			0
speaking after the inquest , @entity92 called into question the legitimacy of the hearing and said the family were already pursuing a second inquest			0
mrs @entity11 , an author , psychologist and magistrate , said : ' the family has no confidence that this inquest properly examined the circumstances of @entity105 's death and the rescue operation that took place			1
' we feel this has been a total sham			0
we need to discuss it with our legal representatives and make a decision ( as to whether to appeal for another inquest )			0
' we have lost our wonderful daughter and we would like to have some peace and quiet to actually grieve for her			0
' but equally we owe it to her to actually get to the truth of how her last hours panned out			0
it is imperative that no other family ever suffers what we have gone through			0
@entity123 who drowned in a cave in @entity42 after taking part in the dangerous sport of coasteering ' if it takes a fight in order to make sure people do learn lessons then we must follow that through			1
' miss @entity11 , a maths teacher , had travelled to the @entity42 coast with her brother to go kite - surfing but it was too windy so they decided to go coasteering at @entity139 near @entity84			1
they put on wetsuits , buoyancy aids and helmets before clambering down the cliff onto a ledge and jumped into the sea at 1.30pm			0
as they swam past the cave entrance they were hit by a 15ft sea swell whipped up by 60mph winds and swept into it			2
the inquest heard from a coasteering expert who said he would never have considered entering the sea on that day due to the severe weather conditions			2
recording a verdict of misadventure at the inquest in @entity28 , mr @entity49 said : ' what i ca n't ignore is that @entity31 and @entity27 put themselves in a risky situation in poor weather that was predicted to worsen			1
rescue attempt : her brother , @entity27 , left her trapped in the cave while he called for the @entity170			1
they rushed to the scene , but could not save her in time ' @entity27 confirmed they had not checked tides or anything like that			1
it was predictable that the weather was going to worsen			0
' the information was available but @entity27 and @entity105 decided to enter the sea on that november day anyway to do the activity of coasteering			1
' they were strong swimmers but they were rapidly overcome			0
they were swept into the cave and that is how the whole sad affair started			2
' if @entity27 had not been able to escape , no - one would have known they were there			1
they may have both perished			0
' this particular misadventure went very sadly , and indeed fatally , wrong			0
' mr @entity49 praised the coastguard rescue team and said he would be recommending @entity69 for a bravery award			0
aftermath : in the hours after the horrifying incident , rescuers had to retrieve her body from the tiny inlet			2
today , @entity27 , 31 , told an inquest she screamed for help while she was trapped in the small cave @entity205 : a lifeboat crew tried to reach the 5ft entrance to the cave but was beaten back by the waves			1
one rescuer was lowered down into the cave , but @entity31 was already dead @entity212 , helicopter paramedic winchman , was also in attendance to hear the accounts of what happened he added : ' he acted with considerable bravery			1
he was advised he did not have to go down into the blowhole but the decision was taken that it was the only option available			2
' in a statement @entity221 , president of the @entity222 and who was at the cliffs on the day , raised concerns about the apparent lack of urgency of the rescue			0
but @entity230 , manager of @entity232 coastguard , said his team did all they could to reach @entity64			0
he said : ' this was a complex rescue with winds gusting up to 60mph , horrendous sea conditions combined with high tide and limited access to the cave			2
' this was proven when one of our coastguard rescue officers risked his own life when attempting to abseil down a narrow blowhole			2
' i am confident the coastguard helicopter crew , rescue teams and the @entity251 lifeboat crews on scene that day made every effort while there was still a chance of a successful rescue outcome			0
' miss @entity11 , from @entity257 , @entity258 , was born in @entity259 and her family returned to the @entity261 when she was eight			0
she joined the @entity262 at @entity263 and was part of the @entity39 's recruitment team			1
she graduated in engineering before going on to qualify as a maths teacher and worked at a school in @entity269 .			0

@entity123 's parents claim vital evidence was not examined
the @entity39 ' poster girl ' , 30 , died while coasteering in @entity42
brother had to leave her trapped in cave while he *alerted* @entity170
@entity27 , 31 , said she screamed ' get me out of here ' as water filled the cave
rescuers could only speak to the *terrified* woman through a blowhole
by the time @entity170 had entered the cave , she had already drowned
when @entity27 was told she was dead , he said : ' i should n't have left her '
