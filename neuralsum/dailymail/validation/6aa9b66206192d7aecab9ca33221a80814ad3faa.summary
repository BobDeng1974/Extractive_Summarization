@entity1 defender @entity0 will lead his side into sunday 's @entity4 clash with @entity5 insisting confidence levels have not been hit by a fortnight of frustration which has plunged them deeper into the relegation dogfight			1
missed opportunities against @entity12 and @entity13 have left the @entity14 hovering three points above the drop zone while their hopes have also been hit by the news that striker @entity19 faces six weeks on the sidelines after knee surgery			2
on the face of it a clash with @entity24 's champions elect is the last thing the struggling hosts might wish for but former @entity29 star @entity0 is adamant his team can once again rise to the occasion this weekend			1
@entity0 ( centre ) says his side are not low in confidence and have a great fighting spirit @entity0 said : ' we have got a spirit and a fight about us and we have certainly shown that in recent weeks			1
it 's all about fine margins and at the end of the day we picked up points that might be valuable at the end of the season			0
' it is a massive challenge playing against all the top teams but we have been away to @entity49 and @entity50 and @entity51 and picked points up and we could quite easily have picked up all three against @entity50			0
' the @entity14 ' survival hopes took another hit last week when fellow strugglers @entity54 upset @entity56 's men at @entity57 but @entity0 says that upset can provide inspiration for his own side on sunday			1
the @entity1 captain remonstrates with referee @entity61 following @entity62 's sending off ' you do look at other results , there 's no hiding that , and seeing that kind of result definitely gives us that belief , ' added @entity0			1
' on paper it was n't one you would look at but credit to @entity54 who showed what the @entity4 is about			0
' @entity19 's untimely absence will mean another chance for either record signing @entity79 or @entity80 in attack , but the game is likely to come too early for long - term injured trio @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
however despite @entity19 's grim immediate prognosis , boss @entity86 is determined not to completely write the @entity89 striker off and believes he could yet return to play a part in the potentially crucial end - of - season run - in			2
@entity86 said : ' being realistic we think it 's going to be at least six weeks			0
it could force him out for the rest of the season , but knowing @entity98 the way i do i am sure he is going to give it a good shot			0
' @entity19 faces up to six weeks out and is all but ruled out of their @entity4 survival bid			0

@entity0 has *praised* his team - mates for their fighting spirit
the @entity1 captain thinks this mentality will help them survive relegation
