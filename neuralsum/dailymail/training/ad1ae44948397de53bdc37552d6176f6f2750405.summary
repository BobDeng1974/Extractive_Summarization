up to 15,000 immigrants are sneaking into @entity4 a year through @entity5 , the @entity2 town ’s deputy mayor has claimed			1
@entity6 , who is also the port ’s immigration chief , went public with the estimate because he said @entity5 was becoming a ‘ magnet for illegal immigrants ' , with hundreds of foreigners sleeping rough there before stowing away aboard lorries and ferries			0
‘ according to our estimations , depending on the night , between 10 , 20 , even 40 are getting through , ’ he said			0
the official 's criticism of @entity4 came just days after @entity2 interior minister @entity19 called on the @entity4 to change its immigration policy because of the pressure that @entity5 was under			1
straight - talking : @entity5 deputy mayor @entity6 says the border should be taken to the @entity4 so @entity2 does n't have to deal with it @entity4 immigration officers checking vehicles headed for @entity4 via @entity5 - the port 's mayor says the @entity4 is n't doing enough to halt the tide of illegal immigrants crossing : asylum seekers and migrants from around the world camp next to the @entity5 container port @entity5 ' mayor , @entity6 , accused ' hypocritical ' @entity4 of talking tough on immigration but failing to act mr @entity6 said : ‘ the ease with which illegal immigrants can work on the black market in @entity4 , coupled with the fact that migrants ’ family members can more easily join them , means that @entity4 is a magnet for illegal immigrants			1
’ it is far harder for newcomers to claim benefits or get jobs in @entity2 , where the socialist government regularly deports migrants , and destroys their illegal encampments			0
the @entity51 shares responsibility with the @entity2 for patrolling @entity5 , but mr @entity6 says the main controls should be transferred to the south coast of @entity55 to deal with what is principally ‘ a @entity4 problem ’			1
he told the @entity58 : ‘ the quickest , most radical and easiest solution would be simply to shift the border from @entity5 to @entity61 and @entity62 and then the problem would n’t be handled in @entity2 but @entity4			1
’ mr @entity6 attacked ‘ hypocritical ’ @entity4 for talking tough on immigration , but then allowing hundreds of thousands to stay , and said if this continued , @entity2 would just ‘ let them through ’			2
he said @entity4 needed to do more to halt the tide of migrants heading there through @entity5 , and said @entity4 had a ' hypocritical ' attitude , talking tough but doing little to actively discourage illegal immigrants			1
the deputy mayor also said that hundreds tried to slip through the border every night , with several of them evading border staff successfully , despite officers ' best attempts			1
pressure : the former dockers social club in @entity80 , @entity5 , @entity2 , has been turned into accommodation for migrants slipping through : @entity83 said that despite border officers ' efforts , thousands got through each year stream of immigrants : @entity5 has been a bottleneck for would - be illegal immigrants to the @entity4 for years he said : ‘ the quickest , most radical and easiest solution would be simply to shift the border from @entity5 to @entity61 and @entity62			1
and then the problem would n’t be handled in @entity2 but @entity4			1
’ on friday , interior minister mr @entity19 said he sympathised with @entity5 ’ plight			0
he criticised the ‘ impasse ’ in communication between @entity4 border authorities and their @entity2 counterparts in the @entity100 port , and invited the home secretary , @entity101 , to visit the area to see the pressure on @entity2 border guards			1
the comments came days after @entity2 interior minister @entity19 ( pictured ) called on @entity4 to change its immigration policy because of the pressure the port is under speaking at the port , mr @entity19 said : ‘ we need full and complete cooperation between all parties			2
‘ we will also , no doubt , need to flesh out and renegotiate certain agreements , in order to reinforce @entity2 ’s cooperation with @entity4 and @entity115			2
’ ‘ our @entity4 friends must realise the burden , the weight , which is on @entity2			0
’ the @entity119 said the @entity4 already has staff in @entity2 who are tasked with aiding their @entity2 colleagues in the battle to stop immigrants travelling illegally			2
the @entity125 camp , which was previously used to accommodate immigrants attempting to head to @entity4 , was closed in 2002 after riots			0
under a deal set up concerning the camp ’s operation , @entity4 pays a contribution towards the policing of the migrant problem in @entity5			2
but the closure of @entity125 failed to stop migrants coming to @entity5			1
according to @entity2 news wire service @entity137 up to 500 undocumented migrants currently live in semi-permanent camps in the port town			0
last week the @entity142 public accounts committee blamed staff shortages in the @entity51 for failures in checking lorries for stowaways			0
in turn , the force insists that it is stopping thousands of people every year from illegally entering @entity4 from @entity2			0
@entity5 became the focal point of @entity152 immigration in the early 2000s when thousands of migrants used the @entity155 refugee camp at nearby @entity125 as a staging post on the journey to @entity4			2
it was finally shut down in 2002 by the then interior minister , @entity159 , but there have been rumours that a similar facility is being built			0
this has been firmly denied by @entity5 mayor @entity164 who insists that a health centre is solely being offered to migrants sleeping rough in freezing winter temperatures			0
victory : sustained by the thought of a better life in @entity4 , migrants live in ramshackle camps around the port ms @entity164 has blamed @entity4 's benefits culture for attracting so many migrants to @entity5 , from where they hope to hitch a ride on lorry , bus , car or ferry			1
these migrants live on the outskirts of the town , thousands of them squashed sleeping in ramshackle camps where tents are patched up with bin - liners and people swarm for the hot food provided by volunteers each evening			0
sustained only by the thought of the benefits and freedom they hope to be given in @entity4 , they come from @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 , among many other foreign countries , and fill their water bottles from taps and queue at food vans for hours			0
waiting : asylum seekers and migrants from countries include @entity199 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity209 head to @entity5 the ' plague ' of makeshift camps , as ms @entity164 described it , is ' tarnishing the town 's image ' , and keeps around 300 @entity2 volunteers busy round the clock handing out food , clothing and other essentials needed by the poverty - stricken refugees			1
the charity salam , which staffs the camps , says that the migrants are mostly young men who hope to make it across the @entity100 and claim asylum in @entity4			2
sometimes the camps are destroyed - in 2009 @entity159 ordered the closure of the notorious jungle camp - but the desperate migrants simply set up somewhere else .			0
