by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 17:58 est , 29 january 2014 could n't resist : there 's a new addition to the @entity4 rule @entity6 of parenting			1
never go into a pet shop with your children ( or anyone 's children )			1
actually , i suggest that for the duration of parenthood you should avoid a pet shop with anyone under the age of 25 at all costs			1
do n't even walk past one with your offspring			1
avert your eyes , cross the road			2
because buying a pet , like weighing yourself on the first monday after @entity26 , is something you must do alone			1
how on earth we managed to get through a decade of parenting without stepping over the threshold of an @entity32 , @entity33 or @entity34 is beyond me			1
friends did n't believe us , but we stayed strong			2
until @entity37 - in - the - middle 's tenth birthday last week			2
my daughter 's desperation for something of her own to look after and love was becoming uncomfortable			2
the continual pleading was disarming and non-stop			2
she talked of nothing else			2
it was a relentless campaign unlike any others before it			2
then one night as i tucked her into bed she softly murmured : ' just one fish			2
she looked so sad , her little pale face all miserable as she drifted off			2
and i could n't help but admire her dogged persistence : even in dreamland she remembered her mission ( i 'm sending her cv to @entity61 boss @entity60 pronto )			0
so ' gracie challenges ' were set ; many sticker reward boards were speedily completed			0
her room was show - home tidy , even inside the cupboards and under the bed			1
homework was done early , books read all the way to the end			0
i think she may even have gone as far as eating a @entity74 sprout if i 'd asked			0
she could have one goldfish			0
' one goldfish , ' i repeated loudly in the car park of @entity79 as all four of them bounced towards the sliding doors with the enthusiasm of orphans headed to @entity84			0
an hour later i had a tank with no fish in it and unwanted @entity88 , a hamster the size of an earring , on my lap. remind you of anyone ? @entity88 runs manically on his wheel getting nowhere there are 24 million pets in this country ( double the number of pensioners , apparently ) and we 've got one no one else wanted			1
unwanted @entity88 is what happens when you take all your children into a pet shop , slightly hungover and sleep deprived ( us , not the children )			1
if i 'd been a @entity110 on the birthday fish mission i 'd have been able to resist ' the wall of rejected pets ' , but four sets of teary eyes dissolved my resolve on the ' no rodents ' clause in my parenting contract			1
for the wall of unloved pets is one of the saddest places in childhood			0
it even brought a tear to my eye and that has n't happened since the baby elephant died in front of its mum on @entity133 's @entity132 series			0
there the furry little fellas sit with their @entity136 written up beside their cages , detailing why they are unloveable			0
name game ' hamster ' comes from the 17th - century @entity141 word hamustro			1
in turn , the @entity141 verb hamstern - ' to hoard ' - comes from their behaviour it said @entity88 , the dwarf hamster , had been brought back twice , once because he 'd been bullied in the cage by his siblings ( code for fighting )			1
he 'd been on the wall for a record amount of time - he was thus the least appealing of the lot			0
' @entity156 , that is terrible , ' the kids wailed , no doubt imagining themselves in that position , as all children generally think about is themselves			1
we 'd just been told that we could n't buy a fish until we 'd set up a tank at home and had the water tested after a week ( who knew the world 's most boring pet would need so much care ? )			1
so for a moment it looked as if we could walk away from the pet shop animal - free			1
but then they spotted ' the wall '			0
they said they 'd give up their pocket money for a month to buy hamster accessories and quickly outlined a surprisingly well thought through cage - cleaning rota			1
but i was already smitten with @entity88 , a tiny tearaway with a big personality			0
i liked the way he hurtled around the cage manically			0
it reminded me of something			0
' we 'll take the one no one wants , ' i said to everyone 's surprise and gratitude			0
everyone loves @entity88 , despite his tendency to nip			0
' he 's an attack hamster , ' my seven - year - old son tells me as @entity88 hangs off his little finger with a determined glint in his eye			1
anyway , it 's a good job we got @entity88 because @entity200 , the fish we got a week later , died 24 hours after putting him in the tank			0
@entity203 is editor - in - chief of @entity204 .			0
