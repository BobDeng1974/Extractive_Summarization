a giant supervoid 1.8 billion light - years across may be responsible for a mysterious ‘ @entity1 ’ in the universe			1
the theory was proposed by astronomers seeking to understand what is causing this larger - than - expected cold area			2
if confirmed , the supervoid would be the largest single structure ever found by humanity			2
@entity11 scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( @entity15 ) of the universe , shown bottom right			1
in 2004 astronomers first found the ' @entity1 ' - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere - and may now have an explanation for its formation the research , published in @entity23 , was carried out by the @entity24 at the @entity11 at @entity25			1
the @entity1 was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 when they were examining a map of the radiation left over from the @entity29 - the cosmic microwave background ( @entity15 ) - made using @entity33 's @entity32 telescope			1
in the map , the universe is fairly evenly distributed , apart from in this one area			0
the huge unexpected region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe and about 10,000 less galaxies			2
while other sparse regions have been discovered , nothing on this scale has been found before			0
‘ statistically , we are very confident that the supervoid is there , ’ dr @entity44 , who was involved in the study , told @entity46			0
he said that the supervoid appears to be ‘ roughly spherical ’ , and it may even contain a ‘ significant substructure ’ at its centre ; a void within a void			0
a supervoid is not empty , but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe			1
for this reason it can ‘ sap ’ the energy of light that is passing through it			0
to explain how that works , imagine the void to be a hill			0
as light enters the void and travels towards its middle , it can be said to be climbing the hill , using up energy			0
once it passes the centre , it would begin ‘ descending ’ the hill and regain the energy it expended to get there			0
but as the universe is expanding , by the time the light gets to the centre , its route out has become ‘ shallower ’ - or less dense			1
this means it can not regain as much energy as it lost initially and leaves the void with less energy , therefore a longer wavelength , which corresponds to a colder temperature			0
the different is marginal - typically about 70 nano - @entity92 - but it is enough to stand out when the entire cosmic microwave background radiation ( @entity15 ) of the universe is measured			2
the supervoid is thought to be causing a ' less - dense ' region of the universe ( illustration of empty space shown )			1
at 1.8 billion light - years across it would be the biggest object ever found			1
but some ' exotic physics ' is also needed to explain what 's happening the huge unexpected @entity1 region , shown , contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe , and about 10,000 less galaxies			1
while other sparse regions have been discovered , nothing on this scale has been found before the original theory was that the @entity1 originated from the @entity29 , and was a rare sign of ' exotic physics ' that our current models of the universe could not explain			1
this new theory , however , suggests otherwise			0
previous attempts to find a void at the distance of the @entity1 were unsuccessful , but this latest study suggests it is actually a foreground object , three billion light - years from @entity122			1
according to lead researcher dr @entity124 , the object - if confirmed - would be ‘ the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity			2
’ the team gathered data using @entity11 ’s @entity130 ( @entity132 ) telescope on @entity133 , @entity134 , and @entity136 ’s @entity135 ( @entity138 ) satellite			2
the findings by the researchers were made using @entity136 ’s orbiting @entity138 ( @entity138 ) telescope ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which was launched on 14 december 2009 , and @entity11 ’s @entity144 ( @entity132 ) telescope on @entity133 , @entity134 however , the supervoid can only account for about half of the entire @entity1 , suggesting there might still be some exotic physics at play			1
the researchers note , though , that it is ‘ very unlikely ’ that the supervoid and the @entity1 being in the same location are a coincidence			0
they are continuing to study the void with improved data from @entity132 , and from the @entity158 being conducted with the @entity159 in @entity160 .			0

@entity11 scientists say a supervoid may account for a cosmic anomaly
the object is thought to be causing a ' less - dense ' region of the universe
at 1.8 billion light - years across it would be the biggest object ever found
but some ' exotic physics ' is also needed to explain what 's happening
