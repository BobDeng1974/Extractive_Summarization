but on - going problems with his left leg have stopped him from enjoying life with his wife @entity49 and their four children honey , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
so he made the difficult decision to remove the troublesome limb , which he referred to as ' the wet fish '			0
before having the leg removed , he wrote a message on the limb which read : ' dear leg , thanks for all the misery and admin you have caused over the last three years			1
' he said : ' the leg is crap - it does not do anything and i call it the wet fish			2
it does not do anything but cause me gip and pain and it can not get any worse			0
' i have gone through the stage of being depressed about why it happened and i have got over it			0
' more importantly this is about my children			0
i can not interact with them how i want			0
i want to be running and playing football with them , but at the moment i have problems just walking after them			0

' immediately following the 2011 explosion , while suffering from shock , he tried to check that all his limbs were intact , but could not move his head as the blast had broken his neck			1
he was able to see a pool of blood pouring from his torso , then realised that a life - threatening amount of blood was also streaming from his neck - he had a severed artery			1
his life was saved when a colleague who had escaped the blast rushed to his aid , and forced his knee into his neck to stop the bleeding			2
he survived the blast , but suffered a broken neck , a stroke , a damaged left eye , was deafened in one year and suffers from an enduring brain injury which causes paralysis			1

@entity139 said : ' i lay there checking myself over to make sure i still had my limbs			2
i could n't move my neck because it was broken but i remember seeing a massive pool of blood coming out of me and then felt and heard blood spouting out from my neck like a hose pipe			2
' i did n't feel pain , just red hot - i thought i was on fire			0
' when i felt the hole in my neck i knew it was an arterial bleed , so i thought that was it			0
