his demise has variously been blamed on murder , leprosy , a snake bite or a fall from a chariot			0
now a new theory about the death of @entity8 has been put forward by a @entity10 scientist who believes the young pharaoh ’s ‘ man boobs ’ may hold the key			1
@entity14 , lecturer in general surgery at @entity16 , said historians have missed evidence that the boy king of @entity20 , who died mysteriously 3,000 years ago , may have had a type of epilepsy that lay behind his ‘ feminised physique ’ and could have caused him to die in a fall			1
@entity24 : @entity8 may have died from a genetic disorder which caused him to have a feminine physique he says sculptures and paintings of the pharaoh , and four of his close male relatives , show they had unusually large breasts and wide hips			1
not only that , but all of these kings died relatively young suggesting they may have shared an inherited condition , mr @entity14 says			2
in a fresh review of evidence , he found historical accounts hint at what this was , as two of the five pharaohs are associated with stories of religious visions			1
he believes they had a form of epilepsy in the brain ’s temporal lobe in which seizures can cause vivid hallucinations			1
mystery : @entity8 's tomb was discovered in 1922 , sparking debate over the cause of his young death this would also explain their feminine features , as the temporal lobe is connected to parts of the brain involved in the release of sex hormones			1
since @entity8 ’s tomb was discovered in 1922 , the cause of his death has been the subject of intense debate			2
clue : @entity72 depicts the @entity74 's large breasts mr @entity14 says several statues of @entity8 who died aged 18 or 19 , reveal ‘ prominent ’ gynecomastia , the medical term for man boobs which is rare in depictions from the period			2
his mummified body was too damaged by those who found it to know , but recent x-rays showing broken bones suggest he died in a fall , which could have been brought on by a seizure , he said in the journal @entity90			0
his theory is backed up by the fact that the two pharaohs who came before @entity94 and @entity95 - also appear to have had similar physiques			0
@entity8 's stunning tomb was discovered in 1922 , sparking considerable debate over the cause of his young death			2
examination of @entity8 's mummified body revealed he had a fractured leg which dr @entity14 believes could have been the result of an epileptic seizure			1
@entity94 experienced powerful visions following which he raised the status of a minor deity called the ' sun - disk , ' or @entity109 , into a supreme god			0
this was a major departure from ancient @entity20 beliefs that there were many gods and is thought to have resulted in the earliest recorded monotheistic religion - the idea that there is only one god			0
@entity95 also experienced a religious vision in the middle of a sunny day which was recorded in the @entity123 , an inscription discovered near the @entity125			0
@entity8 's predecessor @entity95 experienced a religious vision in the middle of a sunny day which was recorded in the @entity123 , an inscription discovered near the @entity125 dr @entity14 added : ' people with temporal lobe epilepsy who are exposed to sunlight get the same sort of stimulation to the mind and religious zeal			1
' @entity136 , a medical historian at the @entity137 , points out that the theory is impossible to prove as there is no definitive genetic test for epilepsy			0
he said : ' it ’s a very interesting hypothesis , but it ’s just that — there ’s no definite proof			0

@entity10 surgeon believes @entity8 had a hormonal *imbalance* caused by temporal lobe epilepsy
the condition also causes hallucinations in sunlight , which may explain why the pharaohs believed they had religious visions
