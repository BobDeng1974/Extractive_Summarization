@entity0 insists he can copy @entity1 and cling on to his @entity3 spot even though he has been left out in the cold by his club			1
the @entity6 midfielder has played just three times for the @entity6 this season and only once - in a @entity10 defeat to @entity11 - since new boss @entity8 took over at @entity12 last month			1
but @entity13 has kept faith with the 24 - year - old , naming him in the starting line - up for last month 's opening @entity17 qualifier with @entity19 and then recalling him to his squad for the upcoming double - header with @entity22 and @entity23			0
the midfielder @entity0 wants to keep his place in the @entity3 squad despite struggling at club level @entity0 ( here fending off @entity29 ) is nowhere near nailing down a spot in @entity6 's side @entity1 managed to hold down his international spot recently - despite not playing for @entity33 @entity0 , though , is not worried that his lack of game time will eventually cost him and pointed to former @entity33 team - mate @entity1 as a shining example			1
the former @entity38 full - back did not play a single game for his club last year as @entity33 boss @entity41 snubbed him completely , yet still made eight appearances for @entity3			1
@entity0 - speaking at the @entity45 ' @entity44 base ahead of saturday 's @entity47 clash with the @entity22 - said : ' you 've got to look at guys like @entity1 ; in the past he was n't playing for his club and was coming away and playing really well [ for @entity3 ]			1
' the only thing i can do , when i come here , is do my all in training to get into the team			0
' i keep myself fit			0
it 's a shame i 'm not playing but hopefully playing well here will impress the gaffer and i 'll get the chance			2
' i think [ @entity8 ] had just got the job the week i was coming away for the game against @entity19			2
' you obviously think if you 're playing against @entity19 and doing well then you 'll have a chance when you go back			0
' but @entity6 were doing well at the time and it 's just a case of waiting for your chance and taking it when you get in there			1
' after @entity22 visit @entity70 , the @entity69 will then turn their attentions to taking on @entity23 in @entity72 on tuesday			0
@entity13 's men will be desperate to kick - start their @entity75 campaign with two wins having suffered defeat to world champions @entity19 in last month 's opener but @entity0 is not looking any further than the weekend clash with @entity82 's side			1
@entity1 his enjoying a renaissance at right back for @entity33 and is set to play for @entity3 this weekend he said : ' we are just looking forward to the game on saturday			1
we will not get carried away with the games coming after saturday			0
' we will only focus on @entity22 and hopefully we can get the win there			0
' with @entity89 still to be put back together after hosting the @entity91 athletics sessions this summer , saturday 's match will be staged at @entity47			0
the @entity45 last called the @entity38 ' stadium home in november 1996 when they beat @entity93 1 - 0 with a @entity95 goal			0
and @entity0 would take a similar result this time , saying : ' i 've never played at @entity47 myself so it will be something different for me and a lot of the lads			2
but no matter where you play , the @entity3 fans are always the same and provide a great atmosphere			2
