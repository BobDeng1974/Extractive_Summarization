by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 20:28 est , 29 october 2012 an artist has created beautiful and disturbing images of houses and other structures taken out of their usual environments and suspended in the sky			1
@entity9 , by @entity8 artist @entity7 , is series of photographs depicting what it would actually be like if these homes decided to up and drift away , similar to @entity16 's movie @entity15			1
as a photographer , @entity7 has created work for the likes of @entity20 and @entity21 and employs traditional photography and digital manipulation			2
towering inferno : as well as evoking a sense of wonder , some of the images disturb , such as this picture of a house engulfed in flame happy campers : it 's not just houses that the artist depicts			0
this work shows a caravan soaring among the clouds untethered : @entity7 combines traditional photography and digital manipulation to create his images stairway to nowhere : residents are stranded as the stairway lies tantalisingly close below ( left ) while graffiti adorns this otherwise drab apartment building ( right ) he said that he tapped into a place of childlike wonderment and drew inspiration from films like @entity51 and @entity52			2
the surreal images show new angles of these buildings and provides an insight into them that is hidden when rooted to the ground			0
' @entity9 ' is on exhibition at @entity60 in @entity61 from october 25 through december 4			0
@entity62 will also show work at this year 's @entity64 from december 4 - 9			0
the ordinary made extraordinary : the artist took inspiration from films that produce a childlike sense of wonder urban : from high rises to caravans , @entity7 releases the structures from their typical surroundings @entity76 : even tents are plucked out of the ground and sent soaring dangling : on closer inspection , many of the images have little quirks , like the crow on the roof ( left ) or dangling legs ( right ) in these scenes industry : this factory looks alien in the heavens , despite practical installations such as electrical and phone cables for sale : it 's difficult to imagine a prospective homeowners making an offer on this ethereal home			1
