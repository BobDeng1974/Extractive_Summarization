he has managed to deceive everybody			0
' i had asked him about @entity16 and he had given the impression it was all over			0
he was so happy when he married @entity11			2
' @entity7 married wife @entity16 in @entity38 in 2007 before the couple honeymooned in @entity40 but after several years of marriage , @entity7 met @entity11 , who he then married at the same resort he had visited with his previous wife six years earlier @entity7 has now been jailed for 18 weeks for bigamy - but new wife @entity11 is sticking by her husband			1
mr @entity6 has vowed that he will confront his friend once he is released from prison , after he was given no explanation			2
' i 've got a lot of unanswered questions			0
i 'd imagine there will be some choice words added in there too , ' he said			0
@entity16 knew nothing about their secret marriage in @entity58 , where they honeymooned following their wedding in 2007 , until she saw photographs of her husband on @entity62			1
she received a letter from her mother - in - law saying she was sorry to see they had divorced and that @entity7 had remarried			1
@entity16 has spoken of the extent of @entity7 's lies after he was jailed for bigamy this week she then went on to say that she had been on @entity62 and seen @entity7 's wedding pictures to @entity11 and hoped that his new marriage had n't affected her too much			1
@entity16 then went online and found dozens of pictures of her grinning husband embracing his new bride - on the same beach where they went on honeymoon			1

@entity16 was aware of @entity11 's existence but had been told she was merely the wife of @entity7 's psychiatrist			1
meanwhile @entity11 was blissfully unaware that @entity7 was already married and only found out about his previous marriage when he was arrested			1
they are believed to have got engaged in august 2012 after he proposed on the same beach where he honeymooned with @entity16			2

none of @entity11 's family knew he was already married			2
after the wedding @entity7 returned to the @entity130 and carried on living his double life as if nothing had changed			1

' i got a letter from his mum on 21 august 2014 , ' she said			0
' it said that she was sorry to hear @entity7 and i had gotten divorced and that she hoped i was dealing with it ok			2

@entity6 ( second right ) was his best man at his second wedding to @entity11 she added : ' it was such a huge shock to me , i went on to @entity62 and found the pictures pretty much straight away			1
' i did n't read the whole letter - i tore it up into tiny pieces and threw it away , i had just picked out certain parts of the letter			0
' those parts of the letter are still whirling around in my head , especially the bit about " mrs @entity161 " - she took his name			0
' @entity16 added : ' i called him to confront him but he yet again denied it - i just went into meltdown			2
' he totally denied it and told me not to be so silly			0
but that was it - i have n't spoken to him since			0
' it 's just been like a total nightmare			0
i actually remember saying this is the kind of thing you 'd read about in the newspapers and magazines			0

in december 2013 @entity16 suffered a miscarriage at 7pm one evening but @entity7 left her by 7am the next morning to go and see @entity11			1
the love rat also tricked @entity16 into redecorating @entity11 's second home in @entity202 , @entity203 - asking her to paint the bedroom , and her children 's bedrooms , convincing her it was his boss ' home			1
@entity16 said : ' i 'd always known about @entity11 but the way he 'd speak of her was just " oh she 's loaded , her and her husband have got more money than sense so i do as many jobs as possible at their house to rinse them "			2
' he even took me to @entity11 's second home in @entity202 on two separate occasions , the first time i actually helped him set up for a party he was throwing for her and the second time i helped him redecorate			2
' i painted her bedroom and both of her children 's bedrooms as he told me it was his bosses house and we could stay there if we painted			0
' @entity16 had no idea her husband was seeing another woman and believed their marriage was still going strong @entity16 was so furious she reported his actions to the police and he pleaded guilty to one count of bigamy at @entity237 in @entity38 , @entity102 , on thursday			0
