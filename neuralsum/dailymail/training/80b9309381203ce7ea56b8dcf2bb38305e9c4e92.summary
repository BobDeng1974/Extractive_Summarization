former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 claimed @entity2 should have fought harder to stay at @entity3			1
the 37 - year - old was at a loss to explain @entity2 's poor form for @entity7 but suggested that a player of his quality should have tried harder to remain at the @entity11 giants			1
@entity0 also mentioned that the same old problems were flaring up for @entity2 as , like when he was at @entity3 , the midfielder has struggled to deal with criticism			1
@entity0 said a player of @entity2 's quality should have fought harder to stay at @entity3 speaking on @entity17 , he said : ' what 's happened with him ? i do n't know			1
there must be something behind ( the scenes ) because his head is mostly down , the body language is not improving even with the world champion ( medal ) in the pocket			2
' i do n't really know what 's happened over the last year since he moved from @entity3 to @entity7			1
' a player like him with his ability should have tried to stay longer at @entity3			0
' that is my opinion			0
you could see there was a little bit trouble , a little bit moaning			0
i think he played well but you need time to adapt at a club			0
@entity2 has struggled for form since moving from @entity3 for Â£ 42.5 and has drawn criticism for his performances ' if there is some ups and downs ( at a club ) you need to fight these things			1
' and now it 's a little bit the same situation			0
he got criticised here ( at @entity7 ) , he 's not at his best but i do n't see a reaction			2
' a player like him with his ability should show a reaction but he never was the strongest player in terms of fighting , body language			2
' that 's his weakness - especially in these situations now when he ca n't use his technique and his vision			0
@entity0 claimed @entity7 fans should trust @entity69 's judgement when it comes to @entity2 's position in the team but @entity0 , who himself won 98 caps for @entity74 , insisted @entity2 was a great player and could get over his rough patch			1
moreover , he insisted that when it comes to @entity2 's position , @entity7 fans should trust @entity69			1
he said : ' when you a buy a player like @entity2 you know his strengths and @entity69 knows i think where he is at his best			2
' if he ( wenger ) thinks he can help the team more as a no 10 i think he would put him at @entity87			0
' in his younger ages when he grew up from @entity88 and @entity89 he was mostly in the ( centre of ) midfield so he felt very comfortable there but in terms of pace he 's good on the side as well			0
' but , he needs to learn how to defend as well because on these winger positions you need to defend			0
' at this level , if one player 's out you have no chance			0
' the former @entity1 man insisted @entity2 can play on the wing , but needs to learn how to defend properly			1
