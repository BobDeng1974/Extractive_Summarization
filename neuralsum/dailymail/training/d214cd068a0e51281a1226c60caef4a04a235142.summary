celebrated : @entity0 will be commemorated with a new theme park to be built at the site of the @entity3 - if funding can be secured after almost 200 years , the last thing you would think the @entity8 want is a daily reminder of the devastating military defeats at @entity11 and @entity12			1
but now a theme park is being planned in honour of @entity0 - and will stage daily re-enactments of the victories for @entity17 and @entity18			1
dubbed ' @entity20 ' , the attraction is likely to be built on the site of one of the military leader 's most famous victories			1
if funding is secured for the £ 180million park it is expected to create 3,000 jobs and could ultimately emerge as a rival to @entity30			1

the six - day battle was the nation 's last military victory over the @entity35			0

and in another attraction visitors may be able to ski around the bodies of soldiers and horses frozen on the battlefield			0
@entity0 is the second most famous @entity8 and much - celebrated leader after @entity66 - so it remains to be seen how much room his countrymen give over to @entity18 's victory at the @entity12			1
@entity8 politician @entity71 , who is backing the project , hopes that construction work can get underway in 2014 and the park open its doors in 2017			1

despite being one of @entity8 's most decorated leaders , there is no national museum dedicated to @entity0 and mr @entity71 said he hopes that it will help the military leader retain his place in the @entity8 national consciousness			1
@entity0 , who is a descendant of the military leader 's brother , told @entity107 : ' there is a huge gulf between his celebrity abroad and the few important events about him in this country			2
' mr @entity71 added : ' as well as being an instrument of economic development , this is a question of rediscovering our roots and our history			0
' we are going to combine historical truth with pure entertainment			0
' he added that @entity122 would be ' unbiased ' and eschew the dominant @entity8 view that the military leader was a great man			2

reenactment : the park is expected to recreate the @entity11 on a daily basis			0
here people re-enact the @entity3 on the original battlefield - close to where the new park will be built derided by the @entity140 as nothing more than a tyrant , a theme park will provide a very modern memorial to @entity0			1
