in the case of these striking and delicate images , it would appear beauty and brains really can co-exist			2
each of the @entity7 - style designs depict a range of neuroscientific images , ranging from a hippocampus to the tree - like expansion of neurons , and even a slice of a spinal cord			1
they combine the traditional sumi - e ink painting style with modern images captured by a microscope and on a computer			1
this ' brainbow ' image shows a hippocampus			0
the hippocampus is involved in forming , organising and storing memories			0
it also connects emotions and senses , such as smell and sound , to memories			0
the hippocampus is a horseshoe shaped paired structure , with one hippocampus located in the left brain hemisphere and the other in the right the images were painted by @entity36 who has a @entity37 in neuroscience from the @entity39 , in the @entity40 , also known as ink painting			1
this piece is of the crab 's stomatogastric ganglion , which is a collection of neurons in the crab that controls its chewing and digestion of food the work was created by neuroscientist - turned - artist @entity36			2
he received his ph.d. in @entity53 from the @entity39 in 2011			2
all of the images are painted by hand , but are inspired by microscopic images of complex brain structures			1
sumi - e has been practiced for around a 1,000 years , predominantly in @entity59			1
dr @entity36 ’s interpretation of the art in involves either blowing ink around a canvas , or using a syringe to place it on the frame			1
' i enjoy @entity7 art. i particularly love minimalist scroll and screen painting from the @entity70 in @entity59 [ and ] am also a fan of neuroscience , ' explained dr @entity36			1
all of the images are painted by hand , but are inspired by microscopic images of complex brain structures			1
sumi - e has been practiced for around a thousand years , predominantly in @entity59			1
dr @entity36 ’s interpretation of the art in involves either blowing ink around a canvas , or using a syringe to place it on the frame			1
this image shows cortical columns which are columns of neurons that perform similar tasks in the brain this image looks like a butterfly , but is in fact an artistic representation of a cross-section of the spinal cord			1
the spinal cord is found in the vertebral foramen and consists of eight cervical , 12 thoracic , five lumbar , five sacral and a coccygeal segments			2
a pair of spinal nerves is between each segment of the cord the left - hand image of the cerebellar lobe was painted using @entity106 gold dye and enamel on an aluminised panel			2
the cerebellum is the region of the brain required for movement and motor memory			0
elsewhere in the collection is an image depicting a glia cell ( right )			0
glia cells are a type of ' support ' cell that take nutrients to neurons , and hold them in place			2
a brain has around 10 times the number of glial cells than neurons ' therefore , it was a fine day when two of my passions came together upon the realisation that the elegant forms of neurons - the cells that comprise your brain - can be painted expressively in the @entity7 sumi - e style			1
dr @entity36 has , more recently , began etching images onto metal , too			1
this process , dubbed microetching , carried out with dr @entity36 's colleague @entity143 involves scanning and editing neurons using computer software , which are then etched onto a metal sheet using a process called photolithography			1
this image shows the brain of a fly from the @entity154 genus - a type of small fruit fly the left image is called @entity158 , while the right is called @entity160			0
' neurons may be tiny in scale , but they possess the same beauty seen in traditional forms of [ @entity59 art ] - such as trees , flowers , and animals ' , continued dr @entity36			1
' i admire the @entity59 , @entity170 , and @entity172 masters because of their confidence in simplicity			0
i try to emulate this idea ' this involves printing the images onto a sheet , placed on top of light - sensitive layer above a piece of steel			2
when ink is placed onto the sheet it blocks light hitting the layer beneath			0
ultraviolet light is shone onto the metal and engraves the image in the locations where the photosensitive layer was blocked by the ink			0
gold leaf is then placed on the surface			0
in one image , dr @entity36 has was inspired by the stomatogastric ganglion in a crab			2
this is collection of neurons that controls the chewing and digestion of food in the crustacean			0
this image , which resembles a watery landscape , is called @entity205 , and depicts a rodent hippocampus			0
dr @entity36 uses several mediums in his paintings of the mind , resulting in images that are dreamlike and scientific			1
he explained that the medical imagery he uses as a springboard for many of his works are just blueprints , because he 's ' always trying to walk a line between photorealism and interpretation ' dr @entity36 has , more recently , begun etching images onto metal , @entity222 process , dubbed microetching , carried out with dr @entity36 's colleague @entity143 involves scanning and editing neurons using computer software , which is then etched onto a metal sheet using a process called photolithography			1
this cortical @entity232 microetching was designed to resemble a circuit inside a computer in another , the artist painted a cerebellar lobe in @entity106 gold dye and enamel on an aluminised panel			0

glia cells are a type of ' support ' brain cell that take nutrients to the neurons , as well as holding them in place			2
a brain has around 10 times the number of glial cells than neurons			0
the left - hand image is called @entity274			2
@entity274 is a nerve supply , usually to a specific part of the body			0
it was printed using ink on @entity106 gold			0
the right - hand image shows neurons in the maki - e style of painting , which translates as ' sprinkled picture ' and involves placing @entity59 lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder onto a brush along with dr @entity143 , dr @entity36 recently received a grant from the @entity289 to create a giant microetching of the human brain at as close to full complexity as possible.the full work will be completed and installed at the @entity294 in @entity295 in 2016			1
dr @entity36 's @entity297 scroll is pictured dr @entity36 recently exhibited his reflective microetchings , prints , scrolls , and gold leaf paintings at the @entity53 meeting at the @entity303 in @entity304 , @entity304 along with dr @entity143 , dr @entity36 has received a grant from the @entity289 to create a giant microetching of the human brain at as close to full complexity as possible			1
the full work will be completed and installed at the @entity294 in @entity295 in 2016 .			0

the images were painted by @entity36 who has a @entity37 in neuroscience from the @entity39
they are painted in an @entity7 sumi - e style , known as ink painting , that has been practiced for thousands of years
dr @entity36 's interpretation involves either blowing ink around a canvas , or using a syringe to place it on the frame
all of the images are painted by hand , but are based on microscopic images of the subject
images depict a cross-section of a hippocampus , *cellular* lobes , neurons and *synapses* , and the spinal cord
