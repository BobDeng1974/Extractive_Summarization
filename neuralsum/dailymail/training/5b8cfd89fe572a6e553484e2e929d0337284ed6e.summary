dr @entity1 , 46 , used his position as a gp at a medical practice in @entity13 , near @entity14 , @entity15 , to assault dozens of his female patients			1
@entity1 filmed the attacks on his @entity19 , which has been likened to something out of a 007 film			1
it has a built - in camera on the face - with simple on and off buttons to record - and can be bought on the internet for less than £ 60			2
when detectives arrested @entity1 at the @entity29 they discovered his hi - tech wristwatch and later recovered 361 high - quality video clips from the watch and home computer			1
at @entity34 today , @entity1 was jailed for 12 years after he admitted dozens of charges against him for attacks against 27 women			1
around 3,000 potential victims were contacted by police officers but the exact number is thought to be ' close to 300 ' – aged between 14 and 51			1
passing sentence , @entity41 told @entity1 he had breached the trust patients put in their doctor			1
' when you committed these offences you breached this duty of trust in the most grievous way , ' he said			2
' you are a disgrace to the medical profession			2
' the police investigation began in june last year when a 19 - year - old woman told officers she thought @entity1 filmed her as she showered and said she had been sexually assaulted by him in @entity14			1
one of the watches containing a tiny camera , which can be seen at the bottom of the clock face , which @entity1 , used to film his patients after arresting @entity1 and discovering the watch , detectives found it had a tiny lens in the place of the number six			1
some of the graphic clips are up to 45 minutes long and had at some point been downloaded onto his laptop			1
investigating officers were left staggered that @entity1 managed to get away with his sexual abuse for so long			1
until police were tipped off about his secret filming by a female lodger at his home , nobody complained about him			1
those he targeted overlooked moments of strangeness for fear of upsetting the delicate doctor - patient relationship			2
during the sentencing today , @entity41 told @entity1 that , regarding one of the victims in particular - a teenage girl - he was in a ' high position of trust ' when he covertly filmed her			1
disturbing : the disgraced doctor also had this watch containing a small camera many victims of the doctor thought his behaviour was strange but feared upsetting the delicate doctor - patient relationship			2
one 21 - year - old victim told the @entity92 of her horrific experience			2
she went to see @entity1 in may last year after experiencing vaginal bleeding following sex with her partner			1
she was offered an appointment with @entity1			1
the surgery had no female doctors and , because of the intimate nature of the problem , she decided to take her mother with her			2

he started asking very strange questions			0
my mum and i were looking at each other , a bit taken aback			0

‘ i had expected that , ’ she said , ‘ so i ’d prepared myself			0
he asked if i wanted my mum to leave , and i said yes			0
’ @entity1 disappeared for a couple of minutes , telling @entity108 not to get undressed until he returned			1
she says : ‘ i assumed it was normal procedure before a patient undressed — that maybe he was closing blinds somewhere , or locking a connecting door in case someone came in			0
’ when he came back , locking the door behind him , @entity1 told @entity108 to undress			1
he did not pull the examination bed curtain around her , close the blinds or offer her any privacy			0
‘ he watched me getting undressed , ’ says @entity108			0
‘ he was very quiet			0
i was trying to pull my top down so he would n’t see			0
but i did n’t know what was normal			0
‘ he put some gloves on and asked me to get up onto the bed			0
he said he was going to do a visual examination and that if there was anything he did n’t like the look of , he ’d take a sample			0
’ police found 361 high - quality images of dr @entity1 abusing female patients at @entity29 in @entity13 near @entity14 , @entity15 for the next 20 minutes , @entity1 ‘ examined ’ @entity108 , filming himself all the time			1
‘ it was a long , long time , ’ she says			0
‘ but i just thought he was being thorough			0
’ her mother assumed that they were talking and had not realised how long he had been intimately examining her daughter			0
@entity108 remembers that he was shaking and seemed very nervous			0
at the end of the consultation , @entity1 gave @entity108 the all - clear and told her to get dressed			1
her mother said : ‘ when she came out of the room , i commented on how long it had taken and she said she ’d never felt so degraded in her life			0
i remember saying “ welcome to our world ” , because all women have to endure that kind of thing at some point			0
i feel so stupid now			0
’ ' in serious breach of that trust you engaged in entirely inappropriate sexualised behaviour with her , including plying her with alcohol and showing her a sexually explicit film , ' the judge said			2
' you then sexually abused her			0
fortunately she reported her concerns to a friend and thus supported , she reported matters to the police			2
' once the police had commenced their investigations they discovered your computer and found these videos which showed you had been conducting intimate examinations of a large number of female patients from july 2009 to june 2012 and had covertly videoed them while doing so			1
' you of all people will be aware that the relationship between a doctor and his patient is of fundamental importance in the practice of medicine			0
' in this relationship the doctor is placed in a very high position of trust and the patient is entitled to expect the doctor to discharge that duty with the highest standard			0
' this is particularly so when a female patient consults a male doctor on intimate matters			0
' @entity1 , from @entity14 , committed offences against 27 women - aged from 14 to 51 - between july 2010 and may 2012			1
