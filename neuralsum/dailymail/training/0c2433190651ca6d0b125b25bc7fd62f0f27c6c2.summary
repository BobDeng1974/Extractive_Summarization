by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:03 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:03 est , 21 december 2013 a @entity4 woman with the mental age of a child was forced to marry a @entity8 immigrant and have his baby so that he could gain the right to live in @entity4			0
a secret court heard that the 37 - year - old , who has a reading age of seven , was slapped around the face by her mother to make her smile for her wedding photograph			0
the judge ’s ruling , seen by @entity20 , reveals that fears were raised she was being ‘ manipulated ’ and her parents were being paid £ 20,000 to marry off their daughter to the @entity25 student , who was facing deportation			1
judgment : a @entity4 woman with the mental age of a child was forced to marry a @entity8 immigrant and have his baby so that he could gain the right to live in @entity4 , the court of protection was told but despite concerns , registrars allowed the ceremony to go ahead and the woman ’s husband , 33 , is now using his human right to a family life as a reason to remain in the @entity4 , despite the ‘ grossly cruel ’ ploy			1
the case came to light in the @entity45 – which has the power to make life - or - death decisions on behalf of people deemed to lack mental capacity – and can be revealed today after an anonymised judgment was published			2
the judge in the case , mrs @entity51 , said : ‘ i think there is a very significant possibility that this marriage was entered into , and indeed this child created , for reasons solely to do with immigration status			1
’ she added : ‘ to put an incapacitated person in a position whereby she bears a child which she can not look after is grossly cruel			2
’ the case has lifted the lid on the grim exploitation of people with severe mental health problems who are being ‘ groomed ’ and then forced into marriage for passports , money or free care			1
' grossly cruel ' : the court was told that the @entity4 woman had been married and divorced twice before			0
( picture posed by model ) crime prevention minister @entity78 told @entity20 last night : ‘ to force anyone into marriage without their consent or the capacity to consent is wrong and is a serious abuse of human rights			2
’ the court was told that the @entity4 woman , who had been a @entity86 but later converted to @entity87 , had been married and divorced twice before			0
in 2011 , she entered into a @entity25 marriage with the man from @entity90 , who was facing deportation after his student visa ran out and an appeal was rejected			0
she became pregnant ‘ almost immediately ’ and the following year they were about to have a civil wedding in a register office when social services tried to stop the ceremony			0
the @entity99 was also informed by registrars of suspicions that there was ‘ money changing hands ’ and the husband ’s immigration status was the reason for the wedding			1
registrars also said the woman was ‘ confused about her husband ’s name ’ and spoke in a ‘ simplistic way ’			1
the judge said ‘ an anonymous informant ’ had telephoned the register office to state that the woman ’s father ‘ had received £ 20,000 in consideration of the marriage ’ , but the judge added this was ‘ hearsay ’ and she could not establish if it was true			1
the woman ’s family produced an opinion from a local doctor claiming that she did understand what marriage meant , but the judge said he ‘ may have had some connection with the family ’ and the doctor is now under investigation by a medical watchdog over the report			1
a senior registrar was ‘ concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background and [ the woman ’s ] right to marry and found a family ’ , according to the judge , so the ceremony was allowed to go ahead in february 2012			1
during the event , the woman ’s mother ‘ slapped her on the face to get her to smile for a photograph ’ and the registrar was ‘ worried about her demeanour ’			1
mrs @entity51 said it was ‘ difficult for me to be clear ’ why the wedding was allowed to go ahead			0
she called for registrars to be given better guidance on how to spot the signs of people with learning disabilities being forced into marriage			0
the @entity159 is now considering the request			0
the couple went on to have a baby boy but social workers had to become involved as the mother can not look after him safely , the court heard			0
carers who have lived with them painted a ‘ worrying picture ’ in which the husband is distant from his wife , rarely speaks to her and ‘ walks ahead of her with the baby in his arms ’			2
' in reality another child ' : mrs @entity51 ruled that the woman in the case could not consent to sex , marriage or where she lived the man told the court he now wants to be rehoused in a two - bedroom flat , with social workers visiting for two hours every morning and evening so he can ‘ go to the mosque and also to pray at home ’			1
‘ i was left with a very strong doubt as to what his true commitment and ability was to providing full - time seven - day care to the baby , ’ the judge said			2
mrs @entity51 added the woman was ‘ being used ’ and was ‘ in reality another child ’			2
last year , the woman suffered a broken jaw , supposedly by yawning , but the judge said that this was ‘ most unlikely ’			1
after the judge ’s ruling that the woman could not consent to sex , marriage or where she lived , the husband and the baby are likely to be rehoused separately by the council			1
the couple ’s marriage has not been annulled , nor have divorce proceedings begun , but the judge said that in the husband ’s view ‘ all pretence this is or could be a functioning marriage has now evaporated ’			1
a total of 114 people with disabilities were helped by the government ’s @entity219 last year , but it is feared this is just the tip of the iceberg			0
a new law is to make forced marriage illegal but cases involving people with learning disabilities rarely come to light , because the victims may be unable or unwilling to report the abuse			0
human rights activist @entity230 said : ‘ forced marriage of people with learning disabilities is often hidden			0
we need to be clear about protection – we ca n’t let political correctness and cultural sensitivities get in the way of this			0
’ although the judge ordered that none of those involved can be named to preserve the anonymity of the woman , in other cases the parties have been identified			2
critics said it meant the registrars , who faced criticism for not stopping the wedding , could not be held to account .			0

@entity45 hears bride was ‘ confused about her husband ’s name ’
judge rules woman is not capable of consenting to sex or marriage
‘ all pretence this is a functioning marriage has evaporated , ’ she says
