@entity0 , 42 , who told jurors he vandalised the picture to highlight the ' social justice issue of our time ' , had denied a charge of causing criminal damage of more than £ 5,000 but was found guilty at @entity18 ’s @entity17 last month			1
the father - of - two smuggled a can of purple spray paint into the @entity3 on june 13 last year before writing the word ' help ' on the painting , which is worth £ 160,000			1
recorder of @entity3 judge @entity25 told him : ' this was a deliberate and planned causing of damage to a valuable item of property on public display , carried out as a publicity exercise			1
' during chaotic scenes inside the court , @entity0 ' supporters shouted ' shame on you ' and ' disgusting ' during the judge 's remarks			1
at one point @entity38 threatened to clear the public gallery if the disturbance did not stop			2
the judge said the sentence must acknowledge @entity0 ’ distress and unhappiness , but have regard to the case ’s aggravating features , and to a degree deter others			1
jurors heard how @entity0 shouted ' fathers for justice ' as he scrawled the graffiti on the large oil painting before being tackled to the ground by steward @entity57			1
he told mr @entity57 : ' sorry mate , i ’ve got nothing against the @entity2 , ' before telling a police officer who arrived at the scene that he was ' guilty as charged '			2
photographs of the incident were posted on a @entity65			0
haries decided to represent himself towards the end of his trial and directly addressed jurors , telling them he carried out the act as a protest against the ' social catastrophe ' of fathers not being allowed access to their children			2
he said that , while he had nothing against the @entity2 personally , he targeted her portrait because of her symbolic role as head of the justice system			0
@entity66 , of @entity83 , later said he ' would not hesitate to petition the @entity2 again by peaceful protest on behalf of my children and the millions of children separated from their fathers by the @entity89 '			2
vandalism : the portrait , left , was hanging in @entity3 when it was defaced by @entity0 who scrawled the word help in purple paint , right , in this image posted on the @entity96 page the portrait by artist @entity98 was cordoned off by a rope in the @entity3 ’s @entity100 as part of a wider exhibition to celebrate the @entity103			2
the 11ft by 9ft painting was bought by @entity3 for £ 160,000 after being on display in the artist ’s native @entity107			1
repairing the damage cost £ 9,204 , the court was told , with insurers paying £ 4,000 and an excess of £ 5,000			1
the oil on canvas depicts the @entity2 in the sacrarium of @entity3 , also known as the @entity116 , standing at the centre circle of the @entity119 pavement , on the spot where she was crowned			0
the judge said he was in no position to come to any informed conclusions about why the @entity127 ultimately denied @entity0 access to his children - other than to observe that in the system of family justice , the needs and interests of the children were paramount			1
' i accept that your separation from your daughters for a period of four years caused you real anguish			0
i also accept that you felt that the legal processes by which you tried to have contact with them had failed you			0
' but i do not accept that the means that you chose to adopt to make your protest were in any way justified			0
' this was , in reality , a choice you made , not a sudden ill - considered act under immediate provocation			0
' support : @entity0 was jailed for six months at @entity17 today where he was joined by supporters from the campaign goup @entity5 haries had prepared by buying a can of spray paint and taking it into the @entity3 , the judge said			1
' you caused damage to the painting , disappointment to those who had come to see it , cost to the @entity3 and their insurance in putting it right , and almost certainly some degree of offence to many people who would regard an attack on a portrait of the monarch as unacceptable			2
' i am satisfied that your assertion that you intended to do no more than cause damage which could be easily repaired is simply not true			0
' i have no doubt that you intended to do as much damage as you could , and it was only the intervention of mr @entity57 that limited the damage to the extent that it was possible to repair the painting at a cost less than £ 10,000			2
' the judge said the opportunity to have close access to works of art was greatly valued by many people			0
' those who act as you did put that opportunity at risk			0
it would be a sad day when works of art can only be viewed from a distance or from behind barriers			0
' haries had about 20 supporters in court for the hearing and there were shouts directed towards the judicial bench at the end of ' disgusting ' , ' shame on you ' and ' @entity5 '			2
there was also a shout of ' how about justice ? ' during the judge ’s sentencing remarks and he threatened to have the court cleared before two supporters gave undertakings not to make further interruptions			1
costly : artist @entity98 with his painting : the @entity116 ; portrait of her majesty @entity2 ll - worth £ 160,000 - which was defaced by @entity5 campaigner @entity0 after the hearing the group said in a press release issued to journalists that @entity66 had begun a hunger strike after being sent to prison , in protest at the ' politically motivated ' sentence			1
it read : ' he will continue his hunger strike until his case is reopened and he is reunited with his daughters			1
' in the statement , @entity0 wrote : ' i hereby declare that the judge ’s decision to ignore the @entity236 ’s recommendation of a community service order and replace it with a custodial sentence leaves me with no alternative than to enter an immediate hunger strike			1
' i consider that as the custodial sentence is well outside of the @entity236 recommendations , this can only be a political motivated decision			0
i therefore now regard myself as a political prisoner			1
' my only crime is to fight to see my two daughters whom i love dearly , after being ordered to abandon them by the family courts			0
' my children and i have done nothing to warrant such treatment by the courts and our government			0
' he revealed he had made a final application to the @entity127 to be reunited with his children and added : ' my fast will continue until this application is granted			0
' until this application is granted i will accept nothing but water , no food , sugar , glucose , vitamins , supplements etc. i hereby insist that any medical examinations are conducted by an external and independent doctor			0
