@entity214 's lawyer says he has no doubt his client has provided all the information he has on the incident and believes it boils down to a drunken accident			0
' i do n't know why anybody 's missin ' the theme here			0
' cause there 's one common element ... and it 's too much alcohol ! ' he said			0
