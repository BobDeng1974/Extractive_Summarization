a newly - wed couple face being separated for the arrival of their first child because of new visa rules that have come into force			1
@entity6 , 35 , may have to give birth on her own because her @entity9 husband , @entity8 , 30 , may have to leave the country because they are having troubles getting a spousal visa			1
the couple married in @entity15 in october last year after meeting while she was working in @entity9			1
ms @entity6 , a product designer from @entity16 , south @entity17 , earns well above the the £ 18,600 threshold required by law , rents out two properties and has two jobs			1
facing difficulties : @entity6 is considering becoming an @entity24 citizen to enable her husband to stay here but a bureaucratic loophole means only the rental income is considered valid by the @entity29 and a letter from the @entity31 said there was ' no flexibility ' on the financial criteria			1
they were shocked to hear mr @entity8 could be forced to leave a month before their child is due in july , according to the @entity38			1
' i ’m faced with having my first child on my own because my husband might get kicked out the country , ' mrs @entity39 said			0
' i feel like the government are trying to force me out because i married a foreigner			0
' last july , the @entity29 instituted new rules forcing @entity48 citizens to meet certain financial criteria before they can get a visa for their foreign spouses			1
ms @entity39 was advised by five visa specialists to drop her battle , saying she had no chance of complying with the rules because she is self - employed and does not have significant savings			0
however , she earns money by working as a university lecturer and design consultant , renting out her properties and drawing funds from a pension pot. mr @entity8 is currently unable to work in the @entity48 because he does not have a visa			1
' i ’ve been told citizens of other @entity65 countries do not have to meet any financial requirements at all , ' mrs @entity39 told the @entity38			0
' they do n’t have to pay the £ 800 visa fee like we do , they do n’t even need a job and they can come here freely and marry whoever they want			0
whereas i ’m a successful entrepreneur trying to support @entity48 industry and i ’ve worked really hard in my twenties to get where i am			1
' she is even considering taking up @entity24 citizenship to get around the rules - but although her grandmother is @entity24 , she has only been to the country once			0
another option is for @entity83 to sell off one of her properties to boost her savings , but it would then take another six months for her husband 's visa to be granted , which means he would not be by her side when she gives birth			1
a @entity29 spokesman said : ' @entity93 nationals are able to bring family members to the @entity48			1
however , @entity93 nationals do not have unrestricted access to the @entity48 , they must be exercising their treaty rights by working , studying or being self - sufficient			2
' @entity97 and his wife , @entity98 , were told that she could not stay in the @entity48 because he was not a @entity48 citizen despite the fact he is @entity101 partners of @entity48 citizens who wish to apply to remain in the country on the basis of their relationship must meet an array of criteria set out by the @entity31			2
they must prove that they and their other half are both over 18 , that their relationship is ' genuine and subsisting ' , that any marriage or civil partnership is valid under @entity48 law , and that they intend to live with their partner permanently in the @entity48			2
@entity31 also requires proof that would - be @entity48 citizens have met their partner in person , that the couple in question are not related in any way that would prevent them marrying under @entity48 law , and that any previous relationship has permanently broken down			1
finally the applicant must show that they meet @entity31 's list of ' suitability requirements ' , along with its @entity127 language requirement , and - crucially for @entity128 - its financial requirement			0
this states that any non-national hoping to remain in the country on the grounds that their partner is a @entity48 citizen must have an income of at least £ 18,600			2
if the applicant has a child that is not a citizen or settled in the country that they wish to live with them in the country , the minimum income goes up to £ 22,400			0
each additional child requires an additional income of £ 2,400			0
the @entity31 states on its website that applicants can meet the financial requirement from the employment or self - employment of their sponsor , as well as through their own employment			0
cash savings are also taken into account when applications are being considered , along with any benefits or pension payments the applicant or their sponsor receive in the @entity48			2
last week a @entity101 photographer was told he could not bring his @entity160 wife into the @entity48 because he was not a @entity48 citizen			2
@entity97 was born in @entity162 in @entity163 to @entity48 parents but the @entity31 has denied his new wife @entity165 permission to stay in the country , claiming that he ' does not hold settled status '			0
mr @entity97 , who even has a twin brother whose citizenship has never been disputed , is now facing leaving @entity48 over the blunder			0
officials admitted that the bizarre claim was a ' clerical error ' , but insisted that mr @entity97 ’s new wife would have to leave the country in any case because she does not make enough money to stay			0
new rules governing the applications of the partners of @entity48 citizens came in on july 8 2012			1
would - be @entity48 citizens who applied before that date were required to prove that they and their sponsor had adequate means to support themselves without relying on state handouts , but no specific minimum income level was set .			0

baby is due in july but @entity8 may have to leave @entity48 in june
