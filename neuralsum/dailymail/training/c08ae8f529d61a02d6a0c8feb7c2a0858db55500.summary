by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 are @entity2 right to sack @entity3 @entity3 will be sacked by @entity2 after the owners , the @entity5 family , finally lost patience with the club ’s dismal season			1
@entity2 are confident of landing @entity11 coach @entity10 as his replacement once they have tied up details of their manager ’s severance			0
the @entity18 champions have already made contact with the @entity20 and he wants to join @entity2 after the @entity21			0
the @entity23 board planned to sack @entity3 — just a year into a six - year contract — at the end of the season but will now bring forward that announcement after news of their intentions was reported by @entity31 on monday afternoon			2
end of the line : @entity3 will be sacked by @entity2 and could leave before the end of the season under pressure : @entity2 crashed to a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity3 's former club @entity36 on sunday , their 11th defeat of the @entity18 season searching for inspiration : @entity3 has found it impossible to maintain the high standards set by predecessor sir @entity42 bright beginnings : @entity3 started work at @entity23 on july 1 last summer , having been announced as @entity42 's replacement in may played @entity46 percentage 52.94 @entity3 , on a day off on monday , had still not been contacted by the club on monday night and is understood to be hurt and angry after learning of his fate on newspaper websites			1
he will attend trainingat @entity51 today but may well not survive the week			0
player - coach @entity52 is lined up to replace him until the end of the season , alongside fellow treble winner @entity55 , as @entity2 try to salvage some pride by finishing in the @entity57 places at least			2
sir @entity42 , who appointed @entity3 , is expected to have little or no say in who the next manager will be			0
news of the 50 - year - old ’s imminent departure broke on monday in the wake of sunday ’s defeat at his old club @entity36			1
however , it is understood the club decided to look for alternatives after the 2 - 0 reverse in the @entity72 at @entity73 in february			2
meet the new boss : @entity3 gets to work on his first morning as @entity2 manager at the club 's @entity51 training complex backing : supporters on the @entity79 commissioned a banner proclaiming @entity3 as the ' @entity81 ' good start : @entity3 lifts the @entity83 after @entity2 beat @entity84 2 - 0 at @entity85 back in august			1
it will be his only piece of silverware with the club winning start : @entity2 won 4 - 1 at @entity90 on the opening day of the season , getting their title defence off to the perfect start warm reception : @entity3 is introduced to the @entity23 crowd prior to his first home game against @entity98 april 26 @entity99 ( @entity100 ) may 3 @entity101 ( @entity100 ) may 6 @entity102 ( @entity100 ) may 11 @entity103 ( a ) the @entity5 , who are due in @entity104 next week , had been supportive of @entity105 but have sensed since the turn of the year that results and performances were getting worse and that some of @entity2 ’s senior stars had simply stopped playing for their manager			1
they want to appoint a new manager — preferably @entity112 — as soon as possible so they can tie up deals for players including @entity103 ’s @entity115 before the @entity21			0
@entity2 know that it will be hard enough to attract players this summer without @entity72 football and did n’t want to continue the negotiating process with a manager who had become a lame duck			0
certainly not many @entity2 players will be disappointed to hear the news			0
even those who like @entity3 realised that things were not working , an impression that hardened when the @entity124 walked into the dressing room at @entity126 on sunday afternoon and told his team they had played well			0

at 62 , @entity112 is a relatively old manager , but after the experiment with @entity3 , @entity2 are aware they need a coach with the presence and the experience to cope with a club of their size and profile			2
united old boy @entity167 may survive the backroom cull , as may goalkeeping coach @entity169 after his exceptional work with @entity171 this season			0
@entity173 : @entity3 did persuade star striker @entity174 to turn down the overtures of @entity98 and sign a new contract revenge : @entity2 knocked @entity133 out of the @entity178 at the third round stage , offering swift retribution for the @entity131 loss passion play : @entity3 celebrates @entity184 's goal as @entity2 beat @entity185 3 - 2 at @entity23 low point : @entity3 sits and considers his options as @entity2 lose 1 - 0 to his former club @entity36 on december 4 row : @entity3 grabs the ball from @entity190 as @entity191 looks on during december 's 1 - 0 home loss to @entity193 race is on : @entity3 runs along the touchline to retrieve the ball during @entity2 's @entity198 loss to @entity199 protest : @entity3 runs on to the pitch to appeal after a blatant handball is not given in the @entity199 match no luck : @entity3 rues a missed chance as @entity2 slipped to a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity101 in the first leg of their @entity178 semi-final out : with coach @entity167 after @entity2 were knocked out of the @entity178 on penalties by @entity101 january sales : @entity3 bought @entity211 from @entity98 for £ 37m in a bid to revive the flagging season @entity214 : @entity2 produced their most miserable performance of the season as they were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity73 in the first leg of their last 16 @entity72 tie the great turnaround : but a @entity223 hat - trick gave united a 3 - 0 win at @entity23 and took them through to a last eight encounter with @entity227 anger : a fan remonstrates with @entity3 during the 3 - 0 home defeat by @entity148 guarded : stewards protect the ' chosen one ' banner on the @entity79 at the end of the @entity90 defeat stunt : disgruntled @entity2 fans paid for this plane to fly over the ground during a home match with @entity240			1
the plane 's appearance was roundly booed by @entity2 fans in the ground good display : @entity2 produced their best performance of the season in the 1 - 1 home draw with @entity227 beyond them : but @entity227 came from behind in the second leg in @entity252 to win 3 - 1 and knock @entity2 out of the @entity72 waving goodbye : the final straw was @entity2 's 2 - 0 loss at @entity126 on sunday			1

@entity3 will be sacked and could even leave at the end of this week
@entity5 family lose patience after dismal season at home and *abroad*
final straw came in sunday 's miserable 2 - 0 defeat at old club @entity36
@entity2 are seventh in @entity18 , 13 points off fourth place
@entity52 will be asked to take over if @entity3 is sacked before season 's end
