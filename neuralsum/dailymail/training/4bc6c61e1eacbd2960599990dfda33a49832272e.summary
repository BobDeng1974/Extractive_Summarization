by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 19:28 est , 29 may 2013 the @entity3 economy will perform better than all its major @entity5 rivals this year as the sluggish recovery picks up pace , a leading global watchdog said yesterday			1
the @entity8 forecast growth of 0.8 per cent in the @entity3 in 2013 – slightly weaker than the 0.9 per cent previously expected			1
but it slashed its forecast for the eurozone from a decline of 0.1 per cent to a reverse of 0.6 per cent – with @entity3 doing better than @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			2
recovery : the @entity3 economy will grow by just 0.8 per cent , the @entity8 predicts as it urged investment in infrastructure to secure growth @entity24 , the group ’s chief economist , said : ‘ the @entity3 economy is recovering slowly and that reflects the fact that @entity5 is doing poorly			1
growth is expected to pick up gradually through 2013 and 2014			1
’ the @entity28 - based think tank said chancellor @entity30 ’s austerity plans were ‘ appropriate ’ and ‘ necessary ’ and added that the outlook in the @entity3 was far brighter than on the @entity32 , where the situation is ‘ dire ’			1
but , in its twice - yearly @entity36 report , it said ‘ much more needs to be done ’ to repair @entity3 ’s battered finances and bolster growth			1
the @entity8 called for increased spending on infrastructure projects such as housing and transport to help the @entity3 overcome the ‘ strong headwinds ’ buffeting the economy			0
‘ continuing to shift the composition of public expenditure in favour of infrastructure investment would enhance growth prospects , ’ said the organisation , which cast doubt over the decision to protect large parts of public spending from cuts , such as the @entity50 , education and overseas aid			1
@entity58 , its deputy chief economist , said : ‘ we are perhaps somewhat doubtful [ as ] to the idea of ring - fencing certain spending areas			2
that tends to lead to deeper cuts in other areas which may not be warranted			2
‘ you may or may not want to cut down less on health than on other areas , but that should be a result of an assessment of the costs and benefits of doing it , not because you carve out health and thereby impose bigger adjustments on other expenditure items			2
’ but the report from the @entity8 , which represents around 30 of the world ’s biggest economies , will come as a relief to mr @entity30 as the austerity debate rages on			1
construction : chancellor @entity30 , pictured on a visit to the @entity85 , is urged to invest in house building the @entity87 last week called on the chancellor to loosen the purse strings this year to bolster growth			1
but the @entity8 said further cuts are ‘ necessary to store the sustainability of public finances ’			0
it warned that prolonged weakness in the eurozone ‘ could evolve into stagnation with negative implications for the global economy ’			0
growth forecasts in @entity15 were cut from 0.6 per cent to 0.4 per cent while the @entity8 now expects the @entity16 economy to shrink by 0.3 per cent instead of expand by 0.3 per cent			1
@entity18 and @entity17 are set to fare even worse			0
@entity100 , president of the @entity101 , admitted that governments need to ‘ do more to help themselves get back to growth and move @entity5 beyond the crisis ’			0
he added : ‘ there is no room for complacency			0
’ mr @entity24 said the pace of recovery around the world was ‘ still disappointing ’ but insisted that ‘ the global economy is moving forward ’			0
he called on the @entity113 to combat the recession through measures such as a money - printing programme dubbed quantitative easing or @entity118			2
‘ @entity5 is in a dire situation , ’ he said			0
‘ the eurozone could consider more aggressive options			0
we could call it a eurozone - style @entity118			0
’ the @entity8 said rising unemployment ‘ is the most pressing challenge ’ facing the region .			0
