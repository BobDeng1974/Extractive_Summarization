@entity0 has warned @entity2 ’s misfiring strikers that they can write off their title hopes if they continue to be as wasteful as they were against @entity4			1
a point ensured @entity2 extended their excellent unbeaten run to nine games and keeps them within sight of @entity9 , but missed opportunities are grating on the @entity11			2
he was unhappy after @entity2 could only draw at @entity13 before @entity14 and had pointed words for his squad after they left the pitch on sunday			1
‘ i said in the dressing room that when you can not win such type of matches when you are the better team — like against @entity13 and also now — then it is very difficult to be the champions at the end of the season , ’ @entity18 said			0
@entity28 makes himself big to deny @entity29 as @entity2 spurned several great chances @entity31 sees his free kick deflected off the @entity4 wall and onto @entity28 ' post ‘ when you play your best first half of the season , as we did , and you are playing at @entity38 against a top - six club and you play like that and create six to eight open chances , then you have to finish them			1
’ @entity2 faded badly in the second half , with @entity44 blowing a glorious late chance to snatch a win for @entity4			1
@entity18 blamed the festive schedule for his side ’s slump , hitting out at the @entity51 tradition that saw @entity2 , like the rest of the division , playing on sunday having also turned out on @entity54			1
neither @entity55 or @entity56 were able to turn the ball over the line as it came back off the post a frustrated @entity18 makes an angry point to fourth official @entity62 during the clash in @entity64 @entity65 scored twice on @entity54 but failed to find the back of the net against @entity4 on sunday he said : ‘ it is scientifically proven that the body can not recover in 48 hours			1
you see what it is like — the second half is much different to the first			0
’ however , @entity4 manager @entity74 insisted : ‘ the condition was the same for both teams			2
( they ) had the same hours as us to recover			0
’ he also felt his side could have had a penalty in the second half when @entity2 ’s @entity65 grappled with striker @entity81			2
‘ maybe it was a penalty because i saw it on the tv			0
but from my vision during the game it was difficult to define , ’ he said			0
@entity65 , continuing in his new midfield role , challenges in the air with @entity89 @entity55 had several excellent chances in the first half , but could not find a way past @entity28			0

@entity2 and @entity4 drew 0 - 0 in their @entity51 clash
@entity0 was unhappy with his *forwards* ' finishing
he said winning the *league* was *impossible* unless they improved
