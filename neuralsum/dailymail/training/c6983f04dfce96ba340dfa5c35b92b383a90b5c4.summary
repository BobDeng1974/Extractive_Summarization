by @entity1 reporter published : 10:03 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 10:54 est , 22 may 2013 the @entity3 homes on either side of the @entity6 area house where a sinkhole opened under a man 's bedroom are being demolished			1
officials say the demolition will take place today in @entity13 , @entity3			1
the homes were condemned on april 1 , a month after the sinkhole opened under the house next door , killing 37 - year - old @entity18			1
engineering consultants determined that repairing the homes would cost more than 50 per cent of their value , the @entity19 reported			1
to be demolished : demolition began this morning on two more homes ( one pictured ) in the @entity13 neighborhood where a sinkhole swallowed a man alive in february frightening : a bird 's eye view shot shows the sinkhole which swallowed @entity31 from his bed in february on wednesday morning , heavy equipment and trucks will return to the neighborhood to demolish the homes			1
in february @entity31 , 37 , was sucked into the sinkhole while he slept in his family home in @entity13 and when his brother , @entity40 , jumped in the hole to try to save him , he was nowhere to be seen			1
footage taken by a contractor who examined the hole shortly before the home was demolished showed that every piece of furniture had vanished			1
most bizarre is how the ground had completely given way - revealing the brown dirt beneath - yet hats , high - visibility jackets and shelves remain on the wall above where @entity18 's bed once was			1
a day after the accident , authorities stopped their search for @entity18 as tests showed no sign of life in the hole			1
the house was torn down and the family hopes to set up a memorial at the site			2
@entity67 left their properties and the county has said that the houses on each side of the sinkhole house were condemned			1
' the results of the geophysical tests concluded that the subsurface soils were unstable as subsidence activity is evidenced at each site , ' county administrator @entity74 said			2
bizarre : hats are still hanging on a doorknob in the bedroom in @entity13 , @entity3 yet the ground beneath the wall has completely vanished			2
the freak accident claimed the life of 37 - year - old @entity31 , right gone : this video still shows the hanging hats , left , above the massive hole in the ground			1
the video was taken by a contractor shortly before the home was demolished @entity18 , 37 , was in his bedroom in @entity13 - a suburb of 8,000 people 15 miles east of downtown @entity6 - when the earth opened up on the night of february 28			1
five others in the house escaped unharmed			2
@entity100 , 36 , recalled how he desperately tried to pull his brother , @entity101 , from the rubble as he heard his screams for help			2
' i ran in there and heard somebody screaming , my brother screaming , and i ran in there , ' he told my @entity110			2
' and all i see is this big hole			1
all i see is the top of his bed			2
i did n't see anything else , so i jumped in the hole and tried getting him out			1
hidden : the hole was largely hidden beneath the home but was seen as the property was demolished crushed : demolition experts watched as the @entity18 's home was destroyed three days after his death ' the floor was still giving in and the dirt was still going down , but i did n't care			1
i wanted to save my brother			2
i could hear him screaming for me , hollering for me			2
i could n't do nothing			2
' @entity40 had tried to save his brother when he heard him screaming , but was unable to reach him			0
a deputy pulled @entity40 out of the sinkhole , and likely saved his life			0
following the tragedy , @entity100 said he believed the rescue teams should not have given up so soon			0
' i feel like they could have tried harder to get my brother out of there , ' he said			0
' that was my brother			0
no one is even talking about what my mom and dad are going through			0
they do n't want to be on camera			0
my mom and dad are going through hell right now			0
' break down : @entity100 , right , told reporters that not enough was done to get his brother @entity101 out of a sinkhole during an emotional interview as the family house was demolished remembered : @entity100 set up a makeshift memorial for his brother before demolition began the 20 - foot - wide opening of the sinkhole was almost covered by the house , and rescuers said there were no signs of life after the hole opened			1
experts say thousands of sinkholes erupt yearly in @entity3 because of the state 's unique geography , though most are small and deaths rarely occur			0
' there 's hardly a place in @entity3 that 's immune to sinkholes , ' said @entity169 , who owns a geology consulting company			1
' there 's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole is going to occur			0
' watch out : @entity3 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , and @entity180 are the states most affected by sinkholes , according to the @entity183 a sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground			1
they mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man - made activities			0
when this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer , spaces and caverns develop underground			0
@entity197 , carbonate rock , and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion			0
meanwhile , the top layer of @entity200 usually stays intact			0
when the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large , the surface suddenly gives way			0
according to the @entity183 , @entity3 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , and @entity180 are the states most affected by sinkholes			0
while they often occur from natural causes , sinkholes can be man - made and caused by human activity			0
groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits			0
they can also occur when water drainage systems are changed			0

@entity31 , 37 , was sucked into the hole under his home in february
demolition of homes on either side will take place today
repairing the homes would have cost more than 50 *%* of their value
