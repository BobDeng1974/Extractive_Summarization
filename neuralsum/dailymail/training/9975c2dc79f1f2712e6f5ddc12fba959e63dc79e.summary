we 've seen in the past week with @entity1 and @entity2 that the big fights can be made in this sport			2
that gives me hope that we finally might succeed in getting @entity8 and @entity9 in a ring			1
they are two great fighters at the top of their game – it is a fight the people of @entity16 would love to see			1
i can reveal here that i had a good conversation with @entity8 ’s people just over a week ago and they told me this fight will happen one day			1
my thought is why wait ? let ’s get this done in the summer			2
the date of june 13 would work – let ’s make it			2
@entity27 spoke to @entity8 's people a week ago and is hopeful a fight with @entity9 will happen @entity9 returns to the ring in march after his horrific injury last year i know that @entity8 would love to fight the winner of @entity1 and @entity2 – who would n’t ? that ’s the fight @entity35 would love as well			1
assuming @entity1 - @entity2 is not a draw , there will be only two world champions in the welterweight division – the winner and @entity9			1
the dream for @entity35 would be a unification fight against the winner , but make no mistake , he is desperate to fight @entity8 once he has fought @entity45 on march 28			1
from @entity8 ’s perspective , it makes sense to fight @entity35			1
i ’ve spoken here before about the money involved – he wo n’t get more against anyone else			2
and if he thinks he can beat @entity35 he should take the fight because his chances of fighting @entity1 or @entity2 will be much greater with a world title behind him			2
speaking of @entity55 , like everyone else i can not wait to see it			1
i ’m not sure yet whether i will make the trip – for travelling fans , the tickets will be like gold dust but more expensive			2
i am not part of the promotion and yet i have still had hundreds of calls from people asking for tickets			2
i have heard some interesting rumours on this one			2
some people are saying tickets could trade for as much as £ 100,000 for ringside			1
i have also heard rumours that no tickets will go on general release to the public			0
i desperately hope that is not the case			0
boxing needs to stay accessible even though this is an extraordinary fight with an unmatched ability to make money			1
it will generate hundreds of millions whichever way they sell it			0
@entity1 takes time out to enjoy a night watching the @entity87 basketball team @entity2 training in the ring in @entity90 ahead of his fight with @entity1 the signed contract confirming that @entity1 and @entity2 will fight on may 2 in @entity93 on the fight itself , i think it will be compelling			2
people will say it should have happened years ago but i still think it is a great match - up			1
the general feeling is that @entity1 will win by a wide unanimous decision			0
i ’m not totally convinced by that			0
i think @entity1 will win , but it could be close			0
the one thing that @entity1 wo n’t like is @entity2 ’s speed			0
he will put @entity1 under tremendous pressure and in those circumstances anything can happen			2
it might even lead @entity1 to let go of his punches more frequently and perhaps even force a stoppage			0
i can see that happening , though my instinct tells me he will win on points			0
the star of @entity115 continues to rise			1
@entity116 was incredibly brave and underlined his status as one of the world ’s very best middleweights by taking him to the 11th round			1
but what a talent he was up against			0
the question is where does @entity115 go from here			1
people simply do not want to fight him and he has to pay a lot of money to get anyone in the ring			1
is there much potential for him to stay at middleweight ? i am not sure the names are out there for him to have a mega-fight			0
i do n’t think @entity141 would want it			0
i can see him stepping up to super-middleweight and the three big names there are @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
@entity115 looked impressive in his 11th - round stoppage of @entity116 in @entity150 despite his defeat , @entity116 underlined his status as one of the best middleweights around if he can bring enough money to the table i ’m sure every one of those would be interested			1
i know @entity146 would be			0
but it will need to the television companies to come up with the money			0
they should because this guy is spectacular			0
as for @entity116 , i have nothing but respect for the guy			1
he fought @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 in @entity168 and @entity115 in @entity150			1
he never gets the advantage and yet he always performs			0
i think he has the potential to win a world title but i would like to see him get more backing at home			0
i think he ought to be built up properly in the @entity16 because with some home support he could be a real player in the division			0
i felt for @entity176 at the weekend			1
he put up a great fight against @entity178 but lost against a great champion			2
i am very proud of what @entity176 has done in the last few fights			1
i have delivered two world title shots for him and am confident that even at this stage in his career he can come again			0
he has shown that he belongs at that level			0
special props should go to @entity187 for all his hard work in those two fights			0
@entity178 ( left ) beat @entity176 on points in their rematch in @entity192 @entity176 has to decide what he wants to do next as the @entity194 have ordered he fights @entity195 what happens next for him will be interesting			1
the @entity194 have made @entity195 mandatory for his @entity16 title so he has to decide whether he wants to defend that in the summer or stay in the hunt for a world title shot			1
if he vacates , his younger brother @entity201 will fight @entity195			1
that would be a huge fight for @entity204			2
he is also an important member of @entity206 ’s broadcasting team			0
either way the future looks bright for @entity209 .			0

i have held good talks with @entity8 's people over @entity9 fight
they say fight will happen - we *'d* like it this summer
rumoured ringside seats at @entity55 could cost £ 100,000
@entity116 showed bravery and class against @entity115
@entity176 must decide if he wants to defend against @entity195
