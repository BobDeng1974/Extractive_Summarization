the book , published on thursday , does not make any direct allegations but mr @entity6 says @entity12 's history with fires , which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £ 27 million in today 's terms , warranted further investigation			1

sir @entity217 told @entity218 today that he was not aware of the previous links to fires in 1985			2
he said they were a ' remarkable coincidence ' but that it did not alter his ruling that the tragedy was an ' accident exacerbated by negligence '			2
he added : ' if we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would have demanded further investigation , but i am not sure what they would have revealed			2
' former sports minister @entity237 said today that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster			2
mr @entity237 , mp for @entity241 and deputy leader of @entity243 at the time of the tragedy , says he knew @entity12 ' flew by the seat of his pants ' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge mr @entity15 that the fire was an accident			1

he once described football as ' the opera of the people '			0

@entity12 resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health			1
he died on april 21 1995 after a heart transplant			0
mr @entity237 told @entity279 : ' the inquiry by mr @entity15 concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and i have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case			1
' @entity12 was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants			1
i was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on			0
' but i think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and i do n't think there needs to be another because of this			2
i do not believe there was any sort of cover - up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the @entity313 report came up with the right answers for football			0
mr @entity6 started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster , when she told him it had not been @entity12 's first fire the charred remains of a @entity2 programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed ' there will always be speculation but i just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more , and has scarred the city for many years			1
' author @entity6 writes about his own experience at the @entity331 , and asks why chairman @entity12 was not investigated : ' why was it left to the 12 - year - old who lost three generations and four members of his family , who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10 - yard radius of him , who somehow got out of the stand , as the last person to get out , the only person to get out the front after being at the back , and the only person to survive the smoke ? ' @entity12 's son , @entity347 , 47 , told the @entity348 today : ' when you actually do your homework and see what he did for @entity2 it is a sickening accusation			1
it is just absolutely ridiculous			0
' he never recovered from the fire			0
the stress of it is what killed him eventually			0
it was a shock hearing this today , it was such a long time ago			0
' he 's no longer here to defend himself			0
it 's a real shame it has come to this			0
' he devoted his entire life to that club			0
he saved the club on two separate occasions			0
' i have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club			0
' according to the @entity372 , it would be up to home secretary @entity373 to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely to happen before the election next month .			0
