by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 01:38 est , 17 july 2012 dramatic footage of the moment five chimpanzees broke out of their enclosure and wandered among terrified visitors at a @entity6 zoo has emerged			1
the primates mingled with 2,500 tourists thronging @entity9 in @entity10 last week after escaping from their compound using a ladder they had fashioned together out of tree branches			1
but while the chimps were content to taste life on the other side of the fence , a five - year - old girl and an an elderly man were hurt in the panic as staff hurriedly evacuated the park			1
mr @entity35 , who runs and electronic skateboard company , recorded several unexpected interactions between the chimps and startled tourists			1
he was walking with his girlfriend and her sister 's family towards an area called ' @entity45 ' when they heard some strange noises			2
mr @entity35 said : ' suddenly we heard very loud screaming and noises from apes , like " uh uh , ah ah " through the bushes			1
' nobody saw anything , only the loud screaming from the chimps came through the bushes so it was frightening and everyone on the way stopped walking and was looking around with open mouths			2
' then we heard a women behind the bushes shouting , " oh no ! stop , come back			2
" ' a few seconds later one chimp came around the corner - he was very relaxed and walked up to a man and gave him a hug			2
' the chimp looked like he wanted to kiss him ... but then he opened his mouth revealing his big teeth and we feared he could bite his chin off			2
' stand - off : a family stands still as one of the apes ponders his next move on his way : the family breathes a sigh of relief as the primate walks away much to everyone 's relief the chimp let go of the man and walked off , mr @entity35 said			1
further footage shows a father holding his daughters ' hands as a chimp approaches			1
there then follows a brief stand - off before the chimp simply walks away			2
mr @entity35 said : ' other chimps made their way to the place i was filming			1
i ca n't be sure but i think it was three or four different ones that are seen in the clips i filmed			1
' my friend took the children and fled to the souvenir shop where they locked the doors to gave the visitors a safe place to hide			2
' in the footage , some people can be heard nervously laughing as the apes walked through the park			1
mr @entity35 said : ' it was a mixture between being stunned and scared and excited			1
nobody knew if it was dangerous or not so everyone tried to not attract the attention of the chimps			0
' the chimps were unpredictable and they showed unmistakably that they were the bosses and this was now their district			0
' watch your back : an escaped chimpanzee strolls among many young guests the chimps scaled the walls of their enclosure ( left ) using a makeshift ladder			0
visitor @entity35 recorded the zoo - break on his mobile phone all gone : the chimp 's enclosure , meanwhile , sat empty as feeding time came and went the final part of the video shows authorities escorting panicked visitors from the park			1
' we stayed 15 minutes in the souvenir shop until the keepers guided all visitors out of the zoo , ' mr @entity35 said			1
' as we left the zoo you could here the sirens of the police , fire brigade , ambulances			0
police surrounded the zoo with the advice to shoot the chimps if they passed the zoo fences			0
' some 27 police cars raced to the scene to help steer the animals , which are often aggressive , extremely strong and capable of killing a human in seconds			0
they were joined by zookeepers armed with pepper spray			0
a five - year - old girl hurt herself when she fell over at the sight of them but was not seriously injured			0
an elderly man also needed medical attention when he was locked in the tropical house in 100 degree heat as the chimps roamed outside			0
emergency : guests were hurried to exits for fear one of the escaped chimps might attack a human planning their escape ? the mischievous chimps photographed the week before their adventure over the wall four of the five chimps - seven in total live in the enclosure - tasted freedom and decided they did n’t like it much			1
they wandered back to the enclosure on their own - but leader of the pack @entity190 was enjoying himself on the outside			0
' he took himself off to see the head gorilla , ' said zoo spokesman @entity194			0
' he was a bit harder to coax back			0
he ’s getting on a bit so we gave him a ladder to climb back into the enclosure			0
' an inquiry is now underway to determine what happened			0
the zoo could be faced with a huge bill for the fleet of police , ambulances and fire engines that raced to the scene .			0
