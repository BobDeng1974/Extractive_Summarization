by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 23 september 2013 the victim of a savage dog attack condemned a magistrate who apologised to the pet ’s owner as he reluctantly ordered its destruction			1
@entity7 had to have his face and arm rebuilt as the ferocious mastiff - staffy cross ‘ tore chunks of meat ’ from him			1
surgeons reattached his thumb to his hand and the 56 - year - old builder faces months before he can regain full use of it			1
savaged : @entity19 , 56 , shows the scars on his arm and face inflicted during a terrifying attack by a neighbour 's dog owner @entity26 , 19 , admitted failing to control his guard dog , called @entity28			1
but magistrate @entity29 told him : ' it ’s with a heavy heart that we have to agree to a destruction order			1
i know that he ’s been a good friend to you and i ’m sorry			2
' @entity36 said : ' why are they apologising to him ? it ’s unbelievable - i almost lost my life			1
they need to focus on the real victim and think about what they ’re saying			0
i thought i was doing to die and doctors have told me i ’ll be scarred for life			0
' in 18 months i still wo n’t be able to use my thumb , but @entity26 will have forgotten all about that dog			1
' i ca n’t move my thumb and i ’m exhausted all the time			0
' i used to play piano and was in a band , but i ca n’t do that now			0
' i ’ll have to pay out for any further plastic surgery i need to have			0
' mauled : the crazed mastiff - staffy cross clamped its jaws around the head of @entity7 during the ferocious attack in june surgery : medics had to reattach parts of @entity7 's hand which was so badly injured during the dog attack in @entity61 , @entity62 , in june mr @entity7 was attacked when he went to retrieve a set of his ladders from @entity26 ’s house in @entity61 , @entity62 in june			1
he accused his neighbour of failing to ask permission to borrow them after he locked himself out of his flat			1
@entity28 mistook him for an intruder and knocked him to the ground and clamped its jaws on @entity36 ’s head as he screamed for help			0
pounced : the dog , called @entity28 , similar to the one pictured , left , mistook mr @entity7 for an intruder and launched a savage attack which left him needing extensive surgery , including stitched to his thumb , right the attack was so vicious @entity26 and a friend struggled to pull the dog off before calling an ambulance			1
@entity36 - whose wife @entity85 , 34 , was pregnant at the time - was rushed to @entity86 for emergency surgery			1
he later needed three operations to prevent permanent disfigurement			0
mr @entity7 told @entity90 : ' i try not to think about the events because it was the most traumatic moment of my life			1
all i remember is the animal ripping chunks of meat from my body			0
' i feel very strongly that this dog should be put down so that it ca n’t do this to anyone else			1
' @entity26 admitted allowing his pet to be dangerously out of control in a public place and causing injury			1
mr @entity29 , 69 , imposed a four - week prison sentence , suspended for twelve months and ordered the destruction of the dog			1
wounded : the savage mauling by his neighbour 's dog left @entity7 with terrible injuries on his face , arm and leg which required emergency surgery the magistrate told @entity26 : ' to your credit you did your best to remove the dog , you called the ambulance service and were cooperative with assisting and you ’ve pleaded guilty today			1
' but on the other hand we ’ve looked at the facts and it was unfortunate that the incident took place on someone else ’s land and you were taking someone else ’s property			0
' @entity133 , defending , said : ' at the scene mr @entity26 did as much as he could do to assist in removing the dog			1
' he managed to get as much as he could do in first aid , and then called an ambulance			0
i do n’t think much more could be done			0
' share what you think the comments below have been moderated in advance			0
@entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , 1 day ago " time to introduce a £ 1,000 a year dog - owning licence			1
less dogs = less attacks on humans			0
- maggio , @entity150 , 23/9/2013 16:02 " i 'm not sure why you have so many upvotes because that 's a really stupid idea			1
why punish everyone financially because of the 0.001 % of owners who are n't fit to have an animal			0
the key here is in punishing the owners when their dog has attacked			2
if sentences were harsher then people would think a lot harder about the type of dog they bought and the amount of time they invested in it			2
for example if the law changed and the dog was treated as an extension of yourself , ie anything your dog does , be it @entity175 , murder or whatever , would then give you the same sentence as if you had actually done it yourself			1
this would act as a major deterrent without hitting people financially when most people and families love their dog and their dog loves them			2
@entity184 , @entity185 , 1 day ago the story is a bit unclear but it sounds as if the dog was simply guarding his property			2
mr @entity7 - '' can ¿ t move my thumb and i ¿ m exhausted all the time '			1
well mr @entity7 the dog is dead because he did his job , compared to that , you are doing pretty well if that is all you have to moan about			1
@entity198 , @entity199 , @entity145 , 1 day ago i would assume , although could be wrong , that the judge is sorry because either a ) he is a dog owner , and understands the bond , or b ) he regrets that the dog must be destroyed because his owner failed to control him			1
very very grumpy , @entity204 , 1 day ago so does that mean if i shoot or stab someone it will be ok as long as i stay on the scene and administer first aid ? lets face it , he was caught bang to rights and if he had tried to run he would have been arrested within an hour			2
@entity215 , @entity216 , @entity145 , 1 day ago this idiot broke into someones property			0
i do n't see why the dog should even be put down , he was a security dog he was trespassing			2
@entity222 , @entity223 , 1 day ago i 'd shoot all , but guide , dogs ...			0
. no it 's and but 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity145 , 1 day ago " ' it ¿ s with a heavy heart that we have to agree to a destruction order			1
" i do n't usually agree with the death penalty but in some cases is looks almost justifiable , and the dog is clearly a menace too			2
and while we are at it let 's put the judge out of his misery also			2
@entity242 , @entity243 , 1 day ago i am not allowed a gun or a knife ( as an offensive or defensive weapon ) he same applies for a brick a bat a stick , then none should be allowed to have an offensive dog , a dog that will bite and maliciously			2
time to rid this country of this menace			0
@entity255 , @entity256 , @entity145 , 1 day ago i know what			0
@entity259 , @entity150 , @entity145 , 1 day ago in this instance there was clearly no alternative but to destroy the dog , but the blame for that lies entirely with the owner			2
owners need to be more accountable for their pets			0
it needs to be harder to own a dog			2
breeders need to stop mass producing dogs , which will then help prevent the wrong people buying the dogs			0
i 'm a staffie lover so i know the price they pay for poor ownership , both in reputation and in the loss of life ( 48 bull breed dogs are ( openly ) put to sleep everyday in the @entity145 )			0
to think anyone could think poorly of my old boy breaks my heart , he was the most amazing little soul			0
