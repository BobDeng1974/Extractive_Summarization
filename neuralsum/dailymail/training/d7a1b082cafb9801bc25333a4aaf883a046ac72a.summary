you may think that your @entity2 - coated frying pan is pretty good at repelling water			1
but scientists have now made metals so hydrophobic - literally meaning water fearing - that droplets bounce off them			1
unlike @entity2 , which is a coating applied to metal , researchers used lasers to etch microscopic patterns into metal , giving it the ‘ super ’ property			1
@entity34 and @entity35 , of the university ’s @entity36 , used a precise laser - patterning technique to create an intricate pattern of nanoscale structures in metal			0
to make water roll off a @entity2 - coated material ( as used in the frying pan shown ) , it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle , whereas professor @entity34 ’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off and is said to be super hydrophobic to create the water repellent material , scientists used extremely powerful , ultra-short laser pulses to etch a nanostructure - microscopic patterns - into metal and change its surface			1
a femtosecond laser pulse lasts just of a quadrillionth of a second but at its peak , reaches a power equivalent to the entire power grid of @entity61			0
the etchings are part of the surface so they wo n't rub off , unlike a @entity2 coating , for example			2
the new material is so water repellent that water droplets bounce off it			2
the researchers claim it 's more slippery than @entity2			2
to make water roll off a @entity2 - coated material , it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle , whereas professor @entity34 ’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off			1
they are exploring its self - cleaning properties too			0
the material allows water droplets to collect dust , cleaning the surface and leaving it dry			2
it could be used to prevent rust , stop airplanes icing up and to make efficient and low maintenance solar panels			1
they used extremely powerful , but ultra-short , laser pulses - which despite lasting a quadrillionth of a second , reach a power equivalent to the entire power grid of @entity61 - to change the surface of the metals			1
their work builds on earlier research by the team in which they used a similar laser - patterning technique to turn metals black			2
professor @entity34 explained that the technique creates surfaces that not only repel water , but are also absorb light effectively			0
‘ the structures created by our laser on the metals are intrinsically part of the material surface , ’ he said , so that they wo n’t rub off like a coating			2
it is the patterns that make the metals repel water			1
‘ the material is so strongly water repellent , the water actually gets bounced off , ’ the professor of optics said			2
‘ then it lands on the surface again , gets bounced off again , and then it will just roll off from the surface			0
the etched metals are more slippery than @entity2 , which is a common hydrophobic material that ’s often used to coat non-stick pans			1
to make water roll off a @entity2 - coated material , it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle , whereas professor @entity34 ’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off			1
@entity34 and @entity35 , of the university ’s @entity36 , used a powerful and precise laser - patterning technique to create an intricate pattern of micro and nanoscale structures to give the metals their new water repellent property			1
a droplet bouncing off the material is shown scientists at the @entity25 in @entity26 , believe their invention could be used to prevent rust , stop airplanes icing up and in solar panels			1
here , a jet wing is deiced by a specialist machine unlike @entity2 , it ’s described as being super-hydrophobic and as water rolls off the laser - etched surface of metals , it also collects dust particles , cleaning the surface			1
to test this self - cleaning property , his team took ordinary dust from a vacuum cleaner and dumped it onto a treated surface			0
professor @entity34 hopes that the hydrophobic material could make water collection more efficient in developing countries			1
here , a girl in @entity166 makes a labour - intensive trip to fetch water roughly half of the dust particles were removed with just three drops of water and it only took a dozen drops to leave the surface spotless			0
the surface was also left completely dry , meaning that if it was used to coat pans in the future , washing up could be much easier			0
professor @entity34 is excited about the potential applications of super-hydrophobic materials in developing countries and the research his supported by the @entity182			1
‘ in these regions , collecting rain water is vital and using super-hydrophobic materials could increase the efficiency without the need to use large funnels with high - pitched angles to prevent water from sticking to the surface , ’ he said			0
’ a second application could be creating latrines that are cleaner and healthier to use			0
’ however , before pans and water - collecting equipment can become a reality , a faster method for etching metals has to be created			0
it currently takes an hour to pattern a metal sample measuring one square inch			0
the researchers are also looking into ways of applying the technique to other , non-metal materials			0
professor @entity34 believes that the technique could be used to create multifunctional metals			0
turning metals black makes them efficient at absorbing light , which when combined with water repellent properties , could lead to more efficient and rust - proof solar panels that do n’t need cleaning			1
the team has also used lasers to attract water to materials			0
this proved so effective , that they managed to make a drop of water run ‘ uphill ’ when put into contact with the hydrophilic material			2
the study was published in the @entity223 .			0

scientists at the @entity25 in @entity26 used powerful laser pulses to etch microscopic patterns called nanostructures into metals
they are so super hydrophobic that water bounces off them
material is more slippery than @entity2 so water runs off it easily
could be used to prevent rust , stop airplanes icing up , improve sanitation in developing countries and to make efficient solar panels
