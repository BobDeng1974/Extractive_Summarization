the ministry has faced criticism about deals with contractors @entity1 is to examine every aid contract worth more than £ 1million in a bid to tackle her ministry ’s reputation for waste			1
she said she was determined to improve financial controls ahead of another massive budget increase at the @entity16			1
her intervention will mean a major tightening of the rules – her predecessor @entity20 took personal control only when contracts cost more than £ 40million			2
deals worth less were handled by junior ministers or even officials			0
miss @entity1 is also summoning the department ’s major contractors for talks on cutting costs			1
@entity16 has faced criticism over its reliance on private sector consultants – dubbed poverty barons – who were paid almost £ 500million last year			1
' suppliers must show they ’re not just in it for the money , ’ said a @entity39 source			0
' in the next few weeks @entity1 will get all our top suppliers in for face - to - face meetings to explain that the department will be looking for better value for money in new contracts			1
' if they ca n’t deliver better value , we ’ll use suppliers who do			0
' miss @entity1 is also insisting on personally signing off it and buildings deals worth more than £ 500,000			1
she was appointed international development secretary last month at a time of renewed criticism of the government ’s plans to pour billions more into foreign aid in the coming years			2
a string of peers on all sides used a @entity62 debate yesterday to urge ministers to drop the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid			2
former @entity68 chancellor @entity67 said it was bizarre that the aid budget was ' roaring ahead ' when other spending programmes were being cut back			0
he said it was ' pathetic ' that the government ’s main argument for imposing the target was that all three parties had pledged to at the last election			0
' in my rather long political experience when all three political parties are agreed on a policy it is nearly always mistaken – as it is in this case , ' he added			0
@entity84 said the extra £ 4billion to be spent on aid spending could be spent on a 2p cut in income tax to help the economy another @entity68 ex-minister , @entity89 , said it was wrong to judge a department ' by whether it pushes money out of the door rather than whether it is properly spent '			2
he called for an end to the £ 285million - a - year aid programme to @entity96 , saying it risked creating a ‘ perverse incentive to the @entity96 government to use less of their own resources to relieve poverty ’			2
