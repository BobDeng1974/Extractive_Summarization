deadly : @entity0 , 51 , almost died and lost both her legs and one hand after inhaling the deadly bacteria while in @entity4 in @entity5 when @entity0 arrived at her rented @entity8 farmhouse for a holiday with her husband and friends , it seemed the dream destination			1
but , unbeknown to the holidaymakers , the house harboured a life - threatening bacteria : legionella			1
their planned happy week in @entity5 was to leave @entity0 in intensive care for months – and cause her to lose most of her limbs			1
for while , to many people , legionnaire ’s disease has an almost mythical status , considered little more than scare stories about toxic water in taps , it remains a very real danger			1
although she ca n’t be sure , legionella thrives in water systems and it is most likely @entity0 was infected whilst showering			1
just last week , @entity34 issued an urgent alert after a newborn child was admitted to intensive care with the illness , thought to have been contracted from a contaminated home birthing pool			1
up to 15 per cent of people who contract the pneumonia - type lung infection , caused by breathing in droplets of water contaminated with the aggressive bacteria , will die			1
and those who survive can be left with lifelong disabilities , like @entity0			1
although cases of @entity50 infection have dropped , those contracted abroad have remained steady , accounting for more than half of the 235 instances in 2011 , when the last statistics are available			2
yet most of us , like @entity0 , barely register the risks			1
the 51 - year - old retail manager from @entity58 , @entity59 , arrived in @entity5 in july 2010 as the final destination of a two - week driving holiday around @entity62 with her husband @entity63 , now 66 , a retired warehouse manager , and another couple			1
but @entity0 soon started feeling very unwell			1
‘ i developed a headache and became constantly thirsty			2
i felt lethargic but assumed it was lingering work stress			2
then , towards the end of the holiday , i started being sick			2
we thought it was food poisoning			2
’ back in @entity50 , her condition worsened and she began slurring her words , then fainted in the shower			2
‘ @entity63 rang our doctor			0
when he relayed my symptoms , they told him to call an ambulance , ’ says @entity0			1
when paramedics arrived , @entity0 was struggling to breathe			1
she was taken to @entity81 in @entity82 , where she was so unwell that doctors put her into an induced coma while they carried out checks			0
@entity63 , along with @entity0 ’s mother , brother and two sisters , were told that she was very seriously ill with legionnaire ’s disease			1
‘ i ’d heard of it but had no idea how serious it was , ’ he says			0
‘ we all burst into tears as the doctor told us she could die			0
’ the consultant said the only treatment was an @entity99 ( extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ) machine at @entity101 in @entity102			0
this complex equipment works like an artificial lung , taking blood from the lungs , removing carbon dioxide and then oxygenating it , before returning it to the body			0
@entity0 was moved to @entity102 , but things did n’t improve			1
‘ the doctors tried different types of antibiotics but nothing helped			0
then , in the second week , her hands and feet started dying – they were shrivelling and becoming hard and locked , ’ says @entity63			0
the drug given to keep her alive – noradrenaline , injected into her heart to reduce the size of the blood vessels so it is easier for the heart to pump – can cause blood vessels in hands and feet to shut off			0
life - threatening : legionella bacteria thrives in water systems and it is most likely @entity0 was infected whilst showering in the second week , @entity0 was taken off @entity99 , transferred back to intensive care at @entity81 and slowly brought out of the coma			1
she says : ‘ it was like a weird dream – even seeing my hands and legs in such a bad way			2
i kept telling @entity63 to explain my absence to work			0
’ as @entity0 slowly recovered , doctors said they would need to amputate her left hand , both legs just below the knee , as they had gangrene , and some fingers on her right hand			1
‘ my left hand was so painful and useless that i knew i could n’t keep it , but i was really upset as i did n’t know how i ’d work again			2
i coped because i never dwell on things			0
i had to go forwards and do the best i could			0
’ @entity63 says : ‘ @entity0 cried for about 20 seconds then said , “ @entity147 , i ’m not going to cry any more , let ’s get on with it			1
” she had this strength of character that seemed able to deal with it and not crumble – the rest of us took strength from that			0
‘ removing the legs required a four - hour operation , yet she was still quite chirpy afterwards			2
when i arrived in recovery , she was having a cup of tea and said , “ you do realise you ’re married to someone disabled ? ” i said i ’d always wanted a blue badge for parking			0
’ @entity0 returned home in february 2011 for the first time since her collapse in the shower the summer before			1
she is now able to drive thanks to a special handle on her car ’s steering wheel and has regained her licence from the @entity177			0
she still visits a rehabilitation unit for maintenance on her prosthetic legs and hand but is now medically well , with no lasting problems with her organs			1
‘ you get used to it , ’ she says			0
‘ it gets on my nerves needing someone with me all the time			0
@entity63 has to come on our girls ’ weekends away now but i wanted life back to as normal as possible and that ’s what we used to do every year			0
‘ i still think , “ gosh , this really has happened to me			0
people do n’t realise how serious legionnaire ’s is			2
when i hear about an outbreak now it sends shivers down my spine			0

@entity0 , 51 , was *diagnosed* with legionnaire *'s* disease
it is likely she caught bacteria from the shower in @entity4 , @entity5
@entity0 lost both legs and one hand to the illness
