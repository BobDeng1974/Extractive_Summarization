there is a passage in @entity3 ’s book , ' the special one - @entity2 of @entity4 ' , which goes a long way to understanding the practices of @entity8 ’s manager			1
in the @entity14 version of @entity3 ’s biography , the exchanges between @entity4 and @entity10 in the dressing room at @entity12 start on page 138 and finish five pages later			1
here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 @entity24 semi-final against @entity25 , when @entity10 had made it clear he expected @entity12 to be more adventurous in the @entity27			1
@entity4 makes a point to @entity29 and his @entity32 team - mate @entity30 during a game at @entity34 @entity4 has been called out by players for being too defensive before , by @entity10 at @entity12 @entity29 holds his head in his hands after missing a good chance at @entity39 , where he was replaced at half time @entity29 has n't completed a full 90 minutes for @entity8 since mid-january			1
here is is full recent record : jan 31 @entity43 ( substituted , 89 ) feb 7 @entity44 ( substituted , 73 ) feb 11 @entity45 ( unused ) feb 17 @entity46 ( substitute , 83 ) feb 21 @entity48 ( substituted , 72 ) mar 1 @entity49 ( substitute , 88 ) mar 4 @entity51 ( substituted , 74 ) mar 11 @entity46 ( substituted , 45 ) mar 15 @entity52 ( substituted , 82 ) mar 22 @entity53 ( substitute , 61 ) apr 4 @entity39 ( substituted , 45 ) according to @entity3 , the @entity12 coach told his star player : ‘ i ’m going to say it to your face : you complain that we play defensively			1
but do you know why we play this way ? for you			0
‘ because , as you do n’t want to defend or cover the wings , i have to have the team sitting deep ... when you come on , you do your own thing			0
’ that meeting , held in the presence of the great @entity67 , apparently lasted 40 minutes			0
@entity12 drew the second leg 1 - 1 and @entity25 progressed to the final , where they beat @entity70 3 - 1 at @entity71			0
team meetings are a theme of @entity4 ’s management , giving his players the floor during the fallow periods that inevitably occur during the course of a long season			2
it is a pragmatic approach , one to be admired , unless you happen to be one of the players who challenges @entity4 ’s coaching philosophy			0
you can not blame @entity29 , the current fall - guy , for encouraging @entity8 to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of january			1
when you can call upon @entity29 , @entity93 and @entity30 , why would n’t you ? @entity29 has been put back in his box in recent weeks , failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for @entity8 since the 1 - 0 victory over @entity98 in the @entity101 semi-final second leg on january 27			1
the @entity32 midfielder has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of @entity8 's last 11 games @entity4 demands that the likes of @entity29 work hard on their defensive roles to free @entity93 's flair the @entity32 forward has not completed a @entity109 match since the 5 - 0 victory at @entity111 , where he scored twice for the league leaders , 10 days earlier			1
@entity29 put @entity8 ahead in the opening minute at the @entity113 and his second , when he beat @entity111 keeper @entity115 in the 36th minute from the edge of the area , is the last time he has scored			2
since the 1 - 0 victory over @entity98 in the @entity101 at @entity34 , @entity29 has been substituted or been named substitute in 10 of @entity8 ’s last 11 fixtures			2
here is the record in full			0
@entity43 ( substituted , 89 ) ; @entity44 ( substituted , 73 ) ; @entity46 ( substitute , 83 ) ; @entity48 ( substituted , 72 ) ; @entity49 ( substitute , 88 ) ; @entity51 ( substituted , 74 ) ; @entity46 ( substituted , 45 ) ; @entity52 ( substituted , 82 ) ; @entity53 ( substitute , 61 ) ; @entity39 ( substituted , 45 )			0
against @entity45 , on february 11 , he was not in the squad			0
naturally @entity29 has some concerns , worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers			1
@entity29 was disappointing during last weekend 's win , and @entity4 hit out at his performance afterwards the @entity8 star tries a fancy flick but little of what he tried came off during the win against @entity39 it is believed to have been innocuous , an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the @entity8 dressing room since his move from @entity144 in 2012			1
he is certainly not regarded as a troublemaker			0
it was @entity29 , after all , who is so highly - regarded by the coaching staff at @entity8 that he was considered a potential , future rival to the annual duel between @entity152 and @entity10 for the @entity153			1
when @entity29 returned from the @entity154 , where he scored the 90th minute goal for his country in their 7 - 1 rout by @entity159 in the semi-final , his first - class attitude to the new season was noted by coaching staff			0
despite the disappointment over the summer with the national team , he was eager to please @entity4 as he entered his third season with @entity8			2
in november , his sparkling form was rewarded with a new five - year contract , a move designed to keep him in that role off the main striker , @entity172 , until 2019			0
@entity29 was dejected after @entity174 's @entity154 semi final defeat , but he returned to @entity8 with a good attitude the @entity8 midfielder suggested the side should be more positive with the likes of @entity93 and @entity30 when @entity29 arrived at the club he was thought of as a future @entity153 winner , but his place is now in doubt there is a touch of @entity185 about @entity4 ’s attitude towards him , a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players			1
‘ we talk about it for 20 minutes and then we decide i was right all along , ’ @entity185 once remarked			0
@entity29 is certainly learning all about that as he deals with @entity4 ’s mood swings			2
‘ no , i do n’t think he had a bad performance , i just think his performance was not good enough , which is a huge difference , ’ claimed @entity8 ’s manager after their 2 - 1 victory over @entity39 on saturday			2
naturally there is a little uncertainty about @entity29 ’s performances at the moment , reluctant to try anything out of the ordinary because of the potential consequences			0
@entity29 knows , like everyone else knows , that if you take on @entity4 , he will take you off .			2
