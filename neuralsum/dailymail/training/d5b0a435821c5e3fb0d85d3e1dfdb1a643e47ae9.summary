by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 24 may 2013 most children could look forward to a slice of birthday cake on their third birthdays , but when @entity6 celebrates in july , he 'll have to settle for ice chips			1
the toddler from @entity10 , @entity8 has a rare condition that has left him allergic to all food and reliant on a feeding tube for nourishment			1
after breaking out in severe rashes , he was diagnosed with @entity16 , also known as @entity16 , a rare condition where white blood cells attack food as a foreign object			1
' when i walked into the room when he was sleeping , the room smelled like blood , ' @entity28 said , becoming emotional			2
' every single time i walked into the room it just smelled like blood			2
' as they began introducing other foods into his diet , he would vomit and have trouble swallowing			2
the family was eventually sent to @entity50 in @entity51 where @entity22 was diagnosed with the condition and fitted with a backpack carrying the feeding tube			1
battling through : @entity22 , pictured right with his sister , breaks out into a painful rash when he eats food support : @entity22 , who is from @entity8 , is pictured with his parents and his big sister @entity60 @entity22 has been diagnosed with @entity16 ( eoe ) , an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus , the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach			1
the condition is caused when a type of white blood cell ( eosinophil ) builds up in the esophagus as a reaction to foods or allergens			2
they attack the foods , rather than allowing them to be ingested			2
as they build up , the eosinophils can inflame or injure the tissue , causing swallowing problems			0
it can be treated with modifying the diet to exclude certain foods , by taking steroid medications to reduce the swelling or by mechanically dilating the esophagus			0
@entity16 was only discovered in recent years so little is known about its exact cause			1
but he 's not going through the ordeal alone ; as well as the swarms of doctors , nurses , relatives and neighbors offering their support , he also has ' @entity94 ' , a toy bear who has a matching feeding tube			0
he is now able to eat certain fresh fruits and vegetables , but he still gets rashes that make him scratch all day and leave him with dry skin			0
but for other nutritional needs , he uses the feeding tube , which costs the family $ 2,400 after insurance			0
' it 's a little troubling , but we are making it through , ' his mother told @entity111 , adding that a recent fundraiser at the @entity113 in @entity10 raised $ 2,663			0
the family , which includes @entity22 's big sister @entity60 , said they hoped that the event would raise awareness of the disease			1
' a lot of those people had told me that they know somebody who might have the same disease , or may have had the same disease and outgrew it , ' @entity28 said			0
his condition is caused when a type of white blood cell , called an eosinophil , builds up in the esophagus as a reaction to foods or allergens			0
prepared : he is fed through a tube connected to his backpack - but it costs $ 2,400 a month to maintain they attack the foods , rather than allowing them to be ingested			0
as they build up , the eosinophils can inflame or injure the tissue , causing swallowing problems			0
