by @entity0 while there are many threats to the endangered bilbies , a new technique to measure stress levels by testing their droppings could save them from being extinct , new research has found			1
the study published in the @entity10 found levels of the stress hormone cortisol in captive bilbies breeding programs were relatively low			1
bilbies are nearing extinction through habitat loss , predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events but scientists found the marsupials were ' breeding well ' and had healthy level of stress hormones during the study			1
the popular @entity27 icon at @entity28 is currently listed as endangered in @entity29 , with less than 500 of the animals estimated to remain in the wild			1
the large rabbit like ears @entity33 are nearing extinction from habitat loss , predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events @entity29 's @entity39 professor @entity38 told @entity40 that the results showed captive bilbies had low stress hormone levels			1
' the results tell us that they 're happy in a captive environment , with unlimited food and water			0
they are more relaxed and breeding well - doing what we need them to do so we can get them back into the wild			2
' but signs of some stress can also be a good thing - it tells us that they 're ready for the real world , and help defend themselves , as well as escape from predators in the wild			2
' they 're a little bit higher in semi-wild captive populations and they 're even higher in areas where the bilbies have been re-released in the wild			0
professor @entity38 said the testing process of the droppings is quite simple			2
' the technique can be used for any animals , especially those that are difficult to catch , ' he said			0
' once we get the poo samples , we then need to dry them out , grind them up , then extract the hormones from the powder before we examine them			0
previous researchers had to catch bilbies to test their stress levels , which @entity86 said had obvious drawbacks , according to @entity88			1
' the testing process is much easier than catching the animal , as bilbies would show signs of high stress levels , which is expected when you catch an animal , ' he said			1
bilbies are currently listed as endangered in @entity29 , with fewer than 500 of the animals estimated to remain in the wild @entity100 , from @entity102 's bilby breeding program , told @entity88 it was important that captive bilbies were prepared for life in the bush			1
' we want to make sure that we give them a little bit of stress , because out in the wild they are going to be finding their own food and foraging and doing all the things bilbies have to do out in the wild , ' he said			0
' at the moment we are in breeding mode , so we are building up the captive population because hopefully next year we will be releasing some back into the wild			0
' @entity102 's breeding bilbies will be released in a 29 square kilometre ' non-predator exclusive fence ' specially designed to keep out feral cats in @entity125 of western @entity29			1
' they can breed like rabbits so to speak , so breeding them is n't the issue - the biggest threat to bilbies out in the wild is feral animals , he told @entity88			0
' it 's a crying shame we 've allowed this animal to reach such critical numbers			0
' @entity102 's breeding bilbies will be released in a ' non-predator exclusive fence ' specially designed to keep out feral cats in western @entity29 professor @entity38 said wild bilbies had been pushed into extreme desert conditions			1
' it certainly looks very grim with the condition of the environment at the moment after two years of good rains and cat populations are very high , ' he said			0
the study has successfully validated a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological stress in bilbies and will continue to evaluate the success of predator free enclosures and support the survival of the species			2
' we can use this powerful tool to measure the condition of animals when we release them back into the wild and will continue to monitor their wild populations , ' professor hero said			0
' save the @entity165 and the @entity166 have been a major help to this research and we really want to find more results but we need funds to get there			2
