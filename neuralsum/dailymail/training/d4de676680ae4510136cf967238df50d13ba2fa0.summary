it was billed as ' @entity1 ' - a closing ceremony that owed its theme to the @entity5 tradition of extending a good night out at someone 's house after closing time			1
well , you know you 've had a good night out when you end up getting @entity10 back to your flat			0
she probably would n't get the luxury of singing seven interrupted songs in a row at an after - hours @entity5 tenement party but she was afforded that privilege at @entity18 , @entity20 's most iconic sporting venue , as the city celebrated a memorable 11 - day sporting festival and passed the @entity24 baton over to the 2018 hosts , the @entity26 in @entity10 's native @entity27			1
okay , he might say that to all his party hosts but he will surely find agreement among a sizeable chunk of the thousands of athletes and the people who bought more than 1.2million tickets to the sporting action , as well as millions more television viewers			0
@entity20 sport has never witnessed anything like these games and the bulk of the @entity18 crowd were not just celebrating the successful staging of the @entity24 but a @entity83 performance that shattered all records , provided stories that touched the heart and success that prompted tears of joy among athletes and spectators alike			1
@entity5 2014 organisers had consistently promised an athlete - centred games and the stars of the show were involved right from the start , bursting out of tents to the strains of @entity33 , who even showed signs of rediscovering her @entity5 accent for the occasion			1
thankfully the earlier torrential rain had subsided , or many might have been tempted to remain under cover			0
the sporting stars remained at the heart of the action , but the ceremony continued with a musical thank - you to the thousands of volunteers - the so - called @entity112 - and city workers whose work behind the scenes allowed the @entity24 to be such a success			2
proud moment : rhythmic gymnast @entity118 of @entity119 receives the @entity120 during the closing ceremony for the @entity5 2014 lollipop lady : city workers entered the stadium during the closing ceremony for the @entity30 and were thanked for their work during the eleven - day long event spectators : 40,000 piled into @entity18 for the closing ceremony at @entity18 in @entity5 and were treated to a musical showpiece from the likes of @entity33 and @entity10 what a performance : members of sunday 's cast get ready ahead of the @entity24 closing ceremony in @entity5 's @entity18 break the night with colour : an audience member watches the show as flags are waved during the ceremony @entity140 see out ' outstanding ' @entity24 @entity142 's crowd - pleaser dignity - a song about a council worker who realises his dream of owning a boat - providing a fitting accompaniment as dozens of road workers , lollipop women , firefighters , paramedics and the like walked out under a banner with the age - old slogan ' let @entity154 '			1
the speeches saw @entity61 chairman @entity156 declare the event ' in every aspect the best games ever ' , the resultant cheer dwarfed only by his praise for @entity83 's performance			2
after the @entity24 were declared over and the @entity26 gave its glimpse of what to expect in four years , it was over to @entity10			1
everyone 's favourite former @entity167 star , complete with a headdress that would have seen her struggle to get past the bouncers in most @entity5 nightclubs , began a set that formed the backdrop to what was described as a @entity5 love story			0
it moved through stages such as ' the chase ' and ' the smooch ' , which came after the ultimate romantic gesture seen on @entity183 on a saturday night - men throwing away their bags of chips to form a physical alliance with their respective partners			0
athletes from around the @entity24 nations joined in and looked on , some no doubt more than a touch bemused , as hundreds of performers acted out routines ranging from ceilidh dances to the @entity195 , a type of line dance strongly favoured by drunk aunties at @entity20 weddings			2
about 1,000 people recreated the scene of adolescent innocence from cult 1981 @entity20 comedy @entity204 where two young would - be - lovers lie on their backs and dance to the sky			0
and the party ended just like any other late - night @entity5 gathering - with lashings of nostalgia and emotion - as folk singer @entity214 performed @entity215 , which details an exiled @entity217 's homesick longing for his homeland			0
@entity219 finished off the night as @entity5 bade farewell to some of the best times in its history - already a memory but one that will never be forgotten by anyone who was lucky enough to be involved			0
big hit : 80s pop group @entity142 , who originated in @entity5 , performed their hit ' @entity229 ' at the closing ceremony at @entity18 on sunday night all - rounder : hurdler @entity233 took to the stage with singer @entity235 as the @entity24 were handed over to @entity50 for the 2018 event goodbye : the farewell rounded off in the only way a @entity20 party could - with a mass performance of @entity219 featuring @entity10 , @entity33 ( both pictured ) and the rest of the ceremony 's performers video @entity5 a ' stand - out games ' - @entity60			1

@entity33 and @entity142 help close ceremony as @entity24 are handed over to 2018 hosts @entity26 in @entity27
pop goddess @entity249 also performed at event in @entity5 and sang a number of hits
athletes who took part in games emerge from almost *700* tents *dotted* throughout @entity18 stadium
@entity5 2014 chairman @entity260 of @entity261 praises athletes who ' gave it their all ' and says : ' thank you '
