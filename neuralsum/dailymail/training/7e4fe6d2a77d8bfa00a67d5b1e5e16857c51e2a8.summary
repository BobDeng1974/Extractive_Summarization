twenty years after sir @entity2 invented the bagless vacuum cleaner , his firm has launched a machine that never needs to have its filter cleaned			1
the company has spent six years working on the @entity7 , which it says will work without losing suction for at least ten years			0
@entity2 claims it has improved its famous cyclone technology to reduce the amount of dust that gets stuck in the filter , meaning it no longer needs to be replaced or even cleaned , but still maintains its performance			2
sir @entity2 described the development as the most significant since it removed the bag from the vacuum cleaner in 1993			2
@entity30 is falling behind the rest of the world because it is not training enough engineers , sir @entity2 said yesterday			2
the inventor , right , whose firm now makes all its products in @entity37 and @entity38 , said expertise and technology no longer exists for high - tech production in the @entity30			0
speaking on @entity43 television , he said : ‘ one of the reasons we do this in @entity38 , which is a very expensive country , is because we have all the support for the robots and the automated equipment there which we would n’t have in @entity52			0
‘ unfortunately , we have to have this factory in @entity38 ... the problem is manufacturing has drifted away so fast [ in @entity30 ] we have lost the skills to make things			2
’ sir @entity2 , whose firm still carries out its research and development in @entity60 , @entity61 , said he was trying to address the lack of engineers in the @entity30 by funding programmes at universities including @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity70			0
he added : ' getting rid of bags solved the frustration of my vacuum losing suction			0
‘ washing filters – or worse , buying them – is still a nuisance			0
@entity79 cyclones are so efficient at separating microscopic particles that everything gets thrust into the bin , and you can forget about fussy filters			1
’ the firm said a team of 29 engineers went through 50 versions of the technology , with 2,000 prototypes and at a cost of £ 7.5million , before perfecting the system			1
they found that by shrinking the cone - shaped cyclones inside the cleaner – and having more of them – they could increase the power of the centrifugal force generated , sending more dust straight into the waste container and leaving less to float on to the filters			1
the new @entity104 model has 54 cyclones , compared to 14 larger ones in the best - selling £ 330 @entity107			1
each cone works like a chimney , with the clean air escaping up out of the centre , and the dust and dirt being flung to the outside of the cones and out of the hole at the bottom			1
one problem the engineers faced was that the smaller cones were more likely to clog with dust			1
so they developed a flexible rubber section at the bottom of each cone that oscillates and vibrates with the airflow , ensuring all the particles are pushed through			0
@entity128 , @entity2 ’s director of engineering , said : ‘ we know people do n’t wash their filters			0
with no maintenance , the filter slowly blocks , the machine loses suction and your machine ’s performance drops			0
’ practice makes perfect : sir @entity2 said 29 engineers went through 2,000 prototypes costing £ 7.5 million			1

almost 30 engineers went through 2,000 prototypes to make the @entity104
it *eliminates* the need to clean the cleaner *'s* filter by using smaller cyclones
they use centrifugal force to *spiral* dirt out of each section into the bin
