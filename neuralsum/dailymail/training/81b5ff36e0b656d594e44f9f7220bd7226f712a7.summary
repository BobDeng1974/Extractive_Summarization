a remarkable summer for @entity1 continued with yet more drama on friday night when she was ushered through to the @entity4 final when her opponent was struck by full body cramps			1
the 24 year - old @entity7 was leading @entity8 7 - 6 , 4 - 3 when the @entity10 player started flexing her leg before becoming unable to walk with severe pain in her legs			1
there then followed first an off court medical evaluation , and then a full injury time out , as she was treated for what amounts to a loss of physical condition			1
a complete re-examination of the regulations can wait for another day as it was , ultimately , unfair on @entity1 , but the main focus was on the health of @entity8 , who had to be pushed off in a wheelchair with a doctor in attendance , leaving @entity1 to understandably muted celebrations of a huge achievement in reaching her second @entity4 final , where she will face world no 1 @entity24			1
she said : ' it was really hard to watch for me whenever i saw her collapse on the court			0
tennis is great , but health is more important			0
' to see her struggling out there , i just wanted to make sure she was okay			0
i got the word that she 's okay now and just getting cooled down , so that 's great to hear			0
' i know that she had heart surgery when she was 13 , so that 's definitely something that i think she was worried about , as well			0
' pain : @entity8 crumpled into a heap on court and went into major spasms distress : @entity8 of @entity10 is attended by medical staff after she slumped to the court concern : @entity1 checks on @entity8 after she collapsed on court tournament director @entity78 confirmed @entity8 had recovered well enough to return to the locker room and that the doctor , player and trainer all agreed it would not be physically harmful to her to try to play on			1
@entity1 had her own fitness concerns having been in bed with a cold for the previous two days but said she would ' come out firing ' on sunday			2
the @entity7 was 19 and rocketing to the top of the game when she last reached the final , and it has been a bumpy road to get back			0
' i have goose bumps right now , ' she said			0
' it 's been five years since i 've been in the final here so it 's incredible to be back			0
' and so the three months of her life that have unfolded in a way that @entity1 could never have envisaged may end in extraordinary fashion with her winning the first @entity101 of her career			2
humidity : @entity1 applies an ice pack to her face during a break between games struggle : @entity1 feels the heat during semi-final against @entity8 from the slough of despond she fell into after @entity113 broke off their engagement in may she has risen magnificently , all the way to the opportunity for a massive career breakthrough			1
@entity1 arrived in it via a hard fought progression which , before the medical issues arose , was , in keeping with her life of late , much harder than expected			2
the 24 year - old @entity7 is searching for the first @entity101 as a professional , despite having twice ended a season as the world no 1 through her overall consistency			0
it was five years ago at @entity128 that she made the final , and there appeared absolutely no prospect of that occurring again back in may , when her personal life was sedate but her on court fortunes seriously on the wane			0
as her former fianc√©e prepared to tee off in @entity137 walked out onto the @entity138 in steaming temperatures accompanied by a brisk wind that will have contributed to @entity8 's eventual demise			2
in 37 @entity101 the 28 year - old @entity10 had never reached a semi-final , and prior to this was much better known for her prowess in doubles , which sees her ranked as the world 's no 3 player			1
power : the 24 year - old @entity7 was leading @entity8 7 - 6 4 - 3 when her opponent retired @entity151 : @entity1 has the chance to secure her first @entity101 title yet her surge in form while flying solo had been such that in five matches she had not dropped a set , and had only conceded three service games , even fewer than the likes of @entity24			1
from the start her flatly hit groundstrokes caused the @entity7 problems , while the wind was causing trouble with her serve , leading to five double faults in all during the first set			2
@entity168 needed to come back from a break down before romping through the tiebreak 7 - 1 after @entity8 had served for it at 6 - 5			1
the second set was also hard fought , and even in her brief return from treatment @entity8 managed to force a break point to get back to 4 - 4 before bowing the inevitable , given her rapidly deteriorating physical state			1
the incident will be accompanied by calls for more changes to procedures on the @entity181 , after a similar incident at the @entity183 involving @entity184 against @entity185 .			0

@entity8 collapsed during the second set of @entity4 semi-final
@entity10 player was initially helped off court and received a lengthy medical time - out
@entity1 was leading 7 - 6 , 4 - 3 when @entity8 began to struggle , apparently with severe cramp
