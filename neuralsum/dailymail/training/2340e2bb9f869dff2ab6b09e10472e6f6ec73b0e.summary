@entity0 is set to be recalled on friday for mps to vote on launching air strikes on @entity4 fanatics in northern @entity5			1
@entity6 is today holding talks in @entity8 with his @entity5 counterpart @entity9 , who is expected to make a formal request for help			1
mps are expected to be summoned for an emergency session debate in the @entity14 on friday morning to approve the action , with @entity17 bombers in action by the weekend			1
file picture interviewed on @entity27 , mr @entity6 said the is group posed a direct threat to @entity22			1
' these people want to kill us , ' he said			0
they 've got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition … to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation			0
' the move comes amid growing @entity37 criticism of @entity22 's cautious response to the threat posed by @entity28 , which has murdered three @entity41 hostages and is threatening to kill kidnapped @entity22 taxi driver @entity42			1
mr @entity42 's brother - in - law @entity43 last night appealed for air strikes to be called off , arguing that the raids would reduce the chance of him being released alive			0
but defence secretary @entity47 said @entity22 had to take the fight to the extremists – and suggested bombing raids should be extended to @entity28 strongholds in @entity25			2
the pm will offer the services of the @entity54 during talks with his @entity5 counterpart @entity9 mr @entity47 told the @entity58 magazine : ' we 've had attacks on the streets of @entity62 , on our transport system , at @entity64 , the murder of @entity66 – how much more evidence do you need that this is a very clear and dangerous threat to our way of life and to all the democracies of the @entity41			1
' this is a new @entity73			0
' @entity5 is under attack not just from terrorists inside its own borders but from terrorists in the north of @entity25			2
' if @entity25 continues to be unwilling or unable to deal with @entity28 then at least the question arises as to whether we should n't assist @entity5 in doing so			2
' @entity81 remains nervous about @entity83 's stance on the issue after @entity85 yesterday called for a @entity87 resolution sanctioning military action against @entity28			1
a @entity22 source pointed out there had already been two resolutions condemning @entity28 – with a third expected today on the issue of foreign jihadis			1
but the source said there was no prospect of a resolution on military action because of @entity98 opposition			1
however , today mr @entity85 insisted his party was ' open to the possibility ' of @entity22 forces joining air strikes in @entity5 but would not commit in advance of seeing detailed proposals			1
he said he would ' look very seriously ' at any proposal to meet a request from @entity5 for @entity22 involvement , but action in @entity25 was a ' more complex ' question			1
' @entity24 is a threat that ca n't be turned away from , ' he told @entity111			0
' we 've said that we need an alliance which is not just a military alliance but a political and diplomatic alliance			0
' how will i judge any proposal ? whether @entity22 can have an effect , whether we can succeed and whether it is legitimate and lawful			2
but i am open to the possibility			0

@entity22 was caught flat - footed yesterday when the @entity143 carried out its first air strikes on is positions in @entity25 , in conjunction with five @entity148 countries			2
@entity81 is understood to have been given a ' courtesy call ' by the @entity150 shortly beforehand			0
but the @entity22 was notably absent from a list of allies praised by @entity153 yesterday for standing ' shoulder to shoulder ' with the @entity143			2
the guided - missile cruiser @entity156 launches a @entity158 cruise missile in the @entity159 yesterday @entity25 children hold up debris as they check a damaged house , reportedly hit by @entity143 - led coalition air strikes , in the village of @entity165 in the western @entity167 province mr @entity6 last night insisted @entity22 would play its part in the assault			1
asked about the possibility of @entity22 bombing raids , he said : ' we 're looking carefully at what role we can play in this coalition			2
' we 've already taken a number of steps so far			0
we 've also armed the ( @entity125 fighters )			0
and we will keep looking at what more we can do			0
' but @entity37 former defence minister sir @entity179 said it was becoming a ' national embarrassment ' that the @entity22 was not taking part			2
he insisted : ' we should be standing shoulder to shoulder with the @entity143 and our allies against this utterly brutal group , not sitting on the sidelines			0
' @entity188 , the former defence secretary and standard - bearer for the @entity37 right , said : ' we risk exacerbating the idea , first achieved by the @entity25 vote , that we have opted out of any leadership role in global affairs			0
' mr @entity6 will today plead with @entity196 president @entity195 for his support in the fight against @entity28			1
