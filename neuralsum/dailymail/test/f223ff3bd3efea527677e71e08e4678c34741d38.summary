the federal government is looking to take a hard line with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children			1
under ground breaking reforms , social services minister @entity4 will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who do n't vaccinate their children to claim welfare benefits , including $ 726 from @entity9 , $ 7,500 - a - year from childcare rebate and $ 200 - a - week from the childcare benefit scheme			1

' while doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated , some immunisation experts are worried the move wo n't bolster immunisation rates			1
