by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 11 november 2013 commuters on the @entity2 have been urged to walk instead of taking the train in the latest bid to cut congestion during the rush hour			1
passengers frequently complain that rush hour services on some lines are so packed that it can be hard to find a place to stand comfortably , let alone get a seat			1
but instead of compensating commuters for the poor conditions or increasing the frequency of trains , @entity14 bosses have launched a new campaign to persuade passengers to avoid the @entity2 altogether			1
crush : tube passengers have been urged to avoid public transport during peak rush hour times londoners arriving at @entity27 stations in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 this morning were handed leaflets advising them to consider walking to their destination , according to the @entity34			1
the pamphlets , as well as information boards at the stations , warned commuters to avoid travelling altogether between 8am and 8.45 as part of a pilot scheme to reduce congestion			0
in addition , it was suggested that passengers should walk or cycle between the busiest stations			1
the journey between @entity51 and @entity52 , the stations at either end of the area targeted today , takes seven minutes by train , but by foot would be around 50 minutes			0
moreover , thousands of people commute from @entity56 into the @entity57 or the @entity58 , which would take hours to walk to			0
busy : @entity14 is hoping to reduce the density of passengers at peak times some passengers expressed outraged that they were being told not to take the @entity2 even though many have bought travelcards which cost at least Â£ 1,000 a year			1
others pointed out that - like this morning , when it was raining at the stations involved in the scheme - the weather is often too bad to walk			2
advertising worker @entity70 , 26 , told the @entity34 : ' i ca n't see why @entity14 ca n't put on more trains			2
' @entity74 , the @entity75 ' @entity14 spokesman , added : ' if @entity14 want more people to walk they need to provide an incentive for people to do so , such as travelcard discounts			2
' @entity81 , programme director of @entity14 , insisted that the organisation is not trying to force its customers off trains			0
' we are certainly not calling for everyone to walk , ' he said			0
' we are providing information to customers on when the busiest times are at their stations so that they can make an informed choice on whether to make a small change to their journey , if they are able to			0
' we appreciate that not everyone can change their travel time , but for those who may be able to by making a small change to the time they travel could make their journeys more comfortable			0
' the scheme is based on last year 's @entity106 , when bosses managed to ease congestion on the tube by persuading them to avoid rush hour travel .			2
