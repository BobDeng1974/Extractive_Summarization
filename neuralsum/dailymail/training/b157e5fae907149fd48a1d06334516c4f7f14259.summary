@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has left the door open for @entity3 to return on loan once he moves to @entity5			1
the @entity7 captain will end his 25 - year - long association with his boyhood club this summer when he departs for a new challenge in @entity11			2
principal owner @entity13 and manager @entity14 have both said there will always be a role for the midfielder at the club whenever he decides to return from @entity19 , but @entity20 has not ruled out the possibility of the 34 - year - old pulling on the red shirt again			0
@entity3 ( centre ) could return to @entity1 on loan , according to chief executive @entity0 @entity0 believes that even though @entity3 will leave @entity1 , he will always be allowed to return to the club @entity1 manager @entity14 has said @entity3 will always be welcome at the club ' i 've said openly to @entity3 and his representatives , as have @entity14 and the owners , that we see @entity3 as part of the family , ' he told @entity1 radio station @entity34			1
' the fact that he 's leaving at the end of the season does n't mean it 's the last we 'll see of him at @entity1			2
' what that means , the details are n't known yet , but we will keep a regular dialogue with him and i hope we will see him here again in the long term			0
' asked if that could mean a return on loan next january , @entity0 said : ' it 's conceivable			2
it happens a lot in @entity11 , and it 's something we talked to @entity3 and his representatives about			1
' you ca n't have someone who has so much of the club 's dna in them and just expect that it will go away			0
' last week @entity14 drew a line under the debate over @entity3 's contract after the player said he would have signed a new deal had it been offered last summer			1
@entity1 's approach did not arrive until november , by which time @entity3 was already considering other options having been told by @entity14 his playing time would be managed as the oldest member of the squad			1
@entity0 insists the timing of a ' substantial ' contract offer would not have made a difference			1
@entity0 said even if @entity1 had offered @entity3 a new deal earlier , he still would have questioned his future @entity3 decided to bring his @entity1 career to an end after being told his games would be managed ' let 's assume that we 'd made that offer ( in the summer ) and that he 'd signed it			1
i think we 'd still be in the same position today , ' he added			0
' just like any player , at any club , if he all of a sudden is n't playing every week , they maybe start to think ' maybe this is n't the place for me now '			0
' @entity3 may have signed that contract but we may have been sat round now in the same position			2
' we 've had that before with very senior players			0
i had one come to me and say ' i do n't really fancy this any more '			0
' who knows how it would have played out ? but i think @entity3 made the point last week that it ( not playing every week ) does n't appeal to him			2
@entity3 has said that he wants to leave @entity1 by winning a trophy and finishing in the top four ' so the fact that he would have signed a contract last season actually does n't make any difference			1
' his point was that after playing every week , playing a bit - part role is not how he wanted to finish his career			0
' he wants to finish on a high and i am sure he will			0
