by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 12:31 est , 24 july 2012 a waffle restaurant in @entity2 has gone under , and is blaming @entity3 for its financial woes			1
@entity5 , which opened in april , said it was forced to shutter its doors because of @entity3 ’s sluggish reimbursement plan , co-owner @entity8 claims			1
his site now advertises $ 450 waffles to make up for the lack of money flowing in , saying that he ’d ‘ rather have my hand slammed in a car door than honour your @entity3 coupons			1
’ scroll down for full letter to @entity3 holders out of luck : @entity2 waffle shop @entity5 has gone out of business , and co-owner @entity8 , pictured with his dog @entity25 , blames @entity3 grievances : mr @entity8 is now offering waffles for $ 450 at his shop in the @entity29 of @entity2 the restaurant , which was located in the @entity32 neighbourhood of @entity2 , boasted a simple menu of fluffy waffles and fresh fruit smoothies , as well as coffees and chai			1
but because of @entity3 ’s reimbursement policy , mr @entity8 lamented : ‘ after taking a big chunk of the money as its share , @entity3 holds onto the business ’ share , using it while the business waits			1
and waits , ’ according to @entity48 ’s @entity47 blog , which first reported the story			0
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity50 told @entity51 that their payments to @entity5 were up - to - date			1
furthermore , she said , that only 18 per cent ( or 132 ) @entity53 had been redeemed , meaning that @entity3 was paying the waffle shop ' aggressively ' ahead of customers redeeming the deal			1
ms @entity50 added that in most cases , @entity3 buyers bring in friends and spend beyond the value of the @entity3			1
mr @entity8 said that he waited about a month for the first of three payments , saying that the money was issued as a check rather than being deposited electronically into a bank account			2
the check , he said , then arrived by snail mail			0
but , he said , all of his operating costs – buying ingredients , paying rent and his employees – were due up front , meaning that mr @entity8 had to put money he did n’t get until months later to pay for running his business			0
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity50 told @entity51 in a statement : ' mr @entity8 initially approached @entity3 and our merchant advisors structured a deal to best encourage overspend and help his business grow			1
‘ we also required @entity80 to cap the number of @entity53 sold to ensure the feature was in the best interest of both consumers and the merchant			0
we scheduled his feature on his terms , on a date he selected , under a contract he reviewed and signed			0
according to our records , only 132 @entity53 , or 18 per cent sold , have been redeemed since @entity79 ran two months ago , and mr @entity91 has received 2/3 of his share of the revenue to date			0
‘ we always hate to hear that a local business has decided to close , but the math does not point to @entity3 as the cause			1
' fare enough : @entity80 waffles sold @entity99 waffles , as well as fruit smoothies and coffee ( stock photo ) mr @entity8 did not immediately responded to @entity51 ’s request for comment			1
@entity3 demands payment as soon as coupons are sold to consumers			1
the company then keeps a share , and issues three separate instalments to the business , 25 to 30 days apart , according to the @entity112			0
however , not all business owners are happy with the payment model			1
@entity115 , who owns @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , told the paper last november : ‘ the payment timing is so erratic you ca n’t count on any of that money helping to pay your bills			2
’ he said that it was difficult to keep his business going strong because money is needed immediately in the food business for payments to vendors and staff			2
@entity132 and @entity133 promise the full share in 15 days , while @entity135 says they ’ll pay 80 per cent in the first four days , and the remaining 20 per cent over the next 90 days			0
however , @entity3 spokesperson @entity50 told @entity51 that many businesses prefer the 33/33/33 model			1
they added that many times , they are paid more , because some customers do not redeem the @entity3 before it expires			1
the former waffle restaurant owner told the @entity141 : ‘ @entity3 was a backbreakers			1
we could n’t pay staff or get food or anything			0
the world seemed very dark at that point			0
’ mr @entity8 ’s restaurant was never free from problems			2
several reviewers on @entity151 said that while the waffles were incredible , it was hard to know when the breakfast treat would be there			2
one @entity151 reviewer who went to the restaurant in july wrote : ‘ each time , i was greeted with a sign on the door that said “ re-opening at 12:30 ” because they were out of waffles			1
’ the reviewer said there were always lines out the door , and even then , they were sometimes turned away without explanation			0
however , mr @entity8 puts some of the blame on himself			0
‘ i might have jumped without checking very well , ’ he told the @entity141			0
the $ 450 waffle offering is intentionally sardonic , and so far , mr @entity8 has n’t had any takers			1
other business owners found their @entity3 deal less of a blessing , and more of a bane			2
last november , the @entity174 wrote of a cake shop owner in the @entity176 who featured her specialty cupcakes at a 75 per cent discount			2
need a cake owner @entity179 said at the time that the deal was the worst decision she ever made , and took a $ 19,000 loss in staff overtime and supplies to make the gourmet cupcakes			1
she told the @entity174 : ‘ even a much larger company would have difficulty coping , but my poor staff were having to slog away at oll hours – one of them even came in at 3am because she could n’t sleep for worry			0
’ investors were initially excited at @entity3 ’s ipo which , apart from @entity194 , was the biggest in history			2
but the group deal site posted staggering losses to the tune of $ 42.7million			2
but now , @entity3 stock is worth only $ 7.38 a share , more than 60 per cent lower than its @entity193 price			1
its stock hit record lows the week of july 11th , with analysts citing the @entity206 crisis as a persistent problem			0
the cut was also driven by a reduction in estimates for the company ’s 2013 earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , and amortization			0
the company ’s estimated worth next year is now $ 718million , down from $ 930million , @entity217 reported			0
going public : @entity3 ceo @entity220 seen speaking after @entity3 's ipo last november the system works as follows : subscribers log on to @entity53 ’ ‘ deal - a - day ’ website where they can buy a voucher that offers a number of daily discount deals on anything from restaurant meals to spa treatments			1
the @entity232 - based company uses collective buying power to negotiate bargain - bucket prices with retailers , which become available only if a minimum number of people sign up			2
even though @entity3 takes up to half the price of the vouchers , the retailers and restaurateurs participate in hopes of curating new , loyal customers			2
according to a study earlier this month by @entity247 , the daily deal industry is thriving , contrary to some reports			0
the study claims that these deals by discount sites like @entity132 , @entity3 , @entity251 , and @entity133 bring in 80 per cent new patrons to the business			1
however , the study notes that the daily deals are sustainable to only 30 per cent of businesses			0
here 's our @entity3 story : @entity3 promises to send you lots of new customers			1
the customers buy 50 % off coupons ( two waffles for the price of one , for example )			0
they send the money to @entity3 , which issues them a code			2
the customer brings the code into the shop			0
the shop gives the customer the two waffles , collects the code , and then ' redeems ' , or verifies , the code with @entity3			1
does @entity3 then electronically deposit the money that the customer paid them for the coupon into the business ' bank account overnight like credit card companies do ? no. after taking a big chunk of the money as its share , @entity3 holds on to the business ' share , using it while the business waits			2
after about a month , @entity3 issues the first of three payments to the business			1
then it has to " process " the check , which can take up to ten days			0
then it snail mails the check			0
a month later , the process is repeated for your next installment			0
then , a month later , the process is repeated again for your final installment			0
now , keep in mind , the bulk of the @entity3 activity ( i.e. , the big surge in customers ) occurs at the outset of the @entity3 campaign			2
that means the business has to lay out all the money ( in our case food and labor ) up front to service this expensive campaign , but it takes roughly a month for @entity3 to send the ( deeply discounted ) payment for the waffles those customers ate			1
and even then its only half or less of what is owed			0
the business has to wait for most of the remainder of its money until two months after laying out the cost of the food and labor			0
and for some of the money , it will be three months after honoring the customer 's @entity3 coupon in the shop before the business is paid for that customer			1
that 's the part that i did n't expect and the part that put our new business out of business			0

owner of @entity5 claims @entity3 's slow payments led to closure of restaurant
offering *tongue* - in - cheek $ 450 waffles to compensate loss of income
@entity3 offers three payment installments for merchants
other businesses hurt by @entity3 's model as stock prices continue to *falter*
