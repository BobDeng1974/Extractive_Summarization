but @entity10 ’s only arctic animal is perfectly built for racing down snowy slopes and leaping long distances , without any expensive sporting equipment			1
the hardy mountain hare is a natural athlete native to @entity16 and is built to cope with cold weather			0
alert : @entity10 's only arctic animal - the mountain hare ( pictured ) - is perfectly built for racing down snowy slopes and leaping long distances the mountain hare ( @entity22 ) is adapted to polar and mountainous habitats			1
it lives in the @entity25 and @entity27 's @entity26 in the @entity10			1
it can reach 65cm in length and can weigh up to 5.3kg			0
in the summer , the mountain hare has a brown coat but in preparation for winter it moults into a white pelage			2
however , its tail stays white all year round , distinguishing the species from the @entity39 hare			2
most active in the evening and at night , mountain hares rest with their backs to the wind , sheltered by rocks and heather in the day time			1
some wildlife experts are concerned that as global warming reduces the amount of snowfall in parts of the @entity10 , the survival of mountain hares could be threatened as they risk being exposed in the wrong colour coat			1
they are preyed upon by foxes , stoats , birds of prey and cats			0
the animals live in arctic conditions in countries from @entity60 to eastern @entity61 , as well as in @entity10			1
in addition to powerful legs which allow them to leap long distances and race across snowy slopes , mountain hares have the ability to turn their fur white during colder months to blend into their surroundings and avoid predators			1
photographer @entity72 , 49 , who regularly travels to @entity16 to take wildlife pictures , spent two days in the @entity25 photographing the hares			2
‘ it was incredible to be so close to these amazing creatures and watch them go about their business , ’ he said			0
‘ to avoid predators they have learned a trick of standing completely still for long periods of time - eagles ca n't spot motionless prey			1
‘ then , suddenly , they will run away really fast			0
they take off , getting air as they leap over the hillsides - this is the best of @entity10 's animal winter olympians , ’ he added			1

earlier this month , mr @entity72 , from @entity114 in @entity115 spent between four and five hours a day photographing the hares			0
@entity116 : the hares have the ability to turn their fur white during colder months which allows them to blend into the environment and avoid predators ‘ it was a great experience			1
i was surrounded by some of the most beautiful countryside in the world			0
the @entity25 look incredible covered in the recent snow , ’ he said			2
‘ i have never followed hares around before and i now think they are fascinating creatures			0

speedy : some species of hares can reach top speeds of 45mph - roughly equivalent to the average course speed for an @entity111 downhill skier			0
they can also leap three metres in a single bound secretive : the hares need this to blend in with their surroundings because their main enemy - the golden eagle - has eyesight up to eight times sharper than a human 's and can spot its dinner from hundreds of metres away ‘ they 're brilliant escape artists , moulting into pure white coats to blend in with the snow			2
when they hunker down against the ground , only their black ear tips give them away			0
in spring when the snow and ice melts , they grow back their brown coats			0
‘ the hares really do need this amazing camouflage because their main enemy - the golden eagle - has eyesight up to eight times sharper than ours and can spot its dinner from hundreds of metres away			0
’ mountain hares are native to @entity10 - unlike brown hares in the lowlands , which the @entity171 probably brought here			1
but you 'll have to go to the @entity25 or @entity27 's @entity26 to see them			1
