by @entity0 published : 08:51 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 2 august 2012 pollen from a garden has helped to identify the killer of a nine - year - old boy 28 years after the shocking crime			1
police announced today they had solved the mystery of @entity9 ’s murder and named his uncle @entity10 as the killer			1
@entity10 , a convicted predatory paedophile , died from natural causes in prison four years ago at the age of 65 while still a suspect for the schoolboy ’s murder			1
murder mystery : police claim they have solved the 28 year mystery of who murdered @entity9 , pictured left , through scientific advances and named his uncle @entity10 , pictured right , as his killer however , thanks to new scientific advances , vital forensic evidence was obtained linking @entity10 ’s garden to the victim			1
unusual pollen spores and other plant material specific to @entity10 ’s garden were found on @entity9 ’s clothing			1
and a brick found with the schoolboy ’s body was forensically shown to have been part of a water feature in @entity10 ’s garden			0
@entity10 lived a 10 - minute walk away from the house where @entity9 was staying the night he vanished in march 1984			1
the schoolboy was left alone with an 18 - month - old baby for about 70 minutes when the toddler ’s father went to the pub. he returned to find @entity9 missing and called police			2
final piece of the puzzle : scientific advances meant that unusual pollen spores and plant material found on @entity9 's clothing were matched with those in @entity10 's garden ( stock image ) his body was found two days later in a beck			1
he had been savagely beaten to death with a blunt instrument and there was evidence of a sexual assault			0
@entity9 had been placed inside a large plastic bag weighed down by an ornamental brick - later found to be from @entity10 ’s garden			1
the killer eluded detectives , but a breakthrough came in march 2002 when the boy ’s uncle @entity10 was arrested for sexually assaulting four young boys who were known to him			1
although some of these crimes dated back to the late 1980s they all took place after the murder			0
@entity10 was jailed for seven - and - a - half years in april 2003 and a police review of the unsolved murder showed a strong circumstantial case against him			1
he lived locally , owned a car which fitted the description of a vehicle seen near the victim ’s house on the night , he did not have an alibi , had previous knowledge of the beck where the body was dumped and was shown to have lied to police about key issues in the case			0
@entity10 had the ‘ means and motive ’ but the case ‘ lacked the final piece of a very complex jigsaw ’ because there was no scientific evidence against him			0
all hope of a confession ended when @entity10 died in 2008 , three weeks before he was due to be released from prison			1
when historical dna analysis drew a blank detective superintendent @entity94 of @entity95 asked dr @entity96 , a leading expert in the study of pollen and plant spores , to look at the case			0
she concluded there was enough ‘ unusual pollen and other plant material ’ on the clothing @entity9 was wearing when he was killed to link him to @entity10 ’s garden			2
@entity95 said when dr @entity96 finished her work last year there was ‘ scientific evidence to show that @entity9 had been in close contact with @entity10 ’s garden the night he went missing			2
’ an independent review of the evidence by a leading criminal @entity114 concluded had @entity10 been alive the evidence would have led to a charge of murder and a realistic chance of conviction			2
@entity120 , @entity114 , described the weight of evidence as ‘ conclusive			0
’ @entity9 ’s mother was said to be relieved that ‘ some unanswered questions have now been answered ’ but police said she still finds the subject of her son ’s murder ‘ too painful to talk about			2
’ det supt @entity94 said : ‘ @entity10 was an evil man and a man wholly without remorse			0
i am satisfied that @entity9 ’s family can have some sense of closure and understanding of what happened			0
‘ this case has taken many years to resolve			0
we would all wish the evidence to convict were available sooner and whilst @entity10 was still alive to face trial , however that was not to be			0
‘ the few officers still working on this case , between their other duties , have been determined to do all possible to solve the case and have simply refused to give up			0

police have named the killer of @entity9 , nine , as his uncle @entity10 28 years after the murder
convicted predatory paedophile @entity10 died in prison four years ago
