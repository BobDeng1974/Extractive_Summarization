by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity4 mom accused of murdering her two teen children was ' without a doubt ' insane at the time of the slayings , a psychologist testified monday			1
however , prosecutors argue that 53 - year - old @entity10 knew what she was doing when she shot dead daughter @entity13 , 16 , and son @entity14 , 13 , in january 2011 - and has simply convinced everyone into believing she 's crazy			1
they both agreed that she was insane at the time of the slayings			1
pictured monday in court after spending 20 hours with @entity10 , and reviewing the accused 's medical history , dr @entity16 diagnosed her as bi-polar with psychotic features			1
' i think without a doubt that she was insane at the time of the shooting and during the week prior to the shooting , ' dr @entity31 told the jury			1
' even psychopaths do n't kill their own children			2
' ' they may be able to kill other people 's children , but sane people have it wired in their dna to protect their children , ' she added			2

did n't know it was wrong : psychologist dr @entity16 testified monday saying sane people do n't kill their children and that @entity10 believed she was helping them by bringing them to heaven with her six months before the killings , @entity10 went off her medications , resulting in a ' downward spiral ' which ended with @entity13 and @entity14 's deaths			1
around that time , @entity10 started behaving bizarely , telling her therapist that she wanted to get pregnant at the age of 49 so she could immediately give the child up for adoption			1
dr @entity16 believes @entity10 wanted to commit suicide , but did n't want to leave her children motherless - fearing that her daughter was becoming bi-polar and that her son would be molested just like her			1

after shooting dead her two children , @entity10 took several pills which put her to sleep - but did not prove lethal			1
failed plan : @entity10 planned to kill herself after shooting dead kids @entity13 , 16 ( left ) , and @entity14 , 13 ( right )			1

' she was very upset because she did n't succeed at killing herself			0
' forensic psychiatrist dr @entity85 also testified and agrees that @entity10 was legally insane at the time of the shootings			1
' my conclusion is she knew what she was doing ... but she did not know it was wrong			0
she believed she was protecting her children from something that was terribly horrible ; she believed she was going to stay with her children and bring them with her to heaven , and it was a part of her necessary duty as a mother to do this , ' dr @entity85 said			2
however , the prosecution has been arguing that the slayings were premeditated , and not the result of a mental breakdown			0
@entity10 talks with attorney @entity102 on tuesday , may 6 , 2014 the jury previously heard recordings of @entity10 telling detectives that her teens were mean and that she hoped they were dead just hours after their bodies were found			2

the last straw , ' @entity10 said in the interview , ' my daughter , the 16 - year - old , is mouthy			2
