a judge ruled that a severely anorexic and alcoholic woman should not be force fed and kept alive after she wrote to him saying : ' i am prepared to die '			1
the woman , suffering an ' unusual ' combination of anorexia nervosa and alcohol dependency , wrote to mr @entity9 to tell him she wanted to spend whatever time she had left ' doing nice things '			1
in the moving letter , presented to the @entity13 , she said ; ' whatever time i have left i just want to live each day alongside my granddad and ( siblings ) , who are my world			1
' i want them to know " me " rather than this illness and to have some nice memories of our time together			1
' in a moving letter , presented to the @entity13 , an anorexic and alcoholic woman has begged not to be force fed , saying : ' whatever time i have left i just want to live each day alongside my granddad and ( siblings ) , who are my world ' mr @entity9 , who described the case as ' unusual and desperately sad ' , said no one involved could be identified to protect the woman 's privacy			1
the woman told him that she was ' fully aware ' of what was wrong with her and what the ' effects of my wish to refuse treatments ' would be			2
the judge , who was told that the woman 's life was in ' imminent danger ' , ruled last month that she should not be force - fed or forced to have treatment following a hearing in the @entity13 - where cases involving sick and vulnerable people are analysed - in @entity48			1
but detail of her letter did not emerge until today , when mr @entity9 published a written analysis of the case			1
the judge , who described the woman as ' young ' , said anorexia nervosa had dominated her life for the past 14 years			2
he said a ' psychological dependence ' on alcohol had caused ' end stage ' irreversible liver disease			0
she had been trapped in an ' increasingly destructive revolving door of treatment and recurrent illness ' and had been admitted to hospital more than 45 times in 11 years - sometimes being detained under the provisions of mental health legislation			2
an @entity71 trust had asked the judge to make rulings on what was in the woman 's best interests			0
doctors said they thought it was in her best interests not to be force - fed or forced to have treatment			1
the judge reproduced the letter the woman had written to him in his ruling			1
mr @entity9 described the case as ' unusual and desperately sad ' ' i understand the professionals concerns and the effect that this has had on all of them and i do recognise that everyone wants for the best , ' the woman wrote in it			1
' however i feel i have had enough of the continual pressure of mental health staff and services ... and that rather than helping me , it is actually making me worse			0
' it is hard for everyone but there is a lot i ca n't deal with concerning therapy - it 's just not something i have found able to be involved in , it 's just too hard			0
' but i am also fully aware that there is support and treatment still available if ever i want it			0
' i am fully aware of what is wrong with my health and the effects of my wish to refuse treatments will have upon it			0
' whatever time i have left i just want to live each day alongside my granddad and ( siblings ) , who are my world			1
' i want them to know ' me ' rather than this illness and to have some nice memories of our time together			2
' i want to be able to look forward each day to doing ' nice ' things			2
' she added : ' the whole journey is mentally and emotionally horrible for everyone			0
' i 've got support from my nearest and dearest and that is really all the support i want now and in the future			0
' i can only hope that you really hear what i am saying and what i truly hope can happen			0
' mr @entity9 said evidence showed the woman had suffered a ' range of harmful childhood experiences '			1
he said the woman 's childhood traumas had left ' deep wounds ' and manifested themselves through her ' psychological disturbance '			2
she had used her eating disorder and alcohol as ' props to enable her to function '			0
' this is an unusual and desperately sad case , ' said the judge			0
' so far as i can do so , i have endeavoured to put myself in the place of ( the woman ) and guided by what she has directly told me and others			0
' he added : ' i have reached the clear conclusion that i should not compel treatment for ( her ) anorexia			0
