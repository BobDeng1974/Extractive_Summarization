the @entity8 18 - inch rail howitzer gun serial number @entity9 is one of just twelve railway guns left in the world			1
it was manufactured by the @entity14 set up in 1864			2
the gun , which weighs 200 tons , has been on display at @entity17 , @entity18 , since 2008 but today it began its 387 - mile journey to the @entity20			2
@entity2 's largest surviving artillery piece , the @entity8 18inch @entity24 gun , is being transported to the @entity4 for an exhibition to mark the 300th anniversary of the @entity27 in 1940 an 18 - inch rail @entity28 ( pictured here at @entity29 ) , was stationed at @entity30 , @entity31 on the @entity32 to @entity34 line as a defence against possible @entity37 invasion there , the gun will be displayed as part of their @entity42 exhibition to commemorate the end of the @entity45 in 1713			1
in preparation for the move the artillery piece , which was in service between 1920 and 1945 , has undergone restoration work after a campaign to return it to good condition			2
there are only twelve surviving railway guns in the world but the 200 ton @entity8 18inch @entity57 is the largest surviving of all @entity60 artillery pieces today the @entity62 gun began its 387 - mile journey to the @entity20 where it will be part of the @entity42 exhibition the @entity45 ( 1701 – 1714 ) was fought between two alliances of @entity68 powers , including a divided @entity69 , over who had the right to succeed @entity72 as king of spain			1
in 1704 an @entity75 - @entity20 force captured @entity76 from @entity69 during the war of the @entity69 succession			1
the territory was then ceded to @entity2 under the @entity6 in 1713			1
it was signed by representatives of @entity82 of @entity83 and @entity84 of @entity69 , and representatives of @entity86 of @entity2 , the @entity87 , the @entity88 of @entity89 and the @entity90 on the other			1
sergeant maj @entity92 told the @entity93 it took up to five hours to get the gun off the carriageway and onto a truck			2
' it 's a complex beast			2
the size , weight and the fact that it has been together for a few years causes its own issues			2
but we 've done a lot of pre-preparatory work to make sure it can be split , ' he said			0
' it 's most certainly going to be an abnormal load			0
' @entity62 artillery pieces typically have relatively short barrels and use comparatively small propellant charges to propel missiles high into the air			1
the barrels were built during the @entity114 but were completed too late to see action			0
they were later used to test the accuracy of the 18 - inch @entity62 in @entity118 , @entity119			1
their relatively short range of around 13 miles meant that after the @entity114 the five guns produced were put into storage because longer range weapons were needed			1
the howitzer 's range was insufficient for @entity128 firing and hence it was never fired in action			1
in late 1940 one 18 - inch howitzer was brought out of retirement and fitted onto its 95 ton proofing sleigh			0
it was deployed on the railway mounting @entity135 which had been used in the @entity114 to carry a 14 - inch gun			0
the @entity8 18 - inch rail howitzer gun serial number @entity9 was in service from 1920 to 1945			1
it was one of five made in @entity2 by the @entity14			0
it weighs nearly 200 tonnes and its barrel measures 52ft			0
the gun 's shells weighed nearly 180 stone			0
@entity146 varied between 0 ° - 40 ° and its effective range was 13 miles			1
it takes five hours to shift the gun from its carriageway over to the truck which transports it			0
the gun was stationed at @entity30 in @entity31 on the @entity32 to @entity154 as a coast defence gun			2
it remained there until 1943 as a precaution against possible @entity37 invasion			0
barrel no @entity160 was the only one of @entity2 's railway guns to avoid being dismantled and scrapped in the early 1960s			0
it was was sent back to @entity118 to test fire the efficacy of 1,000lb @entity165 before finally being retired in november 1959			0
the howitzer and proofing sleigh were moved to @entity168 , the then home of the @entity169 , in june 1991 , where it was gifted to the @entity171			0
after 17 years it was moved to @entity17 in 2008			0
in the @entity4 the gun will form the centrepiece of the exhibition , to open on march 30 in a grand official opening ceremony involving many dignitaries			1
it will remain there until september this year , before returning to the @entity60 to a location yet to be confirmed .			0
