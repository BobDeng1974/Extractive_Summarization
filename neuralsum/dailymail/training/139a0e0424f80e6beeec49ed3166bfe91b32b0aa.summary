a gang - rape victim who has spent years battling for the victim compensation she was promised after she was attacked by three men in 2008 says she ’s extremely disappointed with the @entity3 after she took a petition signed by 120,000 supporters to them and was basically palmed off			1
' i 'm stuck in a bureaucratic nightmare , ’ @entity6 told @entity9			2
' i did get quite emotional at points i tried to hold it together to be taken seriously			0
’ @entity12 has spent six years fighting for full compensation after she was raped on the banks of a river at 20 - years - old but budget cuts meant she only received less than half of the amount she was once promised			1
on wednesday she bravely took a petition signed by 120,000 supporters to @entity23 attorney - general @entity22 in @entity24 in the hope that he would reverse the decision			1
‘ i was disappointed … they have promised to review it , ’ @entity12 said as she explained how she was told they wo n’t have time to look at it before parliament stops sitting next week and no legislation will be changed until next year after the state election			0
‘ they have n’t given me a time frame … they are not willing to do anything , ’ she said			0
‘ they were basically sorry to hear what had happened to me and the attorney - general is going to go over the petition and read the comments from everyone who signed it , ’ she added			1
despite the devastating setback , @entity12 said she is not going to stop fighting on behalf of all the victims who have had their compensation cut			0
‘ i ’m disappointed but it means that i ’m going to keep fighting and pushing to become a priority … they gave no indication to what they are prioritising , ’ she added			0
@entity12 is campaigning to have retrospective cuts to compensation reversed she is fighting to receive full compensation for the gang rape she experienced six years ago @entity12 has been overwhelmed by the public support she has received since launching her petition and waiving her right to anonymity as a rape victim			1
‘ i did n’t really think 120,000 signatures would be that heavy , to feel all that weight was amazing , ’ she said			0
she explained she has been contacted by hundreds more sexual assault victims , some of whom are still waiting for compensations and others who have had their lump payments cut			0
‘ i ’m going keep trying and i ’m not going to give up … they are all thanking me for the strength to come out and give a voice to the people who want to remain anonymous still …			0
all these people , it ’s just so amazing , ’ she said			0
@entity23 attorney - general @entity22 greeted her in @entity24 and took the ' very heavy ' box of 120,000 signatures the pair were engaged in an hour and a half meeting in @entity24 on wednesday @entity12 has been overwhelmed by the support from the public after she came forward with her story @entity12 recently told her story on the @entity94 ’s 7:30 report			1
she said she has relived the nightmare every day since three men attacked her in @entity97 in @entity24 ’s outer - west after she met one of them at her local @entity99 at @entity100 's			1
after her parents went home she stayed at the club to have a drink and play on the pokies when she met a young man and quickly struck up a rapport			0
' he seemed like a really nice guy - we started talking and we had a lot in common at the time , so i had no reason to be in fear of the man - i was just having a good time , ' she said she agreed to go dancing with him at a nightclub and when he brought two friends to join them she was not alarmed			0
ms @entity6 said she used to be a ' happy - go - lucky kind of girl ' before the vicious attack when they ended up driving 20 kilometres to @entity97 to a riverbank for ‘ a few beers ’ , she convinced herself not to worry and ended up having consensual sex with the man she ’d met earlier			1
but when she opened her eyes and saw his friends surrounding them , he told his mates ‘ sharing ’s caring , get down here			0
’ a distraught ms @entity6 told 7.30 last week : ‘ that 's when the other two took turns at raping me			1
’ ' they just got on top of me and spread my legs apart and one of them was holding the top part of my body down so that that i could n't get up and they just had sex with me , ' she said			0
now ms @entity6 is too frightened to go out as she has relived the horror everyday for the past six years the @entity99 at @entity100 's where ms @entity6 met the man who invited his two mates to join them ms @entity6 had spent the night with her family at the club before she decided to stay a bit longer on her own the men drove back to @entity100 's and dumped her at a petrol station where the attendant called the police who took her to hospital for a rape examination			1
' i had to sit around for hours with their dna inside me - it was horrible - i just wanted to have a shower , ' she recalled			0
when it came to appearing in court ms @entity6 could not bear to relive the rape under cross-examination and the men were not convicted			1
despite this ms @entity6 is entitled to victim compensation and because there were two or three offenders her rape was classified as a category assault and she was meant to receive between $ 25,000 to $ 50,000			1
ms @entity6 ’s case was finally approved in june but she was appalled when she was awarded just $ 15,000			1
‘ i 've paid through the nose for psychological help to recover but because the government still has n't paid my victims of crime compensation – 6 years since being raped – it 's meant i 've been in debt and had to borrow money from friends and family just to get help , ' ms @entity6 said			1
in 2013 , the government retrospectively changed the legislation to cut the amount of compensation and support for gang rape victims			2
‘ i do n't understand why they 're doing this to me			0
i ca n't fully move on because the government wo n't finalise my case , ' she said			0
' to me it says the government does n't care about victims - all it cares about is saving some money			2
' ms @entity6 is desperately trying to rebuild life after the brutal gang rape at just 20 - years - old she said she desperately needs compensation to assist with the ongoing psychological help ms @entity6 said she is scarred for life from the traumatic experience			1
' i used to be a really happy - go - lucky kind of girl - i used to go out with my friends all of the time – i do n't go out anymore at all , ' she said			2
' it ’s living in fear every moment of the day - it ’s the nightmares that wake me up and i ca n't get a proper sleep most nights			2
' she is desperately trying to move on from the horror of that night six years ago			1
' now i just want this to all be over , to have closure on this and be able to get the ongoing help i need to recover , ’ she said			0
' it ruined my life they took away from me something that was n't theirs - i can still hear them laughing at me in their dreams			2
' determined not to give up on fighting , ms @entity6 started a change.org petition			1
‘ this is very hard for me to talk about			0

the nightmares and flashbacks still terrify me			0
’ in a devastating plea for help she added : ‘ i ca n't even describe how horrific being gang - raped was - it will haunt me forever , but what 's even worse is the toll it 's taken on my life			1
' to make matters worse - the financial impact is also taking its toll			0
