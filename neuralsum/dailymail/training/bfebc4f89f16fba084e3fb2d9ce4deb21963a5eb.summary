@entity1 's hopes of qualifying for the last 16 of the @entity3 hang in the balance following their 1 - 0 defeat away to @entity6 on tuesday night			1
@entity8 's decisive goal means the @entity9 have now lost three successive games in @entity11 with only two matches remaining			0
@entity1 boss @entity13 has come under fire for his team selection against @entity6 - opting to not include seven first - team starters from his line - up			1
we asked @entity21 fansite 's @entity19 his views on @entity13 ' tactics			2
for 5000 @entity1 fans lucky enough to travel to @entity6 and take in the whole experience of a @entity26 away the feeling on wednesday wo n't be one of despondency about the result			1
@entity1 lost against @entity6 , their third @entity3 defeat in succession but , as many will tell you , there 's a lot more to a @entity26 away trip than the game itself			1
the match at the @entity40 was n't all that bad , at least if you forget about the score , if you look at it in the context of what has been awful season so far for @entity1			2
@entity1 boss @entity13 has come under criticism for his team selection against @entity6 the @entity1 team line - up in the @entity50 before the clash with @entity6 without seven first - team regulars @entity1 substitutes ( from left ) @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity59 warm - up before the match - all five started their 1 - 0 league defeat at @entity62 on saturday over 5000 @entity1 fans made the trip to the @entity50 expecting @entity13 to field his possible strongest team the players drafted in from @entity13 ' backup list performed well , in many cases putting in a better shift than those he might consider first choice			1
yet there was always a sense that @entity6 could do far more than they were actually doing in this game			2
for @entity13 to announce that the @entity3 was behind the @entity76 in his priorities was a low point during his reign , a sign he did n't really understand what that trophy meant to the fans that have continued to sing his name even during the wobbles of this term			1
there is still time for him to get the season back in the right direction , but he is really testing the fans ' loyalty			0
the players he put out tuesday night helped him , to some extent , but that 's based on a gradual lowering of expectations over the course of a season			0
perhaps the best indication of what the competition means to @entity1 fans , and what the expectations were at the outset , comes from skipper @entity55 , one of those @entity13 chose to leave on the bench tuesday night			1
@entity8 ( left ) scored the only goal of the game to condemn @entity1 to their third defeat in @entity11 @entity8 runs to the delighted home supporters after giving his team the lead against @entity1 @entity1 captain @entity55 came on as a second half substitute against @entity6 on tuesday night @entity55 ( centre ) had spoke of his excitement to face @entity6 after the @entity3 draw was made speaking after the @entity3 draw had been made , @entity55 said : ' it was massive - i planned my whole day around the @entity3 draw			1
we could n't wait for it , it was so exciting			0
i 've missed it so much			0
there 's almost a jealousy when you watch the @entity3 and you 're not involved in it			0
' they ( @entity6 ) were one of the sides that all of the players wanted , and certainly the supporters			0
' expectations are kept in place by the hope that sooner or later @entity1 will actually find some form , like last year			0
there is still some time for that to happen but @entity13 needs to show some honesty with the fans - who listen to everything he says to the press - and maybe a bit of passion if he wants their support through what will undoubtedly be some difficult weeks ahead			2
@entity1 duo @entity146 ( centre ) and @entity148 have failed to impress since joining the club in the summer @entity13 himself was feeding expectations , promising fans ' an exciting time ' this season , thanks to the ' great work ' he 'd done and was about to do with new signings			1
' the idea is by the end of august we 'll have the squad together and it will be a really exciting time for us next season , ' he promised			0
around £ 120million spent later - mixed of course with the loss of @entity165 - @entity1 have been far from exciting			2
back in march , referring to @entity166 , @entity13 said ' a team that spent £ 100m … must have been hoping to challenge for the league			2
' but not @entity1 ? @entity13 raised expectations , increased hope , then struggled to deliver what he 'd suggested was on its way			1
he 's still got time to deliver it , but no more time to waste			0
