by @entity0 published : 23:02 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 03:33 est , 29 november 2013 dark , desolate and shrouded in mist , these evocative scenes of @entity2 show a city far removed from its brash confident city we know today			2
regarded the world over as the city of romance and the centre of bohemian culture , the @entity9 capital was unrecognisable in 1946 , when @entity16 photographer @entity15 travelled there to shoot a profile for life magazine			1
instead of winding passageways where art , music and food spilled out of every building , @entity15 was met with a city in recovery from the second global conflict in a decade			2
@entity27 : taken in february 1946 , the images by @entity15 show @entity2 as a city recovering from the ravages of the second world war , here people are pictured buying flowers from a stall near the banks of @entity36 @entity38 memories : the @entity16 photographer was immediately struck by the tragic landscapes of the bohemian city which was far from the brash @entity2 we know today post war winter : a lone mourner walks through the @entity45 in the capital			1
for the second time in a generation , people in @entity48 were coming to terms with the human cost of war in the cold winter when he visited , @entity9 was still finding her feet after the defeat of @entity57 with many in the capital struggling to find jobs , shelter and even food to feed their families			2
but rather than leave disappointed , the snapper said he instantly fell in love with the haunting beauty of the city and began shooting straight away			0
the result is this collection of pictures which document the human cost of war on one of the the world 's most vibrant of cities			0
despite his enthusiasm for what he saw , life , where not so kind , telling its readers @entity2 was a ' grim and depressing disappointment ' and describing the locals as ' cold , hungry , confused and tired — above all , tired — too busy keeping themselves alive to bother much about entertaining			0
' speaking of what the typical @entity16 gi must have thought when he entered the famous city , life wrote : ' where was the @entity2 he had heard about ? where were the naked women ? ' gloomy : the dark , towered mass of the @entity93 and @entity94 , seen from the riverbank			0
@entity15 said he was so enraptured by the city 's elegance that he began taking pictures as soon as he arrived iconic : the skyline of @entity2 , right , is now known the world over for its association with romance and glamour , but @entity15 's pictures show a city in mourning , where hunger and unemployment were rife			1
tradesman like flower sellers , left , went back to work but many people struggled to find food , jobs or even keep warm in the winter of 1946 desolate : here the @entity93 looms ominously over the banks of the @entity118 which is now one of the most commonly visited areas of the @entity9 capital evocative : the black and white images , such as this showing a river barge churning up the @entity118 past @entity125 ( left ) , moved @entity126 to brand the city ' grim and depressing '			1
a shot of the @entity129 ( right ) shows how , despite @entity9 winning the war , @entity2 was not in a state of post-war celebration in 1946 deserted : now one of the great tourist attractions of the world , the @entity133 museum stands empty as the world recovers from yet another terrible conflict			0

the *stunning* set of pictures were taken by @entity16 photographer @entity15 for a @entity126 feature
the snapper said he was moved by the tragic beauty of the city which was in mourning after @entity149
black and white images show the human effect of war with many @entity154 at the time starving and poor
