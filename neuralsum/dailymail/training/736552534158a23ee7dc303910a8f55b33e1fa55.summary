the first full - scale tidal generator in @entity1 has been unveiled in an attempt to reduce the @entity4 's carbon emissions			1
the device , an underwater turbine mounted on a free - standing base , will be installed in @entity8 , @entity9			1
its backers say it will be among the world 's first demonstration devices connected to the grid to generate green , renewable and predictable tidal power			1
after a 12 - month testing period , up to nine tidal devices will be installed off @entity26 in @entity9 to form a 10 megawatt array			1
the @entity29 device , developed by @entity30 ( tel ) weighs 150 tonnes , and has a 52ft by @entity32 ( 16 metre by 20 metre ) frame			2
@entity34 - based @entity30 claims its tidal generator is at the cutting edge of green technology , with three separate horizontal axis turbines mounted on a common triangular frame			2

each turbine has a 49ft ( 15 metre ) diameter rotor which is connected to a generator to produce electricity both the ebb and flood tides the @entity29 device developed by tidal stream technology company @entity30 will be among the world 's first demonstration devices connected to the grid to generate green , renewable and predictable tidal power each turbine has a 49ft ( 15 metre ) diameter rotor which is connected to a generator to produce electricity both the ebb and flood tides			1
it does not require expensive drilling into the seabed , the company claims , and has features to minimise impacts on the environment			0
' the imminent launch of @entity29 , and the supply chain that now exists as a consequence of its development , marks the birth of the tidal industry in @entity1 , ' said @entity30 's managing director @entity70			1
' we remain committed to leading the expansion of the industry and to the creation of green jobs by building on the wealth of expertise present in the @entity4 and the country 's plentiful resources			0
' the @entity29 tidal turbine will be installed in @entity8 in @entity9 on the @entity1 coast strong tides and crashing waves can produce huge amounts of energy – and the @entity4 , with its long coastlines , is in an ideal position to harness this power			1
@entity30 received £ 8 million funding for the project from the @entity92 , and match - funded by majority shareholder welsh renewables company @entity94 , which will join forces with @entity96 to install the further devices			0
@entity99 chief executive dr @entity98 said : ' many of our ocean energy members are currently racing to deploy the first wave or tidal farm , with several of these types of devices instead of just one			2
' when that happens the sector will move into mass production , costs will fall dramatically , and wave and tidal will be well on their way to becoming major players in the @entity4 energy system			0
' overall , the marine energy industry has been forecast to be worth £ 6.1 billion ( $ 10.3 billion ) to the @entity4 economy by 2035 , creating nearly 20,000 jobs			0
in february , plans were submitted to develop the world 's first tidal lagoon energy project in the @entity4			1
the project could provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in @entity124 , @entity1 for 120 years			0
developers behind the @entity127 project believe it could be the first step in developing lagoon technology that could meet 10 per cent of the @entity4 's electricity needs from the tide			2
the scheme would involve a six - mile ( 9.5km ) wall built around @entity127 , which would create a lagoon in the @entity135 with turbines that could harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day			0
if it gets the go - ahead , the lagoon could be the first of a series of five developments around the @entity4 , coast which could generate as much as 10 per cent of the @entity4 's electricity by 2023			2
@entity145 , the company behind the project , said it hopes that 65 per cent of expenditure will be in the @entity4 , boosting a home grown supply chain and creating a possible future export market .			0

the first device will be installed in @entity8 , @entity9
it is among the world 's first tidal power devices connected to the grid
after a year of testing , up to nine tidal devices will be installed off @entity26 in @entity9 to form a 10 megawatt array
