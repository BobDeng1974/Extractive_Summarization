being backed into a corner is the kind of scenario that instinctively appeals to @entity3 , and on tuesday night he duly came out fighting to keep his hopes alive at the @entity5			1
buoyed by the unconditional support of nearly 18,000 in @entity9 's @entity8 , knowing that defeat would effectively end his season , the 27 year - old @entity6 defused the sometimes erratic power of @entity14 @entity13			1
his 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 victory was a far more convincing display than he managed in his opener against @entity18 and keeps him in the hunt for a semi-final place when he plays @entity21 on thursday in the last round robin stage			1
' @entity13 did not serve as well as he can and that helped			0
it is always a pleasure to play against @entity21 - i am looking forward to it			2
he is one of the greatest ever			0
i will need to play well to get through			0
' the mathematics of qualification now becomes infernal and , depending on the outcome of @entity18 's singles against @entity13 , he could still beat the @entity52 master and go out			0
in fact 16 different permutations of results present themselves on thursday , but by the time he goes on court he will know exactly what he has to do			0
with tuesday night 's straight sets triumph @entity3 ensured that the @entity52 is not automatically through , despite him earlier registering his second win with a 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 win over the @entity61			1
@entity21 needs to win just one set to make the semis , and given that he has beaten @entity3 relatively easily on all three occasions he has met him in @entity9 it will be a tall order for the @entity6			1
calculators may need to be at the ready , although if @entity13 wins any kind of victory will be enough for the @entity71 player			0
after careering round @entity72 and @entity73 to try and qualify for this event â€“ battling against the odds again bringing out his best - a place in the last four would be fitting reward for the @entity71 number one			2
there is plenty to do yet as @entity21 has looked very impressive and he never drops his intensity for this occasionally testy rivalry			0
@entity13 's his hair obediently stood to attention as usual on tuesday , but luckily for @entity3 his overall game was less orderly			2
for the most part the @entity6 tended towards the solid rather than spectacular , but with the @entity14 's first serve missing half the time and his forehand contributing 23 unforced errors he created enough openings to squeeze through			0
@entity3 makes a grand entrance at the @entity8 in @entity9 ahead of the clash against @entity13 @entity3 smiles at a mascot as he enters the court on day three of the tournament the evening crowd was notably more partisan than sunday , and if @entity3 was seeking assurance that not everyone down south has deserted him in the wake of his nationalist leaning tweeting activity in september then this was it			1
he seemed to feed off that , having looked flat on sunday			0
after missing two break points in the fourth game poked back a 136 mph serve at 3 - 2 on another break point which @entity13 obligingly sent back beyond the baseline			2
when @entity3 went ahead for 2 - 1 in the second all the momentum was on his side , only for his habit of handing breaks straight back to resurface , and the @entity14 duly levelled			2
the confidence seeped back into @entity13 and @entity3 , his language occasionally matching the blue court colour , was forced to cling on as his opponent produced his best tennis			2
@entity3 , with a poppy on his sleeve , wipes his face with a towel during a break in play one direction star @entity125 attended the match and was cheering on @entity3 then the home player pulled out two brilliant defensive backhands from being way out of position and that gave him what turned out to be the decisive break			0
serving it out was not comfortable , but one last wayward @entity13 forehand did the trick			0
earlier @entity21 had passed more landmarks in his remarkable career when he notched what was his 70th win of the season			2
nobody as old as 33 has scored that many victories in a year , as far back as @entity30 records go , and he is now only seven off completing a thousand over his whole career			0
he was again utterly convincing as he kept alive his slender hopes of usurping @entity147 for the year end number one ranking			0
he said he was already delighted with the sheer volume of wins achieved in this rebound season : ' i think it ( 70 ) is a great number			0
i played only the big tournaments this year , i chased all the @entity156 events , the @entity157			0
it 's not easy to win in them because the margins are small			0

he could lose to @entity21 on thursday and still qualify
