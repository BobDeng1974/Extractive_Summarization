by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 15 march 2013 with a combined weight of more than three quarters of a ton - @entity3 and @entity4 like nothing better than spending their days with their snouts in the trough			1
but somehow the pigs - thought to be @entity12 's fattest breeding pair - still manage to find time for love , producing more than 70 piglets between them at @entity17 , near @entity18 , @entity19 during the last two years			1
at 925lbs , @entity3 is so heavy he can easily crush an average - sized female during mating - but @entity4 is big enough to bear his enormous bulk			1
the porkers have a combined weight of three quarters of a ton huge : two - year - old @entity31 feeds @entity3 an apple			1
he and @entity4 have produced an astonishing 70 piglets together size : mr @entity25 reckons @entity3 and @entity4 are the heaviest breeding couple in the country the crossbreed @entity39 / @entity38 pigs are so big they could be made into around 10,000 sausages			1
@entity3 is around six times bigger than the slaughter weight of the average pig			1
he is carrying an estimated 112lbs of bacon , which equates to around 3360 thin rashers of back and streaky bacon			0
he could also produce a whopping 54lbs of chops , 72lbs of ham and 32lbs of shoulder			0
master butcher @entity53 , of @entity54 said : ' i reckon you 'd get about 600 good , thick rashers of back bacon from the loin			0
it 's a bloody big pig			0
' proud owner @entity25 , 37 , said : ' @entity3 is exceptionally fertile			2
all the lady pigs dote on him			0
' ' the main problem we have is finding any big enough to avoid getting crushed - but because @entity4 is a beefy pig , she can stomach his weight when they 're rutting			1
@entity4 is @entity3 ' favourite - they 've probably had around 70 piglets together			1
' @entity3 stays in peak physical condition by scoffing four kilos of rolled barley and wheat per day			2
' @entity3 is a huge but healthy pig , ' said mr @entity25 , who runs the show farm with his wife @entity77 , 29			2
' he has n't grown this big by eating scraps or junk			0
his diet is basically a massive amount of muesli every day plus the odd apple for a treat			0
' sausages : the pigs weigh enough together to make more than 10,000 sausages			0
@entity4 , weighs about 670lbs , but four - year - old @entity3 tips the scales at a whopping 925lbs hefty : believe it or not @entity3 has been on a diet over the winter - but he will soon put the bulk back on when he is allowed back into the fields @entity4 is one of eight breeding sows at the farm with whom lucky @entity3 sires a staggering 175 piglets every year - around 600 in total			1
mr @entity25 said @entity3 ' never throws his weight around , ' despite his giant size			2
' he 's the most docile , laid back pig you 'll ever meet and he 'll happily let 100 school children line up and stroke him , ' he said			0
four - year - old @entity3 tips the scales at 925lbs , measures more than 7ft from snout to tail , and is well over 3ft tall			1
@entity4 , aged three , weighs about 670lbs and is 6ft long and 3ft 6ins tall			2
mr @entity25 said : ' @entity3 has been on a bit of a diet over the winter - he 's been inside so he loses weight , but in the summer he 'll put it all back on once he 's out in the fields			1
' if we were n't to restrict his diet , he 'd just get fat , but in the summer , he builds up a lot of muscle			0
i 've heard of pigs that weigh more than 450kg , but i reckon @entity3 is the podgiest porker in @entity12			0
' snuggling : the super-sized pair 's bulk has not got in the way of their breeding			0
@entity3 has sired 175 piglets with the farm 's eight breeding sows large scale : the crossbred pair are far larger and heavier than average - sized pigs			1
@entity3 alone is four times the size of a normal porker @entity25 and @entity77 have grown so attached to @entity3 that he has been saved from the chop			2
their initial aim was to buy a few pigs to fatten up and sell on - but they never expected @entity3 to keep expanding until he was nearly four times heavier than a normal hog			1
local butcher @entity142 reckons @entity3 alone contains enough meat to make 6,250 sausages - but @entity25 says his prize pet will never get the chop			2
he added : ' i remember him as a little piglet			0
it was only the fact that he developed into such a phenomenal size that we thought we would keep him for breeding			0

@entity3 and @entity4 have combined weight of over three quarters of a ton
at 925lbs @entity3 is heavy enough to crush a female during mating
he weighs around six times as much as an average - sized pig
the pair have nevertheless produced dozens of piglets over last two years
