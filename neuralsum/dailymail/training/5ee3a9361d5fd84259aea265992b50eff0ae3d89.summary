by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 9 may 2013 a 72 - year - old amateur gardener has spent three years and £ 20,000 building @entity5 's biggest water - powered cuckoo clock - which is the size of a house			1
@entity7 designed and built the 25ft tall clock , complete with a 3ft wooden cuckoo which pops out every hour and chimes with a huge pipe organ			1
it is powered by a complex system of cantilevers , counterweights and pulleys which convert energy from a passing stream			0
mr @entity7 , who is a retired hydrogeologist used his experience to design and build the wooden structure at his water gardens in @entity22			1
giant achievement : it took a total of three years and about £ 20,000 to complete the unique clock proud owner : 72 - year - old @entity7 masterminded the project , and built most of the 25 - ft tall clock by himself wake - up call : this 3ft painted cuckoo is a scaled - up version of the birds that were designed for the original cuckoo clocks made in @entity36 's @entity35 he said : ' i think it 's quite fun and rather beautiful			1
i wanted to make something that made people laugh			0
' it took a while to build , but i did almost all the work myself			0
' i had a local carpenter and local machinists help me with some of the frame and the metalworking though			0
" mr @entity7 's knowledge of complex water - powered structures comes from a long career spent bringing water to arid farmlands in @entity54 and @entity55			1
he drafted in an organ - maker to help build the complicated mechanism that makes the bird cuckoo			2
the house uses pipes and bellows to create compressed air to pump through a music box , tuned to mimic the call of the bird			0
he said : ' it 's gaining a few minutes every day at the moment			0
' the warmer weather causes the wood to warp slightly and makes the water flow differently through the system of pipes and tanks			0
picturesque : at almost 7m tall the cuckoo clock should be an eyesore			1
but the structure 's quaint design and floral surroundings look like a fairytale scene no need for a watch : @entity7 and his wife @entity82 will only have to glance out of the window to see the time in their back garden sweet sounds : the organ pipes and music box used to generate the distinctive cuckoo call every hour			1
mr @entity7 had help from a specialist organ - maker to build the clock 's mechanism ' but no - one 's setting their watches by it			2
' the clock is one of the attractions at @entity101 , a three - and - a - half acre visitor garden			2
mr @entity7 owns a granite tower with gargoyles modelled after his own head , and an igloo built out of glass bottles			1
his wife @entity82 said : ' three years to build the clock is astonishing			0
i think it 's amazing what @entity7 does , astonishing			2
' mr @entity7 said : ' i 'm going to keep on making them until i ca n't any more , i think			2
it 's something i enjoy very much and it keeps me very busy , and happy			0
' a garden needs some action			0
it 's a great thing for kids to come and see the mechanism - to see how engineering really works			0
' hard graft : mr @entity7 had some help from local carpenters to complete his mammoth project , but did most of the work himself in the running ? : the largest cuckoo clock in the world is said to be in @entity130			1
the world 's biggest free - hanging cuckoo clock is in @entity36			1

72 - year - old @entity7 constructed 25ft cuckoo clock in his back garden
@entity5 's biggest water - powered clock features 3ft tall cuckoo
@entity22 garden also features an igloo made of glass bottles and gargoyles modelled after the owner
