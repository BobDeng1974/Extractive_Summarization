by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 22 october 2013 social media users should compose a ‘ famous last @entity3 ’ to go out after they are dead , according to legal experts			1
although it may sound grim , experts claim the move is only a digital extension of the last requests many people make in a will			2
this advice has been given in a new guide from experts @entity14 which advises people on how to sort out their ' digital legacy			1
' social media users should compose a ' famous last @entity3 ' to go out after they are dead , according to experts and it includes getting @entity22 and @entity3 users to prepare their final messages to go out to friends and followers from beyond the grave			1
that way , the news will go out far beyond immediate family and friends and could prevent accidental but insensitive messages on a social media page such as birthday greetings from those who did not know			1
as well as this , many people have a large online presence that may need to be sorted out once they die , said @entity38 's @entity37			0
this can include online subscriptions to clubs , retailers , websites and money being either paid or owed to the deceased from online betting sites and others			0
@entity49 at @entity50 said : ' in the same way you would not want your loved ones falling out or being inconvenienced over a missing will when you die , it 's also imperative to plan ahead for the great internet cafe in the sky ' millions have accounts with sites like @entity60 and others who would keep sending email offers to the address of the deceased unless the accounts are closed			2
a final tweet can go out far beyond immediate family and friends and could prevent accidental but insensitive messages on a social media page @entity49 , head of wills , probate and lifetime planning at @entity50 said : ‘ being a relatively new invention , there are not yet any substantial legal procedures in place to protect your online presence and even less still when you die			1
‘ in the same way you would not want your loved ones falling out or being inconvenienced over a missing will when you die , it 's also imperative to plan ahead for the great internet cafe in the sky			0
’ the group is advising the public to compile a secure ‘ online directory # , detailing all active internet accounts along with requests for how each should be dealt with			0
‘ given how new an invention the internet is , it 's perhaps not surprising that many people are not yet familiar with the idea of a digital legacy , ’ added ms @entity49			2
‘ yet as we continue to live more and more of our lives online , it 's become increasingly important to start planning for our virtual afterlife when we pass away			0
‘ accounts registered with everything from social media pages , email providers , online retailers and online banking contain sensitive information that should be removed			1
this is especially true where banking information is involved			0
" ‘ with the internet still being somewhat of a legal grey area , we understand the importance of consumers being aware of the risks - emotional , practical and financial - of not properly setting your online affairs in order			0

could prevent accidental but insensitive messages on social media pages
a final tweet may also inform *companies* that a subscriber is now deceased
