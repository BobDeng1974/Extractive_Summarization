@entity7 invited members of the media to the @entity10 in @entity11 to fire off a few rounds at a bust form dressed in the navy pinstripe vest , matching two - button jacket and trousers that they claim can stop a speeding bullet			2
the outfit has been made with several sheets of carbon nano - tubes - a state - of - the - art puncture - proof and bullet - resistant material sourced through a company that provides anti-ballistic gear for the @entity26			2

but what price would you put on your life and looking good ? ' after receiving requests from high - profile clients who travel to dangerous places for work , we set out to develop a lightweight , fashion - forward bulletproof suit as a more discreet and stylish alternative to wearing a bulky vest underneath , ' @entity69 , co-owner and bespoke tailor of @entity7 told @entity79			1
perhaps the bigger question is , though , how badly do you want to tell your friends that you own a bulletproof suit ? mr @entity83 likened some of the clients who have ordered a @entity7 in bulletproof to guys that buy sports cars which never leave the garage			2
' they may never wear the suit , but they still want to own one , ' he said			0

@entity69 , co-owner of @entity7 tailors , points out bullet holes on a bulletproof suit made by the company after it was shot at from a handgun ' they could dress in casual clothes to not stand out , but they wear suits to make a good impression and be taken seriously			1
' it only makes sense that they should have access to one that will make them look professional , but also feel safe			0
' @entity160 , ceo of @entity161 , an electronic - payments provider serving e-commerce companies worldwide , was one person considering buying one of the new suits following the demonstration			0
' i ’m married with three children , so i ’m always concerned about getting home [ from work trips ] safely , ' he said			0
the nano - tube fibers used as the bulletproof technology were so strong during the making of the suit they had to be cut with a ban saw			0
here a tailor shows how pieces were cut using fabric stencils so they could be easily slipped into the lining of a regular suit mr @entity160 does not travel with security and will travel to @entity183 and @entity184 on business in the coming months			0
' i do n’t like the idea of wearing a heavy bulletproof vest , but a jacket that fits like a glove and is made with military - grade material that ’s stronger than @entity28 – why not ? ' he said			1
