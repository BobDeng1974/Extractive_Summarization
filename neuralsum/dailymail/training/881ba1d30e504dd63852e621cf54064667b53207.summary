‘ i ’ve got a puppy and a two - year - old stepdaughter and we ’ve looked everywhere , ’ said the 22 - year - old , from @entity13 in @entity14			1
@entity1 in @entity13 ( pictured ) , @entity14 , have been warned a missing python may be hiding in a coat sleeve ‘ they turn up in the strangest of places , like the arm of a coat			1
but i ca n’t find her anywhere			2
’ @entity8 – named because it has lost an eye – was safe in its tank last tuesday when its owner gave it a mouse to eat			1
but when @entity29 returned a little later , she found the mouse untouched and the snake missing			1
she said she would usually be confident of finding the three - year - old pet in the house , but the doors had been left open because of the hot weather			2

when she ’s fully grown she ’ll be around six foot long			0
‘ we ’re starting to panic a bit			0
in the winter they go for the heat but it ’s so warm she could have gone anywhere			0
i put another mouse in the tank in the hope that she would come back but she did n’t			2
‘ if she ’s found i ’d ask people not to touch her			0
if they ’re brave they can put her in a pillow case			0

adults typically eat animals equivalent to the size of a domestic cat but some larger species have been known to devour adult deer			0
an @entity85 spokesman said : ‘ we would advise anyone who finds a stray captive snake to contact our cruelty and advice line			0
