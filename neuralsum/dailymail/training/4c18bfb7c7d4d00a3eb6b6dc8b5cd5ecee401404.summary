identical twins have appeared in court charged with the rape of the same woman			1
@entity4 and @entity5 were arrested after dna evidence allegedly linked one – or both – of them to the crime			1
prosecutors will almost certainly need to use other evidence to build their case			2
accused : the pair of identical twins , aged 22 , have appeared in court charged with rape identical twins have matching dna , according to the @entity17 , so a case based solely on such evidence may well fail because prosecutors would be unable to isolate who was responsible for the alleged rape			1
@entity23 and the @entity24 are still trying to determine whether they should continue to pursue the case against both men			0
the twins , 22 , appeared at a preliminary hearing at @entity29 on tuesday when prosecutor @entity30 requested more time for the @entity24 to pursue lines of inquiry			2
she said : ‘ it is an unusual case			0
twins : prosecutors have charged @entity4 ( left ) and @entity38 ( right ) @entity5 as @entity16 ca n't tell them apart identical ( monozygotic ) twins happen when a single egg ( zygote ) is fertilised			1
the egg then divides into two embryos , creating identical twins who share the same genes as one another			1
since monozygotic twins come from the same fertilized egg , they have the exact same dna			2
identical twins are always the same sex and blood type			1
identical twins do not run in families , contrary to popular myth			1
source : @entity53 ' there is further work due and there is an indication which would tend to support that one was not at the location			0
‘ it may mean that only one of the defendants faces trial			0
’ no details were divulged about the circumstances of the alleged offence of november 5 , 2011			0
neither defendant entered a plea and both were granted bail			0
the brothers , from @entity72 , are expected to face a trial on december 2			0
identical twins have the same dna because they originate from the same egg , which divides into two embryos after it is fertilised			1
they are always the same sex and have the same blood type – though their fingerprints will differ			0
twins who are not identical do not carry the same dna			2

identical twins @entity4 and @entity5 , 22 , both charged with rape
dna evidence linked the alleged crime with one **-** or both **-** of them
