@entity1 's twin daughters @entity2 and @entity3 were born at 37 weeks after surviving a rare condition which meant they shared a placenta in the womb at 18 weeks pregnant , @entity1 faced a terrifying decision			1
when doctors diagnosed her unborn twins with a rare condition they offered pioneering surgery to increase their chances of survival			1
the babies shared the same placenta , but an unequal blood supply meant one or both of the twins was unlikely to survive			1
the radical operation , which involved surgeons separating the girls using laser technology , gave the twins a 45 per cent chance of surviving to full term			2
doctors inserted a camera and fibre optic laser down a tiny endoscope into mrs @entity1 's womb			1
the laser then sealed off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the girls received a more equal supply of blood			1
just hours after the surgery , doctors feared the worst when at 19 weeks mrs @entity1 's waters broke			1
but remarkably the amniotic sacs re-sealed and the twins were born healthy at 37 weeks			1
the stay - at - home mother from @entity44 in @entity45 , said she now treasures every moment with her twin daughters			1
the mother - of - four said : ' there was no doubt in my mind i wanted the surgery			0
' i wanted to go through with it and give them both the best chance at life			0
' i did n't care if they came out with mental or physical problems , i just wanted them alive			0
' when they were born i was over the moon			0
they are just marvellous , i treasure every moment with them			0
' mrs @entity1 unexpectedly discovered she was pregnant at seven weeks			2
it was at an 18 - week scan at @entity68 in @entity69 that medics detected the abnormality			0
the condition is known as twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome , and results in one baby receiving an inadequate blood supply			1
mrs @entity1 , said : ' we were told that one of the babies was vacuumed in its sac			1
' the consultant explained that one of the twins had about 12cm worth of fluid and the other baby just had 0.4cm , because of this she could n't move her arms and legs at all			0
' that 's when he gave me a couple of options , he suggested that perhaps i should consider termination , or the laser surgery			2
' i was so upset , i was just crying and all these emotions were just running through me			0
' mrs @entity1 was then referred to the @entity96 at @entity97 in @entity98 and underwent surgery three days later			1
she was able to watch the whole procedure on a screen , due to the fact she was only under a local anesthetic			0
at an 18 - week scan doctors diagnosed the condition twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome			1
they told @entity108 radical surgery to separate her unborn babies could give them a 45 per cent chance of surviving to full term mrs @entity1 , pictured with the twins , her husband @entity112 and their older children @entity113 and @entity116 , said she immediately opted for the surgery			1
doctors used a laser to seal off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the girls received a more equal supply of blood despite its success , the mother - of - four and her partner @entity126 , 29 , were left on tenterhooks after being warned that they were still not out of danger			1
mrs @entity1 was warned that she had a high chance of a miscarriage during the following six weeks			2
twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome is a disease of the placenta			1
the condition only affects identical twins , who share a placenta			1
the condition causes the placenta to contain abnormal blood vessels , which connect to the umbilical cords and circulations of the twins			1
in many cases the common placenta is shared unequally by the twins , and one may have a share too small to provide the necessary nutrients to grow or even survive			2
she said : ' they said the first two weeks would be the worst			0
the doctors warned that it was likely one or both of the babies would be disabled or ill. ' when i came out of surgery i felt so relieved because they told me the surgery had gone much better than expected			2
' when i got home i could feel the babies kicking away so i was really @entity161 belly had got so big - i suddenly looked like i was 30 weeks pregnant			0
' just hours after returning home from the procedure her waters broke , despite being just 19 weeks pregnant			2
a test confirmed that the amniotic sacs had ruptured , but miraculously they were able to re-seal themselves			2
in spite of the scare the twins were born healthy on september 24 , 2013 at @entity171 in @entity45 , with @entity172 weighing 5lbs and her sister , @entity3 , weighed in at 5lbs 12oz			2
mrs @entity1 , who also has daughter @entity113 , six , and son , @entity116 , three , said that after the traumatic start to life she values every minute with the girls			1
she said : ' then my waters broke , i was only 19 weeks gone			0
but just hours after the pioneering operation , doctors feared the worst when mrs @entity1 's waters broke when she was just 19 weeks pregnant			1
but remarkably the amniotic sacs repaired themselves @entity2 and @entity3 were born at 37 weeks			2
their mother said : ' it was such a relief to finally get them both home			0
they are miracles , they are perfect ' ' i was rushed to hospital where i was told that the babies were still alive			0
' the following morning they did a scan and the doctors told me they were n't expecting to find a heartbeat			0
' i did n't believe them though as i could still feel them kicking and i was adamant they would be ok			0
' i had the scan and it was an absolute miracle - the sac had refilled and sealed itself			0
' i was trying to keep my legs crossed , as then i was thinking that they just could n't come out but after that the pregnancy was just smooth sailing			0
' it was such a relief to finally get them both home			0
they are miracles , they are perfect			0
