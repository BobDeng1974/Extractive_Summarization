by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 20 june 2013 @entity1 may look every inch the beauty queen , but unlike her fellow contestants , @entity1 was born a boy			1
the 21 - year - old was born @entity7 , and , over the past three years , has been making the transition to become a woman			1
now @entity1 , who has been taking female hormones and dressing as a woman since she was 18 is competing to be crowned miss @entity12 2013			1
@entity1 , left , was born @entity7 , right , and began her full transition to become a women three years ago @entity1 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , is now competing alongside 11 other contestants in the beauty pageant which takes place in @entity21 on saturday			1
for just three years ago , @entity1 was a man called @entity7 , it was n't until she was 18 that she made the decision to leave her life as a man behind and embrace life as a woman			1
but @entity1 , a manager at a nightclub in @entity30 , admits that while she did n't leave her male life behind until she was 18 , the transition from man to woman began at an early age			1
@entity1 , who has already been crowned @entity36 ( right ) , hopes to be crowned miss @entity12 2013 , and to inspire others who are transgender to express themselves freely she said : ' for me the transition to a woman was a gradual process , i grew up playing with girls ' toys , i started wearing make - up when i was 11 and i told my parents i was gay when i had my first boyfriend aged 12			1
' when i was three , my mum brought me a pram , i 'd always liked girls ' toys and i was never interested in sport , @entity53 or anything like that , it never seemed natural to me			0
' i think the first time i realised i was different from other boys was when i was around eight years old			0
' i 'd been invited to a boy 's birthday party and all the other boys at the party spent the afternoon playing football in the garden together , while i stayed inside and played with his dog			0
although @entity1 did n't leave her male life behind until she was 18 , the transition from man to woman began at an early age , and she began wearing make - up at 11 ' there was always a part of me that knew i was different to other boys my age but it was never an issue			1
' i never felt like i was trapped because my family were very accepting , i had the freedom to be myself			0
' when i was 16 i left school and became a make - up artist , where i started experimenting more with make - up , i gradually wore more and more until i no longer left the house without it			2
' around 17 i started growing my hair , had hair extensions and began dressing like a woman			1
' but even though i wore women 's clothes and make - up everyday i still identified myself as a man			2
left , @entity1 says growing up as a boy she was never interested in toys aimed at men			2
right , as a teenager @entity1 began dressing as a girl ' when i was 18 i moved to @entity93 where i lived until january this year			1
it was then , when i was 18 , i just realised i was no longer wearing make - up , growing my hair or dressing like a female for any other reason than i felt more comfortable that way			1
' @entity1 visited a doctor in @entity93 who prescribed her with female hormones , she changed her name from @entity7 to @entity1 , began her life as a woman and has n't looked back since			1
unlike many people diagnosed as transgender , @entity1 said she did n't face the same gender struggle , she did n't feel like a girl trapped in a boy 's body as she was never forced to identify with one gender			2
aged 18 @entity1 visited a doctor in @entity93 who prescribed her with female hormones			1
it was then that she changed her name from @entity7 to @entity117 and began in earnest her life as a woman @entity1 was encouraged by her mother @entity120 to act and do whatever made her happy regardless of whether her behaviour was considered characteristically male or female			1
and @entity1 said it was the support of her family which enabled her to be confident in her her own skin			2
' becoming a woman has never been an issue as my family have always been extremely supportive			0
' i never had any drama surrounding my gender , i was accepted for who i was and i never felt as though i was trapped because i was always free to dress and act as i pleased			0
' i was never bullied for wearing make - up probably because i was confident and happy in my own skin			1
' i told my mum that i was taking female hormones when i was 18 and it was n't a big deal because i 'd already been wearing make - up and dressing like a female , hormones were the next natural step			1
' i keep a photo of myself as @entity7 in my purse , it makes me feel proud to see how far i 've come			2
@entity1 says it was the support of her family which enabled her to be confident in her her own skin ' at the moment i 'm focusing on laser hair removal			2
there are lots of ways i could enhance my appearance as a woman but at the moment i 'm happy with the way i look			0
' i do n't hide the fact i 'm transgender but i 'd prefer to be identified as a woman , i take offence if people notice			2
' i 'm lucky that i have quite feminine features , so most people never guess i 'm transgender			0
" there are many people who go through with the sex change and i 'd never say never but i ca n't see it in my future			0
i do n't feel like i need to have it to be myself			0
' @entity1 said taking part in the beauty pageant was not only a big step for her but an opportunity to inspire others			1
' if i 'd continued my life as a gay man i would n't have the life i have now			0
' she said she hoped the pageant would help dispel stereotypes and encourage other transgender people to have the courage to live and act how they feel most comfortable			0
she said : ' if someone had told me three or four years ago i 'd be competing in a beauty pageant i 'd never have believed them			1
' but the closer we get to the event the more i realise how important this could be , how acting as a face for transgender could help so many people			0
' i get so many message from people , mainly young boys who want tips on how to look more feminine , or some from men older than me asking for advice			0
' i feel very lucky , some people have had to hide it their whole life , some men have even been married with children before they 've decided to live their life as a woman			0
' i take a lot of pride in the fact i was never scared , of course there were awkward moments but because i was confident in myself i was never bullied at school and i was always accepted for how i was			0
' taking part in the beauty pageant is a big deal , i want to help others and inspire them to have the courage to live as they want to			2
' i am very proud of who i am and i 'm happy to discuss it , i feel lucky because what i am has propelled me into a life i never would have dreamed of			0
' if i 'd continued my life as a gay man i would n't have the life i have now			0
