@entity0 barked one last piece of advice for his @entity4 players as they pulled into the @entity5 for their @entity7 second round tie on sunday			1
' this is no day out , ' he growled			0
' and anyone who thinks that can stay on the f * * * ing coach			0
' the @entity15 ground may be better - known for athletics than football – local boy @entity18 famously broke a world record there – but it could have been @entity21 for the gardeners , plasterers and pizza delivery drivers who made up the @entity4 team			1
manager @entity0 , younger brother of @entity58 and @entity60 star @entity59 , does n't mind being considered old school			0
over team breakfast at the @entity63 in @entity64 on sunday morning , he mused that the trappings might make his team soft			2
' you need hunger to win			0
it 's all about this , ' beating his chest as he sat down for his scrambled eggs and toast			2
@entity0 and @entity4 , who became national heroes by beating @entity76 @entity75 in the first round , kindly granted @entity79 access all areas for their big day			1
@entity4 's part - time players have breakfast at their team hotel ahead of the biggest match in the club 's history @entity87 , who play in the @entity88 , have never advanced this far in the @entity7 the @entity4 squad inspect the pitch at the @entity5 in the run - up to kick - off it 's a little bit crowded in the away dressing room as the @entity4 squad get themselves ready for the second round tie more than a thousand @entity98 fans , four times their average home gate , had travelled the 160 miles north , which was as cold and windy as you 'd expect approaching @entity101			1
if those supporters had heard @entity0 and his coach @entity103 in the dressing - room beforehand , they would have put on boots themselves and prepared to run through brick walls			2
' help your mates out there			0
there will be mistakes and when they happen , help each other			0
i believe in you , ' implored @entity0			0
' go and make history , ' shouted @entity103 , who had the unenviable task of reading out the chosen team line - up in the dressing - room an hour before kick off			0
manager @entity0 issues his final rallying cry in the changing room before the players head out for the match @entity0 fires up his players , who started the afternoon just 90 minutes away from a possible tie with the likes of @entity129 or @entity130 kitted out and ready for action , @entity4 's players psych one another up ahead of the match the visitors assemble into a huddle for one final team talk before the match gets underway at @entity5 the @entity4 team step out over the athletics track and onto the pitch at the @entity5 the two teams join together for a group photograph to commemorate 100 years since the @entity101 truce during the @entity142 @entity4 fans strip off to show their support at the @entity5 and even have a home - made tinfoil @entity7 some of the 1,000 - plus @entity4 supporters who made their way to the north - east for sunday 's second round @entity7 tie the @entity4 fans create a colourful display with blue and yellow smoke flares at the @entity5 the pair went through some cup battles as team - mates at @entity157 including one infamous @entity159 tie against @entity160 when @entity0 responded to being bitten on the arm by @entity162 , by biting him on the neck			1
it was a family affair too			0
chairman @entity166 's wife and two young children travelled with him to the stadium on the players ' team coach although @entity0 ushered them off on arrival before he embarked on a motivational speech he knew would contain swear words			2
@entity174 , brother of @entity176 manager @entity175 , was blessed at the team hotel by his nine - year - old daughter and 20 members of the @entity0 family travelled together to the game from @entity182			0
unfortunately in football , there is always an opponent to upset best - laid plans			2
@entity187 started like a side operating three divisions higher than @entity4			1
with 35 - year - old former @entity58 and @entity192 international @entity191 pulling the strings , they took the lead after eight minutes through former @entity196 striker @entity195			1
and it was only grim determination from @entity4 , allied to saves by goalkeeper @entity199 and two @entity5 attempts that hit the woodwork that kept the game close			1
@entity5 's @entity195 celebrates his eighth - minute goal to put the @entity15 side in front @entity5 's @entity206 slides in on @entity4 's @entity207 as the visitors try to launch at attack @entity210 of @entity5 puts out a hand to stop @entity4 's @entity212 reaching the ball near the byline @entity5 scorer @entity195 shields the ball from @entity4 's @entity216 during the first half the action unfolds during the first half at the @entity5 as the teams try to advance to the @entity7 third round @entity0 bellows out instructions during the match , which @entity4 ultimately lost 2 - 0 @entity210 of @entity5 heads clear under pressure from the @entity4 forward line as they mount pressure @entity4 no 10 @entity227 rues a missed chance on goal as the visitors tried to fight their way back into contention as @entity0 rallied the troops at half - time , @entity166 and the other directors took stock over a cup of coffee			1
' you can see the benefits of being full - time , ' said board member @entity241			2
@entity4 's players earn around £ 70 - a - week from football			1
but the @entity245 minnows , the lowest - ranked side left in the competition , did themselves proud after half - time in front of the @entity251 cameras			1
@entity252 went close to an equaliser and substitute @entity254 was denied a strong penalty appeal			0
@entity252 is arguably @entity4 's best player but has an attitude that needs work			1
' i tried to sign him for 14 months but he did n't want to leave @entity260 because they were near his house , ' said @entity0 , before smiling ' but i got him in the end			0
' a late second goal from @entity264 after a mis - kick by @entity199 sealed @entity5 's win as the form book demanded			1
@entity0 tried to gee his players up afterwards			0
' we have to go again and win the league , ' he said			0
' you are good players			0
' @entity264 celebrates scoring @entity187 's second goal in stoppage time at the end of the game @entity0 reacts after @entity264 scores a late second for @entity5 , confirming @entity4 's exit from the competition the @entity4 players applaud their 1,000 plus travelling fans at the final whistle after @entity5 beat them 2 - 0 in the @entity7 @entity87 , who rank three divisions and 79 places beneath their opponents , salute their fans at the end @entity174 , who was @entity4 's first round hero against @entity75 , kisses his daughter after the final whistle @entity174 applauds the travelling fans as he reflects on the end of @entity4 's long @entity7 adventure then his real feelings were revealed as he turned the corner and aggressively swiped a jug of water off a nearby table and covered the floor			1
on monday it will be @entity5 , managed by former @entity300 @entity299 winner , who will be alongside @entity130 and @entity129 in the @entity7 third round draw			1
but @entity4 wo n't be forgotten in a hurry after their amazing nine - match run in the competition			2
they have earned nearly £ 200,000 from this season 's @entity7 – equivalent to five years ' revenue in normal times - and have ended the notion that @entity4 is exclusively a rugby town			1
but now , in time - honoured tradition , they have to concentrate on the league			2
next up on tuesday night are @entity312 .			0

@entity5 beat @entity4 2 - 0 to book their place in the @entity7 third round on sunday afternoon
the @entity15 side led when @entity195 fired home @entity319 's cut - back on eight minutes
but it took them until stoppage time to kill off @entity4 's spirited *challenge* when @entity264 scored
three divisions and 79 places separated the two opponents at the @entity5
@entity88 side @entity4 caused a sensation by beating @entity75 in first round
over 1,000 fans - four times their usual *attendance* - made the 160 - mile journey with them to the north - east
@entity4 's players include gardeners , plasterers and pizza delivery drivers and earn £ 70 a week from football
