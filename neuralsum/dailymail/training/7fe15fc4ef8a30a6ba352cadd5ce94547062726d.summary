by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 07:41 est , 21 april 2013 must - see : @entity2 's naked man image in @entity3 is on @entity5 's 101 things to do in @entity6 from eating a sizzling balti in @entity9 , to enjoying a night on the ' toon ' in @entity11 or looking at @entity2 's image of a naked man hanging from a @entity3 window ledge , there is no better way to celebrate the best of @entity6 , according to tourism bosses			1
these and other suggestions are included on @entity5 's ' bucket list ' of experiences to enjoy on these shores , before heading abroad for the summer			1
the full list of 101 things to do in @entity6 will be revealed on tuesday in time for @entity24			1
unsurprisingly , @entity25 , the @entity26 and @entity27 have made it onto the list , but so too have a host of unusual suggestions for the more adventurous tourist			1
these include swinging through the @entity35 pines at @entity36 in @entity37 , and searching for bats in the caves at @entity40 in @entity41			1
@entity42 , actor , bird - watcher and former presenter of @entity46 ’s @entity45 and @entity45 , selected the @entity47 in @entity48 for the list			1
he said : ' there are just a few places that i would recommend to anyone and feel absolutely confident that they would have an unforgettable experience			1
' the @entity47 in @entity48 is – or are – one of them			1
' i ’d recommend april to early september , with june and july for maximum bird activity			1
i have visited sea bird colonies all round the world and believe me the @entity61 are the best place to literally walk amongst terns , shags , kittiwakes and the photogenic and endlessly entertaining puffins			1
' as old as time : @entity25 in @entity68 has made it onto the ' bucket list ' of 101 things to do from @entity5 legendary : @entity73 in @entity74 , the mythical home of @entity76 mouthwatering : enjoy fresh oysters at @entity78 , @entity79 meanwhile presenter @entity80 opted for coasteering in @entity74 : ' i 've chosen coasteering in @entity74 as my ultimate pick , because it sounds like a super-charged version of something many of us will have tried as kids on a seaside holiday			1
' the variety of activity – the sport involves swimming , jumping , diving , climbing and scrambling – would make it a totally adrenaline - packed experience , but you can also push yourself only as far as you want to			1
' it 's a unique way of exploring one of @entity6 's most stunning coastlines			1
' have a cuppa : tea at @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 is one of the must - do activities on the list aside from exploring @entity6 's diverse wildlife and nature , tourists can also experience the country 's finest food and drink			1
tourist bosses suggest eating fish and chips on the beach at @entity117 in @entity118 , tucking into a ' proper ' @entity119 in @entity120 , or for the quintessential experience , having a truly @entity6 cuppa at the country 's only tea estate in @entity125 , @entity74			1
@entity127 - starred chef @entity126 , who selected oysters for the list , said : ' eating oysters in @entity78 has to be a favourite of mine			1
i love oysters , they really are one of my favourite treats , and growing up i remember reading books that @entity78 featured in			1
so i think the combination of the two , a food i really love to eat and a town i read about thousands of miles away , makes this a special choice for me			1
' dress to impress : tourists can enjoy a day out at @entity144 , @entity145			1
meanwhile claymation favourites @entity146 and @entity146 asked for the finest example of @entity6 eccentricity to be added to the list - cheese rolling in the @entity151			1
