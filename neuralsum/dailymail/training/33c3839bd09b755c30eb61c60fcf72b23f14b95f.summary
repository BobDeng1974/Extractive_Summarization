' instead of the call she was expecting , however , she got a text and it was not from a protester , it was from one of the police officers who had been standing in the police line opposite her			1
@entity14 did not want to reveal his full name for fear of losing his job , but told her he wanted to marry her			1
he said that when he had seen her standing there defenceless and putting herself between armed men and those that she was trying to protect , he had been smitten			2
@entity14 had been even more impressed when the police line had actually turned round and moved away			1
the short message said : ' despite all the commotion i remembered your phone number when you gave it to your friend			1
i do n't even know your name			2
' i was standing in the night with a shield in front of you			0

she said : ' i was really surprised that the message and do n't know why i agreed to meet him , i thought perhaps it might be possible to convince him that the side he was on was wrong and i certainly did n't expect to find myself falling in love with him			1
but when i saw him when i started to speak to him - that is what happened			0
' but the young woman 's standing went even further when she was invited onto a local television station called @entity118 to talk about her love affair with the police officer from the other side			1

she got a standing ovation from the audience , and said : ' you probably want to hear a story from me about how with my bare hands i restrained a whole riot unit , and how one of the officers fell in love with me , and i fell in love with him			1
' it is true that i fell in love with the policeman that i met , but i 'm going to tell you another story			1

' yes , you have the right to try to clear your conscience , but i think if you really want to show how sorry you are you should run this program on your knees			0
