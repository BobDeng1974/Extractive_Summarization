this @entity1 setter , named @entity2 , is feared to have been murdered at the @entity4 dog competition the world of dog breeding was rocked by scandal last night amid allegations that a prize - winner at this year 's @entity4 was deliberately poisoned			1
in a plot straight from the pages of a detective drama , a breeder claimed her £ 50,000 @entity1 setter died after he was fed meat laced with toxins			1
but she believes the poisoner mistakenly targeted the wrong dog and had intended to kill another of her @entity1 setters that looks very similar			1
in what could become the biggest scandal in @entity4 ' 124 - year history , three - year - old @entity2 collapsed and died on friday , the day after coming second in his class at the world 's most famous dog show			1
tests found that @entity2 – pedigree name @entity30 – had eaten cubed beef laced with up to three poisons			1
however co-owner @entity34 believes the intended victim was four - year - old noodle , pedigree name @entity36 , who won best of breed on the day @entity2 competed			1
the two almost identical looking dogs had switched places on the benches where entrants sit before and after going in the show ring at the @entity44 in @entity45			1
@entity2 died in the arms of joint owner @entity47 at her home in @entity49			1
she reported his death to police and animal welfare officials there , and to the @entity53 , which runs @entity4			2
@entity55 footage from the @entity44 is being reviewed but @entity56 and the @entity57 here have yet to be informed officially			0
the target ? noodle , pedigree name @entity36 , at @entity4 with co-owner @entity34 - @entity34 there has been controversy over the increasing number of foreign dogs allowed to compete at @entity4 , which attracts more than 20,000 entries from 200 breeds			1
this year 's competition ended last night with @entity70 , a foreign - owned @entity72 terrier , being named best in show			1
but @entity2 's owners say he could have been fed the poisoned meat by a ' random psychopathic dog hater ' or a jealous rival breeder			1
the @entity53 said it had not heard of such an incident before and promised to assist any police inquiries			0
last night mrs @entity34 , 56 , said she had ' done nothing but cry ' over @entity2 's death			2
she said : ' we think this is the work of some random psychopathic dog hater who decided to visit @entity4 with one thing in mind , rather than any sort of targeted attack			1
' mrs @entity34 , who breeds and shows @entity92 hounds and @entity1 setters with her husband @entity94 , 66 , said tests showed @entity2 had been killed by a ' pesticide - type ' poison			1
she said : ' some sadistic person out there poisoned our dog			0
@entity4 is a high - profile event and we live in a very anti-dog society			1
' the holding area where dogs are ' benched ' before and after competing is open to the public , although they are asked not to touch the animals			0
in what could become the biggest scandal in @entity4 ' 124 - year history , three - year - old @entity2 collapsed and died on friday , the day after coming second in his class at the world 's most famous dog show @entity114 posted a message on @entity116 about the incident after it was confirmed that a dog had died she plans to inform @entity56 of the circumstances surrounding @entity2 's death when she receives the written toxicology report later this week			1
mrs @entity34 said she had heard of rumours of skullduggery involving other breeders at shows but had not come across anything like this in 30 years of competing			0
' i do n't believe it had anything to do with other competitors , ' she said			0
' we have had so many calls [ from other breeders who were at the show ] ... everybody has been pulling together and offering support			0
' she is convinced @entity2 was fed poisoned meat when he was on the bench on one of the handful of occasions he was left on his own for up to 15 minutes – the only times he was unattended			2
she is unsure if that was before or after he entered the show ring			0
she told @entity147 's website that nothing appeared untoward until both dogs returned to her home in @entity151 , @entity152 , after competing on the first day of the show on thursday			1
' all the dogs were all running and playing together and @entity2 seemed a bit tired , unable to keep up with the others , ' she said			1
' three or four hours later , after getting back to @entity49 , he collapsed and by the time the vet arrived he was dead			1
the post-mortem showed that two or three different poisons were used and that it is likely it was administered on thursday morning			0
' we 're now waiting for exact toxicology reports			0
whoever did this knew what they were doing , trying to get exactly the right type of poison with a slow release			0
' the animal had won second in his class when he was at @entity4 and his owner think he was poisoned there the dogs had changed places on the bench after one became agitated about being near a bitch in season , it is understood			1
in another twist , mrs @entity34 said the best of breed and challenge certificates won by @entity36 had mysteriously been taken from the benches at some point			0
' and at @entity188 last year someone let one of my dogs off its bench and he went missing , before being found on someone else 's bench , ' she added			1
' it 's been suggested that someone 's really got it in for us , and to not let it get to us			0
there do seem to be too many coincidences			0
' mrs @entity34 , whose setters were named @entity36 after her kennels , which has a worldwide reputation for breeding champion show dogs , added : ' it 's turning into such a nasty sport			2
i went back to @entity4 on saturday but i was like a zombie – i just thought , ' i do n't want to do this any more '			2
' a post on her @entity215 page outlined the death of ' our beautiful boy ' @entity2 and warned other competitors not to leave their dogs unattended at @entity4			1
at her home in @entity224 , near @entity225 , mrs @entity47 , 34 , a full - time breeder who takes her dogs to see the elderly in residential homes , said : ' they have not only taken away a dog , or merely a pet , they have taken away a family member			1
' it should be a hobby and nothing more			0
to think he may have been poisoned by a rival at a dog show just makes it even harder to take			2
' how people can resort to killing a helpless animal from jealousy or hate for a dog in a competition is too much to comprehend			0
i know people take it seriously but if you want to target me , smash my windows or something – do n't go and kill my pet dog			0
