@entity1 's quest for a domestic treble remains firmly on course after an impressive 2 - 0 win over @entity5 in their @entity7 fifth - round tie at @entity8			1
striker @entity9 headed the @entity10 into the lead in the seventh minute with his third goal in four games and the home side were only still in the tie at the interval thanks to keeper @entity17			2
the @entity19 leaders , who face @entity20 in next month 's @entity22 final at @entity23 , doubled their lead through midfielder @entity25 at the start of the second half			2
@entity1 striker @entity9 loses his man to score a header and give his side the lead against @entity5 @entity5 's @entity33 ( left ) challenges @entity1 winger @entity34 ( right ) for the ball at @entity8 @entity5 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity17 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity33 , @entity39 ( @entity40 36 ' ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 ' ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 58 ' ) subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 booked : @entity33 @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 55 ' ) , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 74 ' ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , commons ( @entity64 45 ' ) , @entity25 , @entity9 subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 booked : @entity64 45 ' scorers : @entity9 7 ' , @entity71 ' ref : @entity72 attendance : 7,525 @entity75 's side , who went into the match unbeaten in their last six outings , struggled to live with the ferocious tempo set at times by the @entity10 , especially in the first half , and could not find a way back into the match as the @entity84 side ultimately cruised into the quarter - finals			1
and on this form @entity1 might just fancy their chances in the upcoming @entity89 last - 32 tie against struggling @entity91 outfit @entity90			2
they will be boosted for those matches by new signings from @entity20 , @entity94 and @entity95 , who were cup - tied against the @entity96 on saturday			0
manager @entity97 made only one change , bringing in wideman @entity59 for @entity64 , who started on the bench			0
@entity75 , whose new signings @entity100 and @entity102 were cup - tied from their time at @entity105 , made three changes as @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity46 came in for @entity100 , the injured @entity107 and @entity47 , who dropped to the bench			0
the game was still settling down when midfielder @entity62 picked out over-lapping right - back @entity110 wide on the right and when he curled his cross into the middle @entity114 reacted quickest at the near post to glance a head past @entity17			0
@entity10 goalkeeper @entity53 pulls off a low save to his right from @entity5 striker @entity44 it was a great start for @entity97 's side who moved forward with some pace and purpose in the search for a second			2
in the 23rd minute , after skipper @entity61 had a decent effort from inside the box deflected behind for a fruitless corner , @entity59 should have doubled @entity1 's lead			0
the @entity130 winger robbed @entity5 skipper @entity131 in his own half and after playing a one - two with @entity25 he found himself through on goal with only @entity17 to beat but the keeper blocked and the ball was scrambled to safety			1
the @entity138 keeper made further close - range saves from @entity9 and @entity25 as @entity1 swarmed around the opposition penalty area			1
@entity1 captain @entity61 ( left ) tussles with @entity5 's @entity44 ( right ) during the @entity7 fifth - round for their part @entity5 , who had to reshuffle when @entity39 limped off to be replaced by @entity40 , brother of team - mate @entity43 , had only two real efforts			1
a snap - shot from defender @entity37 from the edge of the @entity1 box whizzed past the post and just before the break , @entity10 keeper @entity53 clawed away a deflected shot from former @entity84 midfielder @entity41			1
@entity34 was replaced by @entity64 for the start of the second half and one of the first things the @entity155 had to do was congratulate @entity25			0
a deep cross from @entity54 found @entity9 unmarked at the back post and when his header was parried by @entity159 , the on - rushing @entity25 fired the ball into the net			1
as the mood among some of the home fans momentarily turned ugly , @entity110 hobbled off to be replaced by @entity55 before @entity64 was booked for simulation			0
@entity47 was brought on for @entity166 but there looked no way back for @entity5			0
on the hour - mark @entity25 curled in a cross from the right which a stretching @entity159 palmed on to the woodwork , relieved to see the ball stay out			2
@entity64 and @entity173 had efforts either side of @entity60 replacing @entity59 and the match was controlled by the visitors all the way to the final whistle			0
@entity1 forward @entity25 scores with a rebounded shot to put his side 2 - 0 up against @entity5 @entity1 are also through to the @entity182 and are currently top of the @entity183			1

@entity1 are through to the @entity7 sixth - round after beating @entity5
@entity9 and @entity25 scored to seal a 2 - 0 *victory*
the @entity10 could *potentially* win a domestic treble this season
