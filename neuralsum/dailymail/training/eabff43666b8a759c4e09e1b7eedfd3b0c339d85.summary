@entity1 could send military reinforcements to the @entity3 if the dispute with @entity5 escalates , the @entity0 has revealed			1
@entity6 said the decision to send @entity8 as part of an international flotilla of warships through the sensitive @entity12 on sunday sent a ' clear signal ' to @entity14			1
and he warned that reinforcements will be available if needed			0
@entity5 has threatened to close the strait - through which 35 per cent of the world 's tanker - borne oil exports pass - in retaliation for sanctions against its oil exports			1
the news comes after prime minister @entity24 last night said @entity1 ' will not accept ' @entity5 's bid to develop a nuclear weapon			1
flotilla : the @entity28 @entity29 ( left ) , takes over from the @entity30 in the @entity31			0
the @entity29 later led the convoy through the @entity12 @entity1 warship : @entity8 , the type 23 frigate , which joined the @entity36 vessels ( file photo ) mr @entity6 was speaking at a press conference in @entity39 following the annual round of talks between @entity1 and @entity44 foreign and defence ministers			1
@entity44 's foreign minister @entity45 said his country would enforce the same ban on @entity5 crude oil exports agreed by the @entity49 yesterday			2
he and defence minister @entity50 will attend today 's @entity52 meeting			0
it follows yesterday 's rare joint statement where @entity56 chancellor @entity55 , @entity58 president @entity57 and mr @entity24 warned @entity14 it would face economic isolation unless it abandoned its nuclear ambitions ' immediately '			1
they added : ' we have no quarrel with the @entity5 people			0
but the @entity5 leadership has failed to restore international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme			2
we will not accept @entity5 acquiring a nuclear weapon			0
' the statement , which concluded a day of intense activity , was backed up by an ' unprecedented ' package of @entity49 sanctions , designed to suck the lifeblood from the regime – including the ban on importing @entity5 oil into @entity79			1
@entity14 responded with defiance , with elements of the ruling regime warning it would shut the strategically critical @entity12 – a move that would effectively close the @entity3 to shipping and send oil prices rocketing			1
under pressure : @entity30 ( @entity87 ) and @entity29 ( r ) pictured last week			0
president @entity88 said in his @entity90 speech last night that the @entity36 would keep at @entity5 to end its nuclear program threats : @entity5 has stepped up threats to close the strategic @entity12 , through which a fifth of the world 's crude oil flows , in retaliation for facing sanctions the @entity36 has warned @entity14 that closing the @entity12 , which carries one - fifth of the world 's oil exports , would trigger a massive military response from the @entity100			1
the message was underlined at the weekend when @entity1 , the @entity36 and @entity58 sent six warships through the @entity12			1
the tensions come amid mounting concern that @entity14 is close to developing a nuclear weapon			0
after talks to agree the new @entity49 sanctions , foreign secretary @entity106 said there was ' no plausible civilian explanation ' for @entity5 's programme of uranium enrichment			2
pressure : @entity1 foreign secretary @entity106 said there was ' no plausible civilian explanation ' for @entity5 's nuclear programme he vowed to keep increasing the pressure on @entity14 and said the sanction ' represented a significant increase in peaceful and legitimate pressure on the @entity5 government to return to negotiations over its nuclear programme			1
' he added : ' until it does so the pressure will only increase			0
' between them , @entity49 member states import almost 600,000 barrels a day of @entity5 's crude oil exports – more than a fifth of the total – although only a tiny fraction ends up in the @entity1			2
a ban on exports of gold , precious metals and diamonds from @entity5 has also been imposed , along with more economic and travel bans on members of the hardline regime			2
backing the @entity49 stance , mr @entity45 said : ' it is not just that we endorse the actions taken in @entity145 for @entity79 , we of course will do the same for @entity44			0
the message needs to be delivered to the people of @entity5 , to the political elites as well as the government of @entity5 , that their behaviour is globally unacceptable			0
' this is not a piece of idle philanthropy on the part of @entity44 foreign policy , this costs , ' he said - pointing to tumbling exports to @entity5 '			1
he added : ' but it is a cost worth paying			0
' oil imports from @entity5 to @entity44 were now ' negligible ' however , he said			2
mr @entity106 urged the regime to ' come to its senses ' and resume talks on its nuclear programme			0
leading figures in @entity14 responded furiously			0
@entity169 , deputy head of the @entity5 parliament 's foreign affairs and security committee , said : ' if any disruption happens regarding the sale of @entity5 oil , the @entity12 will definitely be closed			1
' senior politician @entity176 added : ' in case of threat , the closure of the @entity12 is one of @entity5 's rights			1
' @entity1 sources believe full closure of the @entity12 remains unlikely because it would bring ' huge negative consequences ' for @entity14			1
but they fear @entity5 could engage in months of threats and disruption which would ramp up oil prices in the @entity100 without sparking a full military reprisal against @entity5			1
a @entity190 type 23 frigate , @entity8 , was part of the @entity36 - led carrier group which passed through the strait , which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point			1
threat : the @entity29 and @entity30 during the handover in the @entity31			0
the departure of the @entity30 prompted @entity5 to warn the @entity36 not to send any more carriers world map illustrating global sea trade in oil and highlighting the @entity12 the @entity202 , an aircraft carrier with a fleet of 90 planes , headed the group			1
it was escorted by the @entity8 , a guided missile cruiser and two destroyers from the @entity210 and a @entity58 warship			0
insiders said it was unusual for a flotilla made up of ships from three separate navies to pass within a few miles of the @entity5 coastline			2
a defence source rejected suggestions that it was a provocative move intended to increase pressure on @entity5 , adding : ' it is a statement that makes abundantly clear that these are international waters and all countries need to respect that			1
this shows that we are working in partnership and solidarity			0
' professor @entity230 , a senior research fellow at the think - tank @entity231 , said he doubted @entity14 would carry out its threat to blockade the strait , for fear of sparking a ' shooting war ' with the @entity36 instead , he said , an oil blockade would encourage hardliners in @entity5 to launch a wave of terror attacks			1
professor @entity230 said an oil blockade was unlikely to succeed , because @entity14 could ship its oil , which makes up 50 per cent of its revenues , through pipelines to @entity248 and @entity249			2
he added : ' history is littered with failed oil embargoes			0
however , the lessons of history appear to have passed by the decision makers of the @entity49			0
' @entity49 governments are calculating that the loss of @entity79 oil markets will persuade @entity5 to reopen talks on its nuclear plans			2
the ban has been phased in partly to ease the impact on @entity49 nations facing economic difficulties and which are very dependent on @entity5 oil			1
the @entity1 , @entity56 , @entity58 and the @entity265 led calls for nothing more than a three - month delay before the sanctions bite , but @entity270 , which fears its economic woes will worsen if it can not find alternative suppliers at @entity5 - style preferential rates - urged a much longer phase - in to ease the pain			1
mr @entity106 said an oil embargo was designed to persuade the @entity5 government to launch ' meaningful ' talks with the international community on its nuclear intentions			2
@entity79 's foreign policy chief @entity281 also insisted the sanctions were needed to bring @entity5 back to the negotiating table			0
an offer to @entity5 three months ago to begin new talks has gone unanswered , she pointed out			0
but concern remains that sanctions designed to hit @entity5 will inevitably hit some @entity49 member states as well			2
based in @entity289 , @entity8 is the longest - serving type 23 frigate in the @entity190			2
built in the 1980s on the @entity292 , she was commissioned in 1991			0
following a £ 20m refit in 2009 - 2010 , @entity8 is now one of the most up - to - date and capable frigates in the @entity296 , with her weapons and sensors significantly enhanced			0
@entity8 , currently in the @entity299 , is part of the @entity302 - a @entity36 - led , 25 - nation , multinational naval partnership promoting security , stability and prosperity across 2.5m sq miles of international waters			1
about 40 per cent of the world 's shipping and a third of the world 's oil passes through the region , most through the chokepoint of the @entity12 , the @entity314 and the @entity315			0
the ship 's main tasks includes counter-terrorism , counter-piracy and building on established relationships with regional allies			0

defence secretary @entity6 says reinforcements could be sent if dispute with @entity5 escalates
@entity8 *deployed* as part of international flotilla of warships through @entity12
@entity55 , @entity57 and @entity24 make rare joint statement , warning @entity5 it would face economic isolation
@entity14 remains defiant and says it will block the sensitive oil - important @entity12
@entity36 warns that closure of the @entity12 would trigger a massive military response from the @entity100
