by @entity0 to most , @entity1 is a feel - good musical comedy which sees nuns combat crime in @entity5			1
but it seems the 90s blockbuster may also be the inspiration for @entity9 's latest approach to tackling slavery and trafficking			0
drafting in more than 450 nuns from a @entity15 order , the @entity12 has uncovered 250 kidnapped women in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 over the past year			1
inspiration ? @entity22 's 1992 film follows nuns fighting crime - a scheme now adopted by @entity9 police the @entity28 - funded scheme has been backed by @entity29 , who met with detective chief inspector @entity30 on april 11			1
describing the unusual move , @entity31 said : ' women from religious orders are in our cars on operations , at the coal face , on the front line			1
' the nuns come out with us			1
we make sure the premises are safe , then the victims are taken to the houses of the nuns			1
' experts have found victims are reluctant to interact with police as they are made to believe officers will beat them			1
more than 450 nuns from a @entity9 - based @entity15 order have joined the @entity12 @entity29 ( left ) has given it his backing after meeting with senior officers			1
sir @entity54 ( right ) , the @entity55 , said the pontiff 's backing is invaluable support for the scheme @entity1 was one of the highest grossing films of the 1990s			1
starring @entity22 as a singer - turned - crime fighter , @entity63 as mother superior , and @entity65 as a wayfaring teenager , the story is an emotional journey to tackle crime in @entity5			0
@entity22 , as @entity69 , is a lounge singer in the @entity70 , which is run by her mobster boyfriend @entity71			0
one night , she sees him kill his chauffeur , and he orders his cronies to kill her too			0
reluctantly taking refuge in @entity76 , @entity69 is persuaded to take on the persona of sister @entity69 and live the strict life of a nun			0
she resists the lifestyle - until she bonds with some of the sisters over a piano			2
and when she performs a rock - n - roll version of @entity87 at @entity88 , crowds of people - including teenagers - flock in off the street			0
newly - inspired , she takes her music to the convent classroom in a bid to get the kids off the path to crime and destitution			0
as they move through the city , successfully saving people from a life of crime , word spreads and eventually @entity103 travels to witness their work			0
with the help of plain - clothed nuns , many of whom speak @entity15 , officers can communicate more effectively with the women			1
the sisters , mostly from @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , have been accompanying officers on late - night raids since january 2013			1
plans are now being drafted to roll out the scheme across @entity119 following the unexpected results			2
pope @entity29 hailed the scheme as a model for police forces worldwide			1
speaking at a conference organised by the @entity126 for @entity127 and @entity128 , the pontiff said : ' human trafficking is an open wound on the body of contemporary society , a scourge upon the body of @entity135			0
it is a crime against humanity			0
' the scheme , believed to be the first of its kind , echoes the 1992 @entity22 classic - now a sell - out production on @entity9 's @entity143			2
playing a singer on the run from her mobster boyfriend , @entity22 's character @entity69 is put under protective custody in @entity76 convent			0
for her safety , she is told to disguise herself as a nun			0
indignant , she initially objects to the simple and strict life of the convent			0
but after befriending some of her fellow nuns at the piano , @entity69 is inspired to use music to bring the community together			2
the rest of the film is an emotional journey , following the @entity76 sisters as they reach out to @entity5 , and work with the underprivileged teenagers at the convent school , seemingly destined for a life of crime			2
now , with the backing of the pope , cities across the world could see the format cropping up			2
sir @entity54 , the @entity55 , said the pope 's backing emphasises the effectiveness of the project			2
' by making such a declaration it encourages governments to take this to a very high priority , ' he said			0
