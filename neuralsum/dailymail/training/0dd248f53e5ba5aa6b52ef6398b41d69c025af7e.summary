@entity0 is making final preparations for a once - in - a - million - years journey as a comet grazes the atmosphere of @entity5 on sunday			2
@entity7 / 2013 @entity6 , also known as comet @entity8 , will pass within about 87,000 miles ( 139,500 kilometers ) of the @entity9 on sunday - less than half the distance between @entity11 and our moon , and less than one - tenth the distance of any known comet flyby of @entity11			1
researchers say it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the @entity9 atmosphere			1
closest approach to @entity5 is on october 19 , 2014			0
spacecraft will collect in a ' duck and cover ' move to avoid dust from the comet @entity0 's five robotic explorers at @entity5 - three orbiters and two rovers - are being repurposed to witness a comet named @entity8 make its first known visit to the inner solar system			1
so are a @entity38 and an @entity40 spacecraft circling the red planet			1
the orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball , then hide behind @entity5 for protection from potentially dangerous dusty debris in the comet tail			2
shielded by the @entity9 atmosphere , the @entity48 and @entity49 rovers may well have the best seats in the house , although a dust storm on @entity5 could obscure the view			0
' think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it 's just coming in close now , ' said @entity59 , a senior astrophysicist at the @entity60 , in a @entity0 news briefing about @entity6 last week			1
' and the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers			0
we 've now got outposts around @entity5			0
' @entity8 's nucleus will come closest to @entity5 around 11:27 a.m. @entity69 ( 2:27 p.m. edt ) , hurtling at about 126,000 mph ( 56 kilometers per second )			2
this proximity will provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the @entity9 atmosphere			1
' this is a cosmic science gift that could potentially keep on giving , and the agency 's diverse science missions will be in full receive mode , ' said @entity82 , astronaut and associate administrator for @entity0 's @entity84 in @entity85			0
' this particular comet has never before entered the inner solar system , so it will provide a fresh source of clues to our solar system 's earliest days			1

@entity0 's @entity5 orbiters lining up behind @entity5 for their ' duck and cover ' maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of @entity6 ( @entity6 ) on oct. 19 , 2014			1
' we certainly have fingers crossed for the first images of a comet from the surface of another world , ' said @entity0 program scientist @entity122			2
spacecraft farther afield , including the @entity123 , already are keeping a sharp lookout , as are ground observatories and research balloons			2
' we 're getting ready for a spectacular set of observations , ' said @entity129 , head of @entity0 's planetary science division			0
named for the @entity132 observatory used to detect it in january 2013 , @entity8 will approach @entity5 from beneath and zoom right in front sunday afternoon , @entity135			0
on @entity11 , the best viewing , via binoculars or telescope , will be from the @entity140 - @entity139 and @entity132 will be in prime position			0
in the @entity143 , it will be difficult to see @entity8 slide by @entity5			0
the comet - with a nucleus estimated to be at least a half - mile in diameter - hails from the @entity148 on the extreme fringe of the solar system			1
it formed during the first million or two years of the solar system 's birth 4.6 billion years ago and , until now , ventured no closer to the sun than perhaps the orbits of @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 or @entity159			1
it comes around every one or more million years			0
it will be the first @entity148 comet to be studied up close in detail			1
for comparison , the flyby distance of 87,000 miles is about one - third of the way from here to the moon			1
@entity8 's tail could extend from @entity11 all the way to our moon			0
its gaseous coma , the fuzzy head surrounding the nucleus , might stretch halfway to the moon			0
no comet has come anywhere near this close to @entity11 in recorded history			2
' we ca n't get to an @entity148 comet with our current rockets ... so this comet is coming to us , ' said @entity59 , senior astrophysicist at @entity60 's applied physics laboratory			1
by studying @entity8 's composition and structure , scientists hope to learn more about how the planets formed , according to @entity59			2
@entity6 comes from the @entity148 , material left over from the formation of the solar system			1
' this comet is coming into the solar system straight from the @entity148			1
it 's likely this is its first time this close to the sun , ' said space scientist @entity197 , of the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) in @entity199 , @entity200			0
@entity148 material , including comets , is scattered through a vast region that begins outside the orbits of @entity159 and @entity205 and extends a substantial fraction of the distance to @entity208 , the closest neighboring star			1
@entity148 comets can tell scientists about the materials - including water and carbon compounds - that existed during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago			1
the images above show -- before and after filtering -- comet @entity6 , also known as @entity8 , as captured by @entity220 on @entity0 's @entity123			1
studying this close encounter will be the largest fleet of orbiting scientific observatories ever flown to another world , orbiting around ( and rolling on the ground of ) @entity5			0
these instruments will , for the first time ever , have the chance to make close - up observations of a comet new to the inner solar system			1
and though it will not be the easiest task , the teams operating these instruments and spacecraft have developed plans to take advantage of this rare opportunity			1
siding spring is small ( the nucleus is less than a mile in diameter ) and fast ( it will pass @entity5 at about 34 miles per second )			1
@entity241 , @entity242 , and @entity243 were built to study a slowly - moving planet , so they will use @entity243 's ability to rotate in order to capture images as the comet speeds by @entity5			1
the instruments will observe the comet repeatedly for two and a half days as it gets closer and closer to @entity5 before it makes its closest approach			2
the peak density of comet dust at @entity5 is expected 98 minutes after closest approach of the nucleus , and the @entity243 spacecraft will position itself behind the planet at that time			1
how graphic shows the science observations that may be captured by @entity5 spacecraft during the close encounter with @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
scientists also are keen to spot any changes to the comet or @entity5 due to the close approach			2
@entity0 's newly arrived @entity268 spacecraft , for instance , will compare the upper atmosphere before and after it passes			2
' think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it 's just coming in close now , ' @entity59 said			2
' and the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers			0
' we 've now got outposts around @entity5			0
' scientists initially worried the spacecraft orbiting @entity5 would be at considerable risk from the comet 's massive trail of dust			1
the nucleus itself poses no danger of impact			0
but the particles in the tail , hurtling through space at 126,000 mph could fry electronics , puncture fuel lines , or destroy computers , transmitters or other vital spacecraft parts			0
this graphic depicts the orbit of comet c / 2013 @entity300 as it swings around the sun in 2014			0
as @entity8 's path became clearer , the threat level was deemed minimal			0
still , space agencies are taking no chances			0
they 're employing the ' duck and cover ' strategy			1
@entity0 's three orbiters - @entity311 , @entity243 and newcomer maven - will be behind the red planet at the time of peak danger			1
that 's a 20 - minute - or - so period approximately 1 1/2 hours after the closest approach by the comet 's nucleus			0
the @entity320 also shifted the orbit of its @entity322 as did @entity40 for its @entity323 , or @entity323 , the country 's first interplanetary spacecraft that , like @entity0 's @entity268 , arrived last month			0
the precautions are prudent , said @entity328 senior research scientist @entity327 , who led a hazard - analysis team			0
' @entity330 are complex beasts and do n't always live up to our predictions , ' @entity327 said in an email wednesday			0
' if you do n't want surprises , then do n't study comets			0
' it will take at least a few days to obtain and analyze the best spacecraft data ; but images made from @entity11 should be forthcoming pretty quickly			2
@entity8 should pass closest to the sun six days after its @entity5 flyby , then swing back out , bidding goodbye , for at least another million years			0
@entity0 's @entity5 orbiters will gather information before , during and after the flyby about the size , rotation and activity of the comet 's nucleus , the variability and gas composition of the coma around the nucleus , and the size and distribution of dust particles in the comet 's tail			2
on oct. 19 , the comet will have a very close pass at @entity5 , just 82,000 miles ( 132,000 kilometers ) from the planet			1
observations of the @entity9 atmosphere are designed to check for possible meteor trails , changes in distribution of neutral and charged particles , and effects of the comet on air temperature and clouds			0
@entity268 will have a particularly good opportunity to study the comet , and how its tenuous atmosphere , or coma , interacts with @entity5 ' upper atmosphere			2
@entity11 - based and space telescopes , including @entity0 's iconic @entity123 , also will be in position to observe the unique celestial object			0
the agency 's astrophysics space observatories -- @entity384 , @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity387 -- and the ground - based @entity388 on @entity389 , @entity390 -- also will be tracking the event .			0

@entity6 , will pass within about 87,000 miles ( 139,500 kilometers ) of the red planet
researchers hope to capture first image of a comet from another planet
will provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to gather data
siding spring comes from the @entity148 , material left over from the formation of the solar system
