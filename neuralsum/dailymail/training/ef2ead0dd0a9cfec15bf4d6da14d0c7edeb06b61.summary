@entity0 believes @entity1 have the firepower to propel themselves to the top of the @entity5 – despite having no fit strikers available			1
the champions can move into pole position on saturday if they beat @entity9 by a four - goal margin			1
but they must do so without @entity12 and @entity13 , who are out until the new year , and @entity14 , who will not be fit until @entity15 at the earliest			1
@entity16 ( centre ) and @entity18 ( right ) train as @entity1 prepare for saturday 's match with @entity9 @entity18 ( second right ) could start as a false nine for @entity1 as they seek a win that could see them move to the top of the @entity5 @entity25 provides another attacking alternative for @entity1 , who will take on @entity9 without a fit striker @entity29 ( centre ) has also provided a goal threat in recent weeks and will look to keep scoring over @entity32 for @entity1 it leaves @entity0 desperately short of options up front			1
@entity36 could be used as a false no 9 , while @entity18 , @entity38 and 18 - year - old @entity39 are also contenders for the role			2
@entity0 says he has faith in his squad to cope			1
‘ none of them are fit so we have to arrange without @entity14 , without @entity13 , without @entity48 ( @entity12 ) , ’ the @entity44 said			1
‘ we will try to play in another way			0
i hope that midfielders will arrive from the second line and we will score in another way			0
‘ we will have to change our way to play , a different system because when you do n’t have strikers you must arrive at the goal in a different way			2
‘ i hope we will do it			0
i know that we play against a team that defend very well so we will see what is the best solution to play without them			0
’ @entity0 says contract negotiations with @entity64 and @entity36 are progressing , despite no announcement being made			2
the 18 - year - old @entity39 is also an option for @entity1 to consider - he has made his first appearances for the club this season city manager @entity0 is confident goalkeeper @entity64 ( centre ) will sign a new contract with the @entity5 champions the @entity1 squad goes through its paces as the finishing touches are made before the @entity9 match on saturday @entity64 is poised to sign a five - year deal but reports have suggested talks over @entity36 ’s proposed four - year contract have stalled			1
‘ we are talking with @entity36 , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ it is not easy for all the players to sign a new contract			0
‘ there are a lot of things to talk , to decide , discuss			0
i hope finally @entity36 will sign his contract			0
i repeat , the same as with @entity64 , he wants to stay and the club wants to keep him			0

@entity1 will take on @entity9 without strikers @entity12 , @entity92 and @entity14
defender and *captain* @entity94 is also *absent* but @entity1 could return to the top of the league with a win
@entity0 's side need to beat @entity9 by a four - goal margin to *replace* @entity102 at the summit of the table
