it sounds like a creature from mythical lore , but a two - headed mutant snake has been spotted slithering its way through a village in @entity6			1
the snake , which is believed to be a checkered keelback , was seen crawling past a house in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the non-venamous snake slithered onto @entity14 's patio , leaving him just enough time to capture the magical moment on his camera phone			1
and in a flash it was gone , wriggling into a bush before he had a chance to catch it			1
it was never seen again			2
beware the two - headed snake ! the snake , which is believed to be a checkered keelback , was seen crawling past a house in @entity10 , @entity11 ' it happened at the blink of an eye			1
the snake came across and was gliding along the surface , ' @entity14 said			1
' i only managed to take shots with my phone			2
it was all gone within seconds			2
' the two - headed creature then slinked away into the nearby bushes before it could be caught			1
the village of @entity10 is known for sightings of snakes , including the mighty @entity42			1
@entity44 customer : the two - headed creature then slinked away into the nearby bushes before it could be caught heads up ! the snake is reminiscent of the seven - headed @entity46 from @entity48 mythology which grows two new heads every time one is cut off			1
this still from the 1963 film ' @entity53 ' , shows actor @entity54 fighting the creature @entity14 , who lives in the village , added : ' snakes are sighted here very often because of close proximity to the forests			2
but they do n't attack humans			0
the condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly , with two - headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly			1
but the creatures rarely live beyond a few months			0
each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain , and they share control of the organs and limbs , though the specific structure of the connections varies			1
such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion , with the brains ' arguing ' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig - zag without getting anywhere			0

farmer @entity86 named it reflection			0
in snakes , each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other			2
