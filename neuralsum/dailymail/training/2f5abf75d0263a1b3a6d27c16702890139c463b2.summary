do n't be alarmed – these dozing tots in the electrode head caps are in fine health			0
in fact , they 're providing the proof that mothers who exercise during pregnancy give their children a head start in life			1
researchers found that being exposed to physical activity while in the womb boosts brain development			1
just three 20 - minute sessions a week makes a difference			1
the @entity18 researchers looked at new babies – such as the one in the picture – but believe the benefits could last for life			1
the babies , above , were played sounds by researchers , who then monitored their brain activity			1
it was established that the tots whose mothers had exercised during pregnancy showed greater brain development ‘ we are optimistic that this will encourage women to change their health habits , given that the simple act of exercising during pregnancy could make a difference for their child ’s future , ’ said the team from the @entity33			1
they asked ten pregnant women to exercise enough to leave them slightly short of breath at least three times a week			0
they clocked up an average of almost two hours of exercise a week – some walked briskly , while others ran , cycled or went swimming			0
a second group of mothers - to - be did not take part in exercise and so were only moderately active for around ten minutes a week			1
when the babies were born , the researchers measured their brain activity using a cap covered in more than 100 electrodes cushioned in sponges			1
as each baby slept on its mother ’s lap , it was played a bleeping noise repeatedly			0
occasionally , the bleeps were interrupted by a second sound			0
brain activity , picked up painlessly by the cap , showed that the babies whose mothers had exercised found it easier to tell the two sounds apart			1
this is seen as a sign of maturity and suggests their brains had developed more rapidly			0
‘ our research indicates that exercise during pregnancy enhances the newborn ’s brain development , ’ said study leader professor @entity76			1
the annual conference of the @entity84 heard that previous research had concluded that exercise in pregnancy improves iq and vocabulary until at least the age of five			0
other research suggested that women who are active in pregnancy may be boosting the heart health of their children in later life			2
it is not clear why exercise helps the unborn child ’s brain but it may be that it increases the oxygen supply			2
exercise may also increase production of a brain - boosting protein called @entity104			2
researcher @entity106 - @entity105 said that exercising in pregnancy could be a simple and inexpensive way to give a baby a head start in life			2
‘ thinking about your child is very good motivation but also do it for yourself , ’ she said			0
‘ you are training to give birth and that is probably going to be the hardest thing you will do in your life			2
if you are physically fit it could be a little easier to get through it and get back from it			0
’ colleague professor @entity122 said : ‘ while being sedentary increases the risks of suffering complications during pregnancy , being active can ease post-birth recovery , make pregnancy more comfortable and reduce the risk of obesity in children			0

*neuroscientists* in @entity18 made the *discovery* by playing noises to babies
newborns whose mothers exercised could *recognise* different sounds
researchers say early brain development could make a difference in life
