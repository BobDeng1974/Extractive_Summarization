it may sound like a plot straight out of a science fiction novel , but a @entity4 mission to blow up the moon with a nuke was very real in the 1950s			1
at the height of the space race , the @entity4 considered detonating an atom bomb on the moon as a display of @entity4 's @entity13 muscle			2
the secret project , innocuously titled ' @entity15 ' and nicknamed ' @entity16 , ' was never carried out			0
plot : the @entity4 was planning to launch an atomic bomb , like @entity18 , pictured above , that would be launched into space in a scrapped plan to blow up the moon brains of the operation : astronomer @entity25 , left , was involved in the planning of the mission and physicist @entity28 , right , was the man in charge however , its planning included calculations by astronomer @entity25 , then a young graduate student , of the behavior of dust and gas generated by the blast			1
viewing the nuclear flash from @entity40 might have intimidated the @entity41 and boosted @entity4 confidence after the launch of @entity44 , physicist @entity28 told the @entity45 in a 2000 interview			1
@entity28 , now 85 , directed the inquiry at the former @entity48 , now part of the @entity50			0
he later served as a deputy director at @entity52			0
would you miss it ? @entity4 scientists were looking to blow up the moon to get an edge of the @entity41 in the space race @entity25 , who later became renowned for popularizing science on television , died in 1996			1
the author of one of @entity25 's biographies suggested that he may have committed a security breach in 1959 after revealing the classified project in an academic fellowship application			2
under the scenario , a missile carrying a small nuclear device was to be launched from an undisclosed location and travel 238,000 miles to the moon , where it would be detonated upon impact			0
the planners decided it would have to be an atom bomb because a hydrogen bomb would have been too heavy for the missile			0
@entity28 said the nation â€™s young space program probably could have carried out the mission by 1959 , when the @entity82 deployed inter-continental ballistic missiles			1
military officials apparently abandoned the idea because of the danger to people on @entity40 in case the mission failed			1
the scientists also registered concerns about contaminating the moon with radioactive material , @entity28 said			2
when contacted by the @entity45 , the @entity82 declined to comment on the project .			0

scientists were *hoping* for giant flash on the moon that would intimidate the @entity41
aim of mission was to launch the nuke by 1959
plan was later scrapped *due* to possible danger to people on @entity40
