by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 02:37 est , 16 october 2013 the number of complaints about doctors made by their colleagues or patients is on the rise , according to new figures			1
data from the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) shows a jump in both patient complaints and the number of doctors willing to speak up about the poor standards of other medics			1
in 2012 , the @entity9 received 8,109 complaints - a 24 per cent increase since 2011 and a 104 per cent increase since 2007			1
new figures have revealed the number of complaints made about doctors is on the rise the new data reveals that between 2007 and 2012 , the overall number of complaints from the public rose by 87 per cent to 5,014			1
while most came from patients and their friends and relatives , a significant amount were made by doctors ' employers and concerned colleagues			1
the @entity9 , which regulates around 250,000 doctors in the @entity33 , said the overall number of complaints is very small when the number of interactions between doctors and patients is taken into account			1
@entity40 said the high expectations of patients and willingness of some doctors to point out areas of concern compared to others should be taken into account when considering the rise			0
overall , 54 per cent of the complaints were about clinical care and communication with patients			0
many made by doctors ( 38 per cent ) concerned conflict of interest or criminal convictions held by their colleagues			2
among the public , people aged 46 to 60 were the most likely to complain , with women more likely to speak up than men			0
gps were more likely to be complained about than other doctors , and male medics were twice as likely to attract criticism than their female counterparts			1
twenty - two per cent of male gps received a complaint compared with just 11 per cent of female gps			1
the number of doctors aged over 50 who were complained about was higher than for doctors aged 30 to 50			1
female gps were less likely to be complained about than their male colleagues , according to the study			1
posed by models this was particularly true for @entity75 , the @entity79 and practice report showed			1
a third of all complaints received met the threshold for a full investigation by the @entity9 , but only 20 per cent of those lodged by the public satisfied the same criteria			2
eighty - four per cent of all concerns raised by employers merited an investigation , as did 48 per cent of those made by doctors			1
professor sir @entity94 , chair of the @entity9 , said : ' overall the standard of care that patients receive in the @entity33 is good and doctors continue to deserve the trust and respect of the public			2
' the @entity9 has an important role to play in protecting patients and ensuring that doctors practise to the highest possible standard			2
' complaints from members of the public , doctors and other professionals are invaluable in helping us to do this			2
' complaints also give the health service a chance to reflect and improve the care that patients receive			0
' however what our report shows is that some patients do n’t know where to go to raise a concern about their treatment and more needs to be done to help them raise issues			0
' making a complaint about a doctor can be stressful and it is important that concerns are raised with the right organisation so patients are not passed from pillar to post			0
' ends @entity135 , chair of @entity136 , said : ' it ’s no surprise that people do n’t know who to go to with their complaint as the system is far too complex			0
' most patients and people receiving care do n’t know the difference between the @entity9 , the @entity146 and their local complaints advocacy services			2
they just want their complaint dealt with			0
' but people are n’t just failing to report complaints because they do n’t know where to go			0
' we know from our own research that more than half of those who experienced a problem in the last three years did n’t report it because they simply did n’t trust the system to listen or take any action			0
' we all have a right to safe , dignified and high quality care , backed up by an effective complaints system for when things go wrong			0
the @entity164 can play a central role helping people understand where to go with their complaint , making things as simple and straightforward as possible			0
