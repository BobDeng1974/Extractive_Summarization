former @entity1 mayor @entity0 called on black communities to do more to prevent crime in their own neighbourhoods former @entity1 mayor @entity0 has sparked fresh outrage by suggesting black communities need to do more to stop crime in their own neighborhoods			1
@entity0 said there was ' no question ' unjustified shootings happen more often in black neighborhoods , but called on those communities to do more to curb violence so police were not called there in the first place			1
he was speaking after being shown a video of an officer in @entity21 killing 12 - year - old @entity22 as he was holding an airsoft pellet gun			1
@entity0 told @entity24 said : ' there 's no question that individual cases have situations that are unjustified , but you 've got to put it in proper context			0
' why is it happening ? why is it happening more often in the black community ? and does n't it actually logically make sense that it 's going to happen more often in the community where there is five , six , seven , eight , nine times more violence than in another community ? ' the comments were shared widely across social media , though users did n't appear particularly surprised by @entity0 's stance , which has remained largely the same since the fatal shooting of @entity47 teenager @entity46 on august 9			1
the @entity48 tweeted : ' if a policeman shoots you for no reason , you 've only got yourself to blame , says @entity0 '			0
another user said the former mayor ' double downs on blaming black community for police problems '			0
last week @entity0 caused a stir by suggesting more white officers were needed in certain neighborhoods to keep black people from killing one another			2
he did , however , admit there was ' more unfair interaction ' between police officers and people in black communities			1
while the police force needed to be more diverse and better train their staff , ' just as much , if not more , responsibility is on the black community to reduce the reason why the police officers ' were assigned to black neighborhoods			2
@entity0 went on to say he had changed his mind about the need for body cameras because he believes they would show that 90 or 95 per cent of police shootings are justified			2
@entity0 made the remarks after being shown a video of an officer in @entity21 killing 12 - year - old @entity22 as he was holding an @entity89 pellet gun demonstrators protest outside the @entity92 @entity91 yesterday over the policing shooting of @entity94 on august 9 police officer @entity95 was not indicted but resigned following the shooting of @entity94 the comments come as the police officer responsible shooting @entity94 resigned			1
@entity95 , who had been on administrative leave since the august 9 shooting , said that he did n't want to put the lives of his colleagues at risk			0
@entity47 has been a hotbed of riots and protests since @entity94 's death and in the lead - up to the @entity110 decision not to charge @entity46			2
@entity0 had earlier spoken out about the case saying that prosecutors should never have tried to indict @entity46 in front of a grand jury , something he said was simply political theatre			0
the remarks later led to accusations during a tv interview that @entity0 was a white supremacist			0
he refused to ' dignify ' the question with an answer but went on to say he ' probably saved more black lives as mayor of @entity1 than any mayor in the history of this city ' .			0

@entity0 said @entity47 case should never have gone to @entity110
then said more police were needed to stop murders in black communities
