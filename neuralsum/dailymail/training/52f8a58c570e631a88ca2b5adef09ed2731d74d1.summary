@entity0 is making a concerted bid to be named the next @entity3 captain for the 2016 contest in @entity5 at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
this has required @entity0 , who can be a moody presence , to mount a charm offensive before january ’s decision			2
@entity0 , @entity12 champion in 2011 , is becoming much more visible around events and during the past week he has been noticeably more agreeable with the media			1
charm offensive : @entity0 is making a bid to be named the next @entity18 @entity3 captain video @entity19 : @entity21 highlights and a new slim - line look - @entity0 ’s fitness programme has seen him shed more than four stone - can only help with his image building			1
the captaincy decision will be made by the three most recent @entity3 leaders - @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 - plus @entity18 tour chief @entity30 and a further committee member			2
@entity33 is likely to be @entity0 ’s main rival and the @entity35 will have the vote of his compatriot @entity28 and probably that of @entity27 , who is not close to @entity0 , with whom he contested the 2014 @entity39 captaincy			1
but @entity0 has the more stellar @entity3 record , especially at @entity41 in 2006 when he won three points from three matches a month after the death of his wife , @entity45			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity47 owner @entity46 may not have attended any major championship during the 10 years he has had £ 2million riding on the result as part of his ‘ no win no fee ’ @entity54 sponsorship of @entity55 , @entity0 and @entity56			1
however , sports direct tycoon @entity46 has still taken a significant stake in online company @entity59 , who sell equipment and clothing			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity63 , departed chief executive of @entity64 , took advantage of being between jobs to be at @entity67			0
@entity63 , who declined to take an unspecified job in another part of @entity64 owner @entity71 ’s empire , would like to stay in football			0
but leaving @entity64 means he has to stand down from the @entity73 and the @entity75 board where he had reduced the average age significantly			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. supporters of @entity79 , who bombard @entity80 if they see any negative comments about their favourite , should know he is always quick to bite back himself			0
like describing this columnist on the @entity84 as an ‘ inky - fisted peasant scribe ’ for mentioning the 83 - year - old calling @entity12 joint runner - up ‘ @entity86 , rather than @entity88			0
and as for ‘ inky - fisted ’ , what about @entity79 ’s 1983 bonkbuster @entity90 , a sex novel about ageing golfer @entity93 ’s desperate attempts to recapture past glories - now available second - hand on @entity96 for 1p but , conspicuously , not included among books @entity79 lists on his official website			0
business : @entity47 owner @entity46 has taken a significant stake in online company @entity59 @entity27 goes awol it seems wrong that @entity18 @entity3 captain @entity27 should be holidaying in @entity102 during @entity12			1
especially when all his potential @entity39 team have been at @entity67 - along with the @entity5 - playing in a tournament that best replicates the pressures of a @entity3			1
in contrast , @entity5 captain @entity106 has played all four days in preparation for september ’s clash			0
it is said that this is the only week when @entity27 can fit in a break and missing @entity12 did not affect @entity114 ’s preparations for a @entity18 victory in the @entity5 in 2004			2
@entity116 : @entity27 is holidaying in @entity102 during which his potential @entity39 team were in @entity67 open champion @entity118 will have the distraction - not that it proved to be one at @entity67 - of the court case over his representation agreement with estranged agents @entity125 dragging on until january after today ’s discovery hearing in @entity127 was postponed			1
a tactical error by the @entity84 has to be shelving an @entity12 highlights show when @entity130 are going to be such strong challengers for the rights after 2016			0
the @entity84 point to @entity134 and their website as places to catch up but a tailor - made programme used to be a key part of their coverage , at least until former head of sport @entity142 objected to there being ‘ too many highlights in the highlights show ’ .			0

@entity0 bidding to be named next @entity149 captain
2011 @entity12 champion has become much more visible around events
@entity47 owner @entity46 has taken a *siginificant* stake in @entity59
@entity27 holidaying in @entity102 while potential @entity39 team have been playing in @entity67
