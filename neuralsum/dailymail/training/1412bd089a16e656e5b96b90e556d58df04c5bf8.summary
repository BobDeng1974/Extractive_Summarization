@entity1 's hopes of transforming his @entity3 career have suffered another blow after @entity5 warned he must get used to being a substitute			1
the @entity8 striker is available for the game at @entity10 after serving a one - match suspension but @entity3 ’s manager has no intentions of handing @entity1 an immediate recall			1
@entity3 ’s performances have improved recently since @entity5 reverted to a 3 - 4 - 3 formation and the manager says @entity1 does not have the traits to play that role			1
@entity1 ( left ) is yet to set the @entity20 alight following his £ 16million move to @entity3 @entity1 and @entity22 ( right ) appear in a light - hearted mood as @entity3 train on @entity25 mid-table @entity3 head to @entity27 knowing that only a victory will suffice as they hope for a top four spot it is the latest sign that @entity1 ’s career at @entity33 is doomed to failure and @entity5 would not provide any assurances to the 24 - year - old that he will be starting any time soon			1
when asked how @entity1 would deal with being a substitute , @entity5 said : ‘ it ’s something he would have to			2
if the team is going to need him from the bench , then it ’s something he would have to become adjusted to			2
‘ it ’s the same for every single player , not just him			0
when called upon — whether it ’s to start a game or come off the bench — you ask your players to be ready			0
’ @entity1 has not scored in the @entity20 since joining @entity3 in a £ 16million deal in august and , due to a combination of injuries and suspension , he has only played 124 minutes since november 8			1
his manager feels he does not have the attributes to thrive in the style @entity3 play			2
@entity1 was last seen in a @entity3 shirt as a substitute during the 3 - 0 mauling at @entity61 @entity5 ( right ) must pick up the mercurial @entity62 in order to resurrect his short @entity3 career @entity5 added : ‘ we have seen it ’s not really his game ( to press defenders and run )			1
working with him for the period of time he ’s been here , we have seen that he ’s probably someone who ’s better in and around the box			0
‘ so that level of intensity and pressing is n’t part of his game			0
but you try to get the best out of the players you have and the qualities they have			0
‘ that ’s something we will focus on			0
the most important thing is that he is now available and adds another player to this squad			0
