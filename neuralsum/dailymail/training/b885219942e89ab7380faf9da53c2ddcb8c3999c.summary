miss @entity7 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , also suffers from polycystic ovarian syndrome which hampers her ability to lose weight naturally			1
she said : ‘ i blame no - one but myself , but my experiences have made me realise that gastric operations , which are often viewed as a quick fix , do n’t make any difference if the root causes of obesity are n’t addressed			1
‘ i ’ve had low self - esteem rooted in difficult experiences from my childhood that have caused me to comfort eat over the years			1
’ success : miss @entity7 lost an impressive 8 stone after the surgery to reduce the size of her stomach yo - yo : but she has now piled 3st back on again due to comfort eating - and is warning others that weight - loss surgery is n't a cure - all despite displaying the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity45 ) all her adult life , miss @entity7 was not diagnosed with the condition until she was in her mid- 30s and weighed 17st			1
she said : ‘ i enjoyed the occasional chocolate bar but i did n’t habitually drink litres of fizzy drinks and i was n’t always out eating enormous meals			1
i found it confusing that i managed to become quite so big			0
‘ i learned that @entity45 creates problems with insulin production , which affects the way food is processed in the body , which is why people with the condition often struggle with weight gain			1
miss @entity7 at her lowest weight , weighing 11st and wearing a size 10			1
she said : ' i ¿ ve had low self - esteem rooted in difficult experiences from my childhood that have caused me to comfort eat over the years ' ‘ it put my weight problems in context but was difficult to hear - i had suffered a miscarriage a year earlier and had experienced a rough few months			1
it was painful to get the diagnosis			0
‘ i became more depressed which meant i became more sedentary and comfort ate			2
’ @entity78 breakfast : slice of toast or porridge lunch : cheese sandwiches dinner : @entity86 with rice or pasta served with chicken or vegetables snacks : half a packet of digestives and two chocolate bars , with odd helpings of chocolate cake , muffins or flapjacks			1
she said : ' main meals were n't a problem - but snacking was			1
i could n't help dipping into sweet foods throughout the day			2
' after bypass surgery first month : flavoured milk three times a day second month : pureed food or ready - brek twice a day			2
six months : small amount of soft pasta or soft rice twice a day			0
after a year she could manage half a sandwich for a main meal			0
but as the months passed , she began gorging on chocolate bars as a source of comfort food			1
she said : ' it did n't matter to me what chocolate bar it was , as long as it was chocolate			2
i fell back into the habit without really thinking about it			2
' @entity125 breakfast : porridge with banana lunch : @entity130 with a small roll dinner : portion - controlled chilli con carne or pasta dish snacks : yogurt or fruit			2
an endocrinologist referred @entity139 to a specialist team at @entity141 in @entity142 and after a year she was told she had been recommended for a gastric bypass operation			0
the @entity5 - funded operation , which costs up to £ 15,000 , took place in march 2009 , when she weighed 19st			0
miss @entity7 said : ‘ it was reasoned that it was better in the long - run to get my weight down quickly to prevent serious problems like diabetes and heart disease			1
‘ i ’d never thought about surgery			0
it had never occurred to me that it would have been offered			0
but when it was suggested , i paid close attention to what the doctors said			0
‘ i was surprised at the offer , but i understood the logic			0
it would have cost the health service more to treat me if i was morbidly obese and diabetic			0
’ after discussing the matter with her parents , miss @entity7 , who is a support worker for deaf people , decided the gastric bypass operation was the right option			1
she said : ‘ i signed a disclaimer which confirmed i understood that the operation could have complications and serious health consequences			0
for the two nights leading up to the operation i was very anxious			0
‘ i ate like a baby for the first few months , slowly introducing solid food back to my diet			0
it was a challenge , but a dream come true to see the weight drop off so quickly			0
‘ having had no confidence for years , to start thinking about what outfits i would wear to work and for when i was out socialising with friends was truly wonderful			0
’ but by the spring of 2011 , miss @entity7 realised that her gastric bypass had not been the fix - all option many hope it will be			1
she said : ‘ i have painful memories from my childhood and self - esteem issues which the gastric bypass was never going to address			2
‘ i found myself subconsciously dipping back into the comfort eating			1
the weight started to creep back up			2
’ today , miss @entity7 weighs 14st and has excess skin left from her weight loss			1
she is now having counselling and has started a healthy eating and exercise routine today , miss @entity7 weighs 14st and has excess skin left from her weight loss			1
she said : ‘ i ’m back at being obese again but i can see a solution			2
i have a good support network of friends and i ’m sure i can get that 3st off again			0
‘ i ’m having counselling to address the self - esteem issues and has started a healthy eating and exercise routine			2
‘ my excess skin will never be removed unless i ’m judged to be an exceptional case by the health services			0
i feel embarrassed talking to my doctor about it , because i feel i ’ve already had so much help with my weight loss			0
‘ there ’s an awful feeling that i ’m not doing my part to live up to the effort that other people went to for my operation			0
‘ but i ’ve come to realise that , sadly , if you do n’t address the root problems , all the benefits of such operations can be undone			0
‘ today whenever i hear anyone say they ’re going for weight loss surgery , i always make sure i share my experiences			2
patients need to be very mindful following their operations			0
‘ if there are psychological or other issues at the root of the weight gain , those issues need to tackled first , or all the effort in the world can go to waste			1

@entity7 , 41 , *initially* lost an impressive 8st after the op five years *ago*
but she has now piled 3st back on and is obese again after comfort eating chocolate bars instead of sticking to a controlled *regime*
now wants to warn people that gastric surgery is n't a cure - all - and the root - cause of weight gain must be addressed before the op
