new shots of the rumoured @entity1 have been revealed ahead of an expected launch in august or september this year			1
the images , republished by nowhereelse.fr , are similar to ones leaked before and lend credibility to claims this is what the next device will look like			2
it appears that @entity13 ’s latest creation will be thinner than its predecessors , and also have rounded edges , making it not too dissimilar to the @entity17			1
latest images of @entity13 's supposed @entity1 were leaked last month ( shown ) , showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images			1
the power button , typically found on the top of previous @entity24 , appears to have been moved to the side , making the device easier to operate with one hand the latest photos show that the tentatively named @entity29 will be made from metal , and will also be much thinner than @entity13 's current range of devices			1
rumours suggest @entity13 is working on two versions of different sizes , with one being 4.7 inches ( 11.9cm ) diagonally , the same size as the @entity17			1
a larger version is also expected to be released , measuring 5.5 inches ( 14cm ) - slightly larger than @entity39 's 5.1 - inch @entity38			0
in the images some changes to button placement can also be seen			0
the power button , usually found on the top of @entity24 for example , appears to be located on the side of the device			0
the volume and lock buttons , however , will seemingly remain where they are			0
look familiar ? the rumoured back of @entity13 ’s new @entity1 6 looks similar to that of the @entity17 ( pictured right ) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges			1
it also suggests @entity13 may have found a way to make its ' @entity58 ' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an @entity60 @entity13 's @entity29 is rumoured to come in a slim ' @entity62 ' version			2
up until august last year , @entity63 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity67 , at 0.24 inches ( 6.18 millimetres )			2
this was then replaced by the @entity69 at just 0.23 inches ( 5.75 millimetres )			0
by comparison , @entity13 ’s current @entity60 has a depth of 0.3 inches ( 7.6 millimetres ) , while the @entity72 is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches ( 7.5 millimetres )			2
@entity39 's @entity73 is 0.31 inches ( 7.9 millimetres ) thick , while the @entity17 is 0.37 inches ( 9.3 millimetres )			2
it is believed the @entity1 6 , which some think will go by the name of the @entity62 , will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display , and a powerful @entity79 processor			2
the @entity60 , by comparison , has a 1136 x 640 resolution , and the @entity83 chip			0
these hardware changes will be in addition to the features of @entity13 's latest @entity88 software , unveiled last week , which include health monitors and smart notifications			0
this latest in a long line of leaks comes as @entity13 chief executive @entity93 and senior vice president of @entity95 , @entity94 , visited @entity13 ’s new campus in @entity97 , @entity98			1
during the tour , the pair told employees to prepare for the ‘ exciting products ’ the company has lined up for this year			1
this was previously teased in an email from @entity93 to employees in @entity107 last year			1
these products could include @entity13 ’s rumoured smartwatch and the @entity110			1
@entity112 blog @entity111 claims this is the rear case of the @entity1 6			0
as well as environmental readings , the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone 's location services in may , @entity112 blog @entity119 said : ' we have just received from our contact in @entity123 a photo of what seems to be the back of an @entity1			2
' we believe the picture to be genuine as we have received leaked product pics in the past that have also proven to be legitimate after official @entity13 product launches			0
' @entity132 phone firm @entity131 then began telling customers @entity13 's @entity1 will launch on 19 september			1
the operator told call centre representatives to let customers know the date in a bid to stop them swapping operators , it has been claimed by @entity140			0
users of @entity1 could have sensors to track altitude , weather and even air pressure , according to code hidden in the @entity88 operating system			0
this image is a screen grab from a video created by @entity152 site nowhereelse.fr			0
it features what is believed to be an industrial model of the @entity29 handset according to @entity158 , however , the date could be little more than an informed guess			0

it was made using an industrial model of the handset believed to have been made to help case and accessory makers ensure their products fit the new design			0
@entity185 media then reported supply - chain sources similarly claiming a 4.7 - inch screen version of the @entity1 will reach stores in august , with a 5.5 - inch or 5.6 - inch model released in september			2
