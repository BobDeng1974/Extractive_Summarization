@entity11 is just one of 24 children in the @entity13 to suffer from @entity14 , a disorder of the nervous system which normally proves fatal by the age of 12			1
his mother @entity18 , 23 , has published a letter written by her son with the help of her and his grandmother in the hope that it may persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in finding a cure for the illness			2
heartbreaking : @entity11 , pictured with his mother @entity27 , suffers from a rare and fatal genetic disorder upset : ms @entity29 spoke out about her son 's condition in the hope that pharmaceutical companies might try and find a cure for the disease tragic : four - year - old @entity11 's condition means that he is unlikely to live beyond the age of 12			1
he is pictured with one of his school teachers she said : ' there is no cure , not even a treatment			1
' it 's basically too rare and not profitable enough for the people who research medications to look into it because there are not enough children like @entity11 in the world to make it worthwhile for them financially			1
' @entity11 will eventually go blind			1
he will lose the ability to walk completely soon			2
he 's not able to feed himself any more			2
he ca n't eat lumps so he will have to be tube fed eventually			2
' children with @entity14 become bed ridden and then die without being able to see or communicate			2
deterioration : @entity11 , pictured with his father @entity58 , was a normal little boy before his diagnosis back in april fundraisers : @entity11 with his mother @entity27 and grandmother @entity61 holding up signs saying thank you to some of those who helped pay for a recent trip to @entity68 with his family ' i have to live every day knowing that my child is going to die and all i can do is watch , there is nothing i can physically do			1
she added : ' as a parent you want nothing more than to protect your children from everything you can and that chance has completely been taken away from me			2
' there are no realistic clinical trials that i can put him on , no doctors that can put him on medication that he has n't already tried			0
' @entity11 was diagnosed with the disorder in april following several months of seizures , thought to be epilepsy , which got progressively worse			1
thank you : @entity11 , pictured , wrote a letter of thank you to those who raised funds for him to go to @entity68 , describing his terrible condition he now also suffers from night terrors , jerks which make him constantly fall over , tremors which mean he ca n't feed himself or play with his toys , and absences where his eyes roll back in his head and he becomes vacant			1
the youngster wanted to write the thank you note after friends and colleagues of @entity11 's grandmother @entity61 , a staff nurse at @entity106 , in @entity107 , and grandfather @entity108 , a black - cab driver , collected over Â£ 1,000 upon hearing of his diagnosis			1
the money went towards sending @entity11 to @entity68 , @entity112 , with his family			1
a local newsagents also raised money while the @entity116 and @entity117 donated money towards the cost of the trip as @entity11 's dad @entity58 is serving with the @entity116			1
rare : the youngster is one of just 24 in the @entity13 diagnosed with the condition @entity27 said of her decision to publish the thank you note : ' i want people to know that there is a childhood disease that has n't got a cure and that every childhood disease should have a cure			1
' it should n't matter how many children suffer from it , there should at least be some sort of treatment for those children to give them a chance			2
' it makes me angry that companies that make billions of pounds through other diseases ca n't even find it in their hearts to at least try to invest into @entity150 disease			0
' these children deserve to have a happy childhood			0
even if i ca n't save my own child i will do all i can to raise enough awareness to save someone else 's child , to save someone else 's family going through what my family is going through			0
' having to think about your child 's funeral before they are five years old is horrible , but it 's the reality - there is nothing in the world that can save him			0
@entity11 's letter ' my name is @entity11 and i am four - and - a - half years old			1
until 12 months i ago i was a normal little boy			2
' i loved playing football and going down the slide in the park and paddling in the sea			0
i was always laughing and loving			0
well , i still am very loving ! ' then i started having fits , lots of different types			0
and i began to have trouble talking and things i could do before i could n't do anymore			0
' the doctor did lots of tests and told my mummy and nana in april that that i have @entity186 , a form of @entity150 disease			0
' it makes me very special because there are only about 20 to 30 children like me in @entity13			1
lots of horrible things are happening to me very quickly now			0
' my hands shake so much i ca n't play with my toys very well and i have to be fed. and i lose my balance all the time so i can only walk a little bit and need to be steadied when i do			0
' i fall over all the time and i get covered in bruises but i rarely cry			0
' and there are lots of things i ca n't eat any more because i choke and i can hardly talk anymore			0
' it cost so much money but i had everything i wanted and more because my nana 's friends at @entity106 had a collection for me and my granddad 's work friends ( he has been a taxi driver for about a hundred years ) also collected lots of money for me			0
' so i just wanted to say a really big thank you to the staff of @entity106 and the taxi drivers and @entity216 at @entity218 newsagents and send you all a big hug			0
