distress : @entity1 suffered a skiing accident with long - term implications for her neurological abilities to the outsider , @entity5 may appear to have an enviable life			1
the bright 44 - year - old has two young sons and a loving husband , not to mention a phd and a high - flying career as a headhunter on her cv			2
but , despite appearances , she is battling a hidden injury that turned her life upside down and forced her to adjust to what is , in her own words , ' a new normal '			0
in april 2010 , on a family ski trip in the @entity23 , @entity5 was knocked over on a nursery slope , suffering a blow to the head that left her briefly unconscious			1
' two men skied straight into me and my instructor			0
i was thrown backwards downhill onto the back of my head with the combined weight of three men on top of me , ' recalls @entity5 , who was wearing a helmet at the time			1
' i was apparently unconscious for about a minute			0
i do n't remember a thing , but got up unaided and was walking and talking , although obviously confused			2
' taken to a nearby medical centre with suspected concussion , @entity5 had her hazy memory prodded by a doctor			1
' i remember a voice needling in my head , asking questions - it was distressing as i did n't know the answers			1
i knew my own name and my family , but little else			0
' but over the next two hours he was satisfied there was improvement in my recall so i was discharged , without referral for a ct scan or any advice - save to take paracetamol			0
' she says the pills were ' like putting a plaster on a car crash victim ' and that night , suffered with ' thunderous pain '			1
' i felt like i 'd been run over by a truck			0
it hurt everywhere , especially my head , and i could n't talk properly because it was painful using my tongue			1
i had no short - term memory so kept asking my exhausted husband @entity67 the same questions			0
' amazingly , @entity5 decided to soldier on , and two days later returned to the slopes , vowing not to let her accident spoil her holiday			1
her memory had slightly improved , although she still felt weak , dizzy , nauseous and in pain			2
back home in @entity76 , @entity77 , she saw an osteopath for the whiplash and damage to her pelvis she had suffered			0
' i thought i 'd improve then			0
but when the physical pain fades , you notice neurological symptoms that are not fading at the same time			1
' among these was impaired cognitive function			0
@entity5 found herself groping for words , lacking concentration and struggling to make decisions or plans			1
' at this point i was a full - time mother , but could n't have gone back to work anyway			2
' in my job i 'd analyse large amounts of information			0
now i could n't finish a newspaper article and reached information overload quickly			2
even reading my son 's ( then five , now seven ) school report was too much - i 'd panic because i could n't understand it			2
cause for concern : one million @entity102 a year go to hospital after bangs on the head ' i 'd be in tears trying to work a new mobile phone			1
having been a touch typist for decades , now i could only do one key at a time			0
' @entity5 felt constantly exhausted , suffered from a chronic headache and developed a stutter when stressed			1
she could n't watch television because light and noise were painful , and regularly felt anxious and tearful			2
' my family were supportive , but i was overwhelmed by the tiniest things - it was like i was holding on to life by my fingertips			0
' despite feeling something was profoundly wrong , it was months before @entity5 received a satisfactory label for her problems			1
visiting a gp shortly after the accident proved fruitless - he dismissed the idea of her having a scan because she was walking and talking			0
five weeks later , suffering from blinding head pain , she saw another gp who referred her for a ct scan			1
' i was on tenterhooks waiting for the results - i wanted proof there was a reason why i felt this way			0
but nothing showed up and i was told i was fine			0
' seven months after the accident , having experienced only a gradual improvement in her symptoms , @entity5 contacted brain injury charity @entity142 and , on their advice , sought a referral to a neurologist			1
' i could n't wait longer so i got a private referral			2
he did tests to decipher my cognitive levels			0
i scored highly , but there were clear gaps in my mental functioning			0
' in my job i 'd analyse large amounts of information			0
now i could n't finish a newspaper article and reached information overload quickly			2
even reading my son 's ( then five , now seven ) school report was too much			0
' ' i had classic damage to my brain 's frontal lobe , which controls things like decision - making , planning and anything that makes it possible to carry on a normal life			2
it was a relief - at last someone believed me			0
' one million @entity102 a year go to hospital after bangs on the head - from minor to life - threatening			1
@entity5 appeared to be suffering from residual effects of mild traumatic brain injury			1
such problems are sometimes called post-concussion syndrome - while symptoms typically resolve within weeks , they can last much longer and sometimes be permanent			1
sometimes people may live with problems for years without connecting them with an old injury			0
these injuries can occur during sport , and due to more everyday knocks - from banging your head against a wall to slipping off a bike			1
those most at risk include young children , young men and the elderly			0
up to 80 per cent of head injuries are thought to fall into the minor category			1
' for some there may be no long - lasting effects , but major consequences can follow seemingly trivial injuries , ' says @entity202 , consultant neurosurgeon and @entity142 trustee			1
' anyone who 's banged their head probably did n't feel perfect for a few minutes			1
it 's not remarkable to have some headache the next day or a few days afterwards			0
but if functioning is abnormal - any problems of speech , communication , vision , cognition , or just finding everything more difficult - the patient may not be able to recognise it			0
' if you feel at all unwell after banging your head , seek help or supervision			2
and if those symptoms persist for more than a few minutes , go to a hospital or doctor to be checked			1
' although @entity5 was not told at the time , returning to the ski slopes after her injury was risky			1
patients are usually advised not to play contact sports for three weeks after a minor head injury			2
post-concussion syndrome : residual effects of mild traumatic brain injury can sometimes last for weeks ' you may be more likely to have a second injury - perhaps because you 're a bit clumsier or have lost insight , ' mr @entity202 says			1
' and if there 's some structural damage in the brain , a second bang on the head may increase the problem			1
' @entity5 's frustration over a lack of diagnosis is not uncommon , and @entity142 wants @entity246 to recognise the sometimes - subtle warning signs			1
mr @entity202 says : ' if someone has fallen and is bleeding from the ear , the doctor will know they need to go to hospital			2
' but if they 're having headaches and trouble concentrating , the doctor may not associate that with a bang to their head last week that they 've neglected to mention			2
' and , as @entity5 found , a brain scan may not identify the ' invisible ' injury she suffered			1
' a ct scan looks for big clots of blood and bits of bone driven in rather than showing that the brain may not be working sensibly , ' says mr @entity202			2
' these patients need to be assessed by someone with relevant skills			0
' such people may have microscopic disturbances that have affected the electrical activity in parts of the brain - sometimes described to the patient as tiny abrasions			2
dr @entity279 , a clinical neuropsychologist who worked for 30 years in brain injury rehabilitation for the @entity281 , says the ' mild ' head injury label can be troublesome because people may have quite severe difficulties afterwards			1
' this can be problematic psychologically , because common - sense thinking is you should recover quickly from mild injuries			0
there can be a vicious cycle of worrying about the symptoms , being unable to get an explanation , and consequently getting more worried			0
' for @entity5 , support from a neurologist and clinical psychologist has helped get her life back on track			1
a further diagnosis of post-traumatic stress allowed her to untangle her psychological symptoms from neurological ones			1
three - and - a - half years on , she 's learned to cope with how her brain now functions			0
' if i forget a word , i take a deep breath and think of another , and i make lists of everything			0
i 'm incredibly lucky - i 've basically recovered			0
but it had a major effect on my life and i wish i 'd had the support i needed sooner			0

one million @entity102 go to hospital a year after bangs on the head
some suffer from post-concussion syndrome
here , residual effects of traumatic brain injuries continue to plague the victim
@entity5 got a concussion from skiing : the physical pain eventually *subsided* but the neurological symptoms did n't *...*
