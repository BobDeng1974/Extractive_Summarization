these striking images show how our hands are riddled with bacteria and viruses from everyday tasks such as picking up an old dishcloth to cleaning a kitchen surface			1
they have been produced as the latest scare tactic to encourage hand washing - therefore reducing the risk of illnesses such as norovirus , @entity14 , colds and flu			0
bacteria from faeces are spread around when people do n’t wash their hands after using the toilet , changing nappies , handling cat litter and similar activities			1
dirty : these images show how bacteria and viruses attach themselves to our hands during everyday tasks we then touch surfaces and then put our hands , and the bugs - including ones that are found in human faeces - into our mouths the photos were created by @entity36 , an expert in infection control at @entity38			1
he touched everyday objects and contaminated foods - or had used the toilet			1
. he then pressed his hands onto a substance that only allows germs from faecal matter to grow			2
he said : ' people may not be aware of how many germs they get on their hands after doing a range of general everyday tasks , so this series of photos really helps to highlight this			1
' an old dishcloth , for example , was riddled with with bugs - more than after using the loo			0
however the images also highlight just how easy it is to get rid of the majority of the bugs with simple soap and water			2
while it does n't totally sterilise the hands ( see images ) , when done properly , basic hand washing greatly reduces contamination mr @entity36 added : ' just as contamination was passed from my hands to the growth surfaces in the pictures , so it could be passed from your hands to your mouth , the food you handle or any other route of infection			1

while it does n't totally sterilise the hands ( see images ) , when done properly , basic hand washing greatly reduces contamination			1
experts warn that not handwashing means just one bacterium can grow into hundreds and thousands in a short space of time mr @entity36 added : ' washing the hands using soap and water is integral to breaking the cycle of transmission of harmful bugs whether that is in a hospital or in our own homes and everyone needs to adopt this very good habit			1
' the images come as new resarch reveals that just two thirds of @entity106 admit to washing their hands after using the loo			2
perhaps unsurprisingly , men are the least thorough with their hand washing - with less than six in ten always washing their hands thoroughly after using the toilet			2
women adopt better hygiene habits with almost three quarters claiming thorough hand washing , according to market analysts @entity117			0
dr @entity118 , director of health protection and medical director at @entity38 , said : ' it is quite shocking to see just how many bacteria we get onto our hands from doing everyday tasks			1
' if we do n’t wash our hands properly then just one bacterium can grow into hundreds and thousands in a relatively short space of time			0
' these are then spread around our environment and onto other people and so on			0
this is why it is so important that we wash our hands thoroughly particularly before preparing food , after handling raw meat and after going to the toilet			2
' the new @entity117 research found that @entity138 pays the least attention to hand washing with 55 per cent failing to follow basic hygiene rules			0
people in @entity143 and @entity144 boast the highest levels of hand hygiene ( 75 per cent )			0
it also highlights low levels of hygiene in many of @entity106 ’s kitchens			0
less than 40 per cent of @entity106 disinfect food preparation surfaces after contact with raw food and even fewer ( 22 per cent ) disinfect food preparation areas before using them .			0

infection control expert @entity36 touched everyday objects
or , he had used the toilet or touched contaminated foods
images show the germs on his hands after performing these activities
if hands are n't washed , the bacteria will be spread and could cause illness
