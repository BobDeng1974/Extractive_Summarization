by @entity0 for @entity1 just as @entity2 used her hair to help her prince up to her castle , a woman from @entity7 is using her own long locks for good - by auctioning them off to raise money for a run - down school			1
@entity16 , from the city of @entity13 in the northern province of @entity15 , lives thousands of miles from the school she is trying to help - but that has not stopped her from feeling inspired to chop off her locks , which drop to a full two metres ( 6ft )			1
the 38 - year - old has been growing her crowning glory for more than 15 years , and once turned down an offer of £ 2,000 to have it cut			1
hair today ... gone tomorrow : @entity16 , 38 , is getting her two - metre long locks chopped off for charity but after hearing about the awful conditions students were enduring at a school in @entity7 , she decided the time was right			1
' i read about the terrible conditions students at a middle school were suffering in the region of @entity35 and thought i had to do something , ' she said			2
' the only thing i have to donate is my hair so i set up an online auction to sell it off to the highest bidder			0
' the bidding has already gone past £ 1,000 , and is not stopping yet			2
let your hair down ! ms @entity16 has been growing her hair for more than 15 years , but is not scared to cut it ms @entity16 added : ' i did n't grow my hair long until i entered university , since female students were n't allowed to grow long hair in high school			1
' my hair grew very quickly and i remember once when i got up to use the bathroom , my waist - long hair seemed to scare other students			0
' i got a bit self conscious about it and later did n't like to walk on the street with it down in case it got too much attention			0
' her beauty regime included no chemical products and just the occasional trim to get rid of split ends			2
' it takes an hour to wash , ten minutes to comb through and a whole day to dry ' she said			0
' the hairdresser used to tell me , " whenever i cut your hair i have to crawl around the floor "			0
' i 'm sure i 'll miss it and i know my husband will but it 's for a good cause and i can always grow it back			0
' completely natural : ms @entity16 does not use any chemical products , and has the odd trim to remove split ends			1
