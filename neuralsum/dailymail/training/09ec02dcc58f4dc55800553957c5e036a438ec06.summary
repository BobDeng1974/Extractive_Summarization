the daughter of singer @entity1 has revealed that she never got over not knowing who her white father was			1
@entity4 , 51 , described how her mother ' carried the scar of her rejection ' throughout her life by both black and white people			0
even when she died in 2008 she did not know who her father was because his name had been censored on a birth certificate given to her 10 years earlier - the first time she learned of her real date of birth			1
@entity1 , pictured performing in 1968 , never knew her father @entity1 was 71 when she was given the document but broke down in tears when her lifelong dream of knowing the identity of her father was shattered			1
this , @entity4 believes , was because he was white and officials wanted to protect him			1
' it was approaching the 21st century and yet they were still protecting the name of the father even though he was clearly dead , ' @entity4 , @entity1 's only child told the @entity31			1
' to some extent , i think my arrival completed her because it gave her a family that she never had , ' she says			0
@entity1 's mother abandoned her when she was a young child and she was raised by various brutal aunts and never forgot ' the beatings , the domestic drudgery , the constant hunger			1
' @entity1 pictured with her daughter @entity1 and then husband @entity43 on one occasion , she was tied to a tree and whipped by @entity46 ' till the blood ran down her legs			1
' soon afterwards , her mother , @entity49 , mysteriously died after eating food ' sprinkled with an unusual pepper ' , although there was never any mention of who might have been responsible for the poisoning			0
the next we know , like an episode in a torrid novel , ' a miraculous event ' occurs and an @entity60 invites @entity1 to live with her in @entity61			1
at school in @entity63 , @entity64 ' acquired a reputation for her singing ability ' - and this was the era of @entity67 and @entity68 and ' the swanky @entity69 , ' of speakeasies and bars , with ' its mix of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity77 - @entity76 cultures			0
' @entity1 soon quarrelled with her guardian , and after another routine beating , moved out			1
' she found herself a job in a sweatshop as a seamstress and a room with a @entity85 family in the @entity86			0
' she was soon engaged by a dance troupe , where she gained notice			0
after dance school , @entity1 sought to make a solo career for herself and @entity91 became a second home for her and her daughter			1
it was only when @entity1 was invited to give a speech at @entity96 in @entity97 , the capital of @entity98 , in 1997 that the singer managed to come to terms with her original home			1
@entity1 sought to make a solo career for herself and @entity91 became a second home for her and her daughter during that same speech an attendee asked @entity1 about her past and about her parents , as she was from that part of town			1
@entity1 then confessed she had tried to find her birth certificate in the 50s , but had no luck			1
this re-ignited @entity1 's curiosity about herself			2
after some digging around , a piece of information led her back down to the @entity98			0
in the next seven months , @entity1 and @entity4 hired a lawyer and started a petition to get the court to open her records			2
they finally allowed @entity1 to see them , but only for 15 minutes			2
' she was very nervous and outside the judge 's chambers she went quiet			0
she was visibly nervous about what she was going to see ... it was a female judge who stepped aside while we read the records on her desk			0
the father 's name was blacked out			2
my mother shed a few tears and then the 15 minutes was up , ' says @entity4 , who worked for her mother for more than 20 years			0
the singer with her model daughter @entity1 in 1999 , a year after the pair found @entity1 's birth certificate on that day it was also revealed @entity1 had never known her birth date			1
while she has always put january 26 1926 on her passport , the certificate revealed she was actually a year younger , born january 17 1927			0
@entity4 says her mother never really felt comfortable in her own skin because she never really knew who she was until then			0
she believes that this failure to find out her mother 's origins explains her tortured relationship with the @entity98 and her own identity			0
@entity1 passed away on christmas day 2008 , never knowing her father 's name at that time , being a light - skinned black person in the black @entity98 was ' just as bad ' as black person in the white @entity98			1
@entity1 was not accepted by the black community and was referred to as a ' yellow gal ' ( someone who thought they were better than everyone else ) from a child			2
for @entity1 , born in 1927 in ' a ramshackle arrangement of backwoods shacks ' in the @entity98 cotton fields , being born black or of mixed race was like being a @entity168 in @entity169			2
you were not quite human			0
@entity1 , indeed , had not thought of herself as ' coloured ' until she was made to enter restaurants by the back door			2
even in the @entity174 she had difficulty buying property in @entity177 , because @entity178 and @entity179 were neighbourhoods that ' did n’t welcome @entity77 - @entity76 home - owners			0
' when her close friend @entity183 used a hotel swimming pool , it was ' drained and scrubbed by a cleaning crew the next morning			0
' @entity1 ’s parentage was uncertain			2
her father was white - but who was he ? possibly one of the @entity49 family , ' the former slave owners , ' or , far more likely , a recently bereaved local doctor called @entity193			0
indeed , @entity194 , the author of a biography called @entity76 's mistress : @entity1 , @entity197 , believed @entity1 's father was @entity193 , though @entity4 says ' there were a lot of names ' .			1

@entity203 and *actress* @entity1 never knew who her white father was
she went to retrieve her birth certificate in 1998 at 71 , with daughter @entity208
@entity211 when she saw officials had ' blacked out ' his name , ' protecting ' him
