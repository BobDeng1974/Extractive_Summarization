by @entity0 last updated at 7:27 am on 27th january 2012 last year 's @entity1 was a modest update for @entity3 's flagship smartphone - but insiders at @entity3 's factories say that a new handset will offer a bigger screen and different form factor sources inside @entity3 's @entity11 supplier @entity10 have said that a new @entity1 will have a four inch - or larger - screen			1
several samples of the device are already under test , says the ' reliable ' source , speaking to @entity3 blog @entity17			2
the rumour would lend credibility to the idea that @entity3 is plotting a summer launch for its new handset			0
if the company is at the prototype stage already , launch could be very soon			0
the final model has not been selected , but all of them are significantly different from the @entity1 and @entity1			2
none have the ' teardrop ' shape that some @entity3 - watchers predicted for the new model			1
' the source said various sample devices are also floating around - they vary slightly from one another - so it is impossible to tell which one will be the final , ' said @entity41			0
the four - inch screen has been one of the most persistent rumours about @entity3 's upcoming smartphone - and would make sense , as it would take @entity3 's flagship device into line with rivals such as @entity51 's @entity50			1
the relatively modest update last year from @entity1 to @entity1 means that most @entity3 - watchers agree that a new model is inevitable - and many point to this summer for a likely launch date			1
the upcoming ' redesign ' of @entity3 's @entity1 was rumoured to have been personally overseen by late ceo @entity59 sources inside @entity3 accessory companies also say that @entity62 will not be an overhaul of the product , with cases and other accessories at the same size as ones for @entity69			1
that would leave the stage clear for a ' big ' overhaul of @entity1 this summer			0
at an earnings call this week , chief executive @entity73 , who replaced @entity3 founder @entity59 hinted at future gadgets , which are rumoured to include a march release of the @entity69 3 and a possible @entity1 update			2
he said : ' @entity3 's momentum is incredibly strong , and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline			2
' @entity3 ceo @entity73 said this week , ' @entity3 's momentum is incredibly strong , and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline			1
' and the group reported record quarterly revenues of $ 46.33billion ( £ 29.7 billion ) , up from $ 26.74billion ( £ 17.1 billion ) a year earlier			0
the stellar results sent the shares 6 per cent or $ 27 higher to almost $ 448 today			0
