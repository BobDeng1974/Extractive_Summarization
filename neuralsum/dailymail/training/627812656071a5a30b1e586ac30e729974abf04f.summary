@entity0 : the author had extensive files kept on him by @entity3 he is fondly remembered as the author of @entity5 , a tale of lakes and boats that was one of the best - loved children ’s books of the 20th century			1
but nearly 100 years ago @entity0 was accused of less innocent writings - with @entity3 suspecting he was a @entity12 spy			1
@entity14 secret agents considered him an ardent @entity15 and believed he was ‘ a man who paints @entity12 as a paradise on earth ’			1
details of @entity0 ’s ‘ harmful ’ political activities are among 150 top secret @entity3 files opened during the @entity22 which are available online today for the first time			1
hand - written and typed intelligence reports , postcards and photographs of people and organisations involved in espionage were digitised by the @entity30			0
@entity0 enchanted generations of children with his stories happy families , holidays and not - very - dangerous adventures			2
but today ’s files show the @entity14 government ’s agents and spies had concerns about the @entity44 - educated writer ’s true motives			2
despite being on the payroll of @entity47 - to gather intelligence against @entity12 , the security services believed he could be an enemy of the state and a supporter of @entity15 revolution			1
as foreign correspondent for the now - defunct @entity53 , @entity0 witnessed the @entity54 and became friendly with @entity55 , founder of the @entity15 , and @entity57 , leader of the @entity58			1
he also had an affair with @entity57 ’s secretary , @entity60 , and eventually married her in 1924 after helping her emigrate from @entity12 because she was ‘ exposed to danger ’ after helping @entity3			1
one typed military intelligence report , published online today , from july 1918 concludes that ‘ @entity0 has applauded the @entity15 to such an extent in his newspaper writing that one is almost forced to a conclusion that he is a @entity15 himself			1
’ then in october 1918 an @entity3 file notes that @entity0 , at the time living in @entity69 , had ‘ considerable influence ’ with the @entity71			1
during his time as a foreign correspondent , @entity0 became friendly with @entity55 , left , and @entity57 , right , two of the key architects of the @entity75 a @entity77 minister , @entity76 , warned that he was ‘ continuing his propaganda work ’ against @entity14			1
he noted @entity0 had told friends in @entity12 he could ‘ persuade the @entity15 that they may count on a large measure of support from the working classes in @entity83 ’ in the event of revolution			1
he arrived back in the @entity14 in early - 1919 but then applied to return to @entity12 as correspondent for the @entity87			1
a scrawled handwritten note from that april cautions that if @entity0 is to be permitted to go back ‘ can we take him out of all anti-bolshevik theatres of operation			2
if the decision to attempt to do so is final [ we ] must take action without delay			0
’ but on august 16 , brigadier general @entity96 said in a despatch to sir @entity98 at the @entity99 that it would be ‘ most undesirable for a @entity14 subject who holds such views as @entity0 does to go to @entity12			1
i should say he would do less harm in this country			0
’ meanwhile , the @entity30 files reveal concerns over the relationship between the @entity14 scout movement - more often associated with camping and knot - tying - and their counterparts in @entity113 the aftermath of the @entity22 relations between scouts in the two countries were hostile			2
letters from 1919 show that there were objections to @entity122 scouts attending the international jamboree in @entity124 the following year			0
a letter from the @entity126 states : ‘ the attitude of the @entity128 is that they will certainly not have any @entity130 here next year at their international show at @entity124			0
’ the files also reveal fears that the @entity135 was being infiltrated by @entity136 during the @entity22			0
the files reveal fears that the @entity130 was being infiltrated by @entity136 during the @entity22 in a case of ‘ red under the camp beds ’ , correspondence from 1920 shows that enquiries were made about the ‘ red boy scout movement ’ and its influence in @entity14			2
investigations showed ‘ no record of any such movement ’ but fears resurfaced in 1954 when a 19 - year - old @entity148 was thrown out of the organisation because he was a member of the @entity152 ’s @entity151			0
@entity155 , a scout from the age of eight , was accused of conducting ‘ anti-religious propaganda ’ and was forced to leave the movement			0
the file says of mr @entity155 : ‘ not only has he been found inspired by communist ideas , but to be a high - ranked communist leader as well , who as such made oath to conduct anti-religious propaganda			0
‘ @entity163 declared , that @entity164 could not keep his scout ’s pledge , as the first article of this reads : “ i hearby solemnly promise earnestly to try to do my duty towards @entity170 and my country			0
” ‘ in the opinion of the @entity163 the question had nothing to do with politics ’ the point , however , was whether a scout can keep a promise , when he is a communist			0
’ the files are part of the @entity30 ’ first world war 100 programme of digitised releases and events to mark the centenary of the 1914 - 18 conflict			0
they contain details of spies around the world , including @entity14 nurse @entity191 who was executed by the @entity122 for saving captured soldiers and @entity193 , the notorious female spy and entertainer			2
@entity30 records specialist dr @entity196 said : ‘ the files in the @entity30 ’ collection reveal the importance of the security service in safeguarding the nation during the @entity22			0
