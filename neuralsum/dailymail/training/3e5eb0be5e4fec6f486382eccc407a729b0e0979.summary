toilet humour usually always gets a few laughs - but the victim of this prank really did n't see the funny side			2
in an effort to win an ongoing prank war , a @entity6 woman sprayed her boyfriend @entity10 's toilet roll with pepper spray in the hope of burning his backside			1
talking to the camera before the prank unfolded the woman explains that she is ' sick of pranks on me ' , and that ' today it will be my revenge '			2
but the reaction she got once he had was far from amused			0
after emerging from the bathroom , holding his bum , @entity10 keels over in pain , asking repeatedly , ' what is it ? '			2
eventually he simply lays on his side while clutching his bum and moaning , as his girlfriend chortles in the background			0
his girlfriend then explains that she pepper sprayed the toilet paper , to which he responds , ' what kind of prank is this ? ' as @entity10 writhes in pain , his girlfriend continues to point the camera at him , to which he replies : ' do n't film me			1
go away ! ' her boyfriend , @entity10 , hobbles out of the bathroom , clutching his bum with his hands while moaning in pain @entity10 pleads for his girlfriend to stop filming ; when she does n't he slides into the wardrobe to hide his girlfriend then offers him ice to ease the burning , as he desperately asks her ' do you think it will help ? ' the woman then gleefully reveals that she had earlier sprayed the ice with pepper spray as well after telling @entity10 not to ' overreact ' his girlfriend follows him to the shower where she continues to film him as he uses a detachable shower head to spray water on his backside he then slithers into a closet and pulls the door shut behind him			1
viewers of the video might assume @entity10 's girlfriend then experiences some pangs of guilt , as she 's seen getting her beau some ice cubs from the fridge			1
but after he applies them to his burning backside , and the pain seemingly escalates , she reveals she has also sprayed them with pepper spray			1
to top it off , she then tells @entity10 not to ' overreact '			0
@entity10 then escapes to the bathroom where he climbs into the shower fully clothed			0
while sitting on the floor he uses a detachable shower head to ease his suffering			0
despite his pleas for privacy , his girlfriend never stops filming .			0
