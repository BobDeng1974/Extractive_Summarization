@entity1 wining defender @entity0 has dealt @entity2 a blow in their attempt to sign him by insisting he is happy at @entity5			1
@entity6 is thought to be interested in signing the centre back as he looks to patch up his leaky defence in the january transfer window			1
but the @entity11 @entity1 winner said although he saw the interest as a compliment , and accepted that he could earn more money with a move away from @entity5 , he has no intention of leaving the club			1
@entity0 challenges @entity18 as @entity5 lost for the third time this season ' it 's nice to hear that big clubs like that are interested in you , ' @entity0 told @entity24			1
' i take that as a compliment			0
' but it does n't influence me in any way , otherwise			0
we earn enough here in @entity5			1
' there will always be someone who can pay more than @entity5			1
but @entity5 have made a lot of progress in my time here			2
' in any case , i believe that 's enough for me			0
if one day i start thinking about playing abroad , money wo n't be the reason			0
' but i do n't even think about that at the moment			0
we still have so much further to go here			0
' the @entity11 defender says he owes his development to @entity5 and does n't want to leave @entity0 played a big part in @entity11 's @entity1 success , scoring against @entity49 in the quarter - finals @entity0 has been at @entity5 since 2008 , winning the @entity24 twice as well as helping @entity52 's side reach the @entity54 final in 2013			1
and the @entity11 defender insisted that the club 's stature as one of the smaller outfits among @entity60 's elite makes the successes all the more satisfying			2
' i 've been here for six and a half years and it 's simply more exciting and more difficult to win trophies as an underdog			0
' everybody can win things with 25 superstars in the squad			0
at @entity5 , every single player has more responsibility but also more opportunity			2
' it 's difficult to win trophies with @entity5 but it 's always possible			2
and when it happens , the feeling is simply indescribable			0
' @entity2 are hoping to sign the @entity1 winning star but the player is happy where he is			1

@entity0 wanted by @entity6 to *bolster* his defence
but @entity0 is happy to stay with @entity85 club
' there will always be someone who can pay more ' admits @entity89
but despite the ' compliment ' of interest from @entity2 and @entity94 , defender insists he is not ready to leave @entity5
