he was loved for his delicate prints and colourful textiles but there was more to artist @entity4 than a charming way with wallpaper			1
indeed , as a groundbreaking new exhibition on the @entity9 painter reveals , @entity4 was not only a socialist firebrand who almost single handedly sparked the arts and crafts movement , he also had decidedly risqué tastes in gardening implements			1
included in @entity16 : @entity4 and his legacy is a set of gardening tools created by sculptor @entity20 which are guaranteed to raise an eyebrow or two			1
risqué : sculptor @entity20 is behind this rather naughty garden roller which shows @entity25 based on the story of @entity25 , the roller created for @entity28 shows the biblical couple in a rather compromising position			1
@entity31 , now disgraced after being revealed to be both incestuous and overly fond of the family dog , was a friend of @entity4 ' and shared his left - wing politics			2
but eye - opening though @entity31 's designs are , it is @entity4 who proved to be the most radical as the diaries and copy of @entity41 's @entity40 included in the collection make plain			1
none of this comes as a surprise to curator and cultural historian @entity47 , who says @entity4 believed that ' beauty was a basic human birthright ' and as such , art should be available to everyone - including him			2
so , and in spite of his membership of the @entity54 , @entity4 was n't immune to the odd vanity project , including encasing his copy of @entity40 in gold			1
on display : @entity31 's roller takes pride of place in the @entity63 's new @entity4 exhibition portrait of a painter : @entity4 pictured towards the end of his life in 1887 ( left ) and right , as a young man ' only @entity4 would encase @entity41 in a gold - tooled binding , ' adds @entity47			1
' it was part of his religion of nothing but the best – not for the elitist connoisseur but nothing but the best for the whole populace			0
' despite his lofty ideals , much of @entity4 ' work ended up on the walls of the @entity82 elite , although his ' art for everyone ' philosophy made him enormously popular			2
and that was n't the only way in which he showed off his left - wing credentials			0
like many other intellectuals of the time , @entity4 was fond of the mandal , an example of which is included in the exhibition			0
dating from 1880 , the sandals became popular in the @entity96 following a visit to @entity98 by @entity4 ' friend , philosopher @entity99			0
' @entity99 was the man who introduced the sandal to left - wing circles , ’ reveals @entity47			0
‘ they became a kind of cult among left - leaning middle - class intellectuals			0
' family : @entity4 ( top left ) with his glamorous wife @entity107 ( bottom right ) and sir @entity109 ( centre ) striking : @entity4 ' beautiful wife @entity111 - or @entity107 as she was also known - regularly appeared in artworks pretty : @entity4 is famous for his pretty garden - inspired wallpaper and textile designs but the @entity63 exhibition , which opens this week , is n't only about @entity4 , his mandals and his risqué taste in gardening tools			1
among the 140 artefacts to star in the exhibition is a beautiful portrait of @entity4 ' wife @entity111 as well as a striking peacock brooch made as part of the arts and crafts craze sparked by @entity4 and his friends			1
other highlights include striking pieces by @entity132 and @entity133 , as well as furniture and jewellery that belonged to @entity4 himself			2
‘ in the 21st century , our art and design culture is widespread , ' adds @entity47			0
' but its global sophistication brings new anxieties			0
' we find ourselves returning to many of @entity4 ’s preoccupations with craft skills and the environment , with local sourcing , with vernacular traditions , with art as a vital force within society , binding together people of varying backgrounds and nationalities			0
' this exhibition , as i see it , will not only explore what @entity4 ’s vision was but will suggest ways in which his radical thinking still affects the way we live our lives ’ .			0
