by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 12:23 est , 10 december 2012 generous benefactors who lent treasures to a @entity4 museum have discovered they may have been sold by the museum which has since closed			1
the relics were loaned to the @entity4 and @entity7 as part of an exhibition telling the story of @entity4 's colonial heritage			1
but it has now emerged that 144 items are unaccounted for and at least one , a 19th century maritime oil painting belonging to @entity15 , has been sold for £ 61,000			1
sold : this painting of the @entity18 's ship @entity19 passing @entity20 was sold at @entity21 trustees of the museum , which has now closed , are currently in talks with eight owners about compensation			1
the embarrassing situation appears to have arisen from a mix - up over whether the items were given or just loaned to the museum in @entity31			2
lord @entity15 said he had only learnt of the sale after he asked for the painting to be returned following his father 's death			1
he said : ' i contacted the museum and asked , " could we have the painting back ? " and unfortunately , they said " no , this painting was given to the museum "			1
' we subsequently discovered it had been sold by @entity21 on behalf of the museum			1
' i said " no , this is not right because we have a document here that clearly shows it was loaned to the museum , not given "			2
' now closed : the former @entity48 at @entity49 , @entity31 , shut in 2008 relics of former glory : the museum was set up to tell the story of @entity4 's colonial past lord @entity15 said his later father had loaned the painting to the museum , which opened in @entity59 's original @entity49 station in 2002			1
the artwork depicts the @entity18 ship , the @entity62 , and was painted by sailor - turned - artist @entity64 - @entity15 's great , great grandfather who captained the ship			1
the artwork was sold at auction by @entity21 to the government of @entity70 island @entity71 - pictured in the background - when the museum closed in 2008			1
telling our story : plans to move the museum to @entity78 fell through lord @entity15 said : ' i suppose the museum is to blame , because they did n't have a proper stock check and maybe somebody in the museum went , shall we say , off - piste rather than follow all the correct procedures			2
' the situation was exposed in an investigation by the @entity89 's @entity91 programme , to be aired tonight			0
@entity92 , which is in charge of the museum 's exhibits after its closure in 2008 , said they could not say how many items were missing because they did not have a full audit to compare the past and present collections			0
however the museum 's trustees revealed that 144 loan items were still unaccounted for			1
the latest accounts for the museum show that former director , @entity105 , had undertaken a number of ' unauthorised transactions ' but said there was no suggestion anyone had made personal profits from the sales			0
@entity105 , who was dismissed in february 2011 , insisted that the care and security of the collection was the trustees ' responsibility			0
he added that any objects were disposed of with the knowledge and agreement of the trustees and that the receipts were fully audited			0
he said : ' i never benefited from any sales of material and will regard any such inference as actionable			0
' the @entity89 programme also traced several other items that went missing from a collection gifted to the museum in 2003 by the former @entity130			0
one item , a statuette of @entity133 , the founder of @entity134 in @entity135 , was sold alongside others by an unknown dealer			1
a report by the @entity139 , which investigated claims that the statue and other items were being sold by a dealer in @entity78 , said the trader took about 150 items and paid the museum £ 115,000			1
missing : @entity92 is now in charge of the former museum 's exhibits the trader has since returned some items including the statue			0
sir @entity153 , who took over as chairman of the board of trustees , said there was no authorisation for the sales and the trustees had not known			0
he said : ' there was no authorisation at all of any of the material that went to the @entity78 dealer and certainly not of the @entity62 painting			2
' these are items that went from our possession without the knowledge or the authority of the trustees and a large part of the time the trustees have been spending since our director was dismissed has been trying to get to the bottom of those issues			0
' the difficulty is that trustees are not generally speaking in the day - to - day management and operation of the enterprise for which they are trustees			0
' and in our case we delegated to a responsible , paid director with some staff and all the indications were that this was a professional doing a professional job			0
' he added that it was fair to say that ' dozens ' of items were unaccounted for , but also admitted that the total may never be known precisely			2
the museum opened in 2002 in @entity59 's original @entity49 station and won a string of awards			0
however the museum struggled to attract enough visitors to make it financially viable , and plans to rescue it by moving it to @entity78 fell through			0
the site in @entity31 was chosen because of the historic connection with the empire , through voyages of exploration , trade - including slavery - piracy , shipbuilding and the railways .			2
