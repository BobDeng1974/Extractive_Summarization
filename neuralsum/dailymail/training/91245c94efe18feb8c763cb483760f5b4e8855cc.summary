middle school students in @entity1 will now have access to condoms after a spike in local pregnancies prompted administrators to revisit their sexual education policies			1
the @entity8 has passed a rule that will specify certain teachers to hand out condoms to students when the students ask for them			1
' if they wanted a condom , they would have to meet with a teacher - a designated teacher , the sex ed teacher , or some of our counselors and maybe some administrators , ' the local superintendent @entity14 told @entity24			0
spike in pregnancies : the new rule comes after 7 per cent of the young girls at @entity8 became pregnant over the course of the last academic year should teachers be allowed to give middle school students condoms ? should teachers be allowed to give middle school students condoms ? now share your opinion ' there would be designated people for students to have a conversation with and then a condom would be distributed at that time			1
' school administrators feel that by forcing the students to talk to a teacher about the issue in order to get the condoms will help as opposed to just leaving the condoms somewhere out in the open for students to take without any supervision			2
addressing the issue : superintendent @entity52 said that the policy will force students to speak to teachers before getting the condoms the new rule comes after 7 per cent of the young girls at @entity8 became pregnant over the course of the last academic year			1
that number has dropped slightly this year to 5 per cent - which equate to nine girls between sixth and 12th grade - even though the policy will not go into effect until next year			2
in the @entity8 south of @entity65 , the high school and middle school are run separately , but that did n't stop the administrators from extending the new rule to both			0
' i think the concern was that if we have our middle school , we have some of the same teachers teaching the same topics at the high school , obviously there 's going to be a different type of curriculum for the middle school , but at some point they just kind of felt it would evolve to that anyway - so let 's just include them ( sixth graders ) , ' mr @entity14 told @entity24			0
he also noted that the middle school is only 40 feet away from the high school			0
parents are split on the issue , with some board members - who voted to approve the rule - noting that it will lead to more constructive conversations about sex while others think that it is unnecessary to make it available to children at such a young age			0

@entity8 and @entity97 have a new policy that means students can talk to specific teachers and then be given condoms
comes after there was a spike in teen pregnancies
will go into effect next school year
