by @entity0 in the week @entity3 were hit with a potentially crippling law suit over football ’s ‘ negligent ’ handling of head injuries , the world governing body have launched a mental - health research project			1
the class action suit , filed last wednesday by a group of parents and players in @entity13 , alleges football ’s governing body have acted ‘ carelessly ’ and ‘ recklessly ’ in their management of head injuries — a move which could have far - reaching implications for the sport			1
the filing reads : ‘ @entity3 presides over this [ concussion ] epidemic and is one of its primary causes			0
’ injured : this summer ’s @entity26 in @entity27 was blighted by cases where players carried on with the game succumbing : @entity32 ’s @entity31 was eventually taken off in the final but initially kept playing this summer ’s @entity26 in @entity27 was blighted by a spate of cases where players — including @entity32 ’s @entity31 in the final — were allowed to play on after suffering concussion			1
last season ’s @entity41 also saw a number of alarming cases , one of which involved @entity45 goalkeeper @entity46 , where medics were over-ruled by management desperate to return players to the field			1
earlier this month the @entity52 ’s head of medicine , dr @entity51 , told the @entity55 football could face a ‘ tsunami ’ of damaging legal claims if it fails to radically improve its protocols			0
@entity51 ’s prediction appears to be coming true in the @entity61			0
the so - called ‘ soccer moms ’ lawsuit is not seeking financial compensation but is looking for rule changes which allow for adequate time for off - field assessment while limiting the number of headers allowed by children under 17			0
symptoms such as depression , increased aggression levels and increased risk of suicide have all been linked to repeated concussions , and @entity3 ’s investigation into mental health issues in football appears to be in response to the lawsuit			2
adamant : @entity45 goalkeeper @entity46 overruled his medics and played on despite his injury dazed : @entity46 is led off by medical staff but returned to the action soon after and did not want to go off back : @entity46 , against his medical advisers ' wishes , came back on the field after sustaining a head injury ‘ any scientific data on the mental health of athletes is rare , and almost no scientific study has yet investigated the mental health among football players , ’ the statement read			1
‘ to respond to this gap in knowledge , @entity3 has established the new research area , so that those in the game feel more comfortable coming forwards to talk about issues and in order to ease access to treatment			0
’ last week a group of sports medics — including representatives from the @entity111 , @entity3 , the @entity112 and @entity113 — met in @entity114 to discuss what some have termed a ‘ concussion crisis ’			0
‘ @entity3 ’s decision to start research into mental health issues in the same week as a law suit is filed may be coincidence , ’ said one attendee			2
‘ there appears to be so little understanding of head injuries within the organisation they may not even have realised the link			2
