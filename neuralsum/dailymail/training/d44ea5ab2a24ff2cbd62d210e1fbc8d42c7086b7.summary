by @entity0 published : 17:46 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 23 april 2013 under fire : education minister @entity3 's claim that nurseries are too ' chaotic ' has already outraged teaching unions and childcare providers @entity3 risked a fresh clash with nursery chiefs yesterday by saying a third of children start school without basic language and communication skills			1
the education minister ’s claim that nurseries are too ‘ chaotic ’ has already outraged teaching unions and childcare providers			1
but yesterday she told @entity18 there was clear evidence that toddlers who took part in structured sessions led by a graduate were better prepared for primary school			0
‘ it is a very sad fact that 33 per cent of children arrive at school without the requisite communication and language skills to take part in school education , ’ she said			0
in an interview with the @entity37 , the minister , who is increasingly tipped for a @entity35 post , said too many childcare settings were ‘ chaotic ’ and saw children ‘ running around ’ with ‘ no sense of purpose ’			1
she praised a traditional approach akin to @entity44 ’s écoles maternelles , which studies suggest are more effective academically and produce better adjusted , happier children			1
her remarks came after @entity49 ’s chief inspector sir @entity48 said failing pre-schools face closure if they do not improve quickly			0
@entity53 mps urged miss @entity3 to ‘ stick to her guns ’ yesterday			1
one , @entity55 , urged her to ‘ continue her drive to improve standards in our nurseries ’			1
miss @entity3 told the @entity61 that ‘ countries like @entity44			1
have much higher salaries and higher qualifications in early years			0
‘ at the moment , only one third of nurseries have a teacher - led structure , ’ she said			2
‘ good providers have high - quality , structured learning from age three which really benefits later on			0
’ @entity72 : miss @entity3 told @entity18 there was clear evidence that toddlers who took part in structured sessions led by a graduate were better prepared for primary school ( file picture ) miss @entity3 ’s intervention drew an angry response from trade union @entity83			1
its head of education @entity86 said : ‘ this unwarranted attack on “ unruly nurseries ” suggests @entity3 would rather that children were seen but not heard			1
‘ whilst claiming it wants to boost standards , the government ’s plans to reduce the ratio of staff to children in nurseries will have a disastrous impact			2
’ tough : her remarks came after @entity49 's chief inspector sir @entity48 said failing pre- schools face closure if they do not improve quickly @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ‘ it is frankly astonishing that the minister in charge of childcare makes such ill - judged , off - the - cuff statements			1
' the picture the minister paints is not one that would be recognised by anyone who knows anything about child development			2
day nurseries are not hothouses of anarchy , as the minister seems to believe			2
‘ what she sees as the ideal @entity44 model is regarded by many @entity44 practitioners themselves as dull , and uninspiring for children			2
‘ young children are by nature active , energetic and inquisitive			0
it is these features that good - quality nursery staff nurture and develop through a balance of child - oriented and adult - led activities			0
’ @entity134 , a registered childminder who runs @entity137 in @entity138 , said : ‘ i find it rather annoying – no , very annoying – that the early years minister can go on and on and on about early years practitioners needing higher qualifications , needing to do x , y and z to improve outcomes for children – when she herself does not have any formal qualification in early years childcare			0
’ but @entity151 , head of the @entity152 in @entity153 , which operates one of the country ’s biggest nursery and primary facilities , backed miss @entity3 , saying : ‘ we see nursery school as exactly that – a school , a place to learn			2
‘ the early years in a child ’s life are so important for their educational development			0
that ’s why we employ qualified teachers at our early years centre , who deliver structured and engaging lessons to children from age three			0
‘ and the model works : children at @entity177 , in a socially disadvantaged area of @entity153 , exceed national averages by the time they are in year one			0

@entity3 's *criticism* of ' chaotic ' nurseries has outraged unions
she praised a traditional approach akin to @entity44 's écoles maternelles
@entity53 mps *including* @entity55 urged minister to ' stick to her guns '
