intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the @entity3 jihadi who led the executions of 21 @entity6 was an @entity8 recruit			1
the militant , who spoke @entity10 with a @entity8 accent , appeared in a horrific video on sunday showing the beheadings of a group of @entity15 on a beach in @entity17			1
brandishing a knife , he declares : ' all crusaders ... the sea you have hidden sheikh @entity23 's body in , we swear to @entity25 we will mix it with your blood			0
' the men are then forced to lie face - down before they are beheaded simultaneously			0
@entity8 officials are understood to be analysing the militant 's facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the @entity36 executioner known as @entity37 , who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in @entity40			1
another @entity8 specialist , who asked not to be named told @entity60 that he may be a native @entity57 speaker who learned @entity10 by spending ' a significant amount of time ' in @entity8			1
the suggestion he may have been radicalised in the @entity8 comes as the @entity65 administration faced heavy criticism for suggesting that defeating @entity3 requires more of a jobs program for terrorists than a sophisticated approach to killing them			1
@entity73 spokesman @entity72 said monday night on @entity74 that ' we can not win this war by killing them , we can not kill our way out of this war			0
' instead , she said , the administration should ' go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups ' – including ' lack of opportunity for jobs			0
' ' we can work with countries around the world to help improve their governance , ' @entity72 insisted			0
' we can help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people			0
' the embarrassing gaffe aired as the @entity96 attracted new criticism for papering over religious aspects of a mass - beheading of @entity15 by the @entity3 terror army			1
executed : at least 35 more @entity6 are believed to have been kidnapped by jihadists in @entity17 , raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution like the one seen on sunday when the @entity104 released a horrific video showing the beheading of 21 @entity107 on a beach ( above ) similar analysis has been underway in an attempt to identify the @entity36 executioner known as @entity37 ( above with @entity114 hostage @entity112 ) who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in @entity40 @entity96 press secretary @entity117 issued a 192 - word reaction condemning the brutal killings as ' despicable ' and ' cowardly ' but made no mention of the religion of the killers or their victims			1
the words ' @entity125 , ' ' @entity124 ' and ' @entity127			0
' were not included in @entity117 's statement			0
a @entity131 / @entity130 poll found 57 per cent of @entity8 disapprove of how president @entity65 is handling the threat posed by @entity3			1
even among @entity133 , 46 per cent say @entity8 's battle with @entity3 is going badly			1
public approval of the administration 's @entity137 efforts has slipped by 8 percentage points since september			0
part of that slide may be due to the @entity73 's focus on what conservatives deride as ' hashtag diplomacy ' – a program of pushback through social media designed to strip away @entity3 's glamourous appeal to would - be jihadis			1
vice president @entity151 has also called for immigrants to be fully included in the fabric of @entity8 society to prevent violent ideologies from taking root at home as he opened a @entity96 summit on countering extremism and radicalisation			1
joining local elected officials , community leaders and religious figures , @entity151 portrayed the @entity8 as far better positioned than @entity165 , thanks to what he called @entity8 's successful record at cultural integration			1
under fire : @entity73 spokeswoman @entity72 insisted a jobs program could stem the tide of @entity3 creeping influence : the @entity104 is cementing a foothold in @entity17 where the latest beheadings took place he said societies must offer immigrants an ' affirmative alternative ' to extremism , cautioning that military force alone could not address the threat			1
across the @entity188 , deadly terrorist attacks in @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 have left @entity165 feeling vulnerable to the type of violent ideology promoted by the @entity104 group and once thought to be confined mostly to the @entity192 and @entity193			0
' national security flows from a sense of community , ' @entity151 said , adding that the most important lesson the @entity8 can learn is that ' inclusion counts			2
' the @entity96 has sought to use the three - day conference in @entity200 to stir a sense of urgency about the challenge of preventing home - grown terrorism and the radicalization and recruitment of @entity8 , particularly disaffected young people			2
yet it comes as the @entity65 administration has struggled to match its stated strategy for fighting is and other @entity45 extremist groups with the realities on the ground in @entity17 , @entity214 and other @entity192 hotspots			0
on wednesday , president @entity65 was to address a gathering at the @entity96 examining the response from @entity8 cities , then speak at the @entity73 on thursday at a gathering of representatives from roughly 60 countries			2
@entity36 , @entity223 , @entity6 , the @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity185 are expected to attend			2
global concerns that the @entity104 is drawing interest and support from communities far away from @entity230 and @entity40 have only grown in recent days			0
as well as @entity6 and @entity17 , @entity187 is reeling from a weekend shooting spree by a 22 - year - old gunman that authorities believe may have been radicalized in prison			2
@entity151 , in his remarks , held up @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 as examples of communities moving ahead with programs to counter extremism locally			0
he said the goal was to bring together broad coalitions of community leaders so that all @entity8 - and particularly @entity127 - would feel like ' we see them			2
' ' we have n't always gotten it right , ' @entity151 said			0
' but we have a lot of experience integrating communities into the @entity8 system , the @entity8 dream			2
