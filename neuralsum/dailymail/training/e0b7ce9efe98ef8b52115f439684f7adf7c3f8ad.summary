by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 10:03 est , 15 january 2014 a grieving mother is suing the @entity3 after a locum doctor refused to give her a scan when her unborn baby was in distress			1
@entity8 , 26 , was 39 weeks pregnant when a midwife was concerned her bump had not grown so booked her in for an emergency scan at the hospital			1
but when she arrived at @entity14 , locum consultant dr @entity13 told her there were no slots available and examined her before sending her home			1
@entity8 ( pictured with her partner , @entity18 ) is suing the @entity3 after her baby was stillborn just days after a locum doctor told her she did n't need an emergency scan four days later a gp examined ms @entity8 and discovered her baby had died in the womb			1
she was forced to give birth to her dead daughter @entity25 on april 26 , 2012			1
following the death , the @entity26 , which runs the hospital , carried out a full investigation which revealed six key failings			0
they included ms @entity8 not being referred for a scan , staff not having adequate training and poor communication between the midwife and dr @entity13			1
ms @entity8 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , is convinced that had she had undergone the scan on april 20 , her baby could have been saved			1
she said : ‘ i know that @entity25 could have been saved if the problems had been detected earlier			2
instead i had to go through the worst experience of my life , something which no one should go through			0
when ms @entity8 was 39 weeks pregnant , a midwife became concerned her baby had stopped growing and referred her for an emergency scan but a doctor said it was n't necessary ‘ everything was fine with the pregnancy up until 39 weeks			1
i went for a check up on april 17 and the midwife was concerned my bump had n’t grown			0
‘ i was booked in for an emergency scan but no slots were available until april 20			1
‘ a locum consultant then checked me out on april 20 and he just said i was fully engaged and there was no problem with the growth , so i did n’t have the scan			0
four days after the scan should have taken place , ms @entity8 's @entity22 realised her baby had died			1
@entity25 had to be induced and was delivered using forceps			1
image shows her footprints ‘ the problem was he was looking at notes which said i had been seen just a few days before so he said “ of course the baby has n’t grown ”			2
‘ he said it was unethical the nurse had referred me for a scan because it would have concerned me unnecessarily			2
april 17 , 2012 - @entity76 refers ms @entity8 for an emergency scan because of concerns her baby has not grown			1
april 20 , 2012 - @entity80 consultant accidentally reads notes from april 17 check up and refuses to carry out scan wrongly believing the baby ’s growth to be normal			2
april 24 , 2012 - gp examines ms @entity8 and discovers the baby died in the womb			1
april 26 , 2012 - @entity25 is stillborn			1
‘ that was the friday ( april 20 ) then on the following tuesday ( april 24 ) i felt something was n’t right and i went to the gp			0
that was when he confirmed @entity25 had passed away			2
‘ i was in shock , i had felt her kicking the night before			0
‘ if i had had the scan on april 20 then all this would have been picked up			0
i was then induced to go into labour and sent home			2
‘ i had a 12 hour labour - it was horrible			1
my placenta ruptured and i was in so much pain , i was given every drug and even a spinal during the labour			0
‘ i was then taken into theatre and she was delivered using forceps			2
‘ it was very surreal , @entity25 was so quiet and there no crying			0
i was able to stay with her in the bereavement ward			0
’ shockingly , as she was in the bereavement ward another locum consultant wrongly believed he was in the maternity unit and congratulated ms @entity8 on being a new mum			0
ms @entity8 , who works part - time at @entity113 , said : ‘ another locum consultant , who clearly did n’t know where he was just came blustering into the ward and said “ congratulations ” to me			2
ms @entity8 and mr @entity18 have now had another baby - @entity119 - who was nearly lost like @entity25 as she also stopped growing and became distressed near the end of the pregnancy ‘ i did n’t know what to say but the nurses quickly told him he was in the wrong place and told him to get out			1
it ’s just another example of how badly trained the staff were			0
’ after her ordeal , ms @entity8 became pregnant with daughter @entity119 and at the same stage her midwife became concerned the baby was not growing			1
this time she underwent a scan which revealed her unborn child was in distress and she had an emergency caesarean			0
ms @entity8 , who lives with partner @entity18 , 21 , and six - month - old @entity119 , is now contacting solicitors to take legal action against the @entity3			2
ms @entity8 said : ' i know that @entity25 could have been saved if the problems had been detected earlier , instead i had to go through the worst experience of my life , something which no one should go through			1
' image shows the order of service from her funeral she said : ‘ i was terrified during the whole of the pregnancy with @entity119 because i thought the same thing was going to happen again			0
‘ it did happen again though , the bump had n’t grown enough but it was picked up on and i had a scan			0
the doctors said she needed to be delivered immediately			0
‘ @entity119 was born through a @entity156 six weeks early and she was in the neonatal unit for two weeks but she was absolutely fine - that was what should have happened to @entity25			1
‘ i was treated like royalty during the second pregnancy and i always feel like it was because they knew something wrong had been done before			0
’ in his report to the @entity167 , dr @entity13 , who had been working at the hospital for seven months , said : ‘ i was informed that there were no ( ultrasound ) slots available as the department was too busy			0
‘ i called the patient in to see me in the clinic room			0
i felt after clinical examination findings an ultrasound scan was not warranted			0
i transferred her back to midwife led care			0
’ the @entity167 denies negligence but has apologised for the standard of care ms @entity8 received			1
@entity183 , head of midwifery for @entity185 , said : ‘ we would like to send our sincerest condolences to ms @entity8 and her family at this very sad time			0
‘ we take the safety and care of all of our patients very seriously and have undertaken a detailed investigation into the antenatal care ms @entity8 received			1
‘ i would like to apologise to ms @entity8 and would welcome an opportunity to meet with her to discuss any aspect of her care further			2

@entity8 , 26 , thinks her baby , @entity25 , would have survived if the care she had received at @entity14 had been better
she was referred to a doctor and booked in for an emergency scan when a midwife noticed her baby had stopped growing at 39 weeks of pregnancy
when she saw the doctor , she was told she did n't need a scan
four days later , she saw her gp as she was worried something was wrong
she was told her baby had died and had to be induced - she had to go through a 12 hour labour before @entity25 was delivered using forceps
