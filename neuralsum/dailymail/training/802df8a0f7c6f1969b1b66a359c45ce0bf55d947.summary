during the trial the boy , now 14 , described being starved nearly to death and locked in both a closet and a bathroom for days on end by his father and his father 's girlfriend			1
trial : the boy testified at the child abuse trial of @entity9 , pictured , last month the boy , without shedding a tear or changing his tone of voice , told the court they put him in a closet and secured the door with a bungee cord and a desk			1
he even bravely illustrated with a laser pointer how they wrapped a cord around the knobs of the sliding closet doors to keep him inside			0
when asked if @entity50 and @entity8 would talk to him , he replied : ' not unless they were telling me to be quiet , basically			1
' they gave him diapers so they would n't have to let him out to use the bathroom and he was fed macaroni noodles , ramen noodles and sometimes canned vegetables			2
when he was out of the closet he would take any food he could find and hide it , he said			0
evidence : the court was shown pictures of the closet the boy was locked in , pictured bathroom : he was also locked in this bathroom numerous holidays passed when he was locked away , including @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			1
later , he was locked in a bathroom after his father zip - tied him to the post of a bunk bed for three days and he chewed through the ropes to escape			2

he was then put back inside with a stocking full of coal			0
' i just cried , ' he recounted			0
he noticed himself getting smaller he said , and his clothes getting baggier			0
the court was shown a tiny pair of @entity160 pajamas , boys size 8 , that he was found in and pictures showing a malnourished child with gaunt cheeks and skeletal ribs			1
it was n't until march 2012 that he was rescued from his hell , when a family friend raised the alarm			2
at the time , investigators said another month of the alleged horrific abuse would have killed him			2
thankfully , there were no obvious signs of the trauma he endured when he appeared in court , now a teen , not yet 5 - feet tall			0
he smiled at times and even laughed			0
arrest : the couple were finally arrested in march 2012 when the boy was freed rescued : the boy , with his face obscured , is seen in march 2012 when police rescued him from the home making the case all the more horrific is the fact that teachers at the child 's school first reported his injuries to authorities some 17 months before he was eventually rescued			1
distraught teachers at @entity192 said they repeatedly called the @entity193 to try to get help for the boy , then aged 12			0
the abuse started while he was a pupil at the school			0
the boy moved to @entity200 where he spent just 10 days in class before being withdrawn to be home - schooled			2
@entity8 and @entity50 were angered because he was getting extra food at school , police said			2
about two months after taking him out , they told the district he would attend a private school - essentially stopping the district 's efforts to keep track of him and his education			2
home : distraught teachers at @entity192 said they repeatedly called the @entity214 to try to get help for the boy , then aged 12 , but were ignored ' we tried , and we tried , and we begged , ' said @entity218 , the boy 's teacher at the school he attended for third , fourth and fifth grade			2
' i honestly thought the next call that i got about him was that he would be dead			0

' i called them so many times because of my concerns with the kids , they told me to stop calling , ' he said			0
' if youâ € ™ re told by @entity193 to stop calling , what else can you do ? who else can you call ? ' the last time the department looked into the complaints was 2010 when they decided there was not enough evidence to justify removing the boy from his father			2
' there is a difference between reporting child abuse and reporting concern and being able to remove a child from their home , ' @entity193 spokeswoman @entity247 told @entity255			1
speaking to @entity256 at the time she added : ' you ca n't remove a child on a hunch			2
of all the resources we have , the one tool we do n't have is a crystal ball			0
' begging for help : ' we tried , and we tried , and we begged , ' said @entity218 , the boy 's teacher at the school he attended for third , fourth and fifth grade , of @entity193 action was eventually taken on march 15 when a woman walked into @entity272 told officers her boyfriend had gone to a friend 's home and had seen an emaciated boy locked in the bathroom			1
detectives went to the house and found the boy curled up on the floor			2
police said the boy would be zip - tied to a bed in a standing position and forced to sleep that way			0
to stop him from crying , a dirty sock was duct - taped in his mouth			0
the couple arrived home while police were still at the property and reportedly confessed to caging and punishing the boy , including denying him food , according to local 6 news			0

hospital staff said the condition of the child when he was found resembled images of ' concentration camp survivors			2
' he was severely malnourished and treated for dehydration			0
the boy and two of his siblings have been in @entity193 custody since the ordeal .			0

@entity8 , 44 , took a plea deal in court and told a judge he did it to help his son
@entity8 now faces between 19 and 30 years behind bars , but that 's much less than his girlfriend , @entity9 , who faces life in prison
last month @entity9 , 49 , was found guilty on eight counts of aggravated child abuse
she abused her boyfriend 's son by locking him in a cupboard
the boy , now 14 , who has n't been identified , testified that he was starved
he was rescued two years *ago* weighing just 40 pounds
he did n't shed a tear as he recounted years spent locked up in a closet and a bathroom
