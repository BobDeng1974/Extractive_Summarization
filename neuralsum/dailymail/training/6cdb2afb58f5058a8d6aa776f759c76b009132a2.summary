there are some experiences in life which money simply can not buy			2
as a son of @entity7 growing up a @entity9 supporter , the @entity5 rivalry coursed through @entity11 ’s veins as soon as he was old enough to distinguish blue from green			1
once resident at @entity17 , countless pep - talks and first - hand accounts of playing in the famous fixture were on tap from the former midfielder and club captain			1
@entity11 ( right ) celebrates with his team - mates after @entity22 scored for @entity9 in the @entity5 and yet , reflecting now on his first taste of the game — a goalless draw at the outset of season 1998 - 99 — he believes words alone are inadequate to accurately convey the out - of - body experience that awaits sunday ’s debutants			1
‘ i probably touched the ball five or six times and i was poor , ’ he recalled of the match at the outset of @entity33 ’s era in charge			1
‘ everything flew past me and i learned to play better next time			2
‘ you honestly do n’t know what to expect			0
i played in some games where it just flew past me and then the whistle went			0
@entity11 ( left ) argues with @entity44 's @entity43 as an @entity5 at @entity45 gets heated ‘ i was left there thinking : “ i did n’t even turn up there ” because i had n’t been involved , whereas in other games it was great			1
‘ it ’s a strange game			0
often there ’s no point in shouting at your team - mates as they ca n’t hear you			2
‘ i had a mixture of emotions in the game and the emotion you want is a winning one			0
‘ if you get that , the fans have the bragging rights and that ’s what you want			0
it ’s not just for you and your team - mates , it ’s for however many thousand fans are there supporting you , too			2
‘ you should n’t forget that			0
’ @entity11 ’s career offers him a sharp sense of perspective on the @entity5 ’s true standing in the @entity77 game			1
his first departure from @entity9 saw him land at @entity79 , where jousts with near - neighbours @entity81 were eagerly awaited			1
after battling with @entity82 ( right ) @entity11 takes on another @entity44 player at @entity17 a second spell in @entity85 with @entity86 came with the rarefied atmosphere of the @entity89 clash with @entity90			1
meaty though both games were , @entity11 insists there was simply no comparison with the meeting of @entity44 and @entity9			1
‘ i got told it ( the @entity97 ) was going to be mental and it was just like a normal game , ’ he shrugged			0
‘ after it , away from the ground , there were maybe a few riots but apart from that it was normal			0
‘ you ca n’t hear yourself talk when you ’re in an @entity5			1
do n’t get me wrong , it ’s still passionate down there but this is a different ball game			2
’ an occasion for experience if ever there was one then			0
of @entity44 ’s likely starting side , only @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 have derby memories in their scrap books			1
@entity9 captain @entity11 stands over an injured @entity119 during one of his many derby battles for all their lower league status , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 are well placed to talk the @entity5 novices in the blue corner through an afternoon they are unlikely to forget in a hurry			1
all have a key role to play			2
‘ i ’m sure they will have a massive influence on the dressing room , ’ added @entity11			1
‘ they will let people know what it ’s all about			0
’ they could do a lot worse than listen to @entity11 ’s list of dos and don’ts			1
the scorer of an equalising free - kick in @entity9 ’ 3 - 2 triumph in the 2002 @entity148 final , he also failed to see out the 90 minutes at @entity45 two years previously as @entity150 ’s side ran riot in a 6 - 2 win			1
given the sharply contrasting fortunes both sides of the great divide have experienced in recent years , many standing in the green corner feel a repeat of that latter score - line is not beyond the realms of possibility			2
@entity11 acknowledges that , for @entity9 to prevail on sunday , they will have to hit heights not seen too often of late , while @entity44 ’s levels will have to drop			1
in 2000 , a young @entity11 ( right ) watches as @entity165 ( left ) fights for the ball with @entity167 but , like half of @entity169 , he feels that ’s entirely possible			1
‘ form goes out the window and it does n’t matter what league you are in , ’ he insisted			0
‘ @entity5 games are about who wants it most on the day			1
‘ it does n’t matter if @entity44 are top of the league and playing well while @entity9 are going through a sticky patch			1
‘ there were times going into @entity9 - @entity44 games where we were having a hellish time and we won the game			1
‘ i know a lot of people say it but form and whatever league you ’re in do n’t matter			0
it ’s a whole different ball game			2
‘ the atmosphere surrounding it and the week building up to the game are different			0
a lot of people are thinking it ’s going to be an easy ride for @entity44 but i do n’t think so			1
‘ @entity199 is the result			0
’ @entity11 ( second left ) and @entity200 ( left ) applaud the travelling @entity9 supporters in 2009 @entity11 learned quickly that sufficient random factors are always at play in the fixture to make betting on it a mug ’s game			1
bold predictions of acts of derring - do are ill - advised too			2
pride coming before a fall , and all that			0
@entity212 is perhaps a case in point			0
the @entity215 may indeed have said he hoped to score a hat - trick in the game , as opposed to him predicting it , but it was still dressing - room wall fodder			2
and this , too , from a man who ’s recently looked as much as a goal threat as @entity223			0
‘ you do your talking on the pitch , not off the pitch , ’ @entity11 mused			2
‘ that ’s the way i like it done			0
be respectful and if you ’ve got things you want to do on the pitch , do them			0
‘ do n’t speak out because you can end up with custard pie on your face			0
’ three years in the making , sunday ’s clash will necessitate predictions from everyone from the working man to @entity240			2
for those who have stood tall in the midst of a multi-coloured hurricane , such talk is fraught with danger			0
‘ pundits have their say but i never took that into account because you need to actually be involved to realise what it ’s all about , ’ said the current @entity247 manager			0
man ’s great enemy – time – means on sunday , @entity11 will be as powerless as the rest of us to affect the outcome			1
what he ’d give to sample it one more time , though			0
‘ my head says aye but my legs say differently , ’ he smiled .			0

@entity11 was at @entity9 for two spells and was club captain
he knows the ins and outs of the @entity44 - @entity272 rivalry
@entity11 recalls his @entity5 debut , and how he hardly touched the ball
@entity9 play @entity44 in the @entity277 *semi-final* on sunday
