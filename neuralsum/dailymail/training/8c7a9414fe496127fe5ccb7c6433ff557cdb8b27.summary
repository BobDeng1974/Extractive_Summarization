a glitch on the @entity2 website saw travellers offered return , first class flights from @entity6 to @entity7 for just $ 74 ( £ 49 )			1
the round - trip first class tickets from @entity10 to @entity7 , just outside of @entity11 , were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 @entity14 krone due to an apparent error on the site			1
by registering as a customer in @entity14 , holidaymakers could snap up the deal , which would normally set them back $ 5,618 ( £ 3,690 ) and $ 6,778 ( £ 4,452 )			0
for a brief period of time on february 11 , round - trip , first class fares from @entity6 to @entity7 were available on @entity22 for just £ 49 it is unclear how the deal happened and it appears @entity2 has since made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets			1
one customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to @entity22 and changed her country status to @entity14			2
she then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu , for example march 19 to march 25			0
then , using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee , the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent , although the customer did say she left her country as ' @entity14 ' when filling out her postal address			0
the unbelievable fare totalled 491 @entity14 krone , which comes to £ 49 or approximately us $ 74 despite the low costs , two customers reported ' miscellaneous ' charges when they came to play , adding up to $ 326 ( £ 214 ) to the price of the ticket			1
it is not known what these costs represent , but both customers said they were happy to pay as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket			0
@entity54 attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16:20 gmt , but found that selecting @entity14 from the country drop down menu was no longer an option			0
a second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of @entity63 - around $ 206 or £ 135 the country option was then turned back to @entity65			1
it is as yet unclear how many people snapped up the flights during the time of the glitch and whether the airline will honour the bookings			2
according to a statement provided to @entity2 has temporarily suspended sales from its @entity14 website because a third - party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline ’s properly filed fares			2
' this error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of @entity14 and who were not traveling to or from @entity14 but were attempting to book tickets using @entity2 ’s @entity14 site			0

*earlier* this *afternoon* , @entity22 glitch offered *hugely* *discounted* fares
first - class , round trip flights from @entity6 to @entity7 were just us $ 74
as of 16:00 gmt , the website seems to be once again operating as normal
