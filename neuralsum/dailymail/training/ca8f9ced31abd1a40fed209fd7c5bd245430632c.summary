a secret plot to boot @entity1 out of the @entity2 is being drawn up by senior @entity4 mps			1
they are planning to eject the speaker from his @entity8 constituency at the next general election by fielding a ‘ proper ’ @entity4 candidate against him			1
the move would drive a coach and horses through the convention at @entity15 that sitting @entity16 are never challenged at @entity17 by candidates from the three main political parties			2
but some senior @entity20 are now so angry over mr @entity1 ’s attempt to appoint an ‘ unqualified ’ @entity22 to be the new @entity23 that they are determined to remove him			1
' beyond a joke ' : senior @entity20 have criticised @entity27 's performance after he attempt to recruit the ' unqualified ' @entity28 ( right ) as the £ 200,000 - a - year @entity23 one said privately last night : ‘ putting up a @entity4 candidate against @entity1 at the @entity30 may break with convention but frankly , the speaker ’s performance is beyond a joke			1
‘ this may be the nuclear option but we have to act			0
’ at the last election in 2010 , former @entity4 mp mr @entity1 was famously challenged by @entity39 leader @entity38 in @entity8 , beating him by 14,450 votes			1
but the @entity20 , @entity41 and @entity42 honoured the @entity2 convention that as speakers give up their party political affiliations when they take office , they should not face candidates from the main parties at election time			0
the secret plans emerged as mr @entity1 faces a commons ’ showdown this week over the controversial decision to propose @entity22 parliament official @entity28 to the £ 200,000 - a - year @entity23 and chief executive post			1
in a full - scale commons debate , mps are set to ask how an interview panel led by mr @entity1 chose ms @entity58 to be the @entity2 ’ main constitutional adviser and expert despite claims she had no real experience for that key role			2
mr @entity1 was last week forced to ‘ pause ’ the appointment process in the face of protests from mps who also want to know how ms @entity58 was picked when her department in @entity72 is undergoing two separate investigations – including one into claims that officials used @entity75 to spy on an @entity22 senator ’s office			2
however , there were fears last night that mps were under pressure not to ‘ rake over ’ the details of the panel ’s decision and instead focus on whether the @entity2 ’ clerk role should be split to create a procedural / constitutional adviser post and a separate chief executive to oversee everyday running of @entity2 ’ facilities			0
at the last election in 2010 , former @entity4 mp mr @entity1 was famously challenged by @entity39 leader @entity38 in @entity8 , beating him by 14,450 votes			1
the fears grew amid signs from the speaker ’s office that mr @entity1 intends to chair this week ’s debate , despite private claims from some @entity69 that it would be ‘ completely wrong ’ for him to oversee a debate where his conduct could be a key part of the discussions			1
last night , @entity4 mp @entity102 , one of the speaker ’s fiercest critics over the issue , said colleagues had to be able to demand ‘ full ’ answers over how the nomination had been arrived at			0
he told @entity109 : ‘ the speaker can not be allowed to walk away from what has been a shambolic and woeful selection procedure , which has not only disrupted the @entity113 and its officers but has also hurt the reputation of the candidates for the job			0
’ many mps insist that @entity119 , deputy to outgoing @entity121 sir @entity120 , should have got the job			0
last night , allies of the speaker reacted in fury to the @entity4 plot to unseat him and insisted conservative party chiefs would not sanction any such challenge			0
@entity4 mp @entity128 said : ‘ putting a conservative candidate up against @entity1 would break with a hallowed commons tradition			2
speakers are non-partisan , non-political figures , and although some people may think this is a clever wheeze now , they would come to regret it in the long term			0

move would go against convention that a sitting speaker is *n't* challenged
follows mr @entity1 's attempt to appoint an ' unqualified ' @entity23
one senior @entity4 said his performance has been ' beyond a joke '
in 2010 , mr @entity1 was challenged by @entity38 in his @entity8 seat
