by @entity0 many sleep experts blame using mobiles and tablets into the early hours for a bad night 's sleep , but gadgets may not disrupt sleep at all – so long as you dim the lights and keep it at a safe distance from your face			1
recent research has shown that led screen disrupts sleep because it stops the body producing the hormone melanin , which responds to light and govern whether we feel sleepy or not			1
but the new study has found that simply lowering the brightness of a screen and holding the gadget about 12 inches away from the face can stop the light from interfering with a good night ’s sleep			1
smartphones and other gadgets used before bed can cause restless nights because the light causes melatonin suppression - a chemical which controls the body clock ‘ in the old days , people would go to bed and read a book			2
but much more commonly people go to bed and they have their tablet on which they read a book or they read a newspaper or they 're looking at material			0
' the problem is it 's a lit device , and how problematic is the light source from the mobile device ? ’ co-author dr. @entity41 , a psychiatrist at the @entity42 in @entity43 in @entity44 , told @entity48			0
last month @entity52 academic and sleep expert professor @entity49 called for more research into the effects of artificial light after he published an article in journal nature			0
he said that modern humans are exposed to four times more light than 60 years ago and it was disrupting our sleep patterns			0
he explained that the decline in the number of hours slept per night is affecting public health , including a greater risk of obesity , diabetes , heart disease , depression and stroke in adults and concentration problems in children			0
previous studies found that using a phone late at night prevents production of the sleep hormone melanin			1
now experts say holding the phone close to your face could be the problem the new study investigated how levels of light emitted from mobile devices at different distances from a user 's face compared to the threshold of light that suppresses the secretion of melatonin , 30 lux			0
in a dark room , they used a sensitive light meter to measure the light coming from two @entity101 tablets and a smartphone : an @entity103 1 , an @entity104 3 with retinal display , and an @entity106			1
the emitted light was measured at 0 inches and 14 inches from a user 's face			0
results showed that when the brightness was lowered to the minimal setting , the led lights of all three devices were well below the 30 lux melatonin - suppressing threshold			1
‘ we found that only at the highest setting was the light over a conservative threshold that might affect melatonin levels , ' said dr. @entity41			0
' if it 's at the mid setting or at a low setting it 's bright enough to use			0
’ experts said some gadgets only need the backlight dimmed while other devices such as the @entity104 3 require a two - pronged approach to reduce light levels becoming too high at the lowest brightness setting , held right up against a user 's face , the @entity106 's backlight measured only 2 lux , the @entity104 1 measured 11 lux , and the @entity104 3 measured 2 lux			1
held 14 inches away from a user 's face , all the devices measured between 0 and 3 lux at the lowest brightness setting			2
at the brightest setting measured from the same distance from a user 's face , the @entity106 measured 275 lux , the @entity104 1 measured 124 lux , and the @entity104 3 measured 248 lux — all far above the melatonin - disrupting limit			1
when held 14 inches away at the brightest setting , the @entity106 measured 8 lux and the @entity104 1 measured 21 lux			1
the @entity104 3 , however , measured 32 lux — just above the threshold			2
the results suggest that if you must use your smartphone or tablet before bed , you should either keep the screen brightness at the lowest setting or hold it at least a foot from your face in order to avoid disrupting sleep			0
if you have a mobile device with a particularly strong backlight , like the @entity104 3 , you should do both .			2

previous studies have shown that led lights in phones disturb production of sleep hormone melanin
but by making simple *adjustments* you can still get a good night 's sleep
most phones just need dimming but certain gadgets such as the @entity104 must be held at a distance , say the @entity173 researchers
