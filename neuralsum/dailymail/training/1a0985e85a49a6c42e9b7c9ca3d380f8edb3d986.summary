by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 7 august 2013 these stunning images may look like beautiful , psychedelic prints , but they are in fact photographs of the colourful interiors of meteorites			2
the space rocks are usually known for their dull exterior , but scientist @entity8 has shown the dazzling world beneath the grey surface			1
he has photographed hundreds of 4.5 billion - year - old meteorites by using a standard slr camera and a powerful microscope to zoom in on fragments of the rocks			1
scientist @entity8 has created a set of stunning saturated images that look like stained - glass windows , but are actually photographs of wafer thin slices of meteorites the space rocks are usually known for their dull appearance , but mr @entity8 , who is 66 and from @entity25 , has shown the dazzling world beneath the grey surface			1
the above image shows loose crystal grains in dark matrix from a thin section of @entity32 meteorite			2
the horizontal dimension of this field of view is about 0.085 inches when viewed from a close - up angle , the crystals inside the 0.5 by 0.9 inch slivers appear as a myriad of colours			2
mr @entity8 captures the kaleidescope of patterns by attaching a polarising filter to his camera and affixing this to his microscope			1
he purchases the miniatures pieces of meteorites from collectors , who painstakingly spend hours cutting , grinding , and polishing them until they are thin enough to use			0
mr @entity8 has photographed hundreds of thin fragments of meteorites by using a standard digital slr camera attached to a petrographic microscope			1
two polarising filters are required to create a clear image and enhance the colours from the light shining through the slice from underneath he purchases the miniature pieces of meteorites from collectors , who painstakingly spend hours cutting , grinding , and polishing them until they are thin enough to use at @entity32 in @entity65 , many fragments of meteorites were found , including this thin section of a @entity32 meteorite			1
the left half of the slide , along a diagonal arc from upper left to lower right , is part of a large chondrule that has been melted			0
chondrules are small , rounded particles embedded in most stony meteorites ' i began studying thin sections of rocks and meteorites in 2004 , ' said mr @entity8 , 66 , from @entity25 , @entity81			1
' i taught myself how to identify minerals in thin sections by measuring index of refraction with a microscope			1
' now i use a spectrograph and computer software , and i started taking photographs of the colourful bits in the meteorites			2
' variations in optical glass and in mounting lenses can alter the polarisation of light passing through the lenses			1
' making the photographs takes a matter of seconds to minutes , depending on how thoroughly you want to document the section and what you are trying to learn from it			0
' mr @entity8 used variations in optical glass and in mounting lenses to alter the polarisation of light passing through the microscope creating these dazzling colours most meteorites , such as the one shown , are fragments of asteroids which have fallen from the asteroid belt between @entity113 and @entity114			1
the biggest meteorite that has been found on @entity116 weighs 60 tons and plummeted from space 80,000 years ago ' i taught myself how to identify minerals in thin sections by measuring index of refraction with a microscope , ' said mr @entity8			1
' now i use a spectrograph and computer software , and i started taking photographs of the colourful bits in the meteorites			2
' all the meteorites and thin sections were acquired from other collectors , who spend between two and 20 hours making them , depending on the type of material			1
' the reactions i get are mostly along the lines of " what is that ? " but i quite often get " wow , those are pretty " ' , said mr @entity8			2
most meteorites are fragments of asteroids which have fallen from the asteroid belt between @entity113 and @entity114			0
this volume of space contains more than 1 million objects ranging in size from 1m to 800km			0
the biggest meteorite that has been found on @entity116 weighs 60 tons and plummeted from space 80,000 years ago			0
it landed in the @entity149 of @entity150 in @entity151 and was discovered by the owner of the land in 1920 while he was ploughing			0
a piece of a @entity32 meteorite , which are thought to have cooled by about one - half degree per million years			0
this means they must have been buried deep within a larger piece of rock			0
this would require an object ( like an asteroid ) to be between 400km and 800km in diameter a pair of chondrules from the @entity168 , which fell in 1969 at @entity169 , @entity170			0
chondrules form as molten or partially molten droplets in space before being accreted to their parent asteroids			0
they represent one of the oldest solid materials within our solar system			0

the images were created using a standard slr camera , a microscope , a filter , a spectrograph and *simple* software
@entity25 photographer , @entity8 , taught himself how to identify minerals within the meteorite in thin sections
variations in filter lenses altered the polarisation of light passing through the microscope to create the colours
