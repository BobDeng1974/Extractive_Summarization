by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 22 october 2013 hoax : @entity2 , 36 , was jailed for 12 months after he sparked a bomb scare at his wedding venue rather than tell his fiancée he had failed to finalise their marriage plans at @entity8 , @entity9 a groom who made a hoax call pretending explosives were hidden at his wedding venue just days after the @entity14 bombings has been sentenced to a year in prison			1
@entity2 sparked the bomb scare because he did not want to tell his bride - to - be that he had failed to finalise their wedding plans			1
the 36 - year - old , who has been jailed for 12 months , has been criticised by a judge who told him that his call ' struck terror ' into venue staff , who would have had the explosions in @entity14 at the forefront of their minds			1
panic - stricken @entity2 had telephoned @entity8 in @entity9 and told how explosives had been planted in the building to hide his blunder with the booking because he could not face telling his fiancée			2
bride - to - be @entity33 turned up to the famous @entity35 listed venue wearing her white dress , only to discover the venue for her big day was swarming with police			1
although the couple had pencilled in a date at the iconic building , the embarrassed groom realised he had not filled in the ‘ right to marry ’ forms to legalise the marriage			1
@entity2 , of @entity46 in @entity47 , admitted making a hoax call in a panic , from a phone box near his home			1
he told a receptionist : ' there ’s a bomb in @entity8 and it will go off in 45 minutes			0
' following the call the building was placed on lock down while bomb disposal units and police officers searched the venue from top to bottom			2
however , when the building was re-opened later in the day , the venue confirmed that no booking for the wedding had been made			0
@entity2 had planned to marry miss @entity33 at @entity67 , which is situated within the listed @entity8 , on april 24			2
it is understood @entity2 and miss @entity33 are still together but , six months on from the incident , have still not tied the knot and have no plans to do so			1
threats : @entity2 called the @entity35 - listed @entity8 in @entity9 and told staff that there were explosives hidden inside the famous building plans : @entity2 and his fiancée had pencilled in a date to get married at the hall , but he never filled in the ' right to marry ' forms to legalise the marriage he pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information with intent at an earlier hearing at @entity88			1
sentencing @entity2 today , judge @entity89 said : ' i just do n’t accept that the penny dropped on the night before the wedding			2
' you are an intelligent man with a degree			0
maybe there was an ambivalence in your mind about the wedding and suddenly you got yourself into quite a predicament			0
' it seems that you buried your head in the sand until the day of the wedding			0
' the judge said that the hoax call had been made just days after two explosions went off at the finish line of the @entity108 , leaving three dead , and that the tragedy ' must have been at the very forefront of peoples ’ minds '			1
he added : ' your call to @entity8 must have struck sheer terror in the heart of the person that received the call and fear in the minds of the people who are charged with the responsibility of the safety of people inside the building			0
' you knew that the wedding could n’t take place and you did n’t try to level with your partner			0
' instead , you tried to weasel your way out of the situation			0
' it seems there was a betrayal of trust in your relationship			0
i hope you learn from this experience but you have to understand that bomb hoaxes are extremely serious			0
