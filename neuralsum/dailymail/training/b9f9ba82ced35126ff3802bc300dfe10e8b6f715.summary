by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 chief @entity2 has revealed that the £ 32million deal to sign @entity6 defender @entity5 will signal the end of their summer spending			1
@entity5 ’s arrival has been held up due to issues over third - party ownership but @entity3 hope to conclude protracted negotiations before next weekend ’s @entity14 against @entity15 at @entity16			1
the 23 - year - old @entity17 has already passed a medical and agreed personal terms , and his signing will take the club ’s outlay on new players this summer to a relatively modest £ 50million following the purchase of his former @entity6 teammate @entity24 , @entity15 defender @entity25 and @entity27 goalkeeper @entity26			1
‘ we do n’t plan season by season , we plan in cycles , ’ he said			2
‘ we knew one year ago the positions we wanted to reinforce in the team and we did it			0
‘ we have a new right - back , a new holding midfielder and we will have a new central defender and that ’s it			1
we do n’t need to sign new players for the sake of it			2
‘ we need to sign the players that the team needs because the team has a balance			2
to win you need to keep the balance			0
our squad is very strong and it ’s the second year they play coached by @entity35 so they ’ll do much better			0
’ @entity35 won the title in his first season in @entity72 after spending nearly £ 100m on @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 last summer			2
the focus now will be on which players to offload as @entity3 look to trim their squad and comply with @entity42 ’s punishment			1
they are set to sell either @entity74 or @entity83 to reduce the number of foreigners , while @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 are all expected to go			0
not done yet : @entity35 confirmed that @entity3 's £ 32m move for @entity6 defender @entity5 was not ' 100 per cent ' completed @entity91 seen in @entity3 video on his way : @entity5 has already undergone his medical at @entity3 and toured the club 's facilities city are also prepared to listen to offers for @entity99 who will be pushed further down the pecking order once they have signed @entity5			1
with the @entity103 defender due to start pre-season training on monday following his involvement at the @entity106 , @entity3 want to tie up his transfer as soon as possible			1
their remaining @entity106 contingent – captain @entity110 , @entity73 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 – will report back to @entity114 at the start of the week , although it is still unclear if @entity35 and his squad will be back in @entity72 by then			0
even if @entity3 beat @entity117 in their last group game of the @entity119 in @entity120 today ( sat ) , they face a three - and - a - half - hour wait to see if @entity122 can clinch top spot and a place in monday ’s final by overcoming @entity125 in @entity126			1
the peculiar situation means the players will not know if they are flying to @entity129 or @entity130 until later in the day			0
the @entity131 : @entity132 has become one of @entity135 's first signings after leaving @entity136 city are likely to be regular visitors to the @entity139 in future after launching their new franchise , @entity142			1
@entity132 and @entity143 have already been signed for the club ’s debut season in @entity146 next year , and @entity2 believes that @entity3 ’s involvement was critical in persuading the two men to move to @entity149			1
‘ one of reasons @entity143 and @entity132 decided to come to @entity142 is because they know who manages and who owns the club , ’ he said			0
‘ we have some very bright star players , young players in @entity42 we might ask them to come to @entity142 to play before they play at @entity3			2
there are all sorts of advantages			0
‘ i think this will raise the bar for the whole league			0
i think we will push the bar and others will follow			0

@entity6 defender @entity5 was spotted being shown around the training ground last month and should sign in the near future
