president @entity0 faces rising pressure to intervene in the civil war @entity4 officials say they suspect the deadly agent sarin has already been fired off in small - scale attacks mr @entity0 wary of launching military action based on primary intelligence reports of chemical weapons use @entity0 : investigation into whether @entity11 was using chemical weapons on its own people could take a long time by @entity15 published : 22:18 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 02:39 est , 27 april 2013 president @entity0 warned @entity11 on friday that its use of chemical weapons would be a ' game changer ' for the @entity4 but made clear he was in no rush to intervene in the @entity11 civil war on the basis of evidence he said was still preliminary			1
speaking a day after the disclosure of @entity4 intelligence that @entity11 had likely used chemical weapons against its own people , @entity0 mixed talked tough while calling for patience as he sought to fend off pressure for a swift response against @entity11 president @entity31			1
' horrific as it is when mortars are being fired on civilians and people are being indiscriminately killed , to use potential weapons of mass destruction on civilian populations crosses another line with respect to international norms and international law , ' @entity0 told reporters at the @entity44 as he began talks with @entity47 's @entity46			2
but @entity0 stopped short of declaring that @entity31 had crossed " a red line " and described the @entity4 intelligence evaluations as ' a preliminary assessment			2
' while some more hawkish lawmakers have called for a @entity4 military response and for the arming of @entity64 rebels , several leading congressional voices urged a calmer approach after secretary of state @entity67 briefed them			0
' this is not @entity69 , ' said @entity70 , the senior @entity71 in the @entity72 , referring to the relative ease with which a @entity75 bombing campaign helped overthrow @entity76 in 2011			0
' the @entity11 have anti-aircraft capability that makes going in there much more challenging			0
' president @entity0 : ' to use potential weapons of mass destruction of civilian populations crosses another line ' @entity4 officials said on thursday the intelligence community believes with varying degrees of confidence that @entity31 's forces used the nerve agent sarin on a small scale against rebel fighters			1
@entity0 had warned earlier that deployment of chemical weapons by the @entity11 government would trigger unspecified consequences , widely interpreted to include possible @entity4 military action			1
aides have insisted that the @entity98 president will need all the facts before he deciding on action , making clear it is mindful of the lessons of the start of the @entity105 war more than a decade ago			0
then , the @entity107 administration of president @entity108 used inaccurate intelligence to justify the invasion of @entity105 in pursuit of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons that turned out not to exist			2
@entity4 officials said the evaluation that @entity11 probably used chemical weapons was based in part on ' physiological ' samples but have refused to say exactly where they came from or who supplied the material			1
warning : @entity122 images follow @entity11 weaponry : the @entity44 says it does n't have ' airtight ' proof that the @entity11 government used chemical weapons against its own people battle wounds : a wounded @entity11 man holding his injured son after an air raid in the northwestern of @entity11			1
the @entity44 has said the @entity11 government has twice used chemical weapons symptoms : pictures have suggested @entity11 may have used chemical weapons @entity138 usage ? a woman foams at the mouth while lying on a stretcher at a hospital in @entity11			2
it is not known if the symptoms resembled those triggered by a chemical weapons attack were @entity138 's used ? animal carcasses lie on the ground , killed by what residents said was a chemical weapon attack in the northern city of @entity153			2
the @entity154 says it will investigate the claims @entity44 spokesman @entity156 said the evidence so far of @entity11 chemical weapons use was not an " airtight case " and declined to set a deadline for corroborating reports			1
@entity0 and his aides also appeared intent on deflecting pressure for swift action by stressing the need for a comprehensive @entity154 investigation on the ground in @entity11 - something @entity31 has blocked from going forward			1
the @entity4 has resisted being dragged militarily into @entity11 's conflict and is providing only non-lethal aid to rebels trying to overthrow @entity31			2
@entity172 is worried that weapons supplied to the rebels could end up in the hands of @entity176 - linked fighters			0
but acknowledgment of the @entity4 intelligence assessment appeared to move the @entity4 closer - at least rhetorically - to some sort of action in @entity11 , military or otherwise			1
@entity156 said @entity0 would consider a range of options including , but not exclusive to , military force , should it be determined that @entity11 has used chemical weapons			1
' often the discussion , when people mention all options are on the table , everyone just talks about military force , " he said			0
" it 's important to remember that there are options available to a commander in chief in a situation like this that include but are not exclusive to that option			0
' protestors : demonstrators chant slogans and wave @entity11 opposition flags as a boy shouts into a loud hailer during a protest against @entity11 president @entity31 afer friday prayers evidence : the @entity4 believes with varying degrees of confidence that @entity11 's regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale			1
president @entity0 says he needs ' credible and corroborated ' facts before acting some @entity4 experts warn that @entity0 risks further emboldening @entity31 if he acts too slowly or not all , but the @entity44 must also keep in mind polls showing most @entity4 , weary of wars in @entity105 and @entity216 , are against new military entanglements			1
as a result , @entity0 is unlikely to turn to military options quickly or without allies joining him			0
those options vary from limited one - off missile strikes , perhaps one of the least complicated scenarios , to more bold operations like carving out no - fly , " safe zones			0
" one grim scenario envisions sending tens of thousands of @entity4 forces to help secure the chemical weapons			2
current and former @entity4 officials see little chance of achieving success through the two main diplomatic options : persuading @entity234 to increase pressure on @entity11 at the @entity236 , or pressuring @entity31 to negotiate his own departure			1
' there is no evidence of any interest on the part of @entity31 , who seems to think @entity242 and @entity243 and @entity234 can pull his chestnuts out of the fire , ' said @entity246 , who was a top @entity247 official working on @entity11 until september			0
destroyed lives : the number of @entity11 who have fled their conflict - ravaged homeland has surpassed 1.4 million , the @entity154 refugee agency said , warning that it was no longer able to meet their medical needs the @entity0 administration 's sudden disclosure of its chemical weapons findings came just two days after it played down an @entity260 assessment that there had been repeated use of chemical weapons in @entity11			1
@entity264 and @entity265 have also concluded that evidence suggests chemical arms have been used			0
it is unclear why the @entity0 administration changed its mind so quickly this week			0
weapons inspectors will determine whether banned chemical agents were used in the two - year - old conflict only if they are able to access sites and take soil , blood , urine or tissue samples and examine them in certified laboratories , according to the @entity281 , which works with the @entity154 on inspections			0
assertions of chemical weapon use in @entity11 by @entity288 and @entity260 officials citing photos , sporadic shelling and traces of toxins do not meet the standard of proof needed for a @entity154 team of experts waiting to gather their own field evidence , the organization said .			0
