a theme park has banned adults unaccompanied by children from entry over fears that they could be paedophiles			1
the bizarre rule at @entity7 , in @entity8 , came to light after a bird enthusiast was forbidden from watching a falconry display at the centre on his own			1
@entity14 , 54 , had visited with his three grandchildren just days earlier and wanted to return for another look at the birds of prey area - but was turned away			1
the centre has appeared to contradict itself in justifying the rule - first claiming it has been in place for seven years - before then blaming it on last year 's visit from jailed paedophile @entity24 - the former mayor of @entity25			1
turned away : father - of - three @entity14 , 54 , was banned from entering @entity7 on his own father - of - three mr @entity14 was turned away at the theme park 's gate on thursday with staff telling him they did not admit single men and women on child protection grounds			1
when he complained , bosses at the tourist attraction near @entity25 , @entity8 , defended the bizarre rule and insisted it is ' in line with other parks ' - before sanding him away			1
the married father - of - three said : ' i almost feel discriminated against			2
i could understand it if it was for the attractions that young children only enjoy , but the falconry is of interest to all			0
' i was frankly amazed			0
i was told the rule applies to single men , and women , for the protection of children			2
bizarre rule : the park 's chief has justified the move saying ' there is a lot in the headlines about paedophiles and things that are going on with children ' ' i could n't see anything about the rule on the brochure which i picked up at another attraction			1
' we have taken one of our grandchildren there before , and i saw that the falconry was there and thought it would be interesting to go back and see the displays			2
' they are advertising adult memberships as gifts so i ca n't understand it			0
' the park 's managing director , @entity80 , has claimed the centre was ' forced to implement stringent child protection policies ' because of ' the society in which we live in '			1
he then alluded to the case of @entity24 , the former mayor of @entity25 who visited the theme park before being jailed for child pornography offences last month			1
speaking to the @entity89 , he said : ' if you can not trust civic authority figures then , simply , who can you trust ? the park 's managing director alluded to the case of @entity24 , former mayor of @entity25 , who visited the park before he was jailed for child pornography offences attraction : @entity14 was hoping to see a falconry display at the leisure centre in @entity8 ' mr @entity24 had visited @entity7 to undertake a civic duty and his sinister secrets were only recently exposed and he was jailed for his crimes			1
' the reason appears to contradict the theme park 's earlier claim that the rule had existed for seven years			2
mr @entity80 added : ' we would rather be over zealous when unaccompanied adults visit us armed with cameras than put children at any potential risk			2
' the award - winning @entity7 is a family - orientated leisure attraction which includes zip lines , a play barn , crazy golf and animal enclosures , as well as an owl zone and a falconry centre			1
award - winning : @entity7 is a family - orientated leisure attraction which includes zip lines , a play barn , crazy golf and animal enclosures , as well as an owl zone and a falconry centre mr @entity14 from @entity128 , near @entity129 , @entity8 , had attended the park with his family , and returned on thursday only intending to watch another falconry display			1
but he was banned from entering by staff who claimed their rule was clearly explained on the website			0
the bird enthusiast had visited the centre just days earlier with his grandchildren ( file picture ) the ' prices ' section online states : ' we are sorry but we are unable to let single men or women without children into the park			1
' if you are here to meet someone let one of our reception staff know and they will happily do a tannoy announcement asking them to come and meet you			0
' @entity80 earlier commented : ' there is a lot in the headlines about paedophiles and things that are going on with children			2
' we have done our research and in line with all other parks we do n't let single men or women in			0
' we make it quite clear that if people want to go to the falconry they have to get a prior appointment , and we would take them down to the falconry centre			0
' it is in the leaflet			0
i think if i did a survey of 100 of our customers they would agree that we are doing the right thing			0
' a new statement on the leisure centre 's website reads : ' our members fully support our decisions and we have received nothing but praise for our policy including positive feedback from a @entity185 , who commended us for our child protection principals			1
' within seven years we have only had one complaint about this policy from the gentlemen last week			0
' at the time of setting the policy the other parks within the area had a similar stance to us			0
i have spoken to two or three similar client based parks this morning and they still have the same policy as we do			0
i 'm not going to name names as it 's unprofessional of me to do so			0
' in light of this coverage we will look at what other parks are doing with their admissions policy , speak to our customers and review			0
' a spokesman for @entity210 said : ' it sounds as if @entity7 needs to publicise this particular rule a bit more prominently			2
