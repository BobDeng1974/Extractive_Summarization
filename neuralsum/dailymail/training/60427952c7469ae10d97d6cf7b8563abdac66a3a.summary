@entity20 poses next to the @entity2 trophy cabinet from which 60 trophies were stolen on december 6 @entity2 's factory in @entity13 was smashed by a silver 4x4 - about 20 trophies were found in a lake detective constable @entity26 said : ' we estimate about 20 trophies have been recovered , but we are liaising with @entity2 to establish the exact number , as some of the trophies are damaged			1
' @entity2 team principal @entity31 said the manner in which some trophies were found showed the disregard the criminals had for the objects stolen			1
' it 's good news that some of our trophies have been found and thanks to the police for all their help so far , ' he said on the @entity2 website			1
' the fact that some of the trophies were discarded in a lake and damaged shows how senseless this crime was			2
' while the trophies mean an enormous amount to the team , their intrinsic value is low â€“ and the extent of the damage that was caused to the factory by the offenders during the break - in was significant			2
' hopefully we can get the trophies back to our factory where they belong and get replicas made of those that we ca n't			0
thanks to everyone involved for their help so far			0
' the damage to the factory after the building was ram - raided was clear from the outside after the robbery , @entity31 warned fans of the @entity74 team which won the @entity3 constructors ' championship and drivers ' championship from 2010 - 2013 would be victims too with access to the site likely to be limited in the future			2
' the break - in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time , ' @entity31 said			0
' the offenders took items that not only did not belong to them , but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated , hard - working individuals			0
' beyond the aggressive nature of this break - in , we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies			0
the value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one			0
team principal @entity31 said the ' break - in caused significant damage ' and said it could affect fans ' but their intrinsic value is low ; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and , in addition to that , many of the trophies on display were replicas			0
' the actions of these men mean it 's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future , which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our @entity3 car			1
' anyone with information is asked to contact mr @entity26 at @entity14 on 101 , or @entity130 anonymously on 0800 555 111 .			0
