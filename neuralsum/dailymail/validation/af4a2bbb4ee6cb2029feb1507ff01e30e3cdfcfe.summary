the @entity0 are planning a ‘ kill @entity2 ’ campaign in the @entity4 constituency where @entity5 is standing for @entity6 after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses @entity9 @entity8 is planning a ‘ kill @entity2 ’ campaign in the @entity4 constituency where @entity5 is standing for @entity6 after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses			1
mr @entity5 declared yesterday that it would be ‘ curtains ’ for him if he fails to win the @entity2 target seat of @entity15			1
he conceded it would be impossible for him to continue to dictate @entity2 policy without a seat in the @entity20			0
@entity2 is aiming to win around half a dozen seats , but mr @entity5 appears to face a tougher fight than @entity23 , the @entity9 defector who won a big majority when he stood for @entity2 in a by - election			2
polls suggest he is in a three - way battle with @entity28 and the @entity0			0
the @entity9 hold the seat , while @entity28 previously held it with slightly different borders			0
conservative strategists believe mr @entity5 has made a significant blunder by tying his fortunes in @entity15 to his future as party leader			1
‘ this is a great opportunity , ’ said one			2
‘ we can now make this a decapitation campaign			0
if voters who have previously backed other parties want to stop @entity2 , they can vote for us and cut the head off the snake			0
’ the strategist said that if mr @entity5 stood down after losing the seat , mr @entity23 was likely to take over and ‘ that would be the end of @entity2 ’			1
other candidates to succeed the @entity2 leader include communities spokesman @entity2 and former journalist @entity50 , both @entity51			0
mr @entity5 appears at odds over several areas of policy with key members of his team , mr @entity23 , who has expressed concern about the ‘ ugly nativism ’ of some @entity2 supporters and spoken in favour of immigration			1
the @entity63 mp is also seen as lacking in the broad popular appeal of mr @entity5 by @entity9 campaign chiefs			1
a @entity67 poll commissioned by a @entity2 donor in @entity15 found mr @entity5 to be ahead , but one previous survey had him neck and neck with the @entity9 and another put the @entity9 ahead			1
in an extract from a new book by the @entity2 leader , @entity75 , serialised in the @entity76 , mr @entity5 made clear he would quit as party leader if he fails to become an mp			2
‘ it is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a @entity81 seat , ’ he wrote			2
‘ what credibility would @entity2 have in the @entity83 if others had to enunciate party policy in parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest ? ‘ was i supposed to brief @entity2 policy from the @entity90 ? no – if i fail to win @entity15 , it is curtains for me			1
i will have to step down			0
’ yesterday @entity2 won a boost when broadcasting regulator @entity94 awarded it a second party election broadcast on commercial tv and radio on the basis that it is now a ‘ major party ’			2
@entity101 's strategists hope that defeating mr @entity5 would ' cut the head off the snake ' of @entity2 the bodys guaranteed @entity2 a minimum of two broadcasts in @entity107 and @entity108 on @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , alongside the conservatives , @entity28 and @entity113			0
but it said the @entity115 had not demonstrated sufficient electoral support to justify a similar elevation in status			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ this confirms that @entity2 is now a major party in @entity122 politics			1
voters should now know that despite what all the other parties are going to tell them , the truth is self - evident : if you believe in @entity122 , and want to vote @entity2 , you ’ll get a @entity2 mp			0

@entity5 declared that it would be ‘ curtains ’ for him if loses in @entity15
