by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 12:15 est , 13 january 2014 baby wipes make some children come out in painful , red rashes , new research suggests			1
a chemical preservative called methylisothiazolinone ( @entity9 ) in the wipes causes an allergic reaction in some children , researchers found			1
the chemical has been blamed for a massive rise in dangerous allergic reactions caused by a huge range of beauty products			1
until now , no cases of allergic reactions to wet wipes had been reported in the @entity21 , but the study authors think this could be due to the reactions being misdiagnosed as other conditions , such as eczema			1
baby wipes cause some children to come out in severe , itchy , red rashes , new research suggests ‘ i think it may be more common than people realise , ’ dr @entity30 , an associate professor of dermatology and paediatrics at the @entity33 , told @entity34			1
scientists at the school of medicine studied six children with severe rashes			0
the first child was a girl who had a rash on her face and her buttocks			0
the eight - year - old had already been treated with antibiotics and steroids but after each treatment , the rash reappeared			0
the scientists suspected that she might be suffering from an allergic reaction so asked her mother what she used to clean her			2
the girl ’s mother explained that she used wet wipes to clean her daughter ’s mouth and buttocks			2
dr @entity60 had recently read a report about a @entity63 man who was allergic to the @entity9 in baby wipes			1
she tested the child for an allergy and the results were positive			0
a chemical preservative called methylisothiazolinone in the wipes causes an allergic reaction in some children unsurprisingly , when the girl ’s mother then stopped using baby wipes , her rashes disappeared			1
during the following two years , five more children were brought to the medical centre with similar rashes			0
in each case , the rash disappeared as soon as the children were no longer cleaned with baby wipes			1
despite the discovery , dr @entity60 does not believe parents should stop using baby wipes			1
she told @entity34 : ‘ they ’re so convenient			0
i have three kids , so i know how hard it is to do the changes , especially when you ’re travelling			2
‘ but maybe when you ’re at home , it would be better to use a gentle cleanser and water			2
that way you minimise exposure			0
’ dr @entity99 , from the @entity100 , says the number of children suffering from these reactions is increasing			2
researchers say parents should try to avoid using baby wipes except when they are travelling			1
they say it is better to use a paper towel with water at home she believes this could be because the amount of @entity9 in baby wipes has been increased			1
as a result , she also suggests parents avoid using them except when they are travelling			2
she says that at home it is better to use wet paper towels			1
baby wipes are not the only product to contain @entity9			1
cosmetic giant @entity123 says it is so concerned , it is taking the chemical out of its best - selling @entity126 sun cream and other products			0
@entity128 is doing the same and big brands such as @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 are under pressure to take action as doctors say adverse reactions to the chemical have reached ‘ epidemic proportions ’			0
skin experts say manufacturers should urgently remove the chemical from products that are left on the skin			0
it can cause rashes , lumps , blisters , itchy eyes and facial swelling			0
in one case , a woman ’s head and face swelled up so much that doctors feared she would have trouble breathing without urgent treatment			0
in another , a @entity160 holidaymaker ’s skin became so inflamed that she spent two days in a @entity163 hospital and needed steroids and antihistamines to calm the allergic reaction			0
@entity9 is a preservative designed to extend shelf life , and has no useful properties for users of the products			1
experts say the scale of the allergic reactions to the chemical , which has been used increasingly since 2005 , is alarming			1
dermatologists expect an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product of one or two per cent , but clinics say the rate for @entity9 has been more than 10 per cent			2
leading dermatologist dr @entity181 , from @entity182 in @entity183 , said : ‘ the frequency of reactions to @entity9 is unprecedented in my experience			2
' we ’ve never seen anything quite like it			0
contact allergy to this permitted preservative is now of epidemic proportions			0
immediate action needs to be taken by industry			0

@entity196 ( @entity9 ) , a preservative , can cause allergic reactions
researchers suggest parents only use baby wipes when they are travelling
they say that at home it is safer to use paper towels with water
@entity9 has been blamed for a massive rise in dangerous allergic reactions caused by a huge range of beauty products
