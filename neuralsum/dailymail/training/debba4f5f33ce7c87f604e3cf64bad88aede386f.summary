it 's a gripe often levelled at @entity2 's frosty talent show judges : why do n't you get up and do this yourselves ? a beauty contest judge in @entity6 did just that - and duly out - danced her own contestants to win the £ 3,000 top prize			1
@entity9 made headlines when she triumphed at the @entity12 contest , whose entrants have showcased traditional @entity15 music and dancing for more than 20 years			1
but when the contest took place at a packed sports hall in the capital @entity37 , she jumped over the judges ' table to join in , according to a report by the @entity41			0
there were boos when her performances was given a standing ovation by fellow judge and music promoter @entity46 , 46 , dubbed the contest 's equivalent of @entity50			2
according to the report , he told the crowd : ' i do n't know about you , but i thought she was amazing			0
as far as i 'm concerned , she beat the rest hands down , and she definitely deserves the prize			0
' but his decision was instantly challenged by the third jury member , @entity59			0
criticism : the 19 - year - old ( right ) said she did n't think the other dancers in the show were ' up to much ' fame : the dancer ( left ) has thousands of fans on @entity67			1
right , fellow judge @entity46 , 46 , was a fan bemused : the show provided a spectacle for the audience in the @entity6 capital @entity37 he said that his favourite was one of the original candidates named @entity74 , 17 , and suggested that he would rather give it to her			0
the two judges argued until @entity59 turned and walked out of the contest as the 5,000 - strong audience shouted and catcalled - and the entrants watched in amusement			2
according to the report , @entity9 later posted on her @entity67 page : ' i am sorry that i caused a bit of a mess , it was n't planned			1
' i was n't even an official candidate , but when i saw everybody dancing and i did n't think they looked up to much , i could n't contain myself and wanted to rush out and take part in the thrill of the contest			1
' i never thought i 'd end up winning , and i can promise everybody that nothing was arranged			0
' @entity9 , who adorned her ornate yellow and black outfit with a white miss @entity12 sash , was awarded 4,000 euros ( £ 3,200 ) and a one - week holiday in @entity101			1
she wrote : ' i never thought i 'd end up winning , and i can promise everybody that nothing was arranged ' tv talent show : @entity9 , pictured with her fellow judge @entity46 , decided to abandon the judges ' table			2

@entity9 , 19 , was invited to be judge at miss @entity12 contest
but she ended up taking part - and was duly awarded the *highest* honour
' i could n't contain myself and wanted to rush out and take part ' , she said
