@entity0 sent scouts to watch @entity3 attacking midfielder @entity2 at @entity4 this weekend			1
the 23 - year - old , who has been in fine form in the @entity7 , is in high demand , with @entity0 the latest in a string of @entity11 clubs to show an interest			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 have all considered bids for the 23 - year - old @entity3 who has a release clause reputedly set at Â£ 14.5million			1
@entity19 tells you everything you need to know about the @entity4 forward			0
@entity2 celebrates scoring a late winner for his @entity4 side against @entity24 @entity2 scored the winning goal for @entity26 in just his second international game against @entity28 last year a skillful dribbler - in the past two seasons only @entity30 and @entity31 have embarked on more succesful dribbles in @entity34 's top leagues - and with all the tricks and flicks you might expect from a @entity3 international forward , @entity35 is an attacking midfielder with an eye for goal			1
he is not an out and out goalscorer , as his record of 6 goals in 25 @entity7 games this season shows , but @entity35 is a capable finisher when the chance arises			0
last season 's tally of 16 goals for @entity4 earned him his first @entity26 call - up early this term , and he announced himself in the international stage with a stunning 25 yard strike into the top corner to earn the selecao a win against @entity28 in just his second game			1
the @entity3 's shot from 25 yards flew into the top corner to earn him a first international goal the @entity3 shows off his excellent first touch as he keeps the ball away from two @entity69 defenders however , it is not for his goalscoring exploits that @entity72 will want the 23 - year - old , but his playmaking			1
@entity2 loves to pick a pass , sliding through balls into the strikers from his position in behind , and has racked up 18 league assists since the start of last season			2
to put that number in context , that 's as many as @entity0 's entire midfield against @entity88 - @entity87 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 - have managed in the @entity11 over the past two seasons			0
the @entity3 is usually deployed behind the central striker , but can operate out wide on the left , where his pace and quick feet allow him to beat a man before picking out team - mates			2
with @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 in his position , @entity35 has done well to earn a @entity26 call - up the playmaker holds off a tackle as he embarks on one of his trademark runs in a recent game as well as running past defenders with the ball he has a knack for making attacking runs from deep without it , posing a threat in behind whether coming from central areas on the wing			2
and , when stationed wide on the left , @entity35 has the ability to cut inside and unleash a strike at goal with his favoured right foot , or trouble the full back down the outside with his trickery , causing defenders plenty of problems			0
it remains to be seen if he is quick enough to be a dynamic no 10 in the @entity11 , but the performances in @entity130 have earned praise from the likes of @entity134 sporting director @entity133			0
@entity35 's dribbling , goals and assists have made him one of the hottest properties in the @entity7 ' @entity35 is a great player , ' said @entity133 this week , although he ruled out the player moving to @entity134			0
but the player , his agent , and @entity4 have all admitted he could well leave this season , alerting @entity11 clubs to the possibility of nabbing a star who is undoubtedly one of the @entity7 's hottest prospects .			0

@entity2 has been at @entity4 for four years
this season the 23 - year - old won his first @entity26 caps
quick feet , an eye for goal and plenty of assists have caught the eye
@entity35 is only behind @entity30 and @entity31 in most dribbles
