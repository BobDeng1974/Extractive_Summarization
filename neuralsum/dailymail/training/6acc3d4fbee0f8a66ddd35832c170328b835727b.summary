by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 16:30 est , 10 july 2012 @entity2 's half - brother is making his film debut in a documentary where he talks about his non-existent relationship with his relative who is the most powerful man in the world			1
@entity8 , 30 , lives in @entity9 , @entity10 and first came into the public eye in 2008 when his half - brother was a rising presidential candidate			1
at the time , he was living in a hut in the slum neighborhood of @entity15 , which prompted many critics to deride @entity2 for not providing financial support			2
in a clip released to @entity35 , mr @entity24 asked whether he felt dejected that @entity2 has never offered to help @entity8 , but he simply brushed such claims aside			2
' i think he has a family of his own , he 's supposed to help his family , ' @entity8 responded			0
the journalist did n't let go , saying that they are blood relatives which should entitle him to be considered a part of @entity2 's family , but @entity8 still did n't take the bait			2
familial similarities : though they had different mothers , there are a number of physical similarities between @entity2 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) searching for answers : in 2008 , @entity8 was interviewed about his relationship - or lack thereof - with his half - brother @entity2 and he is seen here reading the then - senator 's book about his @entity10 roots ' @entity59 , i 'm part of his family , but i 'm over-age so i can help myself			1
' he ’s got other issues to deal with			0
he ’s taking care of the world , so he ’s taking care of me			0
' @entity8 says that when he was five or six years old , he met @entity2 briefly			1
' i was just surprised - he is some half white guy , ' @entity8 said in a clip from the documentary			1
@entity2 was born in @entity67 by his mother @entity68 , who was white with various @entity70 ancestry			2
the two men share the common bond of their father , @entity73 , but even that was not very strong because of their age gap			0
@entity2 is 50 - years - old while @entity8 is only 30 - years - old , and @entity76 died in a car accident just six months after @entity8 was born			1
family tree : old family photos show a young @entity2 ( second from left in the back ) among some of his @entity10 relatives back to his roots : while he was a senator from @entity84 in 2006 , @entity2 visited @entity9 , @entity10 the president reportedly has seven half - siblings on his father 's side - including @entity8 , though the paternity of two of his reported half - brothers , named @entity91 and @entity92 , is questioned			1
while president @entity2 has n't spoken for years about his trip to @entity10 as a child , he did write about it in his book @entity93			2
thinking back : @entity8 said that he was about five or six years old when he met @entity2 , remembering that he was ' surprised ' because his half - brother was ' some half white guy ' in the book , he wrote that meeting @entity8 was a ' painful affair ' that was ' hastily arranged ' with the help of @entity2 's half - sister @entity101			1
towards the end of the book which describes a young @entity2 's trip to @entity10 to connect with his extended family , he tells the story about how he and @entity101 drove to the school where @entity8 was at school and had his teacher pull him aside during recess			2
' he was a handsome , roundheaded boy with a wary gaze , ' he wrote			0
' the boy shook our hands bravely but kept glancing back at games he 'd just left			0
i realized then that we 'd made a mistake			0
' i took comfort in the fact that perhaps one day , when he was older , @entity8 , too , might want to know who his father had been , and who his brothers and sisters were , and that if he ever came to me i would be there for him , to tell him the story i knew			0
' in a 2008 interview while then - senator @entity8 was rising through the @entity128 presidential primaries , @entity8 said that he ended up taking @entity2 's prescient advice without knowing it			1
' i think i wanted to learn about my father the same way he did , ' @entity8 told a @entity134 reporter about his decision to read his half - brother 's book			1
happy : though an initial report said that @entity8 was living on less than $ 1 per day , he has since rebuked those statements and said that though he lives in a slum , he is happy and has had a good life different lives : there is a 20 - year age difference between @entity8 and @entity2 , as well as a vast distance between their homes as @entity2 has moved between @entity67 , the @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 while @entity8 lives in @entity10 ' he came here searching for his roots , and i was also trying to find my roots			2
' in the documentary interview , @entity8 said that he remembers little about his father except the stories that his mother told him			0
' he was really educated , ' @entity8 said of his deceased father			0
' my mom was disappointed in me because i actually did n't finish my schooling			0
i really did let her down , i let my father down because he was an intellectual guy			0
' that said , @entity8 did write a book , entitled @entity164 , which was published in 2010			0
while many conservatives - including the interviewer - were likely hoping for a more controversial and damning take on his half - brother , @entity8 seems to be one of the least problematic members of the wide - ranging @entity8 family			1
by comparison , mr @entity8 's ' lost ' half - uncle @entity173 was arrested for driving under the influence which was coupled with an outstanding deportation warrant			1

@entity8 , 30 , spoke about his distant relationship with his half - brother @entity2
says he was surprised when he was a child and met @entity2 , remembering him as ' some half - white guy '
