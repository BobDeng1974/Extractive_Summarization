by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:27 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 16:04 est , 7 january 2014 a federal court ruled monday that @entity5 's ban on private gun ownership , one of the nation 's toughest , violates the @entity1 @entity10 's guarantee of individuals ' rights to bear arms			1
the decision was the fourth major court ruling in recent years to go against the @entity16 , in a trend that has @entity19 supporters trouncing gun - control advocates even in the face of widely publicized school massacres and other public shootings			2
the city ' has not demonstrated that allowing gun sales and transfers within city limits creates such genuine and serious risks to public safety that flatly prohibiting them is justified , ' read the 35 - page decision of judge @entity32 in the @entity33 for the @entity34			1
president @entity35 named @entity32 to the federal bench in 2010			2
the judge put a hold on his own decision so the city can appeal to a higher court			0
he also said that a less restrictive law might pass judicial muster			0
scenes from a future @entity5 ? the federal court ruling means individual @entity46 could soon be allowed to purchase and keep handguns for their own protection not happy : @entity5 mayor @entity49 wants to see his city 's crime rate to continue its downward slide , and does n't believe an armed citizenry will help self - protection : gun - rights crusaders say @entity1 , especially those living in urban areas , should be allowed to arm themselves and learn how to use guns in self - defense @entity5 's gun ban , intended to improve public safety , included a zoning ordinance that prohibited licensed gun dealers , banned individuals from selling guns , and barred @entity46 from giving firearms to family members			1
data published in december show , @entity5 's murder rate is at a 35 - year low			0
but despite the tough restrictions , said @entity74 , a spokesman for @entity5 ’s law department , ' every year @entity5 police recover more illegal guns than officers in any city in the country			2
' @entity74 attributed that statistic to ' lax federal laws ' and ' lax laws in @entity83 and surrounding states related to straw purchasing and the transfer of guns			0
' but ' certain fundamental rights are protected by the @entity10 [ and ] put outside government ’s reach , ' wrote judge @entity32 , ' including the right to keep and bear arms for self - defense under the @entity19			1
' while that constitutional right has its limits – felons and the mentally ill ca n't buy guns , for instance – @entity32 insisted that ' @entity5 ’s ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms , and at the same time the evidence does not support that the complete ban sufficiently furthers the purposes that the ordinance tries to serve			1
' @entity110 : @entity111 sued the @entity112 after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his home for protection , and the @entity118 ruled in his favor -- setting the stage for the ' @entity122 ' ruling that forces state and local governments to observe the @entity19 not likely to become legal : if @entity5 is forced to allow gun sales within its borders , it will likely limit them to handguns and exclude so - called ' assault rifles ' like this @entity131 @entity133 lobbyist @entity132 told the @entity134 that the court decision ' shows how out of step and outrageous @entity5 ’s ordinances really are			1
' city with the big recoil : guns like this @entity142 .40 - caliber semiautomatic pistol could go on sale in @entity5 if the city loses what it a near - certain appeal second amendment foundation vice president @entity147 told @entity148 that ' once again it has taken a federal court ruling to convince city government that @entity5 is not a city - state in the middle of the @entity1 , but part of a nation that is bound by the @entity10 and must honor all of its provisions , including the right to keep and bear arms			1
. ' @entity160 's statement had the ring of a victory lap : it was his organization that pushed the landmark @entity118 case that determined states , not just the federal government , must observe citizens ' @entity19 rights			2
that case , @entity169 , was decided in 2010			0
it ' paved the way ' for monday 's ruling , @entity147 said			0
the @entity133 has complained that the city of @entity5 has ignored that ruling from the high court for more than three years			0
' @entity5 's continued refusal to follow the @entity1 @entity118 's clear directive in its landmark ruling ... is unacceptable , @entity179 , executive director of the @entity133 's @entity180 , said in a statement			0
' the @entity133 will continue to challenge the city until it fully respects the right of its law - abiding residents to keep and bear arms			1

@entity16 has defied 2010 @entity118 ruling that forced state and local governments to observe @entity19 ' right to bear arms '
new ruling says @entity5 ca n't issue a blanket ban on all gun sales that would be legal in other cities
existing law bans licensed dealers from setting up shop , and forbids citizens from giving guns to family members
city government *worries* about public safety while the gun lobby hopes to arm more law - abiding @entity46 – and see fewer violent crime victims
