by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 30 july 2013 her body is so perfectly preserved that it is hard to believe this girl died more than 500 years ago			2
but what is even more remarkable is that scientists today have been able to learn the secrets of her death – by analysing her hair			0
the 13 - year - old @entity13 girl was heavily dosed with alcohol and coca leaves , which form the basis of cocaine , before being left to die of exposure high in the @entity19 as a sacrifice			1
she was well fed and chosen for her beauty and possibly nobility axial radiograph of the interior of the mouth , showing the coca ( green ) held between the teeth			2
@entity34 and alcohol were substances that induced altered states interpreted as sacred and which could suggest to victims and those associated with them the proximity of the divine beings 3d visualisations of the @entity45 's cranium ( yellow ) , teeth ( orange ) , tongue ( red ) and the coca ( green )			2
the @entity45 had pieces of coca leaves on her mouth @entity54 was a ritual that took place upon the death of an @entity13 king			1
the local lords were required to select unblemished children representing the ideal of human perfection			2
children were married and presented with sets of miniature human and llama figurines in gold , silver , copper and shell			2
the male figures have elongated earlobes and a braided headband and the female figurines wore their hair in plaited			0
the children were then returned to their original communities , where they were honoured before being sacrificed to the mountain gods on the @entity79 ( pictured )			2
known as the @entity81 , she is one of three children found in stone tombs on a mountain in @entity85			1
the girl , the eldest of the three , was found cross-legged , with her head slumped forward and her hands resting in her lap. she wore a feather headdress over her tightly braided hair and there were coca leaves between her teeth and balled up behind her cheek			1
the children were discovered in 1999			1
they are believed to have been sacrificed in a ceremony called capacocha , a ritual thought to have been used to instil fear and help control members of the rapidly expanding @entity13			1
analysis of the children ’s hair , which still contains a chemical fingerprint of their diet , shows that all three were plied with drugs and alcohol to subdue them in the months before they died			0
amounts were particularly high in the 13 - year - old girl , perhaps because she showed more resistance			0
the chemical analysis was carried out by researchers at the @entity114 , and published in the journal @entity116			0
the researchers said the coca leaves , which release a mild stimulant when chewed and sucked , would have helped her cope with the demands of altitude			1
the three children of @entity24 , who were deep frozen rather than embalmed , were also found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold , silver and shell statues , textiles and pots containing food the trio - whose selection was a great honour - were brought to the summit of @entity134 in the @entity19 which lies near the @entity136 border where they were put to death in a ritual called capacocha the older girl 's face - which showed red ochre markings - was creased from the place it rested on her shawl the chicha , an alcoholic drink made from fermented maize , would have helped her deal with the cold			1
but it could also have hastened her death by stopping her from shivering			0
there is no evidence that the girl , known as the @entity24 after the mountain in northwest @entity85 , was brutally killed			1
instead , it is thought she died of exposure			0
priests would have waited for her to fall unconscious before placing her in a burial chamber			0
dr @entity163 , from the @entity114 , said : ‘ we think it likely that the @entity45 was selected for sacrifice 12 months before her death , after which her treatment changed , corresponding to the sharp rise in coca consumption			0
‘ she was then probably involved in a series of rituals , involving consumption of coca and alcohol in the build up to her sacrifice			0
‘ both substances were controlled , were considered elite products			0
‘ the fact that in her final weeks the maiden shows consistently higher levels of coca and alcohol use compared to the younger children suggests there was a greater need to sedate her in the final weeks of life			1

*archaeologists* discover traces of coca leaves and beer in @entity13 mummies
the mummies of the three children were discovered in 1999 in @entity85
they are the best *naturally* preserved group of mummies found so far
