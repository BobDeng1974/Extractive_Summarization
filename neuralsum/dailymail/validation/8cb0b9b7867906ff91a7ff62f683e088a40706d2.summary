@entity0 has unveiled its watch today in what is the company 's first completely new product since the death of founder @entity6			1
a press event held in @entity8 revealed the collection that will range in price from $ 349 to $ 17,000 ( £ 299 to £ 13,500 in the @entity11 )			1
it comes in three models : the @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , and all are sold in either 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions			1
the devices are due to go on sale on april 24 , but how do they compare to rivals ' smartwatches ? and can @entity0 crack the market that has only seen limited sales to date ? here @entity25 looks at its main competitors in the increasingly crowded market			1
@entity0 's watch is available in three models : the watch , @entity15 and @entity16 ( shown ) and all models will be sold in 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions			1
@entity14 is made of stainless steel , @entity15 is made of @entity33 and the premium edition comes in 18 - @entity35 and @entity36 moto 360 the @entity37 watch launched in september 2014 and won praise for its stylish , circular design that was seen as being a move away from the bulky and computerised - looking @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity16			1
it features a 1.5in lcd touchscreen encircled by a thin metal band and is powered by @entity48 's @entity47 operating system			2
the @entity37 360 - which is available now in the @entity49 - is also $ 100 cheaper than the @entity14			1
despite its impressive design and promises that the watch lasts for 24 hours , tests have shown this averages at around 12 - six hours less than the @entity14 and almost two days shorter than the @entity54 like with @entity0 's watch , batter life depends on usage			1
the device reviews at the time of its launch were mixed			2
' like all other watches in this class , you 'll have to get used to charging every night , and occasionally you 'll need to top off during the day , ' wrote @entity63			0
' the display resolution is n't as good as other choices			0
and the @entity47 software itself is still is in its infancy			0
' the @entity37 launched last year and is available for $ 250 in the @entity49 and £ 199 in the @entity11 @entity68 @entity42 - the world 's biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smartphones to counter slow earnings in its mobile sector			1
this included the @entity77 that was released in september 2013			0
despite their early foray into the market , their appeal and functionality was limited and the @entity77 was too big for even the largest wrists			0
the @entity68 was unveiled in august 2014 its new watch is called the @entity68 and has a larger curved amoled screen than its predecessors at two inches ( 5cm )			1
it is designed to fit more comfortably on the wearer 's wrist than its previous models			0
the watch is large enough so that users will be able to read messages and notifications at a glance			2
the screen can be customised – as well as the colour of the straps			0
it offers @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity104 connectivity , so that users can receive notifications from social networks , calendars and apps , without needing to use their smartphone			0
people wearing the device can reply to messages by using an onscreen keyboard or 's voice functionality ' so they can dictate a message			0
engineer and tech expert @entity117 from @entity119 told @entity25 : ' @entity0 are @entity120 at the moment ; you either love them or hate them			1
' most @entity47 fans fall in the latter category , and they 'll probably go straight for anything that comes with the @entity42 badge on it			0
' the watch is the cheapest on the market at $ 199 and has an impressive battery life of two to three days , meaning users do not have to charge their watch every night			1
however , the watches run on @entity135 , a fledgling mobile operating system , rather than @entity48 's @entity47 software			0
@entity138 @entity16 joined @entity139 as the latest manufacturer to release a smartwatch with a round face in september last year			0
it runs @entity47 , has a 1.3in diameter touchscreen and comes with @entity144 of storage			0
as well as being waterproof , the watch features a heart - rate sensor on the rear , but does n't have a gps sensor			2
it connects to any @entity47 phone running 4.3 or higher , via @entity102 , and can also be controlled using voice commands			0
at $ 332 it is more expensive than the @entity37 and the @entity154 , but is still cheaper than the @entity14			1
' @entity47 needs more work , ' said @entity156 at @entity157			0
' it feels odd talking to your wrist and the price tag is hard to swallow			2
the @entity161 is available with a choice of two straps , the first is made from leather , while the second is a metallic - link strap @entity168 watch the @entity169 is powered by @entity47 , has a 1.4 - inch touchscreen and comes with a built - in heart rate monitor			2
the crown , frame and hinge are made of scratch - resistant stainless steel and there will be 40 watch faces to choose from when it launches later this year			2
the watch will be available later this year across @entity180 , @entity181 and the @entity49 although the exact date and price information has not been announced			1
the 1.4 - inch display has a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels , giving it a 286 pixel - per - inch ( @entity188 ) density			0
by comparison , the @entity37 which also has a circular screen has a @entity188 of 205			1
@entity188 is an indicator of image sharpness , clarity and colour and the higher the number , the better			0
the firm has not yet revealed battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device			1
last week , @entity25 's @entity200 tested the gadget at @entity202 in @entity203			0
' the screen is bright and clear , but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this , ' she said			0
' there will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and i can see it being popular with both sexes			1
previous watches such as the @entity37 feel more masculine , for example			2
' @entity168 would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success , but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch i ’ve seen			1
' @entity168 chief executive @entity225 , pictured , unveiled the watch in @entity203 earlier this month			2
