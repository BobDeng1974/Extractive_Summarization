warning : deputy labour leader @entity0 said women should ' beware ' of @entity2 @entity4 's leading feminist has launched a provocative attack on @entity2 as a party led by ' neanderthal sexists '			1
deputy leader @entity0 said women should ' beware ' of @entity2 , which tolerated ' appalling ' anti-female remarks and offered a policy platform that was ' bad for women '			1
some 90 per cent of candidates selected so far by the @entity15 party for the @entity16 are male , as are 81 per cent of its 360 councillors and 71 per cent of @entity19 , according to a new @entity4 analysis			1
miss @entity0 criticised those women @entity2 does have in senior roles – such as communities spokeswoman @entity2 – for representing a party that she said wanted to take their sex ' backwards '			1
miss @entity2 , @entity2 's deputy chairman , accused @entity25 of a ' vicious and completely uncalled for outburst ' and branded her ' @entity27 '			2
@entity4 's attack represents its latest attempt to counter the threat from @entity2 in many of its northern seats by going after its weakest flank			1
mr @entity36 admitted late last year that his party has a women problem in terms of its appeal to voters , saying that @entity2 could at times come across as a bit ' blokeish '			1
but he compounded the problem by making what was condemned by critics as another sexist comment , asking : ' what do you want me to do ? go sell flowers ? ' evidence from polls ahead of the @entity54 and @entity55 by - election early in october suggested @entity2 was ahead of @entity4 by 41 per cent to 38 per cent among male voters , but trailing with just 21 per cent support from women			1
@entity4 went on to take the seat			2
miss @entity0 said : ' women should beware of @entity2			1
it 's a backwards party run by dinosaurs who clearly expect men to be running the show and women to be obeying them			1
' it 's clear from their policies and what they say , and what they do that @entity2 is bad for women			2
' it 's not just the @entity78 sexist comments , and their overwhelmingly male team of candidates -- their policies show no recognition that half the people in this country are women and that women expect , and are entitled , to be treated on equal terms to men			2
it 's a party frozen in time			2
' @entity4 cited remarks by @entity89 , an mep , who claimed women ' do n't have the ambition to go right to the top because something gets in the way … it 's called a baby '			1
former treasurer and party donor @entity96 questioned the performance of women in business and sport , claiming : ' chess , bridge , poker – women come absolutely nowhere			0
i think that has to be borne in mind … it may be that women are not as competitive			0
' slammed : miss @entity0 criticised senior women in @entity2 – such as @entity2 ( right ) – for representing a party that she said wanted to take their sex ' backwards '			1
left , @entity2 leader @entity36 mr @entity36 , meanwhile , has said women in the @entity116 are worth ' far less to the employer ' if they have a child ' and take two or three years off work ' and made controversial remarks about ' ostentatious ' breastfeeding in public places			2
miss @entity0 also cited @entity2 's call for deeper public service cuts , which she said would hit women hardest , and criticised the party 's alliance with the @entity127 in the @entity128			1
members include @entity130 , from the @entity131 , whose leader until a few weeks ago was @entity133			0
he has said women ' should not have the right to vote ' and claimed that ' when women say no , they do n't always mean it '			0
comments : former @entity2 treasurer and party donor @entity96 ( pictured ) questioned the performance of women in business and sport @entity4 's analysis of @entity146 candidates shows that 344 of 383 selected candidates are male			1
a @entity2 candidate is more likely to be called ' @entity149 ' , ' @entity150 ' or ' @entity151 ' than be a woman			0
miss @entity2 said : ' this is an extraordinary outburst , vicious and completely uncalled for - i 'm beginning to see why even her own colleagues call her @entity27			0
' i do n't believe she 's ever met @entity36 , but if she had , and if she 'd worked with him , as i do , she 'd find he 's extremely knowledgeable , great company , has a wonderful sense of humour and is an all - round decent chap			0
he no more believes women are worth less than i do			0
his supposed ' anti-women ' comments have been spun out of all proportion			0
' @entity2 is not sexist			0
if @entity2 was sexist , i would n't be deputy chairman and handed the huge responsiblity of delivering the general election manifesto			0
' we would n't have seven female meps , all of them selected to stand by our members			0
and we certainly would n't have more frontbench spokeswomen than any other national party			0
' our spokeswomen have gritty roles too - transport and business , for example , not the usual fluffy ' women 's issues ' roles that other parties have so patronisingly handed out on many occasions			0
' like other women in @entity2 , i can be confident i 'm doing the job i 'm doing because i was chosen to do it on merit , not because of ridiculous and demeaning quotas that mean i tick the right equality box			2
that 's what @entity4 's policies have reduced women to and it infuriates me			1
' they 've put women out of work ; forced down wages for women because of mass uncontrolled migration , they 've raised our taxes , helped make childcare the most expensive in the world , and not properly addressed the issue of women suffering appalling cultural crimes like female genital mutilation			0

@entity4 's @entity0 said @entity2 tolerated ' appalling ' anti-female remarks
criticised senior @entity2 women , saying party wanted to take sex ' backwards '
nine in 10 @entity2 candidates selected so far for @entity16 are male
