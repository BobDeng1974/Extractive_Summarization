by @entity0 for @entity1 one more casualty of the @entity4 system			2
@entity5 , a 76 - year - old @entity6 veteran , was kept waiting at the @entity7 for a biopsy to determine whether a blemish on his nose was cancerous			1
two and a half years later , the cancer had progressed so far that 70 % of his nose needed to be removed , @entity5 told @entity13			1
at the clinic , the biopsy was repeatedly delayed			2
the cancer spread through much of the nose , requiring immediate surgery			1
the reconstructive surgery left @entity5 using a popsicle stick to prop open his left nostril			1
the @entity22 where @entity5 went for treatment was at the center of a scandal in april after @entity13 connected the deaths of 40 veterans to hidden waiting lists			1
dr. @entity37 , a former @entity22 doctor , blew the whistle on the facility for keeping two waiting lists , one with the actual list of patients awaiting care , the other with patients ready to receive care in the next 14 days			0
@entity37 says the dummy lists were sent to @entity48 to create the illusion that the hospital saw patients within an acceptable waiting time , which is normally considered 14 to 30 days			0
an investigation of the delays by the @entity54 ' @entity55 blasted ' clinically significant delays ' for dozens of veterans but did not conclude the delays led to any deaths			0
@entity5 says he relies on va care since his only other insurance option now is @entity62 , which does not cover outpatient care			0

@entity5 , 76 , uses a popsicle stick to prop open his left nostril after reconstructive surgery
the @entity4 referred @entity5 to the dermatology clinic to conduct a biopsy , but it took four visits over two and a half years , and by then cancer had spread through much of his nose
the @entity7 where @entity5 was treated also was found to be using a secret waiting list earlier this year
@entity13 reported that at least 40 veterans died as a result of delays connected to the list
