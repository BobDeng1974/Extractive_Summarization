mrs @entity1 , who works at the @entity34 said : ' losing a child is possibly the worst thing you can go through			1
' when a child is really sick it is a horrendous experience to go through but the only thing i can say it that in most situations parents can see if coming - they have warning - yet we had no warning			2
' her dream was to go on @entity47 - that ’s is the one thing she wanted to do			2
' she had passions for everything			2
every night she going to some club or activity			2
she loved kick - boxing and to swimming and cubs most nights			2
' there needs to be more done to identify or ensure there are ways of detecting sads as we do n’t wish any other parents to go through this			2
' a lot of footballers are getting checked for underlying heart conditions and even @entity10 was checked before he suffered from it and nothing came up			0

her family say she loved to sing and dance and dreamed of being a star ' @entity73 is a great project raising awareness but one of the few			1
' there is still very little on the internet on it			0
when you look for a charity there are reams and reams but when you look for this there is about one website with hardly anything on it			0
' in this day and age with information available at the tip of your fingers there should be more on it			0
there is very little data			0

' @entity1 's brother @entity119 ( centre ) and friends at the @entity155 which they did to raise money for charity she added : “ one of the things we are looking at is whether we have passed it down to @entity1			1
i had arrhythmia but that can be physically seen			0
' you could have a check - up and medical test and nothing would actually present at all and a few weeks later you could just drop			2
it is like turning a light switch off			0
in around 1 in every 20 cases of sudden cardiac death - up to 500 every year in the @entity171 - no cause can be found , despite examination of the heart by an expert cardiac pathologist			1
the cause of death is therefore described as ' unascertainable '			0
this is called @entity179 , or @entity8			1

it might not be that			0
' it may be the case that she is the first in the family to have it			2
but we now have to make sure @entity216 is n’t at risk			0
' a few weeks before @entity1 ’s funeral , her father , building supervisor @entity120 , 48 , found an email on her tablet of a song she recorded which she had emailed to a friend for her birthday			1
her mum said : ' we found the song , it was quite crackly , so we sent it to get it cleaned up			2
' we actually put it on a cd and played it at the funeral			0
. it was the theme tune from a tv programme called @entity236			0
it was talking about being tomorrow ’s fascination and ‘ remember me			0
’ ' the words were so poignant			0
it was brilliant because we wanted it to be her performance - she starred in her own show			2
