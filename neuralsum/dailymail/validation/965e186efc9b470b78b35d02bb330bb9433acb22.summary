former @entity1 netball captain @entity0 has championed a controversial netball ad after critics claim it draws uncomfortable parallels to a domestic violence ad			1
the @entity8 ad , which is promoting the upcoming @entity9 , depicts diamonds star @entity10 with a badly blackened eye			1
an injury ms @entity0 claims she earned ' giving her all ' in training earlier that week			1
‘ i love the ad , ’ ms @entity0 told @entity14			2
ms @entity0 penned a column for @entity31 defending the controversial ad after critics claimed ms @entity10 ’s bruised and bloodshot left eye was distasteful			1
she hit back saying more people need to recognise that these highly trained athletes are not only capable of putting their body on the line , but they love it			2
‘ i think people do n’t want to emphasise the fact that it is a physical game and women can go hard			0
’ @entity1 tv journalist @entity43 claims the ad could have conveyed the message that womens sport is tough without such a ' confronting image			2
’ @entity43 likened the sports injury to one sustained at the hands of an abuser @entity0 is adamant that women play with a level of physicality that can sometimes lead to injuries ‘ it screams violence not toughness , ’ she said in an article on her website			2
respectfully disagreeing , ms @entity0 said it would be a mistake to see elite female athletes , playing with the ferocity that men would , and assume it 's an act of violence			1
' the game is n’t violent , the players do n’t go out there to inflict pain , there is no malice			0
netball is a tough game and that ’s what it portrays			1
' ' i do n’t think this conversation would have happened if it were a blokes sport , ' she added			0
@entity80 users expressed their support by backing ms @entity0 ' claims that women and girls can be tough on court			2
star player @entity10 sustained the controversial eye injury in a training session and was offered to cover it up with make up before shooting the ad			1
she declined as she saw no reason to cover up the realities of the game			0
ms @entity0 says people do n't want to emphasise the level of physicality involved in netball ms @entity0 said she was elated to see a role model for young girls who can say ' look at what i can do , not at how i look '			1
' this is so vital because of the way society is			0
little girls from a young age are reinforced that it ’s all about how you look , ' she told @entity14			0
' what sport does is that it flips it from what your body looks like to what your body can actually do			0
how high can you jump ? how fast can you run ? how far can you throw ? ' ms @entity0 wants young girls to focus less on what they look like on court and more on what their body can actually do the ad highlights the athletes physical prowess but has been heavily criticised while ms @entity0 is adamant this particular ad does n't trivialise domestic violence , she said can see why people would assume ' that when a woman is bruised she is a victim			1
' ms @entity0 said the notion of domestic violence is becoming ' all pervasive ' due to the unfortunate fact that it is far more likely for a woman to suffer injuries at the hand of a partner than on a netball court			1
‘ we ca n’t ask people to change that perception until women are n’t victims			0
and that ’s where we have to start , ’ she added			0
the # likeagirl campaign , which the ad is loosely based off , took off in june last year after releasing a video which challenges the perception of what the phrase " like a girl " means .			0

ad for @entity150 shows star @entity10 with black eye
ms @entity10 sustained the injury playing netball and did n't want to cover it
critics likened the ad to domestic violence campaigns
netball *-* great @entity0 hit back saying it shows the reality of the game
' netball is a tough game and that ’s what it portrays , ' says ms @entity0
