by @entity0 step aside @entity1 , there 's a new healthy - eating beauty in town as @entity6 's sexiest female vegan has been named as @entity7			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity9 has won the unusual title after beating competition from around the country to win the contest , organised by animal rights charity @entity14			1
@entity15 admits it was the film @entity17 that inspired her to change her eating habits when she was just five - years - old			1
victory : @entity7 has been named the sexiest female vegan of 2014 ditched meat and dairy aged five : the 24 - year - old was compelled to become a vegan after watching the film @entity17 after becoming enamored with the screen pig , she ditched meat , milk and eggs and encouraged her family do to the same			1
so how did her mother react to her rejecting such foods at such a young age ? ' my mum found it easy changing all of our diets , as she grew up next to a slaughterhouse so did n't feel comfortable eating meat anyway , ' @entity15 explains			1
' to be honest i think it 's weird that people still eat meat at all			0
there are so many choices out there			0
' health benefits : @entity15 said being vegan has given her good skin , thicker hair and a slim figure she added : ' i 'm happy with a bowl of mango , strawberries and figs , but if i want comfort food , i go with salt and chilli tofu and broccoli stir - fried with garlic			2
' blonde @entity15 said she entered the competition to prove that vegans are ' normal ' but never expected to win			2
she said : ' i know people have certain ideas about vegans so i hope this competition shows that we are just normal people			2
i do n't actually think i 'm that sexy but i thought i 'd give it a go			0
i just ca n't believe i actually won			2
' the association of chartered certified accountants employee credits her veganism for her good looks			0
sexiest male : @entity72 took the men 's title following a public vote compassionate : the former soldier is now a wildlife artist she said : ' it 's mostly ethical reasons i 'm a vegan but the health benefits alone would make me stay on this diet			1
i have much more energy , my skin has improved , my hair is thicker and i 've lost weight - although that was n't really an aim for me			0
' meanwhile , the title of sexiest vegan male was awarded to former soldier @entity72 , 27 , who turned vegan after witnessing suffering in @entity92 and @entity93			1
now a wildlife artist , @entity94 , from @entity95 , posts about animal rights issues on social media			1
he said : ' seeing the violence humans inflict upon each other is yet another reason i 've chosen to live as peacefully as i can by being vegan			2
' the sheer number of animals suffering for our stomachs is far greater than any other cause i 've supported , and as such , i feel it deserves the most urgent attention			0
what could be sexier than a man who puts compassion first ? ' competition : @entity112 , 23 , from @entity113 was a finalist better luck next time : @entity115 , 29 , from @entity116 , gunned for extra votes with the cunning use of a cute baby prop the winner were chosen by a public vote after @entity14 whittled down the entrants to eight finalists ( four men and four women )			1
the two winners will each receive a night for two and lunch at the @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 , plus a vegan dinner for two at @entity129 's @entity133 restaurant			2
@entity14 @entity6 associate director @entity134 said : ' on average , vegans are healthier and have more energy than meat - eaters do - and that makes them sexier , too			1
' congratulations to our two winners			0
but in our book , all the entrants are winners			0
they are enjoying all the health benefits of vegan food while living compassionately every day			2
' the other female entrants were @entity112 , 23 , from @entity113 , who describes herself as , ' a cat lady , artist , adventurer and soldier in the karma army '			1

' whilst their @entity174 , @entity154 - @entity154 , 24 , hopes and believes that one day all animals will be treated as equals			1

' @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 are all vegan , as well as other celebrities , which may have an influence			0
