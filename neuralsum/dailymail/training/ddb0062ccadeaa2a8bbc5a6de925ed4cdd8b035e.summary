by @entity1 reporter published : 01:09 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 01:22 est , 7 september 2013 the relatives of a woman who died mysteriously have aired their suspicions about her husband as they believe that he had something to do with her death			1
dr @entity10 's fifth wife @entity9 died in their @entity12 bedroom following days of unexplained pain and now her relatives are still waiting for justice			1
he has never been charged with any crimes in connection to her death and maintains that he is innocent , but her relatives painted a far more sinister picture of the four - year marriage that ended with @entity9 unconscious , face down on their bedroom floor			1
her relatives told 20/20 that since @entity9 's death in 2010 , her relatives have discovered that ' he soaked her dry ' both before and after she died - cashing in on a $ 100,000 life insurrance policy and having her use her $ 500,000 in liquid assets that she had going into the marriage to buy their home and bankroll their life together			1
marriage number five : @entity9 and @entity10 met each other just three months before they got married in 2006 , and the union was the fifth marriage for both			1
four years later , she was dead			0
@entity9 's daughter @entity37 said that they were wary of @entity10 's financial footing even before her mother decided to marry him			1
murky career : in the early 1990s , dr @entity10 was found guilty of arson when he set his chiropractor 's office on fire ' he came into the marriage with the clothes on his back			2
and he 's a doctor ? ' mrs @entity37 told @entity50			0
her relatives were hesitant when @entity9 rushed into her marriage with @entity10 in 2006 after just a three month courtship			1
adding to that , she had her own share of relationship issues in the past , as this was also her fifth marriage			0
her fourth husband @entity59 had left her $ 1million following his death , and while she never told her relatives that she felt used during her four year marriage to @entity10 , they found out after her death			1
when mrs @entity37 was looking for answers - searching her mother 's house in @entity66 , @entity12 for her original will - she stumbled upon her mother 's personal journals			0
' how much longer am i going to have to financially support this man ? he said he was n't going to do this to me			0
he said he was going to get a job			0
he 's constantly spending my money			0
lord when is he going to get a job ? ' @entity9 wrote in one entry , according to her daughter			2
the 20/20 investigation proved that his apparent money problems started much earlier , before his marriage to @entity9			2
a former police officer told @entity50 that in the early 1990s , he saw smoke coming from @entity10 's medical office in @entity85 , @entity86			2
rather than calling police to report an alleged crime - as he claimed that someone attacked him inside his office and set the place on fire during the altercation - the officer saw @entity10 just standing across the street watching the fire			2
caring : @entity9 , who had inherited $ 1million when her fourth husband died , was an evangelist and a ' giver ' the women that came before : his first wife ( @entity101 ) died from choking on a cough drop , his second ( @entity105 ) got a divorce after three years ; @entity107 said he hit her with a mallet while she was sleeping			1
his fourth ( @entity111 ) said she thought he was poisoning her @entity10 also smelled of diesel fuel , which was later discovered to be the cause of the fire			2
@entity10 was charged with arson and put on 15 years probation , in addition to having his license revoked			1
after the guilty verdict was handed down , he allegedly threatened the officer			0
now , two of his other ex wives say that he also showed violent behavior during their marriages - facts that they did not disclose during the investigation into @entity9 's death			1
his third wife , @entity127 , was married to him from 1981 to 1995			0
when contacted by @entity9 's daughter , she said that he once hit her with a mallet in the back of her head and then tried to smother her in their bed			1
@entity127 said that she was hospitalized after the incident and told doctors that she fell in the shower			0
scary : @entity10 's third wife @entity127 told @entity50 that even though he attacked her in her sleep one night - which he said was a side effect of being stung by jellyfish in @entity142 - she stayed married to him for another decade before getting divorced different stories : @entity10 had previously told @entity9 's family that he was holding his first wife @entity101 's ( pictured ) hand when she died of leukemia			1
they later found out she died from choking on a throat losange when she later asked what he was doing , @entity127 said that he gave an unbelievable reason : ‘ he told me he had gotten stung by jellyfish when he was in @entity142 and that it was a reaction to the toxins			0
’ she did not leave him until a decade later - a move that she can not rationally explain now , but when she did finally divorce him , she told police about the mallet incident and now has a restraining order against him			0
@entity10 's fourth wife , @entity160 , was the woman he divorced just months before marrying @entity9			1
she told police that while she did not have firm proof , she felt that her regular migranes got significantly worse during her marriage to @entity10 and she felt he played a role in her pain			2
' i think that the man 's dangerous , personally , ' she told police			0
' i get migraine headaches , okay ? and it 's documented that i do			0
but they were so bad when i lived with him , i , i could n't even work , i could hardly function			0
' and i 'll be honest with you ... if something happens to me , he needs to be investigated			0
' mrs @entity160 's complaint resonated even more strongly with @entity9 's relatives because they were the same symptoms she complained of before her death			1
during the investigation , @entity10 told police that in the days leading up to her death , @entity9 had been feeling ill and having one of her bi-annual bouts of migranes			1
odd symptoms : in the days leading up to her death , @entity9 had been suffering from severe migraines			1
her autopsy reported she had multiple blunt force head injuries suspicions : @entity9 's daughter @entity189 suspects that @entity10 killed her mother - and that he was having an affair with his current ( sixth ) wife at the time of @entity9 's death her mother and brother made a surprise visit to the home that @entity9 and @entity10 shared in @entity66 to check in on her			1
they said that she felt so ill that she could not even get out of bed to greet them			0
when they arrived , @entity10 said that he had been out of town but when he got back he saw that a potted plant had been broken and he believed @entity9 had possibly fallen down the stairs			1
she denied falling down the stairs			0
@entity9 ’s symptoms had improved by the time she said goodnight to her relatives on sunday february 28 , 2010			1
the next morning , they awoke to @entity10 screaming that his wife was unconscious			2
@entity10 had been sleeping on the couch , and on that monday morning he said he went into the bedroom and found his wife lying on the floor , unconscious , and her lips were already blue when he saw her			2
this was not his first wife who died under unusual circumstances either			0
throughout his marriage to @entity9 , he had told her and her relatives that his first wife , @entity101 , died of leukemia			2
he added that he was holding her hand when she succumbed to the cancer			0
out and about : @entity10 now lives with his sixth wife @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity86 and has never been charged in connection to @entity9 's death , but the case has now been reopened following her mother ’s death , mrs @entity189 found an old newspaper clipping that reported that @entity233 died after choking on a cough drop at the age of 25			1
the cause of death for @entity9 was not as clear , however , as an autopsy listed the cause of death was inconclusive but that she had a series of blunt force head injuries			1
‘ man , i hate to say this , but i think someone murdered my sister , ’ @entity9 ’s brother @entity243 told 20/20			0
the @entity12 attorney general has now reopened the investigation into @entity9 ’s death , though the former chiropractor no longer lives in the state			2
@entity10 now lives in @entity226 , @entity86 with his sixth wife , @entity225 - the woman who mrs @entity189 now believes @entity10 was having an affair with at the end of his marriage to her mother			0
‘ there ’s no question in my mind that @entity10 killed this woman , ’ his third wife @entity127 told @entity50			0

@entity9 died in 2010 after being married to her husband for four years
her family now suspects her ex , @entity10 , is in someway *responsible* for the mysterious death
autopsy reveals blunt force head *traumas* but no clear cause of death
