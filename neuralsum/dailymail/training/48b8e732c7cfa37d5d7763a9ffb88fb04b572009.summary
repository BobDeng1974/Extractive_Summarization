@entity0 is breaking one of its major post-war taboos by announcing there will be an annual @entity4 to remember fallen soldiers			1
the country 's defence minister has unleashed a storm of criticism from opposition politicians and pacifists who object to the army being honoured given @entity0 's bloody past in the 20th century			1
@entity0 defence minister @entity14 has proposed may 22 as an annual veterans ’ day to honour former soldiers living and dead			1
taboo : @entity0 will have an annual @entity4 to remember fallen soldiers , including those pictured here who invaded @entity21 in 1938 this would mean honouring those troops of both world wars who acted as aggressors - and in the case of the @entity28 in @entity29 - often as criminals			1
' against the background of our operations and the questions they pose our society , it is time to speak objectively and openly about our veterans ' policy , ' @entity14 said			0
the centre - left @entity40 is against the move			0
' i 'm sceptical whether there can be a day that really reaches society , ' said @entity40 defence spokesman @entity47			0
' if the defence minister wants to do something for former soldiers , he should get some money and improve their social security , instead of invoking some cheap ' ideal honour ' , ' said left party defence spokesman @entity54			2
tributes : @entity0 soldiers , such as these ones engaged in the trenches in the @entity59 , will be honours on the @entity4 the @entity61 was equally scathing			1
their defence expert @entity62 called the @entity4 nothing but a ' fig - leaf ' for a minister who is ' avoiding his core duties '			0
he condemned the @entity4 as ' superfluous ' , unless it was used to open a debate on military operations abroad - and also honoured development workers and diplomats abroad			0
@entity0 's first foreign military mission since @entity29 took place in 1991 during the second @entity73			1
since then since 300,000 @entity0 soldiers have been in action abroad and more than 100 have been killed			2
more than 5million @entity0 servicemen fell in @entity29 , and 2million in the @entity59			2
there has not been a specific day to honour the military dead ever since the @entity79 fell in 1945 .			0

may 22 will honour @entity0 's living and dead soldiers
anger at army being honoured , given bloody *history*
