i have a different opinion			0
' we had six or seven clear chances to score at the beginning			0
i think we played very well			0
' after they scored the goal we were disorderly and they had another counter-attack and they could score more goals			2
' but it is very easy to say that ( about @entity4 )			1
i do n't think that is the reason			0
' you can analyse the game and if you think that is the reason , that is your reason but i have a different opinion from that			0
