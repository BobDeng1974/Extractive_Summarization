@entity0 , the former manager of @entity1 , is the surprise name on the short - list for the vacant job at @entity5			1
@entity0 , 46 , was considered by @entity6 as a successor to @entity8 , before the appointment of @entity10			1
now he is set for discussions with @entity5 owner @entity12 , who sacked @entity13 on saturday , following the 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity16			1
he has a win record of 22.4 per cent , and 70 points from a possible 228			0
credit : @entity29 parish will open talks with @entity0 , although he is believed to be one of a number of candidates			2
@entity5 would not rule out a return for @entity36 – although their former manager would have to make the first move , unlikely given his comments on saturday			1
and there were rumours emanating from the north - east today that former player @entity43 could be a contender , although the £ 5m compensation clause in his contract would make a huge dent in @entity5 ’s budget for the january transfer window			1
parish knows the appointment of @entity0 would be a gamble , given his lack of @entity23 experience			1
aside from a recent spell at @entity56 in @entity57 , his entire coaching career has been spent in @entity58 , often at youth level or among backroom staff			0
he was assistant to @entity61 at @entity1 , inheriting the job when he left to take over @entity63 in 2011			2
@entity64 6/4 @entity65 6/1 @entity36 7/1 @entity66 8/1 @entity67 10/1 @entity68 12/1 @entity69 12/1 @entity70 20/1 @entity71 20/1 source : coral ; odds are subject to change @entity0 then won back to back titles at @entity1 , but disappointed in @entity77 , and quit in summer 2013 after missing out on the @entity6 job			1
he spent a year in @entity57 and was succeeded at @entity56 by @entity79			0
@entity0 is currently without a club , meaning he could start immediately , but @entity5 want time to consider other candidates and have already determined that @entity68 will be in charge for the matches with @entity84 and @entity85			1
@entity86 boss @entity43 is also a contender to replace @entity13 at @entity5 august 16 : @entity87 2 - 1 @entity5 august 23 : @entity5 1 - 3 @entity88 august 30 : @entity86 3 - 3 @entity5 september 13 : @entity5 0 - 0 @entity89 september 21 : @entity6 2 - 3 @entity5 september 27 : @entity5 2 - 0 @entity90 october 4 : @entity91 2 - 0 @entity5 october 18 : @entity5 1 - 2 @entity63 october 25 : @entity92 2 - 2 @entity5 november 3 : @entity5 1 - 3 @entity93 november 8 : @entity94 1 - 0 @entity5 november 23 : @entity5 3 - 1 @entity95 november 29 : @entity96 1 - 1 @entity5 december 2 : @entity5 0 - 1 @entity85 december 6 : @entity97 0 - 0 @entity5 december 13 : @entity5 1 - 1 @entity98 december 20 : @entity99 3 - 0 @entity5 december 26 : @entity5 1 - 3 @entity16 the @entity5 dropped into the bottom three of the @entity23 on @entity101 after a 3 - 1 loss to @entity16 , with pressure mounting on @entity13 and fans calling for his head			1

it said : ' @entity5 can today confirm that @entity13 has been relieved of his duties and is no longer first - team manager			1
' the club would like to put on record its thanks to @entity13 for all his hard work and energy over the past four months			2
' @entity68 will lead the team against @entity84 tomorrow [ sunday ] as caretaker manager			2
' @entity5 chairman @entity12 ( right ) has made the decision to sack @entity13 after a poor start @entity121 plays his final game for @entity5 against @entity84 , before captaining @entity123 in the @entity124 ' we got on a bus and before we got to the hotel the driver said he had a message from his boss that he would n't take us to the ground unless i paid for the bus			1
that 's the last time i was at @entity86			2
i have n't got my money back for that bus by the way ! ' - ahead of his first match back in charge of @entity5 , at @entity86 , @entity13 recalls learning how the club had slipped into administration ahead of his last visit to @entity143 with the @entity5 in 2010			1
' i think that 's why they threw the last goal in , so they did n't go to @entity99 away			2
we heard the score ' - @entity13 was frustrated after the @entity150 stadium announcer told fans the winner of their @entity154 match against @entity86 - still ongoing at the time - would face @entity99 , who were fresh off a 7 - 0 win over @entity157			1
' i have not seen something like that since @entity160 ' - a furious @entity13 condemns @entity162 's challenge on goalkeeper @entity163 during @entity5 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity92 on october 25			1
' i do n't really know what a billionaire could do for @entity5 - i have only been here six weeks			2
you 'd better ask the chairman			0
there are not a lot of billionaires in @entity172 ' - @entity13 reacts to speculation linking @entity175 @entity174 with a takeover of @entity5			1
' i am looking forward to going back on @entity177 and @entity178 after ( finishing as a manager ) , when you can say what you want and enjoy it ' - @entity13 reacts to an improper conduct charge from the @entity184 relating to his post-match comments after the 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity63			1
' i ca n't afford to keep giving my wife the same amount of money as the fine ; it 's a double whammy for me ' - and @entity13 later reveals he must also pay his wife the equivalent of any @entity184 fine after being made to pay £ 9,000 for those post-match remarks			1
' he does n't know what he 's going to do next , so the full - back does n't have a chance , does he ? ' - @entity199 's unorthodox style earns his manager 's praise			2
' one of the press guys told me this morning that on @entity205 's @entity204 he says he 's agreed ( to sign a new contract ) so somebody at the club will tell me eventually			0
unfortunately @entity209 ca n't tweet me but no doubt he 'll let me know			0
it 's good news if it is true ' - @entity13 reacts to reports of a new contract for @entity215			1
' as long as they play well i 'm sure managers do n't care what they wear			0
i 'm surprised at christmas time that we have n't got a pair of boots with flashing lights ! ' - in one of his final @entity5 press conferences , @entity13 has a new suggestion for football boot designers			1
speaking to the @entity228 , chairman @entity12 revealed the reason behind the sacking , while admitting that it is a priority to start negotiations with a new manager immediately			0
' we have let @entity13 go and we have thanked him for his work , ' the @entity5 owner said			1
' it 's not working out and we are looking for a reaction against @entity84			0
' i slept on it really and just spoke to a few people and made my mind up this morning			0
@entity13 is a great guy and he wanted to do it at @entity5			1
it just has n't happened			0
' it just was n't working			0
you always want it sorted out as soon as possible but i have n't got anyone lined up			0
we want to hold negotiations as soon as possible			0
' @entity13 has therefore become the first managerial casualty of the @entity23 season , taking charge of just 16 league games in his second stint at @entity150			2
@entity68 will take temporary charge of @entity5 when they travel to @entity84 on sunday the substitution of winger @entity199 for full - back @entity252 , when @entity5 were 3 - 0 down to @entity16 , saw fans call for @entity13 's head on @entity101			1
chants of ' you do n't know what you 're doing ' rang around @entity150 , while sections of the home fans booed at the full - time whistle			0
@entity13 was honest in his assessment of the performance though , admitting that he expected a negative response from the palace faithful			2
' i have no complaints , at 3 - 0 down , you 'd be very surprised not to get a bit of stick			0
i thought the players were very good today in the circumstances , they were almost as shell - shocked as some of the fans			0
' @entity278 's third goal for @entity16 was the last @entity13 would concede as @entity5 manager sunday would have seen @entity13 ( centre ) return to his old club @entity84 caretaker boss @entity68 is now in a position familiar to him , after two previous stints as caretaker manager at @entity150			1
after the departures of @entity286 and @entity287 , it was him whom @entity5 called upon to take the reigns , and so it is not a position alien to the 48 - year - old			2
' it is not a nice position to be in again , i must admit , ' @entity68 told @entity295			0
' it was a surprise this morning			0
' we have all been disappointed by yesterday 's result but the first - half performance was decent			2
we 're just not taking our chances at the moment , so we 've come into work this morning and i get the phone call from the chairman			0
' it has been a shock for us all , but we have got to try and be professional and try and concentrate on a massive game tomorrow [ sunday ]			0
' the @entity5 face a tough trip to @entity308 , where they take on relegation rivals @entity84 in what would have been a return to his old club for @entity13			1
' @entity13 came in this morning and we had a quick chat , ' @entity68 continued			2
' he cleared his desk and his stuff			0
' it is always a sad time and it is very difficult for all of us , the staff , because he kept us here and we were part of his backroom staff			0
' we 're all disappointed but we have got to move on very quickly with this big game			0
