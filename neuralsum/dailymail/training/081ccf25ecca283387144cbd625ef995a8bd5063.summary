by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 15:13 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 1 march 2013 the commons expenses watchdog last night rebuked a @entity4 mp for writing ' abusive and offensive ' messages to its staff			1
@entity9 @entity8 was accused of adding notes to claims , telling one official they were ' talking sh * te ' , and condemning another as a ' pedantic @entity16 '			1
the criticism came just hours after mr @entity8 claimed he was the victim of ' bullying tactics ' by the @entity19 ( @entity20 )			1
ipsa chief executive @entity21 , right , said @entity22 mp @entity8 , left , called one expense watchdog official a ' pedantic @entity16 ' and wrote other ' offensive , abusive and condescending ' notes during @entity25 in the @entity26 today , mr @entity8 accused @entity20 chief executive @entity21 of using ' false innuendo and subterfuge ' to smear the name of politicians			1
' what do you think that subsequent to me raising these issues of @entity20 's senior management 's bullying tactics and threats to try and silence me regarding their spiralling costs ? ' the @entity22 mp asked @entity41			1
' do you think that their chief executive should show some backbone and meet with me as he refused to do so for over two and a half years , instead of attempting to smear members of @entity47 's names by false innuendo and subterfuge ? ' however , in a letter this evening , mr @entity21 denied the bullying allegations and insisted @entity20 was providing good value to the taxpayer			2
he went on : ' some of the notes written by you , and attached to your claims , were recently brought to my attention			2
' having reviewed those notes , i was taken aback by the content , which ranged from the abusive ( " you are a pedantic @entity16 , are n't you ? " ) through to the offensive ( " you 're talking sh * te " ) and on to the condescending ( " simples - or did n't you do geography at @entity61 and @entity62 ... " )			1
' we will do all that is reasonable to shield our team from such treatment			0
this policy and its application in your case have been expressly endorsed by the @entity74			0
' i had hoped it would be possible to address this behaviour without writing to you formally			2
in the light of your comments today , i write to ask that you conduct your dealings with us - orally or in writing - in civil terms			0
after mr @entity8 's question in the @entity86 , speaker @entity84 said @entity87 ' must really play the rules ' ' i do not ask you to like @entity20 or its policies			1
at the same time , @entity20 's team deserves to be treated in a courteous manner			0
i ask that , with immediate effect , you desist from correspondence which falls below this standard			0
' mr @entity21 went on to reject the mp 's claims that @entity20 was profligate , pointing out that its administration costs represent just 3.4 per cent of the Â£ 176milion public money it administers ; and that it is delivering savings of more than 5 per cent a year			0
' any discussion of our costs should , i suggest , be informed by a full understanding of our role and responsibilities , ' he said			0
' given your recent public reference to communication between yourself and @entity20 , i am publishing this letter			0
' last night @entity111 , @entity112 's candidate for @entity22 , said : ' it is absolutely and genuinely shocking that @entity22 's mp would use this kind of language in letters to any body or organisation			1
' i think voters in @entity22 will be appalled that they are being represented by someone who 's obviously abusive , ca n't control himself and has no idea what kind of behaviour is appropriate for a member of @entity47			1
this is embarrassing for @entity22 and mr @entity8 needs to apologise immediately			1
' mr @entity8 , who was first elected in 2010 , has attracted criticism for his offensive views on gay marriage			2
in a letter to a constituent , he said he felt it would lead to ' multi-partnership marriages and a reduction in the age of permitted marriage '			0
after he raised the issue in the @entity86 earlier , speaker @entity84 ruled that mr @entity8 's point was not a business question			2
mr @entity84 said he should have requested a statement or a debate , saying : ' members must really play by the rules and not invent them as they go along			0
' responding to the backbencher , mr @entity144 said : ' if it 's helpful to the @entity26 , i will of course be happy to meet you and as a member , mr speaker , of your committee on @entity20 , i will be glad to take forward any issues you have			0
' mr @entity8 was unavailable for comment last night .			2
