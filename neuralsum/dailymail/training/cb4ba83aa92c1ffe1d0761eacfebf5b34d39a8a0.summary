by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 08:17 est , 8 may 2013 most running races require a degree of speed , but even those who trailed in last in this fun - run found they took longer tying up their shoelaces than they did completing the course			1

pace yourselves : nearly 400 people entered the 55 - yard race around the tiny @entity23 in @entity12 , @entity13 a minature @entity25 , a couple of @entity27 - the miniature fun run resembled a marathon in everything but size @entity23 measures just 15ft by 30ft - barely the size of a traffic island - but is officially the @entity36 's smallest park the course involved a loop of what is officially the smallest park in @entity36 : the diminutive @entity23 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
everyone in the field , ranging in age from three months to 93 , successfully completed the triangular course , and they managed to raise more than £ 750 for local charities as they did so			0
the 150 - year - old park sits at the centre of a road intersection , and despite its size , boasts a wrought - iron perimeter fence , three trees and a memorial bench			2
