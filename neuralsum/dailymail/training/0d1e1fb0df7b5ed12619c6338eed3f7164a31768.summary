@entity1 ' girlfriend @entity0 was standing in a toilet cubicle facing the closed door when she was hit in the right hip by the first of four bullets fired by the double - amputee athlete , a police ballistics expert said on wednesday			1
captain @entity8 told @entity10 's @entity9 that ms @entity0 then fell back on to a magazine holder by the toilet before she was hit by a further two bullets fired by @entity1 through the wood door			1
one bullet fired from the 9mm pistol struck her in the right arm and while another penetrated her skull as she crossed her arms over her head to protect herself , captain @entity8 said			1
not listening : @entity1 appeared to place his thumbs in his ears as ballistic evidence about his girlfriend @entity0 's gunshot wounds are described to the court distressed : @entity1 wipes his eyes as ballistics expert captain @entity8 tell his murder trial how @entity0 was shot in the hip , arm and head alone : @entity1 sits in the dock on the 13th day of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend @entity0 at the @entity39 in @entity10 as @entity8 threw his hands up to cover his head in court and replicate the ' defensive position ' he said @entity0 took as the last shots were fired , @entity1 put his fingers in his ears in an apparent attempt to block out the testimony			1
june @entity0 , @entity48 's mother , also was in the courtroom and occasionally glanced at photos of the bloody scene of her daughter 's shooting before looking away			2
mr @entity8 also testified that he believed the second bullet fired missed ms @entity0 and ricocheted off a wall inside the cubicle and broke into fragments , which caused bruising on her back			1
mr @entity8 concluded , through his analysis of the shooting scene and wounds on ms @entity0 's body from post-mortem photos , that one bullet went through ms @entity0 's left hand before penetrating her skull as she held it over her head			1
the policeman said he could not determine the order of the last two shots			2
@entity1 , 27 , is charged with premeditated murder over ms @entity0 's death on february 14 last year and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted			1
he says he shot ms @entity0 , 29 , by mistake through a locked door in his bathroom because he thought she was a dangerous night - time intruder in his home			1
@entity1 says ms @entity0 went to use the toilet during the night without him knowing , but prosecutors maintain he killed her after a loud argument that caused her to possibly flee and hide in the toilet area			2
mr @entity8 said the bullet that struck ms @entity0 's skull broke into two fragments , one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her			1
the first shot into the right hip broke ms @entity0 's hip bone , mr @entity8 said			1
' i 'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted , she dropped immediately , ' mr @entity8 said			0
he said ms @entity0 then slumped into a ' seated or semi-seated position ' on top of a magazine rack near the toilet , where she was hit another two times			2
back in court : june @entity0 , mother of @entity0 , left , sits next to @entity104 spokesperson @entity103 , right , as details of her daughter 's death are described to the court questioning : state prosecutor @entity109 questions ballistics experts captain @entity8 over how ms @entity0 was killed ' she ended up with her head on top of the toilet seat , and the lower part of her body on the rack ' , mr @entity8 said			1
@entity1 fired from a distance of at least 60 centimetres ( 24in ) and no further than a wall behind him , about three metres ( 10ft ) away , mr @entity8 said			0
he also described the impact of the type of bullets in @entity1 ' gun , which were designed to cause maximum damage , he said			0
' it hits the target , it opens up , it creates six talons , and these talons are sharp , ' mr @entity8 said			0
' it cuts through the organs of a human being			0
' he noted the @entity134 brand of ammunition was often used for self - defence because while it caused significant damage to a human target , it was less likely to penetrate the first target and hit other people			0
mr @entity8 also said he conducted shooting tests to try to pinpoint the location from which the bullets were fired by @entity1 in the bathroom , based on where the cartridge cases were found			2
however , in his tests , he said , the cases fell at different angles			0
he also noted that the cartridge cases at the scene of ms @entity0 's shooting could have been ' moved or kicked around ' during the investigation			1
together : @entity0 pictured with @entity1			0
the prosecution allege he intentionally killed her after an argument scene : @entity1 shot @entity157 through the bathroom door at his home ( above ) in @entity10 in the early hours of @entity160 last year he said @entity1 was probably on his stumps when he fired , supporting the athlete 's statement that he was not wearing his prosthetic limbs when he opened fire			0
mr @entity109 also asked mr @entity8 to comment on a 2012 incident in which @entity1 allegedly fired his gun out of the sunroof of a moving car			0
the athlete faces a firearms charge in that case , as well as two other firearms charges			0
mr @entity8 said firing a shot in such circumstances was dangerous			2
the bullet leaves the barrel at around 280 metres ( 900 feet ) a second , and will travel upward , then stop and fall to the ground under the force of gravity and wind deflection , he said			0
' the bullet can still kill a person , ' mr @entity8 said			2
the trial has been adjourned until monday			0

captain @entity8 told how first bullet hit ms @entity0 's hip
shot caused her to fall backwards where she was hit by two more bullets

the policeman said he could not determine the order of the last two shots
