the @entity63 and @entity100 are likely to get the best weekend weather			0
makes even grim sites look pretty : a sultry start to the day in @entity104 , @entity105 , as the sun rises behind these brickyard chimneys and wind turbines having a lovely time by the river : members of the public enjoy the evening sunshine on the banks of the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 feeling bright and cheery : @entity115 , 38 , and @entity116 , 36 , enjoy the weather among daffodils at @entity119 in @entity120 londoners @entity121 and @entity123 continue to enjoy the sunshine and daffodils in @entity126 yesterday morning no leaves , but a bit of sun : a @entity131 train arriving at @entity133 station train drivers are being forced to slow down over fears the recent sunshine could cause tracks to overheat			0

' still , those who were not commuting or trapped in an office were finding reasons to get outside - such as @entity121 and @entity123 , both 23 years old from @entity172 , @entity41 , who enjoyed the heat in @entity175 yesterday afternoon			0
but make the most of it while you can - for while many have been soaking up the sun on beaches and parks around the country , as usual the clouds will roll in just in time for the weekend to provide us with a more traditional start to april .			2

only 1938 and 1957 have seen *higher* march averages as temperature set to hit @entity190 today
also on course to be the fifth driest march since records began
but we are *paying* price with drought as only 38 per cent of usual rain fell during the month
clouds expected to roll over @entity15 tomorrow as forecasters warn : ‘ @entity201 ’s not over yet ’
experts predict snow in @entity54 and could it fall as far south as @entity205 by *tuesday*
