secret intelligence suggested he had attended a terrorist training camp in @entity18 before he was recruited to the force			1
now the father of four , who admits travelling to @entity18 but vehemently denies meeting terrorists , is claiming a five - figure sum for alleged discrimination			1
but he has been unable to see the evidence against him because police and @entity8 do not want to reveal their sensitive sources			1
it is possible he was identified by an @entity10 supergrass who joined militants at camps on the lawless border between @entity18 and @entity33			1
the case raises serious questions about how he became a policeman and was able to work for three years and comes five years after the @entity38 first revealed that up to eight police officers and civilian staff had suspected links to extremist groups including @entity10			1
their names featured on a secret list of alleged radicals said to be working in the @entity4 and other forces			1
the dossier was drawn up with the help of @entity8 amid fears that individuals linked to @entity53 extremism are taking advantage of police attempts to increase the proportion of ethnic staff			1
mr @entity2 , who was born in @entity58 and became a @entity60 citizen aged nine , joined the @entity4 in 2003			2
the claims came to light three years later as @entity8 and counter-terrorism detectives undertook a massive review of security following the july 2005 terrorist attacks			2
mr @entity2 was questioned three times about his movements before his counter-terrorism clearance was suspended and he was put on restricted duties			2
the next year a hearing chaired by deputy assistant commissioner @entity71 , the then head of counter-terrorism , concluded he should be sacked , and he resigned a short time later			1

@entity95 , the @entity96 suicide bomber , is said to have visited one in the months before the july 7 attacks in 2005			0
mr @entity2 , who lives in @entity99 , declined to discuss the case			0
his solicitor @entity101 said her client denies the allegations against him and has been left in a ‘ ludicrous and inequitable ’ situation by the secrecy around his case			0

’ @entity112 , a @entity114 mp and expert on counter-terrorism , said he was astonished that mr @entity2 entered police ranks in the first place			0
