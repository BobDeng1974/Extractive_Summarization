for a club defined by its offensive flair and imagination , @entity1 ’s @entity0 look to have ran out of ideas in the final third			1
they had to rely on defensive midfielder @entity8 to rescue a stoppage - time point at @entity10 on sunday after another lethargic attacking display			1
for the numbers just do not add up ; age , transfer fee , salary and goals			0
it will cost @entity0 £ 50million to sign a four - goal 28 - year - old on wages north of £ 150,000 a week			1
that makes about as much sense as some of @entity43 ’s team selections and tactics			0
@entity20 has failed to impress in attack for @entity0 since his loan move from @entity47 @entity20 ( centre ) wasted a glorious chance to score for @entity0 against @entity10 when he shot wide on sunday the @entity51 international ( centre ) watches on as hit shot goes wide of the post instead of towards goal goals aside , even , @entity20 ’s overall contribution has been disappointing and he is averaging just one shot per game			1
where is that devastating striker who smashed a hat - trick past @entity62 in the colours of @entity64 in the @entity65 of 2012 ? he ’s certainly not at @entity66			2
for injury has undoubtedly diminished his powers			0
@entity20 seems at odds with himself , unable to impact in the manner he once could			1
gone is the swagger which made him the most coveted striker in @entity74			0
@entity20 's heat map in @entity0 's 1 - 1 draw away at @entity10 in the @entity22 on sunday the 28 - year - old 's heat map was n't much better in @entity0 's 3 - 1 win at home to @entity80 on january 31 there is a disconnect with team - mates , too , a failure to strike any sort of understanding with those around him			1
with 15 league appearances he can not blame a lack of opportunity , either			0
the only saving grace for @entity0 is the ‘ try before you buy ’ nature of his loan deal from @entity47			2
at this rate , they ’ve had a try , and they wo n’t be buying			0
@entity0 boss @entity1 consoles his forward at full - time as @entity0 salvage a point on sunday @entity19 ( 22 apps , nine goals , two assists ) look at a season - by - season record of @entity109 ’s time in @entity110			1
his career very evidently peaks in 2012 , the year which straddles 30 @entity22 goals for @entity115 and 26 for @entity0 , the latter of which won sir @entity118 a farewell title			1
those two years apart , his best returns read ; 18 , 12 , 11 , 11 , 9			0
the point is this : @entity109 is by no means a guaranteed source of goals , primarily because his fitness record has n’t allowed him to be			0
on his day , of course , he was the best			0
but therein lies the problem , his best days are behind him			0
even at the relatively young age of 31 , @entity109 is a fading force			0
@entity20 partnered @entity19 ( centre ) in attack but the duo failed to work effectively in tandem against @entity10 on sunday , @entity109 ( left ) failed to offer much in attack for @entity0 most of @entity109 's work came from the right hand side against @entity10 on sunday despite scoring at home to @entity80 , the @entity138 's heat map shows he had little involvement in play perhaps his team - mates have not aided his cause this season or last , but @entity109 has not bailed them out of trouble , either			1
he has one goal – the opener in a comfortable 3 - 1 home victory over @entity80 – in his last seven matches			1
the ‘ partnership ’ with @entity20 barely merits such description and the pair were again out of sync at @entity153			2
even under mentor and compatriot @entity43 , @entity109 ’s body language betrays what appears to be frustration – be that with himself or the system			0
@entity109 ( right ) has scored nine goals this term - with his last strike coming at home to @entity80 in january @entity109 ( right ) scored 26 league goals in his debut @entity0 campaign as they won the 2012 - 13 title @entity18 ( 20 apps , eight goals , four assists ) the problem for @entity18 , it seems , is that @entity43 has made him something of a project , using the re-positioning of the captain to prove his skill as master manager			1
@entity18 , of course , has spoken positively of his new midfield berth , but what else would he say ? @entity14 ’s @entity181 was not happy with the deployment of @entity18 during the draw at @entity10			1
@entity18 ( centre ) was used out of position again for @entity0 as they drew 1 - 1 at @entity10 @entity18 ( left ) was played on right of a narrow diamond midfield formation - instead of his natural role up front @entity18 ( right ) cut a frustrated figure at times during the match and was booked for dissent on sunday ‘ i was watching @entity18 today and the position he ’s in is not right , ’ @entity181 said			1
‘ @entity18 has got to get back up front , that ’s his best position , or , in this system , you ’d want him behind the front two			2
’ the numbers support @entity181 ’s concern			2
from 11 midfield outings he has scored just three times and is now without a goal in his last eight matches			0
in attack , his record reads far more favourably – five goals from nine games			0
@entity18 's heat map against @entity10 shows the 29 - year - old was largely deployed on the right in january 's win against @entity80 , @entity18 was highly effective in midfield but did n't charge forward in attack @entity18 's heat map in a 2 - 0 win at @entity217 last month also shows his little productiveness in the opposition box given @entity18 ’s nature and thirst for goals and glory , it wo n’t be long before frustration kicks in , and that in turn will unsettle the team			1
if @entity18 is @entity0 ’s best striker – and the numbers would suggest he is – then that is where he should play			1
@entity43 ’s persistence with his midfield experiment is counter-productive , to the team and the individual			0
@entity18 ( centre ) scored on the opening day against @entity238 - where he was played in attack by @entity43 @entity241 ( 11 apps , one goal , no assists ) talent clearly resides within the 19 - year - old and his involvement , in some sense , must be applauded			1
but is it too soon ? should he not be on loan in the championship - scoring goals and chasing promotion in much the same manner as @entity62 ’s @entity255 at @entity256			0
@entity241 ( centre ) is highly - rated by @entity43 but has been used as a substitute mainly this season @entity241 ( second right ) scored in his last game as @entity0 beat @entity261 3 - 0 in a @entity263 fourth round replay while he is bright and purposeful and undoubtedly gaining invaluable experience with every minute , a return of one league goal has done little to convince he is ready for the senior stage at @entity0			1
what he does inject , however , is an energy all too absent when @entity20 and @entity109 are paired			2
but does that not say more about @entity0 ’s offensive struggles that a rookie frontman is at times a better bet than the those senior stars ? @entity241 could well mature into @entity0 ’s next no9 and there is a raw enthusiasm about him which has its part to play amid their current toil			2
but to rely on the teenager would be asking too much			0
rather , his comrades need to step up			0
overall this campaign @entity241 has scored twice in 15 appearances in all competitions for @entity0			2

@entity0 drew 1 - 1 at @entity10 in the @entity22
@entity0 loanee @entity20 failed to live up to his £ 50million price tag
@entity18 is being wasted in midfield , *believes* @entity181
