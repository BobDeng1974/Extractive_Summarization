@entity1 and @entity2 players were both visibly shaken after the visitors ' captain @entity3 was hit on the helmet by the very first ball he faced from @entity1 paceman @entity7 in the first test at the @entity9			1
@entity7 reacted immediately to check on the @entity2 skipper 's welfare , as did several @entity1 players including captain @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
but @entity3 was thankfully not hurt by the 90mph bouncer and later went on to score a century on day three			1
the test match has been dedicated to late batsman @entity42 , @entity21 's 13th man , who died two weeks ago today after being struck in the neck by a bouncer			1
@entity3 's impressive 184 - ball innings of 115 on day three propelled the tourists to 369 for five at stumps after @entity21 declared on 517 for seven before the start of play			1
with the sun shining once more after wednesday 's interruptions , @entity21 declared their innings before the start of play			0
in the third over of the day , @entity54 , on one , survived a dropped chance when he got an inside edge off @entity7 , although it was a tough one as @entity14 dived for the ball only to see it slip through his grasp			2
@entity54 stuck around to help @entity18 score at a decent rate , but was nevertheless the first man out for 25 , another inside edge off @entity63 needing no further assistance this time as it went straight on to his stumps			0
@entity66 had made a tentative start at the other end , but after taking eight off a loose over from @entity69 , he began to open up , and he ended the 20th over with a six and a four off consecutive balls from @entity72			0
he would hit @entity73 for six again but soon after reaching his half - century he fell victim to @entity7 , playing at a delivery which swung away from him and helping it into the gloves of @entity14 to go for 53			2
the @entity2 captain ducked into a short ball from @entity7			2
@entity3 was visibly shaken up but not hurt @entity3 is struck			1
but the @entity2 skipper bounced back very quickly , two balls later he played a strong a straight drive down the ground			0
the first ball he faced hit the @entity2 captain on the front of the helmet			2
visibly concerned @entity1 players rushed to check if @entity3 was okay that brought @entity3 to the middle and before he could set about a fine afternoon 's work there was the tense moment of @entity7 's delivery hitting his helmet as he ducked late			1
once @entity3 was given chance to settle , he and @entity95 got to work before @entity73 broke their third - wicket stand with a good delivery which caused @entity95 to hesitate before a tentative prod merely helped it through on to the stumps			0
@entity73 continued to put @entity18 under pressure , in particular asking lots of questions of the new man in @entity107 , who was subject to one big shout for lbw - replays showed an inside edge - and then offered a half - chance to short leg , with the ball just falling short			2
from the first ball after tea , @entity3 brought up his first test fifty in 11 innings , a great way to show how he is handling the extra responsibility of captaining the side for the first time			2
at the other end , @entity107 was nearing a half - century of his own , but still offering chances			0
a big pull shot from a @entity69 bouncer went high but @entity73 , racing in from the boundary , could not stretch for the catch and instead it ran for four			0
@entity16 and @entity15 join @entity7 to check on @entity3 after he was struck on the helmet words of encouragement from the @entity1 skipper @entity13 for paceman @entity7 , who was noticeably shaken up after his delivery struck the @entity2 captain on the helme @entity107 would make it past 50 , but with the new ball looming , @entity72 stepped up his attack			1
@entity21 claimed the catch when @entity16 twisted acrobatically at short leg , but the ball had come off the pad			0
but from the next delivery , @entity107 gloved it to the slips where @entity143 hung on to remove him for 62			0
with @entity144 in at the other end , @entity3 brought up his century in style by punishing @entity149 's poor delivery to claim his 12th and final four of the day over the mid-wicket boundary			1
they kept @entity18 ticking over before @entity7 made the key breakthrough for the hosts in the 95th over , taking @entity3 's wicket with a bouncer that the @entity18 captain could only send into the palms of @entity63 at deep fine leg			1
stumps came two overs later with @entity144 , unbeaten on 33 , and @entity161 , one not out , at the crease with @entity18 trailing by 148 runs			0
