@entity0 was sentenced to life for the murders of @entity3 , his wife @entity4 and their 28 - year - old son @entity5 locking up @entity9 ’s most evil criminals until they die does not breach their human rights , @entity7 judges ruled yesterday			1
in a major victory for justice secretary @entity13 , @entity11 backed ‘ whole life ’ prison sentences for horrific murders and other heinous crimes			2
the @entity18 dismissed an appeal by a notorious triple killer against his ‘ life means life ’ tariff			1
@entity0 , 74 , stabbed a bride ’s parents and brother to death on her wedding night and repeatedly raped a teenage house guest in a frenzied attack in october 1983			1
the ruling means notorious prisoners , including @entity33 murderer @entity31 and @entity34 , the paedophile killer of five - year - old @entity34 , can be kept behind bars indefinitely			1
after the decision , mr @entity13 said : ‘ those who commit the most heinous crimes deserve to spend the rest of their lives in prison			0
‘ that is what the public want , and it is right that judges will continue to be able to hand down whole life orders to the very worst offenders			2
’ the ruling was a significant retreat for the @entity7 court ’s grand chamber , which in july 2013 ruled that whole life terms were ‘ inhuman and degrading ’ and should be reviewed after 25 years			1
it had claimed the lack of a proper review and hence the lack of hope , however remote , of eventual release was a major breach of prisoners ’ human rights			1
but @entity9 ’s @entity65 said last february that the @entity7 court was wrong and ruled killers could potentially be released at the discretion of the justice secretary if ‘ exceptional grounds ’ existed , for example if they were terminally ill. yesterday , the @entity11 - based court agreed and threw out @entity0 ’s appeal – ruling that his whole - life sentence did not violate the @entity75			1
it said @entity9 had ‘ specifically addressed ’ the issue and that the legal situation was ‘ in line with human rights laws ’			1
double police killer @entity81 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) , who murdered five - year - old @entity34 , are serving life sentences the ruling is a further sign that the @entity7 courts are stepping back from interfering in @entity9 laws			1
it is also an important boost for the @entity89 in the run - up to may ’s general election			0
stinging criticism by mps and ministers of meddling by @entity11 appeared to have had some influence on the latest ruling , which may stem a drift of voters to @entity100			2
@entity7 judges who strayed beyond their original brief were cited by the @entity103 in proposals published last year to claw back sovereignty and scrap the @entity106 in favour of a @entity9 bill of rights			2
if the government had lost the latest case it could have opened the way for parole hearings by @entity115 , the @entity115 ( left ) and @entity31 , the @entity116 ( right ) @entity117 , a @entity89 mp campaigning for reform of human rights legislation , said : ‘ it ’s welcome that this government stood firm and @entity11 has performed a u-turn			1
‘ but it also highlights the intensely political instincts of a court that meddles when it thinks it can get away with it			0
that ’s why we need conservative reforms of our relationship with @entity11 , to safeguard the democratic right of our @entity132 to have the last word on @entity9 justice			0
’ last week @entity11 judges agreed it was lawful to extradite to the @entity137 a terror suspect accused of being @entity140 ’s trusted sidekick			0
and last august they saved @entity9 taxpayers millions by saying prisoners barred from voting should not get compensation			0
frenzied attack : @entity0 @entity0 carried out the bloody slaughter of @entity3 ’s family at their home in october 1983			2
the 59 - year - old solicitor , his wife @entity4 , 55 , and son @entity5 , 28 , were all murdered on the day they spent celebrating the wedding of daughter @entity155			0
armed with an eight - inch bowie knife , @entity157 – nicknamed ‘ @entity158 ’ – broke into the wealthy family ’s home in @entity161 to carry out the killings			0
he then grabbed hold of an 18 - year - old woman who was staying at the house , forced her to walk through a pool of blood , took her to a marquee in the grounds and raped her			0
@entity0 was captured after weeks on the run and convicted thanks to the rape victim ’s testimony and a wealth of forensic evidence , including his palm print on a bottle of wedding champagne			0
the judge in his 1984 trial at @entity181 said he should serve 18 years but home secretary @entity182 later ruled he should face a whole life tariff			0
before the latest ruling ministers had been forced to consider scrapping ‘ life means life ’ sentences completely			1
instead of being told they must die in prison , it was thought offenders could be given an @entity137 - style jail sentence of up to 100 years that would have been subject to review			0
fifty - five inmates in @entity195 and @entity196 are serving whole life tariffs , including @entity198 , @entity199 and one - eyed police killer @entity81			1
the longest serving whole life prisoner is @entity31 , who committed the @entity31 between 1963 and 1965			2

@entity205 killer @entity0 loses **challenge** against ' life means life ' term
@entity0 jailed in 1984 for stabbing a mother , father and son to death
he was first to **challenge** sentence after court ruling whole - life tariffs illegal
judges said life sentences with no chance of release violated human rights
today judges said as long as life sentences can be ' reviewed ' they are okay
it means killers like @entity34 and @entity31 can never be released
ministers *feared* a wave of appeals from some of the most notorious killers
