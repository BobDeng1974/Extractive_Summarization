a military charity launched a worldwide hunt today to track down the owner of a damaged pocket watch which is believed to have saved the life of an @entity6 servicewoman in @entity7 - by stopping a bullet			1
the solid silver timepiece , which was made in the @entity11 age , was discovered in a box of donated items left anonymously at a forces charity shop			1
a perfect bullet - shaped crater is evident in the protective flip cover of the watch which also damaged the 11 ’ clock marking on the clock face			1
the ' bullet - damaged ' wwii solid silver timepiece , which was made in the @entity11 age , was discovered in a box of donated items left anonymously at a forces charity shop in @entity24 , @entity25 a perfect bullet - shaped crater is evident in the protective flip cover of the watch , which belonged to @entity6 servicewoman @entity29 the case of the watch is inscribed with the name ' @entity29 ' alongside the military number 2055250			1
the final words on the case read : ' farnboro [ sic ] hants			1
' official military records reveal @entity29 was a woman who served in the auxiliary core of the @entity6 which was responsible for delivering newly built planes to military bases across @entity43 in 1941			1
a source at the @entity45 said no further information regarding the identity of the servicewoman could be provided without a relevant birth or death certificate			1
it is believed @entity29 came under enemy fire while inside the plane			1

above , servicewoman @entity57 collects a spitfire in @entity59 , @entity60 , in 1945 they were sleek , beautifully shaped , and earned something of a racy reputation			1
and that was just the spitfires they flew			1
but even away from the cockpit , the plucky young gals of the @entity7 @entity68 turned plenty of heads as well			2
in their hastily adapted uniforms ( one even had her jacket tailored in @entity75 ) they became the darlings of the air – and the unsung heroines of the @entity79			2
this was the forgotten army of women who broke through male - dominated barriers to pilot the aircraft – and to deliver them for service in the front line			2
it was a job that perfectly suited the @entity88 , as they became known , and not just because they boosted the war effort with such pluckiness and enthusiasm			2
their petite frames fitted the cramped interior of the @entity97 so snugly it was , as one put it , ‘ like wearing a well - fitting dress ’			2
only 164 women were allowed into the @entity68			2
back then , they had to show plenty of determination to convince military bosses that women were up to the task			1
but once accepted , they said , they were treated no differently from the men			2
the @entity68 delivered more than 308,000 aircraft from factories to airfields , also returning damaged aircraft for repair			1
sometimes the @entity88 would be given only 30 minutes with a handbook before taking off in an unfamiliar plane			2
losses were considerable , with one in six becoming a casualty at one stage			2
the role of the ‘ @entity120 ’ was largely overlooked until 2008 , when the then prime minister @entity121 was persuaded to honour them with a commemorative badge			0
@entity124 and his government , however , never underestimated their contribution			0
lord @entity127 , then his aircraft production minister , declared : ‘ they were soldiers fighting in the struggle just as completely as if engaged on the battlefront			0
’ military experts have identified the bullet which caused the dent as a 30mm calibre round - ammunition used in the @entity136 auto - cannon which was mounted on @entity138 aircraft fighter planes			1
it is believed the watch saved the life of whoever was wearing it after the round ricocheted off the watch - which was traditionally worn in the breast pocket of service personnel			0
the watch was found dumped in the bottom of a box which was donated to the @entity152 charity , in @entity24 , @entity25 , on saturday , march 3			0
founder and chief executive of the charity , @entity153 said : ' it is most remarkable - it has probably saved someone ’s life			0
' there ’s a strong possibility that it has come from a mid-air fight rather than being fired ground - to - air			0
' it ’s hit the watch straight on and the case has taken the full impact - it would only have done this if the person had been on the ground or if it had been air to air			0
' i ’ve never had anything like it in 28 years in the second - hand trade , not at auction or in a shop window			0
' after taking advice from two military experts including a former @entity183 soldier , it looks like the bullet has hit the watch and shattered the enamel , the copper case and the workings			1
' they both agreed that it had stopped something with quite a high velocity			0
' when the actual story comes out , i think it will be quite a romantic one , especially as women in the auxiliary core did fly planes around the country to deliver them once they were built			1
' it could have saved the life of someone who was delivering one of the planes			1
' it is also possible the watch was given to @entity29 ’s squaddie sweetheart whose life could have been saved during a bloody frontline battle			1
mr @entity153 , 45 , added : ' it could have belonged to someone ’s sweetheart - the person may have moved on since but i ’m sure the memory is still very strong			0
' it would be nice to get it back to the family of the person that it saved			0
' i ’ve read about rare finds like this in the paper but never actually discovered one myself			0
' it ’s the sort of thing you see in a film , not in a box of bric - a - brac			0
' the charity is now desperately trying to track down either the owner of the watch or the person who donated it			0
mr @entity153 said : ' it is n’t the sort of thing we would look to sell , so if the owner does n’t come forward we will probably have it on display in the shop or on the counter			0
' the story should really still be alive in someone ’s heart - it ’s not the sort of thing you would hear about and forget in a hurry			0
' do you know the full identity of the watch owner ? if so , please contact us at editorial@dailymailonline.co.uk it is believed the watch saved the life of whoever was wearing it after the round ricocheted off the watch - which was traditionally worn in the breast pocket of service personnel			0
