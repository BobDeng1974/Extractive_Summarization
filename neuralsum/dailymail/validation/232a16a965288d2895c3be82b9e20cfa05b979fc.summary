the lavishly gifted @entity3 threequarter has already overcome more hurdles than many encounter in a lifetime			1
stand his ground with troubled foster children ? naturally			0
ignore advice from coaches that he was too small for rugby as a teenager ? absolutely			0
battle type 1 diabetes to forge a burgeoning professional rugby career ? no @entity16 @entity17 on his first @entity19 appearance ? by a @entity20 included as the wild card in @entity24 's @entity23 squad ? just maybe			1
@entity3 playmaker @entity0 ( right ) is being touted as a potential wildcard for @entity27 's @entity23 squad the 22 - year - old has been in superb form for @entity3 this season and could slot in nicely in the @entity27 set - up for his many talents , @entity0 , 22 , named @entity35 player of the month for march , remains humble , grounded and reluctant to talk up his @entity23 prospects			1
but his consistently high - quality displays in the @entity3 midfield are making his case hard to ignore			1
the only player name - checked by @entity24 as a possible @entity23 bolter after impressing on attachment to the squad during the @entity46 , the lithe left - footer from @entity41 has been told he will definitely feature in @entity27 's @entity48 camp where he can stake a claim for inclusion			1
many believe he could yet prove @entity27 's missing midfield link as a physically robust , footballing 12 of enormous potential			1
' it 's nice to have that knowledge that i 'll be there and have a chance to stake my claim , ' he said			2
' everyone likes to feel they 're ready for that next step			0
i feel i 'm capable but it 's not up to me			2
it does n't get any bigger than a home @entity23 and of course i 'd love to be involved			1
who would n't ? but i realise i 'm still some way down the pecking order and have plenty to do			0
' @entity0 's humility is evident as we sit and talk in @entity74 's main stand enjoying the milky @entity76 spring sunshine			1
on the field , he has more of a strut ; confident in his skills and sure of his intent			0
a first international cap is a matter of when , not if			0
but just like the @entity3 club he joined as a teenager , @entity0 refuses to get carried away by success			1
he is wise beyond his years , having lived with diabetes since a chance diagnosis at the age of 18			2
standing up for his younger brothers when his parents took on foster children also opened his eyes to a world beyond the rugby field			0
' @entity95 used to own a hairdressing salon but sold it when she had kids and became a respite foster carer instead , ' he said			0
' it puts things in perspective seeing kids my age who 'd had such difficult upbringings or had been taken away from their parents because they were n't fit to look after them			0
' when they started kicking off you 'd have to stop them but i 'd always try to take a minute to sit back and think , ' bloody hell , they 've had it tough ' and think about why they 'd be reacting in that way			0
it was a pretty good life experience			0
' @entity0 has overcome many challenges in his career , including diagnosis with type 1 diabetes aged 18 a less welcome experience has been the daily injections of insulin and regular blood tests required to check his blood sugar is not at dangerous levels			1
typically , @entity0 considers his glass half full , not half empty			2
' getting the diagnosis at 18 was pretty tough to take , ' he said			0
' my dad had it as well so i knew how it would affect my life and how organised i was going to have to be			0
still , while the other lads get their supplements and beetroot shakes before a match i get a nice big cup of jelly babies , so it 's not all bad			2
' thriving under the tutelage of director of rugby @entity144 at the upwardly mobile @entity35 club , @entity0 is making a name for himself by stepping up to every challenge put in front of him			1
he first made the headlines as a 20 - year - old in 2012 with an outrageously composed display against @entity17 and his @entity155 team - mates after being called on as a first - half replacement for @entity157			1
five years earlier , he would have been excused for giving up the game			0
' i went for a county under 15s trial and was told i was too small , ' he said			0
' i was devastated but it made me work harder the following year			2
hitting my growth spurt probably helped too			0
' now standing 6ft 2in and weighing in excess of 14st , @entity0 has proved his defensive mettle countless times this season , most notably against @entity167 early in the season when he proved a match for his hulking opposite man @entity170 on a string of occasions			1
similar in style to @entity175 maestro @entity174 , @entity0 has taken heart from the performances of fellow ' lightweights ' @entity178 and @entity180 during @entity27 's @entity46 campaign			1
' i obviously understand and respect that winning collisions is a massive part of rugby but there still has to be space for players like @entity180 and @entity178 , ' he said			0
@entity0 kicks a penalty during the @entity35 match between @entity3 and @entity190 at @entity191 ' @entity178 is not the biggest of players but his footwork and the way he beats defenders is top class			1
it 's the same scenario as we had here with me and @entity199 in the centre			2
two different styles who can play to each other 's strengths and cover every base			2
it 's the beauty of having a ball player and a physical , trucking - up type centre			1
' comfortable at fly - half or centre and an outstanding left - footed goal - kicker , @entity0 would be a more than useful squad player			1
if he can make the cut , indications are he has the temperament for international rugby			0
' i 've always relished the challenge and found the bigger the occasion the more excited i get by it and the more i enjoy it , ' he added			0
so , what money @entity0 at @entity221 when @entity27 play @entity223 at @entity191 on september 18 ? it is still a long shot , but he has already made a habit of defying the odds			2
@entity0 offloads the ball while playing for @entity229 against @entity230 in january this year			1
