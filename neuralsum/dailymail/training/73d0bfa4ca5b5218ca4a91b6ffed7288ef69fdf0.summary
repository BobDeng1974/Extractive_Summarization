@entity0 was deemed surplus to requirements by @entity3 during the autumn but the @entity5 winger has not given up on his international ambitions			1
he started just one test in 2014 but put his hand up for a recall with a double in the 33 - 10 win over @entity12 on saturday , taking him to 19 tries in 22 @entity16 games			1
asked about his hopes of a @entity19 call - up , @entity0 ( right ) said : ‘ i do n’t expect anything			1
' i ’ve got to fight to get back in			0
hopefully @entity22 ( @entity23 ) will recognise my hunger to play for @entity3 is as strong as ever			2
’ @entity0 - seen celebrating a try for @entity5 on saturday - says he will fight for an @entity3 recall @entity29 hooker @entity28 will face a disciplinary panel after his red card in the 43 - 41 win over @entity33 in the @entity34			1
@entity28 was adjudged to have entered a ruck with his head , but the @entity37 held on for their first victory since @entity39 left			2
@entity40 , @entity39 ’s summer replacement , wants @entity42 , cousin of @entity43 , to join his coaching team			2
@entity29 hooker @entity28 ( middle ) looks bemused at the decision to send him off against @entity33 the great escape is still on for @entity49 ’s @entity48 after the @entity3 hopeful delivered a tackling masterclass in the 23 - 3 victory at @entity53 on saturday night			1
despite losing their first two @entity55 games , @entity48 could secure a home quarter - final if they beat @entity57 at home this saturday			1
wasps are hoping to rekindle their glory days of the last decade and @entity49 , who made 28 of his side ’s 199 tackles at @entity63 , wants to emulate the achievements of his predecessor , @entity65 , whose career was cut short by a neck injury			0
@entity49 produced a tackling masterclass for @entity48 against @entity53 on saturday ‘ one of my heroes in rugby is @entity65 , ’ said @entity49			1
‘ he would regularly put in 30 tackles a game			0
he taught me to tackle , so if i can get to that level i am pleased			0
‘ when i re-signed and came back from @entity77 ( in 2012 ) we nearly got relegated			0
my knees were gone , i think @entity80 ( @entity79 ) thought he had signed a donkey			0
there was lots of change			0
if we can keep the squad together and keep signing players , then i think we have more to give			2
’ a deal for @entity77 winger @entity88 is close to completion , while @entity90 understands that @entity92 international @entity91 is also on the club ’s radar .			0

@entity0 has *scored* 19 tries in 22 @entity16 games
despite that the @entity5 winger does *n't* believe he has much chance of getting a call - up to the @entity3 @entity19 squad
the *27* - year - old was deemed to requirements by @entity3 in the summer
elsewhere , @entity29 *'s* @entity28 will face a disciplinary panel after his red card against @entity33
@entity48 could yet secure a home quarter - final if they beat @entity57 at home on saturday , despite losing their first two @entity55 games
