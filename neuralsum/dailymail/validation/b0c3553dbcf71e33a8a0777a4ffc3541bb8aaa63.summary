the worry for @entity1 is that things could get worse before they get better			1
the cricket itself is bad enough			1
but we 're thinking of events off the field : if they were handed the keys to @entity12 headquarters , the @entity8 and the @entity9 would probably bicker less and command more gravitas than the current lot			2
one of the side - effects of @entity1 's horrible performance at the @entity17 was to bring forward the moment when our game would have to confront itself			1
while they were still in the tournament , there was always the promise of a horizon to cross , an itch to scratch , a wrong to right			2
the most alarming development of another improbable week was @entity29 's outburst in @entity30			1
it was no coincidence that the most heartfelt press conference of his career took place beyond the grasp of the @entity12 ( perhaps beginning the county season in the @entity37 does have something to recommend it after all )			2
@entity1 vice captain @entity39 looks dejected as he leaves the field after their @entity17 exit @entity1 's exit at the @entity17 was humiliating as they went out in @entity43 , @entity44 @entity1 coach @entity45 ( left ) at the @entity47 match between @entity1 and @entity48 but @entity29 was unhappy			1
more to the point , he has n't got his head round his sacking as one - day captain			1
neither fact reflects well on the @entity55 game			2
his @entity56 came not long after coach @entity45 had assured us that @entity29 had dealt with the disappointment of being axed only weeks before the @entity17			1
thoughts returned to the days before that axing , when @entity45 stressed his support for @entity29 's leadership ; once the leadership was over , @entity45 said it was ' the right thing to do '			1
something is clearly being lost in translation			2
and it had better be reinterpreted fast : @entity1 are about to embark on 17 tests in 10 months			1
it is a period that will define both captain and coach , assuming they emerge unscathed			1
yet @entity29 also needs to be frank with himself			1
the reason he should n't have been sacked so soon before a @entity17 was that he should have been sacked well in advance , and allowed to focus on what – until two years ago – he was good at : churning out @entity77 runs			2
instead , he has now been critical not just of the decision to sack him , but also – by implication – of @entity81 's leadership			2
@entity29 was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in @entity30 @entity29 trudges off the field in @entity30 after falling for five following just three in the first innings for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity88 : @ the_topspin team insiders believe his words came out the wrong way			1
but had they been uttered by @entity93 , they would have brought howls of ' insubordination '			1
and @entity93 , lapping up the limelight once more , has loved every minute			1
ever since @entity97 appeared to suggest there was a way back , he has taken every opportunity to stay in the headlines			2
this is his prerogative , and it has at least served to expose the @entity12 's continued mismanagement of the saga			2
to hear the national selector @entity106 dead - bat questions from the @entity108 last week was to wonder at the task awaiting the @entity12 's new head of communications , @entity112			2
meanwhile , confusion continues over what exactly @entity97 said to @entity93			1
reports vary : he 's offered an olive branch , no he has n't ; he 's assured @entity29 that @entity93 wo n't play for @entity1 again , no he has n't ; he 's told @entity118 there are no guarantees , no he … you get the picture			1
and all this , remember , before @entity97 has even replaced @entity124 as chairman			2
in some ways , @entity97 deserves our sympathy : he has inherited a mess which he presumably did n't envisage while he was operating under the radar as @entity124 's deputy			2
and his statement on @entity93 – play county cricket or there really is no hope – had the virtue of treating him like a member of civilised society			1
@entity93 will have nine @entity141 matches at the most to impress @entity1 's selectors he 's secured a released from @entity143 to stake his claim for an @entity1 return in the ashes but the latest bout of confused messages , simmering feuds and egotistical grandstanding are a reminder that @entity55 cricket should be careful when it next mocks , say , the @entity155 or the @entity156 for presiding over complete chaos			1
it 's over a year now since @entity93 was told to pack up his troubles in his old kit bag			1
yet , in the eyes of the public , the @entity12 are no closer to moving on			0
on the contrary : the crowd watching the sideshow is threatening to outnumber those who can still be bothered with the cricket			0
@entity93 has played the media game with his customary flair , befriending those he once disdained			1
but it 's up to the @entity12 to take charge			0
if they imagine they can win his silence while planning not to pick him – and that , by the way , is their plan – then @entity29 's meltdown may not be the last			1
there 's nothing like the pricking of officialdom 's bubble to soothe the soul			0
when the @entity186 posted what they thought was a congratulatory tweet to the @entity190 team on a ' memorable and inspiring ' @entity17 , they enthused : ' see what captain @ purdy34 had to say here … ' ' captain @ purdy34 ' , aka @entity195 , saved @entity88 users the bother of clicking on the @entity186 's link by responding directly with a tweet of his own : ‪ ' @ @entity186 so memorable and inspiring that you have decided to cut the next @entity17 to 10 teams			1
what is your vision for the game of cricket ? ' funnily enough , the many replies did not include one from the @entity186			0
@entity195 saved @entity88 users the bother of clicking on the @entity186 's link by responding directly it 's hardly unprecedented for politicians to thump a few tubs in an attempt to rally their constituents			0
so , as @entity48 fumed over the no - ball that was n't during their quarter - final defeat by @entity217 – fondly imagining that a semi-final place had been wrenched from their grasp – their head cricket honcho @entity213 cheerfully fumed : ' it seems the @entity186 has become the @entity221			0
' the joke was lost on the @entity186 , which was hardly surprising : @entity213 is their president			0
worse , he reportedly threatened to resign if the @entity186 – his @entity186 – did n't investigate the umpiring			0
in the circumstances , @entity186 chief executive @entity224 might have been lost for words			0
instead he managed a faintly splenetic : ' as an @entity186 president , he should have been more considerate in his criticism of @entity186 match officials , whose integrity can not be questioned			0
' needless to say , @entity213 later dismissed reports of his threat to quit as ' rumours '			0
@entity236 media … @entity237 ( @entity237 ) president @entity213 ( right ) pictured during a press conference scrap the quarters it 's not the @entity186 's fault that the @entity17 quarter - finals were mainly one - sided , memorable only for individual feats – @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246			0
but , as i wrote in the 2012 @entity249 , the tournament would benefit from losing the quarter - finals altogether			0
the quarters are a nice conceit : they ensure seven knockout matches rather than three , and create the illusion that there are eight teams who can actually lift the trophy			0
but their presence continues to make a turkey of the group stage , which stretches over a month and is grateful for whatever storylines are tossed its way			0
so here 's the plan : allow 12 teams to take part in 2019 ( not 10 , as per the @entity186 's plan ) , stage two groups of six ( all play all ) , and scrap the quarter - finals altogether			0
with only two teams progressing from each group , all the early matches would be meaningful , which would more than compensate for the loss of the quarters			0
and the @entity277 would get their chance without being accused of contributing to a meaningless first phase			0
the problem ? only 33 matches , compared with the 49 we have now			0
@entity283 would n't like it , even if many fans would accept the shortfall in return for the prolonged tension			0
and even one game a day would still allow the tournament to last a month			0
@entity186 , over to you .			0

@entity1 were *embarrassingly* knocked out of the @entity293
@entity29 *blasted* @entity1 for sacking him as captain
@entity93 has been lapping up the limelight , loving every minute
