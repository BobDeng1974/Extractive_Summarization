she might be a no - nonsense countrywoman but even the @entity1 could n't resist a grimace when handed a plasticised dog heart during a visit to a @entity6 vet			1
the heart , which did come from a real animal , had been preserved with chemicals and was being used as a teaching aid by professors at the @entity12			1
luckily for pet - loving @entity14 , the visit was n't all animal parts and surgery , with the @entity1 breaking into a smile after finding some living animals to pet			2
she immediately obliged , with the dog , who was at the hospital for a routine examination , looking beseechingly up at @entity14 while she patted him			0
another pet waiting in the consulting room was @entity37 , a fluffy feline whose less - than - impressed expression was enough to rival @entity40 's			1
owned by the @entity43 family , the cat spent the royal visit staring moodily at the table and refused to engage with either nurses or @entity28			0
@entity14 , who was elegant in a blue cashmere suit by couturier @entity48 , had more luck with a bearded dragon named @entity51 , which was happy to be petted by the @entity1			2
gruesome : the heart , which is a real one , is used as a teaching aid by professors at the veterinary hospital much better : @entity22 looked far happier when meeting @entity26 , a lurcher in for a check - up quick pat : @entity22 , a dog owner herself , gave the grizzled pet a pat and one for you too ! a bearded dragon named @entity51 also got a quick scratch from the @entity1 not amused : @entity37 the cat , perhaps disliking being at the vets , looked grumpy throughout cross : the pet remained unmoved by the royal visit , despite @entity14 's best efforts having toured the wards , @entity14 ventured into the teaching part of the hospital where she encountered a familiar face - a horse named @entity75 which had been through the same plasticisation process as the dog heart			1
' i do remember seeing him jump many years ago ! ' said the @entity1 of the horse , which was part of @entity83 's show jumping team at the @entity84			0
@entity75 , a 16.3hh golden bay gelding , took bronze during that event and went on to amass several more medals before dying in 1959			0
@entity14 's visit to the @entity90 came as part of her work with the @entity93 , of which she has been patron since 2005			0
hello there : @entity22 peered into one of the clinic cages for a better look at a sick iguana shy : rather than face the cameras , one ginger cat chose to hide behind its blanket instead model student : @entity103 showed the @entity28 a horse head she had made from cloth enjoying herself : @entity14 chatted to student @entity107 during a reception at the end of the visit the @entity93 is the @entity111 â€™s registered charity and it raises funds to support research into improving veterinary treatment and training budding medics			0
speaking after the visit , professor @entity117 , principal of the @entity111 , said : ' the generous donations to the @entity93 are invaluable in helping us to deliver the best possible care to our patients and world - leading veterinary education to our students			0
' we were delighted to welcome @entity14 to our teaching hospital in @entity127 so that she could see just how much of an impact these donations have on the work that we do			0
' meanwhile ... prince @entity131 survives a security scare in @entity133 unscathed : prince @entity131 had a security scare during a visit to the @entity133 but emerged unscathed moving on : as a result , he was able to carry on to the @entity137 to present some awards scheme : he was presenting @entity141 gold award winners with their certificates the @entity1 is n't the only royal who has been busy this week , with @entity131 spending the last two days in @entity133			1
@entity131 was there to present certificates to local students on behalf of the @entity148 scheme but also fell victim to a security alert			1
the scare came as the result of the presence of a mysterious package outside the @entity133 , which he was touring at the time			1
happily , police fears proved unfounded and @entity131 was able to continue on to his next engagement at the @entity137 .			2

the @entity1 toured the @entity12
looked *horrified* when handed a plasticised but real dog heart
enjoyed meeting the live pets , among them *dogmatix* the lurcher
less impressed was @entity37 the cat , who looked cross throughout
meanwhile , @entity131 had a security scare while visiting @entity133
@entity171 emerged none the worse and scare proved to be a false alarm
