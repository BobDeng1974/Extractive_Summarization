thousands of mobile phone users were left unable to use their phones following a blunder by the @entity5 's consumer advice programme watchdog			1
many who tuned in were disturbed by a security flaw which lets phone thieves swop sim cards to other handsets but continue to use the victim 's account to make calls			2
host @entity14 explained how criminals then run up bills costing thousands of pounds by making lengthy calls to premium lines which they have stakes in			2
the @entity5 had omitted a very important detail – you need the network provider 's default code to change the security sim code – as without it the mobile becomes automatically locked			1
viewers turned to @entity41 to vent their fury in a stream of tweets , criticising the @entity5 for giving erroneous advice , which it only corrected 15 hours later			0
callers to the key network provider @entity48 jammed its switchboard as they desperately tried to get their phones working again			0
@entity51 tweeted : ' i was trying to set up a sim pin and locked my sim – need a @entity55 code but ca n't call to get one as i do n't have a phone ! ' and @entity58 , from @entity59 , tweeted : ' i think the whole country is trying to get @entity55 codes right now			0
that was n't clear whatsoever in the programme			0
grr ! ' a @entity5 spokesperson said : ' @entity65 did not give out instructions on how to set up a pin for sim cards , nor did we give out any on - screen steps that viewers should follow			1
' whilst we did advise people to get a security pin to protect themselves against fraud , we told them to check their phone 's instructions before attempting to do so			0
' the @entity5 failed to advice users that they needed their network provider 's default code to change the security sim code - without which - the mobile phone is automatically locked , prompting outrage on @entity41			1

@entity14 told how thieves can run up bills on *stolen* mobile phones
watchdog gave instructions how users can protect their sim cards
the @entity5 failed to pass on a vital *information* on a network security code
as a result , thousands of users discovered that their mobiles were locked
outraged viewers took to @entity41 to *express* their anger over the blunder
