by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:45 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 06:47 est , 12 july 2013 head of the @entity4 @entity3 warned health spending could not be protected @entity8 funding could have to be cut after the election following @entity11 ’s move to rule out further tax rises , it was warned today			1
ring fence protection for the health service and pensions will come under ‘ additional pressure ’ after 2015 , the @entity4 said			1
the chancellor drew the battle lines for the 2015 campaign yesterday , insisting that he can get the deficit under control with spending cuts alone			1
under mr @entity11 ’s austerity plans , a further £ 23billion of savings must be found in 2016 and 2017			0
but questioned by mps on the @entity26 , he insisted : ‘ i ’m clear that tax increases are not required to achieve this			1
this can be achieved through spending reductions			0
’ mr @entity11 went further when he addressed a lunch of @entity33 journalists , saying that he is advocating a ‘ 100 per cent spending mix ’			0
however the @entity4 said that the decision would mean a further £ 6 billion being slashed from public spending - leaving budgets for many areas of @entity38 spending one - third lower than they were when the coalition came to power in 2010			2
@entity4 director @entity3 added that mr @entity11 ’s pledge would break his previous rule of thumb that 80 per cent of the deficit - reduction programme should be funded by cuts and 20 per cent by tax hikes			1
and he made clear that it would become increasingly difficult for the government to maintain the so - called ‘ ringfence ’ protecting areas like the @entity8 , schools , overseas aid and pensions from cuts			2
this week @entity54 warned the health service would face a £ 30billion black hole by 2021 without fundamental change to the way services are offered			0
mr @entity3 told @entity60 's today programme : ‘ one of the difficulties that governments are in at the moment is that if you ringfence health and pensions - and obviously you ca n't do anything about what you are spending on debt interest - that 's a very , very large chunk of spending that is just out of the picture			2
‘ therefore , everything else - if you are going to do it all through spending - has to be cut a lot			0
‘ if you are going to do it all through spending that does put additional pressure on the ringfence			0
’ shortfall : after the 2015 election big savings will have to be made , which could need taxes to rise by £ 6bilion to @entity4 said mr @entity3 cautioned that it would be unusual for mr @entity11 to forswear tax hikes altogether in the wake of the election			1
‘ chancellors do n't tend to warn the electorate before elections that they are going to raise taxes or not , ’ he pointed out			0
‘ the position whoever wins the next election is going to face is a really big additional consolidation , either further big spending cuts or some tax increases			1
‘ the choice that is open is to continue with spending cuts such that a whole range of bits of public spending will end up being one - third lower than they were in 2010 , or to do some of it through tax increases			1
‘ in previous post-election budgets - think of 2010 , 2001 , 1992 - all of those post-election budgets have seen tax rises			1
‘ six billion pounds would be the sort of level of tax increase you would want in order to keep to the 80/20 spending - tax rule that he sort of set for himself back in 2010			0
‘ coincidentally , it 's also the average increase in taxes we 've seen after each election over the last 30 years			0
’ pledge : chancellor @entity11 said there was no need for more tax rises however mr @entity11 has made clear that it is possible to find the money from more cuts instead increasing taxes			1
@entity128 ministers have already suggested they will look at banning under - 25s from claiming housing benefit and limiting child benefit payments to the first two children			0
‘ we ’ve just demonstrated that we can deliver £ 11.5billion of spending cuts in the spending round , ’ mr @entity11 said			2
‘ this can be delivered through spending savings , both in welfare and in departments and there is no need for tax rises to contribute to that consolidation			1
’ he told the @entity26 : ‘ i do n’t think we have reached the end - point in reforming welfare			0
’ his bullish approach comes as the outlook for the economy is improving			0
mr @entity11 claimed that ‘ opposition to what i am doing in the economy is crumbling ’ after @entity151 agreed to accept departmental spending limits he has set in 2016 and 2017 .			2

chancellor says deficit reduction will be done through spending cuts alone
@entity151 is planning ' big tax increases ' if @entity160 wins election
but @entity4 says without tax rises health and pensions will come under pressure
