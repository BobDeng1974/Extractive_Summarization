@entity0 has given the biggest backing yet for @entity2 to carry on as @entity4 ’s one - day captain for the @entity5 while rounding on the critics who continue to seek to undermine him			1
@entity4 ’s coach was in combative mood at the end of his first season back in charge as he was again asked about the position of a captain who continually has to justify himself in some quarters as both a player and leader			1
‘ @entity2 is a very fine one - day player but nobody wants to talk about that , ’ said @entity0 after @entity4 ’s thrilling @entity20 victory over @entity21 to complete the international season			1
under pressure : @entity0 has lauded under - fire @entity4 captain @entity2 public backing : @entity0 believes @entity2 is the right man to lead @entity4 at next year 's @entity5 ‘ they want to say he ’s out of form or talk about whatever he ’s not doing right			1
i think it ’s harsh criticising him as a player			0
‘ he has shown an enormous amount of fortitude to go through some of the criticism he ’s had despite being the player he is			0
all players go through highs and lows			0
he ’s had a tough time and come through the @entity44 series by scoring runs			0
‘ he would have loved to have gone on and scored hundreds in the one - day series but he ’s still scored more hundreds than any other @entity4 player since the last @entity5			1
' he ’s scored four to everybody else ’s two and five in all			0
he ’s still in the top 10 runscorers in the world since the last @entity5			0
’ @entity0 said after @entity4 lost the one - day series 3 - 1 to @entity21 that nobody ’s place was safe and @entity53 understands the coach and selectors will consider three or four changes to the squad that will play in @entity58 in november			1
yet as far as @entity0 is concerned @entity2 ’s place is clearly not in doubt			1
‘ what i said was absolutely clear , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we are going to sit and look at every position , which is right because we ’ve got to pick an @entity4 team to win a @entity5			2
' it would be wrong not to look robustly at every player in that team to make sure we do it right			2
‘ @entity2 has worked extremely hard with the young players coming in and i like the way he has done that , i really do			1
but it would be wrong for me to start saying now that this is our captain and this is our side			0
’ selection changes : @entity53 understands @entity0 could make three or four changes to his @entity77 squad the selectors plan a series of meetings culminating in picking a squad for the seven - match series in @entity58 on september 23			1
‘ i will go into that meeting and i will have my view , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it ’s pretty clear			0
i ’ve got a huge amount of respect for @entity2 as a player and captain and i think the questioning of him has been unjust			1
' you can hear pretty clearly how i feel about @entity2 but i am one of four selectors and this is me being fair to the other three			2
i will listen to all views then we will do what we think is right			0
’ @entity4 ’s tactics have been criticised by some as being out - dated but @entity0 is adamant that the problems against @entity21 were more to do with not executing plans properly rather than any weaknesses of strategy			1
opening encounter : @entity4 's opening match of the @entity107 sees @entity0 ' side take on @entity109 ‘ i do n’t think the strategy is that complicated , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you need people up front to bat well and go on			0
they increase their scoring rate the longer they are in and there ’s areas you have to be good at			0
' we ’ve got to be able to find the ropes against spinners in the middle overs and we have to set up the batters who can strike at the end of the innings			0
’ @entity4 will give their players a break before they step up their one - day preparation ahead of that @entity5 which starts against @entity109 in @entity128 on february 14			1
‘ this is quite an opportunity for us , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ now we ’ve got to pick an @entity4 team to win a @entity5			0
’ and that team looks sure to have @entity2 at the helm .			0

@entity0 has *labelled* @entity2 a ' fine ' one - day player
the @entity4 coach has *warned* his players that nobody 's place is safe
@entity0 is expected to make changes for series against @entity58
