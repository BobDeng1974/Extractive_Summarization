a star was born in @entity1 – but @entity2 ’s twinkling century could not save @entity3 in the first one - day international against @entity4			1
as @entity2 caressed his way to the third - fastest one - day hundred by an @entity3 batsman , it felt like caviar and champagne compared with the top - order stodge that has too often weighed them down			1
but , of the rest , only @entity12 could pass 35			0
and if that spoke volumes for the quality of @entity2 ’s innings , then it also confirmed a familiar tale : not for the first time , @entity3 ’s 50 - over team had come up short			1
@entity4 's players celebrate after sealing their 25 - run victory over @entity3 in @entity1 @entity23 opened the bowling for @entity3 but @entity25 ( right ) gave him a torrid time set 318 , more than they have ever chased to win a one - dayer , they were all out for 292			1
close , but no cigar			0
for @entity2 , though , this could be the start of something special			2
back in june against the same opponents , he had exhibited his more stoical side , batting virtually all day to take @entity3 to the brink of a famous draw in a test at @entity37			2
now he vindicated the management ’s decision to promote him to the opener ’s role , carving his first delivery over the covers and barely pausing for breath en route to a 25 - ball half - century			2
@entity25 ( left ) goes inside out over the covers as he gets @entity4 off to a flying start @entity49 also produced some lusty blows at the beginning of the @entity4 innings @entity49 ( centre ) was the first @entity4 batsman to go , run out by @entity54 @entity55 holds his head after a chance goes begging in the @entity4 innings on friday , across town at the @entity59 , @entity2 had got there in 21 balls , smiting the first six of them to the fence			1
the magic had not deserted him			0
‘ he has an amazing ability to time a cricket ball from the word go , ’ said @entity55			2
it ’s just frustrating not to win a game when you have a hundred like that			0
’ @entity2 was lucky to survive on seven , when the ball rolled back on to the stumps without shifting a bail , and again on 72 , when @entity78 spilled a straightforward chance at deep midwicket			2
but the plea from @entity3 ’s new batting coach @entity82 has been to loosen shackles – and that is rarely achieved without a risk or two			2
@entity2 understands this , and it was a joy to watch him use his feet to lift left - arm spinner @entity89 for successive leg - side sixes			1
his century needed just 72 balls : only @entity93 and @entity94 have scored faster one - day hundreds for @entity3			1
it was as if , said @entity98 , he was ‘ batting on a different pitch ’			0
in the end , @entity2 had to settle for 119 off 87 after a providing leg - spinner @entity78 with an anticlimactic return catch			1
yet what , you wondered , might he have achieved had anyone been able to stay with him ? in some cases , the contrast was almost painful			0
twice in two balls during the first over , @entity55 was given out leg - before to his opposite number @entity98			1
twice he asked for reviews , with @entity2 his advisor from the non-striker ’s end ; twice @entity114 ruled the ball was going over the stumps			2
by the time @entity55 was given out leg - before a third time – to the first ball of spin sent down by @entity4 from @entity121 – he had contributed a scratchy 10 from 17 balls			1
@entity25 runs up to the camera with a stump while celebrating the victory he jokingly swings the stump at the camera following his side 's victory over @entity3 @entity130 plays a sweep shot on the way to a half century @entity98 plays one of a few big shots during his innings @entity3 captain cook takes a fine catch running backwards to dismiss @entity138 @entity130 ( left ) and @entity139 successfully appeal for the wicket of @entity55 , despite a review @entity2 plays one of the numerous big shots on his way to a 25 - ball half - century @entity2 sweeps the ball away for another boundary as @entity3 make a fast start to their innings the @entity3 opener was in irresistible form and clubs another ball for four @entity93 61 balls vs @entity4 2014 @entity94 69 balls vs @entity156 2005 @entity2 72 balls vs @entity4 2014 the @entity3 captain has now gone 40 one - day innings without a century , yet his status continues to protect him against the more persuasive claims of @entity162			1
for @entity164 , one of @entity55 ’s predecessors , it was all too much			0
‘ please please @entity3 , ’ he tweeted			0
‘ allow ‪ @ @entity166 to open with @entity167 ...			0
’ @entity168 made a pleasant run - a - ball 35 before nibbling at @entity138 ’s bustling seam , but failures for @entity54 and @entity172 – who has gone 13 innings without a fifty – meant @entity2 had to slow down and take stock			1
@entity168 gave @entity177 support after @entity55 's dismissal and here punches one through the off - side @entity138 ( left ) celebrates after having @entity168 caught at slip and breaking the partnership and when @entity93 chopped @entity183 on to his stumps for 21 , @entity3 had lost four for 52			1
@entity12 , back in the side at the expense of @entity187 , did his best , but the damage had been done			0
@entity172 is bowled all ends up by @entity189 for just one @entity93 looks back in dismay after playing on to leave @entity3 five down @entity2 raises his bat and takes off his helmet after scoring his maiden odi century for @entity3 earlier , the @entity3 attack – without @entity195 , who was nursing a groin niggle – fell apart as @entity121 ’s 88 , plus fifties for opener @entity49 and @entity130 helped @entity4 to an imposing 317 for six			1
@entity200 ’s off - breaks were steady under fire , and @entity23 looked menacing until his last over leaked 21			0
but @entity202 gave away 66 , and @entity203 36 in four overs			0
why @entity12 was given only four overs himself – going for a relatively miserly 15 – was a mystery			0
just as concerning was that @entity3 bowled 17 wides			0
for a while , it looked as if these flaws might be forgotten and forgiven			0
but @entity2 was running out of partners			0
soon , both he and @entity3 ran out of luck			0
@entity203 plays a watchful shot down the ground during his scratchy innings @entity12 nurdles one round the corner as he tries to increase the tempo for the tourists @entity203 looks behind him as he is stumped by @entity139 off the bowling of @entity220 @entity12 hits a six on his way to a half century but despite his efforts @entity3 fell short the second delivery brought what seemed a costly slip by @entity203 at long - on , his fumble allowing @entity98 to get back on strike for a two - and he then hit the next two balls for six			1
but the @entity4 captain 's bid for a hat - trick of maximums foundered when @entity203 held his nerve under a high ball at long on			1
@entity200 then strangled @entity130 caught - behind down the leg - side , and it was he instead on a hat - trick - a curiosity feat he must try to complete in @entity3 's next match			2
for the second time in the innings , @entity3 had taken two wickets in quick succession - an effective stalling mechanism , until late hitting from @entity78 helped to plunder an ultimately telling 54 in the last five overs .			2

@entity2 scores third - quickest odi hundred by an @entity3 batsman
tourists could not *capitalise* and lose by 25 runs
@entity25 top scored for @entity4 with 88 in hosts ' 317 for six
@entity3 captain @entity55 won the toss and chose to field
