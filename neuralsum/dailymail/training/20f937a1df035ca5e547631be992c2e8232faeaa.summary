many teams have tried to replicate the playing style of the dominant tiki - taka @entity3 side , but @entity4 are taking it one step further by imitating the @entity9 giants ' ' tequila sunrise ' kit			1
the @entity10 unveiled their new away strip on friday and it would have looked awfully familiar for fans of @entity13			2
that 's because the new kit looks just like the orange and yellow blend that @entity3 sported back in the 2012/13 season			1
@entity29 and co lost just twice in all competitions while wearing the eye - catching uniform			0
new manager @entity39 is hoping to improve fortunes at @entity31 this season after a disappointing campaign last time round			0
and if they can play anything like @entity3 - even the misfiring version of last year - @entity10 fans will have an exciting season in store			2
unmissable : @entity49 and co will stand out on the pitch in the @entity53 next season eye catching : @entity54 keeps his eye on the ball but fans might be distracted by the kit			0

@entity10 new strip looks just like @entity3 's from 2012/13 season
@entity4 will be hoping they can match @entity66 side 's *performances*
@entity68 and yellow blend will be on show at away grounds next season
