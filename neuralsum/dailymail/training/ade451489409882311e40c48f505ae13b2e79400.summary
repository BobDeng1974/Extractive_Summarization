by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 is on course to be recalled by @entity4 for the second test in @entity6 on saturday , after returning to full training following his shoulder injury			1
the 27 - year - old @entity10 scrum half was ruled out of the series opener at @entity12 last weekend in unfortunate circumstances , following a freak training - ground accident			1
care hurt himself after attempting a low kick only to miss the ball and fall awkwardly – prompting wild amusement among team - mates and coaches until his predicament became clear			1
back to fitness : @entity2 , training indoors on monday in @entity1 , is set to return for @entity4 on saturday freak accident : the @entity10 ' scrum half fell while kicking ahead of the first test and injured his shoulder in his absence , @entity30 of @entity31 started in the no 9 shirt in the first test , but he was unable to deliver a fluent performance and there is a strong chance that @entity2 will now be brought straight back into @entity4 ’s starting xv			1
his outstanding displays during the @entity39 will no doubt count in his favour as @entity41 and his assistant coaches finalise their selection prior to the official team announcement on thursday morning local time			1
should the exuberant @entity46 reclaim his place , he will resume his half - back partnership with @entity49 and the @entity50 gave an emphatic endorsement of his qualities			1
‘ i played with @entity2 for the first time in the @entity39 and loved it , ' he said			0
‘ he 's obviously a world - class player and someone who can take any opportunity that comes			1
not only that but he can make something out of nothing			0
to be able to play off the back of that is huge			0
@entity2 's a brilliant player			2
’ @entity49 was asked if he and others destined to replace players who performed so well in narrow defeat at @entity12 feel guilty about doing so			0
taking chances : @entity30 deputised for @entity2 at @entity67 but did n't make the mark he would have hoped in form : care was impressive in the @entity39 and for @entity10 in their late - season charge into the finals he said : ‘ i do n't know about guilty			1
they 'll want to do it justice			0
‘ any time you pull that shirt on you wanted to do yourself justice and you do that by performing			0
everyone wanted those who played on saturday to do well			2
in this camp the team comes first			0
' it 's not about us as individuals ; it 's about what 's best for us as a team			2
’ @entity4 must win at the @entity91 on saturday in order to keep this three - match series alive and @entity49 described it as a ‘ massive ’ occasion on that basis			1
the tourists will go into it full of renewed conviction that the @entity99 are beatable			0
‘ they 're the best team in the world for a reason , ’ said @entity49			0
‘ what they 've done over the last two years has been unbelievable			0
we want to challenge ourselves against them because ultimately that 's where we want to be , but we have a huge sense of self - belief and back ourselves against anybody			2
’ late blow : the world champion @entity99 beat @entity4 with a try at the death in the corner from @entity117			2
