love taking selfies , shedding pounds on the 5:2 diet and finding love on @entity4 ? sorry , you 're officially uncool			0
socks and sandals , pheromone dating parties , ' @entity6 ' and hybrid food were today hailed as the coolest new trends of 2014 , while @entity12 , hot yoga , the 5:2 diet and app dating are going down in the style stakes			1
a new ' cool report ' found brits are increasingly looking to street styles and sub cultures to dictate their own trends rather than follow the opinion formers of the past			1
sorry @entity24 , you 're officially uncool ! a new ' cool report ' has asked brits to vote for what 's hot for 2014 - and selfies are out the research revealed that 68 per cent of those polled voted @entity12 , a celebrity social media staple , as well as smartphone dating craze , @entity4 , as ' not cool '			1
instead , life drawing classes and pheromone parties , the latest dating craze where people pick out a partner based on their natural smell , are considered cool by over three quarters of twenty something @entity26			1
when it comes to fashion , 73 per cent of those polled think @entity44 , and the socks paired with sandals trend are two of the coolest looks			1
in @entity49 : birkenstocks , a footwear favourite of the early 2000 's , are back with a bang , while new fusion food trends like ramen burgers ( right ) are perceived as cool while dungarees and bum bags have recently been hailed ' must - haves ' for pulling off the oh - so - now 90s throwback trend , the report classed them as items to leave at the back of the wardrobe in 2014 with over 87 per cent of people voting these as ' not cool '			2
the research also found that the kale phenomenon is well and truly over in the eyes of the public , as is the restrictive 5:2 diet			0
in its place is a celebration of food with hybrid concoctions such as ramen burgers , and baking both hailed as cool by over 70 per cent of those in their twenties			0
and it 's not just food we 're looking to have fun with , when it come to fitness , the gruelling ' hot yoga ' trend - loved by celebs such as @entity86 - scored low on the cool barometer and has been replaced with ' @entity6 ' , which has been deemed cool by 86 per cent of those asked			2
get a whiff of this ! sniffers get stuck into t - shirts as they search for a compatible match at the first - ever pheromone party in @entity94 popular : on average , users open the @entity4 app seven times a day - with almost a billion matches since it launched 18 months ago - but sorry hopeful romatics , it 's no longer cool the brand new subculture of fitness is a cross between yoga and voguing - the 1980s @entity109 drag scene dance craze - and encourages people to inject enjoyment into their fitness regime			0
a spokesperson for @entity113 , who conducted the research , said : ' what 's really interesting is that historically trends have been established by celebrities , high fashion and opinion formers and then trickled down into the mainstream			0
' however today it seems street style and subcultures are dictating the trends , which are now filtering up			0
' the @entity125 has proved that the power lies with everyday people and today 's twenty - somethings are n't waiting around to be told what 's cool and what 's not , they 're establishing that for themselves			2
' in and out : @entity134 ( left ) is tipped to be the hot celebrity of the year , while twerker @entity136 has been hailed uncool @entity137 and @entity138 @entity139 : 2 @entity140			1
