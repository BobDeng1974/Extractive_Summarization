by @entity1 reporter published : 00:20 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 12 june 2013 maybe it ’s a good thing @entity3 is n’t returning for a second season of @entity5			1
the multi-platinum @entity6 singer failed to guide even one contestant into the final on her first and only run with the talent show			1
but the @entity13 bombshell was not the only ‘ small and humble ’ one – she gained a partner in defeat when @entity18 ’s final contestant was simultaneously eliminated too			1
despite @entity3 ’s confidence in her protégée 's ‘ phenomenal voice ’ @entity28 , a young mother from @entity31 , was booted out by the voting public			1
‘ she works so hard and has so much determination , and that ’s what it takes to make it in this industry , ’ said the @entity35 songstress before @entity28 was sent home			1
@entity43 frontman @entity18 also suffered a blow when his last donkey in the race , a blonde who models herself on @entity51 , albeit without the songwriting ability , was rejected too			1
oh brother : the @entity54 siblings looked doomed as they were up against favourite @entity28 enough to make your nose bleed : @entity57 was feeling the pressure just before the lucky act staying in was announced the @entity61 singer has spent weeks waxing lyrical about @entity64 girl @entity63 and repeatedly tried to convince viewers of her ‘ talent ’			1
‘ one of the best things about @entity63 is that she can do anything … the luxury of having @entity63 on your team is that she can do anything , ’ he said before she was ejected from the competition			1
the double elimination left notorious ‘ booze lover ’ @entity86 in top place with two contestants left - country music cutie @entity80 , 16 , and the @entity83 - based duo @entity84			1
‘ i have been lucky this year , i have two acts with superstar potential , ’ grinned @entity88 singer , 36 , who is married to fellow musician @entity89			1
@entity92 was left with his self - confessed ‘ nerd ’ and hot favourite to win @entity95			2
do n't cry : @entity28 was less than pleased after her hopes of stardom were dashed by the audience vote out of the race : @entity18 's final hope @entity63 proved to be more of a donkey than a thoroughbred rubbing it in : @entity86 could not help but savour the moment after two of his acts made the final @entity95 is also one of @entity3 ’s darlings , @entity18 keeps saying he ’s ‘ in love with her ’ and as the weeks grow the humble singer seems to gradually grow in confidence			1
but the bespectacled @entity115 native still looked shocked when she discovered she was the first contestant to be saved from elimination by the voters			2
‘ it ’s crazy , every single person on this show is so talented that my brain is just like ‘ wait … what ’s happening ? ’ she mumbled afterwards to host @entity124			2
‘ @entity95 is a winner … it ’s about connecting yourself to a real emotion and she does that , ’ purred @entity125 , an eight - time @entity126 winner and new judge for @entity5			2
meanwhile lightly regarded four - piece @entity133 dropped in to play the drum - heavy track my songs from their new album			2
talent scout : perhaps the country favourite should give up music so he can find new acts piece of @entity54 cake : @entity57 ran up to his charges to congratulate them after the results were announced @entity148 : the two jokers could only comfort each other after their high profile humiliation towards the end of the tune alternative music - lover @entity95 jumped on stage to join in			2
in keeping with the show ’s tradition for reeling in former contestants @entity156 ’s former student @entity155 hit the stage			2
the heavily bearded dad of three , hailed as one of the most talented contestants from last season , played a soulful new tune , @entity165			2
then @entity166 , a @entity18 finalist from @entity5 ’s second season , played his soft rock single @entity168			0
wearing a bowler hat @entity166 was keen to praise the overexposed rock star in boosting his music career			0
‘ @entity18 is a man of his word , he signed me to 222 records and he ’s taking me out with @entity43 , we ’re going to tour with them in september , ’ he said , speaking of the lable that his former mentor runs			0
specs appeal : @entity125 wore a pair of lucky glasses and they paid off as @entity95 romped through enjoying the show : @entity125 was then able to watch with detached amusement as his fellow mentors were put through the wringer ‘ we really vibed together and became really close really quickly , ’ agreed the tattooed ‘ metrosexual ’ from the coaches panel			0
before @entity63 and @entity28 were guillotined the top five sang a final tune together – a muted version of @entity194 by glam metal band @entity195			0
@entity198 rocker @entity197 from @entity200 season three showed off his prolonged sideburns while singing his break - up ballad pictures			0
' i have pictures of @entity57 all over my mantle piece at home but i ’ve been asked to take them down because they are inappropriate , ’ he joked			0
getting the acts together : they managed to overcome the fear of the chop to deliver a limp performance of @entity194 @entity214 idol : @entity198 rocker @entity197 delivered a @entity216 performance of pictures ‘ every time i hear you sing i get excited , ’ said @entity57 , grinning			0
the contestants and coaches were given a chance to mock the each other - leading to myriad jokes about @entity125 ’s eccentric fashion taste and @entity57 ’s southern - gent accent			0
dressed up to imitate @entity227 pouted out one of his favourite mottos : ‘ luck favours the prepared			0
’ @entity18 ’s tattoos were also a hot topic for jest			0
‘ @entity18 ’s tattoos are not real , ’ said @entity57			0
the two wallies : the @entity84 proved to be more little and large than @entity236 and @entity237 take that : @entity3 will be disappointed to end in failure with no acts making it through to the grand finale ‘ i ’ve seen him without the tattoos and he has a farmer ’s tan , ’ he laughed			1
‘ @entity249 has a tattoo of deer poop on a trail , ’ shot back @entity18 in his defense			0
the @entity254 brothers giggled that @entity57 has a ‘ laugh like @entity256 ’ but he got his own back by making them wear duplicates of @entity3 ’s skimpy cutaway leotard			0
' unless you are @entity3 you ’d have to be stupid to wear that , ’ hooted the @entity261 crooner			0
next week the contestants will battle it out to win the public ’s heart in the season finale , where @entity268 and @entity269 , 67 , will be the special guest stars			1
must try harder : after an improved performance on monday @entity272 was once again a poor man 's @entity273 on tuesday cheque it out : @entity3 provided some local newspaper fodder by posing with a giant novelty cheque for her charity foundation after the show still a @entity280 : it is hard to believe the saucy @entity282 gave birth just a few months back in january			1
