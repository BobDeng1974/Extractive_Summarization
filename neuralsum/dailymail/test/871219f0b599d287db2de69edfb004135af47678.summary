the widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from @entity4 to @entity5 has won a six - figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road			1
@entity10 , 51 , died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four - inch deep pothole			1
just a month before the tragedy , the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard			2
but it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary			0
@entity22 has received a six - figure payout after her husband @entity24 ( both pictured ) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four - inch deep pothole tragedy : experienced cyclist mr @entity10 , 51 , was riding from @entity4 to @entity5 for @entity29 when he died coroner @entity30 told mr @entity10 's inquest last year that there was ‘ no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident ’			1
he said the pothole , which surrounded a roadside drain on the @entity42 near @entity43 , @entity44 , had ‘ existed for some time prior to the accident ’			2
a month before the tragedy in 2011 , a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts , but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team			1
in the following weeks , the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before mr @entity10 cycled along it with two friends raising money for @entity29			1
he was flung from his bicycle by the pothole , landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries			1
his widow @entity22 , 49 , from @entity64 , @entity65 , has now reached an out of court settlement with @entity68			1
however the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist 's death			1
a coroner previously ruled that the state of the @entity42 ( pictured ) , near @entity43 , @entity44 , was ' the cause of the incident ' after the inquest last year , mrs @entity22 said the death of her husband , an experienced cyclist and service engineer , was preventable			1
she said : ' it is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired			2
this should not have happened			0
' my husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved , while raising money for charities close to his heart , but it has cost him his life			2
the council inspected the pothole in the weeks before mr @entity10 's ( pictured ) death but decided it did not need repairing ' i am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done			1
the road was also inspected monthly as it is an a-road , but despite the danger being recorded in may it was n't repaired			0
' to make it worse there was another inspection in june carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway			0
' no attempt was made to check an already identified defect , how can this be acceptable ? ' ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole , despite being warned it was a potential danger , and i would like to know why something was n't done			2
' i do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained , ' she added			0
the @entity120 concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges			0
mrs @entity22 said the decision had left her devastated : ' my husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen			0
' i have lost my best friend and soul mate , a lovely person , who bought joy to my life , i am now lost and lonely without @entity24			0
' and it is n't just me			0
@entity24 's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity68 said : ' @entity140 accepts no liability for the tragic death of mr @entity10 , the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with mr @entity10 ’s widow , to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation			1
' the county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection			0
' we continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public			0
