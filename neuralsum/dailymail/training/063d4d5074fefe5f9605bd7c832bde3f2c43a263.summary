by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 has criticised @entity4 ’s decision to ‘ photobomb ’ @entity5 with a @entity6 after he won last year ’s @entity8 finals			1
stressing he always plays as a @entity10 , yhe tennis ace said he ‘ did n’t like it ’ when the first minister unfurled the flag in the @entity14 , moments after his dramatic win over @entity17			0
mr @entity4 was widely criticised at the time for trying to hijack the sporting triumph to push his case for @entity21 independence , with critics telling him to ‘ put it away dear ’			1
as the crowd stood to applaud @entity2 ’s win in straight sets , he pulled the @entity6 out and waved it around directly behind mr @entity5 ’s head			1
the move was seen as a crass attempt to politicise one of the crown jewels in the sporting calendar			0
now , almost a year later , @entity2 himself has admitted he was not happy with the stunt			1
in an interview with the @entity47 he said had met mr @entity4 after winning the @entity48 in 2012			1
‘ he seemed perfectly nice to me but i did n’t like it when he [ @entity4 ] got the @entity21 flag up at @entity8 , ’ @entity2 said			1
mr @entity4 defended his behaviour last year , insisting it had been a long time coming			2
@entity53 spoke out against independence @entity4 today expressed surprise at @entity56 president @entity53 issuing a public warning against independence			1
mr @entity53 last week said the @entity56 wanted @entity58 to remain ‘ strong , robust , united and effective ’ , adding : ‘ from the outside , at least , it looks like things have worked pretty well			2
' in response , mr @entity4 told @entity64 's @entity63 : ; it was certainly surprising , because the @entity56 government had made it very clear they were staying studiously neutral in the democratic referendum that is taking place in @entity21			1
' but then of course , @entity5 has been begging everybody internationally to say anything to help with his travails at the moment			2
he ’s right to be worried , incidentally – the latest yes poll ’s at 46 per cent			0
' so perhaps on the @entity77 of presidential interventions , this was pretty mild			0
it ’s a matter for the folks of @entity21 ; he hopes that the @entity81 will be strong and united as an ally			2
well , if @entity21 becomes independent , @entity56 will have two allies in these islands , not one			2
' ' it ’s the first scot since @entity88 in 1896 – it ’s not something that happens very often , so i think a few saltires hoisted over @entity8 does n’t really harm at all , the @entity86 leader said			0
' this was after the match was finished , incidentally			0
this was part of the celebration			0
' and the answer is no , i am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal box			0
' i had the flag last year , actually – i just did n’t get the chance to wave it			0
' but @entity104 education secretary @entity103 said at the time : ' i think it was a wee bit of a stunt ... my advice to @entity4 would just be " put it away dear "			1
' @entity2 remains cautious about being seen to express a view on the prospect of @entity21 breaking away from the @entity81 , but he insisted he had always played as a @entity10			1
he added : ‘ i started competing for @entity58 when i was 11			0
‘ i ’m 27 now and i ’ve been competing for @entity58 for 16 years			0
’ a year before winning the @entity8 championships in 2013 , @entity2 won gold on the same court in the @entity115			2
but he said he did not know who he would play for if @entity21 does go it alone			2
voters in @entity21 will decide whether to back independence in a referendum on september 18			1
while recent polls have suggested support for independence is growing , an @entity121 last week put @entity124 on 36 per cent and @entity125 on 54 per cent			0
politicians on both sides of the debate have locked horns on the merits and dangers of breaking up the @entity81 , but few @entity21 celebrities have spoken out in fear of alienating half of the country			1
actor @entity136 is backing the @entity124 campaign , while singer @entity138 , comedian @entity139 and cyclist sir @entity140 have voiced doubts about independence			0
those who have urged @entity21 to stay in the @entity81 – including singer @entity143 – have been viciously criticised online by the so - called @entity144			1
mr @entity4 insisted that there was nothing wrong with celebrating the first scot winning @entity8 since 1896 @entity2 suggested this was playing a part in his decision not to express a view either way			1
' i do n’t know even when i was younger whether that is something i would have talked about , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s very difficult to have an opinion these days because half the people will agree with you and half of the people will think you ’re an absolute idiot , ’ he said			0
a spokesman for mr @entity4 said : ' @entity2 is reigning @entity162 and a great @entity21 tennis player			1
he has made it clear a number of times that he does n't want to comment on @entity21 politics			2
' everyone should just accept that and let him get on with playing tennis , rather than attempt to put him on the spot about who he would play for in a future @entity173			0
