@entity16 rates @entity5 ’s chances of making saturday ’s trip to @entity77 at evens , but @entity7 should recover in time			1
the pair are fast forming one of the @entity10 ’s deadliest duos and now have 11 goals between them			1
@entity83 was furious his side had failed to heed his warning about the pair			2
‘ i ’m disappointed because the players lacked intensity and we knew their main dangers were @entity5 and @entity7 , ’ he said			1
@entity7 ’s goal 17 minutes from the end was reward for a fine performance			2
collecting the ball from @entity43 on the left he cut in between two @entity2 defenders and finished emphatically			0

@entity5 slipped the ball through to the 22 - year - old on the edge of the box and in desperation to avert the danger @entity24 got too close , giving @entity7 reason to fall			1
@entity5 stepped up and dinked a @entity31 penalty that @entity109 would have been proud of			1
it was his seventh goal of the season			0
he is out of contract next summer and @entity0 are anxious to tie down their star player			0
of equal concern is the fact both players could be off to the @entity117 in january to represent @entity118			0
‘ we want forwards who have good reputations , ’ said @entity16			2
@entity122 shows his delight at scoring and is congratulated by @entity0 team - mate @entity43 wolves had been stuttering a little and dramatically collapsed in their last match at @entity127 to draw from 3 - 0 up			2
those late goals brought the total conceded in their previous four games to 11 , having begun the campaign letting in only three in eight			0
they were much tighter last night			0
@entity2 did put @entity0 under pressure after the opening goal , and @entity16 was annoyed his team seemed to slack off			1
first @entity136 set up @entity62 , whose half - volley was n’t the cleanest but looped over @entity35 and onto the crossbar			0
then @entity62 played in @entity64 , who fired a strong shot that @entity35 punched to @entity62			0
his strike hit @entity38 and as appeals for handball went up from the visitors @entity136 tested @entity35 again			0
soon after , @entity35 held from @entity62 ’s header			0
the @entity0 ’ goalkeeper almost allowed an equaliser after the interval , however , slipping as he caught @entity148 ’s cross and taking the ball perilously close to crossing the line			0
wolves reacted and twice went close			2
@entity41 somehow contrived to miss when @entity42 ’s free - kick from the left found him inside the six - yard box			0
@entity43 then sent his downwards header into the post from the same position when picked out by @entity42 from the other flank			0
@entity7 doubled @entity16 's side 's lead with 13 minutes to go as @entity0 moved up to fourth in the table			1
