this is the dramatic moment a team of @entity3 agents trick their way into a @entity6 casino hotel room to smash a suspected @entity8 illegal gambling ring - by dressing up as computer repairmen			1
the suspects were holed up in a luxury villa at the world - famous @entity13 casino where they had numerous computers set up which the feds believed were being used to place illegal bets			1
to trick their way in the agents cut off internet access to the room and then dressed as the casino 's computer technicians so they would be invited in to try and fix the problem			1
once inside they used hidden lapel cameras to film the scene , collecting footage of laptop screens showing lists of betting odds which they now hope can be used to help secure a conviction			1
the video shows investigators devising code words to use while they were inside , a back - and - forth about the cover story for an agent , who adopted the name ' @entity40 , ' which he had used ' for other stuff ' in the past , and a brief exchange about how another investigator should dress for the role of a technical repair nerd			1
' if you put on that shirt , you have to look the part			2
go all the way , ' said @entity51 , an outside technician working for @entity52 , advising @entity54 agent @entity53 before @entity53 headed to one of the suites the morning of july 4			2
the @entity57 obtained about 30 minutes of audio and video recordings of the covert reconnaissance recorded over two days			2
on another visit to a villa on july 5 , @entity53 appeared to try to fix an internet outage for several minutes while glancing around the room and asking more than once to view a laptop screen to verify that internet connectivity was still down			1
defense lawyers said in their filing that @entity68 , the @entity3 agent , was sent inside because he spoke @entity69			1
still undercover , @entity53 appeared to call @entity51 from inside the villa and asked him to ' check the frame , ' the code they had previously worked out			1
in a brief back and forth , @entity51 responded that he would ' trace the wire and make sure it 's tied down good			0
' defense lawyer @entity75 , who is challenging evidence the government collected in what he described as an illegal search , said that was code to turn internet access back on			1
after the agents left the villa , @entity53 was recorded saying he saw the internet address of the website that defendant @entity83 was operating , adding , ' @entity83 had the odds up on his page the whole time			1
' federal authorities described @entity83 , 50 , as a high - ranking member of the @entity8 , a @entity69 organized crime group			0
@entity75 said @entity83 denied that allegation , which he said had nothing to do with the criminal case in @entity97			0
@entity83 , his son @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and four others were arrested in july after federal agents raided three high - roller villas at the hotel			1
all eight face charges of transmission of wagering information , operating an illegal gambling business , and aiding and abetting			1
none of defendants has entered a plea , but @entity75 said they all deny wrongdoing			0
@entity83 also faces charges of running an illegal sports gambling business in @entity116			2
he was arrested in the @entity69 gambling enclave on june 18 and flew to @entity6 a few days later			0
the @entity3 employed the ruse against the recommendation of an assistant @entity121 attorney , @entity120 , according to defense lawyers			0
they filed a 54 - page motion late tuesday night in federal court in @entity6 to dismiss evidence in the case			0
according to a conversation recorded by an investigator for the hotel , the prosecutor told @entity3 agents ' it was a consent issue , ' the lawyers said			2
under @entity121 law , a person whose property is inspected generally must waive his constitutional protections against unreasonable searches unless authorities obtain a warrant			0
evidence collected improperly is not supposed to be used at trial			0
the @entity3 in @entity6 referred questions about the practice to the @entity145 there			0
@entity146 , a spokeswoman for @entity121 attorney @entity147 , said prosecutors were aware of the allegations being made by defense lawyers but declined to comment , citing a pending trial			0
the gambling case was at least the third to surface in recent weeks raising questions about tactics by federal agents pursuing criminal investigations			2
the @entity157 set up a fake @entity159 account using photographs and other personal information it took from the cellphone of a @entity165 woman arrested in a cocaine case in hopes of tricking her friends and associates into revealing incriminating drug secrets			2
in another case , the @entity3 sent a fake news story it attributed to @entity57 to trick a suspect in a bomb - threat case into clicking on the website link and revealing his location			0
the @entity57 objected that the @entity3 's practice was ' unacceptable ' and ' undermined @entity57 's credibility			0
