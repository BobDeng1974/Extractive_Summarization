by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 11:32 est , 19 november 2012 the parents of a three - year - old boy with cerebral palsy hope he will be walking by @entity4 , after doctors said @entity6 could help relax the muscles in his legs			1
@entity10 was diagnosed with the condition after he was born prematurely at 29 weeks			0
over the years his leg muscles have tightened to the extent that he can no longer walk			0
doctors told @entity18 's parents @entity16 and @entity19 , that the wrinkle - buster could help but there was a 12 - month waiting list on the @entity23			1
@entity10 will have the life - changing treatment to relax the over-active muscles in his legs the couple from @entity28 , @entity29 , began fundraising to help pay for private botox treatment			1
local residents helped raise £ 7,000 to pay for the treatment			0
but after the three - year - old ’s condition worsened last month , the @entity23 will now carry out the treatment on december 14			1
the money raised will now be spent on intensive physiotherapy for @entity18 at the @entity38 in @entity39			1
although @entity6 first achieved fame as a cosmetic drug used by celebrities to smooth out wrinkles , it also has a number of medical uses such as treating migraines and incontinence			1
@entity6 uses tiny amounts of botulinum toxin , derived from the bacteria that cause botulism food poisoning			1
the deadly nerve agent kills by paralysing the muscles used for breathing			2
in tiny doses it relaxes the contraction of muscles in some people with cerebral palsy by blocking nerve impulses			1
this allows better control of movement and reduces the risk of muscle and tendon shortening			0
the effects tend to last from four to six months			0
@entity71 's father ( second left ) and mother ( third left ) at a charity night held to raise money for @entity18 mrs @entity19 , 31 , hopes the treatment could mean that @entity71 will be walking on christmas day			1
she said : ' it will be the best @entity4 present ever			0
@entity18 is such a happy little boy and so determined			2
' i do n’t think he ’s properly aware of what ’s been going on and what ’s going to happen because he ’s still very young			0
' before @entity71 's condition worsened he was able to walk a little with a walking frame and play with his two older brothers and older sister			0
mrs @entity19 , a part - time care assistant , said : ' as a mum i feel useless that i ca n’t do anything apart from massage his legs to take the pain away			0
' said she had been humbled by the generosity of fundraisers			0
she added : ' it means everything because without everybody ’s help @entity18 would n’t be able to have the physio afterwards			2
' if the treatment works and @entity18 ’s walking again and in less pain , it ’s all thanks to @entity105 am so thankful to everybody that helped			1
' i ’m making @entity18 a scrapbook with stories about the fundraising so when he is at an age he can understand , i can show him			2
' mrs @entity19 and mr @entity10 , a builder , 33 , will take him to the physiotherapy centre for intensive therapy in january			2
staff at the centre will teach mrs @entity19 how to continue the treatment at home			0
the remainder of the money will go on physiotherapy equipment and essential alterations to the family ’s home			0
it is estimated one in 400 people in the @entity129 have cerebral palsy , where a part of the brain , usually the part that controls the muscles and movement , is affected .			1
