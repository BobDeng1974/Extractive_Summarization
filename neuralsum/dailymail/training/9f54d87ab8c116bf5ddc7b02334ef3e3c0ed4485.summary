by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 13:57 est , 7 january 2014 a little girl who was not expected to survive for 24 hours after her birth is set to take part in a 10k walk to raise money for the hospital that saved her life			1
@entity10 , now three , was born with the main arteries in her heart the wrong way around and with a rare and potentially life - threatening infection she picked up in her mother ’s womb			1
her parents , @entity18 and @entity19 , were delighted when their little girl arrived , but just seconds later the new born turned blue and was fighting for breath			1
@entity10 ( pictured with her parents , @entity19 and @entity18 ) was born with the main arteries in her heart the wrong way around and with a severe infection			1
her parents were warned she would probably not survive she was so sick doctors warned the couple , from @entity28 , near @entity29 , that they did not expect her to survive			1
she needed life - saving hypothermia treatment , where medics reduced her body temperature to just @entity33 to prevent damage caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain			1
she also battled countless complications , five weeks on a ventilator , and four major operations - the first at just one day old			1
but against all odds , @entity10 is now like any healthy , active toddler			1
and to thank the hospital and the ‘ hero ’ surgeon who saved her , in april she will join family and friends by taking part in the @entity50 to raise money for @entity52 which supports the @entity53 at @entity54 , in @entity29			2
mrs @entity10 , 36 , said : ‘ to look at her , you would n’t know there had been anything wrong			1
@entity10 ( pictured in hospital as a baby ) was thought to be healthy when she was first born but she rapidly turned blue and started to struggle to breathe ‘ she ’s a great wee walker and if she gets tired on the walk we can put her on our shoulders			1
there will be enough family there , i ’m sure she ’ll get there in the end			2
‘ she ’s such a fighter and so strong - willed and i think that ’s why she ’s here , at the end of the day			2
‘ but we can never repay everyone at @entity54 for saving her life			2
’ @entity10 was born at the @entity76 in @entity77 on june 27 , 2010 , weighing a healthy 8lb 5oz			1
mrs @entity10 got to hold her briefly after she arrived , but @entity10 made only the faintest of sounds and started to turn blue			1
@entity10 had to have four major operations and spent five weeks on a ventilator but she is now a healthy child at home with her parents she was whisked away to intensive care where she was hooked up to a ventilator			1
doctors at @entity77 , who thought she had swallowed potentially deadly fluids in the womb , managed to keep @entity10 alive until she could be transferred to @entity53 in @entity29 for specialist care			1
but as the neonatal ambulances in the area were all being used , she had to wait for one to arrive from 40 miles away in @entity93			0
she was nine hours old when she arrived at @entity54 , where tests confirmed she had transposition of the great arteries			2
the condition meant the main arteries were swapped around , starving her body of oxygen			2
@entity10 ( pictured in hospital with her father , @entity19 ) had to have life - saving hypothermia treatment after her birth - it saw medics reduce her body temperature to just @entity108 to prevent damage caused by a lack of oxygen mrs @entity10 , a teacher , said : ‘ it was devastating			1
when she was born we were expecting this perfect baby			2
but when she did n’t make a proper cry it was just a tiny noise , i just panicked			0
i was in my own room and my baby was n’t with me - she was n’t even in the same hospital			0
‘ at my 20 week scan she was lying the wrong way so i was called back so they could check her heart and we were told it was normal so we just assumed everything was fine			1
‘ we even joked , at least we know the heart ’s ok			0
’ but at just a day old @entity10 needed an emergency operation to create a hole in her heart to help her circulation			1
mrs @entity10 ( pictured with @entity10 in hospital ) said : ' she 's such a fighter and so strong - willed and i think that 's why she 's here , at the end of the day			1
but we can never repay everyone at @entity54 for saving her life ' the life - saving procedure is normally carried out by surgeons but as they were all in theatre , her consultant made the decision to carry it out on the ward			1
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ the procedure involved going through a vein in the groin to get to the heart			1
but she was so sick it was impossible for him to tell the difference between a vein and an artery and unfortunately he chose the artery			0
‘ the artery collapsed and she had to have a graft of the artery to repair it			0
but this ultimately saved her life because if he had n’t done it right then she would n’t have made it			0
her consultant was just amazing			0
’ doctors also confirmed she had a major infection , group b streptococcus , which affects just one in 2,000 babies , and warned that @entity10 might not survive her first night			1
the bacteria are found in one in three women and normally have no effect on babies but on rare occasions mothers can pass it on to their unborn child			0
@entity10 is now to take part in a fundraising walk to help raise money for the hospital that saved her life mrs @entity10 said : ‘ i was discharged from @entity77 that evening and i went straight to @entity54 and almost immediately a team of medics - there was about five of them – explained to us how ill our daughter was and that they did n’t know if she was going to make it			1
‘ it was just a complete rollercoaster			0
there were so many ups and downs			0
sometimes she would seem to be doing fine , and then the next our world was turned upside down because she had crashed			0
‘ she was attached to hundreds of wires and machines			0
it was like a @entity191 send every time a machine was taken off her because it was a step closer to her getting better			0
’ however , she had to wait until she had battled the major infection before she could have her nine - hour open - heart surgery at two weeks old			1
following the operation , @entity10 seemed to be doing well and at six weeks old she was finally allowed home			1
after @entity10 had been released from hospital for the first time , she had to be rushed straight back to have part of her bowel removed			2
she was in hospital for another two months before finally being allowed home for good but the family ’s joy was short - lived			1
@entity10 was home for just one hour when she had to be rushed back into hospital for emergency surgery that night to have part of her bowel removed			1
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ it was hurdle after hurdle			2
‘ it was hard to stay positive but we had a lot of support from the hospital staff and our families			0
’ mrs @entity10 hailed her surgeon , @entity216 , a ‘ life saver ’ and a ‘ hero ’ , adding : ‘ we can never repay everyone at @entity54 for saving her life			1
‘ they were just wonderful and so dedicated			0
we ca n’t thank them enough			0
’ mrs @entity10 said : ' it was hurdle after hurdle			2
it was hard to stay positive but we had a lot of support from the hospital staff and our families			0
' @entity10 is pictured in hospital @entity10 spent two months clinging to life in @entity54 before she was finally allowed home for good			1
and since that day her family has never looked back			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ it was a dream come true when we finally got her home			1
we were just over the moon			0
it was great waking up each day and getting a cuddle from my daughter and being able to do normal things that families do			0
’ and when she attended her daughter ’s nursery nativity last month , it was a moment she never thought would happen			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ i was sitting watching her with a lump in my throat bursting with pride			2
mrs @entity10 said : ' it was a dream come true when we finally got her home			1
we were just over the moon			0
it was great waking up each day and getting a cuddle from my daughter			0
' @entity10 is pictured after surgery ‘ when you are standing beside her hospital bed you do n’t envisage seeing the next day , never mind a few years down the line			2
but there she was , standing on the stage as an angel , doing all the actions			0
‘ we ’re lucky we had such a happy ending , ’ said mrs @entity10			2
‘ we are very fortunate and feel so blessed and thankful every day to @entity54 and when she ’s older , hopefully , @entity10 will take on fundraising for @entity52			2
’ in the meantime , the toddler , who loves swimming , dancing and riding her bike , will join her family and friends on april 27 at @entity271 for the 10k @entity50 in aid of the charity			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ what she has come through is remarkable and she amazes us every day			2
’ transposition of the great arteries is a condition in which the two main blood vessels leaving the heart - the pulmonary artery and the aorta - are switched			1
this means the pulmonary artery is joined to the left ventricle and the aorta is joined to the right ventricle when it should be the other way around			0
as a result , blood flows to the lungs to pick up oxygen but is then pumped back to the lungs rather than around the body			0
blood flowing around the body is unable to reach the lungs to pick up oxygen so just continues circulating			0
children with the condition require surgery to correct it			0
without this , they will not survive			0
the condition affects about one baby in every 4,000			0

@entity10 was born with arteries in her heart the wrong way around
she also had a life - threatening infection she picked up in the womb
her parents were told she would probably not survive her first night
she had four major operations and spent five weeks on a ventilator
she is now completely healthy and at home with her family
