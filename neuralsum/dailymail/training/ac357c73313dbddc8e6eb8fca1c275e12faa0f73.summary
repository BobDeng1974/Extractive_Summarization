the founder of a @entity2 women 's rights group faces being excommunicated from her church after leading a demonstration in @entity5			1
two months ago @entity6 defied church orders to led hundreds of people in a rally at @entity10 to highlight gender inequality in the @entity2 faith			1
on sunday , she received a letter from the bishop of her @entity16 congregation telling her a disciplinary hearing had been set to discuss her being removed from the church			1
removed : @entity6 may be excommunicated from her church over a rally to highlight gender inequality in the @entity2 faith @entity6 , who founded @entity21 , said she was shocked , dismayed and devastated by the letter , which informed her that a hearing had been set for june 22			1
she has been accused of apostasy , which was defined as repeated and public advocacy of positions that oppose church teachings			1
the church has also made similar moves to excommunicate @entity31 , who created a website forum for mormons who were questioning their faith			1
he received a letter on monday from a church leader in @entity38 , @entity39 , that told @entity31 to resign from his faith by june 18 or face an excommunication hearing			2
the letter said church leaders were concerned by comments he had made recently about no longer believing fundamental teachings of the @entity2 faith			2
the cases against the two lifelong members of @entity54 mark the most high - profile examples of excommunication proceedings since 1993 , @entity48 , a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at @entity51 , said			2
that year , the church disciplined six @entity2 writers who questioned doctrine , ousting five and removing a sixth temporarily			2
change : @entity6 , right , founded the @entity21 group that wants the priesthood to no longer be solely for men church leaders seem to be drawing a line between private or informal expressions of discontent with church teachings and public protests aimed at pressuring the church , @entity48 said			1
' the @entity54 is not a democratic institution , and has never claimed to be , ' @entity48 said			2
' so such actions are interpreted by church leaders as attempts to displace or undermine their legitimate authority over church policies and teachings			2
' singling out two critics of church policy who have made themselves very visible seems like ' boundary maintenance ' by the church , @entity81 , a retired religion professor from @entity82 who is a @entity83 expert on the church , said			2
' they are saying to folks " if you go this far , you are risking your membership " , ' @entity81 said			2
church officials said in a statement wednesday that there is room for questions and sincere conversations about the faith , but that some members ' actions ' contradict church doctrine and lead others astray '			0
in certain cases , local leaders step in to clarify false teachings and ensure other members are n't misled , the church 's statement said			0
disciplinary hearings come only after members are counseled and encouraged to change behavior			0
' some members in effect choose to take themselves out of the church by actively teaching and publicly attempting to change doctrine to comply with their personal beliefs , ' the statement reads			0
' this saddens leaders and fellow members			0
' even if @entity6 and @entity31 are kicked out of the church , the door will remain open for them to repent and return someday			1
excommunication is not a lifelong ban			0
nobody has solid numbers on how many church members are excommunicated each year , but the number is probably between 10,000 to 20,000 , a fraction of the 15 million worldwide members , said @entity131 , a member of the @entity54 church who analyzes membership numbers with the nonprofit @entity134			1
removed : @entity31 could also face excommunication after starting an online forum for mormons who were questioning their faith @entity6 and @entity31 both hope to be allowed to continue to be members of a church that they love and that has been a part of their lives since birth			1
both served @entity2 missions and were married in temples			0
@entity6 , an international human rights lawyer , said she stands behind everything she has done since forming @entity21 in 2013			1
she said she has not spoken out against church leaders or church doctrine , saying only in public that men and women are not equal in the faith			0
the bishop 's letter does n't include precise examples of why they accuse her of apostasy			0
her group drew the ire of church leaders in april when they marched in @entity10 in downtown @entity5 and asked to be allowed in a meeting reserved for members of the priesthood , which includes most males in the church who are 12 and older			1
they had been told previously they would n't be let in , and warned by church leaders to stay off church property to preserve the sanctity of general conference weekend			0
mormon church officials say the women 's group views represent only a small fraction of church members			0
@entity6 does n't plan to attend the june 22 disciplinary hearing in @entity16 , calling it ' both cowardly and @entity181 like ' to hold the meeting after she had moved to @entity39			1
she does plan to send in a package of letters from friends , families and other members of @entity21 about how they 've been inspired and their faith strengthened by joining the group			0
@entity6 said the feminist @entity2 movement wo n't die even if she 's kicked out of the religion			1
' disciplining arbitrarily and unfairly one person is not going to stop this movement , ' @entity6 said			1
@entity31 , a doctoral candidate in psychology who previously worked in the high tech industry , said he believes he 's being targeted not only for the website , @entity196 , which he started nine years ago , but also for his outspoken support of the lgbt community			0
he said he has no plans to take down the website or back down from being an ally for gays and lesbians			0
but @entity31 said he worries about the effects the upcoming proceedings may have on his four children and wife , and @entity2 everywhere who have misgivings			0
' excommunicating me sends the message to thousands of church members who are struggling with doubts and questions that they are not welcome in the church , ' @entity31 said .			0
