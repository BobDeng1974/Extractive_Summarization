by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity3 's first - ever city centre zip wire has opened in @entity4 , whisking riders at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour			1
flying 115 feet above shoppers and tourists below , the exhilarating ride last for one minute , depositing thrill - seekers safely at the end			0
but for radio presenter , @entity13 , the ride lasted just a little bit longer than planned			1
@entity15 , a sponsor of the @entity16 , sent one of their breakfast show hosts , @entity19 , up to try it out - with some unforeseen results			2
@entity19 's ride started all well and good , but about 40 seconds in , she unexpectedly halted - dangling high above the pavement			1
' am i stuck ? ' she asks once she realises the zipline has stopped short of the end platform			2
the zip wire ride started innocently enough with @entity19 breezily whizzing along above @entity4 's centre thankfully , a ride operator came to get her a few minutes later			1
the @entity16 opened on august 9 and will offer rides through september 6			0
individuals can also sign up for @entity15 's @entity33 to raise money for disadvantaged children			0
a birds eye view : from 115 feet up , @entity4 's main streets look down right miniature panic sets in when @entity19 realises that her ride has stopped short of the end platform			0

@entity44 host tries out the radio *station* 's @entity16
