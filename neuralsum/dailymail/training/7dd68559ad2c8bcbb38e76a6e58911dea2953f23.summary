brought violently to the public consciousness by hit tv shows such as @entity192 , they make users alert and awake but also agitated , paranoid , confused and aggressive			0
the crystal form ( right ) is the most powerful and addictive			0
some compare it to crack cocaine as both are smoked and give an intense , powerful ‘ high ’ followed by a very severe ‘ comedown ’			0
it can trigger delusional or psychotic episodes and in the long term wreaks havoc with users ' skin and general health			0
