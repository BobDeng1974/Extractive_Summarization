by @entity0 ever wanted to step inside your favourite video games ? now you can thanks to headgear that transforms games into virtual reality			0
the @entity6 , made by @entity7 , is a headset fitted with a seven - inch screen that is worn while playing certain video games			1
a gamer uses the console 's controller in the normal way but instead of looking at a tv screen , the images are shown through the visor in stereoscopic 3d - making the gamer feel as if they are playing inside the game			1
a gamer uses their console 's controller in the normal way but instead of looking at a tv screen , the images are shown through the visor in stereoscopic 3d - making the gamer feel as if they are playing inside the game developers test the @entity6 headset at the 2013 @entity34 in @entity35			1
it works by tracking the player 's head movements using sensor technology			2
it then uses low - latency mitigation , which is a technique used to minimise the delay between the eyes seeing the image and processing what it sees the @entity6 works by tracking the player ’s head movements using sensor technology			1
it also uses a new technique called low - latency mitigation that lets the players explore the world as if it was a reality			2
low - latency mitigation minimises the delay between the eyes seeing an image and processing what it sees			0
this makes the images appear to be happening closer to real time			2
the @entity6 's display shows two unique images , one for each eye , that the player ’s mind fuses into a single stereoscopic 3d view of the virtual world			1
at this year ’s @entity73 conference in @entity74 , players could immerse themselves in the first game made for the @entity6 – a virtual reality space dog fighting game			1
the prototype model had a 5.6 - inch screen but this was increased to 7 inches to improve its quality after testing			2
the 7 - inch panel 's pixel switching time is faster and reduces latency and motion blur when the wearer turns their head quickly			2
the lcd has also been made brighter and it has colour depth of 24 bits per pixel			0
it has field of view that is more than 90 degrees pn the horizontal and 110 degrees on the diagonal			0
the resolution is 1280x800 , which is around 640x800 per eye			0
each eye image is shown in the panel as a pin - cushioned image that is then corrected by lenses in the headset , generating a spherical - mapped image for each eye			1
the panel 's resolution is expected to be upgraded to 1920x1080 for the final consumer version			2
the weight of the headset is approximately 379g			2
the headset has a dial on each side that can be turned with a screwdriver which allows adjusting each display to be moved closer or further away from the eyes			2
@entity116 , @entity117 , said : ‘ in ' traditional ' , @entity123 games , your field - of - view is fixed forward or controlled with the mouse or keyboard			0
' the @entity6 allows you to look around the game as if you were actually there			1
' this makes the experience much more immersive – you are no longer sat at home controlling a computer spaceship , you ’re a pilot sat in your fighter rocketing around space			0
‘ we decided to make the game as we were all very excited about virtual reality and the @entity6 , and there was a lot of internal interest about doing something with it			1
' the decision to create a dogfighting game in this setting came from a couple of places ; influences from older games such as x-wing vs. @entity146 were a big part , but there was also the inner twelve - year - old in all of us screaming ' i want to be a space pilot ! '			0
' virtual reality is such a perfect fit for this style of cockpit - based game			0
’ in traditional , non-virtual reality games the gamer 's field - of - view is fixed forward or controlled with the mouse or keyboard			1
the @entity6 lets players look around the game , such as x-wing vs. @entity146 pictured , as if they were actually there with the @entity165 and @entity166 on the horizon , @entity164 is keen to see the @entity6 used in next - generation gaming			1
there is , however , no word on how much it would retail for if released			0
@entity171 , vice president of product development at @entity6 , added : ‘ we 'd love the @entity6 to work with next - gen consoles and there are no technical hurdles preventing this from happening			1
' it 's simply a strategic partnership decision for the platform holders			0
' right now , we 're focused on building an incredible , @entity181 platform for the pc , which is a great fit for the cutting - edge nature and requirements of high - end , immersive virtual reality experiences			0
’ for gamers who ca n't wait to experience immersive 3d gaming , the @entity188 cinemizer oled is an alternative to the @entity6 and is available now			1
for gamers who ca n't wait to experience immersive 3d gaming , the @entity188 cinemizer oled is an alternative to the @entity6 and is available now			1
the device has also been used by architects to walk customers through virtual buildings and by drone - pilots like the @entity6 , it is a head - mounted display , however , it was designed for more than gaming			1
it has been used by drone - pilots as well as architects who use them for virtual reality walkthroughs of buildings currently being built			0
it has n't got the same huge field of vision as the @entity6 but the @entity188 cinemizer has a smaller was to make a smaller , sharper image on a lighter head mounted display			1
it has an optional headtracker , too , but this feature is not fully supported by console games yet			0
this headtracker does work with pc games , though			0
the @entity188 cinemizer oled costs £ 599 and the headtracker attachment is an additional £ 189 .			0

the @entity6 headset contains a stereoscopic 3d screen
when worn during *gameplay* the screen 's images are shown on the visor
it 's designed to make the gamer feel immersed within the game 's world
