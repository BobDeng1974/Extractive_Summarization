@entity8 , a writer for the @entity9 , was attending a performance of ' @entity11 , ' described as an ‘ electro - pop opera ’ based on ‘ @entity13 ’ and playing in @entity14 at @entity15 , a temporary structure beside @entity17			1
writing about the incident on the @entity9 ’s website , @entity8 said he recommended the show but thought the audience ‘ horrible - talking , using their phones			1
’ theater critic @entity8 is unrepentant after he quite literally took the law into his own hands and smashed the cellphone of another patron who refused to stop using it during a performance on wednesday night ‘ it was bad enough that i seriously considered leaving during the intermission , something i ’ve not done before , ’ he wrote			1
the audience at the performance were sitting in groups at small tables and each table was explicitly told that photography and cell phone use was strictly prohibited during the performance			2
according to @entity8 the people seated around him failed to comply with this simple request			2
‘ the main offenders were two parties of women of a certain age , the sad sort with too much makeup and too - high heels , and insufficient attention span for following a two - hour musical , ' he wrote			0
' but my date spoke with the theater management during the intermission , and they apologetically assured us that the situation would be remedied			0
’ unfortunately the situation did n’t improve after the interval and so @entity8 asked the woman sitting to his right to refrain from using her phone to access the internet			1
the audience at the performance were sitting in groups at small tables and each table was explicitly told that photography and cell phone use was strictly prohibited during the performance ‘ i asked her to turn it off			2
she answered : “ so do n’t look			0
” i asked her whether i had missed something during the very pointed announcements to please turn off your phones , perhaps a special exemption granted for her			0
she suggested that i should mind my own business , ’ wrote @entity8 , who has a theater column in the @entity72			2
angered by the woman ’s disregard for the rules of the establishment , @entity8 instinctively did something that many people may have fantasized about doing at one stage or another and threw the woman ’s phone unto the floor and away from her			1
asked afterwards if the phone was damaged , @entity8 told @entity95 : ‘ it had to be ; i threw it a pretty good distance			1
’ the woman slapped @entity8 and then after failing to find her phone stormed off to complain to the management			1
' @entity11 , ' described as an ' electro - pop opera ' based on ' @entity13 ' not long afterwards @entity8 received a visit from the show 's security director who asked him to step into the lobby to ‘ have a word			1
’ ' they tried to keep me there			0
he said the lady was talking about filing charges			0
so i waited around for a bit , but it seemed to be taking a while , ' he told @entity95			0
in the end he says he got bored of waiting and so left			0
' in a civilized world , i would have received a commendation of some sort			0
to the theater - going public of @entity14 — nay , the the world – i say : " you ’re welcome , " ' he wrote in the @entity9			0
@entity8 has said he is willing to face the cell phone user in court should she decide to press charges , but in future perhaps she might think twice about using it in the theater .			2

@entity8 lost it when the lady beside him refused to stop using her phone - even after he asked her *politely* to do so
