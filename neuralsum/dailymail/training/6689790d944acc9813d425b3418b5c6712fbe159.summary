by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 08:29 est , 26 february 2013 a headmistress has followed in her young pupils footsteps and got herself a scooter to travel around her school			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , is head of @entity9 in @entity10 which is divided into two separate sites			1
it used to take her 10 minutes to walk in high heels from one to the other until she saw the children zooming between the two on their scooters			1
the 55 year - old decided to copy them by getting her own £ 50 silver model and now saves around 15 minutes a day , giving her more time for her job			0
@entity5 has been using a scooter to travel between the two separate sites of her school , saving her 15 minutes a day the headmistress said that by investing in the £ 50 scooter she is hoping to encourage the school 's children to become more active @entity29 , who has been riding the scooter - complete with l plates - since @entity33 , said : ' it 's just a speedier way of going between the sites			1
' the school is divided up into two sites - one for the early years and year one and the other site across a large field for years two , three and four			2
' for years i 've have been watching the children zooming back and forth on their scooters and i 've always said i should get one of those			0
@entity29 used to walk for ten minutes at a time in her high heels			2
the journey takes only three ' if i was riding a bike from site to site i would have to wear a helmet to set an example to the children and to be honest that would mess up my hair			2
' roller skates would mean i 'd have to keep changing my high heels so a scooter was the best way of getting around			0
' i could take my car but actually it is no faster than walking and this way a 10 minute journey takes three minutes			1
' if i could have afforded one i would have bought a segway but a scooter has certainly raised eyebrows			2
' the headmistress thinks that while it is amusing , parents have had a very positive response			0
she said : ' one parent saw me on the scooter and said " my mother taught me if i ca n't say anything nice do n't say anything at all " which i found funny			0
' the parents have generally seen the funny side of it - i make sure that i have a laugh at it first before they have chance to poke fun			0
' @entity29 has been at the school since 2008 argued that using the scooter means she has more time for the pupils of the school			1
she added : ' when you add up all the time i 'm saving i 'm saving the school precious and valuable time as well as money			0
' school budgets are being squeezed , there is no doubt about it			0
' i 'd say on average i 'm saving at least 15 minutes a day and if you add that up over the week it 's a lot of time			0
' @entity102 has two separate sites that take ten minutes to walk between @entity29 also hopes her scooter riding will encourage more of the pupils to use scooters and bicycles as a positive way to spend their time and get active			1
' we have a lot of children on their bicycles and scooters coming into school with their parents - and i always said i 'd been doing it too one day , ' se said			2
' i think if they see their teacher whizzing around on a scooter it may encourage more to come to school in this way			1

@entity5 bought a scooter for getting around school like her pupils
the walk between the two sites used to take 10 minutes and now takes three
she hopes that the move will encourage other children to get more active
