' @entity9 said : ' i knew about the plan			1

... why did n't i inform the police ? ' a suicide bomber inside one of the clubs had blown himself up , killing many people and forcing others to run outside where the vehicle loaded with the bomb was parked			0
another suicide bomber then blew that up in an attack which eventually killed 88 @entity61 victims and seven @entity62			2
after the bombings , @entity63 was thrust onto the front lines in the battle against terrorism			0

ms @entity84 held out her hand but @entity9 rejected it by putting his right hand on his chest there have been several attacks targeting @entity91 hotels , restaurants and an embassy since then			2
but all have been far less deadly , thanks in part , security experts say , to a relentless crackdown on @entity10 that has largely decimated their ranks			0
@entity9 , who was arrested in @entity100 just over a year ago , told the court the @entity4 bombings were in theory meant to avenge @entity91 policies in the @entity106 territories			2
' from my point of view , it was total failure , ' the suspect told the court , adding he saw ' no connection ' between the original mission , fighting against the oppression of fellow @entity116 , and the target , partying tourists			0
' yes , most of the victims were white , but there were no @entity122 , ' he said			0
' some were even @entity63			0

' i only played a small role , ' he said , acknowledging that he helped mix less than 50 kilograms ( 110 pounds ) of nearly a ton of the chemicals used in the explosives			0
