the cell phone ban at the @entity1 has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes			1
barred from bringing their cell phones on to the @entity8 course , fans have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket - sized digital cameras or their old 35mm bodies and lenses and re-learning how to use them			1
but a quick refresher course is all they 're allowed			2
when play begins on thursday , fans will have to put them back on the shelves			1
a masters patron uses her camera to take photos of the action during the player practice rounds ahead of the 2015 masters at @entity24 in @entity1 , @entity8 , which starts on thursday ' actually , the last time i had this out was @entity29 , ' @entity25 said about the large black @entity30 hanging around his neck			1
and the time before that ? ' no idea , ' he said			2
' probably the @entity29 before			2
' more than a few of the fans lugging around similar equipment were , like @entity25 — who made the two - hour drive from @entity40 — experiencing @entity1 in person for the first time			1
most just planned to mosey around until something caught their fancy			2
some had general targets in mind — a favorite player or two , the trio of back - nine holes reverentially dubbed ' @entity1 , ' or the gigantic manual scoreboard alongside the first fairway			1
then there was the occasional experienced big - game hunter , decked out with camera bags and an array of lenses			1
' i 'm after @entity59 , ' said @entity60 of nearby @entity61 , @entity62			2
' i got a great shot of him the last time i was here — 18 years ago			0
' but there are plenty of guys more serious than i am , ' she added			0
the cell phone ban at the @entity1 has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes like @entity77 ' i had to borrow this from a friend who just had a baby			1
a few minutes ago , i saw a guy actually loading film into his camera			0
now that 's old school			0
' stepping back in time produced more than a few comical moments			1
parked in lawn chairs behind the first tee , two pals leaned in close as one tried to figure out how to take a ' selfie ' with a point - and - shoot camera — never mind that the term had n't even been coined when the camera was originally manufactured			1
behind the seventh tee , @entity96 of @entity97 , @entity98 , recounted the preparations he went through to make sure his 4 - year - old digital camera was ready to roll			1
first , he had to find it — ' it took me awhile to remember where i left it , ' he said , finally remembering it was in a desk drawer — and then make sure it was charged			0
' i 've got a big camera , but i did n't want to lug that around , ' @entity96 added			0
' that 's usually for family events			0
' fans photograph @entity77 on their cell phones during a practice round for the @entity115 - @entity116 at @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119 , last july but he might have had second thoughts when his twin 5 - year - olds saw the camera and realized it was n't a phone			1
' they were scratching their heads , ' he recalled			0
' they said , ' @entity128 , why is it so big ? '' the fact that so many wound up opting for the big camera likely had to do with the number of serious hobbyists			0
while many planned to share their photos with friends on social media , a few planned to commemorate the trip with a photo album — talk about old - school — and in the case of @entity143 , make quality 8x10 framed prints and give them as presents			2
few people , though , seemed as comfortable carrying around all the serious gear as @entity150 of @entity151			0
he was at @entity1 for the 20th time — ' i think that 's right , ' he said , ' because i 've got at least 18 shirts — and said he has a camera around his neck at least once a week			0
' my wife calls it my " pacifier , " ' he laughed , ' because our youngest son plays competitive soccer and she says taking pictures is the only thing that keeps me from cussing and yelling at the refs and everybody else			0
