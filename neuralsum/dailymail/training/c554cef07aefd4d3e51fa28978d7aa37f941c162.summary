by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 5 september 2013 reunion : @entity2 with partner @entity3 , who was told her partner was dying by hospital staff and comforted the wrong man in an ambulance blundering hospital staff wrongly told a patient ’s partner and son that he was fighting for his life			1
they were ushered into an ambulance to accompany @entity2 to a specialist unit			1
@entity3 and @entity16 were told that mr @entity2 , 53 , who had gone to @entity17 with a bad back , had suffered a severe heart attack and was critically ill. in the ambulance , a distraught miss @entity3 comforted the patient , whose face was obscured by an oxygen mask , kissed him on the forehead and told him she loved him			1
but staff at @entity17 had put the wrong relatives in the ambulance and the man miss @entity3 kissed was a stranger of similar age , build and appearance to her partner			1
it was only when a paramedic referred to the patient by a different name that @entity16 took a closer look – and realised from his moustache that the man was not his father			2
mr @entity2 , an industrial cleaner , had called an ambulance to his home in @entity42 , @entity43 , because of agonising back pain			1
miss @entity3 , 63 , his partner of 14 years , came home and spoke to him as he was treated in the ambulance			1
‘ he did n’t look well , but he was certainly not on his deathbed , ’ she said			0
she and @entity16 , 26 , followed the ambulance to hospital in their car			2
as they walked into the @entity17 unit at @entity55 in @entity56 , a woman approached them and said : ‘ @entity3 , can you come with me ? your partner is seriously ill and we need to get him to @entity61 urgently			2
’ confused : @entity3 , 63 , even kissed the mystery patient on the head and told him ' it 'll be okay ' , not recognising him because of his gas mask error : while his family were on their way to @entity70 , @entity2 was sitting in @entity17 at @entity55 , @entity43 ( pictured ) waiting to be assessed and wondering where they were miss @entity3 said she did not question this as two years earlier mr @entity2 had nearly died from a serious heart condition			1
during the journey she asked the paramedic how seriously ill @entity2 was and she was told his chances were n’t good			2
later the paramedic asked : ‘ what did you say his name was ? ’ when she answered , he said : ‘ well , we have n’t got @entity2 in the back here			0
’ serious : @entity2 says that the story sounds like a ' sketch ' but says it could have had serious consequences for the other man miss @entity3 said : ‘ i really thought it was a sick prank , but they assured me it was n’t			1
‘ my only slight comfort was that if this man knew what was going on , he might have felt better knowing someone was there from him			0
’ miss @entity3 and @entity16 had phoned their workplaces to say mr @entity2 could die			1
they had to call back to say it had all been a mistake			0
‘ people ask us how we did n’t realise it was n’t @entity2 , but @entity16 was sat next to him for the whole journey , ’ miss @entity3 said			1
‘ it was only when the oxygen mask came off that we saw he had a moustache			0
’ @entity16 , a sales assistant , said : ‘ part of me was happy because i realised i was n’t losing my dad but then i did n’t know whether this guy in front of me was going to live			0
‘ my mum always told me never to get into a car with a stranger , but never an ambulance			0
’ they continued the 23 - mile journey to @entity61 so the man could be treated			0
the family were later told he recovered			0
the hospital laid on a taxi to take them back to @entity55 casualty department , where mr @entity2 – who had nothing more life - threatening than severe back spasms – had been wondering for an hour and a half where miss @entity3 and his son had vanished to			1
‘ it ’s a bit of a comedy sketch moment when you first hear what happened , ’ he said			0
‘ but then you realise how serious a blunder it really was			0
if the paramedics had asked @entity3 or @entity16 if i was allergic to anything or on any medication , they would have said “ no ” and this man could have been given something that may have potentially killed him			2
’ mr @entity2 spent four hours in @entity17 but collapsed in agony as he was being discharged and ended up spending the night in hospital			2
@entity142 , executive medical director at @entity143 , said mr @entity2 and his family had received an apology for the mix - up			1
identification procedures for relatives were being reviewed , he added			0
investigation : the hospital has apologised for the blunder and has launched a probe which could take three months			0

@entity3 was told @entity2 was having a *coronary*
mystery patient behind large gas mask and under blanket in ambulance
' i kissed him on the forehead and said " it 'll be alright " , ms @entity3 admits
family realise mistake *30mins* later when medic called man @entity168 - not @entity2
@entity43 hospital apologises and is investigating how the blunder happened
