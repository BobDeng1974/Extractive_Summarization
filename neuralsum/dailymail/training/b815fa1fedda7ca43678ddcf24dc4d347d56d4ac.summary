by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:16 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 11 march 2013 @entity2 today rejected @entity3 and @entity4 calls to cut health spending			1
the prime minister , under pressure from all sides ahead of next week 's @entity8 , bluntly rejected criticism that his promise to protect the @entity12 from austerity meant there would be deeper cuts to the army , police , business and councils			1
mr @entity2 said during a visit to the @entity24 @entity23 apprentice @entity21 in @entity25 : ' the @entity12 is not going to be cut by this government			2
' @entity2 , pictured today , rejected the idea of lifting the ringfence on @entity12 spending mr @entity2 and chancellor @entity30 have been caught in a pincer movement between @entity3 right - wing mps like @entity33 and @entity4 minister @entity34 who today both called for an end to ring - fencing for vast swathes of @entity39			1
dr @entity33 called for a three - year freeze in public spending and an end to ring - fencing while mr @entity34 warned it created an ' unbalanced approach ' to public spending			1
but mr @entity2 insisted the health budget would not be touched : ' plenty of people are giving me advice and there is one piece of advice i wo n't take and that is the piece of advice that says " you ought to cut the @entity58 budget "			2
' we made a very clear promise before the last election that yes , we were going to have to take difficult decisions , yes , we were going to have to make some very difficult and painful cuts but we would n't cut the @entity12 budget			1
i think it 's really important for people to know that			0
' it 's really important for people to know how much i care about it			0
the @entity12 was there for me and my family , i want it to be there for other people 's families too			2
' the prime minister was speaking at an event with apprentices at @entity24 @entity23 apprentice @entity21 in @entity25 mr @entity2 said he wanted to make it the ¿ new norm ¿ for school leavers to take an apprenticeship or go to university with 10 days to go until the @entity8 , mr @entity30 faces a bombardment of advice about how to get the economy growing			0
he has received calls to slash taxes , boost house - building and encourage wealth creation			1
a year after the disastrous @entity90 , which lead to a string of embarrassing u-turns on taxing hot snacks , caravans and gifts to charity , mr @entity30 knows his credibility is on the line ahead of the march 20 statement			0
today dr @entity33 , the former defence secretary and a standard bearer for the @entity102 , urged the chancellor to dramatically cut taxes			1
dr @entity33 said : ' the great socialist coup of the last decade was making wealth an embarrassment			1
' it is the prize for aspiration and hard work , and its side effects are higher tax revenues , more jobs and more investment			0
' chancellor @entity30 is under pressure to deliver a major boost to the economy in next week 's budget in a highly - provocative speech to the @entity125 – with the title @entity123 – he argued that money is better left ‘ in people ’s pockets rather than siphoning it off for the @entity130 ’			2
tens of thousands of new homes should be built to help revive the economy , business groups have warned			1
the @entity135 is calling for 50,000 affordable homes to be built , incentives for refurbishing empty homes and the housing guarantee scheme to be extended to all types of housing			1
it wants to shift £ 2.2billion from current spending to high - growth areas without adding to the deficit			2
this would include £ 1.25billion on capital investment – including housing – and £ 950m on high - growth business tax measures , such as a 2 per cent cap on the planned increase in business rates and the removal of stamp duty on equity finance for mid-sized companies			2
separately the @entity157 is warning today that a point may have to consider major cuts in business taxation and joins with the @entity135 in calling for 100,000 additional new homes to be built by 2015			1
dr @entity33 called for capital gains tax to be cut to zero and ‘ reintroduced at a more sensible level ’			2
‘ this would create a tax window where businesses that are sitting on assets might be encouraged to sell , investment in capital becomes more attractive and where hundreds of thousands of second homes might come on to the market , ’ he said			2
and in remarks that put him at odds with @entity2 , dr @entity33 also called for the ring - fencing of @entity12 , schools and foreign aid budgets to be scrapped			1
he warned it is a mistake to exempt these areas from the extra cuts the chancellor will have to make by 2015/16 to balance the books			0
however , @entity182 was cool on the ideas , insisting the prime minister and @entity180 would ' stick to the course ' they have set on deficit reduction			1
in an unlikely alliance , the call for an end to ring - fencing has been backed by @entity4 business secretary @entity34 who denounced it as a ‘ very unbalanced approach ’ to government spending			1
while he said he remained a ‘ strong supporter ’ of protecting the aid budget , mr @entity34 suggested the @entity12 ringfence could be narrowed to cover just ‘ key areas ’			1
‘ there is obviously an argument for protecting key priorities , the aid budget might be one , the science budget is another – we ringfenced that - indeed there are key areas in health which are important , ’ he told @entity200 ’s today programme			1
‘ the problem about ringfencing as an overall approach to policy , is that when you have 80 per cent of all government spending that ’s ringfenced , it means all future pressures then come on things like the army , the police , local government , skills and universities , the rest that i ’m responsible for			2
‘ so you get a very unbalanced approach to public spending			0
i went along with the overall ringfencing approach in this @entity225 – as part of the @entity227 we had to work as a team – but i think as a long term approach to government spending , it is n’t very sensible			0
’ unlikely alliance : both @entity3 mp @entity33 and @entity4 business secretary @entity34 have questioned the decision to protect some areas of spending from cuts however , mr @entity34 poured cold water on dr @entity33 's call for a vat cut to kick - start growth			1
' that is one of the many desirable things that we would love to do if we had more money , ' he said			0
' we have to do what we can afford			0
' instead he reiterated his call for investment in housing and infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy			0
' the priority has now to be to get the economy going , ' he said			0
he reiterated his call for more extra borrowing to invest in big infrastructure projects			0
' the metaphor i ’ve used which helps to explain it – there ’s a difference between increasing your credit card in order to keep a gas - guzzling car on the road , and taking out a loan in order to get a more fuel - efficient car , and the latter is a more sensible form of borrowing			0
' and that ’s what , when people talk about capital investment , that ’s what we mean			0
' once you start investing in genuine capital projects , of course you generate an income			0
' there may be a time lag – it does n’t increase the deficit , the government has to borrow temporarily , but it does n’t do anything to affect the structural deficit			2
' once the economy does get going , you generate more tax revenue , there are less people dependent on public spending and the budget then tends to improve itself			0
' i think that 's the direction we are going in			0
my colleagues in government certainly understand that			0
' on the run : mr @entity30 must prove he is up the job of chancellor after last year 's disastrous @entity90 in recent weeks defence secretary @entity306 and home secretary @entity307 had also spoken out against further cuts to their departments			2
but @entity182 rejected the latest calls from dr @entity33 and mr @entity34			1
mr @entity2 's official spokesman said : ' the government receives many @entity8 representations			0
' the prime minister has set out the approach that the government will be taking in his speech last week , which is best summarised as " sticking to the course "			0
' there will be a 2015/16 budget - setting exercise later this year consistent with the fiscal plans we have set out			0
' mr @entity2 's view remains that spending on the @entity12 , schools and international aid should be ' ring - fenced " from cuts , and that defence equipment budgets should enjoy a real - terms increase of 1 % a year from 2015/16 onwards , said the spokesman			1
the decision to protect the aid budget from cuts has also been backed by @entity23 ’s leading business figures			1
the chief executives of a group of 27 @entity337 companies have come together to ‘ applaud ’ mr @entity2 ’s decision			1
the heads of @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 are among the bosses to have signed a letter in the @entity346 arguing that protecting international aid spending was ‘ not only the right thing to do , but a smart investment ’			1
‘ developing countries become emerging economies and emerging economies became the engines of future global growth and prosperity , ’ the letter states .			0
