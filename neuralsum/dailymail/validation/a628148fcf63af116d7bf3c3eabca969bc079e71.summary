assuming @entity1 do n’t now stumble on the road to @entity3 , they will owe a big debt of thanks to their big @entity6 for firing his country to a major championships for the first time in 30 years			2
not since the 1986 @entity12 have the @entity11 graced a big stage			0
indeed , they have never qualified for the finals of the @entity16			0
but after @entity19 scored twice against @entity20 at @entity21 to take his total in qualifying to five goals in five games , @entity18 ’s side will never have a better chance as they remain one point behind leaders @entity28 following their fourth win of the campaign			1

even if it all goes wrong , this result puts them eight points clear of fourth - placed @entity20 and almost guaranteed of at least a playoff place			2
‘ we ’re in a really strong position , there ’s no doubt about that , ’ said @entity18			0
‘ will 18 points be enough ? possibly			0
but @entity35 in june is as far as we ’re looking ahead			0
’ @entity20 simply could n’t handle @entity19 , the 6ft 4in striker on loan to @entity112 club @entity111 from @entity113 after a frustrating spell at @entity115 , who made life as difficult for them as possible in the blustery conditions			2
he had already caused central defenders @entity66 and @entity68 plenty of problems before putting @entity1 in command with two classy finishes in the space of six minutes			0
the first goal came from a freekick after @entity19 was fouled by an exasperated @entity68 in the 33rd minute			2
@entity20 cleared @entity129 ’s inswinging free - kick but @entity50 nodded the ball back to @entity19 15 yards from goal and he showed fantastic technique to turn and volley it beyond goalkeeper @entity33 and into the far corner			1
@entity135 looked most dangerous down their right - hand side and when @entity46 and @entity41 combined once again in the 38th minute , @entity19 met @entity41 ’s pin - point cross with a glancing header into the bottom corner			1
@entity19 celebrates with his @entity1 team - mates during his side 's 2 - 1 @entity142 qualifier against @entity20 @entity145 stars such as @entity146 ( centre left on back row ) and @entity44 ( centre right on back row ) started for @entity1 it was no surprise to see @entity66 hooked at half - time in favour of the more muscular @entity154 – ‘ a tactical substitution , ’ was the curt response from @entity20 boss @entity157 afterwards – or @entity19 receive a standing ovation when he was replaced by @entity53 11 minutes from time			1
he is now second only to @entity159 in the list of @entity1 ’s all - time leading goalscorers			0
‘ @entity19 was outstanding again and he scored two fantastic goals , ’ added @entity18			2
‘ he ’s going on the pitch believing he ’s capable of scoring every time he plays			0
‘ it ’s a little bit like the @entity159 situation where things at club level are n’t going as well as he would like			0
but he ’s showing what he ’s capable of against top - class @entity172 defenders			0
’ @entity20 substitute @entity76 pulled a goal back in the first of three minutes of added time to set up an unnecessarily nervy finish , but @entity135 held on and the celebrations told their own story			1
