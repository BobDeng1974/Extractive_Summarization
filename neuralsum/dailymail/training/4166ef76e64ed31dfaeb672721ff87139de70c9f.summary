secret phone recordings have revealed that a @entity2 member of @entity3 and top @entity5 leaders went around then - secretary of state @entity6 to negotiate with the @entity9 regime of @entity10 because they were convinced she was hell - bent on taking the @entity11 to war			1
@entity11 's intelligence community was conerned that @entity14 was sanitizing their reports to make the case for military intervention on the basis of an impending genocide in the port city of @entity21 , even though there was scant evidence that @entity10 's military was prepared to massacre rebel groups			1
the @entity11 military 's @entity26 dispatched a middle - man in july 2011 to tell the dictator 's son , @entity29 , that internal @entity31 reports sent to members of @entity3 were ' just full of stupid , stupid facts			1
' the younger @entity10 , later captured after his father 's summary execution and now in a prison cell , told the @entity11 who phoned him behind @entity14 's back that many @entity11 - supported armed rebel groups were ' gangsters and terrorists , ' and ' not freedom fighters			1
' ' stupid , stupid facts ' : @entity6 allegedly had blinders on about @entity9 , prompting generals and a member of @entity3 to conduct their own secret talks with the @entity10 regime @entity9 dictator @entity10 was captured and killed by rebel leaders backed by the @entity11 after @entity14 persuaded @entity50 allies and the @entity51 to suppoort military intervention coming @entity53 : @entity55 democrat @entity54 was a @entity11 congressman when he went ehind @entity6 's back to try to avert military intervention in @entity9 ' and now you have @entity50 supporting them with ships , with airplanes , helicopters , arms , training , communication , ' he said in one recorded conversation with @entity11 officials			1
' we ask the @entity11 government send a fact - finding mission to @entity9			2
i want you to see everything with your own eyes			0
' the stunning story was uncovered by the @entity75 , and fleshed out by interviews with former congressman @entity54 , the @entity55 @entity54 who spearheaded the back - channel talks			2
@entity29 told @entity54 in one taped call in may 2011 that @entity14 's march to war ' was like the wmds in @entity82			1
it was based on a false report			0
' ' @entity9 airplanes bombing demonstrators , @entity9 airplanes bombing districts in @entity88 , @entity9 army killed thousands , etc. , etc. , ' he said then , ' and now the whole world found there is no single evidence that such things happened in @entity9			0
' @entity14 ultimately convinced president @entity97 , the @entity51 and @entity11 's @entity50 allies to green - light military action on the basis of a humanitarian crisis that never materialized , the @entity75 reported thursday			1
@entity102 , a secretary of state under presdient @entity103 , told the newspaper that ' if this story is true , it would be highly unusual for the @entity5 to conduct a separate set of diplomatic negotiations			0
' @entity54 is a dovish anti-nuclear liberal who never voted in favor of military action during his three terms in @entity3 , opposed the @entity113 , and once signed a letter of solidarity with @entity117 strongman @entity116			2
the remarkable thing about his attempts to avert @entity11 military action in @entity9 is the division it indicated in the @entity97 administration			1
it also suggests that @entity14 was the primary driving force behind @entity11 's war footing and later intervention there			1
' there was a distortion of events that were occurring in @entity9 to justify an intervention which was essentially wrong and illegal , ' he said			0
@entity9 was the one place where @entity14 advocated the @entity11 bring military muscle to isolate and depose a foreign leader			2
@entity135 's then - president @entity134 , @entity137 @entity136 sen. @entity136 , and current secretary of state @entity138 have shared that view			2
then - defense secretary @entity140 and @entity26 chairman admiral @entity141 both disagreed since they could n't confirm what @entity14 was telling @entity3 about conditions on the ground			0
@entity14 is widely expected to enter the 2016 presidential race by the end of the spring			0
if she runs , her foreign policy record as the @entity11 ' top diplomat will make the @entity21 case fair came for attack ads and debate questions the @entity75 also faults @entity51 ambassador @entity154 and national security adviser @entity155 for supporting @entity14 by erring on the side of preventing a genocide rather than confirming one was imminent before making the case for war			1
no clear policy : former @entity162 sen. @entity161 criticized the @entity14 - @entity97 @entity9 policy in 2011 , and may run against @entity14 for the @entity2 presidential nomination guilt complex ? @entity51 ambassador @entity154 allegedly was wracked with guilt over the @entity167 genocide and determined to help @entity6 stop another one in @entity9 â€“ despite the lack of evidence for concern gruesome : @entity10 was captured , beaten and killed by rebels in his home town of @entity174 , @entity175 in october 2011 ' @entity155 was involved in the @entity167 crisis in 1994 , @entity154 wrote very moving books about what happened in @entity167 , and @entity6 was also in the background of that crisis as well , ' @entity177 international relations professor @entity176 told the @entity75			1
' i think they have all carried this with them as a kind of guilt complex			0
the secret recordings also show that on the day the @entity51 passed a resolution supporting the use of military force against @entity10 , @entity14 ordered a military general to refuse to take a call with @entity29 and other high - level regime officials			1
the call was intended to help negotiate a resolution and avoid bloodshed			0
@entity10 called for a cease - fire a day later , but the @entity97 administration waved it off			2
@entity161 , a military veteran and then a @entity2 @entity11 senator from @entity162 , questioned the use of force at the time			2
' we have a military operation that 's been put to play , but we do not have a clear diplomatic policy or clear statement of foreign policy , ' he said then			0
' we know we do n't like the @entity10 regime , but we do not have a picture of who the opposition movement really is			0
we got a vote from the @entity215 but we had five key abstentions in that vote			0
' @entity161 has been mentioned as possibly preparign to challenge @entity14 for the @entity2 ' 2016 presdiential nomination .			0

@entity14 will face tough questions about her march to war against @entity10 if she runs for president
phone calls were recorde between @entity10 's son and @entity11 officials , *including* rep. @entity54 , *complaining* that @entity14 's @entity31 was sanitizing intelligence reports to make her case
she ultimately convinced the @entity51 and @entity50 allies to back military intervention there , and persuaded president @entity97 to go along
