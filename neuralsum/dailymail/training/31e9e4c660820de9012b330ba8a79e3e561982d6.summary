by @entity0 it looks likely that @entity2 will return to @entity4 ’s backyard for their rematch - and the winner is virtually guaranteed a world title shot			1
i ’m pushing for an announcement next week ; the fight was originally scheduled for december 6 but with @entity13 ’s injury , november 29 has been mooted			1
it looks like it will be in @entity16 and we ’re tying up the loose ends now but i ’m confident it will happen			2
originally , we were going to be in @entity20 which was a neutral venue but now @entity2 ’s going to be travelling to @entity16 again			1
obviously he would prefer it in @entity23 or at a neutral venue but in order to achieve financial targets @entity16 makes most sense			2
@entity2 looks set to return to @entity4 's backyard in @entity16 for a much - anticipated rematch @entity2 ( right ) would prefer to fight in his native wales but @entity4 's ( left ) @entity16 makes financial sense you have to take your hat off to @entity2 who does n’t seem fazed by returning to @entity4 ’s city			1
if a fighter is not fighting at home , he needs to be compensated			0
although this is only two or three hours from @entity2 ’s home , it is n’t @entity23 and we have a unique situation where i promote both fighters			2
i have a duty to ensure both fighters get the best deal going into this fight which is an interesting scenario			2
i ’m having to deal with both of them so the common sense argument is applied which is that if you ’re at home you should take less than you ’d get if you ’re fighting away			0
that dynamic applies to all fighters , particularly at world level			0
we have already agreed with @entity56 that the winner will face @entity58 for the @entity60 world title and they ’re also happy for the winner , and maybe even the loser , to fight @entity64 for the @entity66 title			1
whilst the fight will carry eliminator status , it ’s actually more powerful than that because terms have virtually been agreed with the champion for the winner			1
both men want the fight badly ; @entity4 in particular			1
he lost the first fight so he wants to settle the score			0
@entity2 does n’t like @entity4 and wants to knock him out			1
it ’s great to be involved in a fight where there is so much on the line			0
@entity2 and @entity4 facing off ahead of their 2011 bout , which the @entity84 won by unanimous decision the one trend in my conversations with them is that they want to knock each other out , they do n’t want to win on points			1
@entity2 said he ’s already beaten him on points now he wants to take him out inside the distance and @entity4 wants to flatten him , quite honestly			1
he ’s a fighter who would be disappointed with a points decision			0
i think we ’ll have a different type of fight to the first one , which was a great fight but at times it was strategic and technical			0
this one will be about emotion , ego and will to win			0
i ’m very fond of both fighters			0
this is the first time i ’ve made a fight at this level where ive promoted both fighters			0
it is difficult but i ’ve told them both that it ’s a great fight and may the best man win			0
whatever happens , there ’s a future for both of them in the division but obviously the winner will go on and do big things			0
it was another spectacular performance from @entity122 last weekend and quite frankly the time is now for the @entity125 fight			1
people have always said it would be great if one of them could pick up a world title , or both could have world titles , well now there ’s no excuse			1
they are both world champions and it ’s really the only fight that people want to see either of them in			2
@entity122 ( left ) impressed in his third round knockout of @entity139 last weekend @entity122 retained his @entity142 @entity141 title in the win and @entity125 must be next we are co-promoting @entity125 ’s mandatory @entity145 but we ’ve seen from correspondence to the @entity66 and @entity147 that @entity125 is injured and will not be able to fulfill his obligation within the stated period			1
it is likely now the @entity66 will grant a medical exemption and give him a further 60 days to make the fight			1
my decision to get involved with @entity156 was two fold			0
one , i feel i can maximize his earning potential through the opportunities and my experience within this market and two it gives me an opportunity to make the @entity164 vs @entity125 fight next while compensating @entity145 accordingly			1
@entity125 has to fight @entity145 by december 4 but now that he ’s injured , he ’ll have to fight him by the end of february			1
his injury puts more pressure on making the @entity169 fight because he ’s now not expecting to fight @entity145 until february or march and i do n’t think the @entity171 public will wait much longer for that fight			0
if @entity125 is not going to be ready until then , i ’ll be looking to get @entity122 out again before the end of the year			1
i ’ve already made contact with the @entity175 and requested a meeting to try and look at the opportunities			0
as i write this , i ’m still waiting for a reply			0
but there are no true obstacles in making this fight , only ego			0
@entity125 won his @entity66 super-bantamweight world title bout against @entity184 in @entity185 only ego is preventing a fight between @entity122 and @entity125 to take place if we do n’t get the opportunity to provide these two great fighters with the biggest pay day of their career , quite frankly both teams should be ashamed with themselves			1
in terms of the location , the fight will happen wherever it makes most commercial sense			0
obviously , we would n’t be able to go outside in @entity185 until june / july through to august or early september			0
the biggest indoor arena in @entity185 is the @entity200 which holds 9,000 but this fight would quite comfortably fill the @entity202 in @entity203 which holds 21,000			0
my idea of a two - fight deal is purely based on giving both fighters the fight in their home town and , more importantly , the opportunity for them to make huge money twice			2
it does n’t have to be two fights but when a financial opportunity like this comes up in the super-bantamweight division , you should be clutching it with both hands			0
@entity13 had his staples out this week			2
many will have seen in the @entity223 story the horrific injury that was sustained but @entity13 is a remarkable healer and is already on his feet			2
i think we will see him back in the gym by the end of october			1
when you see an injury like that you wonder whether you ’ll ever see him in a ring again but thankfully he ’s going to be ok and he ’ll be back firing in no time			2
@entity237 won again at the weekend and , as usual , everyone in the 147lb division will play the waiting game and try to get their shot			1
i said around a year ago i did n’t think @entity237 would fight @entity243 in may			1
i also said he would n’t fight @entity243 in september			1
i ’m now saying he wo n’t fight @entity243 next may			1
@entity13 is a fantastic healer and on the mend after being stabbed on holiday in @entity247 @entity13 has now had his staples out and is expected back in the gym by the end of october now , i understand that everyone wants that fight but there also comes a time when you have to stop hanging around and prostituting yourself for a shot when you have an opportunity to give the @entity171 public what they want in a huge all - @entity171 clash with @entity13 for the world title			1
from our side , we are prepared to go straight into the @entity243 fight			1
i spoke to @entity13 about this and his response was : ‘ i ’ll beat him with one leg ’			2
we are already making plans for @entity13 ’s return in february or march			2
if @entity243 misses the boat and does n’t get the @entity237 fight he really is in @entity274 in the division			1
i reiterate my respect for @entity243 as a fighter			2
he ’s achieved so much in the sport at such a young age but i feel we have an opportunity here to make something really special for @entity171 boxing			0
perhaps he knows that defeat to @entity13 may signal the end of his career			2
@entity243 has failed to get his fight against @entity237 so a clash with @entity13 should be on the cards we have a number of lightweights in our team who are all looking for that world title shot			1
@entity296 ’s surprise win over @entity297 last weekend has triggered a number of calls from our fightes requesting that fight			2
i ’ve put their names in the mix with @entity306 ’s team			0
@entity307 will defend his @entity142 world title against @entity309 this saturday			1
i ’m confident that if he comes through , i can deliver the shot for @entity312 later this year			0
we saw the rematch between @entity314 and @entity315 announced this week			0
although the first fight was disappointing , expect the second to be closer			0
you have to feel for @entity314 , he has had three big fights scheduled and on sale over the last year , and all three have failed to materialise			0
i really hope for his sake , and career , that this one actually happens			0
the rematch between @entity314 ( left ) and @entity315 ( right ) is set for november 29 in @entity325 finally our thoughts and prayers are with @entity328 and his family after he was injured during his fight in @entity20 last friday			1
i was at the fight and the paramedics and doctors reacted within an instant to help him			0
it ’s been amazing to see the boxing community gather to support @entity328			2
it ’s a special sport with special people .			0

@entity2 - @entity4 will likely be in @entity16
the winner will be all but guaranteed a world title shot
@entity122 vs @entity125 is the fight everyone wants for both of them
@entity13 will be back in the gym by the end of october
he wants to fight @entity243 straight away - @entity243 wo *n't* get @entity237
our lightweights are *queuing* up to face new @entity66 champion @entity296
our thoughts are with @entity328 who was injured in the ring on friday
