the grieving family of nurse @entity0 have sent 60 questions to the @entity14 media group behind the hoax phone call and the hospital where she committed suicide			1

the family of ms @entity26 have asked 20 questions in a letter to @entity215 , the parent company of @entity92 , whose djs , including @entity50 , made the call both letters – which have been seen by @entity186 – were sent by @entity226 mp @entity225 , who is acting as a spokesman for the family at their request			2
in a letter to @entity232 , the hospital ’s chief executive , mr @entity225 wrote : ‘ on december 11 the family handed you a list of questions that specifically relate to the hospital			2
they have not had a written confirmation of the answers			2
they now have additional questions [ and ] would like answers			2
’ @entity245 consoles his daughter @entity88 during the burial of nurse @entity0 at her hometown @entity110 , near @entity66 in southwest @entity21 the questions suggest the hospital may not have taken extra security measures during the @entity253 ’s stay			1
the family also ask : ‘ was there any indication that @entity150 was under increased pressure or stress in the weeks preceding her death ? ’ one question suggests ms @entity26 may have been involved in a dispute with a colleague a few weeks before the @entity7 was admitted			0
another implies that the 46 - year - old , whose body was discovered on december 7 , may have been ‘ spoken to ’ by the hospital ’s matron by telephone a day after the prank call			2
the letter to @entity215 asks if there is ‘ any evidence ’ that @entity92 staff called the hospital five times to alert them that they were about to broadcast the prank			2
the letter also questions why no staff at the station or parent company have attempted to contact the family since the hoax call			0
