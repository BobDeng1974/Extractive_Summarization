by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:34 est , 5 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:59 est , 5 december 2013 the president and his supporters are pushing to get higher wages for @entity1 workers , but the nation 's largest pro-obama organizing group is telling its footsoldiers not to expect a paycheck at all			1
@entity12 , which flexed its muscles as @entity15 during two presidential election campaigns , announced wednesday that it 's seeking ' @entity18 ' to ' be a part of our growing organization ' and ' explor [ e ] @entity12 's broad scope approach to issue advocacy			1
' but unlike most fellowships , which offer a stipend or a housing allowance , the positions are strictly ' unpaid ' and require @entity1 to work ' without the expectation of pay , for civic and public service purposes			1
' @entity12 collected $ 7.7 million during the third quarter of 2013 , according to disclosure reports collected by the @entity34			2
the group has raised nearly $ 21 million this year			0
president @entity15 's election machine is now called ' @entity12 , ' and it 's looking for free labor while it pushes for a minimum wage hike on wednesday president @entity15 railed on against big - business efforts to block a minimum - wage hike , while his wealthy campaign machine pushed for free labor to do his bidding an hour before @entity12 announced its 2014 fellowship program , the group tweeted a line from the president 's wednesday speech on the economy			1
' @entity51 if you agree : " it 's well past the time to raise the minimum wage			1
" — president @entity15 , ' the group 's message read			2
three hours later the @entity51 account @entity58 , which @entity12 controls , blasted out an infographic that claimed raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour would create 140,000 new jobs			1
and the group 's website advocates for policies that ' reward work by raising the minimum wage so an honest day ’s work pays more			1
' in a lengthy economic policy speech on wednesday , the president complained that ' there are airport workers , and fast - food workers , and nurse assistants , and retail salespeople who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty			0
' ' and that ’s why it ’s well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when @entity85 was in office			1
' ' wage slaves ' ? fast food workers are picketing @entity90 's restaurants in @entity91 today , as part of the union - led social movement that @entity95 supports thousands marched in front of @entity98 on @entity99 , demanding higher wages for employees			2
unions paid some protesters to show up ; @entity98 has n't budged on its wage policies or its decision to avoid unionizing its workforce ' for all their talk of fairness and justice , supporters of minimum wage hikes hypocritically fail to offer these exact same policies to their own employee interns , ' @entity108 research director @entity107 told @entity116			1
' it ’s a classic case of " do what i say , not what i do			0
" ' @entity12 did not respond to a request for comment			0
the group has operated fellowship programs for several years , including the two presidential election cycles when it was the official @entity15 campaign organization			2
but in those days , throngs of volunteers flocked to ' fellowship ' meetings to learn how they could help elect , and then re-elect , @entity129			0
in the president 's second term , however , @entity12 has found it tougher to recruit cost - free labor			2
june 2012 : hundreds of @entity12 volunteer ' fellows ' packed a hall in @entity137 to learn how they could help re-elect president @entity15 trouble in paradise , may 2013 : an @entity12 organizer proudly tweeted a picture of just two ' fellows ' building a climate - change database for @entity12 ' look , ' a @entity145 election consultant told @entity116 , ' @entity146 is in the trash heap , @entity148 is about to have a nuclear bomb , the @entity150 and @entity151 are as corrupt as a @entity153 mobster , and the @entity154 has become a punchline			1
' ' no wonder the volunteers are staying home			0
' online photos from 2010 and earlier show hundreds of ' fellows ' gathered in meeting rooms to receive their marching orders			0
more recent images circulating on @entity51 and @entity163 show tiny handfuls of volunteers engaged in defending the president and his policy objectives			0
anti-obama partisans lashed out on wednesday after @entity12 launched its search for unpaid workers			2
' do you provide a living wage to do this work ? ' one asked			0
another quipped : ' only if you pay me $ 15 per hour , plus benefits			0
otherwise you are exploiting my labor			0

@entity12 , known as @entity15 during the election season , is advertising for ' fellowships ' to push the @entity154 's agenda
unlike most fellowships , the positions are unpaid and provide no benefits
@entity12 advocates for minimum - wage hikes , but is catching flak for *denying* its own footsoldiers any wages at all
*conservatives* tweeted barbs on wednesday as @entity12 announced its program just hours after @entity15 demanded a minimum wage increase
