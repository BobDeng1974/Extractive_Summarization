gazing at myself in the changing room mirror , i was lost for words			2
i ’d just wriggled into the dress of my dreams			2
but looking back at me was something that resembled the @entity8 man			2
i did n’t just have a visible panty line , but i could practically read the wash - care label			1
after two children , i expect a smidge of mum - tum			1
but , in this dress , i looked at least three months gone			1
i had little pouches of flab poking out from under each armpit , and my bust , which i normally consider one of my best features , seemed to have morphed into a solid bolster of flesh			2
i was n’t just mortified , i was desperately disappointed			1
but , in this dress , she felt she looked at least three months gone ever since @entity28 started designing clothes , i ’ve longed to own one of her dresses			1
i would have killed for that long , simple , stone - coloured gown she wore to the @entity35 party in 2012			1
i was even quietly fond of the billowy , pale - blue tent dress she unveiled last year			1
and i loved her sleek collection , unveiled at @entity40			2
so , as you might expect , i was one of the first through the doors of her @entity45 store when it opened last week , edging past the paparazzi and the gang in high - viz jackets ( who were not , as i ’d assumed from the other end of the street , a group of cutting - edge fashionistas , but merely the builders who had yet to finish )			1
@entity28 has a pair of fluorescent green trainers with ' @entity28 ' on the tongue i ’d taken the precaution of dressing in homage to @entity62 herself : a white shirt , buttoned up the way she does it , skinny trousers , my most impenetrable sunglasses and a designer handbag			1
i did n’t want to be escorted off the premises for looking too scruffy			1
but i need n’t have worried			1
@entity28 had declared her shop would be a welcoming place			1
‘ i think we ’ve all been into stores where we ’ve been made to feel like we should n’t really be there , ’ she said			2
‘ i do n’t want people to feel frightened , or scared to come in			2
’ and , indeed , the intimidating - looking bouncer guarding the door flashed me a friendly smile as i stepped in			2
the place was teeming with an eclectic mix of customers : students in ripped jeans , instagramming everything in sight ; middle - aged women , browsing with bemused husbands in tow ; @entity92 girls , clutching armfuls of handbags and swigging heartily on the glasses of free champagne			2
@entity28 poses in her swish @entity98 boutique , where she says all variety of customers should feel comfortable shopping there ’s nothing so vulgar as a cash till in the store — @entity62 having decreed them ‘ ugly ’ — so , instead , wherever you are , you hand over your card to an assistant , who swipes it through a little machine			1
tragically , i ’d missed @entity112 himself , but @entity113 , the former @entity114 star , was there , examining the sunglasses			0
clearly , @entity62 ’s dream of a shop that could be all things to all people had come off			1
i was almost salivating as i strode up the polished steps ( thank goodness flat shoes are in this season ) to the first floor , in search of the perfect frock			0
on the pin - thin models in @entity28 ’s catwalk show , projected on to a giant screen at the top of the stairs , everything looked irresistible			1
@entity24 tried to emulate the ever - stylish mrs @entity28 with a tailored outfit for her first visit to the boutique upstairs , the ready - to - wear collection was a comparative oasis of calm , scented deliciously with @entity143 ’s @entity142 candles			1
accepting a glass of fizzy , i settled down on a walnut bench and surveyed the clothes			0
they hung on individual gold chains , rather than rails , and i flicked through them with care			0
the prices were sky - high — from £ 900 to £ 3,000 for evening dresses , with one gown at £ 5,800			1
the shapes were classic @entity28 : slim and pared - down , in red , navy , black and white			1
there were perfect little knits , sequinned skirts and gorgeous , @entity164 frocks with graphic patterns			0
i was in sartorial heaven			0
then , i saw it smiling at me : the party dress i had been longing for			0
it was a simple , clingy , black dress in a mix of silk , wool and viscose , with @entity62 ’s familiar , full - length zip down the back and silky contrast on the shoulders			1
it looked as though it had been made for me			2
it cost an eye - watering £ 1,625			1
but , i reasoned , such a classic shape would never go out of fashion and it would be supremely flattering			0
there was just one slight problem : there were only two of these dresses on the shop floor — one in a size eight , the other in a ten			1
i ’m a size 14 , although in some shops i can get away with a 12 on my bottom half			0
would a fashion designer famed for her bird - like frame even bother dressing a woman like me ? now , surely , was the moment i would be politely asked to leave and never darken her dainty doors again			2
i took the plunge and turned to the assistant who , like all the staff i saw , was tiny and perfectly formed			0
perhaps that ’s no surprise , since @entity62 reportedly picked them herself , but it was starting to make me feel like @entity209 in @entity210			1
an assistant escorted me to one of the huge changing rooms and came back with three different size 14 frocks			0
‘ would you like heels to try them on with ? ’ he offered			0
‘ oh yes , please ! ’ i said			0
‘ i ’m a size eight			0
‘ i think we only go up to a size seven , but i ’ll go and look			0
’ although the store 's opening saw fans queuing outside , @entity24 says the sky high prices are inaccessible for the average clothes shopper the instant he ’d gone , i reverently slipped the first dress from its padded hanger and stepped into it			1
this glorious garment , i just knew , was going to skim over my lumps and bumps , while holding me in in all the right places			0
unfortunately , the dress had other ideas			0
in fact , i had a bit of a problem even getting the zip done up			0
and when i looked at myself in the mirror , i did n’t know whether to laugh or cry			1
i had hoped to look like @entity245 , but before my horrified gaze stood something that looked like an exploding bin bag			2
when the assistant came back with the bad news that even my feet were too big for this shop , i asked , in a whisper , whether he had the dress in a size 16			0
@entity256 still loves @entity28 ’s clothes but will not be back in her beautiful shop until she has dropped a couple of dress sizes to his eternal credit , he did n’t sneer , or even raise a groomed eyebrow			1
he simply explained , politely : ‘ we ’re working on it			0
’ and perhaps he was even telling the truth			0
but , as i slunk back down the stairs , feeling fatter than ever , those runway models seemed to be gazing accusingly at my wobbly behind			0
following in the teetering heels of @entity113 , i made my way past the sliding , concrete door			0
a reporter rushed up to me , keen to hear my first impressions of the shop			0
but i was in no mood to chat			0
frankly , i just wanted to be left alone — with a packet of @entity277 biscuits			2
i still love @entity62 ’s clothes			1
but i will not be back in her beautiful shop until i ’ve dropped a couple of dress sizes .			0

after two children , @entity24 expects a smidge of mum - tum
but , in one of @entity62 's dresses she felt she looked at least three months gone
since @entity28 started designing dresses she longed to own one
she was n’t just mortified , she was desperately disappointed with the items
the prices were also sky high — from £ 900 to £ 3,000 for evening dresses
