beautiful firework ? an ultra-magnified image by @entity26 , which captures how hair follicles help heal wounds by supplying new cells , is one of a series of images by researchers from the life sciences subjects at the @entity23			1

his picture might look like an abstract piece of modern art , but it is actually an ultra-magnified image showing a polystyrene particle that is five times smaller than the diameter of a human hair attached to a cleaning hair removed from an ant 's antenna			2
he created the first of its kind image using a special microscope in a bid to show how insects keep healthy using specialised cleaning devices			0
@entity59 used a new method to look at the cerebral cortex			0
the result is the @entity63 ( pictured ) , which is a colourful image showing how the brain is randomly split into a thousand pieces , to highlight how researchers identify the same areas of different brains @entity37 's picture might look like an abstract piece of modern art , but it is actually an ultra-magnified image showing a polystyrene particle that is five times smaller than the diameter of a human hair attached to a cleaning hair removed from an ant 's antenna another picture , taken by @entity82 , shows a mighty @entity84 iron - wood trunk lying on a forest floor in the state of @entity87 in @entity89 @entity88 , which is all that is left of a site that has been cleared to make way for an oil palm plantation			1
‘ @entity89 is a leading producer of palm oil and the industry has provided a hugely valuable boost to the economy and many jobs , ’ she explained			0
‘ however , vast areas of forest have been lost , posing major threats to biodiversity			0
‘ it is unusual to see such a large trunk left abandoned in a plantation , and this offers a particularly poignant reminder of the forest that has been lost			0
