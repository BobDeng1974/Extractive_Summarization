@entity1 administrator @entity0 has launched an investigation to determine whether there were any behind - the - scenes irregularities that may have resulted in the team 's demise			1
the @entity8 - based marque are back on the grid at this weekend 's last race of the current @entity12 season in @entity13 after being given dispensation to miss the last two in the @entity16 and @entity17			1
a crowdfunding project that has so far raised £ 2million has extended the life of the team and put them back in the shop window , with the hope a buyer will come forward and take them into 2015 and beyond			1
@entity1 administrator @entity0 is investigating if any irregularities lead to the team 's demise @entity1 's new driver @entity28 in talks with a team member during the first practice round @entity0 sits at a telemetry booth in the pits during the second practice at the @entity36 circuit @entity0 , serving as interim team principal , concedes he has three weeks at most to secure a new owner otherwise the plug will have to be pulled			1
in the meantime , it is also part of his duty to look into why the team has ended up in such a mess following a takeover in june			1
a consortium of @entity50 and @entity49 businessmen took up the reins passed on by @entity53 entrepreneur @entity52 , owner of @entity54 and chairman of @entity57 side @entity56			2
the consortium , however , bailed out in october , citing an issue over the transference of shares , with @entity52 claiming he had not been paid			0
@entity0 is determined to get to the bottom of the matter for the sake of his creditors , on whose behalf he is working to ensure they get a return on monies owed			1
speaking in the paddock at the @entity36 , the 54 - year - old @entity69 said : ' as administrator i 'm clearly trying to sell the business			0
' but another thing i have to do is investigate how the business was run			0
anybody who was running it improperly or who owes it money i have a duty to investigate them			0
' if i think they 're guilty of an offence , like wrongful trading or misfeasance , then i have to pursue them and get money back for the creditors			1
' my investigation has already started , but the thing about it is you can do it after the heat of the sale , so i 'm just getting all the papers together and my lawyers are going through those			2
that is a different phase			0
@entity1 's @entity28 during the first practice day at the @entity13 grand prix the finale of the @entity12 season comes to a close in @entity13 on sunday ' but a number of people have already said to me they really believe there were things that went on here that need to be investigated			1
' naturally of more pressing concern for @entity0 is his desire to find a buyer and secure the futures of the 230 staff he had to make redundant last week			1
in @entity13 there is a skeleton crew of 40 people readying the cars , all of whom are working on a consultancy basis for a nominal payment , with another five back at the factory in @entity8			2
@entity0 added : ' i 've had 50 approaches , and i think there are four parties who are serious			1
' my analysis shows who they are and what they 've got			0
for a couple of them it would make perfect sense for them to buy it			0
' one purchaser i 'm talking to , who is a perfect fit , is talking about a couple of months down the road			0
' they 've asked me not to sell the building ( the factory ) yet and to give them time to get a deal together			0
' i 've said to them the employees will drift away , and they 've said it 's a huge decision , that they hear what i 'm saying , but they 'll do it in their own time			2
' so that 's one of the purchasers not going to chomp now			2
' then there are some wealthy @entity49 people i 'm meeting while i 'm over here who could be one of those multi-billionaires who buys a team because they want one			2
' they want to be an owner in the most exclusive club in the world			0
' but as @entity166 says , it has to be run by people who have a financial basis			0
