@entity0 has been ruled out until the new year after sustaining yet another injury setback in training on tuesday			1
the @entity3 international is expected to miss @entity6 's next 12 matches - leaving @entity7 short of forward @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity11 are yet to hit the back of the net in the @entity14 so far this season while @entity7 will have to pay a hefty fee if he wants to recall @entity17 from @entity18			1
we asked @entity22 fansite 's @entity20 about @entity0 's latest injury			1
another international break , another @entity0 injury			2
it 's all getting very predictable now , only @entity7 ca n't blame @entity27 for this one			1
as @entity3 made easy work of beating the @entity30 all @entity6 fans could do was despair , as the saviour of our season had again limped out of training			1
surely this could n't be happening to us again ? but while @entity27 was n't at fault , surely somebody now has to shoulder the blame for the fact that our season 's success - or failure - has hinged for so long on the fitness of a player who , historically , has often missed as many games as he 's played in a season			1
@entity0 is expected to miss @entity6 's next 12 games after sustaining yet another injury @entity0 's only goal of the season came against @entity52 on the opening day of the league campaign if @entity0 is out for the next 12 matches , he will miss the following fixtures for @entity6 : @entity57 ( a ) - november 23 @entity58 ( a ) - november 26 @entity59 ( @entity60 ) - november 29 @entity61 ( a ) - december 2 @entity62 ( @entity60 ) - december 6 @entity63 ( @entity60 ) - december 9 @entity64 ( a ) - december 14 @entity65 ( a ) - december 17 @entity66 ( @entity60 ) - december 21 @entity67 ( a ) - december 26 @entity68 ( @entity60 ) - december 29 @entity61 ( @entity60 ) - january 1 after his form of the past two years , @entity0 has become integral to @entity6 's game plan but during that time we had the world 's third best player to cover his absence and there have been a lot : 13 since january 2013			1
four in his first six months , four last season , two over the summer and three thigh injuries this season			0
from a fan ’s perspective , it 's becoming more than frustrating ; do the coaching / fitness staff not know how to manage him properly , are they not up to the task ? having known his injury record is extensive though means the bigger issue at this stage is why had the club not prepared suitably over the summer ? @entity91 has n't done it			2
his @entity14 goals ratio is appalling and his work rate is awful			2
the concern with @entity8 is that , like @entity96 said , he 's the greatest myth in football			0
i was against his signing initially but got caught up in the hype , i admit , but what did @entity91 ever do to show he can become a top class striker ? on what we 've seen so far , his signing goes down as one of a long list of transfer failures in the past three years			0
@entity0 arrives at the side entrance of @entity6 's @entity110 on wednesday @entity91 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) are yet to score a @entity14 goal this season on the other hand , @entity11 has been thrown to the wolves , in how he 's been used , suggesting he was n't wanted in the first place			1
while @entity10 was all but being forced to move to @entity62			0
are we to believe the club were happy to start the season with @entity0 and @entity8 as our only first team strikers ? if that 's the case , you 've got to wonder what went on during those transfer committee meetings			1
of course , it 's unfair for us to simply blame @entity7			2
we all know he does n't have sole responsibility for identifying and signing players			0
but he is the face of the committee , as he is the club ’s manager , which means when something goes wrong all eyes turn to him			0
my biggest concern now is that our season could be over by the time we finally get to see @entity0 in a @entity6 shirt once again			1
but , of course , that also means that january will be a pivotal point for the club			0
summer mistakes must be rectified and we need to bring in not one , but two , top class , proven scorers			0
above - average simply wo n't do			0
the question is , with only a handful of @entity7 ’ signings proven to be good acquisitions , how much further will @entity147 be prepared to back him ? will he simply be told to make do ? it 's sad to say , but the next couple of months could very well define the rise or fall of @entity7			2
