by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 09:19 est , 27 august 2013 a paedophile who escaped jail after his 13 - year - old victim was called ' predatory ' in court will have his sentenced reviewed by the @entity6			2
@entity7 sparked outrage when he was handed a suspended sentence despite pleading guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child , making indecent images of a child and possession of an extreme pornographic image			1
now the attorney general has opted to refer the case to appeal judges who will decide whether the original sentence was unduly lenient			1
review : a paedophile who escaped prison will have his sentence re-examined at the @entity6 @entity7 , 41 , was given a 12 - month suspended sentence after prosecuting barrister @entity24 labelled his victims ' predatory ' and ' sexually experienced '			1
judge @entity27 also said he had accounted for the fact that the girl looked older than 13 when he sentenced @entity7			1
' having carefully reviewed this case , the attorney general , @entity31 qc mp , has decided to refer the sentence of @entity7 to the @entity6 for review , ' the attorney general 's office said in a statement			1
' the case will in due course be heard by three @entity6 judges who will decide whether or not the sentence is unduly lenient and whether they should increase it			2
' controversy : attorney general @entity31 , left , made the decision after barrister @entity24 , right , sparked an outcry by describing the man 's victim as ' predatory ' mr @entity24 has been suspended from prosecuting sexual offence cases pending a review by the @entity49 , while mr @entity51 ' comments are to be investigated by the @entity52			1
following the outcry over mr @entity24 's comments , 50,000 people signed a petition demanding that the @entity57 investigate the lawyer 's language			0
uproar : judge @entity51 imposed a more lenient sentence because the 13 - year - old girl looked older even @entity62 got involved in the controversy , saying : ' we need a criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims			1
the victims of crime should always be at the centre of our thinking			0
' @entity7 admitted to picking up the girl in the street in @entity73 , @entity74 while she was playing truant from school			2
he took her back to his flat and started a two - week ' fling ' with her , @entity77 heard , culminating in a sexual encounter apparently initiated by the girl			2
when officers went to @entity7 's home after the girl told a friend about the incident , they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer			2
during sentencing , mr @entity24 said : ' the girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced			0
' she appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15 year old despite being younger than that			0
' there was sexual activity but it was not of mr @entity7 's doing , you might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her			0
' the judge apparently agreed , telling @entity7 : ' i have taken in to account that even though the girl was 13 , the prosecution say she looked and behaved a little bit older			1
' you knew she was not nearly 16 as she said and your plea of guilty recognises that you knew			0
' allowing her to visit your home is something we have to clamp down on and in normal circumstances that would mean a significant term in prison			0
' on these facts , the girl was predatory and was egging you on			0
that is no defence when dealing with children but i am prepared to impose a suspension			0
