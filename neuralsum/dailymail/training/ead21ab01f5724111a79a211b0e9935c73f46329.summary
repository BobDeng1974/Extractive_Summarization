danger : @entity38 have been warned to stay away while the victim , who has not been named , undergoes further tests symptoms : @entity34 pamphlets on the virus describe its flu - like symptoms including headache , fever , muscle ache , shortness of breath and cough more than 10,000 tourists were warned to watch for symptoms			1

' this particular area , it 's an extreme case of rodent infestation			2
there 's evidence of rodents , mice , snakes , possums in and around the home , which is not unusual in a hoarding situation because there 's so much material			0
' it 's impossible to keep it clean and track the rodent population , ' said dr. @entity125 with the @entity126			0
@entity127 is a disease that 's carried by rodents , and when you go through processes like cleaning the home , sweeping , vacuuming , that sort of thing , it goes into the air			0
