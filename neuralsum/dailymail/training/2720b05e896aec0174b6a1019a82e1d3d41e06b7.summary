over the years , the @entity0 have often sought safety by fleeing over the @entity2 to @entity3			1
but a book by a @entity0 who has lived in @entity6 for 13 years complains that those in the @entity3 are unwelcoming and unfriendly towards them			1
author @entity9 says that not only is @entity10 expensive , the public services are inadequate and the natives look upon them mockingly			1
‘ the @entity10 does n’t really want to see us , ’ de @entity9 writes in @entity24 , la @entity26 et les @entity25 ( @entity27 , the @entity26 and the @entity28 )			2
‘ he has no desire to include us in his social universe			0
’ @entity31 , 35 , from a wealthy @entity33 family , has lived in @entity6 nearly half his life			0
he says it is fashionable for @entity0 residents to claim they have one or two @entity10 friends			2
but the so - called friend often turns out to be half @entity0 , married to a @entity0 person or someone fluent in the language			2
he claims a @entity0 bachelor in @entity6 is more likely to marry a @entity43 or a pole than a @entity45 , mr @entity9 , an executive in a private equity company , draws on his own experience having met his @entity0 wife in @entity6			1
his book , which appears in @entity0 shops this week , warns those intending to move to the @entity3 to expect mockery of their heavily accented @entity10 , which can prevent success in the business - world if you want to be taken seriously			1
‘ a banker can not afford to make his interlocutors laugh or even smile , ’ he writes			0
mr @entity9 said he thought of @entity6 as more like a @entity0 ' border town ' because of the number of @entity0 people living there mr @entity9 , who has two young children , also criticised how @entity10 people can not speak @entity66 properly			1
‘ they study @entity66 as though it were @entity68 , a dead language , ’ he writes			0
he complains that his surname is commonly mispronounced and is told his first name , @entity71 , sounds more like a girl ’s			0
the former banker comments on the @entity3 obsession with property , struck by how newspapers , he claims , are full of gratuitous references to the value of people ’s homes			1
he was surprised to be quizzed by a taxi driver about how much his property was worth			2
‘ i ca n’t imagine having a conversation like that with a taxi driver in @entity33 , ’ he said			0
however , he does acknowledge that @entity6 has become the capital of global finance — his main reason for being there — and describes it as the heart of the art world			0
he admits the restaurants are n’t as bad as the @entity66 may think and that fashion industry is getting better			0
but just as you thought he was giving the @entity3 the credit it may deserve , he claims much of @entity3 ’s success is based on the efforts of talented foreigners - many of them @entity0			1
a lot of @entity3 ’s top chefs were taught by @entity0 masters and many of the football stars in the @entity106 are @entity66 , he writes			1
he adds that living in @entity6 is more like a @entity0 ‘ border town ’ , given the volume of @entity0 people living there			1
@entity31 says it is common to hear @entity66 complain about how expensive @entity6 is and how the @entity111 does n’t live up to their own healthcare system – despite many still using it			0
but the father of two has no intentions of returning to his homeland and even told the @entity117 last week that he was thinking of putting his children into an @entity10 school			0
he has acceded to the property craze too , buying a home in ‘ little @entity0 ’ , otherwise known as @entity122 , west @entity6 .			2
