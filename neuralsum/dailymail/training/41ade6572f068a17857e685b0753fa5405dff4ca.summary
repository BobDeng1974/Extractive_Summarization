the @entity0 has released the first pictures of its own sniper battalion in what appears to be propaganda to answer the hit @entity6 film , @entity7			1
@entity8 as well as clean - shaven members of the eight - man unit are pictured posing with long - range @entity13 - made @entity12 sniper rifles in northern @entity14			1
adopting the look of an @entity6 sniper unit , the fighters are kitted out in khaki uniforms , peaked caps and ski goggles to protect them from the glare of the sun. according to the @entity6 - based jihadi tracking organisation , @entity24 , the unit is part of the @entity26 of northern @entity14			1
it is one of 16 administrative regions in the @entity0 that spans @entity30 and @entity14			1
an @entity47 sniper killed @entity54 revolutionary guard brigadier general @entity53 in december			1
@entity53 was one of a number of @entity54 advisers training @entity58 militias in their fight against @entity47			2
they have also played a prominent role in the battle for @entity63 which involved intense street fighting			0
@entity47 @entity66 accounts were quick to link the battalion to a famous @entity14 sniper who plagued @entity6 forces during the @entity14 conflict			1
one said the unit was carrying on the legacy of ' @entity73 ' , a @entity74 insurgent sniper who operated in @entity75 from 2005 where he is said to have killed around 40 @entity6 soldiers			1
the film @entity7 is directed by @entity78 and based on @entity80 's autobiography @entity6 sniper : the @entity81 in @entity82			1
with 255 kills , 160 of which were officially confirmed by the @entity85 , @entity80 is the deadliest marksman in @entity6 military history			2
but the film , which stars @entity88 and @entity89 , includes a character named @entity91 , shown as a rival to @entity88 's portrayal of @entity80 , undoubtedly based on @entity73			1
a shadowy figure , @entity73 claimed to be a soldier in the @entity74 insurgent @entity97 ( @entity97 ) - which included former members of @entity100 's @entity99 , his intelligence services and officers of the @entity103			1
armed and dangerous : @entity0 snipers have seen action in both @entity14 and @entity30 , where they have killed both @entity51 and @entity14 fighters his skills with a rifle reportedly allowed him to hit targets from 200 metres away			1
videos of @entity73 's exploits were seen at the time as an important step in the development of the insurgents ' propaganda and their ability to personalise the killing of coalition soldiers - a radical departure from earlier clips of the ied explosions and random car bombs that had been the hallmark of the insurgency			1
his videos also included direct threats and then - @entity6 president @entity128 , @entity128			2
' i have nine bullets in this gun and i have a present for @entity128 , ' @entity73 tells the camera in one video			0
' i am going to kill nine people			0
' in the close - quarter urban combat of @entity75 and @entity137 , exposed @entity6 soldiers were known to be highly vulnerable to sniper attacks and stories of a skilled marksman hunting them in the labyrinthine backstreets of @entity14 's cities took its toll on the @entity6 troops ' psyche			1
' he 's good , ' specialist @entity148 , a sniper based in @entity149 near @entity75 said in 2006			2
' every time we dismount , i 'm sure everyone has got him in the back of their minds			0
he 's a serious threat to us			0
' ' he definitely knows what to do with a rifle , ' major @entity157 , a retired @entity159 sniper instructor , told @entity162 in 2006			0
' he has the judgment and discipline to take a shot , wisely choose an escape route , and immediately depart to avoid capture			0
this is not a zealot ; this is a calculated shooter			0
' violent legacy : islamic state twitter accounts are linking the sniper battalion to a famous @entity14 sniper killer : one account said the unit was following in the footsteps of ' @entity73 , who reportedly killed around 40 @entity6 soldiers in @entity75 from 2005 big guns : @entity47 reportedly took possession of this giant 10 - foot - long sniper rifle last year			1
what sort of effect this gun would have is open to debate , claim experts he waited for soldiers to dismount or stand up in a @entity191 turret , before aiming for gaps in their body armour , the lower spine , ribs or above the chest			0
' the big concern is that there 's a school somewhere that 's ready to turn out more of these people , ' former @entity159 major @entity157 said in his 2006 @entity162 interview			0
debates about @entity73 's whereabouts or his existence continue to this day			2
the @entity206 announced in 2006 that it had captured an insurgent known as @entity208 ( aka @entity209 ) , claiming he was the famed ' @entity14 sniper '			2
many claim he may have not been an individual but a composite of various people , others say he may have been a figment of their imagination			0
' @entity73 ? he 's a product of the @entity6 military , ' captain @entity217 said in an interview with @entity221 in 2007			1
' we 've built up this myth ourselves			0
' as is often the case in the @entity226 , wild conspiracy theories went so far as to claim that @entity73 was an @entity228 agent trained by @entity229 as a propaganda tool			2
most experts agree that the death toll attributed to @entity73 ' is far - fetched , but his story continues to resonate today			2
last year @entity47 was reportedly took possession of a giant 10 - foot - long sniper rifle			1
it is so big that it has to be supported on two tripods and fires ammunition three times the size of standard rifle ammunition			0
an islamic state terrorist has been photographed aiming it out of a flat window in @entity245 , the scene of intense fighting between @entity242 and @entity51 forces			0
what sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate , however , according to firearms expert @entity253			0
retaliation : the ' sniper battalion ' pictures could be @entity0 's attempt to ramp up their own propaganda campaign following the release of the hit @entity6 film , @entity7 ( pictured ) , starring @entity88 @entity6 sniper : the film was based on the exploits of @entity80 ( pictured ) who was considered one of the deadliest shooter 's in @entity6 military history he told @entity269 : ' the problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we do n't know for sure what the calibre is , although there would n't be a lot of point in building something like this if it was n't of a significant calibre			1
' secondly , and probably of more importance , we do n't know how well it is made			0
is the barrel accurately machined and rifled ? ' the effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used			0
these rounds ( 23mm ) exist fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary @entity291 will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones			0
