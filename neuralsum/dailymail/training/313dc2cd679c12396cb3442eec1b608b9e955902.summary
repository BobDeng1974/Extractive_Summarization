sometimes it ’s easy to forget just how much of a presence humanity has in the solar system today			1
aside from the multitude of satellites in orbit around our own planet there are dozens of active and defunct spacecraft currently located all over the place			2
and in this fantastic graphic created by @entity13 they ’ve shown where almost all the active spacecraft in the solar system are , what they ’re doing and what their status is			1
scroll down for the full graphic @entity13 has created a graphic that showcases the various active spacecraft currently in the solar system			1
this ranges from @entity25 's messenger spacecraft , the first ever to orbit @entity26 , out to @entity28 , which is now the first and only manmade object ever to reach interstellar space the journey begins at @entity26 where @entity25 ’s messenger , currently the closest spacecraft to the sun , is in orbit			1
the @entity39 ( messenger ) probe arrived in august 2011 and is the first ever to orbit @entity26			1
since its arrival it has been returning unprecedented images and data about the solar system ’s innermost planet			1
@entity48 's @entity47 spacecraft , meanwhile , failed in an attempt to orbit @entity50 in 2010 - but it might be able to try again in 2015			1
moving further out to the second planet from the sun , @entity50 , we find @entity57 ’s @entity56			0
this spacecraft entered orbit on 11 april 2006 and has since been performing extensive studies of the @entity50 atmosphere			2
a few days ago @entity57 announced it would attempt a daring plunge into the planet ’s hostile atmosphere in june in a last - gasp attempt at further science as the spacecraft runs out of fuel – and it ’s likely @entity56 will not survive the ordeal			2
the busiest planet by some distance is @entity74 , which has been the subject of dozens of missions from various countries all over the world , starting with the @entity79 back in the 1960s			0
today there are three spacecraft in orbit , with two more joining later this year , and two active rovers on the surface : opportunity and @entity87 next on the scale we have five spacecraft that are currently observing the sun : @entity92 and @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
together , these spacecraft provide us not only with an opportunity to study the sun , but also with an early warning system that helps protect satellites when a solar flare erupts			2
at @entity103 the graphic does n’t detail the hundreds of satellites in our around our planet – there are simply too many – but instead focuses on @entity106			0
this is a defunct @entity25 satellite that will be making its way past @entity103 next week – and amateur rocketeers are gearing up to try and take control of the spacecraft as it swings by in june			2
at the moon , meanwhile , there are three orbiters : the twin @entity116 and @entity118 probes , which are measuring the effect of solar wind on the surface , and also the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , which amongst various tasks is studying future landing sites for manned missions			0
not shown is @entity128 ’s @entity127 3 lander , which landed on the surface in december 2013 and deployed a rover named @entity131 that unfortunately experienced a malfunction and is currently lying dormant on the surface			0
@entity74 is the busiest of the lot as various countries around the world clamour to understand more about the barren red planet that may hold clues about out future – or even our beginnings as we search for life on its surface			0
in orbit are @entity25 ’s hugely surrcessful @entity147 and @entity148 spacecraft , in tandem with @entity57 ’s equally impressive @entity151 mission			1
all have provided us with stunning imagery of the surface of @entity74 , and some have even caught glimpses of rovers we have sent to the surface such as @entity87			0
september of this year will see two new arrivals – @entity161 ’s first mission to the red planet , @entity163 , which is notable for being ‘ built on a shoestring budget			0
’ the other is @entity25 ’s @entity167 mission , an advanced vehicle that will study the @entity74 atmosphere in great detail			0
moving out still , in the asteroid belt we find the @entity174 spacecraft , which will become the first probe to visit the potentially water - harbouring dwarf planet @entity177 in february 2015			1
arguably the most successful spacecraft humanity has ever sent into the unknown is @entity180			0
it arrived at the @entity183 system in 2004 and has since provided us with unprecedented data and images about this fascinating place			0
in 2017 , however , the @entity180 mission will end with the spacecraft being sent to its destruction in @entity183 , with no additional mission to @entity183 yet in the works towards @entity194 , meanwhile , @entity57 ’s @entity193 spacecraft is just weeks away from rendezvousing with comet @entity195 and will enter orbit later this year – the first spacecraft ever to do so			2
@entity194 is currently devoid of any human presence but will be greeted by @entity25 ’s solar - powered juno in july 2016 , the furthest a spacecraft will ever have operated on solar power alone			1
around @entity183 is found one of the most successful spacecraft to date - @entity180 - which has furthered our understanding of @entity183 arguably more so than any probe around any planet			0
@entity180 has studied @entity183 ’s fascinating moons , including sending the probe @entity210 to the surface of @entity213 in 2005 , and has revealed many secrets of the @entity183 system			0
the next spacecraft of note is @entity217 - on 14 july 2015 it will become the first manmade object ever to visit the icy world @entity220			2
and , finally , the last two active spacecraft are @entity25 ’s @entity28 and 2 probes - both of these are on their way out of the solar system , although only the former is so far technically in interstellar space .			1

website outer places have created a graphic showing the location of all active probes in the solar system
these range from @entity25 's messenger spacecraft , currently in orbit around @entity26 , to the @entity28 probes
the graphic shows just how busy with human presence our solar system really is - although some planets are not
@entity246 and @entity247 , for example , have only ever been *briefly* visited by @entity248 on its way out of the system
and some yet - to - be explored places , such as @entity177 and @entity220 , will finally get their first human visitors next year
