by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 07:37 est , 22 may 2012 unassuming : @entity2 's neighbours knew her as a guest house landlady whose greatest pleasure was walking her @entity5 , @entity6 to her neighbours @entity2 was a pleasant middle - aged woman who liked walking her @entity5 around their sleepy seaside town			1
so when the unassuming landlady of @entity12 in the @entity13 was suddenly arrested in 1940 on suspicion of being a @entity15 spy , few believed it possible			1
@entity2 's husband had been sent to @entity21 to aid the fire service , the couple 's guest house in @entity19 had been closed and @entity2 was left to her own devices			1
the @entity24 was flooded with soldiers , military bases and equipment			2
the neighbours thought @entity2 wandered with dog @entity6 to stave off the loneliness but the police had their suspicions			1
they believed @entity2 's dog walks were just a ruse , that in fact she was gathering intelligence into restricted military areas			1
she was accused of making detailed maps , cutting military telephone wires and wearing a small swastika badge on the underside of her coat lapel			1
she was tried and convicted in @entity45 of betraying her country and became the first @entity48 woman to be sentenced to death for treason			1
she escaped the gallows after her lawyer successfully won an appeal for misdirection of the jury			1
instead , she was jailed for 14 years			1
but tantalizingly , @entity2 's story does not end there			1
on her release in 1950 she went straight to @entity59 insisting her ' spying ' activities were a bit of fun or a ' lark ' , as she put it , which got rather out of hand			1
shock : but in 1940 @entity2 was charged with being a @entity15 spy and sentenced to death			1
this mugshot is from 1918 after she was arrested for forging bank notes why ? an extract from @entity2 's detailed map of the @entity13 's eastern coastline in 1940 shows she concentrated on the defences in and around @entity76 , an area initially earmarked for invasion by @entity78 she told the @entity79 that ' the whole thing was a joke ' , and that she ' looked forward to the trial as an immense thrill '			1
she said : ' the excitement of being tried for my life was intense ... it made me feel somebody instead of being an ordinary seaside landlady			2
' @entity2 died aged 83 in 1985 and her version of events was generally accepted until 1995			1
then her prosecution papers were released and it became plain just how serious a threat she constituted to national security in 1940			2
landlady : pictured last year , this is @entity12 , in @entity19 , @entity2 's guest house home at the time of her arrest in 1940			1
she escaped the gallows and was sentenced to 14 years in prison but returned to the villa on her release in 1950 familiar : @entity2 was twice jailed at @entity105 , once for borstal training and then in 1941 to serve her wartime crimes sentence			1
on her second visit the prison psychologist found her to be highly disturbed the papers said the maps she drew were ' terrifyingly accurate ' , and ' would be of very great importance to the enemy '			1
@entity13 mp @entity114 had championed her cause , but was shocked when the papers were released			1
he said : ' i set out to clear her name , but i am staggered by the treachery she sunk to			2
she could have altered the direction of the war			2
' but the notion of ' @entity123 being just another unhinged fantasist persisted			0
now book , @entity125 , based on hitherto unseen reports unearthed by author @entity127 has shed new light on the mystery			1
keeping watch : @entity2 had made notes on troop movements on the island , including the use of bicycles by the 6th @entity137 key area : after war broke out , the @entity13 became a key defensive position and thousands of troops were stationed there using research by the @entity145 journalist @entity144 , mr @entity127 began digging into @entity2 's past and uncovered documents that , more than any other , offer the most likely explanation of who mrs @entity2 really was			1
she had enjoyed a comfortable childhood with her adoptive parents , a @entity153 official and his wife , in @entity155 , south @entity21			0
that all ended before her eleventh birthday when her mother died and father married his vindictive housekeeper , who bullied the young @entity123			0
in 1918 after a spell in a home for young girls training for a life of domestic service , she was in trouble and well known as a ' thoroughly bad lot '			0
that year she was sent to borstal after forging banks notes and in 1920 served two years ' hard labour for stealing clothes from her employer in @entity172			2
timings : this official photograph was taken at @entity175 on 24 august 1940 as @entity2 was compiling maps and drawing sketches of the @entity13 's coastal defences important : @entity175 's 9.2in guns were an important component in the defence of the island			1
@entity2 noted their presence on her maps spying : in post-war interviews it was clear @entity2 had also been keeping an eye on the nearest of four @entity190 sea forts at @entity191 was she working for @entity192 ? when she was arrested by troops on the island , @entity2 had a swastika badge on the underside of her coat lapel on her return to @entity21 some years later , @entity2 gathered a collection of convictions for prostitution			1
the fourth saw her locked up in @entity202 for three weeks			0
on her release she married @entity204 , a @entity21 fireman 19 years her senior			2
and on his retirement the couple moved to the @entity13 , but when war broke out in 1939 he was put back into service and she was left alone			1
the soldiers stationed on the island had at first thought the then 42 - year - old @entity2 , who was always hanging around with her dog , was just a nuisance			1
this map of the @entity13 in 1940 , shows @entity215 ’s close proximity to military installations @entity217 1			2

@entity242 icon – @entity273 , @entity274 ( @entity215 arrest site ) but their suspicions were aroused when she offered a squaddie , tired of her interference , the tidy sum of 10 shillings as a bribe and was found to be wearing the swastika			2
she was booked , and ordered to appear before @entity284 , a hearing which she did n't turn up for			0
then , when police arrived at her villa they found it locked			0
@entity2 had gone on the run			2
it took three weeks to track her down			0
in that time she had made more maps , cut phone wires , and , unusually for an undercover agent , offered schoolboys small bribes to tell her about army gun emplacements			2
her previous convictions for prostitution and fraud came out in the subsequent trial and this , it was later suggested , was the reason she had gone on the run , fearing her husband would find out			0
@entity2 was subject to psychological testing at @entity105 , where she served the majority of her sentence			2
and the reports into her mental health by the prison governor and psychologist , unearthed by mr @entity127 using the @entity314 , give the most likely explanation of her so - called spying activities			1
difficult childhood : the young @entity2 almost certainly received her truncated convent schooling at @entity319 of @entity320 in @entity21 but by 1918 she was well known as a ' thoroughly bad lot ' criminal career : as well as the conviction for forgery , @entity2 also racked up convictions for stealing clothes and prostitution before being sentenced to death for treason death : @entity2 died aged 83 in 1985			1
this photograph was taken four years before her death while she was living in sheltered housing at @entity333 , on the @entity13 the @entity125 by by @entity127 is published on thursday according to the governor , @entity2 appeared to be a highly disturbed , and highly intelligent woman with a deep grudge against authority			1
the reports made clear she regularly self - harmed , and had ' attacks ... in which she has to " obey people " inside her who encourage her to do harmful acts to herself '			2
she had enacted a pretend hanging by placing a chair on her cell bed , and sometimes slept naked under the bed			0
they also noted a sexual dimension to her behaviour , which included tying herself in awkward positions for hours at a time			0
the prison medical officer dr @entity352 reported that @entity2 inserted an alarming collection of objects into her vagina			1
these included a light bulb , more than 50 pieces of broken glass , a small pot , and 100 pins			0
in the fascinating book of the story that has remained a mystery for more than 70 years , mr @entity127 believes this evidence shows @entity2 was not a spy but a woman who sought the limelight			1
but , while there is no evidence she ever attempted to communicate her information to anyone in any way , it is not impossible that she was hedging her bets , calculating , perhaps , that if the @entity376 invaded , she would be able to prove her loyalty to the new cause			0

@entity385 thought @entity2 was pleasant guest house landlady who liked walking her dog
shocked when she was charged with being @entity15 spy and sentenced to death
@entity2 escaped gallows and spent 14 years in prison
she said her ' spying ' antics had been a ' lark ' which got out of hand
but @entity2 drew detailed maps and recorded troops ' activities on the @entity13
