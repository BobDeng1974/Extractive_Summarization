mr @entity0 ' disappointed ' at decision and claims there is no ' conflict ' between his role as a magistrate and manager of a club by @entity8 published : 09:00 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 20:45 est , 29 october 2012 magistrate by day : @entity10 @entity0 applied for a licence to open a strip club as one of the country ’s youngest magistrates , @entity0 is committed to keeping the peace			1
however , he ’s causing something of a brouhaha in his other role … as the manager of a string of strip clubs			2
the 34 - year - old ’s double life came to light after he applied to open a fully nude lap dancing club in @entity27			1
the proposal was rejected by the local council but not before it caused a storm of protest among residents , some of whom questioned the wisdom of having a magistrate involved in the sex industry			2
mr @entity0 was only 28 when he was sworn in as a @entity10 for @entity38 , @entity39 , in 2007			1
then , he said he worked in the leisure industry for a national company			0
now , however , he is involved in a less salubrious business			0
he works as operations manager for the @entity44 which owns strip clubs and runs a number of venues including @entity48 – a @entity50 - themed lap dancing bar			2
his proposal for @entity27 – which involved the setting up of a club with private booths and nude pole dancing – attracted more than 120 letters of objection			2
speaking at a council meeting which later threw out the plan , mother - of - two @entity58 said : ‘ i do n’t want my children to grow up thinking that the sex industry in @entity27 is all right			0
‘ by allowing sex establishments in the town , you as a council are telling our children it ’s all right , and it ’s not all right			0
’ in support of his club plan , mr @entity0 said : ‘ we ’re not here to discuss moral concerns			1
’ rejections : more than 100 residents complained about the application for a fully nude lap - dancing club when asked after the meeting if he used the services on offer at his establishments , he said : ‘ not really			1
i go and visit other venues – you become a bit anaesthetised to it after time			0
’ he also defended his dual role , saying , ‘ it ’s important in law that you have a broad spectrum of life experience – and that ’s why you sit on a panel of three ( magistrates )			0
’ mr @entity0 , who is married , said that evidence showed sex entertainment venues attracted less antisocial behaviour and crime than regular nightclubs			1
he said the sex club – to be open seven days a week until 6am – was planned for the upper floor of a larger nightclub and would not be advertised outside			0
he later said he was ‘ disappointed ’ with the decision to reject the club plan , adding : ‘ i feel our application has been misunderstood by the public , press and the council			2
’ his company is considering whether to appeal			0
local @entity110 , 42 , said : ‘ it ’s a bit odd that a magistrate was behind plans to open a strip club			1
you would n’t really put those two jobs together – there ’s enough sleaze around without having it in your face in the town centre			0
’ full time operation : the strip club would have contained several private booths and remained open until 6am every day ( picture posed by model )			1
