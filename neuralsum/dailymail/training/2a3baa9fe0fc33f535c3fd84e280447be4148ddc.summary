it was the most predictable and the most unpredictable of starts for @entity2			1
he caused havoc in his first 45 mintues , creating a goal for @entity7 and what should have been a goal for @entity10 but was the only one of @entity13 ’s front there not to pick up an early booking			2
back from his four month ban for biting @entity19 the @entity17 striker kept himself out of trouble in the first half but was a constant thorn in @entity23 and @entity24 ’ side			1
it was his pass that set up @entity7 for the first goal			0
having started on the right he played in the @entity30 who still had plenty to do and did it well to give @entity13 the lead			2
videos scroll down to watch former @entity35 striker @entity2 is tackled by @entity36 as @entity37 ( centre ) and @entity24 ( right ) look on @entity2 was a constant thorn in the side of the @entity42 defence and caused havoc on his @entity13 debut @entity2 celebrates after assisting @entity7 just three minutes into his @entity13 debut since his summer move he held the ball up well with his back to goal and aside from one loose pass to @entity50 his distribution was good			1
but @entity13 have bought him for his ability to unsettle opposition defenders and that is what he did throughout his first 45 minutes back in action			2
concerns had been aired pre-match that he would not be fit enough to play the biggest fixture in @entity60 football but at times in the first half it had appeared it was @entity23 and @entity24 who looked as if they had spent the last four months kicking their heels and not @entity2			2
he should have had assist number two when he set up @entity10 with an even better cross from the right but the @entity70 forward inexplicable failed to accept the gift			0
the game turned on that miss. @entity2 loses the ball to @entity42 defender @entity24 as @entity13 lost 3 - 1 to their fierce @entity75 rivals @entity2 creates a diversion as @entity13 's @entity7 moves forward with the ball as @entity78 watches on @entity2 appears to gesture to the referee as @entity24 and @entity78 keep a close eye on the frontman he went into one crunching challenge with @entity36 that left him hobbling for the next five minutes feeling his right knee but came out for the second half going down under another challenge this time from @entity87 that earned @entity13 a free - kick on the edge of the area			1
@entity2 is a fair way down the pecking order and @entity50 wasted the kick much to the former @entity35 striker ’s frustration			1
@entity2 was still full of running in the second half and released @entity7 as @entity13 tried to hit back straight away			1
with a lung busting run he made it into the area for the return pass but the referee penalised him for a foul on @entity24 as he lost and regained the ball from the @entity106 defender			0
it was one of those fouls that probably would not have been given in the @entity109 and the reaction summed up that frustration throwing his arms up at referee @entity113			0
if @entity114 had decided to take @entity2 off on the hour he changed his mind with his first 15 minutes of the second half			0
he should have been awarded a foul after @entity24 pulled him back between the half way line and the penalty area			0
he grew increasingly frustrated as @entity42 ’s third goal went in			0
there were others who looked to have tired more in the second half but his number nine finally came up on 70 minutes			0
there had been no dream comeback but @entity13 fans disappointed at the heavy defeat can take much encouragement from the debut .			1

@entity2 loses 3 - 1 to @entity42 on @entity13 debut
@entity17 impressed in first game for @entity134 *giants* since summer switch
former @entity35 striker was a constant threat throughout
