he first made a false claim saying his pet cat had been involved in a road accident			0
all the claims were in his name and he gave his address and bank details			2
in mitigation his barrister argued @entity10 had carried out the frauds to pay off a £ 200,000 debt run up after his marriage to his first wife collapsed and his bid to buy a vet surgery failed			1
he claimed @entity10 had become addicted to clearing his debts but when he was arrested the vet owed just £ 21,000			1
however back in his native @entity21 it emerged he had conviction for burglary and obtaining property by deception			1
sentencing him at the @entity31 today , judge @entity70 said @entity10 was a man who ' not willing to curtail his expenditure to come in line with his means ' which resulted in him racking up debts			1
she said : ' this was a course of behaviour which happened over three years and involved at least 50 separate acts of dishonesty			0
' you attempted to gain £ 226,000 when actually you obtained £ 198,000			2
' in 2009 you took out pet insurance for your cat			0
you then said she was in a car accident and you made claims for her medical treatment			0
' you made up more and more cats , each suffering from fictitious illnesses or injuries			0
he used an official stamp and template from his employer @entity40 in @entity41 to make 54 claims against insurers ' you were abusing your position of trust ( at the vet surgery ) and the extent of that abuse only became clear after your arrest			1
' you were using their headed paper , stamp and template and even took them with you when you left the surgery so you could continue your fraudulent activity thereafter			1
' you used your knowledge as a vet to deceive the insurance companies			0
' i accept that you had debts			0
i do not accept this is the whole truth of the matter			0
his barrister argued @entity10 had carried out the frauds to pay off a £ 200,000 debt ' you came over from @entity21 in 2001			1
you over extended yourself and got in debt			0
' the picture of the years that follow is frankly the behaviour of a man who is not willing to curtail his expenditure to come in line with his means			0
' as for your remorse , i am far from convinced of that			0
' it seems to me mr @entity10 that you have fooled yourself as much as other people about the person you really are			1
' judge @entity132 also called for the destruction of the stamp and template which @entity10 used to create the fake insurance claims			1
confiscation proceedings against @entity10 have begun			1
@entity138 , defending @entity10 , said his client had nothing to hand over			1

speaking after the sentencing , ds @entity149 , who ran the @entity152 ’s @entity151 ( @entity151 ) investigation , said : ' @entity10 was paid a good salary to help sick animals , but over three years he systematically abused his position to claim massive payouts for surgeries on pets that did not exist			2
' his sole motivation was to maintain an image of being a successful vet through the portrayal of an extravagant lifestyle			0
' @entity10 ’s sentence highlights again how @entity151 is working with industry to bring insurance fraudsters to justice wherever they are and whatever they do			2
' a @entity147 spokesperson said : ' we have been liaising with @entity151 about this case for some time			0
' now that a conviction against @entity10 has been secured and sentence handed down , we will raise an allegation against him and invite him to respond			2
' the case , as a conviction , will then be passed immediately to our @entity177 , which will be able to consider the details of the case and decide the most appropriate course of action			0
