by @entity0 a potentially deadly @entity2 superbug has been found in @entity4 milk for the first time			1
the superbug – already a problem in farm animals on the @entity9 – can cause serious and occasionally deadly infections in humans and is becoming a cause of udder infections in dairy cows			1
the strain of @entity2 known as @entity16 is resistant to antibiotics , so doctors find it difficult to treat infected people effectively			2
superbug : a strain of @entity2 has been found in @entity4 milk for the first time in theory the bug should be killed off when milk is heat - treated in the pasteurisation process before it reaches the high street or doorstep			1
however , some people prefer unpasteurised milk and cheese in the belief it is better for them or tastes nicer			1
and farmers , vets and abattoir workers who come into contact with the cows and their calves can become infected , allowing the bug to spread into the wider community			0
that has happened in the @entity44 where the same strain of @entity2 has caused illness among nursing home residents			1
@entity48 was first seen in pigs in @entity50 in 2003			1
it has since become epidemic in @entity54 and @entity55 pig populations and has spread to poultry and cattle			0
it is one of a number of superbugs that have emerged in recent years , apparently as a result of the overuse of antibiotics by farmers treating sick animals			0
over time the farm animal bugs develop a resistance			0
strain : farmers , vets and abbatoir workers who come into contact with cows and their calves can become infected the @entity76 , which campaigns for organic farming , is calling for a government investigation to establish the spread of the mrsa and a crackdown on the use of antibiotics on @entity4 farms			1
scientists from the department of veterinary medicine at the @entity87 tested 1,500 samples of bulk milk and found seven cases of @entity48 from five farms in @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
they said the high level of antibiotic resistance in the bug means the findings are ‘ of significance to both veterinary and human health ’			0
dr @entity101 , a senior lecturer in preventive veterinary medicine , said the discovery was made while looking for a different strain of @entity2 found in cows and people			2
he said : ‘ until this discovery it was always assumed that this form of livestock mrsa was a problem on the @entity9 , but it has now jumped the @entity112			0
it now seems that it is established in this country – perhaps one in every 200 farms			2
‘ if it ends up becoming more commonplace it will , sooner or later , cause disease in people here			0
’ dr @entity101 said the major question is why @entity2 is appearing in farm animals and whether this is linked to intensive farming and the associated heavy use of antibiotics			0
he asked : ‘ should we be thinking again about the type and range of antibiotics we use in farm animals ? is it wise to have a lot of preventive use of antibiotics , particularly in dairy cows ? ‘ they get a lot of mastitis – udder infection – because they are driven hard to produce a lot of milk , which is the only way farmers can make money			2
‘ i think you have to look at the pressures the supermarkets create by screwing the farmers down so tightly on costs			0
