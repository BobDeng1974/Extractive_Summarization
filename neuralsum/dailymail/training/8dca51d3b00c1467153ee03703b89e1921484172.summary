@entity1 's refusal to guarantee @entity2 a place in his @entity4 was a significant factor in @entity7 ’s failed bid to sign the @entity9 star ahead of next year ’s @entity10			1
@entity7 head coach @entity11 admitted on thursday the deal was ‘ dead in the water ’ with @entity13 unwilling to help fund the £ 240,000 transfer fee demanded by the @entity16 giants			2
but it has emerged that @entity1 told @entity2 ’s advisors that the depth of back - row talent available to him in @entity22 meant he was unable to provide assurances the 29 - year - old would be included in the 33 - man eps squad which he announces this wednesday			1
@entity2 's move to @entity7 is dead in the water meaning he will not be in the @entity22 squad @entity1 did not give @entity2 any guarantees ' @entity2 wanted to firm assurance that he would be named in the eps but there was no way @entity35 could give that , ' an @entity22 insider told @entity37			1
@entity39 flanker @entity38 is expected to be named alongside captain @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 on wednesday – with strict @entity13 selection criterion meaning only @entity45 - based players can be selected - with @entity49 centre @entity47 ’ place in serious doubt			1
@entity7 ’s uncapped @entity52 - born winger @entity51 – who only signed professional papers two years ago and still a serving soldier in the @entity55 – is also in line to be named in @entity58 ’s 33 - man squad			1
@entity38 ’s inclusion would raise most eyebrows , two years after he was banned for 32 weeks for breaking the arm of @entity63 hooker @entity62			0
@entity1 – who coached @entity38 as a youngster at the @entity65 - has made several attempts to blood the uncapped 25 - year - old , only to be thwarted by suspension and injuries , but @entity70 understands he is in line to be named this wednesday			2
@entity73 flanker @entity72 is understood to have edged ahead of @entity49 ’s @entity74 and is being seriously considered , while @entity42 – who this week signed a lucrative new contract at @entity76 – will also be included alongside no 8s @entity77 and @entity79			1
@entity83 ' @entity82 form has been patchy so far this season and with @entity86 @entity85 in sensational form and highly - rated @entity73 inside centre @entity88 fit again and apparently certain to be included , the 25 - year - old @entity49 centre faces an anxious wait			2
@entity58 has yet to settle on his favoured wing combination and @entity51 – a tank driver with the @entity94 who completed a six - month tour of the notorious @entity96 in @entity97 as an infantryman in 2007 – has made an irresistible case for inclusion			0
@entity73 flanker @entity72 looks set to be named in the @entity101 ‘ the way i see it , i want to make every opportunity count and take every single opportunity that comes my way , ’ the 27 - year - old told @entity103 this week			1
‘ when you experience something like ( @entity97 ) that it teaches you a lesson in life			0
that ’s how i ’m looking at my professional rugby career			0
i have one go at this and i do n’t intend to mess it up			0
’ @entity119 is certain to be included as one winger – despite taking time to settle at his new club @entity121 this season – but with @entity124 ’s @entity123 not fully fit and @entity125 may yet to convince at the highest level , @entity58 ’s wing options remain relatively thin			0
@entity73 experienced flyer @entity127 could yet make the final cut			2
@entity130 has established himself as @entity22 ’s first - choice scrum half ahead of next year ’s @entity10 and will be one of three scrum - halves named along with @entity134 and @entity135			2
@entity130 looks set to be @entity22 's first choice scrum half in the build up to the @entity10 fly half @entity137 looks set to be among the most unfortunate to miss out			1
the 26 - year - old made his first @entity22 appearance in almost six years this summer and has been in superb form for @entity142 this season			0
but with @entity144 and @entity145 assured of inclusion , and @entity149 ’s consistency admired by the @entity22 management , it would take a significant about - turn for the in - form @entity137 to be included			1
@entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 will be three of the locks with @entity156 set to be named in the eps but unlikely to feature this autumn after a string of concussions for @entity63			0
@entity39 ’s @entity160 , @entity73 @entity161 and @entity63 ’s @entity162 are vying for the final second - row spots			0
@entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 will be the props with @entity169 and @entity170 at certain to be named as hooker with @entity173 favourite to be named as the third no 2			0
@entity73 @entity175 and @entity39 's @entity135 are battling for the third scrum - half spot			1
long - term injured @entity182 ( neck ) , @entity185 ( shoulder ) , @entity156 ( concussion ) , @entity178 ( shoulder ) and @entity180 ( knee ) are expected to be named in the eps but will not feature any of the four @entity188 internationals this november .			0

@entity2 's move to @entity7 collapsed after lack of @entity22 guarantees from @entity1
@entity73 flanker @entity72 likely to be called up to @entity22 squad
@entity137 expected to miss out on a place in the @entity4
