@entity1 cast - off @entity0 gave @entity3 's selectors a reminder of his talents with a big - hitting half - century on his @entity7 debut for @entity8			1
@entity0 , left out of @entity3 's final 15 for the impending global tournament in @entity10 and @entity11 after an unproductive 2014 , could still be a late inclusion as a replacement should injury befall any squad member			2
arriving only as an injury replacement too for the @entity8 , following @entity18 's defection , the 23 - year - old wasted no time confirming his liking for @entity10 conditions			0
@entity0 smashes 77 from 37 balls in his @entity8 debut in @entity10 's @entity7 no part of @entity25 's @entity24 was safe as @entity0 demolished the @entity27 ' attack @entity0 ( 77 ) , the one shining light of @entity3 's miserable @entity31 tour last winter , smashed eight fours and five sixes from just 37 balls in the @entity8 ' much - needed 37 - run win over @entity27 at the @entity24			1
former @entity3 captains @entity36 and @entity38 were predictably on cue with their views on @entity41			0

' @entity38 , also left out of @entity3 's plans after his sacking 11 months ago , was another to remind the selectors of his talents this week with a @entity7 half - century			1
he tweeted : ' @ benstokes38 is a star in the making			0
he 's showing it this eve ! good on him ! i can not for the life of me believe he 's not in @entity1			0
' @entity0 , who was left out of @entity3 's 15 - man squad for the tri-series and @entity1 , hits another big one @entity27 captain @entity68 takes the catch that finally dismisses @entity0 @entity0 was a near ever - present , when fit , for @entity3 last year but mustered a limited - overs output of only 200 runs and 14 wickets in 17 matches across the two formats			1
after his continued poor form in the one - day international series defeat in @entity77 , he ended that tour out of the team and was then not chosen shortly afterwards in @entity3 's @entity1 squad			2
there was no cheer for @entity3 , who arrive in @entity10 on wednesday in time their @entity85 tri-series , when @entity86 - in his last @entity7 appearance before joining up with them - could make only seven as the @entity27 faltered to 126 all out in reply to 163 for seven .			0
