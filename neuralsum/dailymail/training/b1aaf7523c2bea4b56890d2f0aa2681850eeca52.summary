by @entity0 @entity1 was in turmoil last night as members of the @entity6 , party donors and businessmen united to condemn @entity8 ’s plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p			1
insiders said the @entity12 has left @entity14 ’s top team divided over the wisdom of ramping up tax after refusing to consult his senior colleagues about @entity1 ’s biggest economic announcement in a year			1
former @entity20 minister @entity19 accused mr @entity8 of using ‘ gcse economics ’ to justify a return to the ‘ politics of envy ’ , while other critics said the move would deter investors from coming to @entity28 and damage economic growth			1
division : former @entity1 ministers accused @entity8 of employing ' gcse economics ' to device his latest tax policy with his credibility under fire , mr @entity8 then used an interview yesterday to deny that the deficit left by @entity1 was a problem			1
he even boasted that if he had his time in power again he would have spent even more money in some areas			0
and he refused to say what blend of spending cuts and tax rises he would adopt to balance the books – raising the spectre of further tax raids on middle @entity52			2
in a speech to the left - wing @entity54 on saturday , mr @entity8 revealed that @entity1 will increase the income tax rate from 45p in the pound to 50p for those earning over £ 150,000 until 2020 if the party wins power next year			1
he also said @entity1 would eliminate the deficit by 2020 – two years slower than @entity62 has planned			1
a senior @entity1 figure told the @entity64 that mr @entity8 sprung the plans on the @entity6 last week and also revealed that several shadow ministers think the decision is a mistake			1
‘ it was n’t discussed with us , ’ a member of the @entity6 said			0
‘ we were told in advance but we did n’t get to have a say			0
frankly we ’re pretty divided over whether it is a good idea			0
there is no unity on that			0
’ controversial : @entity8 made the tax pledge in a speech on saturday to the @entity54 in his speech , mr @entity8 claimed that the plan could bring in £ 15billion over five years			1
but @entity83 figures , backed up by the independent @entity84 and the respected @entity85 , show that cutting the top rate is only set to cost the government £ 100million			0
in an interview with the @entity90 ’s @entity89 yesterday , mr @entity8 admitted that he has no idea how much money the tax rise will bring in			1
‘ the question is how much , ’ he said			0
the plans were roundly denounced by two of @entity98 ’s ministers			2
@entity19 said : ‘ the economic logic behind his thinking would not get him a pass at gcse economics			1
@entity8 takes us back to old @entity1 and the politics of envy			1
we need to encourage productive enterprise and effort rather than resort to predatory taxation			0
’ @entity19 ( @entity111 ) @entity110 , a former trade minister who now sits as a crossbench peer , accused @entity1 of devising an ‘ if it creates wealth let ’s kick it ’ policy			1
he predicted mr @entity8 would ramp the top rate even higher , to 55p or 60p , if he gets his hands on power – a claim mr @entity8 denies			1
those questioning the move yesterday included @entity121 , chief executive of the @entity122 , who warned that the swingeing tax rate could deter foreign investors from coming to the @entity28			1
@entity1 left @entity28 with a deficit 5.3 per cent of gdp at the start of the financial crisis – the highest in the @entity129 group of the world ’s biggest economies			1
but mr @entity8 told the @entity132 : ‘ do i think the level of public spending going into the crisis was a problem for @entity28 ? no , i do n’t			1
’ @entity137 , financial secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ @entity1 got us into a mess by spending and borrowing too much in the good years			1
‘ but @entity8 thinks the deficit was not “ too high ” at the time , and says he would do it all over again			1
it ’s the same old @entity1			2
’ should we need confirmation that @entity1 was returning to type as the party of high taxes and state intervention in business we now have it			2
the pledge by @entity8 to lift the tax paid by the very highest earners to 50 pence in the pound looks like a return to the bad old @entity1 of the 1970s when chancellor @entity153 vowed to tax the rich until ‘ the pips squeak ’			1
until saturday , when the burly shadow chancellor unveiled his new script , the @entity20 and the business community had drawn a distinction between ‘ @entity160 ’ and ‘ @entity161 ’			1
@entity162 was @entity14 , with his hugely damaging threats of intervention in the markets – starting off with his promise to freeze energy prices – undermining not only the energy sector but banking , house - building and out - sourcing companies as well as the safety of the @entity173 as a place to invest			0
believe it or not , @entity175 was balls , who from his days in the @entity179 government had bought into the @entity181 economic model of free markets , low taxation and soft - touch regulation of the financial community			0
clearly , though , @entity1 now feels so desperate to develop a winning narrative in the face of the stupendous gains in employment over recent months and the @entity191 ’s endorsement of the @entity28 recovery that it has decided to play the class card			2
by seeking to revive the 50 per cent tax band for people earning over £ 150,000 a year , it is endeavouring to portray the @entity197 as the party of the rich			0
in so doing it has abandoned @entity200 and @entity202 ’s famous dictum that he was ‘ intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich ’			0
only in the dying days of the 1997 - 2010 @entity1 government did the party increase taxes on higher earners in a revenge attack on the perceived role of the bankers in bringing the financial system crashing down			2
until then @entity1 had been more than happy to keep a top rate of 40 per cent – less than the 45 per cent introduced by @entity62 – for almost its whole period in office			2
the biggest criticism of the high taxation of big earners is that it stifles entrepreneurship and drives the most talented individuals overseas			0
top executives at some of our most successful exporters , such as drinks giant @entity223 , have told me that many of their best managers sought overseas postings because @entity228 introduced the 50 per cent rate as chancellor under @entity98			0
britons do not have to look far to see the sheer economic vandalism caused by high taxes			0
long before president @entity235 of @entity237 ’s love life became the story , he was in deep trouble because of his decision to introduce tax rates for the most wealthy of up to 80 per cent			0
entrepreneurship ground to a halt , the economy stuttered and there was an exodus of executives to @entity248			0
it is an inexorable law of economics that the lower the tax rate , the more the income that is generated for a country			2
high taxes act as a disincentive to hard work and business creativity			0
figures from @entity259 ( @entity259 ) show that the @entity260 will raise £ 49.3billion from the 45 per cent tax rate this year , against £ 41.6billion in 2012 - 2013 when the 50 per cent rate was in place			2
this is partly because the higher the tax level , the more those earning the highest incomes look for ways to avoid paying tax			0
the dangerous aspect of the schoolboy economics of the two @entity272 is that it damages the very people they claim to represent			0
by aiming an arrow at the heart of enterprise they damage economic confidence and the willingness of business people – from the smallest corner shop to the big corporations – to invest and to create jobs			0
@entity1 appears set on a path of wanton economic and financial destruction that undermines growth and the value of all our savings in pensions and @entity294			2
the very idea that any of this can end the pressure on living standards – a consequence of the mess @entity1 left behind – is sheer , unadulterated fantasy .			2

shadow chancellor **'s** plans to raise tax caused rifts in @entity1 , say insiders
@entity8 has been criticised for using ' gcse economics ' by former minister
yesterday mr @entity8 even denied that @entity1 **'s** deficit was a problem
