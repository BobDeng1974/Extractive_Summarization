by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 click here to sign up for @entity3 and start managing your team ahead of the new @entity7 season , which begins on august 16			2
as part of the build - up to the start of @entity3 's @entity3 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity7 with the potential to light up @entity16 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity18 in a nutshell @entity18 is a 24 - year - old @entity20 international who can play as an attacking midfielder , winger or wide forward			1
he has signed for @entity23 from @entity24 outfit @entity25 , where he scored 28 times in 115 matches , in order to provide some much needed creativity to @entity33 's side			1
at £ 12million , he has become @entity23 's most expensive signing in nine years but he looks good value for money as @entity33 looks to strengthen a squad which struggled last season			1
he also provided five assists for his team - mates over the course of the league campaign and received an impressive nine @entity59 awards , while having 2.7 shots per match			0
his pass success rate - at 79.8 % - was quite high for an attacking midfielder best known for his trickery and ability to get to the byline and cross the ball in			1
( stats courtesy of @entity69 ) why you should have @entity71 in your @entity72 points are what @entity3 is all about - and @entity18 should provide them in abundance on @entity76 this season			1
@entity23 lacked creativity towards the end of last season and @entity33 has put his faith in the @entity83 - born midfielder to provide some much needed attacking oompf to his side			1
the @entity20 is full of tricks and flicks - and has been compared to @entity89 legend @entity88 and @entity91 winner @entity90 in the past - and he loves to provide an assist , with five last season			2
he was also awarded nine @entity59 awards , meaning he accrued further points as a result			0
however , most impressively he added goals to his game in 2013			2
a return of 14 goals from 37 league matches is extremely high for a midfielder - especially one who will cost just £ 5.9m in @entity3			1
on @entity76 : @entity18 will provide some much - needed attacking flair to @entity23 this season contribution : @entity18 scored 14 times in 37 matches in @entity24 for @entity25 during the last campaign the @entity109 proved his worth in it 's early doors for @entity18 at @entity23 but the striker has impressed in parts during his two pre-season outings for the @entity89			1
in his first match against @entity117 he struggled to get into a game which @entity23 lost 3 - 1 - but his next appearance against @entity120 was extremely impressive			2
the midfielder arrived off the bench after 57 minutes and made a huge impact , scoring in the 72nd - minute with a classy run and finish to make the score 3 - 0			2
in fact , @entity18 was so impressive he was given the @entity59 award			2
@entity23 fans will have been licking their lips after seeing this cameo			0
off the mark : @entity18 nets his first goal for @entity23 against @entity120 after an impressive run and finish making an early impact : @entity18 has played twice in pre-season and has already won a @entity59 award do n't just take our word for it @entity23 boss @entity33 was effusive in his praise for his new signing			1
the @entity89 manager said : ' we 've worked really hard on this and he 's a player we think is important , which is represented in the fee and represented in his commitment to us			2
i 'm just looking forward to seeing an exciting talent			0
' he 's a player who has been on our radar for a while and he is a marquee signing for us			0
he represents for us all @entity23 fans love in a player			0
' he has flair but also real hard work and commitment			0
he will bring talent to @entity158 i hope our fans really enjoy			0
' @entity20 journalist @entity160 was also full of praise for @entity18 when he spoke to the @entity162			0
he said : ' the most common thing that is said about him is that he 's very much like @entity88			0
this is because it 's true and because he gets the fans excited			0
' he is very similar to what @entity88 was when he was 24			0
he is a wonderful player and he is someone that the supporters will certainly enjoy watching			0
' new man : @entity23 boss @entity33 believes he has signed a gem of an attacking midfielder for the @entity89 @entity174 's a better , cheaper version of ... loads of premier league midfielders at £ 5.9m @entity18 is the 87th most expensive striker in @entity3 's @entity3 game , despite his brilliant scoring record in @entity20 last season and his ability to accrue plenty of points			1
that means that a mind - boggling 86 midfielders cost more than @entity18			1
he is a budget buy who can add some valuable points to your side for a relatively small price			0
just a few of the players that the 24 - year - old is cheaper and arguably better than are ... @entity197 ( @entity198 ) - £ 7.2m @entity199 ( @entity23 ) - £ 6.7m @entity200 ( @entity201 ) - £ 6.6m @entity202 ( @entity203 ) - £ 6.6m @entity204 ( @entity205 ) - £ 6.3m @entity206 ( @entity207 ) - £ 6.2m laughing all the way to the bank : if you choose @entity18 in your team , you will be getting a bargain buy			1
