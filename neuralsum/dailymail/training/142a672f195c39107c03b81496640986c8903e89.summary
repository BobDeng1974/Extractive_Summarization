a man rolling a joint next to a police motorcycle and a woman taking a selfie behind the wheel are among those being shamed by authorities on social media			1
police in @entity10 posted photographs of the two offenders caught in the act to @entity14 with tongue - in - cheek warnings about safe driving in the holiday period			1
in the first picture a man can be seen in the driver 's seat of a car rolling the joint in his lap , in full view of the police officer who has pulled up next to his vehicle			1
# @entity45 , ' the police tweeted			2

the photos were taken by officers wearing helmet cameras in the week leading up to @entity61 , @entity65 reported			1
@entity10 @entity9 have issued 324 driver distraction infringements and 19 cautions			1
low visibility driving : two chairs attached to the head of this motorcycle rider while he drives in the centre lane fruit packs illegally tied to the back of this ute make it impossible for this driver to see through his rear vision mirror roll out the brown carpet ! open double doors at the back of this van allows the load to stick out the back the majority of notices issued were given out by unmarked motorcycles			2
this is not the first time police have taken to social media to shame negligent drivers			0
@entity92 in @entity93 regularly post photographs on their @entity96 page of law - breakers taken by officers from @entity93 and around the world			0
pictured are drivers with over-sized packages hanging from open boots , carpets rolling from the back of vans and mattresses loosely strapped to car roofs			2
there 's even a motorcyclist wearing a chair over his helmet			1
crazy photographs include trucks taking roundabouts and blocking lanes , ladders in the back of flat - bed utes that are n't tied down and back - seat passengers doubling up as safety restraints , holding on to beds attached to a car roof			1
the page has gone viral with more than 120,000 ' fans ' either send images or simply viewing the latest compilation of reckless acts			0
do not overtake truck while turning : impossible - this driver blocked a whole street when he tried to turn right , left ... who knows ? two cars transported illegally towed to the back of this truck landed the driver in hot water with police police have said while some of the examples are viewed as ' light - hearted fun ' , they can also lead to serious injury and sometimes death			2
inspector @entity143 , of @entity9 , said a motorist was killed last year when a load fell from the back of a truck at @entity147 , south west of @entity148 , and crushed the driver travelling behind			0
he said the images are evidence that these acts are not just happening in foreign countries with lax road laws , but back home in @entity10 as well			2
' we get sent pictures from time to time and it just shows that these acts are not just happening in other countries but here as well , ' inspector @entity143 said			0
wide load : piping laid across the top of this ute may have created some problems for passing motorists strange bedfellows : not one , but two mattresses stacked on one another while they stick out the back of this car 's boot mr @entity143 said where there is enough evidence to investigate a tip - off , police will usually take steps to prosecute drivers			1
but in most cases - such as the booted - up barbecue - identifying drivers can sometimes be difficult			0
' the barbecue driver had no number plates , and there was no date , time or place on the image			0
' ' it makes it hard to track down			0
' he said most of the images that filter through are of trucks and large heavy vehicles with illegally stacked or restrained loads			0
they 're potentially deadly death traps for cars , pedestrians and passing motorcycles travelling behind or past the culprits .			0
