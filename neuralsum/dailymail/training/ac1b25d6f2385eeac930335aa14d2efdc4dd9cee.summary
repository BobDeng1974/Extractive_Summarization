cervical cancer could be prevented by a commonly - used @entity3 drug , scientists say			1
the medicine has been shown to kill - off the human papilloma virus ( @entity6 ) that leads to cervical cancer			1
a husband and wife team from the @entity10 treated women with lopinavir and found that it wiped out pre-cancerous cells in 90 per cent of trial participants with no side effects			1
@entity6 ( pictured ) is more than five times more prevalent in @entity21 than the @entity22 human papilloma virus ( @entity6 ) is the name for a group of viruses that affect women 's skin in their cervix , mouth and throat			1
almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the virus			1
@entity6 is often spread during sex			2
there are more than 100 different types of @entity6 , many of which are harmless			2
however , some types of @entity6 can disrupt the normal functioning of the cells of the cervix and can eventually trigger the onset of cancer			2
two strains of the hpv virus called @entity6 and @entity47 are known to be responsible for 70 per cent of all cases of cervical cancer			1
these types of hpv infection have no symptoms , so many women will not realise they have the infection			0
since 2008 , a hpv vaccine has been routinely offered to girls between the ages of 12 and 13			0
source : @entity58 the findings , which will be presented at two conferences later this month , have been welcomed by scientists who think that in the future , women could be prescribed a drug to use at home , instead of enduring a biopsy or surgery to investigate any cervical abnormalities			1
the trial took place at the @entity71 ( @entity72 ) in @entity73 , @entity74			0
@entity75 and @entity76 , from the @entity10 , joined dr @entity77 at @entity72 , to examine 40 women with low - grade and high - grade stage pre-cancerous disease of the cervix			1
the antiviral drug lopinavir is used orally to treat hiv but it was applied directly to the cervix as a pessary in the trial			2
the women were treated with one capsule of the antiviral drug twice a day for two weeks			2
repeat cervical smears showed a marked improvement within one month of the treatment and after three months , there was a ‘ definite response ’			0
out of 23 women initially diagnosed with high - grade disease , 19 returned to normal and overall there was a positive response in 91 per cent of patients			2
photographic images of the cervix before and after treatment showed clear regression of the cervical lesions and no adverse reactions were reported			0
current hpv vaccines ( pictured ) are aimed at preventing the disease rather than curing or treating symptoms			0
other than surgery , as yet there is no effective treatment for the hpv infection , which is why the results of the trial have excited scientists ‘ for an early stage clinical trial the results have exceeded our expectations			0
we have seen women with high - grade disease revert to a normal healthy cervix within a comparatively short period of time , ' dr @entity115 said			0
‘ we are convinced that further optimisation of the dose and treatment period will improve the efficacy still further			0
‘ it is our hope that this treatment has the potential to revolutionise the management of this disease most particularly in developing nations such as @entity74			0
’ cervical cancer is caused by infection with ( @entity6 ) and is more than five times more prevalent in @entity21 than the @entity22			1
in many developing countries , hpv - related cervical cancer is still one of the most common women ’s cancers accounting for approximately 290,000 deaths per year worldwide			1
the same virus also causes a significant proportion of cancers of the mouth and throat in both men and women and this disease is showing an large increase in developed countries , such as the @entity22 , where it is now more than twice as common as cervical cancer			1
dr @entity76 said : ‘ current hpv vaccines are prophylactics aimed at preventing the disease rather than curing or treating symptoms			0
‘ other than surgery , as yet there is no effective treatment for either hpv infection or the pre-cancerous lesion it causes , which is why these results are so exciting			0
a husband and wife team from the @entity10 treated women with @entity3 antiviral drug lopinavir ( a molecular model is pictured ) and found that it wiped out pre-cancerous cells in 90 per cent of trial participants with no side effects ‘ further work is needed but it looks as though this might be a potential treatment to stop early stage cervical cancer caused by @entity6			1
’ vaccination programmes against @entity6 in the developed world are well underway but they are no use to women already infected with the virus			2
the current vaccines do not protect against all types of @entity6 and they are also expensive , which can limit their use in countries with low resources			0
the researchers believe their findings offer a potentially cheap and self - administered treatment that could eliminate early - stage hpv infections before they have developed into cancers			0
approximately 300,000 women die from cervical cancer every year , which works out as 800 per day or one every two minutes			1
around 40,000 @entity22 women are found to have abnormalities in the cervix every year and cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35 in the @entity22 , with nearly 1,000 dying as a result of the disease every year			1
dr @entity115 explained that the trial could not be carried out in the @entity22 die to associated costs and ‘ red tape ’			0
‘ we have full ethical approval in @entity74 and chose to conduct the trial there because of the extreme need for a self - applied treatment for early stage cervical cancer , ’ he said .			2
