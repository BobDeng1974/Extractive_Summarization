@entity10 , 22 , who has a first - class degree in accountancy , had two editions of @entity8 's @entity14 on her phone , including articles such as ' targeting the populations of countries that are at war with the @entity20 '			1
ms @entity10 's brothers , @entity23 , 30 , and @entity24 , 25 , were sentenced to 12 and 16 years respectively for their part in a plot to attack the @entity27 , the @entity21 heard today			1
brothers : ms @entity10 claimed to have downloaded the editions of @entity8 's ' @entity14 ' magazine to understand the convictions of her brothers @entity23 , 30 , left , and @entity33 , 25 , right ms @entity10 had just married when she moved to the capital in june , a mere month before anti-terrorist officers raided an address where she was staying in east @entity37			1
ms @entity10 , who lived in @entity38 with her family prior to her marriage , was sentenced to one year in prison today , having plead guilty last month to possessing material which was likely to be useful to someone committing or preparing an act of terrorism			1
ms @entity10 , of @entity37 , appeared with only her eyes visible beneath a black veil to be sentenced after being remanded in @entity41			2
@entity48 , prosecuting , said : ' these items contained both instructional and ideological material			0
the magazines are in @entity52 and are targeted at @entity20 living in the @entity53			0
‘ they contain two types of material : firstly , material which is designed to make the reader support , fund , or join the @entity58 , and particularly to encourage the @entity60 reader to attack the nation where he lives			2
‘ secondly , the magazines provide practical guidance on how to commit acts of terrorism			0
’ so badly decomposed : judge @entity66 told @entity67 at @entity21 ( pictured ) that because mr @entity71 's body was found 11 days after his death , the cause of death could not be established causing ' further distress to the family ... the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence ' a paper copy of the @entity80 newspaper , whose front page on february 2 this year announced the conviction of her brothers of terrorist offences , was also found when police raided the @entity37 address			1
forensic experts analysed the contents of the memory card on ms @entity10 's mobile phone and found it contained two copies of @entity8 propaganda magazine ‘ @entity14 ’ , along with traces of other literature that had been deleted			1
@entity24 , 25 , was jailed for 16 years and 10 months and @entity23 , 30 , for 12 years after they pleaded guilty to the plot at @entity98 in february this year			1
they were part of a group of nine @entity8 inspired terrorists who planned to blow up the @entity27 during a @entity104 bomb blitz			1
other potential targets for ' @entity108 style ' attacks included the @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , and the home address of mayor @entity115 brothers @entity23 and @entity24 had previously tested a pipe bomb after reading @entity14 which contained a recipe ' make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom '			1
issue 8 included an article entitled : ‘ targeting the populations of countries that are at war with the @entity20 ’ , alongside interviews of @entity8 recruits			2
it also showed readers how to use handguns , along with a guide on how to convert motorbike alarms into remote control detonators for explosives			0
the following issue lists ‘ important enemy targets ’ in the @entity138 and other @entity60 countries , including stock exchanges , airports , famous people , and ‘ anywhere where @entity144 gather ’			0
included in the magazine are instructions on how to start wildfires by using a timer from a washing machine to help build an ‘ ember bomb ’			2
the court heard the @entity152 , a division of the @entity153 , had analysed the instructions and concluded they were ‘ accurate and relatively easy to follow			0
’ @entity154 was jailed at the @entity21 today but has been on remand for 141 days and could be free in just under six weeks			2
@entity156 , defending , said @entity10 downloaded the material a few weeks before the raid because she wanted to understand why her brothers had taken the path they had			1
he said : ' she was confident that her brothers were innocent and they would be acquitted			2
' she accessed this material , which is easily accessible , before coming to @entity37 to understand the background and ideology which led to her brothers ' incarceration			2
' she is an intelligent and articulate young woman who does not share the views of others who do not care			0
' terrorist plot : ms @entity10 's two brothers were jailed in february this year after pleading guilty to part - taking in planning a terrorist bomb attack on the @entity27 judge mr @entity172 called ms @entity10 a ' good @entity20 ' and said there was nothing to suggest that @entity10 was herself involved in terrorist activity			1
he added : ' instead , this defendant with other members of her family , was devastated by the arrest and later imprisonment of her brothers for serious terrorist offences			0
' the family , which was previously respected in the community where they lived in @entity38 , were ostracised			0
mr @entity172 said he accepted that ms @entity10 had downloaded the magazines in order to explore and understand the charges which her brothers faced , but that material which can aid a terrorist and serious offences will always carry a prison sentence			1
passing sentence , he said : ' it goes without saying this defendant ’s criminality is not necessary increased by the guilt of her brothers			0
' but she is clearly moving in the milieu and that that some of those close to her have serious @entity202 outlook and certainly as far as her two brothers are concerned , terrorist intentions			0
' that connection has caused me to scrutinise carefully whether she is a fellow traveller in the sense she supports those who commit serious crimes for ideological or religious reasons			0
' but he noted when her brothers were arrested at their @entity38 home in 2010 her laptop was seized but there was no evidence she had any terror material or that she was part of demonstrations or participated in online @entity58 chat - rooms			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity10 , 22 , has been jailed for one year after editions of an @entity8 magazine were found on her phone in july
her brothers @entity23 and @entity24 , were jailed earlier this year for their parts in a plot to attack the @entity27
