@entity0 are in danger of losing their fourth @entity3 spot in the coming years , as poor performances from @entity6 clubs in @entity7 take their toll			1
this season , for the second time in three years , there were no @entity12 clubs in the quarter - finals of the @entity3 , while none of our clubs have reached the last eight in the @entity18 either			1
and with @entity20 and @entity21 clubs performing significantly better this season , @entity0 could slip from their current ranking of second to a lowly fourth by the end of next season			2
@entity27 look dejected as they exited the @entity3 in the last 16 against @entity28 last month @entity30 's @entity29 punches the ground in frustration as his side suffered a defeat to @entity35 @entity36 will begin next season with a higher ranking than @entity12 , once 2010/11 points are discounted			2
if @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 win all their remaining games possible , @entity39 will go into next season within 0.1 points of @entity0			1
even if @entity20 clubs fail to reach finals , a repeat of this season would see them overtake @entity0 in third place next season			1
@entity36 is guaranteed to move ahead of @entity0 at the end of this season , while if @entity20 clubs continue to perform well this season and @entity12 clubs fail to reverse their slump , the @entity6 could end next season out of @entity7 's elite			1
that would see @entity0 reduced to three @entity3 places for the 2017/18 season , with @entity57 taking the extra place from the @entity6			1
@entity60 's country coefficient rankings take into account the previous five seasons ' performance by teams from each association , which means @entity0 are set to lose a huge chunk of their total at the start of next season			2
@entity41 striker @entity69 celebrates as the @entity20 all but booked their place in the @entity18 semis @entity72 can not hide his disappointment as @entity30 were eliminated in the last 16 yet again @entity74 celebrates scoring at @entity75 as @entity28 knocked @entity27 out @entity76 the 2010/11 season saw @entity78 and @entity27 reach the quarter - finals of the @entity3 , while @entity80 lost in the final			1
coupled with @entity82 and @entity83 reaching the last 16 of the @entity18 , that earned @entity0 a massive 18.357 points , which will be knocked off the total at the start of next season			0
@entity39 and @entity36 will lose a significantly smaller number of points ( 11.571 and 15.666 respectively ) meaning that by the beginning of next season , @entity0 will have slumped to third , and be in danger of falling further			0
@entity92 celebrates as @entity40 took a big step towards the last four by beating @entity35 in @entity94 @entity95 runs at the @entity97 defence as they scored late to stay in with a chance of progress the @entity6 will still be defending a lead from @entity57 going into the 2015/16 campaign , although how big that is remains to be seen			2
each season every association gets points depending on how well their teams do			0
these are then divided by the number of teams that country provided for @entity7 competition			0
the previous five seasons make up a country 's coefficient			0
how do the points work ? each team gets two points for a win and one point for a draw , with half - points for qualifiers			0
teams get a bonus point for every round they reach in the knock - out stages of the @entity3 , or every round after the quarter - finals of the @entity18			0
qualifying for the @entity3 group stages gets you a further four bonus points , as does reaching the last 16			0
with @entity40 in pole position to reach the semi-finals of the @entity3 , @entity41 all but into the last four of the @entity18 , and @entity42 in with a chance of joining them , @entity39 are likely to out - score @entity0 by at least four points this season , and that margin would grow if all three @entity20 clubs reach the final of their respective competitions			1
if all three teams were to win all of their remaining games - with the exception of an all - @entity20 @entity18 final - @entity39 would pick up another five points for their coefficient , narrowing the gap to just 0.095 points			0
with @entity150 and @entity151 still in the @entity3 that may not be very likely , but any more @entity20 success will narrow the gap - and if the difference is less than four points , the @entity12 clubs will be nervously looking over their shoulders			1
a repeat next year would then certainly result in falling behind @entity57 for the first time since 2006			0
and even if next season does n't see @entity0 slump to fourth , without a significant reversal in the fortunes of @entity6 and @entity57 clubs in the next two years , the season afterwards would see @entity0 in major trouble			1
so if the likes of @entity27 , @entity80 , @entity30 , @entity83 and @entity82 think fighting over the top four is a struggle , they need to start winning in @entity7 - or it could be down to a top three			0
@entity0 are set to lose their points from the 2010/11 season , when @entity78 reached the quarter finals			2

@entity6 clubs have been *outperformed* by @entity7 rivals
@entity178 set to move above @entity6 next season
@entity57 could also overtake @entity0 , if @entity20 successes continue
@entity41 , @entity40 and @entity42 are still in contention for @entity7 glory
all @entity12 clubs have been eliminated already this season
one more bad season would see @entity0 lose a @entity3 spot
