when seven people got free meals at a @entity4 diner by completing its challenge of eating a 69oz mixed grill in only one hour - the owner decided to beef up his menu to defeat his customers			1
restaurant boss @entity10 has created an entire menu of 40 different @entity13 mega-meals			1
father of one mr @entity10 , 53 , beefed up his @entity16 - style cuisine to include a giant 96oz rump steak , a 6 ½ pound ‘ baby ’ burger weighing more than a sack of potatos , ‘ suicide ’ chicken wings covered in hot chilli sauce and a selection of giant desserts			1
inspired by the @entity47 television programme @entity13 , @entity10 , he claims to have the only restaurants in @entity49 providing an entire menu catering for food challenges			1
he has even bought the brand name @entity52			2
twenty stone mr @entity10 , who runs @entity55 in @entity4 , @entity56 , said : ‘ we do n’t think anything on our menu is weird - we just started to introduce a cow pie that the @entity62 character @entity16 eats and we have a proper bowl which is two - foot in diameter			1
meaty : the baby burger comes with cheese , bacon , onion rings , chips and a little salad wed alert : the @entity73 is popular with stag parties ‘ what we do know that it is very rare to have a whole menu dedicated to @entity52 challenges			1
the only thing we do not do is starters because that would be too much			2
‘ we even cater to vegetarians and have a @entity85 challenge			1
there is an even sign outside that says our place is ‘ the home of @entity13 '			0
‘ one party pre-ordered our suicide wings and i made them aware of how hot they were - but they added another ten portions			1
the more you tell them not to do it , the more they want to			0
‘ i am not sure why i do it			0
it is certainly fun watching people do them but it is also heart breaking as well			1
sometimes people get 45 minutes into a challenge and it looks like they are going to do it but then they hit the wall			1
‘ one guy had 15 minutes left and about 2 bites left			1
he just could not do it and it would have saved him £ 60			0
’ mr @entity113 's 69oz mixed grill challenge consists of a steak , two pieces of gammon , five pork chops , half a chicken , four sausages , two eggs , mushrooms , peas , a side salad and a bowl of chips			1
but amazingly one diner managed to complete the meal in 22 minutes			1
speedy : one customer managed to eat the @entity130 in just 22 minutes the menu has since progressed to include dishes such as a £ 29.99 @entity133 ; a tower of five steak burgers , five chicken burgers , with 15 other layers of salad , onion rings , chillies , mushrooms and ham			1
all the burgers , bought from the butchers next door to the restaurant are freshly made daily with a mixture of minced steak , cracked black pepper , caramelised onion and no other additives			0
the @entity37 - a two - feet long sandwich - comes in meat or fish whilst diners have the chance to down 75 chicken wings in 30 minutes or a giant sausage sandwich called @entity158			1
desserts include a six litre bucket of ice cream and a giant banana split featuring six bananas			0
so far the cooked - to - order 96oz steak at £ 69.00 and the £ 34.99 6 ½ pound double cheese @entity30 are to yet be eaten within an hour			1
the full spread : the biggest dishes that @entity73 serve up it 's safe to say that your hunger will dessert you if you manage to finish @entity73 's serving of ice cream food for thought : mr @entity113 's menu was inspired by the @entity47 television programme @entity13 , with the show 's former presenter @entity178 pictured tall order : the restaurant 's @entity181 ( left ) and kangaroo testicles ( right ) , which may be a little bit hard to stomach for some @entity184 : a tower of five steak burgers , five chicken burgers , cheese slices , lettuce , tomatoes , onion rings , bacon , thinly sliced ham , a few chillies , mushrooms , side salad all in a warm ciabatta bun and chips			1
mixed grill calories : @entity200 : a steak , two pieces of gammon , five pork chops , half a chicken , four sausages , two eggs , mushrooms , peas , a side salad and a bowl of chips @entity213 for meat option : a two - foot sandwich with melted cheese top and bottom filled with lettuce leaves , spicy slaw , layer of ham , mixed peppers , grated cheese , sliced steak , and mushrooms and topped with a sticky barbeque sauce , served on large plank with a bowl of chips			1
fish option : a two - foot sandwich with melted cheese top and bottom filled with lettuce leaves , spicy slaw , battered calamari rings , wait bait , crayfish and prawns , and topped with a seafood sauce , served on a plank with a bowl of chips			1
the @entity242 is another that has defeated customers			0
mr @entity10 added : ‘ the 69oz mixed grill was probably one of the hardest challenges but although i sold nearly 3000 , seven people completed it in the hour set - the quickest in 22 minutes			1
’ ‘ i myself can not get near those meals			0
i am quite a large person myself and we have found that it ’s the slight people who can complete the challenges			1
the large people just ca n’t do it			1
‘ apparently there is scientific reason for that			0
fat people have more fat so their stomach can not grow and expand more			2
i do n’t know if that is true			0
‘ we do a lot of stag parties and team bonding exercises coming from all over the place			0
more and more parties are coming in to attempt the challenges together			0
a dozen will try the challenge and of course the rest of the party are egging them on			2
‘ obviously it is very noisy			0
we are now doing less regular steak meals because if you have a group in attempting a challenge , screaming and shouting at one end and you have a table of two next to them making eyes at each other			2
it does n’t work and so we have had to change our menu because of it			2
’ along with giant portions , the 54 - over restaurant also offers a selection of creepy crawly delights and exotic food challenges			2
mr @entity10 said : ‘ we found that exotic meats are getting very popular with crocodile , kangaroo , ostrich , zebra and python often chosen			1
we are getting really busy with the ants			0
' @entity302 really like them			0
@entity305 , ants , and meal worm , all are kept in the fridge at the back so as not to scare the children			0
‘ last week a customer asked for @entity312 as apparently it is a delicacy in @entity314			0
we did n’t do it however because it would be too hard to come by and i think quite a lot of people might be disgusted by it			2
‘ people often question me about it not being healthy			2
it probably does n’t help that we do a @entity324 too as we do a lot of children ’s parties			0
we do get a lot of abuse for it but we just want to cater for everyone			0
@entity333 mr @entity10 ' 96oz steak , which takes up an entire plate ‘ our @entity37 can be done with quorn so it will cater for vegetarians			1
we would n’t turn anyone away			0
now and then someone will come in and they will say " you should not be doing that "			0
we just say " it ’s the customer ’s decision and we do n’t force anyone to eat anything "			2
‘ we are a little bit different from other places that do these challenges as we use quality food			0
what we have found is that if customers do not eat it all we are asked to put it in a doggy bag			2
if it was n’t of good quality why would they take it home ? ' the @entity85 challenge consists of a milder version of the adult ghost chilli @entity359 , a small hot dog and four two oz burgers , which they call a @entity363			2
seven suicide wings are laced with @entity365 in a smokey paprika and honey sauce measuring a stagger 1,578,548 in @entity370 heat units			0
@entity373 @entity372 sauce registers at 2,500 scoville units on the scale invented by @entity47 pharmacist @entity376 in 1912 .			0

@entity55 in @entity4 , @entity56 , serves up 40 different mega-meals
owner @entity10 was inspired by @entity380
menu now beefed up after seven people completed a mixed - grill challenge
they had to eat a 69oz mixed grill in one hour - one did it in 22 minutes
