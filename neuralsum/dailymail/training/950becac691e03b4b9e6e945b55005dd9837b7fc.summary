one of @entity1 ’s most senior judges actively campaigned to support a vile paedophile group that tried to legalise sex with children , @entity2 can reveal			1
lord @entity5 , named last year as an adviser to the @entity7 , was a key backer of the notorious @entity8 ( @entity8 ) which police suspect of abusing children on an ‘ industrial scale ’			1
an investigation by the @entity2 has discovered that @entity5 was a founder member of a campaign to defend @entity8 while it was openly calling for the age of consent to be lowered to just four			1
implicated : lord @entity5 , pictured in his full legal regalia , was named last year as an adviser to the queen it can also be revealed that the @entity21 judge and privy counsellor : @entity5 was a founder member of an organisation called @entity24 set up to defend @entity8 leaders facing criminal charges			1
it later published a sickening pamphlet claiming that children would be freed from the oppression of the state and their parents if they were allowed to have sex with adults			0
the 60 - page document , unearthed by @entity2 , is adorned with disturbing child - like pictures and sexual cartoons			0
at the time the organisation went under a slightly different name but had the same postal address as @entity5 ’s group had			2
when asked last night about his involvement in the group , @entity5 said : ‘ i have no memory of having been involved with its foundation or the detail of the work of this campaign			2
’ he added that any contribution he made would have been in general terms against a law banning ‘ conspiracy to corrupt public morals ’ which he believed ‘ could be used against a wide variety of people in potentially inappropriate ways ’			0
‘ i have always been deeply opposed to paedophilia and i never supported the views of the @entity8 , ’ he added			2
@entity5 is the most senior public figure to be implicated in the work of @entity8			2
today ’s revelations follow controversy over the roles of @entity68 grandees @entity69 , @entity70 and her husband @entity71 , who were all involved in the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) when it counted paedophile activists among its members			0
last night @entity5 said : ‘ on reflection the @entity72 gay rights committee should never have allowed members of @entity8 to attend any of its meetings			1
' i am very sorry for what happened			0
i have never espoused or in any way supported the objectives of @entity8 – the abuse of children – which i consider wholly wrong ’			2
nonetheless , the revelations are likely to raise questions about what vetting he underwent during his career			0
however @entity5 insisted ‘ there was nothing to report to the lord chancellor ’s department ... at the time of my various appointments			2
’ the revelations also prompted fresh calls for a full investigation of the links between the @entity100 and paedophile groups , following long - running allegations of cover - ups			0
@entity104 is already looking into @entity8 as part of @entity106 , its probe into allegations of a child sex ring involving senior politicians at a south @entity112 guest house			0
as @entity2 revealed last year , the @entity113 is also carrying out urgent checks into a whistle - blower ’s claims that taxpayers ’ money was handed to @entity8			2
@entity68 mp @entity119 said : ‘ today ’s revelations reinforce the argument that there should be a full investigation into the role of @entity8			2
' it ’s incredible that someone of such distinguished legal authority could misunderstand the need to protect children			0
’ @entity131 mp sir @entity130 added : ‘ i find it staggering			0
it was n’t a clever or appropriate campaign			0
they were a paedophile group and at the end of the chain were little children ’			1
’ @entity139 of the @entity140 in @entity141 , said it was ‘ more than alarming ’ that anyone in the judiciary could be linked to @entity8			0
@entity5 , now 61 , is the most senior public figure to be exposed as an apologist for paedophiles among left - wing political groups of the 1970s and 1980s			0
he has enjoyed a stellar rise through the legal profession , becoming a @entity151 in 1994 and a part - time judge the following year			0
in 2002 he became the first openly gay high court judge , being nominated for a knighthood by @entity155 , and in 2003 took up a prestigious role at the @entity157 in the @entity158			0
last year he was nominated as an @entity21 judge by @entity160 and appointed to the @entity161 , the elite group of senior politicians , judges and clergy who advise the @entity7 on constitutional matters			0
back in the late 1970s he was a newly qualified left - wing barrister when he joined the @entity72 , now known as @entity72 , which had links to known paedophile groups and attempted to lower the age of consent to 14 and water down child pornography laws @entity5 ’s involvement with the radical movement to legalise child sex goes even further than that of the @entity174 , documents uncovered by @entity2 show			2
he personally set up a group to support the ‘ executive committee ’ of @entity8 in the summer of 1979 , after they had their homes raided by police			1
images of child abuse and group literature were seized and five leaders , including chairman @entity185 , were charged with the rare offence of ‘ conspiracy to corrupt public morals ’			1
@entity5 and his colleagues called the organisation the @entity24 ( @entity191 ) , and it went on to distribute leaflets calling for the @entity8 ‘ show trial ’ to be dropped , and held protests outside courtrooms			1
in october 1979 @entity5 wrote a full - page article in gay rights magazine @entity197 , in which he was described as ‘ the founder ’ of the @entity8 support group			1
he claimed that classified adverts placed by @entity8 members , which led to the trial , were ‘ simply to enable paedophiles to make friends and offer each other mutual support ’ rather than to contact children or exchange banned images			1
a leaflet distributed by @entity24 and available through @entity8 ’s mailing list went further , claiming : ‘ this is a trumped - up charge designed to silence a group merely because it is unpopular with the guardians of public morality			1
’ and the prosecution was condemned as ‘ an attack on @entity8 ’s right to freedom of speech and freedom of association ’			0
a longer briefing note put together by the @entity24 called the paedophiles a ‘ minority group ripe for bashing ’ because they were open about their aims			0
in 1980 , a @entity228 collective used the almost identical name , @entity230 , and the same @entity232 address as @entity5 ’s group to publish a 60 - page diatribe that called for the age of consent to be scrapped ‘ for the liberation of children ’			1
the revelations follow controversy over the roles of @entity68 grandees @entity69 , left , and @entity70 , who were all involved in the @entity72 when it counted paedophile activists among its members @entity5 successfully proposed a motion at the august 1979 conference of an established gay rights group , the @entity246 , that it should affiliate itself to his new group and also call for the @entity8 leaders to be cleared			1
his actions were praised in the paedophiles ’ in - house journal , @entity253 , which declared : ‘ no longer alone – new group to support @entity8 ’ and said they ‘ owed much to a speech by barrister @entity255 , which @entity256 declared to be the best made at the conference			1
’ the following month the @entity24 held its third meeting at which @entity5 and @entity185 himself were present , as well as several members of the @entity72 gay rights committee			1
minutes of the gathering show that they discussed picketing the magistrates court where the @entity8 defendants appeared and state ‘ @entity255 ’ would ‘ ask @entity69 about the possibilities of using @entity72 ’s number to take messages ’			1
probe : @entity68 mp @entity119 said there should be a full investigation into the role of @entity8 records show @entity8 leader @entity185 – who was jailed for two years in 1981 – was a member of the gay rights committee at the same time as @entity5			1
the paedophile group was often discussed at the gay rights committee ’s meetings , and @entity185 was given its support as he came under increasing public pressure			1
last night , @entity5 admitted he attended meetings of the @entity72 gay rights committee when @entity185 was there , but added that his presence ‘ left me feeling extremely uncomfortable ’			1
he added : ‘ in the main , i provided some legal advice in the context of general civil liberties objections to the wide - ranging charge of conspiracy to corrupt public morals			0
’ and he stated that he has never wanted the age of consent to be lower than it is now			0
@entity8 folded in 1984 after the arrest of several more leading figures , including one – @entity297 @entity296 – who had worked at the @entity113			0
miss @entity69 , @entity298 and mr @entity71 have now expressed regret for the paedophile activists involvement with the @entity72 , while insisting they never condoned child sex and that @entity8 did not influence their policies			2
however archive material shows the @entity72 ’s @entity305 actually invited @entity8 to become an affiliate group in 1975 , offering them the chance to propose motions and take votes at its conferences			0
last night , @entity5 said : ‘ on reflection , the @entity72 gay rights committee should never have allowed members of @entity8 to attend any of its meetings and a clear separation should have been created with the two organisations			1
