by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 05:25 est , 6 september 2012 these spectacular photos show the surface of the sun in incredible detail - and yet they were taken from an ordinary @entity6 country garden			1
for as these clouds of solar matter whirl around on the fiery star 93 million miles away , they are under the keen eye of astronomer @entity12 , who is simply standing by his back door in @entity14 , near @entity15 , in @entity16			1
thanks to a special solar telescope costing thousands of pounds , mr @entity12 can take photographs almost as clear as the world ’s best observatories			1
the bigger the telescope , the finer the detail that can be seen			1
' i think the amount of detail you can actually see on the surface of the sun now is fantastic			2
i love watching the jets of gas that have been thrown off the surface			2
it can change from minute to minute			2
' he added : ' that is one of the most exciting things about this kind of photography			2
only the other day i saw a big flare go up			2
it only lasted a couple of minutes before burning up and fading away			0
' mr @entity12 ’ new telescope has a six - inch diameter lens which filters out the sun ’s harmful rays			1
its photographs , taken from his back garden , depict strands of hydrogen gas sticking out from the sun 's profile			0
filaments of gas shoot out millions of miles from the sun 's surface , before falling back down onto the surface of the star another filament takes off from the sun , as a sun spot - a relatively cooler patch - swims across the surface in the front - on images , they appear as dark lines or strokes and are known as filaments			1
mr @entity12 , a professional photographer , added : ' i try and get out as early as possible in the morning , around 9am			1
' as the day goes on the earth ’s atmosphere becomes very turbulent and you can actually degrade the image of the sun. ' photographs taken in the morning tend to be a lot clearer and sharper			0
' @entity24 in his garden observatory , which - ignoring the clouds - allows him to capture the spectacular images mr @entity12 is the founder and president of his local astronomy society and has been taking images of the sun for around five years			1
the father of one added : ' these photos have been taken over the last two months , since i got my new specialised solar telescope			0
' it ’s just about the biggest commercial telescope you can get , and filters out the harmful white light , heat and ultra violet light that would damage your eye sight			0
' now i can see the hydrogen gas bubbling and will dash out when the sun comes out between the clouds			0
' mr @entity12 will take thousands of images and then uses computer software to select the best shots and merge them together			1
his recent upgrade from a smaller solar telescope marks the culmination of a hobby that began when he was 11			0
mr @entity12 said : ' my interest in astronomy started when i was about 11 and read a book by @entity124			1
' that really got me hooked on astronomy and i ’ve been keen ever since			0
' it ’s very much a passion of mine			0
i ’ve got a couple of mini observatories set up in the garden now			0
