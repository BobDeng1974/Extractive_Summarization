@entity0 : an unlikely martyr , given his suspected gang links @entity3 has not yet told her children that their father is dead			1
‘ how do i explain to them that their daddy is gone ? ’ she says			2
such a task would be traumatic enough for any mother , but especially so for @entity11			2
her fiance , @entity0 , was travelling in a minicab in @entity14 on thursday evening when it was stopped by officers from @entity18 ’s @entity17 , who specialise in fighting black - on - black gun crime			1
the officers were armed with @entity23 submachine guns and there was an apparent ‘ exchange ’ of fire			2
moments later @entity27 was dead			2
he and @entity11 , both 29 , had been together since they were 17			0
they had two sons aged ten and seven , and a baby daughter			0
‘ @entity33 was a good dad , ’ says miss @entity3 , a student at @entity32			0
‘ he loved his kids dearly			0
his family and friends claim he was unarmed and have demanded ‘ @entity37 ’			0
but the man whose violent death triggered the @entity41 riots at the weekend makes an unlikely martyr			1
on the streets of the @entity45 estate , where @entity0 grew up , he was also known by another name : ‘ @entity33 ’			1
it sounds like an innocent nickname ; it was anything but			0
in fact , the word ‘ @entity33 ’ denoted his membership of a notorious ‘ crew ’ called @entity53 who strut the streets of @entity14 ’s @entity56			0
the stock - in - trade of such ‘ postcode ’ gangs is violence , intimidation and , more often than not , drugs			1
@entity27 himself , according to some residents , was a crack cocaine dealer who routinely carried a gun			1
it was an argument over a woman and drugs , they say , that resulted in the death of his cousin @entity74 , 23 , who was stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at the boheme nightclub in @entity79 , east @entity14 , in march this year			1
‘ @entity27 was paranoid about what happened to his cousin , ’ said one local			1
‘ he had a gun to protect himself because of what happened to @entity74			1
’ so much for @entity0 being a ‘ well respected member of his community ’ , as he is described on a memorial website			1
that respect was underpinned by fear			1
inferno : @entity27 's death sparked riots throughout @entity41 which proved incredibly destructive police : officers had numerous show - downs with protestors angry at @entity27 's death violence : these youths are shown using aerosol cans to set fire to shops ' shelves the @entity53 is an offshoot of @entity41 ’s ‘ man dem ’ gang which has links with @entity108 ’s ruthless @entity107 gangsters			1
back in the @entity111 , ‘ man dem ’ , whose ‘ territory ’ included @entity45 ( where @entity27 grew up , remember ) , controlled dozens of ‘ crack houses ’ and its psychopathic members or ‘ soldiers ’ , as they styled themselves , were believed to be behind countless shootings , robberies , kidnappings and gangland killings			1
the leader was one @entity123 , who police suspected was implicated in the murder of pc @entity126 , hacked to death by a mob during the infamous riot on @entity45 in 1985			1
@entity123 was just 14 at the time			0
he was eventually jailed for 12 years in 2002 for other gang - related crimes ( which involved torturing two rivals with a hammer and an electric iron , and pouring boiling water over their genitals )			1
the @entity53 is understood to have been formed after @entity123 was locked up			0
can there be any doubt that @entity0 , the loving father and ‘ respected ’ member of the community , was involved in this chilling sub-culture ? not really			1
burnt : a police car used as a road - block was completely destroyed by a gang of rioters aftermath : shops were destroyed and pavements strewn with rubbish on the morning after the riots emergency : firemen were working all day to bring burning buildings under control one photo circulating the internet shows @entity27 making a ‘ gangsta ’ gun pose with his fingers			1
in others , he is wearing a t - shirt emblazoned with the words ‘ @entity53 ’			2
how grimly predictable that there is a link , through gang membership , between @entity0 – focus of the @entity41 riots of 2011 – and the murder of @entity170 during similar riots 26 years ago			1
the eruption of violence in @entity41 is a chilling echo of the infamous @entity45 riots 26 years ago in which pc @entity126 was hacked to death			1
the disorder on october 6 , 1985 , was sparked by the death of 49 - year - old @entity179 after four police officers burst into her home			1
mrs @entity184 ’s son @entity183 was in custody at @entity41 police station after allegedly giving officers a false name over a car tax disc			2
the ensuing police raid sparked panic in his household on the @entity45 estate and mrs @entity184 , who had a weak heart , collapsed and died			1
the next day a small crowd gathered in protest outside the police station – much like the demonstration over the shooting of @entity0 by police			1
tensions spilled over into violence when the police station windows were broken and at 3.15pm , two officers were attacked and seriously injured as the gathering mob began to launch bricks and gunfire broke out			1
by the time riot police arrived to support firemen after a blaze broke out at a newsagent 's , the mob had put up barriers and prepared petrol bombs			1
as police were forced back , @entity170 , 40 , tripped and fell			2
he was surrounded and hacked to death by masked rioters wearing balaclavas and wielding sticks , knives and a machete			0
@entity222 , @entity126 and @entity126 were convicted of the @entity170 killing in 1987 but cleared on appeal			1
outside the @entity14 semi where @entity27 ’s parents @entity226 and @entity228 and younger brother @entity229 , 27 , live , there is further proof of the world @entity0 inhabited			1
one of the messages left among the floral tributes refers to ‘ @entity234 ’ ( a rival postcode gang )			2
indeed , @entity17 officers had @entity27 under surveillance amid fears he was planning to avenge the death of his cousin @entity74			2
he was about to be arrested when he was fatally injured			0
moments earlier , he had phoned his fiancee @entity3			0
‘ i spoke to him at about 5pm [ on thursday ] and he asked me if i would cook dinner and i said “ yes ” , she told the @entity241			0
‘ at about 6pm he sent out a message on his blackberry saying “ the @entity248 are following me ” , and that ’s it , the last time anyone heard from him			0
‘ by 6.15 , he had been gunned down			0
‘ i kept phoning and phoning to find out where he was			0
i did n’t know what had happened			0
’ later , she received a phone call from his brother			0
‘ @entity229 phoned me and told me what had happened , ’ she said			0
‘ i did n’t believe it			0
i kept phoning @entity33 , then everyone was phoning me			0
then i thought it must be true because i still had n’t heard from him			0
’ miss @entity3 says she and @entity27 , who also had a fourth child from another relationship , were planning to get married			0
she said she did not recognise the picture of @entity33 as a ‘ gangster ’			2
‘ @entity33 was known to police but he had never been sent down for anything before			2
he has been on remand			0
i ca n’t remember what for , but it was about nine years ago			0
‘ i believe that if he had a firearm [ on the evening he died ] and if he saw police he would run rather than shoot			2
when he was remanded last time , he said he hated jail and never wanted to go back there			0
i ca n’t see why he would have a gun on him at all			2
