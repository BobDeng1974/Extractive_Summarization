when @entity1 emerged through the arrivals gate at @entity3 on thursday afternoon he looked like any other young kid returning from a trip in the sun. unassuming , understated in many ways , the 18 - year - old is still at an age where a week ’s holiday in @entity11 would be grounds for parental concern			1
he could have easily been ignored by the massed ranks of travellers had it not been for the media scrum that formed his welcoming committee			1
one can only assume that in the days , months and years ahead this level - headed teenager will cope with being centre of attention			1
‘ it ’s been a bit of a crazy last few days and i ’m glad it ’s all sorted now , ’ @entity1 said on his return from @entity35 after signing the deal that has @entity38 football aflutter			1
‘ they ’ve paid a big price but hopefully i can put in big performances for them and establish myself and do well			2
‘ it will be hard to leave home and learn a new language but i ’m really looking forward to it , it ’s going to be a good challenge for myself and i ’m really looking forward to it			2
‘ when i first heard of the interest , i was kind of overwhelmed by it			2
‘ but the club have been great through it all ; they ’ve not stood in my way , they ’ve let me speak to them and helped the deal go through so i ’m really grateful for that			1
‘ the fans have been absolutely superb ever since i played my first game , they supported me even when i was not playing too well			2
‘ i would like to thank them for that and also the coaches at @entity67 , they are the ones that have developed me as a player , and the gaffer has given me a chance to show what i can			1
@entity73 to shine : @entity1 thanked @entity74 for giving him first - team opportunities at @entity76 @entity77 inspires @entity67 with four assists ‘ i would just like to say thanks for everyone at @entity67 for giving me this chance			1
since i was young i ’ve always wanted to play abroad so hopefully it will live up to what i ’m expecting			2
’ @entity25 have famously produced players such as @entity23 and @entity85			1
in @entity86 on thursday , @entity1 was posing for photographs in front of pictures of the celebrated pair as @entity25 unveiled the playmaker			1
but the 18 - year - old , from the small @entity93 town of @entity94 , played down suggestions of following in their footsteps			1
‘ i ’m not really thinking of that just now , i ’m just thinking of looking forward to playing for the club and trying to make a good show of myself			2
‘ they ’re two very good players but i ’m just concentrating on myself			1
everyone knows it ’s a great club , a very big club , good at developing younger players			2
that ’s played a bit part in my signing			2
‘ they ’re just looking forward to me going over for training and we ’ll see how it goes from there			2
‘ the deal shows that they ’re not expecting too much , too soon - it ’s probably a long - term investment			1
’ in good company : @entity1 stands in front of posters of @entity85 ( left ) and @entity118 at @entity25 yet amid all the hoopla which has surrounded @entity1 ’s transfers there has come a word of caution			1
aside from almost 400 goals for clubs and country , @entity125 ’s lasting gift to the game was a quote which will follow him to his grave			2
‘ i could n’t settle in @entity136 , ’ the striker famously said of his solitary season with @entity134 which bisected his 15 years at @entity135			2
‘ it was like living in a foreign country			2
’ whether or not the @entity139 had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek or not when recalling that dismal term in @entity143 is n’t really the point			0
@entity125 ’s meagre return of just seven goals in season 1987 - 88 after the @entity136 had paid out £ 3m was miles short of what was expected from a marksman who had no equal in the @entity150 game at that stage			1
by the time he shuffled back to @entity152 a year later - to the slight embarrassment of all concerned - his place as the poster boy for @entity157 players bombing abroad was forever assured			1
he has not suffered alone , however			0
@entity158 scored just six goals for @entity160 in three years			0
@entity162 ’s nine appearances for @entity163 cost approximately £ 1.5m a throw while @entity165 lasted just five weeks with @entity166 before announcing his retirement			1
mercifully , for @entity25 ’s latest recruit , there are sufficient cases of @entity171 who have thrived in foreign climes to take no shortage of encouragement			1
call @entity176 , @entity177 or even @entity178 to the stand			0
the kids are all right : @entity1 celebrates with @entity181 ( left ) , @entity182 and @entity183 ( right ) @entity184 first treaded the foreign boards with @entity11 side @entity186 before moving to @entity187 , @entity188 and then memorably @entity189			1
and while the current @entity191 assistant manager believes @entity25 ’s famed development of young players makes it the perfect fit for @entity1 , @entity184 believes that success on the park can only come if there ’s firstly a degree of contentment off it			1
‘ they are lovely people in @entity11			0
they remind me a lot of the @entity38 , ’ @entity184 said			0
‘ it ’s a lovely culture also			0
whoever goes there will have a wonderful time			0
‘ it ’s like everything else			0
wherever you go , people assess the type of person you are , the kind of personality you have and treat you accordingly			0
it ’s the same with @entity38 people			0
‘ @entity1 ’s a great kid and he ’s going to a fantastic club			1
it ’s one that ’s produced some of the best young talent in @entity11			0
he ’s going there at the right age and i ’m sure he ’s going to have an opportunity to play			0
he will have a wonderful time			0
‘ what i would say is it ’s always important you learn the language as it helps you to adapt a lot faster			0
‘ i ’m sure they will help @entity1 adapt and provide things like language teachers to help him learn the language			1
’ speaking from experience : former @entity189 , @entity235 , @entity67 and @entity236 midfielder @entity184 @entity1 is a smart kid , however			1
not too old for his years but certainly intelligent , mature and not lacking in confidence			0
his vision for the future – as laid out in an interview earlier this season – made for interesting , prophetic reading			0
he foresaw himself not in the @entity243 one day but in a more technical league where 5ft 6in players were n’t trampled underfoot			0
@entity246 was his stated preference and he was n’t far out			0
@entity248 – no stranger himself to the demands of being a creative midfielder – certainly believes both @entity25 and the @entity253 are good fits for the @entity67 product			1
‘ he ’s at a club that ’s always been great with young players , ’ he added			0
‘ if you talk about some of the young players that have come through there you are looking at @entity118 , @entity85 , @entity263 , @entity264			0
so many of the best young @entity11 talent has come through @entity25			1
‘ the thing about @entity267 is the game is really technical			0
they like to have the ball on the ground and to play it to feet which will suit @entity1			1
‘ if he is going to continue to progress in the way he did last season then the challenges are the normal ones - keeping fit , adapting and learning as much as he can			0
‘ he ’s an exciting young player			0
give him the ball and he makes things happen in the offensive third			0
‘ that ’s a serious asset in today ’s football			0

@entity1 has signed for @entity25 in a £ 3million deal from @entity67
18 year old says he is just concentrating on making name for himself
