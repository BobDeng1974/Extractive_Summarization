the body of @entity1 , naked from the waist down , was discovered in a bathroom at his gated , three - storey £ 2.6 million villa in the @entity5 on tuesday afternoon			1
the @entity7 neighbourhood is home to many of @entity11 ’s most powerful players , but @entity1 ’s surname was all that was needed to ensure his entry into that social set			1
the 47 - year - old grandson of @entity16 , once the world ’s richest man , @entity1 was an heir to the vast getty oil fortune			1
lurid early reports of his death and troubled past suggest a new chapter has opened in the tragic history of a family that epitomises , like no other , the saying that money does n’t bring you happiness			1
a string of @entity44 have died from drug overdoses , while another grandson of the family patriarch , @entity47 , never recovered after he became the victim of a notorious and brutal kidnapping			1
other members of the supremely dysfunctional family became embroiled in decades long lawsuits and divorces , always over money			1
even @entity1 ’s father , @entity55 , a supposedly squeaky - clean married philanthropist and classical composer , was mired in scandal when it emerged he had a secret second family			1
in this latest tragedy , police say a woman called them to @entity1 ’s home on tuesday , saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack			1
investigators say he had been having severe stomach problems and suffered significant bleeding in his rectal area			2
however , they believe he died of natural causes or an accident			1
@entity1 ’s former girlfriend , identified in the @entity74 media as aspiring actress @entity75 , 32 , raised the alarm			1
reportedly she had told him to see a doctor about ‘ painful bowel movements ’			2
@entity1 ’s former girlfriend , identified in the @entity74 media as aspiring actress @entity75 , 32 , raised the alarm though investigators do not regard her as a suspect , she allegedly has a history of psychiatric problems and has been arrested a number of times for harassment and disorderly conduct			1
reports in @entity74 suggest that according to police insiders , officers had previously been called to the house 31 times , usually over domestic disturbances			2
@entity75 and @entity1 were frequently under the influence of drugs when officers visited			1
then two weeks ago , @entity98 took out a restraining order against her , the @entity7 police said yesterday			2
at the same time as he took out the order , he said he had a serious medical condition and that doctors had warned him that ‘ heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously ’ , putting him at ‘ serious risk ’			2
twelve years ago , when @entity98 was being sued over a disagreement with a former employee , he was portrayed in court by ex-colleagues on a film he directed as a threatening , cocaine - snorting gun nut			2
educated at the private @entity114 in @entity115 , he later studied at @entity116 and the @entity117			0
intriguingly , records show he has been prosecuted 12 times for unpaid taxes			0
in this latest tragedy , police say a woman called them to @entity1 ’s home on tuesday , saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack the body of @entity1 , naked from the waist down , was discovered in a bathroom at his gated , three - storey £ 2.6 million villa in the @entity5 on tuesday afternoon @entity1 was the second eldest of four sons of @entity132 by his publisher wife , @entity55 was the fourth son of the family patriarch @entity55 , yet still @entity55 assumed control of the $ 4billion family trust when his father died in 1976			1
@entity55 married five times and produced six children , whom he treated with such disdain he never even bothered to attend their weddings			0
he became the world ’s richest man when he struck oil in the @entity145 in 1953			0
he reportedly showed affection for his youngest son , @entity147			0
but when he died aged 12 from a brain tumour , his father did n’t go to his funeral			1
@entity147 ’s mother claimed the tycoon had even complained about paying for his son ’s medical treatment			0
his other sons fared little better			0
his eldest son and heir apparent , @entity157 , worked himself into an early grave trying to impress his father in the family business			1
he became so despairing at his failure that he would stab himself in the arms with a letter opener			0
he turned to drink and drugs , and died in 1973 after overdosing on pills			1
@entity55 ’s second son , @entity165 , was virtually disinherited after his mother @entity166 — @entity1 ’s third wife — dared to drag her feet over a divorce when the tycoon decided to move on to wife number four			1
@entity47 ( left ) had his ear cut off by @entity173 mobsters after being held to ransom for a portion of his wealthy family 's fortune - which his grandfather initially refused to pay			1
@entity1 's father @entity132 ( right ) pictured in 1986 , a decade before his secret family was revealed @entity181 , the third boy , has gone down in history as the prodigal son			1
after a first job earning $ 100 a month as a petrol pump attendant , he joined the family business , but took to drinking heavily			2
he became a heroin addict soon after meeting his beautiful second wife , the @entity189 actress and socialite @entity190 they became darlings of the celebrity hippie set , partying with @entity194 and spending most of the @entity195 in a druggie haze			0
when @entity190 died of a heroin overdose in 1971 , a devastated @entity181 holed himself up in his home in @entity199			2
unsurprisingly , he was cut off financially by his father , who intoned : ‘ no getty can be a drug addict			0
’ the shortage of funds proved tragic in 1973 when @entity181 ’s oldest child , @entity204 , 16 , was kidnapped in @entity205 by the @entity206			0
when a $ 17million ransom demand arrived , his skinflint grandfather refused to help			0
it was only after one of the boy ’s ears was sent through the post that @entity98 coughed up and the hostage was released			0
traumatised by his ordeal , the young @entity47 slipped into cocaine and heroin addiction , washed down with a bottle of bourbon a day			0
@entity16 , a misanthrope so tight - fisted he put a payphone in the hall of his @entity39 mansion , failed disastrously in his quest to prevent his huge fortune spoiling his heirs in 1981 , he suffered catastrophic liver failure and a severe stroke , emerging from six weeks in a coma virtually blind and paralysed from the neck down			0
he could communicate by little more than a high - pitched scream			0
he died aged 54 in 2011			2
until now , @entity1 ’s side of the family lived largely in comparative obscurity			1
after inheriting the family business empire , his father @entity55 sold @entity34 to @entity237 for $ 10 billion in the mid-eighties			2
he then settled in @entity239 to devote his life to philanthropy and his real passion : writing classical music			0
however , in 1999 , he , too , plunged the @entity98 name into controversy after three previously secret children — then aged eight , ten and 14 — went to court to change their name to @entity98			0
they and their mother , @entity250 , it emerged , had been @entity55 ’s secret second family in @entity7 , and the girls had decided to claim their birthright			2
his wife , @entity254 , had been aware for two years about the other family			2
@entity55 and @entity254 ’s second son , @entity1 , meanwhile , had been trying with little success to become a film director			1
in 2003 , @entity1 was sued by a studio assistant , @entity259 , for £ 500 in unpaid wages for his first and only film , a horror movie made in the house where he died this week			1
the court heard how @entity98 snorted cocaine , spent heavily on prostitutes and carried a gun — keeping an arsenal of assault rifles at his home and threatening the film crew with them			0
‘ all of us lived in fear of his dark , violent moods , ’ said ms @entity259 in court			0
‘ he once screamed at me : “ i ’m going to kick you in the kidneys so hard that you choke			0
” ‘ he had no worries about spending thousands a week on high - price prostitutes , but he was mean as hell with everyone else			0
’ @entity283 , the movie ’s assistant director , said she saw @entity98 snorting drugs while on the set			0
she described him as ‘ a spoilt rich kid who does n’t value his own life or that of anyone else ’			0
money never bought the family patriach @entity55 love , a fact he belatedly acknowledged when he said he would have given half his kingdom for a happy marriage			1
now , with another troubled @entity98 life cut short , his family would no doubt agree the money that brought them such luxury has also brought seemingly endless misery			1
as one commentator said : ‘ they were born with golden ladles in their mouths , and they choked on them			0
