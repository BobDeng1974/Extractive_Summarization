' today mr @entity0 warned that @entity3 has succeeded by being an international trading nation and ' to walk away from @entity8 - our biggest trading market - would be a disaster '			0
he told the @entity11 conference in @entity36 : ' @entity3 must lead the debate for reform in the @entity1			1
banging the table for change and for the @entity1 to work better for @entity3			2
but not flirting with exit and putting party interest above the national economic interest			2
' because @entity3 walking out of the @entity1 is the biggest risk to our economy in the next decade			2
@entity1 exit risks @entity3 jobs , trade and investment and the future prosperity of the @entity3			1
' and every comment by senior cabinet ministers saying they would be happy or relaxed to see us walk out , and every hint that a referendum could happen as early as next year - before any meaningful reform agenda could be achieved - only adds to the uncertainty and risk for @entity3 businesses			1

@entity11 chief @entity71 said the @entity61 's absence from the conference was ' disappointing '			1
he told @entity74 : ' it was disappointing because i think it was a great opportunity , a platform for the business community , businesses from all over the country , to set out the case			0
' labour sources stressed that mr @entity61 was not ' dodging ' business leaders and had already appeared at 10 economic conferences , including the @entity85 's in november last year , which mr @entity19 and mr @entity86 also spoke at			2

@entity61 has spoken to the @entity11 twice in this parliament , he spoke to the @entity85 a few months ago , he 's at the @entity96 in a few weeks ' time			2
' ' i was there , as was @entity99 , setting out a pro-wealth creation message , but pro-wealth creation which will change things so it works for working people			0
' the @entity6 do n't want that debate , and they certainly do n't want to have a debate about @entity106 or about their policies on @entity8 which are putting off investment and damaging jobs , so they make up these silly stories			2

' so at a time when , even as our economy recovers , most people are not yet seeing the benefit in their wages and living standards , this is no time for complacency			0
' if we are to win the argument that @entity3 can succeed in an open global economy , we have to show that our economy can deliver rising prosperity for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules			0
and that is not what people think is happening in our country at the moment			0
' i want an open and competitive tax system that rewards work and supports entrepreneurs and long - term investment and wealth creation			0
' the @entity6 have been forced to deny plans to hold the in - out referendum as early as next year , insisting time is needed to secure a better deal with @entity177			1
