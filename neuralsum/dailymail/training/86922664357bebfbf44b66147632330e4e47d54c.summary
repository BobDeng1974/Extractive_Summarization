by @entity0 comedian @entity1 has told with heart - warming honesty how stand - up and relationship counselling saved his marriage			1
in the early days of his marriage he says he was a blunt , unemotional northerner who was unable to express his feelings to his wife @entity7			1
but when the couple separated he took up stand - up comedy and started talking about the split during his stage routine			1
emotional : @entity1 ( pictured with wife @entity7 ) only learned how to discuss his feelings when the couple split it was only when @entity7 chanced upon him performing that she fell in love with him again			1
they went on to get their relationship back on track with the help of some @entity22 counselling			1
‘ both stand - up and going to @entity22 changed me , ’ @entity1 said in an exclusive interview with @entity24			1
‘ i stopped being scared of talking about what i felt			1
the consequences of not doing that are bigger than the consequences of doing it			1
‘ when i was younger , i was n’t very emotional			1
but there ’s a point in your life where there ’s nothing to be scared of any more			2
i just did n’t realise it at the time			2
’ @entity1 , 46 , who has now told his life story in an autobiography , was raised on a council estate in @entity41 , @entity42			2
he met @entity7 at college in @entity44 and they married in 1993			1
young love : @entity1 married @entity7 in 1993 after the couple met when they were at college in @entity44 he assumed the traditional male role , providing for @entity7 and their sons – @entity52 , now 19 , @entity53 , 17 , and @entity54 , 15 – through a well - paid job in pharmaceutical sales			1
however , the long hours took their toll on the marriage , and the couple separated in 2000			1
in the same year , @entity1 made his stand - up debut , having chanced upon an open - mic night at @entity64 comedy club in @entity44			1
enticed by the offer of a free drink , @entity1 got up and started talking about his life			2
he found it therapeutic and was rewarded with laughter , so he did it again – and again			1
a comedy star was born , although it was a while before @entity1 gave up his day job			1
some 18 months after that life - changing performance , @entity7 came into the club with friends and was shocked to find her estranged husband on stage talking about their break - up			1
she says this was the moment she began to fall back in love with him			2
having discovered that they had both booked time off work for the same dates , the couple decided to go away together with the boys			2
devoted dad : @entity1 spurned opportunities to date other women , preferring to spend time with his three boys instead			2
he is pictured here with @entity7 and ( left to right ) @entity54 , 13 , @entity53 , 15 , and @entity52 , 17 however , their reconciliation was still far from a done deal			1
‘ even after the holiday , things could have gone either way , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ it was @entity22 that helped us			2
' we were able to discuss what went wrong			2
it ’s a @entity105 disease of building up barriers			2
i think that ’s breaking down now and people are more open to the idea of counselling and talking things through			2
‘ that ’s a really good thing			2
you ’ll probably have half a dozen sessions and the penny will drop			0
and that can change the rest of your life			0
' all of a sudden you realise things have been said but you could n’t hear them			0
’ @entity1 says that now he ’s radically changed and is always honest about everything			0
on stage , he allows himself to be completely vulnerable			0
he has also become known for his charity work			0
in 2012 , he completed a 290 - mile triathlon , raising a record £ 3.4 million for @entity127			1
however , @entity1 says : ‘ i ’m still a long way from being perfect			1
i ’ve learnt a lot about myself from writing my autobiography			0
’ his memoir – how did all this happen ? – is extremely funny in parts and sad , raw and vulnerable in others			0
the book suggests @entity7 has changed , too			1
did having three children under five contribute to their break - up ? ‘ yes , quite possibly that was going on , ’ he says			1
‘ sometimes people dismiss it by saying , “ oh , it ’s post-natal depression			0
it ’s a woman thing			0
” but you know what ? it ’s not			0
‘ being under a degree of pressure all day can be very serious			0
‘ looking after kids is the most important thing in society , it is the future , and it ’s the one thing that you can never practise			0
' there is never a lesson in school about how to be a good parent			0
you are just given the most important thing in the world and told to sort it out			0
’ even family experience did n’t seem to help the young couple – @entity1 ’s own father had four children by the time he was 24			1
‘ as i say in the book , on our estate in @entity41 , when we were growing up that was normal			0
’ but for @entity1 and @entity7 , the experience of having children was overwhelming			1
when the marriage broke down , @entity1 says he was incredibly lonely			0
however , he did not play the field , preferring to spend time with his sons			0
‘ there was the odd girl i went out with			0
but no one ever met the kids and i never saw anyone on the weekend			0
maybe over time that would have changed , but it did n’t for two years			0
’ so did he remain single because he always thought he would get back together with @entity7 ? ‘ possibly			1
but also i did n’t want any other call on my time apart from my kids			0
i did n’t want anyone saying “ but why ca n’t i see you on wednesday ? ” and i ’d have to say , “ well , if i ’ve got the boys i ’ll have to see if i can change it			0
” i just did n’t want any of that			0
‘ @entity7 said there were some parts of the book that were harder to read than others and some that were uplifting			1
' when i got into conversations with publishers and they said they wanted lots of funny stories i said , no , i ’m writing a book about my life			0
' i do n’t regard it as more unusual than anyone else ’s but what is unusual is i ’ve been in a position where people asked me to write about it			0
‘ my life could only have happened if all of those things had happened			0
‘ the pain we had in our relationship – it sounds cliched – but it made us stronger			1

father - of - three split from wife after long working hours took their toll
' the pain we had in our relationship - it made us stronger '
the comic found therapy doing stand - up comedy after split from @entity7
but the relationship was *rekindled* when she saw a performance by chance
