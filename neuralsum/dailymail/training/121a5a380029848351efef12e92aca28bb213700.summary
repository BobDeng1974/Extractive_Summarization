mind - boggling statistic of the week			0
yesterday marked 9,000 days since @entity1 were last crowned champions of @entity2			1
they have since been dethroned by rivals @entity4 in terms of title victories and — when hostilities are resumed between the two at @entity9 on sunday — there will be an edge perhaps unique to the fixture			1
it may be almost 25 years since @entity1 last won the league but only months since they blew their big chance to put things right			1
as @entity1 edged ahead of @entity18 towards the end of last season ’s @entity21 title race , @entity4 supporters found themselves central to their own worst nightmare			1
@entity24 scored two penalties in @entity1 's comprehensive 3 - 0 win at their fierce rivals last season @entity24 has scored more goals as an away player at @entity9 than anyone else in @entity21 history ‘ choosing between @entity18 and @entity1 for the title was like being offered two different types of disease , ’ reflected @entity33 , editor of the @entity35 fanzine on friday			1
‘ it was surreal but you just had to choose one and ultimately you knew you just had to root for @entity18			0
the thought of @entity1 winning the league was just unbearable			1
‘ when they messed it up and @entity18 won it , all the @entity4 fans i know just felt a huge sense of relief			1
how ridiculous is that ? ’ @entity33 , of course , knows it is not ridiculous at all			0
as former @entity4 boss sir @entity55 used to remind us as his final seasons at the club coincided with @entity18 ’s rise to prominence , @entity4 versus @entity1 ‘ is our biggest game and always will be ’			1
it was this concept , this fundamental part of the average @entity4 supporter ’s make - up , that saw them standing in @entity66 pubs next to @entity18 fans rooting for @entity68 as @entity24 ’s slip at @entity70 began the unravelling of @entity1 ’s challenge last april			1
equally , it is this that sees @entity4 anticipating sunday ’s game with unexpected zeal			1
despite their own modest form , @entity4 ’s recent results have been good enough under @entity79 to take them in to third place in the league			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , have the look of a side shorn of confidence and direction			1
on friday , @entity87 — just months after almost pulling off one of the most remarkable title wins — found himself answering questions about his own suitability for the job			2
‘ listen , command is lonely whenever you are at the top end , the leading edge of the game , ’ said the @entity1 manager			1
‘ football is very short - term			0
the people criticising me , those same people , maybe six or seven months ago , said i could n’t do anything wrong			0
@entity103 ( centre ) scored both goals in @entity4 's 2 - 1 win at @entity107 on monday night @entity108 ( centre ) has scored six goals in his last nine league meetings with @entity1 the @entity21 table , showing @entity4 in third and @entity1 ninth ‘ that is the way football works			1
you have to accept that as a manager and fight even harder			0
’ like any great rivalry , fear plays its part			0
on sunday , the travelling contingent from @entity123 may fear a backlash from a team embarrassed last april by the ease of @entity1 ’s 3 - 0 win at @entity9			2
at that time , meanwhile , @entity4 ’s support feared not only that @entity87 ’ team would win one title but many more			1
‘ it was the inevitability of that defeat in april that hurt , ’ recalled @entity33			0
‘ people were coming up to buy the fanzine afterwards and just shrugging their shoulders			0
they knew we would lose that day			0
‘ after all those years , it felt almost dirty to be worrying about @entity1 again			2
really , you should n’t worry so much about another club but this is different			0
you ca n’t help it			0
‘ we had taken so long to overhaul @entity1 ’s 18 titles — and then get to 20 — that the thought of them coming back so soon , so unexpectedly , to win one and maybe more was too much			2
’ @entity145 ( bottom ) was sent off for @entity4 in this fixture last season for fouling @entity149 @entity79 runs the rule over his @entity4 squad in training on thursday in @entity1 , the pain of failure — if that ’s what it was — was acute last season			1
that is perhaps nothing , however , compared to the trauma of seeing @entity160 ’s rebuilt team perform so lamely this time round			0
tuesday ’s failure to beat @entity163 and progress into the @entity166 knockout stages has only increased scrutiny of the @entity1 manager			2
currently , @entity1 are ninth , seven points behind @entity4			1
defeat on sunday would leave @entity87 with a point fewer than @entity171 had at this stage in the 2010 - 11 season			1
@entity171 was sacked a month later			0
on sunday , the identity of the two managers certainly brings some extra intrigue to proceedings			0
@entity1 wanted to install @entity178 as director of football before appointing @entity87 in the summer of 2012 only for the @entity180 to object			1
meanwhile , @entity87 suggested when @entity4 and @entity1 met during pre-season in @entity182 that @entity178 may be ‘ surprised ’ by the @entity21 , words that have subsequently sounded a little foolish			1
@entity87 was doing the same with his squad on friday at @entity1 's @entity186 training ground @entity24 on his haunches after @entity1 were knocked out of the @entity166 on tuesday night at @entity188 on friday , @entity178 was diplomatic about that			1
‘ maybe , he was right , ’ said the @entity4 manager			2
‘ the @entity21 is not so easy and i knew that in advance			0
the last matches of @entity1 they were a little bit unlucky			2
but you have to survive that as a manager			0
’ @entity178 knows about big rivalries , having twice worked at @entity197 , and spoke on friday like a man who believes he will enjoy sunday ’s experience			0
‘ i managed the team in front of 102,000 at @entity202 and we won 3 - 0 , ’ he smiled			0
if @entity1 are to get a result tomorrow then captain @entity24 will perhaps need to be fundamental to it			1
he will , of course , be reminded by @entity4 fans of his part in last season ’s title denouement			1
there will be no sympathy			0
@entity4 , including former @entity197 keeper @entity214 ( left ) are put through their paces at @entity188 @entity108 ( left ) and @entity217 will be the main threats for @entity4 at @entity9 on sunday ‘ most reds knows that he is their @entity221 ( @entity220 ) , ’ said @entity33			2
‘ there is probably some respect there			0
but he has kissed the tv cameras when he has scored at @entity9			0
he has done his bit , too			0
‘ he fell over last season and @entity1 blew the title			2
he will be reminded of that			2
to us , last season is like that moment in @entity234 when @entity235 appeared out of the shower when people thought he was dead			2
‘ it ’s like a bad dream , as if it never actually happened			0

it has been 9,000 days since @entity1 were crowned champions
@entity4 fans still class the @entity246 as their primary rivals
@entity1 go into the game in 9th , while @entity4 *sit* 3rd in the league
@entity24 will be need to be *instrumental* for @entity87 ' side , but he will be *regularly* reminded of last season 's slip by the home fans
