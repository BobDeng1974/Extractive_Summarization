by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity2 fears @entity3 might have repeated the mistake they made in allowing @entity5 to leave by letting @entity6 join @entity7			1
@entity2 's centre - half partner , 32 , will join the @entity9 on a free transfer this summer , 13 years after sir @entity11 made a call he later regretted in offloading @entity5 to @entity13			1
former @entity3 manager @entity14 has previously described @entity6 's move as ' the right decision for club and player ' , but @entity2 said : ' only time will tell if @entity3 regret allowing him to leave			1
deja vu : @entity2 ( right ) thinks @entity3 may regret letting @entity6 ( centre ) leave ' obviously @entity5 played on for quite a few years at a good level after he left @entity3 and the same thing could happen with @entity6			1
he 's a great player and it 's a shame he had to leave			2
' @entity2 , speaking at the launch of the @entity28 's @entity27 coverage , also believes a fully - fit @entity29 can excel in @entity30 this summer after his struggles at every major championship since he impressed at @entity33			1
but he stressed the importance of @entity35 and the future @entity3 manager not attempting to tame the volatile striker			1
@entity2 said : ' he has always limped into a tournament , he has always had problems injury wise			2
' if you get a fresh @entity29 going into a tournament , like we saw in @entity33 , when he was young and fresh with no injuries , you saw a guy who frightened teams to death			2
@entity7 - bound : @entity6 will join @entity7 on a free transfer this summer at the age of 32 ' i think he still has the capability to do that			1
you see that in a @entity3 shirt often enough			2
if he goes into a tournament fit , it gives @entity57 a better chance of doing well because he scores goals			0
' when asked about @entity29 's temperament , @entity2 said : ' he is a big lad now			1
he is older , more mature			0
he has been in a lot of situations - he has been in every situation a player can be in			0
' i have no worries about him dealing with that			0
i would rather see @entity29 sent off once or twice a season because i want him to keep that fire in his belly			2
' i do n't want people to take that spark out of players , because i think you lose something out of their game			0
' bad call : @entity3 were left to regret letting @entity5 ( right ) leave in 2001 @entity2 , meanwhile , believes @entity57 's opening @entity81 fixture against @entity83 will be crucial in determining if they survive the first round			1
he said : ' i think it is important that we get out of the first game with points on the board			0
if we do that then i think it is a given that we will get out of the group			0
' the first game against @entity83 is important			0
they will be more wary of us and if you look at it on paper , i think they have got to be more wary of us with the players we have got in the attacking part of the pitch			0
this is his time : @entity2 believes @entity3 team - mate @entity29 can excel in an @entity57 shirt in @entity30 ' they will have to be worried about that with the pace and the youth and the exuberance and the enthusiasm we are going to have in the first game			1
hopefully that gets us flying out of the traps like greyhounds			0
' @entity118 have an unbelievable strength in their attack , with the two guys up front , but their weak point is their defence , so i think we have a good chance			0
@entity126 is the unknown package			0
' top team : @entity2 ( second left ) is part of the @entity28 's @entity27 television coverage this summer			1

centre half @entity6 will join @entity7 on a free transfer this summer
@entity2 thinks it could be a repeat of the mistake @entity3 made by letting @entity5 join @entity13
the @entity3 defender believes @entity29 can excel at the @entity27 in @entity30 this summer
