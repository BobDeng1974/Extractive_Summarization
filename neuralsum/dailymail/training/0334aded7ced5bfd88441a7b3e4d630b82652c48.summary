had this been the @entity2 , everyone would have packed up at 0 - 0 with @entity3 deservedly hailed a hero			1
but the @entity6 ’s impassable effort had merely granted his @entity8 opponents an additional 30 minutes to breach his target – and that they did , twice			1
@entity3 , though , was above criticism , and his numbers told their own story			2
@entity35 's @entity34 held the previous best with 13 against @entity37 in 1978			0
it was the best performance from an @entity6 goalkeeper since @entity41 ’s exploits in the 1981 film @entity42			1
and @entity3 ’s display belonged on the big screen			2
only there was to be no fairytale ending , @entity27 emerging 2 - 1 victors after another pulsating affair at these finals			1
but it mattered not , the 35 - year - old had etched his name in the history books			0
seventeen of @entity27 ’s 39 shots had found the target , only the extra-time efforts of @entity59 and @entity60 managing to evade @entity3 ; by this juncture , however , his rearguard had tired and the netminder was exposed			1
@entity64 had been thwarted three times , @entity66 twice , even defender @entity67 had been denied on a couple of occasions			0
he had improvised to use his feet , chest and knees			0
@entity3 ’s heat map serves to highlight his red - hot display			2
he even swept up on the edge of his penalty area – @entity78 style – when called upon			0
ultimately , the only thing @entity3 could n't save was the day			0
in vain : but @entity3 's heroics were to no avail as @entity27 emerged 2 - 1 victors leap of faith : @entity3 denies @entity85 who had climbed above two defenders to head on goal @entity89 leave it late again			1

@entity18 goalkeeper was impassable as second - round match finished *goalless* after *90* minutes
but @entity95 keeper @entity3 was *helpless* as extra-time goals from @entity59 and @entity60 were enough to see @entity27 through to the *quarter* - finals
@entity99 gave the @entity6 hope when he made it 2 - 1 but the @entity8 held on to set up a last - eight *tie* against @entity103
