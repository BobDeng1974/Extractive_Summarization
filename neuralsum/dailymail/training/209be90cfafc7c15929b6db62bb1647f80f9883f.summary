‘ [ @entity38 ] would go on and on about how someone had stolen money from his flat			2
“ did you take my money ? ” he ’d ask , and i ’d say , “ of course not daddy ” , but it would grow and escalate until i ’d be at the end of my tether and shouting , “ of course i did n’t steal your money – why would i touch it ? ” ‘ what i should have said was , “ i hear what you ’re saying , let ’s look for it ” , even if the whole pattern repeated day after day after day			2

‘ i could have created a calmer environment			0
it ’s so hard to live with your mistakes when they ’ve personally affected someone you love			0
