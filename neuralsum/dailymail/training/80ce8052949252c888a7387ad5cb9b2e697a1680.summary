by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 20 february 2013 for anyone who has ever wondered what is was like to be a musician , a new website has the answer			0
musician @entity6 worked with director @entity7 to create a groundbreaking new interactive site to let viewers see and hear a gig from his point of view			1
the @entity13 , again site lets you move your point of view so it feels as if you are standing anywhere in the room - whether it 's among the crowd , next to the band or even up on stage with @entity6			1
and thanks to a bank of specially designed microphones that were dotted around the venue , you hear the music in @entity28 surround sound , so it comes at you from the direction of the performers			0
click here to watch the song ( may take some time to load ) and scroll down to see how it was made by using their more or even a webcam to move the point of view , viewers can see and hearwhat it really feels like to be on stage at a @entity6 gig organisers created a special 260 stage for the song , with @entity6 in the middle while 160 musicians are around the perimeter of the @entity49 studio the special gig was funded by car maker @entity51 as part of an advertising campaign			1
' musicians have been covering , remaking , and remixing classic songs for as long as we ’ve been listening , ' it said			0
' yet what @entity6 is doing with @entity61 ’s 1977 classic , @entity62 , is something well beyond a cover , ' the organisers claim			1
over 160 musicians took part in the recording , including an orchestra , a drum line , a row of electric guitarists , a musical saw , modular synthesizers , a @entity74 player , a yodeler , 2 different choirs , a harpist , a range of percussionists from around the world , and the @entity81			0
led by conductor @entity82 ( @entity6 's father ) , they backed the singer , who was at the centre of the room on a small circular stage			1
three panoramic cameras were mounted around the venue , along with specially built ' heads ' to capture sound in @entity28			1
' from the way we arranged the song down to the live performance , we were focused on the idea of immersing the live and online audiences ' audio senses by having the music come at them from every direction , ' said @entity6			2
' it 's difficult to re-create a live concert , but by using this 360 - degree approach , it opens up an entirely new kind of experience that will surprise people			2
' the site also allows the viewer to see the choir and orchestra , and pan around complete with 360 sound to hear exactly what they would viewers can also take a wider view to see the gig from an audience member 's point of view working alongside concert production designer @entity120 , director @entity7 transformed stage 14 at @entity122 in @entity49 into a circular , rotating music hall in which the stage surrounds the audience			1
as more than 160 different musicians fill the circular stage , they ’ll literally rotate around the crowd , creating an immersive sound experience unlike any other			0
there are three locations for 360 video and audio , and on the website you can select them and hear exactly what you 'd hear if you were there this bizarre recording device – sculpted into the shape of a human head and surrounded by lifelike ears – captures sound in a 360 - degree immersive style , the way a person would actually hear it if they were sitting in the performance space with the musicians			0
three of the heads were placed around the venue , including one on stage , so viewers could hear exactly what the musicians would			0
one of the ' heads ' created to record 360 degree sound for the gig organisers claim ' the result is a track that actually captures a moment in time			2
' it ’s not your typical compressed studio - recording , but an emotion - evoking , wave - your - hands - in - the - air , lighter - raising type of experience			0

project uses 360 panoramic cameras and microphones to allow users to experience a gig from the musician 's point of view
