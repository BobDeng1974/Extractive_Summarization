sir @entity0 wants to develop a reserve firearms squad to tackle the ‘ real and present ’ threat of a terrorist gun plot in @entity4 hundreds of extra armed officers are to be trained to deal with a @entity7 - style gun attack on @entity9 streets			1
the country ’s top police officer sir @entity0 wants to develop a reserve firearms squad to tackle the ‘ real and present ’ threat of a terrorist gun plot			1
the @entity14 said the force had already deployed more armed officers on @entity4 ’s streets to protect key sites in the wake of the slaughter of 12 people in an attack on the @entity7 offices of the @entity25 satirical magazine			1
he also revealed that police were in discussions with media firms to restrict live coverage of terror events should an attack occur in the @entity9			1
referring to broadcasts of the @entity7 police operations , he said : ‘ we want to ensure our ability to respond is not restricted by live coverage			1
’ @entity38 officials are now talking to tv stations amid fears that live coverage of police raids could compromise operations			1
@entity44 has seen a dramatic reduction in its firearms capacity in recent years , with the number of armed officers cut by 750			1
but sir @entity0 yesterday announced plans to train members of the @entity51 – often known as the riot squad – as an armed reserve in the event of a major terrorist attack			1
currently , 2,700 officers are authorised to carry guns in @entity4			1
the force is now reviewing the number it has available and one option is to create a reserve from the @entity51			0
yesterday , the commissioner admitted that protecting the public from the terror threat was an ‘ imperfect science ’ and police ca n’t make perfect decisions every time			1
he told the police and crime committee at @entity71 in @entity4 : ‘ if you have multiple suspects , you ca n’t follow all of them all the time			2
‘ nor can we guarantee we make a perfect assessment of the threat they pose today			0
‘ we believe we are coping with the threat at the moment			0
‘ we are looking to increase our resources but it is an imperfect science			0
‘ we are dealing with human beings here who sometimes change their mind			0
‘ it ’s not too intrusive , it ’s a reasonable system at the moment and it ’s been effective			0
‘ but the threat is real and present			2
’ he also said the force was caught in a dilemma about whether to lone patrols amid fears that fanatics plan to target police officers			2
’ it ’s a dilemma			0
we have done more double crews over the last few months but if we double crew everyone we halve our flexibility ’ , sir @entity0 said			1
he told the committee there had been ‘ really good support ’ from the @entity4 community since the @entity7 attacks			1
more parents of children at risk of being influenced to travel to @entity122 and @entity123 were coming forward to police , sir @entity0 added			1
sir @entity0 said the force was in discussion with the government over more funding for counter-terror operations , adding : ‘ police need tens of millions of pounds more			1
’ his call for extra resources came on the day that the @entity132 said that funding cuts will mean forces can no longer deliver an effective service to the public			0
@entity138 chief constable @entity137 , who is @entity132 ’s workforce development spokesman , issued the warning after it was revealed that officer numbers had sunk to their lowest level for 14 years			0
twelve people were killed when gunmen ( pictured ) stormed the office of @entity25 in @entity7 on january 7 ‘ we are concerned that if budget cuts continue in the current trend there will be a point in the future when forces are unable to deliver the effective and efficient service that the public expects , ’ he said			2
‘ each force comes to these financial challenges from a different starting point ; some will be hit harder and feel the impact earlier than others			0
’ @entity162 statistics showed there were 127,075 officers across the 43 forces covering @entity166 and @entity167 , down 1,295 in a year and around 17,000 fewer than in 2010			0
all but 14 forces shed posts over the 12 months			0
yesterday , the @entity167 chairman @entity170 said : ‘ there can be no doubt that the drastic cuts in force budgets is doing real harm to the ability of the service to protect the public			2
‘ we hear that crime is falling but this only measures a snapshot of police activity			0
what we do not hear about is the extreme pressure these @entity127 cuts are placing on officers ’ ability to prevent terrorist attacks , manage sex offenders in the community , protect children from sexual exploitation and return missing persons to their families among other key issues			2
‘ officers are at breaking point			0
you can not create a better police service by imposing swingeing cuts on its budgets - all that will achieve is to cut the service officers are able to give the public			2
