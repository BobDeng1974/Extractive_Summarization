a shunt is a thin plastic tube that is inserted during surgery			1
it is used to treat people with fluid on the brain			2
without it , the fluid can cause pressure inside the skull to build up and , in extreme cases , this can be fatal			0
the shunt transports excess fluid into another part of the body - usually the abdomen			2
from here , it is absorbed into the bloodstream			0
the shunt surgery usually takes place under general anaesthetic and takes one to two hours			2

i had no control of my leg and i just crashed to the ground			0
‘ i went to @entity92 and they told me i was going to need a ct scan and then afterwards they told me i was going to be transferred to the neurology department because they spotted something on my brain scan			1
‘ an mri scan showed that i had a fluid block in my brain and that i ’d need a shunt , where fluid is passed from one part of the body to another , to drain the fluid			1
‘ it ’s was a truly frightening experience for myself and my family but i felt much better when i got transferred closer to home			0
’ ms @entity5 was rocked by the news that she may lose the ability to walk due to her cancer and doctors even told her she could become infertile			1
she said : ‘ i ’d been in the hospital in @entity11 for a few weeks then they were able to transfer me to the @entity118 so i could be closer to home			2
‘ they thought my tumour was benign at first , but then after more tests they found out the cancer had spread to my spine			0
‘ i was actually told that i could lose the ability to walk and that there was a chance i ’d have to be fed through a tube in the future			0
ms @entity5 ( pictured with her mother , @entity131 ) said : ' i was absolutely petrified because i knew i 'd been unwell for some time but i had no idea it was so serious ' ms @entity5 was told she could lose the ability to walk or become infertile as a result of her illness and treatment			1
