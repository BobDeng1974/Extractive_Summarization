by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 03:32 est , 7 january 2014 row : @entity2 has weighed in on the conflict on the 100th anniversary of @entity8 backing @entity6 's theory that it was sparked by @entity11 expansionism @entity12 and @entity2 rode to @entity6 ’s defence over his call to banish the ‘ left - wing myths ’ of the @entity8 depicted on shows like @entity17			1
@entity18 said the @entity19 was right to blame @entity11 militarism for the outbreak of the war , while the @entity24 mayor joined him in condemning the @entity25			0
but mr @entity6 found himself exposed to a counter attack as @entity27 and a @entity29 academic he has condemned , embarked on a new round of hostilities			1
the deputy prime minister said the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war should be a time for ‘ sombre reflection ’ , not ‘ wagging the finger of blame ’			1
and professor sir @entity38 , regius professor of history at @entity29 , said mr @entity6 ‘ should be ashamed of himself ’			1
the row began last week when the @entity42 ran an article by mr @entity6 in which he argued that the @entity8 was every bit as ‘ just ’ as the fight against @entity46			1
he criticised the @entity17 and @entity47 ! what a @entity49 view of the war ‘ as a misbegotten shambles ’ , as well as ‘ left - wing academics all too happy to feed those myths by attacking @entity55 ’s role in the conflict ’			0
he singled out sir @entity38 , accusing him of ‘ adopting the attitude of an undergraduate cynic ’			1
at the weekend , @entity61 education spokesman and historian @entity60 branded it an ‘ ugly ’ attempt to ‘ politicise ’ the centenary commemorations			0
but @entity2 yesterday called for mr @entity60 to quit , saying : ‘ it is a sad but undeniable fact that the @entity8 , in all its murderous horror , was overwhelmingly the result of @entity11 expansionism and aggression			1
‘ if @entity60 seriously denies @entity11 militarism was at the root of the @entity8 , he is not fit to do his job , either in opposition or in government , and should resign			2
’ @entity12 ’s official spokesman also backed mr @entity6			0
reality of war : @entity78 and @entity55 soldiers in trenches on the @entity80 in 1916 he said the 100th anniversary is an opportunity to ‘ commemorate the fallen ’ and reflect on ‘ peace in @entity85 ’			2
the spokesman said : ‘ i think we can do that without being afraid of saying it was right for @entity55 to respond to aggression and to enter the war on that basis			0
’ but mr @entity27 , who has repeatedly clashed with mr @entity6 , suggested the @entity19 should have kept his thoughts to himself			2
the @entity95 leader said : ‘ i do n’t think anyone sensible is saying you should airbrush out history			0
it ’s the question about whether you think this is the occasion to start apportioning blame or wagging the finger			0
conflict : @entity6 has come under fire from @entity27 who said this is the time for ' sombre reflection ' ‘ i think most people want a slightly more sombre and sensible reflection about what wars on that scale mean , how we , particularly in @entity85 , have overcome that			1
’ on sunday , sir @entity113 , who played @entity114 in @entity115 , described mr @entity6 ’s comments as a ‘ very , very silly mistake ’			0
professor @entity38 accused mr @entity6 of a ‘ personal attack ’			1
he points out right - wing historians like @entity121 and former @entity123 mp @entity122 – who alluded to the phrase ‘ lions led by donkeys ’ for the soldiers and their generals – have also condemned the war			0
he added : ‘ defaming historians and others who think and write critically about @entity55 ’s role in the @entity8 by accusing them of seeking to “ denigrate virtues such as patriotism , honour , and courage ” is no way to conduct the debate @entity6 says he wants to encourage			2
he should be ashamed of himself			0
