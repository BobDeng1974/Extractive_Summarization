@entity1 can reach their first two targets of the season in the next two weeks by reaching the last 16 of the @entity4 and beating @entity5 in the @entity7 final , manager @entity0 said on monday			1
the first target can be achieved on tuesday when @entity1 hosts last season 's beaten finalists @entity11 in their final @entity4 group a match and the second on december 22nd when @entity1 faces @entity5 in the cup match in @entity15			1
the others - the @entity18 crown and the @entity4 title - will have to wait a little longer			1
@entity0 ( right ) wants @entity1 to reach the last 16 of the @entity4 on tuesday @entity20 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity1 striker @entity22 during training on monday @entity11 are already through to the last 16 and will win the group as long as they do not lose by a margin of two goals or more to @entity1			1
the @entity27 will go through with a draw or if @entity29 do not win their match against already eliminated @entity31			0
if @entity1 beat @entity11 by two goals or more they will finish top but @entity29 can still pip them for a qualifying place if @entity1 lose and the @entity35 win , so @entity0 is taking nothing for granted			1
@entity37 walks onto the @entity1 training pitch followed by boss @entity0 @entity0 looks on during his team 's monday morning training session ' we have to reach the knock - out stage , ' he told reporters on monday			2
' it is this season 's first goal , with the second not too far behind			0
' a year ago @entity1 faced a similar situation only to lose in @entity49 to @entity50 and finish in third place			0
@entity1 are unbeaten in their last nine @entity54 matches at home and @entity0 is optimistic that his men wo n't slip up now			2
@entity0 will be hoping that @entity20 can lead his side to victory over @entity11 in tuesday 's encounter ' i have a very strong team that has shown it can play at this level in the five previous games , ' @entity0 added			1
despite both clubs boasting @entity54 pedigrees going back to the 1950s , they have only met once previously with @entity11 beating @entity1 1 - 0 in @entity11 in october with @entity67 scoring the only goal			2
he says that the two teams will be approaching tuesday 's match in very different frames of mind			0
' it a completely different scenario			0
we want to finish in first place and , therefore , avoid other group winners , while @entity11 wants to protect its leadership			0
' @entity0 praised @entity79 for taking @entity11 to @entity81 glory last season over @entity83 and @entity84 but he was guarded when asked if @entity79 , @entity11 's coach , would be a worthy winner of @entity86 's @entity88 award			1
' @entity79 is doing a terrific job , ' @entity0 said			0
' to win ' @entity81 ' finishing ahead of giants like @entity83 and @entity84 is exceptional			0
' but @entity91 and @entity92 are also deserving , ' he said of @entity93 who led @entity83 to the @entity4 title last season and @entity92 who coached @entity96 to @entity98 glory .			2

@entity0 wants to lead @entity1 into @entity4 last 16
