if you ’ve ever burnt your tongue sipping a fresh cup of coffee , this table could save your tastebuds			0
created by a @entity9 data researcher , the thermal mapping table uses a projector with a thermal imaging @entity12 case			1
when items are placed on the table , the case identifies even slight changes in temperature to reveal when a beverage is safe to drink			0
in a video , a glass of ice water is shown turning the table blue , while a glass of hot water is shown turning it red			1
@entity22 also pours cold and hot water into a tray , to see how the liquids combine , and shows what a @entity43 ’s battery looks like under thermal imaging			1
projection mapping uses video projectors , but instead of projecting the image onto a flat screen it maps the light onto any surface			2
this light scatters the pixels of an image , and turns any surface – in this case , a table - into an interactive display			2
the process is also known as spatial augmented reality and video mapping , and is typically used for adverts			0
the project can be created by anyone using a projector and @entity29 case ( pictured left )			1
the case is fitted with its own battery and lasts for 2 hours continuous use on a single charge			0
example image is pictured right in a video , a cup of ice water is shown turning the table blue , while a cup of hot water is shown turning it red			1
mr @entity22 also pours cold and hot water into a tray ( pictured ) , to see how the liquids combine mr @entity22 began by turning the table into a display using the projector , before beaming images and light via the £ 260 ( $ 349 in the @entity88 ) @entity12 case			1

using sensor technology originally developed for military night vision , @entity29 converts heat to colour images in real time			2
these images let users see in the dark , but also reveal slight differences in temperature			0
for example , it can detect minimal changes in temperature of just 0.1 ° c to show which areas of an object are hotter , or cooler , than others			0
‘ by projecting colours determined by the @entity29 onto the surface of objects , you can see the temperature of objects visually , ’ explained mr @entity22 on his @entity121 channel			2
‘ ice becomes blue , a glass containing hot water becomes red , and you can even see how ice water and hot water mix. ’ the project can be created by anyone using a projector and @entity29 case			1
the case is currently only available for the @entity140 and @entity12 5s			0
he additionally shows what a macbook ’s battery looks like under thermal imaging ( pictured )			1

the thermal table was created by @entity9 data researcher @entity22
he projected light via a @entity12 case onto a table using a projector
projection mapping scatters light onto surfaces to turn them into displays
while the @entity29 case uses sensors to convert heat into colour images
in a video , mr @entity22 shows ice water in a glass turning the table blue
cup of hot water is then used to turn the table red where the cup is placed
@entity192 also shows how a @entity43 ’s battery appears using thermal imaging
