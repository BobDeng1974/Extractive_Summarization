a grandfather who sawed off his hand while building a @entity3 house for his two granddaughters has regained near perfect movement in his hand thanks to emergency surgery			1
@entity8 , 60 , from @entity9 , nearly lost his arm when his sleeve got dragged into a saw and chopped off his hand last summer			1
his panicked wife @entity13 had to hunt through the grass to find it and put it in a plastic bag for paramedics , as he desperately tried to stop blood gushing from the stump			0
after multiple surgeries , the @entity23 enthusiast 's hand is back in almost perfect working condition			1
he has even put the @entity27 project on hold so he can build a 32m kitchen extension			1
@entity8 , 60 , managed to chop off his hand with a saw when he was building a @entity3 house for his granddaughters			1
he was rushed to hospital for a seven hour operation which saved his hand the inside of mr @entity8 's wrist ( pictured ) bears just a few scars			1
he says he can now do most of the things he did before with his hand , although he has lost some dexterity mr @entity8 has had three operations in total and his hand is almost in perfect working condition			1
he has even bought a new saw so he can carry on doing @entity23 mr @entity8 said : ' at first , there was just all this gushing blood and i did n't know what had happened			1
' then i realised i did n't have a hand anymore			1
' but you ca n't let little things like this stop you so i bought another saw as soon as i could			1
' my wife was n't quite so happy about that			0
mr @entity8 had gone out into his garden to work on a wooden @entity27 as a surprise present for his two granddaughters @entity56 , seven , and @entity57 , five			1
feeling a bit cold , he decided he needed a jumper and went back into the house to fetch one			1
but once he was back at the saw , his sleeve became trapped and the blade sliced off his hand			1
keeping calm , mr @entity8 , who teaches electrical engineering , managed to put pressure on his gushing wound and wander into the house to let his wife know that she needed to call 999			1
' she knew exactly what i had done by the way i was holding my arm and she went into shock , ' said mr @entity8			1
' if i 'd fainted , it could have been fatal as my wife was inside the house doing the cleaning and would n't have known a thing about it			1
' i was calm and i stayed outside on the patio			0
when the ambulance arrived , i asked my wife to go and find my hand and put it in a plastic bag			2
' just 20 minutes later mr @entity8 arrived at @entity86 , with his hand in a bag			1
plastic surgeon @entity89 explains that the situation was life threatening			0
' @entity8 was taken to the major resuscitation area of @entity93 , ' he told @entity94			1
plastic surgeon @entity89 , assisted by orthopaedic surgeon @entity95 and associate specialist @entity96 , of @entity86 , battled for seven hours to save mr @entity8 's hand			1
from the moment he was rushed into hospital they were working against the clock , as the muscles in the hand can die within four hours			1
they carried out a complicated replantation procedure , which took seven hours			0
first , mr @entity95 re-attached mr @entity8 's bones with plates and screws			1
this is so the plastic surgeons have a stable surface to work on while they reattach the blood vessels , tendons and nerves			0
mr @entity89 re-established the blood supply to the hand by reconnecting the blood vessels as soon as possible			2
this meant the hand was pink , and the tissues kept alive			2
then , he reconnected 25 tendons and three major nerves using a microscope			0
the next day he performed another five hour operation to repair more tendons , and mr @entity8 was sent home after a week			1
after a year of physiotherapy , mr @entity8 had gained 70 per cent of movement in hand			1
recently , he had a simple operation to repair some of the tendons , to give him a better grip			0
mr @entity89 said mr @entity8 's case was exceptional			1
he said : ' it 's very variable whether you see full movement again			2
there are lots of factors that people can not control , such as some people just have more scar tissue			0
' some you can control , however - the quality of the physiotherapy and the patient 's determination			2
' in this case we had good quality physio and a very determined patient			0
' this is one of the cases i ’m most proud of and i 'm very satisfied i ’ve got such a happy patient			0
' he advised anyone who has cut off a body part to wrap it up in cling film to keep it clean and to bring it to hospital immediately			2
' it was life threatening because of the loss of blood			0
so doctors were working to keep his blood pressure stable and make sure he was getting fluids			0
' you only have a short period - four hours - before the muscle in the hands start to die so we needed to operate soon			0
' they rushed mr @entity8 into an emergency operation , called a ' replantation ' procedure			1
assisted by orthopaedic surgeon @entity95 and associate specialist @entity96 , mr @entity89 battled for seven hours to reattach his hand			2
first , mr @entity95 re-attached mr @entity8 's bones with plates and screws			1
' this is so we have a stable surface to work on to reattach the other bits , ' mr @entity89 said			0
@entity184 then worked to re-connect the blood vessels to restore the blood supply , so the muscles in the hand did n't die			2
once this was done he reattached the tendons and the nerves			0
mr @entity89 said : ' there were 25 tendons to repair and three major nerves			0
that 's why it took so long			0
and a lot of it was was done down the microscope			0
' after another five - hour operation the next day , mr @entity8 spent just five days in hospital before returning home , desperate to get back to his garden to carry on work			1
incredibly , physiotherapy meant that within a week of being home he could wiggle the tips of his fingers and was back driving after three months			2
and less than a year later mr @entity8 was back working his garden , this time on a kitchen extension for his home			1
he said : ' this has n't put me off at all - you ca n't sit back and let accidents like this worry you - you 've got to get on with life			0
' i kept the tendons stretching and the muscles tensing and the movement has come back - it 's 70 per cent of what it was originally and it came back naturally			0
' people have said that i 'm a medical miracle - my surgeon mr @entity89 said the operation was remarkable and he was very proud of his work - and i do realise how very lucky i am			0
' at the time i just understood what i 'd done and what i had to do			0
' there were times since when i thought i would never get the use of my hand again but , fortunately , because the treatment i 've had , i can do most of the things i did before			2
' the hospital and rehab teams have been absolutely fantastic			2
' i 've just had another operation to give me even more flexibility			0
' some more intricate things are harder to do because i do n't have the same dexterity but i 'm fine with lifting and carrying			0
' after the accident mr @entity8 ( left ) went into the house to ask his wife @entity13 ( right ) to call an ambulance			1
she also had to find his hand and put it in a plastic bag before paramedics came to take mr @entity8 to hospital mr @entity8 has put the 7ft @entity27 he was building ( pictured ) on hold , but has started a new project : building a 32ft extension for his home amazingly , the inside of mr @entity8 's wrist bears just a few scars			1
there are hardly any signs of the accident , which occurred in may 2013 , on the back of his hand			2
now , he has even bought a new saw			2
he said : ' my hand was still on the saw before @entity13 went to fetch it so we threw that one away			2
' i bought another as soon as i could - i ca n't do my @entity23 without it			2
' @entity13 was n't too pleased			0
the whole experience has probably been more traumatic for her than me			0
' but it 's like falling off a horse , you need to get straight back on again			0
. ' ' obviously my granddaughters were worried when they found out even though they were very young			0
' the @entity27 is still waiting to be finished because i 've been busy with a much bigger project - the extension - but i 'll be onto it as soon as the weather picks up a bit			0
' i 'll just make sure i roll my sleeves up before i start			0
