the cost to taxpayers of refurbishing the @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity6 ’s @entity5 apartment has quadrupled – to £ 4million			1
building work on the 22 - plus room home has soared by £ 3million in the last year and includes the bill for @entity11 and @entity3 ’s new kitchen and several bathrooms , the @entity7 can reveal			1
the vast project has seen @entity15 , which had been used as office space since the death of @entity18 , transformed into a ‘ family home ’			1
renovations of the couple 's @entity5 flat have now reached £ 4million spectacular : the impressive @entity30 - also part of the @entity32			1
the royals will enjoy a new kitchen , several bathrooms and a new nursery for @entity37 thanks to the taxpayer @entity40 's treasure : @entity41 's @entity5 and its formal gardens			1
the royals will move in to @entity44 - which has been empty following the death of @entity18 although the couple are personally paying for all fixtures and fittings like curtains , carpets and furniture , the cost of building their new bedroom and even @entity37 ’s nursery has come from the public purse			1
one courtier last night insisted that the @entity5 project actually offered taxpayers ‘ great value ’ given the state of the crumbling apartment			1
but questions will be asked as to whether @entity64 , which has forked out for the refurbishment , is spending public money wisely			2
cuts to the @entity69 ’s funding led to a dramatic battle between courtiers and the previous government			0
senior officials – who admitted at one point that the monarch was down to her last £ 1million in the bank – accused ministers of leaving them with a £ 40million backlog of essential work to royal residences			1
just a few years ago @entity82 was almost hit by a piece of falling masonry in the crumbling courtyard at @entity64 , while staff are regularly forced to use buckets to catch the rain from its leaky roof			0
not extravagant : the @entity2 and @entity3 with @entity37 and @entity90 at their apartment window from above : the royal residence - with the @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity6 's apartment pictured in the foreground			1
a courtier insisted the renovations were ' great value ' given the scale of the project move : the royal couple , who used to live in @entity102 where prince @entity103 now resides , have spent millions transforming princess @entity18 's apartment following a comprehensive review of royal finances , the @entity69 now receives a @entity107 to spend as she wishes on her residences and official duties			1
the sum was £ 37.9million in 2014 - 15			2
the @entity7 understands that a ‘ significant proportion ’ of the money set aside for essential repairs and maintenance has been spent on @entity11 and @entity3 ’s new home			2
@entity116 have already questioned the use of money on private accommodation after discovering that £ 1million had been spent in 2012/2013			2
they were due to be told that the bill for @entity121 has spiralled to £ 4million , including @entity122 , when the @entity69 ’s accounts are laid before @entity124 on wednesday			2
but after being contacted by the @entity7 with the figures , @entity64 was forced to reveal details of the full cost			0
a spokesman for the @entity2 and @entity3 said the @entity5 is their ‘ one and only official residence ’ , where they will live for ‘ many years to come ’			1
but it was last refurbished in 1963 and needed a ‘ significant amount of work ’ to make it habitable again			0
he added : ‘ the work included significant costs for the removal of asbestos , the installation of a new roof , the complete overhaul of electrics and plumbing and a significant amount of internal building work to return the residence to function as a living space			0
facelift : renovation work is started on the central @entity41 building			0
following a comprehensive review of royal finances , the queen now receives a @entity107 to spend as she wishes on her residences and official duties external work : more renovations are made on the building			0
a spokesman for the @entity2 and @entity3 said the @entity5 is their ' one and only official residence ' , where they will live for ' many years to come ' ‘ to put it in perspective , there was n’t even any running water			1
’ because the palace is a @entity168 , the refurbishment had to be of a high standard to meet @entity171 guidelines			0
in 2012/13 initial internal refurbishments cost £ 600,000 and the renewal of the apartment ’s roof a further £ 400,000			2
it was indicated that further costs were to come , but nothing approaching the final bill revealed today			0
the couple , who also own @entity181 , a @entity182 country mansion given to them by the @entity69 , finally moved into the palace apartment last autumn after more than a year of building work			2
@entity186 , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , last night said the bill would not go down well with either @entity124 or the public			0
she said : ‘ this is money coming out of the public purse at a time of great austerity and i am doubtful whether this is something the public would endorse			0
former home : princess @entity18 in her drawing room - which @entity11 and @entity3 will now call home ' and with so many people of the same age struggling to get on the property ladder , trying to scrape together a minimal deposit , then you would have thought they would show more sensitivity			1
’ but the spokesman for the couple insisted that they had done everything possible to keep the costs down , adding : ‘ the @entity2 and @entity3 paid privately for all the internal furnishing , including carpets and curtains			1
they were also at pains to ensure that the specification is not extravagant			0
’ a @entity64 spokesman added : ‘ this is a major @entity217 project that is specifically being created , driven and owned by us , not them			0
it is essential they have a home and this needed to be made into one			0
‘ the vast majority of these costs have gone on simply trying to make it habitable again			0
