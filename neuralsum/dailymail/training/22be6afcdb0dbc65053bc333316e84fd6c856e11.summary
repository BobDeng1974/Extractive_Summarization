while the apartments may look like they have plenty of windows , many of them are fake			2
officials in @entity21 , in @entity19 province , have claimed that a series of ' windows ' have been pianted onto the side of the low cost accommodation for aesthetic reasons rather than to fool potential buyers			1
according to reports , the appearance of the block sparked internet rumours that the government was cutting corners in a bid to save money			1
others asked whether the construction company hired to build the government - subsided accommodation had cheated officials in order to increase its profits			2
but local officials said that the windows are just there for decoration and that the block conforms to building regulations			1
they added that the windows are only painted on to a part of the building which houses elevator shafts			0
it is not immediately clear , but fortunately for residents there are proper windows on the other side of the building			0
according to reports , the @entity21 municipal government claimed on its official @entity61 account wednesday night that they had ordered the construction company to rectify the ornamental windows , which have been ' misunderstood ' and caused an ' adverse social effect			2

it is hardly surprising that @entity10 authorities are cutting the odd corner			0
according to reports , new home prices across the country rose by 8.3 per cent in august and authorities have been trying to cool down persistently high property prices in recent years			0
perhaps creating homes with fake windows is their latest ploy			0
not so light and airy : fortunately for residents , some of the windows on the block are real			0

the buildings in @entity19 province had created an internet stir
some have *accused* the government of cutting corners to save money
but local officials say that the windows are for aesthetic reasons
