@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest instalment of his weekly column for @entity4			2
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			2
i was so proud to be @entity11 on saturday night in a small café on the high street of @entity14 in @entity15			1
i think our @entity17 team was superb			2
@entity19 has changed and evolved from his days at @entity20 and @entity21 to play an open , more expansive style of football to go through @entity24 in the middle and keep the passing on the grass			2
after his successful time at club level playing deep with two solid banks of four , i wondered whether @entity19 could change to suit a more open , expansive , possession - type game or stick with the old @entity17 way			2
at the final whistle i was disappointed sat there in my @entity17 shirt but i must say i was very proud of them and i think @entity19 deserves a lot of praise			1
cheer up @entity19 ! @entity38 deserves praise for the way @entity17 played , despite the defeat at this level with teams parking the bus and playing the formation 10 - 1 , you have to have full backs with pace and quality going into the final third			1
but on saturday night @entity51 and @entity52 never had the quality to penetrate and unlock the door			1
@entity51 was steady in possession but was unable physically and athletically to get into the final third			1
@entity52 got into the final third but technically , sadly for us , he is short			1
@entity19 will continue to play both these full backs but there will be a strong argument to pick the pace of @entity61 and the better technical ability of @entity63 , but that would be a gamble			0
falling short : neither @entity52 ( left ) nor @entity51 ( right ) could influence the match against @entity67 - there is surely an argument to bring in @entity63 ( below left ) and @entity61 instead what a questionable , diabolical decision to award that penalty to @entity73 ? @entity75 were comfortable and not under any threat and , with all the shenanigans of the @entity79 votes going to @entity80 , it certainly does make you wonder ... with more and more teams parking the bus , it ’s getting more difficult to score from open play			1
now teams get everybody behind the ball and defend in the 10 - 1 formation that @entity90 talked about			2
he was speaking at an @entity92 coaching course two years ago and he looked and smiled as he described the new formation , but i think he had it right			0
the mind - set is to defend deep , do n’t let teams get behind you , get wide players to double up with the full backs and use deep central midfielders to screen the defence			1
we ’ve seen similar at @entity103 with @entity104 using @entity105 and @entity106 in midfield against @entity108 in the @entity109 , but it did n’t work			0
but with that defensive mind - set , set pieces become important			2
super set - piece : @entity113 scored for @entity67 after @entity114 cleverly stepped over a corner on saturday @entity17 had nine corners but the @entity117 were first to every one			1
@entity17 never looked like threatening the first ball in the @entity117 box			0
instead it was the craft and skill of the @entity117 coach @entity123 that proved to be decisive			0
@entity67 ’s masterful short corner led to the first goal , with a quick pass to the edge of the box ‘ through ’ @entity114 finding @entity113 to smash it home			1
@entity131 were 1 - 0 up and cruising , dominating possession , shifting the ball along the grass with pace and precision			1
it was mesmerising and the @entity138 could not get near them			0
and then @entity142 strikes but , without a defender in sight , the keeper palms it wide from only 10 - yards out			1
it would have been 2 - 0 @entity131 and three points in the bag			1
within a minute of his miss the @entity138 equalised through @entity151 and now it looks like @entity153 for @entity131			1
turning point : @entity142 missed this chance to make it 2 - 0 to @entity131 - then @entity156 went and equalised ... this week i have been in @entity15 with the charity coaching for @entity159			1
organised through the @entity161 , we have done five days of coaching , helping the local coaches in the villages around the capital @entity14			0
always boiling hot , the whole city is covered in an orangey , dirty dust like something from a @entity170 movie			0
it ’s the third poorest country in the world but the local coaches are rich with enthusiasm			0
there is so much energy and willingness and the men and women taking part have the biggest smiles all day every day			2
they travel so far on motorbikes , if they ’re lucky , pushbikes or just plain walking to get here			0
and we ’re talking about miles and miles and miles			0
but their smiles and their happiness is so powerful			0
these people have no money but they are still so rich			0
i had the shock of my life at 7.30am one morning waiting for the @entity197 jeep to take me to the national stadium to start my day			0
leaning against the wall in the shade and , oh my @entity201 , right by my right elbow was a lizard as long as my arm			0
it ran past me missing my shoulder by inches and , i must confess , a visit to the loo was essential .			0

the way @entity38 ***'s*** men played made me proud
@entity52 and @entity51 did *n't* have enough quality in final third
set plays are crucial - look at @entity113 ***'s*** goal
@entity142 ***'s*** miss for @entity131 changed the match against @entity156
i *'ve* been in @entity15 with @entity223
