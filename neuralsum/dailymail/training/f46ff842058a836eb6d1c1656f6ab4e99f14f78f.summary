it appeared on 20 posters that showed up in @entity167 , @entity168 , in may when @entity7 traveled there to raise money			2

lightning rod : @entity7 ' may 2014 fundraising trip to @entity168 brought political jabs out of the woodwork , including this mocking poster a star is born : abortion rights activists packed the state capitol to congratulate @entity7 after her 13 - hour filibuster the wheelchair ad has attracted slings and arrows from both the right and left			1

the *commercial* *immediately* came under fire from conservatives as below the belt
@entity7 said monday the ad is ' about one thing and one thing only : it is about @entity4 's hypocrisy '
