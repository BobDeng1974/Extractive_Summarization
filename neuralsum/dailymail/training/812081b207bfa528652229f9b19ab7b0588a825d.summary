by @entity0 published : 09:04 est , 7 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:16 est , 7 november 2013 two detectives who dealt with a sex crime claim against @entity5 in 2008 have been referred to the police watchdog			0
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) said it has directed @entity8 to refer the conduct of the pair over their handling of the alleged indecent assault			1
a woman came forward in march 2008 to claim that disgraced television presenter @entity5 assaulted her in a caravan in around 1970 when she was in her early 20s			0
the @entity7 said it has directed @entity8 to refer the conduct of two detectives over their handling of the alleged indecent assault by @entity5 this was referred to prosecutors with three other allegations against the performer received by @entity21 , but in 2009 the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) decided no action could be taken			1
earlier this year , the @entity22 criticised @entity8 and @entity25 police forces for being ' unjustifiably cautious ' and failing to properly investigate the allegations			1
@entity27 found that ' had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach ' prosecutions could have been possible in relation to three victims			2
the two officers were referred to as @entity35 and @entity36 in ms @entity38 's report , and came under fire for wrongly telling the alleged victim that her claims would need to be corroborated before any prosecution			1
earlier this year , the @entity22 criticised @entity8 and @entity25 police forces for being ' unjustifiably cautious ' and failing to properly investigate the allegations			1
she withdrew her support for police action because she feared she would struggle to find the information they said they needed , for example contact details for people she knew at the time			0
ms @entity38 said : ' looking at the documents created in 2008 i found it difficult not to conclude that the officers had , even if unintentionally , dissuaded her from pursuing her allegation			2
' insofar as she was led to believe that " corroboration " was required before a prosecution could take place , this was wrong as a matter of law			0
' the woman told ms @entity38 that @entity36 had said court action would be difficult because @entity5 was a ' big celebrity ' , and that the officer told her the late @entity69 's wealth meant he would have top lawyers who would make ' mincemeat ' of her			0
a spokesman for @entity8 said : ' in february this year we received a request from the @entity7 , seeking relevant documents and our view on the potential for any police misconduct investigation , in relation to the 2008 sexual offence allegation against the late @entity5			1
' we sent a full response to the @entity7 in march and received a letter from them on november 1 requiring us to record a misconduct matter in relation to both officers referred to , and to refer it back to the @entity7 for their decision on how it should be investigated			0
' we will comply with that requirement and work with the @entity7 on any next steps			0
the two officers continue their normal duties in @entity8 at this time and have not been suspended			2

police investigators have asked @entity8 to refer conduct of pair
@entity100 said officers appeared to have ' dissuaded ' an alleged victim
earlier this year prosecutors admitted victims were *n't* taken seriously
