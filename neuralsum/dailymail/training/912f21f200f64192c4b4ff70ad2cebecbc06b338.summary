three babies have been declared @entity1 - free after being treated with a revolutionary new drug only hours after they were born			1
the fourth child only has ' a very low level ' of the virus after receiving the same treatment			2
the findings , to be announced at the @entity9 conference in @entity10 from july 20 , are a major breakthrough in the fight against @entity9 with scientists hoping it could lead to a cure if treatment his received early enough			1
four @entity18 babies have been cleared of having @entity1 after being born to hiv - positive mothers , due to being given a high dose of three different antiretroviral drugs it 's not yet known how old the babies are now but more is expected to be released when 14,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries descend on @entity10 to share their research and the latest scientific advances in the field			1
@entity9 2014 co-chairman , professor @entity30 , told the @entity31 that despite some people labelling the results as a ' cure ' , it can not yet be officially classed as one			0
' at the moment , the doctors do not know whether they are in fact cured			0
the only way they can tell is if they stop the @entity43 drugs and see if it comes back , ' professor @entity38 said			0
' we are excited about this though because all four received very early treatment after delivery , and when doctors tried to locate the virus they could find virtually no viruses in their systems			2
' these baby cases , and more cases amongst adults , tell us that if we treat @entity1 very early in some people were able to stop it			0
news of the four babies and their success stories comes only a year after the very first child to ever be ' cured ' of @entity1 was officially announced			1
' and in some people , maybe only 10 per cent or so who start treatment very early , it might even be safe for them to stop taking their drugs and their virus stays under control			0
however this is still a research question that needs to be addressed			0
' ' however you must keep in mind that the best way to stop babies getting @entity1 is to treat the mother during pregnancy , ' she added			2
after contracting the virus from their mothers , the four @entity18 - born children were given a high dose of three different antiretroviral drugs			1
news of the four babies and their success stories comes only a year after the very first child to ever be ' cured ' of @entity1 was officially announced			1
the baby , born in @entity86 in 2010 , and was cleared of any infection in 2013			2
the mother of the child only found out that she was infected with @entity1 during her labor and thus was not able to take precautionary action which could help her unborn child avoid infection			0
the major breakthrough will be discussed amongst a whole range of other new research at the @entity9 conference in @entity10 from july 20 - 25 according to the @entity98 , dr. @entity100 associate professor of pediatrics and a @entity1 specialist , gave the baby a three - drug antiretroviral therapeutic prescription , beginning the treatment when she was only 30 - hours - old - despite not having confirmation that the baby was infected at the time			1
only 29 days later , the virus could not be found in the infant 's system and did not return after the child stopped taking her prescription			0
however the four @entity18 children are yet to stop taking their treatment and doctors are unable to determine if the virus is likely to return if they do			1
in 2009 , an @entity119 man called @entity120 received bone marrow from a donor who was resistant to @entity1 and was later given the all - clear by a @entity126 hospital .			0

three @entity18 born babies have been declared @entity1 - free after receiving treatment *straight* after their births
the *method* was adopted by the doctors after a similar case led to an infant in @entity86 being cured of the virus in 2013
the major breakthroughs will be discussed at the @entity9 conference in @entity10 from july 20 - 25
