drivers are being ripped off by a postcode pumps lottery with 10p gaps between nearby garages , motoring groups have said - even as the prime minister warned retailers to pass on tumbling oil costs			1
@entity10 's remarks came after experts predicted the price of crude oil would continue to fall , having already dropped 40 per cent over the past six months			2
today average petrol prices dropped to 119.4p a litre , falling below 120p for the first time in four years			1
but as these photographs show , it depends where motorists choose to shop			0
@entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , charged 114.9p ( left ) while @entity32 at @entity35 's @entity34 services charged 127.9p eye - watering : the @entity37 service station in @entity38 , one of @entity35 's most expensive streets , was charging 179p a litre for unleaded today			1
in the past experts have blamed the road 's high rents a @entity32 garage at the @entity34 motorway services in @entity50 , north @entity35 , was charging 127.9p a litre for unleaded today - while just seven miles away in @entity52 , a @entity47 garage was charging 119.9p			1
just outside the capital in @entity30 , @entity31 , an @entity29 garage was charging 114.9p a litre for unleaded - almost matching the 114.7p - a - litre nationwide cap set by @entity57 today			1
@entity58 @entity57 ( various locations ) : 114.7p @entity47 ( @entity60 , north @entity35 ) : 119.9p @entity32 ( @entity61 , @entity34 ) : 127.9p @entity62 ( @entity38 ) : 179p @entity63 @entity57 ( various locations ) : 114.7p @entity65 ( @entity64 , city centre ) : 119p @entity29 ( @entity67 , @entity68 ) : 129.9p @entity69 @entity57 ( various locations ) : 114.7p @entity47 ( @entity70 , @entity71 ) : 119.9p @entity65 ( @entity72 ) : 121.9p @entity73 @entity57 ( various locations ) : 114.7p @entity74 ( @entity75 ) : 124.9p @entity32 ( @entity76 , @entity77 ) : 124.9p @entity78 @entity57 ( various locations ) : 114.7p @entity29 ( @entity79 , @entity80 ) : 120.9p @entity32 ( @entity82 services , @entity68 ) : 127.9p @entity57 has been leading the way with cuts – copied by its rivals – and the @entity86 said motorists were paying more in districts without a branch of the supermarket chain			1
@entity86 spokesman @entity91 said : ‘ it is a postcode lottery rip - off of winners and losers			0
‘ @entity35 and @entity95 have some maverick independents and non-supermarkets who are undercutting even @entity57 which is usually the price - cut leader			1
‘ @entity57 then lowers prices nationally and the other supermarkets follow to match them in towns where there is an @entity57			2
but where there is n’t an @entity57 , price falls take longer to arrive			0
’ despite the competition , it seemed some in @entity35 have been largely untouched by falling prices			2
at the @entity112 petrol station in @entity38 , @entity37 - one of @entity35 's most expensive streets - unleaded fuel cost an eye - watering 179p a litre today , a representative told @entity117			1
the petrol station appears to be an exceptional case			0
it has made headlines for its huge prices in the past and experts have blamed the enormous rent its owner has to pay			0
a staff member confirmed the cost to @entity117 twice - then said any concerns should be raised with the manager			0
but the pattern of varying prices was repeated across @entity133			2
@entity117 looked at five cities today and easily found petrol prices varying by between 7p and 15p a litre			1
among the more expensive were motorway service stations			0
in @entity78 , a @entity32 garage off the @entity68 just outside the city was charging 127.9p a litre - 13.2p more than the @entity57 petrol stations within the city			1
in @entity63 , the @entity29 garage at @entity67 on the @entity68 charged 15.2p more than @entity57 supermarkets inside the city			2
a @entity32 spokesman said it did not operate the garage pictured so had no control over the price , adding : ' prices at motorway sites are influenced by a number of factors , including rents typically being higher than at other forecourts , and increased maintenance costs due to increased traffic volumes , especially @entity157			1
' independent firms also lose out , however			0
independent garage @entity74 , near @entity73 , was charging 10.2p more today than an @entity57 superstore less than three miles away			1
according to price comparison site @entity163 , whose figures were compiled yesterday , there was a variation of 34.2p a litre in @entity168 , 25p in @entity35 , 14.2p in @entity72 and 9.2p in @entity169 - though the most overpriced garages were not revealed			1
price : petrol costs 120p a litre on average across the @entity133 , matched by this garage in @entity52 , north @entity35 competition in @entity177 was particularly fierce , and the motorists using an @entity29 station in @entity180 were paying only 112.9p a litre for unleaded			1
the @entity183 predicts prices will drop by at least 8p a litre for unleaded and by 6p a litre for diesel over the next fortnight			1
it found a number of 16p - a - litre differences between garages in the same area			2
@entity183 fuel spokesman @entity194 said : ‘ the price we pay at the pump is more likely to be affected by local retail dynamics than it is by distribution costs which are something of a red herring			0
' @entity171 tends to be driven by the presence of supermarkets keen to compete on price or an independent forecourt retailer determined to offer the cheapest fuel			0
‘ if a town does n’t have either of these , it can lead to motorists paying several pence a litre more than a neighbouring town just a few miles away			0
’ supermarket chains have been criticised by the main petrol firms in the past for selling fuel as a ' loss leader ' due to relentless competition			0
but despite the commercial tension there was variation too today among the big - name supermarkets , which have pushed down prices the hardest in a bid to retain trade			0
@entity57 clinched most of the cheapest prices , setting a cap of 114.7p a litre for unleaded across the country today - while most supermarket chains varied from branch to branch			1
the average price at @entity236 was more than 2p higher than @entity57 at 116.9p a litre , though it is due to drop another 1p tomorrow morning			2
falling prices : petrol prices have hit a four - year low , but the prices of crude oil have fallen much faster at the 800 of 1,000 @entity32 - branded sites which @entity32 operates , the average unleaded price was 119.0p			1
other retailers , including @entity247 and @entity29 , refused to tell @entity117 average pump prices for commercial reasons			0
however , @entity247 cut prices at all 500 of its filling stations by 1p a litre today			0
@entity10 this morning warned forecourts that he was keeping ' a close and watchful eye ' to see if they will pass on falling oil prices to motorists			1
' we need to be clear to the industry that we ’re keeping a close eye on this issue in terms of forecourt pricing , ' his spokesman said			2
' the government is going to keep a close and watchful eye on that sector			1
' it came after @entity269 , senior economist at @entity270 , described the recent slump in oil prices as a ‘ significant stimulus ’ to the economy which would benefit families around the country			2
giving evidence to the @entity278 , mr @entity269 predicted the price of unleaded petrol could fall another 15p to between £ 1.05 and £ 1.10 a litre			1
unleaded petrol prices fell to an average of 122.9p a litre last month and have dropped closer to 120p a litre since then , according to the @entity86			1
with wages stagnant , mr @entity269 told the @entity278 that ‘ the men and women of @entity133 will really notice things such as the sharp decline in oil prices			2
’ the value of @entity294 crude has tumbled 40pc since the june high of $ 115 a barrel as production in the @entity298 has surged while demand from faltering economies in the eurozone and @entity302 has fallen			0
oil prices have dropped to a five year low of just under $ 66 a barrel this week and rose to $ 66.4 yesterday			0
yet retailers - who have been criticised for not passing on enough of the savings to motorists - insist they are not to blame for persistently high prices			0
@entity10 warned petrol companies he would ' keep an eye ' on them a spokesman for @entity47 told @entity117 : ' prices are n't related to the crude oil price - they 're much more related to the cost of petrol and diesel which are sold as commodities in their own right			1
' so there are all sorts of factors including exchange rates , and then of course you 've got duty and vat on top of everything			0
we aim to be as competitive as possible			0
' @entity183 fuel spokesman @entity194 , however , maintained retailers should use the drop in costs to give the ' christmas present motorists have been waiting for ' at the pumps			0
' the wholesale prices of both petrol and diesel have reduced dramatically in recent weeks , so much so that there is room for petrol prices to come down by over 8p a litre and diesel by over 6p a litre in the next fortnight , ' he said			1
' we are hopeful motorists will see average petrol prices under 112p a litre , something they will not have seen since february 2010			1
if this happens the cheapest retailers will no doubt be selling petrol for well under 110p a litre , perhaps even lower			2
' prime minister @entity10 , chancellor @entity355 and the @entity357 governor @entity356 have all warned of the threat posed to the @entity133 recovery by problems in the global economy			2
but mr @entity269 said he was ‘ relatively optimistic ’ , adding : ‘ my own view is that people respond more to pounds and pence in their pockets rather than politicians warning about dangers lurking abroad			0
’ figures released yesterday showed the @entity133 economy is still growing at a steady pace , despite a surprise decline in manufacturing			0
latest forecasts from the @entity373 suggest the economy grew 0.7pc in the three months to november , unchanged from gdp of 0.7 per cent in the three months to october			0
but manufacturing contracted 0.7 per cent between september and october .			0

garages across the country still show huge variations in petrol prices
@entity57 set @entity133 cap of 114.7p - earning it cheapest prices almost everywhere
but independent garages and motorway services still nudge near 130p
one garage in @entity37 , @entity35 , said it was charging eye - watering 179p
mr @entity10 said he was keeping ' a close and watchful eye ' on petrol costs
a leading economist has predicted prices will drop as low as 105p a litre
unleaded petrol fell to 122.9p a litre last month and is set to drop again
