by @entity0 published : 15:34 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 16:55 est , 2 may 2013 wedding dress re-sale site @entity2 has released a @entity3 for former brides who want to figure out how much their used dress is worth			1
the calculator estimates a gown 's worth based on the label , date purchased , price paid and other characteristics like whether or not the dress was cleaned			1
' the calculator is a starting price that we consider to be " fair value " for a seller 's gown given all of the factors that we know influence a sale price , site creator @entity12 tells @entity21			1
celebrity fans : @entity25 's crystal - encrusted @entity24 wedding dress is for sale for $ 30,000 on @entity2			1
the steep figure is a relative bargain - the original price tag was $ 85,000 she typically recommends that a used gown be priced at 50per cent of its retail value - if it is less than two years old , has been cleaned and is in great condition			1
designers like @entity37 and @entity38 can fetch slightly more than 50per cent , while custom work can be harder to recoup in a sell			0
styles worn by celebrities are especially coveted though			2
' @entity43 's , @entity44 , @entity46 's @entity45 and @entity47 are still quite popular , ' ms @entity12 says			2
and some stars even use the site to buy and sell their gowns			2
@entity51 famously paid $ 58,000 for her @entity53 gown on the site , and currently for sale is @entity25 's @entity57 - encrusted gown from the ' @entity58 ' video ( original price , $ 85,000 ; selling for $ 30,000 ) the average selling time is 70 days , though some dresses sell within 24 hours			1
and while some brides still sell because of cancelled weddings , @entity12 says there is a growing trend to pass the dress on partly because the bride wants someone else to experience the same joy			1
but does it work ? i tried the calculator on myself - and a few other brides - to find out			0
blowing the budget : @entity0 re-sold her $ 17,900 @entity77 gown for $ 7,500 ' any future daughter of mine will think my @entity37 is a yellowing meringue monstrosity ! ' the bride : @entity0 the wedding : september 21 , 2012 at the @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 the dress : @entity37 @entity77 original price : $ 15,900 calculated value : $ 9,306 sold for : $ 7,500 @entity89 says : people have commented that it 's ridiculous to put something on my body that costs more than a used car , and i agree			1
i wanted a bottle of tequila and @entity98 , but my husband was dead - set on a larger wedding for friends and family and generously offered to foot the bill			0
my @entity104 was customized with sweetheart neckline , a seven - foot cathedral train and beadwork			0
the retail price was $ 25,000 , but i paid $ 15,900 and cut a deal with the seamstress to do the customization separately for a total of $ 17,900			0
i loved wearing my dress , but was equally happy to box it up afterwards			2
i know that in rare cases women can pass their dresses down , but i thought it far more likely that any future daughter of mine would think it looked like a yellowing meringue monstrosity - and i wanted to get some of the money back ! i did n't have the calculator , but with the price point and custom work i knew that i was catering to a very specific buyer			0
luckily i found her - the woman who bought the dress has now become a friend , and i 'm actually going to her wedding in @entity132			2
so the cathedral train will actually get to see the inside of a cathedral ! buyer 's remorse : @entity137 could n't return her @entity139 dress ( as seen on the catwalk ) ' my twenties - style @entity139 gown was a mistake i could n't return ' the bride : @entity137 the wedding : october 20 , 2012 at @entity145 in the @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity85 the dress : @entity139 's @entity150 dress original price : $ 5,000 calculated value : $ 4,500 sold for : $ 3,000 @entity153 says : ' it was a mistake dress			1
' i was under pressure to pick one and i went to a number of bridal shops and this was the first dress that did n’t look like a meringue			1
' i had my doubts from the moment i went home and i called them the next day to say i wanted to change it from white to cream and they said i should wear white – they did n’t let me change			0
then i found my dream dress			2
' when i found out i could n’t cancel i started looking for ways to sell it			0
' i did n't know about the price calculator , i just figured that i would knock $ 1,000 off and someone would be thrilled			0
' mrs @entity137 sold the dress to a ' sweet ' bride planning a @entity177 / flapper theme and says that she will attend her wedding next year			2
something old : @entity179 sold her @entity181 dress for an impressive $ 1,400 ( posed by model ) ' i was never going to wear the dress again ' the bride : @entity179 the wedding : june 12 , 2012 at the @entity186 in @entity187 the dress : the @entity190 dress original price : $ 2,000 calculated value : $ 900 sold for : $ 1,400 @entity193 : ' i decided to sell my wedding dress because i knew that i was never going to wear it again and it would just sit in a closet somewhere			0
by selling the dress , someone else could enjoy the dress as much as i did			1
' i do n't know any details about the [ buyer 's ] wedding , but i do know that she is a fairly young bride just graduating college this year			0
' ' it was expensive , so getting some of the money back makes sense ' the bride : @entity211 the wedding : january 12 , 2013 the dress : @entity216 & @entity217 's @entity215 gown original price : $ 1,700 calculated value : $ 765 sold for : $ 895 financial incentive : @entity211 spent $ 1,700 on her @entity216 and @entity217 gown , so was keen to get some of that money back ( posed by model ) @entity225 : ' not only is it beautiful and magical and i would love for someone to wear it again , practically , it 's expensive , so getting some of the money back makes sense			1
' also i do n't believe that the reason people keep their gowns , 20 years down the road my unborn daughter would wear it , makes any sense at all fashion wise			0
' mrs @entity211 sold the dress to a bride who was the same size and , since designer wedding gowns normally have to be ordered six months in advance , was under time pressure .			0

selling one 's bridal gown is a growing trend , *inspired* both by financial incentive and the influence of celebrities like @entity25 , whose dress is currently listed on the site
