by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:38 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 03:49 est , 14 january 2014 parents are losing control over what youngsters watch , experts have warned parents are losing control over what youngsters watch , experts warned yesterday			0
this is because tablets , phones and computers allow their children to see violence and pornography without their knowledge			1
children as young as 12 are viewing vile and often illegal websites with their friends using the new technology which parents can not track – although some would argue that parents should be stricter about leaving their children to view content unsupervised			1
this has left a generation desensitised to the obscene language and sexual images which have become the ‘ wallpaper ’ of children ’s lives , said a report for the @entity35			1
parents said they worried about what children aged ten to 15 were now able to view using phones , tablets such as @entity41 and computers - – even though in many cases they bought the devices for them			1
they also expressed concern about the surge in sleepovers , which often have little adult supervision and allow children to watch films their parents would not approve of			2
children were also seen as desensitised to the sexualisation of young women			1
the @entity35 report said : ‘ for many parents , technology is in the hands of the young and the balance of power within the household has shifted			1
’ the @entity62 has campaigned for an opt - in system of filters			0
the scheme , slowly being rolled out by the internet giants , would mean adults would actively have to ask for the household to have access to x-rated websites			2
researchers for the @entity35 questioned 10,000 people – including teenagers – about the viewing habits of young people , for the report to accompany its new guidance on film classification			1
children are viewing often illegal websites with friends using new technology like @entity41 the @entity35 has also announced plans to clamp down on raunchy music videos in the @entity85			1
videos made featuring artists such as @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 could be targeted following the large - scale public consultation			0
the body said there are ‘ special worries ’ about sexual content in music videos			2
the vow to crack down on the videos came as the @entity35 released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch			1
in its report it noted : ‘ a specific issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content , where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of girls , and pornography			1
‘ the content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries			0
’ it also said the ‘ sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern ’			0
‘ music videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery , which parents believed to be potentially harmful to young girls ’ emotional wellbeing and social development , ’ the report said			1
‘ the overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity			0
’ ‘ parents are working hard to maintain control , yet feel that the tide of information and challenging content can sometimes be against them , ’ the report said			0
‘ by age 15 , most parents argued that it was “ game over ” and they could no longer control their child ’s viewing			0
they were fairly pragmatic about the way in which their children were viewing films – online , at friends , illegally downloading			2
’ the fears raised in the report were echoed by @entity156 mp @entity155 , chairman of the @entity158 culture , media and sport select committee			0
‘ now so much viewing is done online			0
all it requires is for the viewer aged 15 to know what the parental lock password is and it ’s very easy to get around , ’ he said			0
‘ it is perfectly true that most children over 15 are very familiar and literate with digital distribution online and therefore for parents to control it is much harder			0
’ the @entity35 report said that because children are now able to watch films using portable devices on their own in their rooms or with their friends , ‘ childhood years and their innocence are felt to be under threat with children being exposed to age - inappropriate content ... at an earlier age than ever before ’			1
the results support the findings of the @entity187 review in 2011 , which said : ‘ children are under significant pressure to grow up at a faster pace than ever before			2
mothers of girls were particularly sensitive to the increasingly sexual and sexualised culture that their daughters are growing up in and worry about the long - term impact on their development			0
’ bad language was also a big concern with the shock value of four - letter words diminishing with each generation .			2

tablets , phones and computers allow children to see violence and pornography without their knowledge
children as young as 12 are viewing vile and often illegal websites
left a generation desensitised to the obscene language and sexual images
findings are in report by the @entity35
