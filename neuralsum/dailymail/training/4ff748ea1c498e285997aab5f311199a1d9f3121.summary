by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 14 november 2013 viewers of @entity4 word game @entity2 were left gasping when it hit a peak with a near - the - knuckle answer			2
letters chosen during one round of the long - running show were capable of spelling the word ' orgasmed ' , with the eight - letter contribution then displayed by the programme ’s @entity13 who posed next to it			1
contestants had to find the longest word possible from the selection of nine letters which had been chosen - e , a , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 satisfactory result : @entity13 next to the eight - letter word ' orgasmed ' on popular quiz show countdown the best efforts by the players were the six - letter ' grapes ' and seven - letter ' grasped ' in the edition of the afternoon show screened yesterday			1
but the team in dictionary corner - lexicographer @entity36 and impressionist @entity37 - were able to come up with something better			1
@entity37 suggested : ' there ’s a seven ( letter word ) in " dampers " , another one , and @entity36 " orgasmed "			2
” show host @entity43 responded : ' oh , well done			1
' @entity44 @entity36 and impressionist @entity37 were able to come up with the eight - letter answer cheeky : impressionist @entity47 barely suppresses a smirk as he comes out with the cheeky answer @entity52 - recently a contestant on @entity54 ’s @entity53 - then arranged the letters on the board to spell it out			1
' @entity58 ' has had multiple appearances , occurring in the final as the series climaxed three years ago when @entity62 was the presenter			0
in 2010 the hosts of the long - running show were left with red faces when the f - word popped up by surprise			2
@entity52 cringed as the letters @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , e all came up in the contestant 's selection - and host @entity62 gave a wry smile			2
flustered : show host @entity43 responded : ' oh , well done			1
very good ' viewers sat with bated breath in case the two contestants decided to go for the obvious six - letter word - and trigger a flood of complaints			1
but instead of putting the six letters together for the ancient @entity85 expletive , the contestants went for ' caged ' and ' faced '			0
later that year @entity2 raised giggles again when producers settled on a very suggestive final word scramble			0
eyebrows were raised on the afternoon show when the clue letters spelled out ' @entity92			0
' and again in 2010 tv bosses had to axe a round after a contestant offered up an expletive during filming of an edition			0
competitors were given @entity100 , but they were given a new set of letters and asked to try again when @entity104 student @entity103 produced the word ‘ s * * * face			0
dictionary corner expert @entity36 told presenter @entity62 the term for a ‘ rude or obnoxious person ’ would have been acceptable			1
however the station decided it was not suitable and a fresh selection of letters was used			0
@entity4 said at the time : ‘ countdown is a daytime programme and this particular word was not deemed appropriate for a daytime audience so not included in the show			0
’ a racier version of the programme - 8 out of 10 @entity119 does countdown - has recently been screened on friday evenings with more adult themes .			0

dictionary corner reached ' orgasmed ' after *grappling* with *conundrum*
comedian @entity47 helped reach seven - letter answer
impressed host @entity43 said : ' oh , well done . very good '
