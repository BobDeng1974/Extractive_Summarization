she opted for a pair of loose - fitting tartan leggings , which she teamed with a wax overcoat and a long black tunic			1
she chose to go make - up free for the oaccasion , even apparently neglecting to style her normally luscious mane of hair as she walked the streets in west @entity2			1

talking about her sense of style , @entity32 , who is widely recognised as @entity49 ’s greatest ever ballet dancer , recently said : ‘ do n’t get me wrong , when i dress for an evening out , i like to go the whole way			0
‘ i know some people worry they ’re going to be overdressed , but when i go out i do n’t care			0
it ’s odd because i live on stage in costumes and yet i never want to dress down			0
‘ my grandmother used to wear these really high , elegant @entity58 stilettos well into her 70s , and i thought she looked great , whatever her age			0
i know i ’ll always make an effort , and to look as glamorous as my grandma would be my ideal			2
