@entity1 studios and tv firms have long tried to persuade us that donning a pair of @entity6 glasses will improve our tv and movie experience			1
however , researchers have shown they are a waste of money - and that we have exactly the same emotional response whether footage is in @entity14 or @entity6			1
researchers monitored palm sweat , breathing and cardiovascular responses such as heart rate in a bid to see if @entity6 was worth the extra cash			1
however , researchers have shown they are a waste of money - and that we have exactly the same emotional response whether footage is in @entity14 or @entity6			1
researchers looked at several measures of emotional state in 408 subjects , including palm sweat , breathing and cardiovascular responses , such as heart rate			2
these measures are commonly used to gauge emotional responses			0
four film clips were chosen because each prompted one discrete emotion intensely and in context without viewing the entire film			2
study participants viewed a @entity6 and 2 - @entity48 clip of approximately five minutes of each film : ' @entity50 ' ( fear ) , ' @entity45 ' ( amusement ) , ' tangled ' ( sadness ) and ' @entity54 ' ( thrill or excitement )			1
participants were randomized to view the films in a design that balanced the pairs of films watched , in which format , and order of presentation			0
the increased visual realism of 3 - d films is claimed to offer viewers a more vivid and lifelike experience — more thrilling and intense than 2 - @entity48 because it more closely approximates real life			0
researchers at the @entity71 wanted to see if the claims were true			0
author @entity73 said the results suggest that as an entertainment medium , @entity6 may not provide a different experience from 2 - @entity48 , insofar as evoking emotional responses go			1
' we set out to learn whether technological advances like @entity6 enhance the study of emotion , especially for young patients who are routinely exposed to high - tech devices and mediums in their daily lives , ' says @entity73			2
' both 2 - @entity48 and 3 - d are equally effective at eliciting emotional responses , which also may mean that the expense involved in producing 3 - d films is not creating much more than novelty			0
researchers found that @entity6 is a waste of money - and that we have exactly the same emotional response whether footage is in @entity14 or @entity6			1
' further studies are of course warranted , but our findings should be encouraging to researchers who can not now afford @entity6 technologies			1
' this could also be good news for people who would rather not wear 3 - d glasses or pay the extra money to see these types of films			0
' the results , published recently in @entity107			0
the study aimed to validate the effectiveness of @entity6 film , a newer technology , as compared to 2 - @entity48 film that is currently widely used as a research tool			1
film clips are used in psychological and neuroscience studies as a standardized method for assessing emotional development			2
because it is less invasive than other methods , it is especially useful when studying the emotional responses of young people for whom emotional well - being is critical to healthy development			0

four film clips were chosen because each prompted one discrete emotion intensely and in context without viewing the entire film			2
the only difference was seen during a thrilling scene from ' @entity54 ' in 3 - @entity144 researchers believe that could be because the @entity6 content of the film is of especially high quality , with more and a larger variety of @entity6 effects than the others			1
study participants viewed a @entity6 and 2 - @entity48 clip of approximately five minutes of each film : ' @entity50 ' ( fear ) , ' @entity45 ' ( amusement ) , ' tangled ' ( sadness ) and ' @entity54 ' ( thrill or excitement )			1
participants were randomized to view the films in a design that balanced the pairs of films watched , in which format , and order of presentation			0
the complex configurations allowed the researchers to compare not only emotional responses , but effects of format and viewing order on the results			0
taken as a whole , the results showed few significant differences between physiological reactions to the films			0
when accounting for the large number of statistical tests , only one difference was seen between the formats — the number of electrodermal responses ( palm sweat ) during a thrilling scene from ' @entity188 clip			0
the researchers believe that could be because the @entity6 content of the film is of especially high quality , with more and a larger variety of @entity6 effects than the others .			1

researchers monitored responses to a *series* of @entity14 and @entity6 clips
only @entity203 film @entity54 was found to cause a difference
