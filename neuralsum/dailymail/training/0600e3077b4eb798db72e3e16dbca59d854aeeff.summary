@entity5 became infuriated with @entity6 , 48 , and his wife @entity7 , who moved into their dream home in @entity10 , @entity11 , eight years ago			1
rubble , car parts , plastic sheeting , wood and old tyres soon built up in the back garden of the family home and a red @entity20 appeared abandoned on the front lawn , a court heard			1

planning officers at the authority agreed it was not the ' amenity value ' expected on a modern estate , with the amenity comprising of bedroom views from five houses which overlook the family ’s back garden			1
the council planning department gave mr @entity6 six weeks to tidy up in june 2013 – or provide a valid reason not to			1
after ignoring their order six months later he was summoned to court for failing to comply with section 215 of the @entity51 , requiring him to maintain land			2
he was handed a criminal conviction by @entity54 ’ court in march and appeared at @entity56 last thursday to appeal the decision			1
in his hearing mr @entity6 said he , rather than his wife , was solely responsible for the garden : ‘ for me my garden is perfect			1
my wife does not like it , but i paid for this house and i paid for this garden			1
‘ it is a building site at the moment , but in a year ’s time it will be the best garden in @entity10 with a sauna and a @entity70			2
’ he said his trouble began in 2010 when he fell out with his neighbours over building in his garden and the enforcement notice was their revenge			2
pizza delivery driver @entity77 , 48 , was fined over £ 3,000 for his untidy garden he said first they complained about the size of his shed then they moved on to the state of his garden			1
he said they had put up decking to use their garden more and the complaints followed			2
mr @entity6 said he had complained about their noise and flood water caused by the decking into his garden , but was told by the council they were civil matters			1
‘ my neighbours hate me , ’ said mr @entity6			2
i am not angry with the council officers , they are only doing their job			2
i can only be angry for the hateful neighbours			0
’ he said he accepted the frequent visits by the council officers to check on him , and admitted he had put up a sign saying ‘ no photography ’ pointing to his neighbours over the back fence			2
he added : ‘ i will soon be putting it back ’			0
he protested about the council officer ’s visit to his wife , who is a dentist , at work in @entity109 with the letter saying he , rather than her , was responsible			2
he said : ‘ it is my private house			0
no one else can see it			0
only @entity116 can see it from their satellite			0
i am not throwing away good stuff			0
i am building a 2m deep pit for compressors in my shed			0
’ he told the judge : ‘ i am not a silly or stupid person			0
i did not receive the letter so i did not comply with it			0
if i had received it , i would not agree , but i would ask them what to do			0
’ council planning officer @entity129 , who drafted the enforcement notice with the council ’s legal department , said he had attended mr @entity6 's property and told him of neighbours ’ complaints , but on one occasion mr @entity6 had appeared confrontational			1
he said they had acted on neighbours ’ complaints in october 2012 and had given him repeated warning the matters were being taken seriously			0
he said the council had given mr @entity6 a list of things it wanted doing , including the moving of rubble , car parts and metal into existing buildings and the removal of the @entity20 from the front lawn and six week to do it			1
mr @entity129 told the hearing : ' in our view the state of the property was harming the amenity of the area '			0
‘ the neighbours had to look at children ’s bikes , old broken tools , building materials , wheels , tyres , car parts and a vehicle trailer up against a wall			0
‘ a small red @entity20 is parked on the lawn which was seen as they went past every day			1
it is an open plan estate , the car was next to the road and highly visible ’			0
a red @entity20 appeared abandoned on the front lawn of the four - bed house , @entity56 heard ‘ @entity183 is a small cul - de - sac with five houses , all built tightly overlooking each other and all looked into each others gardens			1
‘ each item on its own was not illegal , but the total effect could affect residential amenity			0
‘ we do n’t serve notices on people who have temporarily parked a car on a lawn			0
serving a notice is a last resort			0
’ asked by the judge if mr @entity6 could have avoided complaint by pulling a huge tarpaulin over his lawn , mr @entity129 said if the council were to receive a complaint the tarpaulin was unsightly , and he viewed it was harming the local amenity , they would serve a notice			1
recorder @entity207 , @entity209 , said mr @entity6 had shown in court he could be confrontational and he was in no doubt council officers had served the correct notice on him			1
he said he had evidence of car parts , rubble , bikes tools and drums in the garden and of the neighbours ’ concerns			0
‘ there is ample evidence the notices were served correctly on mr @entity6 , ’ said @entity221			2
‘ we accept the evidence mr @entity129 explained the situation to him through a number of visits			0
’ he said the appeal had failed and the magistrates ’ fine of £ 2,299 still needed to be paid			1
he ordered a further £ 720 in costs for the crown appeal hearing – totalling £ 3,019			2
recorder @entity207 told mr @entity6 his claims to afford only £ 60 a week , from his part - time job as a delivery driver , was ridiculous : ‘ you ca n’t live in a large house like this and afford a sauna and a @entity70 with an income of £ 60 a week			1
you will pay £ 150 a month			0
‘ if you do n’t , there are consequences for you			0
’ mr @entity6 protested he wanted to appeal and be given a transcript of proceedings and he was ordered to be quiet or face leaving by the cells for being in contempt .			1
