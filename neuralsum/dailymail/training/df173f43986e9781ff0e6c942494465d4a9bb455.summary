the current @entity0 international week being the last for four months will sharpen minds at the @entity2 over if and when to extend manager @entity4 ’s contract which runs until 2016			1
only a few months ago there was significant criticism of the @entity2 for giving @entity4 a deal until @entity8 in @entity9 , ahead of what turned out to be a dismal @entity0 showing at the @entity11			1
yet such is the speed at which the football calendar turns that the draw for the 2018 @entity11 qualifying competition takes place in @entity17 next july			2
@entity4 's contract as @entity0 manager runs out in 2016 after the @entity20 the decision to keep @entity4 on came after a poor showing at the @entity11 in @entity23 in the summer and it is always an uncomfortable situation when an @entity0 manager has to give his views on fixtures when he might no longer be in charge of the team — as happened with both @entity31 and @entity32			1
there are those on the @entity2 board who believe the @entity0 manager should be judged from tournament to tournament with no need for the long - term contracts , such as the bewildering six - year agreement the @entity40 have given head coach @entity41 ahead of the @entity42 on home soil			1
but by the time the @entity2 delegation arrives in @entity45 next summer , @entity0 might have already secured their place in the @entity48 and with no obvious successor — especially with @entity51 ’ stock falling — the @entity2 could easily award @entity4 two more years			1
the @entity2 say they have yet to decide who will go to @entity17 and have no intention of talking about @entity4 ’s contract			2
@entity4 's side face @entity56 and then @entity57 at the weekend , and then have a four - month break @entity51 ( right ) is one of few possible candidates to replace @entity4 as @entity0 boss the @entity2 , who take birthday celebrations very seriously , have already started planning for the 50th anniversary of the @entity11 win in 2016			1
but the great difficulty for the @entity2 will be avoiding the landmark developing into another inquest of why there has been no repeat during 50 years of hurt			0
the initial thought is to focus on the whole tournament , including @entity74 ’s involvement , rather than just @entity0 ’s isolated victory			0
the @entity2 have already started planning for the 50th anniversary of the @entity11 win in 2016 @entity76 , former @entity2 chairman who would have always travelled at the front of the plane with the @entity0 team , was spotted back in the economy seats on a @entity82 flight last week			1
@entity76 , who had been desperate to carry on at the @entity2 past the limit of his 70th birthday , is now chairman of the @entity87 board of trustees and admirably did n’t want to waste his charity ’s funds on business - class travel			2
@entity91 steps in to stop the @entity93 player @entity92 ( right ) swapping his shirt with the @entity95 meanwhile , the football memorabilia lots including @entity98 and @entity99 ’s @entity11 winning medals being auctioned on tuesday were close to having @entity101 ’s shirt from the 1966 @entity11 quarter - final which he swapped with @entity95 @entity103 despite manager sir @entity91 calling the opposition ‘ animals ’			1
but agents acting for @entity103 , who previously loaned his prize possession to the @entity109 museum , could not agree a price			0
@entity112 's botched planning for the autumn international series was not limited to decimating the @entity114 for commercial gain			2
the new ticket scanners were so unreliable that large queues formed outside and a considerable number of fans missed the @entity120 and anthems until gates were opened to allow them in manually			0
the @entity40 said the glitches will be sorted out before the @entity126 game			0
the ticketing system at @entity112 for @entity0 's clash with @entity129 had a few problems no @entity11 for @entity131 @entity132 are expected to win main @entity134 radio rights for the @entity135 after protracted talks , that have gone on for over a year with the @entity138			1
that will be a relief for those who had to put up with the unintelligible @entity142 as chief pundit on @entity144 in @entity129 in 2011			0
his station are likely to receive the secondary news update rights package			0
meanwhile , @entity11 broadcasters @entity148 , who have loaned @entity151 rugby talent in the past , are now reportedly more impressed with the way @entity153 cover the sport			0
an unlikely wearer of a @entity158 winner ’s ring , while watching @entity159 dominate @entity160 in @entity163 ’s @entity162 game , was @entity164 ’s chief executive @entity155			0
in a previous life , @entity155 was kicker for the @entity166 who beat @entity168 21 - 0 in 1991 .			0

@entity4 's contract as @entity0 manager runs out in 2016
the decision to keep @entity4 on came after a poor show at the @entity11
@entity0 face @entity56 and @entity57 and then have a four - month break
it is not *inconceivable* that @entity4 could be kept until 2018
@entity51 is a candidate to replace @entity4 but his stock is falling
the @entity2 have already started planning for the 50th anniversary of the 1966 @entity11 win in 2016
the ticketing system at @entity112 had problems at the weekend
