not quite as famous as ‘ one - nil to the @entity0 ’ was in its day , granted			2
but one - nil is ‘ the @entity3 ’			2
it ’s the margin via which , according to the scorer @entity6 , @entity5 regained self - esteem and belief by winning at @entity9 in 2007			1
beating @entity10 , to those who were charged by @entity12 with installing a ‘ new ’ form of play , put @entity5 on the map again , @entity6 told me			1
@entity17 and @entity18 both followed months later — old foes , bogey teams			2
one - nil , one - nil			0
@entity22 capped his @entity5 debut with the winner against @entity25 on friday night one - nil , the scoreline , against the @entity27 which saw @entity5 booed out of the country before @entity29			1
one - nil , the scoreline which gave them a technical knockout against @entity33 in the @entity34 a couple of weeks later — narrow margin , total control			0
@entity38 , @entity39 , @entity33 , @entity40 — four games , four goals , four clean sheets			2
one - nil to @entity5 , world champions 2010			1
they had it within their repertoire to hit threes , fours , fives			0
but the single - goal win was a trademark			0
own the ball , own the midfield , get the advantage , never look like conceding			0
but , friday night in @entity55 at the beginning of @entity57 ( @entity57 ) was something different			1
one - nil over @entity25			1
a record 97th international match without conceding for ‘ @entity62 ’ @entity61			0
a debut goal , after only 38 competitive minutes , for @entity22			1
in touch with @entity66 leaders @entity67 , who are the next home opponents — in @entity68 in september			0
the bare bones look good			0
the full x-ray much less so			0
@entity22 has all the hallmarks of an old style centre - forward who finishes on another night , one of those ‘ accident nights ’ which hit every team every so often , @entity5 would have lost this one			1
on another night , @entity77 would have had a hat - trick			2
on this night , there was the sight of the @entity81 , for whom the game left ‘ a bad taste in the mouth ’ , throwing his hands up in the air at the naivety and imprecision of the second half and roaring at his team : ‘ what are you playing at lads ? ’ transition			2
it can be a glorious , strategic , rewarding process — or an unmanaged , inglorious , frustrating decline			0
quite where @entity5 are in that process is debatable			1
for seven years between 2007 and 2014 , they dictated			0
but , just as when all dictatorships are overthrown , the subjects have had a good time stamping on the statues			0
@entity104 in the @entity34 , @entity40 at the @entity105 — @entity5 were to be bullied , pushed around , made to chase , pressed to within an inch of their lives			1
the striker has struck up a ' thing ' with @entity110 at @entity111 but there ’s no doubt that renovation is afoot			1
@entity115 , @entity117 ’s gem of a midfielder , should have been at the @entity105 , should probably have been a starter			1
@entity120 , dynamic , aggressive , intelligent — the heartbeat of an @entity123 side which won the @entity125 title and came within seconds of winning the @entity126 — is now a fixture			0
debuts have been given to @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , while everyone waits for @entity134 and @entity135 to get fit			0
yet @entity5 , @entity137 ’s reigning champions , are fighting for their dignity and automatic qualification from this group because they could not control a 1 - 1 situation in @entity142 last year			1
they are sore and should be contemplating this midweek ’s friendly against @entity40 with queries in their minds because they could neither augment , nor control , friday night ’s 28th - minute lead against a @entity25 side which at first came to defend and play on the break			1
then , sniffing glory , piled runners forward through the @entity5 midfield , robbing possession and launching assaults on @entity61 ’ goal			1
it all makes the scorer much more interesting			0
what @entity5 require , even above some restored arrogance and self - confidence , even above key players avoiding injury , is for a prolific striker to emerge			1
@entity22 has also been likened to @entity117 and @entity18 striker @entity165 in @entity167 ’s day , his goals patched up the fact that @entity5 did n’t have a world - class @entity169 , but not great			1
when @entity172 and @entity173 took charge they would , regularly , add the goal or goals which gave sense , confidence , and purpose to @entity5 controlling play via @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity6 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185			1
@entity129 — if @entity81 accepts that more direct , more vertical football , quarter - backed by @entity188 , is central to the renovation — may become vital			0
meantime there ’s @entity22 — once of @entity117 , lately of @entity111			1
his former @entity117 mentor , @entity192 , himself a mighty forward , recently said that @entity22 , whose debut goal on friday was more valuable than it was beautiful , was ‘ part van @entity195 , part @entity165 ’			1
it ’s meant to mean that he has the direct no 9 repertoire which accounts for his 32 goals for @entity5 at junior levels and his tournament top - scoring performance last time @entity206 won the @entity208			1
@entity40 's @entity195 is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time equally , it speaks of his awareness of space and how to profit from it			0
‘ sometimes you have to really “ love ” football to understand strikers , ’ he says			0
‘ to understand , or spot , their movements behind strikers , the process of “ opening up a defence ”			0
‘ some people ca n’t see it			0
some think that if you have n’t scored you ’ve not had a good game			2
right now , first - touch , fluid , strategic football is in fashion — the old style centre - forward who finishes but is static is a vanishing species			0
if you do n’t have much more to your game , you wo n’t play			0
’ when he did get to play he chose the @entity235 7 for his back			0
with @entity5 , just like at @entity237 , that ’s a special number			1
it belonged to @entity167 , record scorer until along came @entity240 — now @entity5 ’s record scorer , and not formally retired			2
‘ i dream of scoring my first goal for @entity5 , ’ @entity22 said on thursday			1
then : ‘ i was angry at myself for missing an earlier chance , so i did n’t really celebrate when i scored , ’ he told me on friday evening after the dream arrived			2
at @entity111 , he has struck up a ‘ thing ’ with @entity110			2
‘ he never looks up when he hits you a first - time pass , but you learn			0
’ just as he did against @entity25 to sprint onto @entity120 ’s volley - pass			2
some of @entity5 ’s transition will be played out through the talents of this guy			2

@entity22 scored on his @entity5 debut against @entity25 on friday night
the @entity111 striker had scored 32 goals for @entity5 at junior levels
former @entity117 mentor @entity192 said he was ' part @entity254 , part @entity264 '
