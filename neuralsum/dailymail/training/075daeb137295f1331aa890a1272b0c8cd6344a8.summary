published : 12:49 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 14:58 est , 20 july 2013 today 's start - up names make @entity2 sound sedate and quaintly old - fashioned			1
and with around 252 million domain names registered across the internet , they 're set to get more outlandish			1
wacky spellings , portmanteau words and inexplicable suffixes like ' ify ' or ' sy ' ( think @entity9 and @entity10 ) abound in the quest to find an unclaimed url			0
in this era , when every business must have an online presence , the quest to obtain a short , memorable dot - com web address is chief			2
what 's next : @entity20 is short , catchy and not a real word - therefore a perfect start - up name , while the founder of @entity24 , a screen sharing platform , felt that @entity26 lacked personality name game : @entity29 was so named because its founders could n't afford to buy @entity31 from its owner but that 's no mean feat when there are so many million domain names currently registered across the @entity36			1
the solution ? inventing words to register your domain name and avoid paying millions for a properly - spelled , concise url			1
as an example , the rights to the url investing.com sold for about $ 2.5 million last year , according to the @entity43			2
start - ups , by their nature , are usually big on ideas but low on funds			1
one now - established business that faced a financial challenge when finding a name is @entity53			2
the original : @entity2 is now buying blogging platform and fellow oddly - named business @entity53 for $ 1.1 billion cash , announced ceo @entity58 in may growing : since its launch in @entity62 , @entity59 has grown into 20 other markets around the @entity64 when @entity66 and @entity67 had the idea for a photo - sharing site in 2004 , they decided to call it @entity71 , but the domain name was taken and the owner refused to sell it to them			1
they settled for @entity29 and the rest is history			2
the @entity43 reports that @entity79 was originally @entity79 in 2006 - the domain name for @entity79 was taken and the company 's co-founder @entity81 did n't think they could afford to buy it			2
' we assumed it would be too expensive , ' he told the @entity43			0
soon enough , though , @entity79 took off , and the company was able to ' buy the vowels '			0
one mathematically - minded @entity89 entrepreneur was trying to come up with a name for his data - science consulting business and finding the options slim			0
so @entity93 , 30 , wrote an algorithm to generate all the pronounceable combinations of letters , three syllables or fewer , whose dot - com addresses were n't already claimed			0
' i was too frugal to want to pay for an [ existing ] domain name , ' he told the @entity43			0
he got 700 options out of his algorithm and was tossing up between @entity103 and @entity104 when a poll of friends and family overwhelmingly voted for @entity104			0
@entity93 could now afford a much more conventional name - @entity104 has been backed by a number of @entity111 investors , and @entity113 co-founder @entity112 is its chairman - but with that kind of success , why would he want to ? @entity117 : @entity118 , a sing - along story book company , is a mixture of ' music ' and the @entity123 word for book ' biblio ' game changr : @entity53 's misspelling has become part of its cache the naming of start - ups and products is such big business that companies exist solely for the purpose of finding the perfect name			1
@entity136 , founder and presumably name - designator of @entity138 , a name - consulting business , says today 's start - ups are going the wrong way about choosing their business names			1
' the primary driver for start - up naming right now is the misguided mission to find the shortest possible , pronounceable [ unclaimed ] dot - com address , ' @entity136 told the @entity43			1
he says short urls are n't the be-all and end - all and that start - ups are underestimating their potential customers if they assume people wo n't respond to a longer business name and website			1
@entity154 , a name and tagline developer , agrees			0
' a short name is n’t always the best name , ' she writes at her blog @entity159			0
' your url does n’t have to be your name : the web address of @entity164 , a design agency in @entity165 , is notclosed.com			0
ca , and the many country - code domains that can be employed in creative ways			2
' bought vowels : the @entity172 offices of @entity79 are well - appointed now , but when it first launched as @entity79 , the social media company could n't afford to buy its vowels @entity176 also points out that ' quirky ' names are n't a recent phenomenon			2
you only have to walk down the processed snack - food aisle at the supermarket to see that start - ups do n't have a monopoly on crazy names ( think @entity185 , @entity186 , or @entity187 )			1
nevertheless , in the challenge to come up with a short name that conveys meaning , and is easy to pronounce and logical to spell , start - ups are certainly the leading the kooky - name pack			1
@entity194 's tips for founders naming their start - ups advises the use of prefixes and suffixes , as in bitly , @entity9 and @entity200 , creating compound words or portmanteaus , like @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity59			1
or , simply misspell a word , as @entity53 , @entity205 and @entity206 all have			0
if that all fails ? make something up - think @entity209 and @entity210			0
@entity194 recommends using lots of vowels to add rhythm to the name			0
or , just ask @entity104 if you can borrow his algorithm .			0

start - ups are becoming known for their quirky names
businesses such as @entity29 are so - named because the correctly - spelled domain name was taken
there are 252 million domain names registered - so start - ups are becoming ever more creative
