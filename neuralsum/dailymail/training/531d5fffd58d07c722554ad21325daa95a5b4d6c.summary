by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 10 january 2013 two of @entity3 ’s supermarket giants have locked horns after @entity5 reported a surge in sales but @entity8 ’s disputed the figures			1
@entity5 , the @entity3 ’s biggest retailer , said takings for the six weeks around @entity11 were up by 1.8 per cent on the year before			1
however , @entity8 ’s claimed the rise , the biggest for three years , was an exaggeration			2
improvement : @entity5 recorded its best @entity11 figures for three years , with like - for - like sales up 1.8 per cent the attack – evidence of an increasingly bitter battle between the two – was swiftly dismissed by @entity5 as a ‘ smear ’			1
@entity8 ’s pointed out that @entity5 ’s figure included sales made through vouchers given to shoppers under its clubcard loyalty scheme			1
an email from @entity8 ’s said the 1.8 per cent figure was ‘ disingenuous ’			1
but even without the voucher sales , at 1.4 per cent @entity5 ’s rise was ahead of the 0.9 per cent at @entity8 ’s for the same period			1
significant investment : @entity5 has taken on an extra 8,000 staff and launched its @entity35 range shoppers buying food and drink online for @entity11 gave @entity5 a particular boost , with website sales up by 18 per cent			2
' more to do ' : @entity5 chief executive @entity40 is trying to reverse the fall in profits recorded by the chain last year more than half a million food orders were fulfilled in the week before @entity11			2
the sales surge follows a £ 1billion action plan by @entity5 to refurbish stores , employ 8,000 more customer service staff and launch new ranges			2
these included @entity35 budget products , which along with upmarket @entity52 outperformed other ranges			0
the latest figures are a stark contrast with a year ago , when @entity5 revealed a @entity11 sales slump of 2.3 per cent and its shares lost almost £ 5billion in a day			1
while @entity8 ’s executives launched a series of briefings to accuse @entity5 of massaging the figures , the boost surprised the @entity63 , bringing a 3 per cent rise in the share price yesterday			1
@entity66 , of consultants @entity67 , said : ‘ after a listless 2012 , the empire strikes back			0
' with like - for - like sales growth jumping to its highest level for three years , @entity5 has come out fighting			0
' the £ 1billion invested in revamping stores and boosting customer service is finally delivering a handsome return			0
’ @entity5 chief executive @entity40 said : ‘ i am pleased with our performance over the important @entity11 and @entity79 period in the @entity3			0
’ but he added : ‘ whilst our seasonal performance is encouraging , there is a lot more to do			0
’ some analysts were cautious , suggesting it would take further improvements to demonstrate the company , which takes £ 30 of every £ 100 spent in supermarkets , has seen a permanent return to growth			0
boost : @entity5 shares opened 3 per cent higher today after the sales figures surpassed expectations			0

@entity5 records 1.8 per cent rise in like - for - like sales over the *festive* period
it follows the 11.6 per cent slump in profits to £ 1.66 billion revealed last year
@entity8 *'s* claims the 1.8 per cent figure is an exaggeration
