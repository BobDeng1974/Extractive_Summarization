a former @entity1 prison worker today recalled the moment a group of schoolchildren were torn to pieces by a pack of guard dogs then buried alive by his colleagues			1
@entity9 , who worked as a guard for eight years until he fled the country in 1994 , recalls the day he saw three dogs get away from their handler and attack children coming back from the camp school			1
' there were three dogs and they killed five children , ' the 45 - year - old told @entity21 through a translator			1
the two other children were barely breathing and the guards buried them alive , ' he said , speaking on the sidelines of a @entity37 conference for human rights activists			1
the next day , instead of putting down the murderous dogs , the guards pet them and fed them special food ' as some kind of award , ' he added with disgust			1
' people in the camps are not treated as human beings ... they are like flies that can be crushed , ' said @entity52 , his sad eyes framed by steel - rimmed glasses			1
the former guard is one of many defectors who provided harrowing testimony to a un-mandated enquiry that last week issued a searing , 400 - page indictment of gross human rights abuses in @entity1			1
@entity62 : this drawing by another prison guard who defected comes with the description : ' in this position , called " pigeon torture " prisoners are reportedly beaten on the chest until the vomit blood ' menacing : @entity1 dictator @entity74 should face international justice for a catalogue of appalling crimes against humanity , @entity73 investigators have			1
above , a woman soldier at a camp in @entity1 after fleeing the country two decades ago , @entity52 worked for years at a bank in @entity83 but gradually got involved in work denouncing the expansive prison camp system in the isolated nation			1
three years ago , he quit his bank job to dedicate all his time to his non-governmental organisation , @entity89			0
' it 's my life 's mission to spread awareness about what is happening in the camps , ' he said			2
there are an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in @entity1 , a nation of 24 million people			2
@entity52 , who today is married with two daughters , knows all too well the brutal mentality of the camp guards			1
purged : @entity103 , in the blue boiler suit , is escorted from the court to be executed for treachery			0
it was initially reported that he was killed by a pack of dogs , but a @entity1 diplomat he was shot by firing squad when he , as the son of a high - ranking official , was ushered onto the prestigious path of becoming a guard in 1987 , he says he was heavily brainwashed to see all prisoners as ' evil '			1
at his first posting at camp 14 , north of @entity119 , he was encouraged to practice his @entity121 skills on prisoners			2
and he recalls how guards were urged to shoot any prisoner who might try to escape			0
' we were allowed to kill them , and if we brought back their body , they would award us by letting us go study at college , ' he said			0
some guards would send prisoners outside the camp and kill them as escapees to gain access to a college education , he added			1
@entity52 said he had beaten many prisoners but said that , to his knowledge , he had never killed any of them			2
@entity1 leader @entity74 ( centre ) applauds during the 8th conference of @entity142 of the @entity143 in this undated photo released by @entity1 's @entity145 today ruthless : @entity74 had his uncle killed because he was guilty of ' tremendous crimes against the country ' , according to the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity150 although he witnessed numerous executions , starving children , and the effects of extreme torture , it was not until he was promoted to be a driver , transporting soldiers back and forth between camps , that he began to question the system			2
during his travels he sometimes struck up conversations with prisoners and was astonished to find that ' more than 90 percent ' of them said they had no idea why they were in the camp			0
@entity52 had stumbled across @entity1 's system of throwing generations of the same family into prison camps under guilt - by - association rules			1
he got a taste of that rule himself			0
on leave in 1994 , he returned home to find that his father had committed suicide after making some drunken , negative remarks about the country 's leadership			0
reports that @entity1 leader @entity74 had his uncle executed by throwing him to a pack of dogs spread like wild fire across the world last month			0
however , it later emerged the claims had apparently originated as a satirical post on @entity190 microblogging website which was picked up by a @entity192 - based newspaper			0
@entity1 's ambassador to the @entity150 , @entity193 , also denied the allegations , saying they had been put about by the hermit state 's enemies			0
@entity193 confirmed the dictator 's former political confidant and close relative @entity103 had been executed for ' tremendous crimes against the country '			0
he said the 67 - year - old had been killed by firing squad , a fate that media outlets said was normally reserved for ' traitors '			0
@entity52 's mother , sister and brother were detained and likely sent into camps , although he is not sure what became of them			1
though @entity52 returned to work , he feared he too would be dragged off			2
so he drove his truck to the shores of the @entity214 and swam across to @entity190 , having to dump the heavy weapons he was carrying to avoid drowning			0
once he got involved in the @entity218 work in @entity83 , he was uneasy about meeting former prisoners who had also managed to defect , like @entity220			0
@entity220 was sent to @entity221 -- where @entity52 once served -- with his whole family when he was nine and spent 10 years there to repent for the suspected disloyalties of his grandfather			2
@entity52 remembered him from his time as a guard there			1
but @entity220 , like most survivors , understood he had not chosen his job and had accepted his plea for forgiveness			0
' he met me with a gentle handshake , ' @entity52 said			2
last week 's @entity73 report was vital to spreading awareness about the reality of the camps , @entity52 said , comparing what is happening there to the @entity241 - era @entity240			1
' the difference is that in @entity1 we are still talking in the present tense			0
these horrors are still happening , ' he said .			0

@entity9 said three dogs attacked five children from camp school
@entity250 died instantly , but other two were buried by guards still breathing
dogs were then petted and fed ' special food ' as a *reward* , claims guard
@entity52 said : ' people in prison camps are treated like flies that can be crushed '
among defectors who have given *evidence* to @entity73 probe into rights abuses
