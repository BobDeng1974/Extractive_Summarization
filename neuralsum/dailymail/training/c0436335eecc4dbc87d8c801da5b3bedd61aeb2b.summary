he has fought through this incredibly well			0
‘ when the doctors said they could n’t see any of the tumours anymore , it was such a relief			1
to think that he has fought off 27 tumours is just incredible			2
’ @entity1 first started being unwell last summer whilst on a family holiday to @entity30 with his mum and sister @entity31 , four			1
miss @entity33 said : ‘ he woke up one morning whilst we were on holiday and he just could n’t seem to get his balance			0
the following day he had a high temperature and i thought he had picked up a virus so i took him to the doctors there			1
‘ they said he was just teething and we were due to fly home later that day so we got on the plane and came home			0
when we arrived home he was screaming so much in pain and it was n’t like him so i took him straight to hospital			0
’ when he got to hospital doctors x-rayed him to see if he had broken any bones , which he had n’t , so he was sent home again			2
but he carried on getting worse			0
miss @entity33 took him back to the doctors another six times , and each time he was sent home after she was told it was just a virus			1
she said : ‘ i knew there was something wrong with @entity1 , but each time the doctors sent him home insisting it was just a virus			1

she said : ‘ i was at my wits end by then			0
@entity1 was just lifeless in my arms and whimpering			1
they had a terrible time trying to get blood out of him as his blood was just clotthing immediately			0
initially they thought he had a bone infection , so they kept him in			0
’ but then tests revealed that he had cancerous cells in his body			2
they broke the devastating news to @entity33 that @entity1 actually had cancer			1
covered : the scan revealed he had 27 tumours , the only parts of his body not affected were his hands and feet relieved : his mother @entity22 , 26 , took him to the doctors six times			1

it was the biggest shock of my life			0
i just could n’t take it in			0
‘ all those times when i ’d taken him to the doctors and they ’d said it was just a virus			1
when all along he ’d been fighting cancer			2
’ a scan revealed the terrible extent of his disease			2
tumours were raging all around his body			1
miss @entity33 said : ‘ i nearly fainted when i saw his full body scan photos			1
it was just a mass of black everywhere			0
it was in his bones all over his body			2
the only place where there were no tumours were his hands and feet			1
’ @entity1 started chemotherapy straight away			1
he had ten weeks of intensive treatment then he had operations to remove a tumour in his adrenal gland and one on his lymph nodes			1
then he had his own stem cells removed , followed by high dose chemotherapy treatment again			0
then he had a stem cell transplant			0
now after his massive battle , there are no sign of the 27 tumours			2

@entity22 said : ‘ we ca n’t believe he has done so well			2
there is a possibility of the cancer coming back so we are fundraising to take him to @entity145 for treatment that is n’t available over here			2
‘ he has done so well so far , and we want to give him every possible chance in the future which is why we are fundraising to take him to @entity145			0
' family : @entity1 , pictured with his four - year - old sister @entity31 , developed the symptons last august while on holiday neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts			1
it usually starts in the child 's abdomen , often developing in the adrenal glands above the kidneys			0
it can then spread to other areas such as the bones , liver and skin			0
the cancer affects about 100 children in the @entity169 each year and is usually diagnosed in under - 5s			1
it is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours			2
the symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread			0
initial symptoms often include aches and pains and loss of appetite			0
the most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child 's abdomen			0
other possible symptoms are a lump in the child 's neck , bone pain , weakness in the child 's lower body , anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin			0
because the early symptoms are vague , the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body			1
the outlook is better if the child is younger and the cancer is slower growing			0
it is common for the cancer to return after treatment and treatment tends to be less successful in older children			0
