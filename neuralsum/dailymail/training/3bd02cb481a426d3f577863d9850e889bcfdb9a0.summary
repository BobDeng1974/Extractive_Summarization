this is a good - looking city - even in chilly , thickly grey december			1
@entity3 's cyclists are out in stylish force , despite the icy temperature			1
there is not a @entity8 - clad limb in sight and barely a helmet			1
women pedal in heeled boots and snug woollen hats			1
no one locks their parked bikes			2
i have n't a clue how they find them outside the @entity20 , where there are hundreds to choose from			2
all is bright on the harbourfront : @entity3 's @entity24 district is a popular corner of the city ' it is @entity29 culture , ' says my non-danish taxi driver , shrugging his shoulders			1
this must be why many of the men maintain beards , and stalls by smart @entity24 canal do a brisk trade selling knitted accessories			1
i am exploring on foot , with frequent stops for potent gluhwein or piping coffee and those delicious open sandwiches on chewy brod everyone eats in @entity47			2
@entity3 is expensive , especially in winter , when you ca n't help but be drawn into a cosy cafe , glowing restaurant , bustling pub or twinkly shop			1
the city is decked out prettily - most famously at the @entity54 ( billions of lights , whooshing rides , wooden chalets and fireworks on a friday )			2
a place for reflection : the city 's @entity54 have a magical quality once the dusk descends but it is not warm , so we only glimpse it through the glittery gates			2
meanwhile , our hotel , the eco-friendly ( do n't let that put you off - it is comfortable , except for the dishcloth - like bath towels ) @entity74 , is around the corner offering complimentary tea , cake and hot wine in the sheepskin - swagged lobby			2
staying here , it is difficult to muster your get - up - and - go - particularly after the healthy but hearty breakfast buffet , where you can opt for raw fennel salad with scrambled eggs			2
but peel yourself away , because there is much to see and do			2
in the evening you need n't venture far			0
@entity90 , an industrial looking fish bar , is in the nearby meatpacking district and serves freshest fish with a twist - cauliflower , moss and granola sauce anyone ? you can combine culture with shopping at the @entity100 , where @entity101 ! is on until january 11 , celebrating the centenary of the birth of furniture designer @entity104 , who believed design could help to ' frame ' a good life			1
best wheels forward : @entity3 is a city of cyclists - if you can remember where you left your bike the sleek 2213 sofa he made for his own home is known as the ' embassy sofa ' because it is said to be found in almost every @entity29 consulate around the world			1
there is plenty on show by another world - renowned @entity29 , @entity121			0
his design philosophy ' we shall play - serious play ' is evident in his chairs : they are universally beautiful while being practical			0
take the famous @entity128 chair with its flattened spindles , which are far more comfortable than the traditionally rounded versions			0
the shop sells design books and geometric paper decorations by the @entity3 company @entity134			1
look in on the @entity135 on the same street , @entity137			0
its sleet - grey marble interior is magnificent , and itsdome rivals @entity141 's @entity140			0
for further inspiration , there are plenty of desirable design shops in streets around the @entity148 ( also known as the @entity149 )			0
lighting up our lives : @entity3 is fabulous during high summer , but has a twinkling quality in the winter @entity154 has an artistically curated collection of @entity157 - style pieces and an elegant @entity159 sofa in a deep bottle green ( please , @entity161 )			1
@entity162 and you 'll arrive at the neat @entity164 , a 17th - century palace			0
this is also a good spot from which to admire the surrounding streets , their houses painted in brick reds and warm greys			0
in the nearby @entity173 you will find six museums ( including the castle , where you can gaze at the crown jewels ) and - i am thrilled to report - at least one red squirrel			0
the @entity179 houses the @entity29 art collection of tobacco manufacturer @entity181			0
it is a compact gallery with some lovely pieces			0
the works from @entity186 , @entity29 's northernmost beachside town , where artists such as @entity188 congregated to paint outdoors , capture the long summer days and light dancing off the water			1
there are antique shops and tempting jewellers @entity194 on @entity195 , next to the @entity181			0
come in : @entity3 's shops - especially on the commercial drag of @entity198 - have a year - round allure and the tastiest sandwich of my trip in @entity203 on @entity204 , nearby			1
with toppings such as salmon and pickled fennel or @entity29 blue cheese with plum gel and roasted hazelnuts , you can almost forgive the price tag ( around £ 6 a slice )			0
they offer punchy home - brewed schnapps , which will send you back into the cold with a swing			1
the interior is quietly elegant , with pearly marble pendant lights and dainty porcelain tea cups by @entity222			0
like the rest of @entity3 , it looks effortless			1
or perhaps that 's the trick			0
rooms at the @entity74 start from £ 105 a night room only ( www.guldsmedenhotels.com )			0
air @entity228 flies to @entity3 from £ 58 return ( www.norwegian.com ) .			1

@entity3 is famed for long summer nights , but is also alluring in winter
a visit during the cold months allows for lazy *afternoons* in its cosy cafes
the harbour district of @entity24 is a popular *enclave* abuzz with restaurants
