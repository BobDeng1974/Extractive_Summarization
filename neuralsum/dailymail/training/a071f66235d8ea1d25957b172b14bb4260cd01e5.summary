with no official rankings or recommendations contained in the report , the final decision by the 15 - member board was also subject to political , emotional and sentimental factors			0

though there 's still a chance wrestling could be spared depending on a september vote by the @entity3 , @entity21 says ' seeing the hardship baseball has been through , i am not too confident			1
' he adds , ' i do n't think we have heard the end of this			0
' beginnings : @entity248 , whose father @entity144 won possession of the universe through a wrestling match , is depicted here wrestling with the @entity255 giant @entity254 on this pottery dating back to 515 or 510 bc legacy : images of two men wrestling on a @entity260 dated to 1813 are seen here , with the sport found dating back to more than 7,000 years ago @entity262 : this stadium in @entity265 , @entity263 is where the ancient @entity7 and the @entity266 , the women 's games in honour of @entity270 , were held the @entity3 executive board will meet in may in @entity273 , @entity110 , to decide which sport or sports to propose for 2020 inclusion			1
the final vote will be made at the @entity3 session , or general assembly , in september in @entity280 , @entity281			1
