@entity0 says @entity2 referee @entity1 did not show a yellow card to the wrong @entity5 player in wednesday 's @entity7 game against @entity8			1
reports of @entity5 's 2 - 1 win suggested @entity1 should have sent off @entity11 by showing the @entity12 defender a second yellow card for his 77th - minute foul on @entity8 forward @entity15			2
instead , @entity16 was booked in what was widely reported - including by @entity8 's official website - as a case of mistaken identity			0
the referee , in his first season at @entity7 group - stage level , also sent off two @entity8 players .			0

@entity2 referee @entity1 intended to book @entity16 for dissent
it was widely reported he meant to book @entity11 a second time
but he did not feel @entity32 's shirt - pull warranted a second yellow card
