the @entity0 has suggested that they may consider rolling out their own digital currency at some point in the future			1
they highlighted the importance of digital currencies like @entity6 , and say it could become as common as modern banknotes			2
but they warn that there are a number of problems - and if consumers flocked to digital currencies , it might leave high street lenders devoid of customers			1
the @entity0 has suggested it could ' mint ' a digital currency			1
in a discussion paper it highlighted the benefits of currencies like @entity6 ( shown )			1
it said this could eradicate the need for a third party - a bank			2
but a central bank would still be needed to regulate the currency one of the benefits of using digital currencies is that a third party - such as a bank - is not necessarily needed to complete a transaction			1
this reduces some of the steps needed to securely transfer money - but the @entity0 notes that a means of controlling the digital currency would still be needed			1
@entity6 is a distributed peer - to - peer digital currency that functions without any central authority , such as the @entity0			1
the currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers			0
@entity6 can be bought with near anonymity , which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy			0
but critics say that also makes @entity6 a magnet for drug transactions , money - laundering and other illegal activities			0
however , a huge jump in value of @entity6 in 2013 allowed some to reap huge rewards			0
for example a @entity6 investor , @entity59 @entity58 , made more than half a million pounds in 2013 after he forgot he bought £ 17 ( $ 26 ) of currency four years before			0
‘ the emergence of private digital currencies ( such as @entity6 ) has shown that it is possible to transfer value securely without a trusted third party , ’ said the @entity0 in a discussion paper			1
they added that while existing private digital currencies ‘ have economic flaws which make them volatile , ’ the process through which @entity6 are ‘ minted ’ shows promise			2
this is known as the blockchain , where computers must work out the next line in a sequence of code with increasing difficulty to release more bitcoins			0
there is no process of actual minting , though - rather , the entire system relies on the steady progress of computers to ‘ mine ’ bitcoins and release them into the market			0
but a system would need to be devised that allowed a digital currency like this to be controlled			0
in a scenario where a digital currency is proposed by the @entity0 , the @entity0 would create its own digital currencies , and make them available just as they do with banknotes			1
the @entity0 highlighted the importance of digital currencies like @entity6 , and said it could become as common as modern banknotes ( stock image shown )			2
but they warn that there are a number of problems - and if consumers flocked to digital currencies , it might leave high street lenders devoid of customers ‘ there are several different ways in which a central bank might make use of a digital currency , ’ the @entity0 said			1
‘ it could be used as a new way of undertaking interbank settlement , or it could be made available to a wider range of banks and @entity118 [ non-bank financial institutions ]			0
‘ in principle , it might also be made available to non-financial firms and individuals generally , as banknotes are today			0
’ in a tweet the chancellor @entity124 said : ‘ good that @ bankofengland looking into digital currencies - need to ensure @entity129 customers benefit from new tech. ’ the @entity0 notes there are a number of unanswered questions about digital currencies that need to be answered before it can be rolled out			1
these include the impact they would have on existing payment systems , and how regular bank would compete with digital currencies			0
the @entity0 warned that consumers may choose to hold all their money in electric money , rather than using high - street lenders , if it ultimately proved successful			2
and they have not yet put a timeline on when a @entity6 clone could be introduced .			0
