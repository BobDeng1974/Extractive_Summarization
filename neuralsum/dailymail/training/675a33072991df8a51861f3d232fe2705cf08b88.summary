by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 13:32 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 19:14 est , 4 june 2013 restaurant customers ought to order smaller plates of chips , the government 's recycling advisers declared restaurant customers ought to order smaller plates of chips , the government 's recycling advisers have declared			1
they say that too many people leave cold fried potatoes uneaten on their plates - and as a result hundreds of thousands of tons of food waste each year have to be dumped by pubs , restaurants and fast food chains			1
they called for waiters to be trained to tell customers they ought to have less chips , and for ' stealth menus ' designed to encourage diners to go for lighter meals			1
the campaign against chips was launched by the @entity27 , a £ 30million - a - year quango set up to encourage more recycling			1
its verdict that restaurant meals are too big and people ought to have fewer chips on their plate came just a day after a committee of mps told families to stop eating meat on a daily basis			1
the @entity41 said people should eat less pork , lamb and beef because the country is never more than a few days away from a food shortage and because of the need to cut the amount of food thrown away			2
the @entity27 recommendations on chips were greeted with hostility by the restaurant trade , which said it was impossible for waiters to tell customers to order short portions , because the customers would think the restaurant was trying to short - change them and diners would resent the implication that they were too fat			1
@entity63 of the @entity64 said : ' it 's just not on			0
the customer is going to think the waiter is making a rude suggestion			0
' @entity27 - which is financed by the @entity69 - based its chips verdict on a large - scale survey of more than 10,000 people			1
it also ran a more detailed survey of over 5,000 people and 12 focus groups			0
they called for waiters to be trained to tell customers they ought to have less chips , and for ' stealth menus ' designed to encourage diners to go for lighter meals it found that people go to restaurants either to fuel up on food or for a social occasion , and that just over a quarter of them leave food on the plate			1
most of these were young women , the survey said			0
it added : ' the main dish and the accompanying sides were the courses most likely to be left ; while the appetisers , starters and desserts were less likely to be left			0
' the staple foods that tend to get left at the end of the meal are chips , vegetables and salad			0
' chips , vegetables and salad are seen by some customers as plate fillers rather than part of the meal they ordered			2
some do not even consider these food types , especially salad garnishes , to be intended for consumption			0
' it said that the food most often left on the plate was chips and that 32 per cent of people who leave food leave chips			1
the survey quoted people who said they regarded chips as ' extras ' and one man who said : ' i always leave the grass			1
' @entity27 said that to solve the problem ' eating venues could train their staff so they are better able to talk about portion sizes with customers and provide more information on the meals , for example ingredients , cooking			1
' as the research findings suggest , portion sizes can , at times , be a sensitive subject so discretion and skill need to be used when communicating relevant information to customers			0
' menus might offer different - sized meals and dishes which ' would give customers more choice and empower them to order the right amount			2
' but the document , @entity156 , warned : ' any messages or communication initiatives developed need to be stealthy and subtle , as diners do not want to be told what to do when out enjoying themselves nor do they want to think about food waste when eating out			1
' they said that too many people leave cold fried potatoes uneaten on their plates - and as a result hundreds of thousands of tons of food waste each year have to be dumped @entity171 menu suggestions made by the @entity27 research include portion sizes marked by three chillies , by numbers of scoops , by different sized plates , or by a three bear system in which different - scale meals would be called mummy bear , baby bear and daddy bear			1
however mr @entity63 , who runs @entity183 in @entity184 , central @entity185 , said : ' our waiters have to ask people what side orders they want			2
if they then ask if people want a smaller portion , customers are going to think we are trying to get away with giving them less			2
' then people will start thinking we are trying to tell them they are overweight			0
' soon we will have @entity195 saying we are being rude to the customers and trying to cheat them			0
recommendations for smaller portions are just not something that can come from the waiting staff			0
' @entity27 's annual budget from @entity69 reached £ 80million a year in the mid- 2000s when the body was given a major role in persuading local councils to abandon weekly rubbish collections and replace them with fortnightly bin rounds and compulsory recycling			2
however it was blamed for helping create a backlash at the polls against councils who stopped weekly collections after it published a controversial series of recycling recommendations			0
these told councils to introduce fortnightly collections only in winter so there would be fewer unpleasant smells in the early months , and not to bring them in close to an election so that voters could not register a protest			0
its budget is now down to £ 30million and has been under review in the early months of this year .			0
