afforded his first @entity3 start of the season , @entity1 outcast @entity0 took just three minutes to serve his case for more regular inclusion			1
in fact , so far has @entity0 fallen in the pecking order at the @entity11 , the @entity8 star has collected a @entity14 winner ’s medal in the time since he last took part in a @entity18 match from the outset			2
but in @entity20 on tuesday night he reminded manager @entity21 of his merit , arrowing home a ferocious drive with his first opportunity to put @entity1 on their way to a 4 - 1 victory over @entity28 – the strike clocked nearly 80mph			1
@entity0 hammers home @entity1 's opener early on against @entity28 on tuesday night @entity0 only offered a muted celebration after his first goal having made a rare start for @entity1 his celebration , rather muted and moody , said much of his state of mind right now – this is what i can do , boss , any chance ? it was his aggression which then paved the way for @entity1 ’s second goal and , just for good measure , he crowned the win in the final minute , bookending a fine performance with two goals			1
that effort , though , left an impression , bursting from deep , swapping passes with a team - mate before coolly slotting into the bottom corner			2
this time , it evoked a smile			0
the goal was about skill , about desire , about proving a point given the platform to do so			0
the @entity8 forward coolly slots his second goal past @entity28 goalkeeper @entity62 just last month , a frustrated @entity0 groaned : ‘ i have to speak to [ manager @entity21 ] @entity21 because the situation at the moment is not good for me because i have to play , so we will see what happens			1
‘ i am happy at @entity1 and happy in @entity68 but the only thing is i do n’t play			2
i do n’t get the chance to play			0
i play always 10 to 15 minutes			0
i can not be happy with this			0
’ all the while , @entity1 have struggled and @entity21 ’s position remains under intense scrutiny			2
summer signing @entity75 has carried the @entity77 for much of the campaign , without his 14 goals @entity21 could well have been chased out before now			0
@entity75 is finding the back of the net every 133 minutes – there is only one player on the books with a better ratio this term , and that man is @entity0			1
@entity0 has a better goals - per - minute ratio this season than any other player on @entity1 's books @entity0 , 29 , has scored 31 goals in 55 starts for @entity1 in the last two - and - a - half years @entity0 applauds the travelling @entity1 fans at the end of the match @entity98 pleased with ' dangerous ' @entity1 in the 300 minutes made up largely of second - half cameos and , of course , his 90 in @entity102 , the 29 - year - old has scored three times			1
indeed , from a total of 55 starts for the club , he has plundered 31 goals			1
that return makes for better reading than any of his offensive colleagues in north @entity68			0
yet still , @entity21 appears not to trust a player who has won 121 caps for the world champions			0
the @entity115 boss maintains that the former @entity117 forward is not for sale in january and , after his exploits in midweek , admitted he was playing at a ‘ strong level ’			0
strong enough for a start ? with @entity21 in such a weak position right now , perhaps it is time to turn to @entity0			2
@entity0 celebrates @entity8 's @entity14 win in july with @entity117 star @entity124			1

@entity0 scored twice in @entity1 's 4 - 1 win over @entity28
@entity0 has scored 31 goals in 55 starts since *joining* @entity1
the @entity131 also has best goals - per - minute ratio of anyone at @entity1
