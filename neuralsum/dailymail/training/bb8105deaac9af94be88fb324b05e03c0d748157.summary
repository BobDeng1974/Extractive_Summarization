‘ the kids are only getting about a minute in the grotto and if they ask a question which is n’t in the script you are supposed to ignore them			2
’ mr @entity15 , 55 , resigned after just a week at the attraction in @entity48 , where families pay £ 5 per child to visit @entity5 ’s grotto			1

mr @entity15 , who was one of three santas working shifts at the grotto , said : ‘ all of the advertising said children would get to sit on @entity5 ’s knee			1
' that leaves @entity5 in the incredibly difficult position of trying to explain nicely that they ca n’t			0
‘ i eventually came to this decision that very young children – under a year old – could sit on my knee at the parents ’ request			2
’ in a letter to the @entity74 explaining his decision to resign , mr @entity15 added : ' i quickly discovered to my cost that digressions from the bland , formulaic script were being reported to management by the female elves working as @entity5 ’s helpers			1
' we were , in fact , being spied on			0
' festive fun : mr @entity15 worked as one of three @entity87 at the @entity5 's grotto in @entity18 the actor , who lives in @entity18 , also complained there were no lavatories for staff and nowhere to store personal belongings			1

a spokesman for @entity58 said : ' unfortunately , mr @entity15 was a @entity5 who decided to leave @entity18 ’s @entity8 of his own accord on 13 december			1
' however , if he had continued to flout the guidelines , he would have been dismissed and sent back to @entity106			0
' he was given a formal warning on 12 december for contravening company guidelines for allowing children to sit on his knee , before choosing to resign			1
' we were very disappointed by this but we were right to act on the experts ' advice			0
' he added : ‘ on a more positive note , a new @entity5 has just arrived all the way from @entity106 and is happily settling into his new grotto			0
’ one grotto worker said : ' he was a really grumpy @entity5			0
everyone loves the job , but he seemed to hate it			0
' he did n't get on with anyone , even the elves , and was very brusque with the children and their parents			2
' he would interrupt the children , saying : " i 'm talking now " ' - unnamed grotto worker ' he did n’t get on with anyone - even the elves			2
he was very brusque with the children and their parents and would interrupt children , saying " i ’m talking now "			2
' it ’s funny that he ’s complaining about the children not having enough time with him - he could n’t wait to get them out of the grotto			0
' mr @entity15 insisted he had not been grumpy with the children , saying : ' quite the opposite - and that 's what the fuss was about			2
' i was actually making an effort to interact with the children rather than just sticking to anunbelievably bland script			1
' i became grumpy with the way the whole thing was being run but i was n't grumpy with the children			0

@entity15 , 55 , left in *disgust* saying female elves reported him to *bosses*
he said they told on him when he deviated from ' unbelievably bland ' script
also said the @entity163 grotto in @entity18 was ' tacky '
but organisers @entity58 said he was ' brusque ' with children he spoke to
and they said he ' contravened guidelines ' for letting them sit on his knee
