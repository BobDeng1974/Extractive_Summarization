@entity10 and daughter @entity9 awoke to the smell of smoke in the early hours of the morning - and firefighters had to rescue them through the bathroom window of their house in @entity17			1
they were flabbergasted when fire crews revealed that the source of the blaze was a pile of clean tea towels that had burst into flames			1
burnt fingers : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 with the tea towels that went up in flames firefighters believe the cloths had retained heat after being taken out of the tumble dryer - and got so hot they burst into flames			1
cafe manager @entity31 , 19 , had brought the tea towels home from work countless times to wash and dry			1
she said : ' it ’s bizarre			0
we ’ve washed and tumble dried those towels the same way hundreds of times and nothing has ever gone wrong			2
' i woke up and i could smell this really strong smell of smoke			1
i went to my door and looked out and there were clouds of smoke billowing up the stairs			2
' i shouted to my mum who was fast asleep , and we ran into the bathroom			2
' feeling the heat : the flames from the pile of washing melted a plastic wash basket and set fire to the stool and wall , sending clouds of thick smoke through the house the pair were rescued shortly after 2am yesterday morning , after 999 operators told them to shut themselves in the bathroom and put wet towels around the door			1
@entity66 insisted after the @entity68 ' fire that although blazes started by spontaneous combustion were unusual , they were not unknown			0
@entity71 warned last october of the danger of ‘ exploding tea towels ’ after the phenomenon struck twice in a single day in @entity75 at a restaurant and college			1
a spokesman said cooking fats or chemicals on tea towels can spontaneously combust after being dried - and advised people to properly air laundry after drying to avoid it happening			1
mrs @entity10 , 49 , said : ' we were struggling to breathe as the smoke was coming in			1
it was really quite frightening			0
it does n’t seem real now			0
' after helping them out of the window , firefighters put out the blaze - but could find no obvious source of the fire			1
after investigating the scene , they realised a pile of recently laundered tea towels had spontaneously combusted			1
the towels and a plastic washing basket were destroyed in the blaze but , apart from a blackened kitchen wall , the rest of the house was untouched			0
fire station manager @entity103 , said blazes started by spontaneous combustion were unusual but not unknown			0
he said : ' due to the configuration of the materials and the circumstances at the scene , we have determined the most likely cause was self - heating to a point where ignition occurred			0
hot wash : the mother and daughter were lucky to escape with their lives after firefighters were called to their home at around 2am ' this is not a common phenomenon , but it has occurred and has been widely documented in the past			1
' mrs @entity10 , a personal banker for @entity125 , said : ' it was the most terrifying night of my life			2
' i ’d taken the towels out of the dryer before i went to bed at about 9.30pm , and made sure all the plugs and gas hobs were turned off , like i always do			0
' my daughter woke me up screaming : " @entity138 , there ’s smoke coming up the stairs ! " , and our smoke alarm started going off			2
' she pulled me into the bathroom and i grabbed my phone , but i was shaking so much i could barely dial 999			0
the 19 - year - old and 49 - year - old were helped out of a bathroom window at the rear of the house , pictured ' we could barely breathe and we had to stand in the bath and lean out of the window to get air			1
' the firemen came and helped us out of the window , but as they helped me down the ladder , i heard one firefighter shout to another : " bloody hell , get out of there now ! "			2
' it was terrifying - we were put into an ambulance and taken to hospital , just to be checked over			0
' the firemen asked us what had been on top of the stool in the kitchen , and i said , my plastic washing basket with the towels in it			0
' i think he was expecting me to say i ’d left a candle burning , or a plug socket overloaded - he was pretty surprised			0
' he said that it would have burned very slowly though , so it would have taken a few hours for the fire to take hold			0
' i could n’t believe doing the washing nearly cost me my house - or worse , my life			0
' we ’re very lucky that we were able to get out so quickly , and the firefighters did such a good job containing the fire			2
