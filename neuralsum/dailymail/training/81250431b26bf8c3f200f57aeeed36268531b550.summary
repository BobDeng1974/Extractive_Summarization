by @entity0 published : 20:17 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 20:17 est , 14 may 2013 royal dentist sir @entity1 , whose son @entity2 has been stymied by @entity4 officials who have refused to give his wife @entity7 residency as the son of the @entity12 ’s @entity11 dentist , @entity8 had every reason to believe that returning to @entity7 with his new bride after six years abroad would be a formality			1
but @entity2 , whose father sir @entity1 received his knighthood after 32 years as surgeon dentist to the @entity19 , faces heartache after @entity4 officials refused to grant his young @entity22 wife residency			1
‘ we are a perfectly legitimate couple and really did n’t expect all this trouble , ’ says @entity2 , 44			1
‘ my troubles started when i returned from @entity22 where i ’ve been working with major property dealers for six years			1
i met @entity27 there and fell in love			1
’ speaking at a @entity30 cocktail party , @entity2 — a cousin of actor @entity32 , the beau of film star @entity33 — tells me : ‘ @entity27 and i got married in @entity35 but neither of our parents came			1
‘ i suppose my father had more conventional lifestyle hopes for me , as we come from five generations of medics and he looked after the @entity43 ’s teeth as well			1
‘ even though @entity44 did n’t really understand my relationship with @entity27 , he turned up at @entity46 to greet us with a bottle of champagne when we came to @entity49			1
‘ this is no bought @entity22 bride situation			1
’ while @entity2 is continuing to work in property in @entity53 , @entity54 , 24 , has found work , too			1
‘ she is not living off me and has got a job at a @entity59 cocktail bar and i ’m proud of her , ’ he says			1
according to @entity1 , the @entity4 has rejected her request to settle here			2
‘ it has got very strict and said we did n’t have joint bank accounts or a joint electricity bill			2
‘ i ’m sure my father was shocked when this all happened , but he has been brilliant and when it ’s sorted out i ’m thinking of having a traditional @entity49 wedding or blessing , too , so he can be there and share our happiness			2
‘ i just hope this does n’t drag on for too long			2
’ the @entity4 says it has strict entry requirements for foreign spouses of @entity7 subjects			1
‘ these range from financial stipulations to showing the couple have actually met and proving the relationship is genuine and subsisting , ’ says a spokesman			2
romantic novelist @entity81 , pictured right , has had her dramas over the years — not least when she called the fire brigade and declared : ‘ my name is @entity81 and my chimney is on fire			2
’ but friends of the best - selling author were a little alarmed to receive an email begging for money because she and her family had been ‘ mugged in an alley by a gang of thugs ’ in @entity95			1
it said she needed £ 1,600 for hotel bills			2
@entity81 , a skiing pal of the @entity101 , was indeed embarrassed — not through a lack of funds but because the email was bogus			2
and , in fact , she had become the latest celebrity victim of a pernicious internet scam			2
‘ i was inundated all morning about it , ’ mother - of - two @entity81 , 43 , tells me from @entity111 , where she is on a book tour			1
‘ it ’s happened to me about three times in the past , so i think by now all my friends are smart enough to realise that the messages are just spam			2
’ other victims have included tv presenter @entity119 , veteran newsreader @entity120 — who was said to have been taken prisoner — and opera impresario and restaurateur @entity123 , who was said to have been robbed on holiday in @entity125			0
adds @entity81 : ‘ i ’ve changed my password now			0
as long as no one sends any money to the hackers then we ’re all ok			0
’ @entity133 heart - throb @entity131 could find himself upstaged at the @entity134 tonight by the arrival at the premier of his @entity138 movie of a chauffeur - driven dancing dog			1
@entity7 ’s @entity141 star @entity140 will watch @entity131 ’s red carpet arrival as he prepares for his own photocall to launch @entity140 : the movie			1
he and owner @entity140 drove to the @entity146 from @entity147 in agent @entity149 ’s limo			0
‘ @entity140 went on @entity151 ’s private jet to the @entity152 to appear on tv , so his own limo is nothing less than he is accustomed to , ’ says @entity149			0
@entity156 had been anticipating the day she would undergo a double mastectomy all her adult life			0
after her mother @entity159 was diagnosed with cancer — which has claimed the lives of all the maternal side of the family — @entity156 wrote a prescient script about the @entity166 curse			0
according to @entity170 ’s 2010 biography , @entity156 ’s first script , @entity168 , written in 1999 , was about a girl with a terminally - ill mother and a family history of cancer who discovers she has the disease in one breast but decides to have both removed			1
‘ it was very hardcore , ’ says a friend who read the script			0
serious : @entity181 and @entity182 the last time the @entity184 ’s polo - playing son @entity181 broke a bone he had the @entity187 ’s pretty daughter , @entity186 , to soothe his agony			1
but while his collarbone has healed , that youthful relationship has long since bitten the dust			0
now @entity0 , 25 , who bears the courtesy title @entity193 , has a new woman in his life even more ideally placed should he suffer another injury in the saddle			0
for his latest love is glamorous hospital doctor @entity182 , 26 , whose brothers @entity199 and @entity200 are polo players			0
all of which , she says , means she is brilliant at first aid			0
‘ we ’re in love and @entity182 is just about to move in with me , so it ’s very serious , ’ says @entity0 at the polo season launch party at @entity206 ’s in @entity30			0
‘ @entity210 can be risky so it ’s an added bonus that @entity182 is a medical lady who appreciates the game			0
’ adds @entity213 – educated @entity214 : ‘ they have very good first aiders on duty anyway , but it does help i ’m not the squeamish type ! ’ with his plans for a reunion tour with the @entity223 in disarray after gigs @entity225 were cancelled because of poor ticket sales , sir @entity220 has one thing to celebrate			0
he has just been immortalised in oils by artist @entity230 , but with one bizarre twist — the grizzled rocker is depicted covered in rats			0
@entity230 has also painted actor @entity234 and it was the movie hardman ’s daughter @entity236 , a friend of @entity220 ’s daughter @entity238 , who persuaded him to pose			0
but famously foul - mouthed @entity220 , 61 , had no idea about the rodents			1
@entity230 says : ‘ i wanted to use the rats as a symbol of degradation and poverty so i contacted a rat breeder			0
i then had a body double pose up and just poured 20 rats all over him			0
’ the rats came as a ‘ complete surprise ’ to @entity220 when he saw the painting but , adds @entity230 : ‘ his response , though colourful , was thoroughly positive			0
