by @entity1 reporter published : 11:59 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 02:01 est , 12 july 2012 an outraged cyclist has received a cheque for just 23p from court after a thief who stole his £ 160 bike was ordered to pay him compensation			1
cyclist @entity8 was delighted when told police had caught the thief who stole the bike			1
but his delight turned to disgust when he received the compensation cheque			2
@entity8 was outraged when the 23p cheque from the courts service arrived almost a year after his bike was stolen			1
the design engineer said he had already felt let down when he learned he was to get only £ 25 paid back by the thief			1
he was told the £ 25 payout was part of £ 500 compensation magistrates in @entity23 ordered the crook to pay to 21 victims who had their bikes taken by him			1
almost a year later , a letter arrived from the courts service - but he was astonished to find it contained just the cheque for 23p			1
he said : “ it is both infuriating and ridiculous and they even spelled my name wrongly on the cheque they sent me			2
' i would rather have not received anything at all			0
' to me it just goes to show that crime does pay and the legal system does n’t know what it is doing			0
i was mad enough about the £ 25 offer but they said they could n’t do anything to help me			2
but to get this cheque for 100th of what i was going to be getting is completely mystifying			2
' mr @entity8 was outraged when he received just 23p in compensation for his stolen bike			1
the 33 - year - old returned home to his flat in @entity23 , in july , last year , to find the bike missing			1
he called the police to report the crime and then later was told the thief had been caught and convicted of taking 21 bikes from around @entity23			1
mr @entity8 received a letter from @entity60 and @entity61 telling him about the £ 25 he would receive and he wrote a letter of complaint to its tribunal service who wrote back to him			2
in their letter it said : ' in your case the defendant was ordered to pay £ 499.94 to 21 victims of crime			2
' the defendant is currently in receipt of benefit and is paying that back at £ 10 a fortnight			0
' the large number of victims and the restriction on repayment periods has greatly reduced the amount of compensation each victim will receive			0
' the cheque for just 23p in compensation that was sent to @entity8 nearly a year after his bike was stolen			1
@entity8 said he felt “ insulted ” by the letter			0
he said : ' i do n’t even know what i am going to do with the cheque now			0
' it certainly is n’t worth queuing at the bank to pay it in for			0
' he said the court 's weak punishment would simply encourage more thefts			0
a spokesman for @entity102 ’s @entity101 said it vigorously pursued offenders who fail to pay victims ’ compensation , and that the 23p cheque had been sent to mr @entity8 by mistake			1
' money can be taken from an offender ’s earnings or from benefits if they are unemployed			0
' warrants can be issued instructing court employed agents to seize and sell goods belonging to the offender			0
' it is an independent judicial decision as to the size of monthly repayments of compensation to victims and fines - this is based on the ability of the defendant to pay			0
' ' if the defendant owes compensation to more than one victim the court will allocate the payments among those witnesses , ' said the spokesman			0
' it is normal practice for smaller cheques not to be sent to victims until the repayment has reached £ 5			0
' in this case the 23p cheque was issued in error for which we apologise			1
' ' the spokesman could not say when @entity8 would get his first cheque for £ 5 or when he might be expected to finally receive the total amount of compensation awarded			2
