what happens next is even more bizarre , as a dark haired woman seductively paints red lipstick on her lips and begins some kind of illicit encounter with the dog @entity28 - who is actually a rescue dog			1
but animal rights group @entity42 have slammed the advertisement , saying it is exploitative and demeaning to the greyhound			1
