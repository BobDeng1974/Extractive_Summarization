halal and kosher slaughter of animals should be outlawed , @entity1 's leading vet said today			1
@entity5 , president - elect of the @entity6 , has argued the ritual killing of poultry , sheep and cattle by cutting their throats causes unnecessary suffering to animals			1
traditionally , @entity15 and @entity16 slaughter practices involve animals having their throats slit and the blood drained because it is ' humane ' but mr @entity5 , who has been accused of ' inflaming prejudice ' by religious leaders , says animals must be stunned before the cut because some will be conscious for up to two minutes before death			1
' permitted ' : halal foods are those that @entity25 are allowed to eat or drink under @entity26 the @entity28 government has been accused of religious persecution after it banned the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat			1
despite huge pressure from the @entity25 and @entity15 communities not to , the practice was banned last month as the country 's minister for food , @entity39 , maintained that ' animal rights come before religion '			1
campaign : @entity5 , president - elect of the @entity6 , has argued the ritual killing of animals causes unnecessary suffering to animals mr @entity5 said @entity1 abattoirs should follow @entity28 's example			1
' our view has always been that animals should be stunned			2
they should be imperceptible to pain as death supervenes , ' he told @entity54 's today programme			0
' we are looking for a meeting of minds to review the evidence base which clearly shows that slaughtering animals without stunning compromises welfare			2
if that ca n't happen then i would like labelling at the point of sale that gives the consumer informed choice			0
if that is not possible we would be looking for a ban for killing without stunning			2
' there is no insensibility for these animals by cutting its throat and these remain conscious for seven seconds for sheep and two minutes for cattle and that is not acceptable			2
as a vet and scientist welfare is top of our list '			0
@entity82 , vice president of the @entity83 , responded : ' i really regret @entity5 's remarks , which are completely misleading animals that are killed for the @entity15 or @entity25 markets do not bleed to death			1
animals that are killed for the general market or the @entity25 and @entity15 market are killed in exactly the same way			1
' a large animal has its throat cut and this renders it insensible to pain and unconscious			0
the @entity15 method is designed to bring that about instantly , and using tendentious language is not helpful			2
@entity101 the @entity15 religion focuses on the most humane way of bring death			2
if you eat meat you have to accept that an animal that is live is then killed and the most important thing to do is to do it humanely			2
animal welfare organisations have shown it fails to stun in between nine and 31 per cent of cases			0
when an animal is mis - stunned it suffers enormous pain and distress			0
when you eat your chicken from the supermarket you need to know it has been carried by an industral conveyor belt and dumped in a bath of electricute water			0
we do n't do that and we would n't			0
' in @entity28 you had a political act designed for populist reasons because of prejudice against @entity25 and i am worried mr @entity5 is speaking in ways that inflame prejudice			1
argument : the @entity15 community says that the kosher method of killing animals like in this abattoir is more humane than stunning the new leader of @entity1 's vets has called for the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat to be banned mr @entity5 said the way halal and kosher meat is created , through the throat being slit , resulted in ' five or six seconds ' of pain for the animal			1
' they will feel the cut , ' he said			0
' they will feel the massive injury of the tissues of the neck			0
they will perceive the aspiration of blood they will breath in before they lose consciousness			0
' he told the newspaper the issue was ' one of the most important on our ( vets ' ) radar			0
' halal halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade , while a @entity25 butcher recites a religious verse			2
all blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under @entity16 law			0
under @entity16 law , an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious			0
@entity175 according to the laws , in order for a meat to kosher it must come from an animal that means the kosher rules			0
these are the animal must be ruminant and have split hooves			0
ruminant animals chew food once and swallow , before regurgitating it and chewing again			0
animals that @entity15 can eat include cows , sheep , goats and deer			1
they can not eat pigs despite the fact it has split hooves because it is not a ruminant animal			0
before slaughtering , the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe , causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness			0
@entity15 believe this is a way of killing that shows ' respect and compassion ' as set out in @entity15 law			1
more than 6,000 animals are killed in religious abattoirs every week in @entity1			1
the halal meat market is believed to be worth up to an estimated £ 2billion			0
charities including @entity217 and the @entity218 also support the move to ban the slaughter of animals without stunning first			2
however , it is feared far - right groups could use mr @entity5 's comments to support their campaigns on the issue			1
@entity227 , of the @entity228 , said cuts left over from animals which have been slaughtered for halal and kosher meat often enter the general meat trade and people do not realise they are eating it			1
the @entity15 practice of slaughtering animals is known as shechita			1
@entity237 , of @entity238 @entity1 , said if the government labelled meat which had been slaughtered for religious reasons it should also inform consumers if their meat had been ' shot , gassed , electocuted or drowned			1
he also said banning the religious slaughter of animals had been a way of driving out @entity15 and @entity25 populations in the 19th century			1
last week the @entity28 government was accused of being anti-semitic after passing the law which banned the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat			1
the change has been described as ‘ anti-semitic and ‘ a clear interference in religious freedom ’ by a group petitioning against the change			0
under @entity257 regulations , animals are required to be stunned before slaughter unless an exemption can be found on religious grounds			2
animals must be conscious when killed for the meat to be kosher under @entity15 law and halal under @entity16 law .			1

*muslims* and @entity15 are asked to use more ' acceptable ' methods of killing
@entity5 wants @entity270 to consider a ban on kosher or halal
president of @entity6 says all should be stunned first
6,000 animals are killed in religious abattoirs every week in @entity1
