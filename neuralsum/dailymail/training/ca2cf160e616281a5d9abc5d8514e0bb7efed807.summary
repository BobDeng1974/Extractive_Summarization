the reaction of older fans to @entity3 ’s appointment as @entity5 manager may well be : ' do i not like that '			1
but it does n’t mean they are casting dispersions about the 51 - year - old @entity12 ’s suitability to take over from @entity13 on the south coast			2
for all @entity3 ’s considerable achievements in the game , he is best - known to a generation of supporters for being at the centre of an infamous fly - on - the - wall tv documentary about @entity24 ’s reign as @entity26 manager			1
signing on : @entity3 ( centre ) will take over from @entity13 as @entity5 manager @entity12 delight : @entity3 scores against @entity26 to deny them a place at the 1994 @entity30 escape : @entity3 escaped the foul with a yellow card and @entity26 got a free - kick outside the area helpless : nothing went right for manager @entity24 that infamous night in @entity37 in 1993 the impossible job , which spawned a thousand catchphrases , @entity3 escapes a red card for a bad foul on @entity42 and later scores the goal which knocked @entity26 out of playing in the 1994 @entity30			1
as @entity3 and his team - mates celebrate , a downtrodden @entity24 tells the fourth official : ‘ tell your pal , he ’s just cost me my job ”			1
of course , @entity3 ’s career is about far more than that one @entity53 - @entity26 game but it ’ll certainly come up whenever @entity5 get a dodgy decision next season			1
@entity3 is one of many great @entity12 players who have lit up the game since 1974			2
the difference between him and the likes of @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 is that he was a defender			0
nominally , he was a defender anyway			0
he played at the back but was best - known for his ability on the ball and his devastating free - kicks			0
bullet finish : @entity3 scores for @entity68 in the @entity70 cup final in 1992 against @entity71 pure joy : @entity3 scored the only goal in the 1992 @entity75 final for @entity68 against @entity71 the most famous one came for @entity68 against @entity71 at @entity77 in 1992 that gave @entity68 their first - ever @entity75			1
his goal tally of 193 is probably a world - record for a defender			0
@entity3 the player would walk into a @entity12 all - time xi. in a 17 - year playing career with @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity68 and @entity88 he won nine league titles and two @entity90 – the first with @entity92 ’s @entity87 in 1987			1
as someone who worked under @entity60 at @entity68 , his instincts to play the right way will please @entity5 fans who loved the football under @entity13 and will be desperate to keep at least some of their bright young players like @entity100 and @entity101 at the club			1
@entity103 , who played for @entity3 at @entity86 , said when he was with the @entity105 club that @entity3 ’s talent as a player gave him an advantage over other managers			2
giving youth a chance : @entity3 helped develop @entity12 internationls @entity112 and @entity114 ( below ) talent spotter : @entity3 helped develop @entity116 ( right ) prolific : @entity117 ( centre ) scored 20 goals for @entity88 under @entity3 in 2012 ‘ he was terrific			1
we ’d be taking free - kicks and after a while he ’d step in and blast some home , ’ said the striker			0
' talk about respect , he ’d only been with us two days and he had it from the lads			0
you could see he got on really well with them			0
’ but it ’s one thing believing in the right thing and another being successful over the long term in the @entity134 , as @entity3 ’s one - time @entity68 team - mate @entity135 found at @entity136 last season			2
so far , @entity3 ’s managerial career has not quite matched the stardust of his playing days though he can be proud that @entity53 ’s defence in this @entity30 is dominated by @entity88 players he helped develop			1
high point : @entity3 led @entity88 to two second - place finishes in the @entity12 league talking tactics : @entity3 gets his message across to his @entity147 playes during training at @entity148 in 2005 after starting out as @entity92 ’s assistant with @entity53 at the @entity150 and then performing the same role at @entity68 , @entity3 became a manager in his own right with @entity154 in 2000			1
he served @entity86 , @entity147 , @entity87 and @entity155 over the next decade with mixed effects			1
but his time in @entity37 – scene of his famous foul on @entity42 – with @entity88 was @entity3 at his best , triumphing against the odds in a manner that clearly impressed the @entity5 board			1
once - great @entity88 were in ruins when @entity3 took over in 2011			2
with no budget for transfers , they finished in the top three in each of his three seasons at the club – twice runners - up			0
even more impressively , the club ’s @entity170 was voted the best in @entity53 , better even than @entity86			2
replacement : @entity3 has taken over from @entity13 who joined @entity174 in may top stuff : @entity5 enjoyed an impressive @entity134 campaign last season , finishing eighth further shades of @entity5 came in the development of young players into the first - team			1
@entity182 , @entity183 , @entity112 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 all went on to play for @entity53 having worked first under @entity3			2
having worked with young @entity188 striker @entity117 when he scored 20 goals on loan for @entity88 , you can expect @entity3 to try and link up with him again at @entity191 ’s			1
@entity193 football is obviously far more competitive than the @entity12 @entity194			0
instead of being a national hero like he was in @entity53 , @entity3 is still regarded as a bogey - man by @entity26 fans over the age of 30			1
without him , we may have gone to the 1994 @entity30 in @entity200 and had a great time			2
but if he can help uncover a few more @entity100 ’s at @entity5 , their fans might decide they do rather like him after all			0
after what has seemed an interminable three weeks of speculation , @entity5 seem to be on the verge of going @entity12 with the appointment of @entity3 as the replacement for @entity13 , and that prospect has been met pretty positively among the @entity5 fanbase			1
@entity3 is of a pedigree unheard of at @entity191 ’s before , a multiple title winner as both player and manager , a genuine big name , while also having demonstrated a willingness and ability to bring young players through a club ’s academy into the first team			0
as a result , @entity3 polling 67 % in a four - way race with @entity224 , @entity225 and ' anyone else ' probably comes as no surprise			0
high flyer : @entity101 ( right ) is wanted by @entity229 at @entity230 on the move ? @entity100 has been linked with moves to @entity233 and @entity234 giant leaps have been made by the club in the last five years , @entity3 could certainly be the man to ensure the perceived glass ceiling does n’t get reached just yet			0
his first task , and the key for the majority of the fanbase , will be to persuade last season ’s stars that they still have a job to do on the @entity246 and that there is no need to seek moves elsewhere as many of their ambitions can still be met here			0
whether he will be able to persuade @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity251 to remain is open to debate – their minds may have already been made up – but if they depart , he will need to ensure the cash received is reinvested wisely			0
unsurprisingly , we ’re already being linked with young @entity12 players in the press , and based on the national team ’s demolition of @entity262 on friday , that may not be a bad thing			0
it ’s never a dull moment at @entity5 , but hopefully things might at least settle down into some sort of sanity for a few months once this appointment is finalised			0
