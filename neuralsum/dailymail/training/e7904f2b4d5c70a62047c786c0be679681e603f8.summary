by @entity1 reporter published : 14:10 est , 26 january 2014 updated : 20:09 est , 27 january 2014 @entity3 was born into the @entity5 community , a fundamentalist sect of @entity7			1
the fifth of 11 children born to a prominent @entity10 rabbi in @entity11			2
@entity3 and her ten siblings were raised to worship two things : @entity14 and the men who ruled their world			1
at the age of 15 , @entity3 was preparing for marriage			1
but the tradition - bound future @entity3 envisioned for herself was cut short when , at 16 , she was caught exchanging letters with a male friend questioning her ultraorthodox @entity24 faith			1
‘ i was now marked as a girl who had spoken with boys			2
i was no longer a good girl , ’ she says			2
‘ i wanted to be good			2
i was just too curious			2
my evil desires had momentarily led me astray , ' she told the @entity38			2
‘ your behavior has become unacceptable , ’ said her mother			2
‘ we give you chance after chance , and you keep on messing up and hurting people			2
' ‘ you are not getting any more allowance			2
you ’ll have to figure out how to get by on your own , ’ she continued			2
‘ you think you ’re so grown - up ? let ’s see how grown - up you are			2
’ the final straw was when she purchased a sweater that her parents deemed immodest ; she expressed an ambition to one day attend college and doubted the strict codes of conduct prescribed by her religion			2
@entity3 ’s parents were unforgiving			1
afraid , in part , that her behavior would affect the marriage prospects of their other children , they put her on a plane to @entity63 before her 18th birthday and cut off ties			1
@entity66 filmed by @entity67 for @entity68 shunned : at the age of 17 , @entity3 was sent to live in @entity63 , alone			1
it was there she learned about life in the real world but not before making a number of mistakes after the sweater incident , @entity77 ’s parents found her a studio apartment in @entity80 , @entity81 for $ 450 a month and job as a secretary that paid minimum wage			1
they paid the first month ’s rent — but after that she was completely on her own in every sense of the word			2
in her @entity5 community , there was a strict segregation of the sexes			2
‘ women in my family were not allowed to attend college or become @entity24 scholars			2
men had the ultimate authority in the home and in the community , ’ @entity77 writes in her memoir , cut me loose			1
a girl ’s two most important goals , she says , are to be modest and obedient			0
in order to reach these goals , according to @entity77 , a girl must : wear shirts buttoned to her neck with sleeves covering her elbows and with skirts that fall below the knee			0
even wearing patterned tights or wide belts are banned as too provocative			0
abstain from talking to unmarried men			0
be seen and not heard			0
the community frowned on women singing or talking too loudly			0
@entity10 : women must abstain from talking to unmarried men			0
¿ essentially , be seen and not heard			0
the community would frown on women singing or talking too loudly			0
@entity3 's parents believed that anything to the contrary would jeopardize her chances of finding a husband these rules ( and many more ) were vital to maintaining a good reputation , an absolute necessity for landing a suitable husband			1
‘ a girl ’s sexuality was so powerful , ’ says @entity77 , ‘ any hint of it had to always be completely hidden			0
’ at 17 , she was banished by her parents and left to fend for herself in @entity63			1
it was then her heartbreaking and terrifying experience began			0
for several years she lived alone in a shabby studio apartment in the @entity80 neighborhood of @entity81			0
her father had severed communication entirely			0
accustomed to seeking male approval , she now attracted plenty of the wrong kind			0
she approached men hung out on the local basketball court and began a series of grim and risky relationships , culminating in her rape age 17 by a boyfriend			1
‘ i soon began to stop and watch the games , ’ she says			0
‘ i longed for my stares to beckon one of those people to the bench where i sat , to talk to me			0
’ several of the men began to flirt with her and one , called @entity162 , took a special interest in her			0
when @entity162 asked her to accompany him back to his apartment , she said yes , knowing that as a good @entity10 girl , she could not date or marry him			0
awakening : @entity3 was unprepared to navigate the freedoms of secular life			1
she worked as a prostitute , cut herself , and had an affair with a married professor ultimately in the basement at a @entity173 club , @entity162 raped her			1
not even knowing what intercourse entailed , and asked herself , ‘ was that sex ? ’ she lacked the basic understanding of the body and the tools to deal with men to whom she had spent a childhood learning to yield and please			0
by 19 , ms. @entity3 had overdosed , swallowing a half - bottle of aspirin after mutilating herself with a rusty razor and ended up spending 10 days in a psychiatric hospital			1
. and by 21 she had tried to establish herself as a @entity188 prostitute			1
she picked one , a lawyer from the @entity192			0
and even though she had been in the city now for several years , even after living a very ‘ modern ’ life , she still was clueless			1
she never quoted a fee and agreed to meet him at his place			0
he paid her after their second go - round — and only $ 60			0
shamed , she vowed not to prostitute herself again			1
cast out in @entity63 , without a father or husband tethering her to the @entity10 community , @entity3 was unprepared to navigate the freedoms of secular life			1
cut me loose : @entity206			1
the book details @entity209 life as she left her @entity10 sect and ventured out into a brave new world ' there is little room for a single girl in @entity5 life , ' she explains , referring to the many daily restrictions imposed by ultraorthodox practice			1
' for a woman , the rhythm of observance is tied to family			0
one is either a daughter or a wife			1
' at one point she returned back to the family home for a family dinner			0
her parents made her eat off paper plates — not to meet the requirements of @entity24 law , her sister explained , but to prevent her from ' contaminating ' the family			0
after ms. @entity3 attempted suicide , she writes , her parents told her other siblings that she just wanted attention and that they should ignore her			1
she spent the next few years using her sexuality as a way of attracting the male approval she had been conditioned to seek out as a child , while becoming increasingly unfaithful to the religious dogma of her past			0
it took ms. @entity3 a long time , years even , to shake the feeling that she was corrupted and did n’t deserve happiness			1
long after she had dropped the external markers of religiosity — her modest clothes and dietary restrictions — she still judged her actions based off of the standards with which she was raised			0
' even though i put on pants and was having sex with people , it does n’t meant that my brain bounced back into normal , un-fundamentalist religion shape , ' she said			0
she succeeded however , when it came to education			0
she had been accepted to @entity261 on a scholarship and achieved straight - a ’s			1
she became involved with a married professor , 42 years her senior who encouraged her to speak up when it came to her opinions on politics , culture and the world			1
@entity3 has tried to confront the oppressive world of religious fundamentalism and the broader issues that face even the most secular young women as they grapple with sexuality and identity			1
ms. @entity3 also used her freedom to attend college , and with the encouragement of the prof , was awarded a scholarship at @entity280 earning a master 's degree at @entity280 's @entity282			1
happy endings : @entity3 eventually found true love , graduated from @entity280 after winning a scholarship there and is now married with a daughter ms. @entity3 never fully explains her parents ' vicious behavior			1
' i felt like i was caught in a garish nightmare , ' she says , recalling the period that led to her estrangement			0
now at the age of 31 , @entity3 is married to @entity295 , who also left a @entity297 upbringing in @entity298 , @entity299			1
the two have since married and have a daughter			1
‘ i fiercely believe that all people should have a right to a self - determined life , ’ she says			2
' my parents getting stricter and stricter , my petty transgressions ballooning into terrifying sins			0
' it appears as though in the name of religion , they had forgotten basic humanity .			0
