the state pension is a ‘ right ’ earned over a lifetime and not a benefit , a minister has said			2
pensions minister @entity5 said the elderly were driven ‘ up the wall ’ by politicians lumping the weekly payment with other welfare payments			1
mr @entity5 said the government was going to stop referring to the state pension , worth £ 113 a week , as a benefit because of the stigma attached to claiming welfare			1
pensions minister @entity5 said it was ' shocking ' to lump the state pension in with other benefits @entity19 has previously suggested that the state pension could be included in a future welfare cap after the election			1
but mr @entity5 said that defining it as a benefit in that way would be ‘ shocking ’			2
he said : ‘ @entity19 want to put it in the welfare cap , which is shocking really			1
if you have an over-spend on [ one benefit ] , then you might cut the state pension to make up the shortfall			0
‘ that completely undermines what the state pension is			0
to include it in the welfare cap would be quite wrong			1
’ the @entity39 minister told @entity40 : ‘ the law refers to the state pension as a benefit and has done since the war			0
‘ as our research shows , it drives pensioners up the wall if you talk about claiming a benefit rather than the state pension			2
‘ absolutely rightly , it is yours by right , you have paid your national insurance contributions			1
there 's a certain amount of stigma about claiming benefits , when people draw their state pension that 's not how they think of it			0
’ the government 's annual ' benefits ' bill is dominated by state pension payments , which accounts for more than £ 1 in every £ 2 spent on welfare the @entity69 has accepted that it needs to consider the ‘ tone and wording ’ it uses when discussing the state pension			0
the state pension is something that elderly people feel that they have ‘ built up entitlement to ’ by working , the government has said .			0

@entity5 said pensioners were driven ' up the wall ' by *comparison*
claimed it was ' shocking ' @entity19 considered including in future welfare cap
he said the pension was a ' right ' earned through national insurance
