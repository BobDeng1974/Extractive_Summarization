the family of a surfer who had his hand and part of his arm torn off in a shark attack have launched an appeal to help fund his long road to recovery			1
@entity9 is now in a stable condition at the @entity11 after he was mauled by a shark at @entity13 , east of @entity14 on @entity16 's south coast on thursday			1

' ' the time ahead will be one of many challenges and he will be needing plenty of support & assistance			0
to assist @entity9 & his family , donations either small or large will be greatly appreciated			2
' the appeal comes as @entity16 fisheries have revealed bite marks on the 23 year old 's surfboard , indicate a great white shark was responsible for his injuries			1
the two white sharks that were killed by fisheries officers following the incident were taken to @entity46 for examination by the department 's experts			1
@entity70 ' principal shark scientist dr. @entity69 said those examinations were unable to confirm whether either shark was involved in the incident			2
he said while results were inconclusive , it was not uncommon for sharks to disgorge their stomach contents when they were caught			2
' we have also examined the surfboard used by the man involved in the incident on thursday and indications are that a white shark was responsible for the injuries he received , ' he said			1
surfer @entity9 lost parts of both arms in the attack near @entity14 , @entity16 on thursday @entity9 was flown to @entity46 by the @entity47 within hours of the attack on thursday which is believed to have been caused by a great white shark examinations by @entity29 scientists have revealed that the bite on @entity9 's surfboard was caused by a great white shark ' jaw measurements will also help with future bite investigations			1
the first white shark caught is 3.46 metres long ; the second white shark is 2.68 metres in length			1
' an online appeal to help in @entity9 's recovery has also been launched and has already raised over $ 5000 ' our team has since collected samples from both sharks including sections of vertebrae , which will assist us with our research work			1
' ' now that our investigation is complete , material will be made available to other research institutions , ' said dr. @entity69			0
@entity16 premier @entity111 said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety			0
' the threat is there and sadly ( thursday ) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen , ' mr @entity111 said			0
' @entity46 beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them ( but ) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter			0
' it was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by @entity16 officials			0
fisheries shark response unit manager @entity127 defended the move amid reports mr @entity9 might have been mauled by two bronze whalers , saying it was ' more likely ' a white pointer was responsible			1
beaches in the @entity135 have now been reopened and no new shark sightings or reports in the area have been made since the incident			2
caution signs at key access points will remain in place , while department vessels which have been on the water will remain on patrol			0
incident : the attack occurred in scenic @entity13 , on @entity16 's south coast a separate online appeal has also been launched on @entity150 , encouraging everyone to give generously towards @entity9 's recovery			1
set up by @entity153 , founder of the @entity16 sharks culls campaign , it said , ' @entity9 's medical assistance would not have been cheap at all ! let 's show how much we really do care about people ! ' ' every effort is being taken to get a hold of @entity9 's family in terms of this fundraiser , including calling @entity165 , @entity166 and certain members of the media			1
' ' i got involved because it 's a tragic incident and because of my connections with family and those who have had shark attacks before , they need all the support they can get , ' said ms @entity178			2
so far the appeal has raised well over its $ 1000 goal and is at more than $ 5000 with more than 100 people donating			1
' blown away by the support of the community			0
' ' so we 've been speaking to @entity186 ( shark attack survivor ) in @entity188 to see if he 'll speak to @entity9 , depends if @entity9 is willing , ' she said			2
' assist ( fundraising money ) @entity186 to go from @entity188 to @entity46 , the rest will go all to medical expenses involved in surgery he has had and the treatment he 's going to need , including counselling for family			2
' the campaign will close on october 14			0
the sharks campaigner says the system has let @entity9 down and more needs to be done to educate people in what 's happening at their popular beaches			1
' in @entity205 @entity204 , there 's a shark spotters program , flags and alerts , to alert people of shark activity			0
' ' we 're not doing enough of this in @entity16			0
there needs to be a national view on this , i think , how can educating people harm the public , ' said ms @entity153			0
' think government needs to do more for surfers and beach goers to have greater access to devices that are proven to work ... , surf smart ( electronic devices on surfboards ) , wet suits which deter sharks , these things should be available to the public at subsidised costs			0
' ' why are these products not more accessible when our premier is talking public safety issues			0
' for the latest detection and sighting information , beach users should check the @entity238 â€“ twitter.com / @entity239			0
report any shark sightings to water police on 9442 8600			0
