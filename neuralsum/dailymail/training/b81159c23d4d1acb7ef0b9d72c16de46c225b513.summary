@entity0 has angrily denied influencing provincial selection , rubbishing suggestions he has ' blocked ' @entity4 's path back to the @entity6 squad			1
head coach @entity0 has confirmed @entity7 and @entity8 will fight it out for @entity6 's no 13 shirt in the upcoming @entity12 series			1
@entity7 and @entity8 face a shoot - out to replace the retired @entity14 , with @entity16 centre @entity4 overlooked for @entity6 's autumn ranks			1
@entity6 coach @entity0 has angrily denied influencing provincial selection @entity4 last year claimed his ' face does n't fit ' with the @entity6 set - up , while @entity21 left @entity22 for @entity23 in the summer , frustrated by his lack of national chances			1
@entity0 insisted he is monitoring the progress of both centres , but blasted the ' massive misnomer ' that he orders provincial coaches to select players in positions of his choosing			0
' we 've probably gone with @entity7 and @entity8 : they are the two guys who are playing 13 , ' said @entity0 , speaking at the launch of a new @entity12 advertising campaign in @entity37			1
@entity16 's @entity39 - born centre @entity8 is now eligible to represent @entity6 under the residency rule ' i think there has been a massive misnomer that i influence provincial selection			1
' that is absolutely untrue : the guys that are selected in the centre , or to carry water , are nothing to do with my selections			0
' they are the provincial coaches , they are looking to do their best for the province and that 's the way it should be			0
' for someone to imply that @entity4 has been blocked is wrong : he 's very much on our radar			2
' @entity4 had a shoulder operation ; he 's come back from injury , then had a rib injury			2
' but he 's still a guy that 's still in our thinking for 13			0
@entity66 's @entity65 remains @entity6 's first - choice fly - half for november ' to say that @entity21 may have left because he saw the writing on the wall is massively disappointing : he is still on our radar , we keep an eye on what 's happening at @entity23			1
' it 's frustrating , because selection is a tough enough job without the impression we 're influencing things			0
' we have a very hands - off approach : we try not to interfere			0
' we have a lot of faith in what they are delivering , and we benefit from the product of their efforts			0
' @entity86 boss @entity0 defended his decision to omit @entity88 from @entity6 's autumn squad , claiming the @entity16 fly - half needs regular club rugby after injuries			1
@entity66 's @entity65 remains @entity6 's premier outside - half , with @entity95 's @entity94 also making the squad for november 's three - @entity12 challenge against @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
' @entity88 's only played one full game this season , ' said @entity0 , who opted for @entity104 's @entity103 ahead of @entity88			2
' he needs to be playing at the moment - he does n't need to be training with us			0
' he 's obviously disappointed , but he 's a tough young man , we 've got a lot of respect for @entity88			2
' @entity103 did very , very well on the summer 's @entity6 tour , the feedback was that he led by example , both on and off the field			0
' this camp gives us a little bit of an opportunity to work with him and help him to develop him as a player			0
' @entity39 under - 21 cap @entity8 steps up to @entity6 's senior squad for the first time after completing his three - year residency requirements at @entity123			1
the 29 - year - old will face stiff competition from @entity22 's 21 - year - old powerhouse @entity7 , who remains favourite to start alongside @entity129 this autumn			1
' @entity8 has good variety in his kicking game , and his ability to read defensively at tackle time is good , ' said former @entity95 coach @entity0			2
' he can carry and slip tackles , or at least win the gain - line , and i think you could just about say ditto for @entity7			0
' he 's also got a very good kicking game			0
' his passing game i think is a super aspect to his game , @entity7 , he 's got a very good width and a really flat , wide pass - and the ability to make the subtle passes as well			2
