around one and a half billion people across the globe are bald or have some form of hair loss			1
now a company in @entity5 has come up with what it claims to be the solution - a helmet that fires cool lasers at the wearers scalp to stimulate hair growth			1
the @entity13 headgear is said to be the only wearable , clinical - strength laser treatment that people can use at home , but it will set buyers back almost $ 800 ( £ 475 )			1
the @entity13 laser helmet ( pictured ) claims to be the only wearable clinical - strength laser treatment that people can use at home the @entity26 claims to reverse the shrinking of follicles using lasers with regular use , up to between 18 and 26 weeks			1
the company promises that such dedication results in cleaner , thicker and more manageable hair that is less oily			0
hair shafts are larger and there is less fallout in the shower and on pillows			0
between 28 and 52 weeks of use for 20 minutes twice a week , it regrows hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles as well as boosting cell metabolism and reducing the effects of protein blocking enzymes			1
in this time , the scalp will be healthier , less itchy and less inflamed , the company said			0
after 100 weeks of treatment , hair will be fuller and thicker			2
it claims to grow healthy new hair , double the follicle size of existing hair and can even prevent hair loss			1
‘ getting your hair back is a convenient and affordable process , ’ the company said			0
laser light therapy has been proven to improve hair health , but cold laser therapy has only been available at specialist clinics			0
@entity26 lets people use this advanced technology at home , and contains high efficiency lasers that produce virtually no heat but allow the maximum amount of light to be delivered , the company claim			2
however , the technology comes at a price as the helmet costs $ 795 ( £ 473 plus shipping )			1
it contains 80 lasers , so that light can reach 90 square inches ( 582 square centimetres ) of the 111 square inch ( 720 square centimetre ) average scalp area			0
users of the device are meant to wear it for 20 minutes at a time , twice a week			0
for the first 18 to 24 weeks of use , it is designed to reverse the shrinking of hair follicles to stop further hair loss			1
the helmet contains 80 lasers so that light can reach 90 square inches ( 582 square centimetres ) of the 111 square inch ( 720 square centimetre ) average scalp area			2
it is rechargeable and features proximity sensors ( pictured ) to ensure that the lasers are in the correct position the helmet ( illustrated ) claims to set about regrowing hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles , stimulating microcirculation , improving the metabolism of cells and protein synthesis ‘ you will find you have cleaner , more manageable hair with improved lustre and fuller body , decreased oiliness and larger hair shafts			1
you 'll also find less hair fallen out in the shower and on pillows , ’ the company said			0
after 28 weeks of regular wear , the helmet claims to set about regrowing hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles , stimulating microcirculation and improving the metabolism of cells			1
it ‘ reduces the effects of protein blocking enzymes , promoting thickness and density , ’ the company said			0
@entity26 claims that with regular use for up to 50 weeks , wearers of the laser helmet will have thicker and longer hair , plus a healthier scalp that is less itchy and inflamed			1
users of the device ( pictured ) are meant to wear the helmet for 20 minutes at a time , twice a week			0
for the first 18 to 24 weeks of use it is designed to reverse the shrinking of hair follicles to stop further hair loss after 52 weeks , ‘ the hairs on the top of the head ... will start filling in			1
after 100 weeks … fuller and thicker hair will result with continued use , ’ the company said			0
the helmet was the brainchild of former @entity150 scientist @entity149 , who is the founder and chief executive of @entity13			2
he wanted to find a way of preventing his own hair loss at the age of 32 without using medication			1
he explained the laser helmet can be used alongside other hair restoration treatments and after chemotherapy			2
however , one expert from the @entity160 of @entity161 said that lotions can be much more effective at stimulating blood flow in the scalp than lasers			0
while he admitted he had not tried out the @entity26 product , he said that he has never seen impressive results from a similar system - whether at home or in a clinic			0
dr @entity171 , medical director of the @entity172 , said : ' i do believe that laser technology has validity , but i ’m sceptical of the specific claims made by @entity177 that this particular headgear has the ability to increase the hair shaft diameter by 200 per cent			2
i have not seen any scientific evidence to support this			0
' it ’s great to see businesses putting resources to the development of this technology , but more scientific results are needed to back - up the huge claims that @entity26 is making			2

a firm in @entity5 created the helmet that fires cool lasers at the scalp
these lasers target follicles and stimulate hair growth and development
@entity13 *'s* helmet is said to be the only wearable clinical - strength laser treatment people can use at home
it claims to grow healthy new hair , double the follicle size of existing hair , and can even prevent hair loss
the helmet can be *pre-ordered* for $ 795 ( £ 473 plus shipping )
