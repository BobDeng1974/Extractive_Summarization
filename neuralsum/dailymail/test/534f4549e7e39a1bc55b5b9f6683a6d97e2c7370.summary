the biggest pension reforms in a century have been met with confusion as customers as young as 23 try to cash in their retirement savings			1
pension firms said @entity7 remained baffled about how the radical changes worked , with many unaware of age restrictions or tax implications			1
since monday , over- 55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life , known as an annuity			1
and yesterday , the first people to cash in their pots began to receive their money			1
others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once			1
the confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the government 's pensions helpline			0
the @entity53 said that , ahead of the election , it had switched to a ' low level ' advertising campaign for its @entity58 guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months			0
' @entity60 ' rules bar government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party			0
but experts said barring tv adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers , some of whom were already confused by the changes			2
experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over- 55s can cash in their pensions and spend them instead of being forced to buy an annuity ( file image ) @entity80 , of @entity81 , said it was ' crazy to stop advertising @entity58 under @entity60 rules ' , while @entity84 , who runs a financial training firm , asked on @entity86 : should n't the consumer / taxpayer come first ?			1
' the @entity53 said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for april and most of may			0
pensions firm @entity91 said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone			2
but several calls a day have been from people under - 55 trying to access their cash , including a 23 - year - old who mistakenly believed they could ' get hold of their pot now '			2
@entity100 , of @entity91 , said : ' misunderstandings exist around when you can access your funds			0
' since the new freedoms were announced , we 've received a steady number of calls from people under the age of 55 who think they can access their funds under the new rules			0

pension firms said @entity7 remain baffled about how radical changes work
over- 55s are now able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots
some customers in their 20s have been trying to withdraw retirement savings , despite being three decades too young
others do not know they face hefty tax bill if they remove all cash at once
