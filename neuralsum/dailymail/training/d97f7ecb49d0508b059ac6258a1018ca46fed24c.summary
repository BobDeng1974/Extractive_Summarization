a cliff - edge hotel could soon collapse into the sea after authorities decided they could n't afford the cost of building defences			1
the @entity5 , overlooking the cliffs at @entity7 , in @entity8 , has been forced to close its children 's garden play area that backs on to the cliffs which are crumbling at a dangerous rate of a metre a month			1
the play area 's ship was moved at a cost of £ 800,000 a year ago to a safer location - one that is now crumbling , as more huge chunks of the beer garden slump onto the beach			1
a plan to build a flood defence wall to keep the hotel from falling into the sea has been abandoned			0
in september , a funding bid was made for £ 570,000 to build a new section of sea wall between the threatened hotel and @entity40			2
but @entity41 says it is now dropping its bid altogether due to time pressures and a financial risk			1
the cliffs at @entity7 in @entity8 are at risk of collapse by a process called abrasion			1
this is when the waves crash against the foot , or the toe of the cliff , and start to erode the soft rock			0
as the base of the cliff becomes smaller and weaker , it is no longer able to support the weight above it , and this is when the overhang is at risk of crashing into the sea			0
the cliffs at @entity7 are red sandstone , and interestingly are harder at the bottom			2
three or four metres up the rock is softer as there is less stone content			0
many cliffs in the south west of the @entity70 are described as ' soft ' - often chalky rock or sandstone , whereas many cliffs in the north are granite and described as ' hard '			0
- information provided to @entity77 by the @entity78 the @entity78 has £ 570,000 ready to spend extending the sea defences here - but wo n't spend it unless tiny @entity41 provides a consultant 's report and pays survey costs			1
the council , the smallest in the country , says it can not afford that , and that the government will need to step in and find the extra funds			2
@entity90 and @entity8 mp @entity91 said the council 's decision was ' utterly ridiculous			1
the landlord of the hotel , @entity96 , said the property lost 13ft of garden in three months last winter and said if the cliff was not shored up the hotel would fall into the sea			1
he said : ' i ca n't do anything			1
' all i have got to do is sit here and wait for it to fall in			0
' it 's just a matter of time before the erosion reaches the hotel			0
' it does depend on the high tides and the winters , because obviously we 've had a nice summer so the ground has hardened			0
' then you get the high tides , the storms and it just starts cracking again - that 's the problem			0
' senior councillor , @entity121 , said : ' we have been faced with an impossible combination of circumstances - extraordinarily tight deadlines and substantial financial risks			0
' it 's not very hopeful for the hotel and everybody at @entity41 very much regrets that			2
' we have made every effort to help the hotel up till now , but we can not help anymore i 'm afraid			0
' the hotel was forced to close its children 's play area which backs onto the cliffs and it was moved at a cost of £ 800,000 - but now that is back in danger he said the risks included the council having to underwrite the project financially and meet consultation and procurement rules within a stated deadline			1
some £ 11,500 has already been spent by the local authority on the first stages of the application for @entity78 money			2
conservative mp mr @entity91 said the council 's lack of involvement is ridiculous			1
' the hotel and possibly the road could go into the sea , which would be a disaster , ' he said			0
' but the original report that was done by @entity41 the @entity78 quite rightly threw out ; it was appalling			2
a plan to build a flood defence wall to keep the @entity8 hotel from falling into the sea has been abandoned the @entity5 in @entity7 could be lost to coastal erosion after funding for a rescue plan was withdrawn by authorities the cliffs that support the @entity5 are made of red sandstone and are being worn away by a coastal erosion process called abrasion ' so now they have taken the easy route and just said , well if it falls into the sea , it falls into the sea			1
' not acceptable ! you can not have the coastline of @entity8 held hostage by a council that does n't care			1
' i am not prepared to tolerate this shirking of responsibility on such a crucial issue as this and i am taking up the matter immediately at ministerial level with a request that @entity8 be forced to progress the scheme			0
' the final decision will be made at a council meeting on december 17 , but the recommendation is that the council halts the bidding process .			0
