a @entity1 elementary school principal has come under fire from parents after banning her teachers from assigning their pupils any homework			1
according to local news site @entity7 , @entity8 , who is the principal at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , sent a letter home to the parents of all pre-k through fifth grade students informing them that the school 's teachers would no longer be assigning work for the children to do outside of school hours			1
she suggested that her students ' time would be better spent focusing on other , more enjoyable , activities such as playing video games , watching tv or spending time outside			1
' they include : children 's frustration and exhaustion , lack of time for other activities and family time and , sadly for many , loss of interest in learning			2
' ms @entity8 added that she was ' excited that we are redefining the landscape of homework ' , before going on to explain that she did n't believe she was ' eliminating ' homework , but rather adjusting the expectations of both her parents and her pupils in terms of what that phrase means			1
but while her students are no doubt delighted at the news , their parents are less enthused by the school 's decision			0
' i was just thinking maybe i 'll keep my daughter here for another year , but this pushed me over the edge , ' @entity71 , the father of a second grade pupil at the school , told @entity7			0
' this is their time to learn now , when they have good memory , ' said @entity83 , the parent of a third grade pupil at @entity32			2
' i give him extra work , though			0
i go to @entity86 and @entity87 and give him my own homework			0
' ironically , the school 's mission statement - which available on its website - states clearly that pupils are expected to ' achieve high academic standards ' and to ' take responsibility for their own learning '			2
homework - free zone : parents of the school 's students are angry at ms @entity8 's decision , with one father going as far as to say he would pull his daughter from her class ' our school , @entity32 116 , is a community of learners in which all children are encouraged to achieve high academic standards and social success , to enjoy learning , to celebrate diversity , to develop analytical skills , and to model exemplary behavior , ' the website explains			1
' we empower our students to take responsibility for their own learning by recognizing that effort leads to academic success			0
' they are active participants and every child has a responsibility not just to perform a task , but to do it to the best of her or his ability			0
' but despite the anger and frustration being voiced by many parents however , ms @entity8 is adamant that she has made the best decision possible for pupils and added that she is ' looking forward ' to seeing what ' positive impact ' the school 's new homework options will have on both the students - and their parents			1
and according to @entity140 , associate executive director at @entity141 , ms @entity8 's theory is actually not as bizarre as some of the school parents might think			2
speaking to @entity144 about @entity32 116 's new homework policy , mr @entity140 explained that , while children need ' the opportunity to apply what they have learned after they leave the school environment ' , that additional education time does n't necessarily have to take the more traditional form of worksheets and book - based assignments			1
' when kids engage in rough and tumble play outdoors , " big body play " we call it , they 're not only enhancing their physical development , they 're learning how to set limits in a social - emotional context , problem solve , and make decisions , ' he added			0
' these skills hit all the domains of learning			0

@entity8 , the principal of @entity12 - based @entity32 116 , informed parents last month that children would no longer be assigned any homework
she suggested that pupils ' time would be better spent pursuing other , more enjoyable activities , such as watching tv or playing video games
