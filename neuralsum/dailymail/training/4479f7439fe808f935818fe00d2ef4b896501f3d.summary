a diet high in omega - 3 fatty acids can help preserve memory and thinking abilities a @entity5 diet low in red meat and dairy food and high in omega - 3 fatty acids can help preserve memory and thinking abilities , say researchers			1
scientists in the @entity11 studied the diets of 17,478 people with an average age of 64			0
participants were given tests that measured mental ability over an average of four years			0
during the course of the study , seven per cent developed memory and thinking deficits			1
the study found people who more closely followed a @entity5 diet had a 19 per cent reduced risk of mental impairment			1
a key element of the @entity5 diet is omega - 3 fatty acids , found in oily fish , flax seed , walnuts and pulses , which are known to benefit the brain and nervous system			1
the diet typically also contains high levels of fresh fruit and vegetables and low levels of saturated fat			2
the findings are published in the latest issue of the journal @entity44			0
lead researcher dr @entity45 , from the universities of @entity47 in the @entity11 and @entity48 in @entity49 , said : ' since there are no definitive treatments for most dementing illnesses , modifiable activities , such as diet , that may delay the onset of symptoms of dementia are very important			0
' diet is an important modifiable activity that could help in preserving cognitive functioning in late life			0
however , it is only one of several important lifestyle activities that might play a role in late - life mental functioning			2
exercise , avoiding obesity , not smoking cigarettes and taking medications for conditions like diabetes and hypertension are also important			0
' other recent research found that eating a @entity5 - style diet can cut heart attacks , strokes and death rates in people at high risk of heart disease by as much as a third			1
other recent research found that a @entity5 diet could be as good as statins at cutting the risk of heart disease changing the balance of foods in a diet can lessen the risk even before heart - related illness strikes , according to a major clinical trial			1
previous studies have compared the effects of the diet on people after they have suffered a heart attack or stroke â€“ with many showing improved heart health			2
but this research , published online by the @entity102 , was the first to rigorously test the effects on a high - risk group			2
in fact , the study of around 7,500 people was halted early , after almost five years , because the results were so clear it would have been unethical not to recommend the diet to all those taking part .			0
