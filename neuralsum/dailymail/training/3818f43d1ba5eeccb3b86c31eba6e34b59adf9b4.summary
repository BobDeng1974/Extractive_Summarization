afterwards , manager @entity13 accused @entity15 boss @entity14 of showing a lack of respect , with words exchanged on the benches following the goal and @entity5 's first - team coach @entity21 sent to the stands before the @entity23 then refused to shake hands at the final whistle			1
@entity0 shows his frustration during 's @entity3 's defeat at @entity5 on tuesday @entity0 appeared to take the defeat by the @entity11 side worse than most and has now spoken out @entity30 defender @entity0 insists the players must shoulder their share of the responsibility for what was a below - par performance on a damp night in @entity35			1
' it was not acceptable			2
i would firstly like to apologise to the fans , they did n't deserve this			2
that is not us , ' @entity0 told @entity3 's official @entity44 channel			1
' given the last games we have lost , we played and we showed that we are better than the opposition and we had the opportunities to win and deserved more from the games			2
' but after tuesday night , i am disappointed obviously and i am angry because we had a great opportunity to go and do something special and we just blew it			0
' everyone needs to take responsibility , not hide in their shell			0
we must stand up and be counted because there 's another game in the @entity57 and we need to stop this bad run			2
@entity5 midfielder @entity9 ( second right ) bundled the ball into the net for the winning goal @entity9 and his team - mates can now look forward to a semi-final date , and are one round from @entity65 ' the minimum we can do is try our maximum and give everything that we can , but it was disappointing because i think we should have done much better			1
' i just want to apologise to the fans , because they did n't deserve it			0
' we will be working harder to make sure this never happens again			0
it is an opportunity lost , but there is still a long season ahead			0

for the last five years we 've been playing football , ' the defender said			0
' we 've opened teams up with one - twos , crosses in the box , playing out of defence , and we changed everything and i do n't understand why			2
' we 've spoke about it and we need to take responsibility , come and get the ball , do what we do , play the way we normally play and that 's the way we believe we can win			0
we did n't do that			0
' we did n't create enough changes because we did n't match their desire			0
