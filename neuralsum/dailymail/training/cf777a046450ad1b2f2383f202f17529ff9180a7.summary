a 3.7 - metre saltwater crocodile which had a penchant for taunting @entity3 children every time the bell rang at a school on the very northern tip of @entity7 has finally been caught			1
' shorty ' the maneater would lurk in the waters near @entity10 in @entity11 looking for his next victim during school breaks - but fortunately for the students he was fenced off from the school grounds			1
shorty would habitually crawl from the @entity18 bed near the @entity19 and peer through the fence			0
but schoolkids no longer need to be on the look - out at lunchtime after the maneater was captured by wildlife			0
however his larger friend , a 4.5m saltwater beast , is still on the loose and the rangers have now pegged him as the region 's most wanted croc			0
@entity16 , the maneating monster , was captured by rangers from a primary school at remote @entity7 community just 30km from the tip of the country gotcha : @entity16 was causing a nuisance around the @entity10 in north @entity7 having been sighted when the school bell was rung @entity10 is located just 30km south of the top of @entity3 at @entity11 and is regarded as a haven for saltwater crocodiles ranger coordinator @entity45 said he was n't ' surprised ' when he heard the croc was tempted by the sound of the ringing bell			1
' i heard the story when we captured it ... but it did n't surprise anybody , he knew the habits of the school around bell time , ' mr @entity45 told @entity56			2
he believed the main reason behind @entity16 's unwanted , yet prompt arrival at bell time would likely have been because he was scouring around for a meal			1
' that 's what you would associate it with			0
' caught using a float trap , it took three days to lure @entity16 into his cage where a big piece of meat awaited him			1
the trap was configured so that when the 3.7 - metre monster bit down on his dinner , the steel trap 's door closed behind him			0
on the hunt : rangers tow the caught croc to safety after he had been been sighted on numerous occasions around for the @entity10 , in the background using a float trap , the rangers managed to entice the croc inside using a large piece of bait which was configured so the trap door would shut when he ate it a ranger transfers the croc from his river trap , to a more stable structure which was used to transfer him to the @entity94 where he will be part of a breeding program he was then pulled out of the water and taken to a nearby crocodile breeding facility			1
@entity56 has made repeated attempts to contact the school , without success			0
a @entity103 spokesperson said because of the common occurrence of crocodiles near the school , children have been told to take ' extra care around waterways ' and ' exercise crocwise behaviour at all times '			2
about 100 students attend the school , which is fenced - off from the nearby creek where the crocs predominantly roam			1
the department has detailed a list of croc savvy tips for the school to skill up on in an effort to avoid becoming victim to the natural born predators			2
however , they are used as a guide only , and the department has assured @entity56 that at no times are children at danger at @entity10 when they go about their daily routine			1
' at no stage are students at the school in danger from crocodiles while they go about their daily routine at the school			2
' ' the school grounds are separated from the creek by a public walkway and the school fence			0
' the wildlife management team celebrate the crocs eventual capture there are reports of numerous crocodiles hanging inside the @entity19 at @entity11			0

' @entity16 ' crept around a *small* , remote @entity7 school and was sighted when its bell rang
rangers say he treated the school bell as a signal that it was time to be fed
@entity10 *campus* has 100 students located near a river *infested* with crocs
education department assures children are ' safe ' at all times
he was caught using a float trap , and taken to a crocodile breeding facility
