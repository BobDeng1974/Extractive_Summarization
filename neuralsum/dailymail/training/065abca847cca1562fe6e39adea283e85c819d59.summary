@entity0 always said it was mission impossible and so it proved			1
no - one , it seems , goes unbeaten in @entity5 throughout a season these days			1
@entity6 still has at least one up on his nemesis			0
@entity9 ’s @entity8 , the team which two months ago looked an abject parody of a @entity12 side , achieved what many believed to be impossible – and they did so in some style			1
they survived a torrid opening thirty minutes , when @entity16 looked to be at their formidable best ; they survived losing their goalkeeper at half - time and bringing on a 21 - year - old debutant ; and they survived playing out the closing exchanges with 10 men			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity23 scored twice in the second half as @entity8 inflicted @entity16 's first @entity12 defeat this season it was a frustrating afternoon for @entity0 ( left ) and his @entity12 leaders as they were beaten in the north east substitute @entity23 was the hero for @entity8 as they strengthened their push towards the @entity31 places @entity8 's midfield engine of @entity33 and @entity34 share a smile with manager @entity9 a delighted @entity9 shakes hands with @entity16 manager @entity0 after his team 's victory at @entity39 @entity8 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity40 6 ( @entity41 46mins , 7.5 ) , @entity42 7.5 , @entity43 7.5 , @entity44 9 , @entity45 8 , @entity46 7.5 , @entity34 8 , @entity47 6 ( @entity23 53 , 8.5 ) , @entity33 8 , @entity48 7 ( @entity49 ) , @entity50 8 subs not used : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 scorer ( s ) : @entity23 57 , 78 booked : @entity46 , @entity33 sent off : @entity43 81 @entity16 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity57 6 , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 5 , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 67 ) , @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 ( @entity66 67 ) , @entity67 5.5 ( @entity68 61 ) , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 5.5 subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 scorer ( s ) : @entity66 83 booked : @entity64 , @entity70 , @entity68 @entity77 : @entity44 9 referee : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) attendance : 52,019 ratings by @entity83 at @entity39 @entity23 scored his second goal at the end of a swift counter attack - click here for match zone from @entity39 and when the fourth official @entity91 signalled for six minutes of stoppage time at the end , there were howls of protest around an indignant @entity39			1
a famous victory looked to be in doubt			0
the sense that , given enough time , @entity16 would rectify the deficit , was inescapable			1
and given how well @entity8 had played , that would have been hard to bear			1
quite how @entity9 had turned around the shambolic team that looked so dreadful when they lost at @entity104 is one of the season ’s mysteries			2
it was n’t that they clung on to a win ; they matched @entity16 and , while having periods where they had to defend , at times were the better team			1
the discipline , shape and determination were exemplary – @entity23 will take the plaudits for is two goals after coming off the bench , but it is the engine room comprised of @entity34 , @entity33 and – enjoying an authentic champagne moment – @entity46 who provided the platform for this win			1
it did n’t look to be shaping up that way early on			0
there is something a little ominous about @entity16 when they slowly move through the gears and began to open up the throttle			1
the opening 30 minutes had that feel			2
slowly , surely , they were overhauling @entity8			1
the sheer speed of the passing , the quality of the link - ups looked to have the home side on the back foot			2
@entity23 gave @entity8 the lead in the 57th minute against the @entity12 leaders at @entity39 the @entity143 striker slotted home a low cross from the left wing past @entity57 and into the back of the net the goal was @entity23 's sixth of the @entity12 season and second inside a week after his strike against @entity154 on tuesday @entity8 manager @entity9 celebrates @entity23 's first goal , which broke the deadlock at @entity39 mins @entity158 @entity8 total 114.7 71.3 @entity34 90 12.4 7.7 @entity46 90 11.9 7.4 @entity50 90 11.4 7.1 @entity16 total 113.4 70.4 @entity64 90 12.8 8.0 @entity69 90 11.0 7.2 @entity63 90 10.8 6.7 data courtesy of the @entity160 , the @entity161 of the @entity12 there was the shot from @entity65 just wide on 11 minutes , which came after the slickest multi-pass build imaginable , with @entity16 simply weaving their way through their opponents			1
@entity69 dashed down the left wing on 14 minutes , causing consternation , but shot wide			2
@entity59 then headed just over from a @entity64 corner			2
@entity65 then had a delightful curling shot just wide on 19 minutes and @entity64 was tipped away by @entity40			2
@entity16 test every facet of your game			2
be it skill or physicality , strength in the air or sheer power , they stretch you in all departments			0
it seemed only a matter of time before they unpicked @entity8			2
and yet , @entity9 ’s team hung on in			0
@entity33 and @entity34 in particular refused to give the game up for lost			0
bit by bit , they worked their way back into the game			0
they never lost their shape , each and every player pressing when required and strong in the challenge when necessary			0
eventually , their endurance began to pay some dividends			0
on 33 minutes they produced a delightful moment when @entity48 played in a ball for the impressive @entity50			0
the @entity200 held the ball up and played it in for @entity34 who was through on goal , only for @entity57 to rush from his line to smother the ball			0
@entity8 ’s progress might have been undone at half - time , however , with keeper @entity40 , already a stand in for @entity209 , unable to continue			1
on came @entity210 , 21 and the brother of @entity212 , for a debut in the most testing circumstances imaginable			0
he started well , however : flattening @entity70 as he came for his first punch			0
@entity8 continued to hold their own , though @entity63 should have put @entity16 ahead on 56 minutes , heading wide from a @entity64 free - kick with a clear sight of goal			1
@entity23 scored a second from a swift @entity8 counter-attack in the 78th minute as he slotted into a empty net with goalkeeper @entity57 out of position , @entity23 slotted into the empty net past the helpless @entity59 and @entity62 substitute @entity66 scored in the 83rd minute as he headed in a free - kick to give @entity16 hope @entity66 celebrates his goal after coming off the bench with @entity16 in danger of defeat at 2 - 0 behind @entity43 was sent off in the final 10 minutes after picking up a second yellow card , and @entity8 had to play with 10 men @entity8 goalkeeper @entity231 picked up an injury just before half - time and was unable to continue young goalkeeper @entity210 came on to replace @entity231 at half - time in his debut for @entity8 but slowly the limited vulnerabilities of @entity16 begun to show – and they can be penetrated when confronted by the quickest of attackers			1
@entity33 led the charge on 57 minutes , sprinting away before releasing @entity48 on the right			0
his cross should have been cut out by @entity60 but he allowed it through to @entity23 , who had only been on the pitch for four minutes , to score from close range with his first touch			1
certainly in terms of possession they were impressive			0
but despite sending on @entity66 , the chances never came			2
on 77 minutes , @entity69 hit the post , which was as close as it got			0
and yet within a minute , they were further behind			0
@entity34 , hugely impressive , first won the ball in midfield and then drove on to release @entity33 , who was through on goal			0
@entity57 came out to block but the ball deflected into the path of @entity23 , on hand , to steer in his second of the game			2
finally , a subdued @entity39 erupted			2
this was turning into an outstanding performance ; and then @entity43 , in his eagerness , jeopardised it , scything through @entity68 in the 81st minute			1
it was a clear red card , and barely a protest was registered			0
from the free - kick on 83 minutes , @entity64 curled the ball in and @entity210 , excellent until then , failed to come and collect , and @entity66 simply headed home			1
@entity210 would redeem himself – saves from @entity70 and @entity62 in the dying minutes saved his team			0
his day , his manager ’s day was complete			0
@entity8 earned their win – and @entity0 ’s invincibles are no more			1
@entity8 midfielder @entity34 puts pressure on @entity16 midfielder @entity65 as he tries to win possession @entity16 's @entity274 striker @entity70 is left on the floor after a challenge during the first half @entity70 snatches at a half - chance from a low cross by @entity65 as he smashes over the bar while under pressure from @entity43 @entity16 forward @entity70 is tackled by @entity8 's @entity45 and sent tumbling to the ground			1

@entity23 scored both goals as @entity8 beat @entity16 at @entity39

@entity23 opened the scoring in the 57th minute before adding a second in the 78th
@entity43 was sent off with 10 minutes to play after picking up a second yellow card
@entity66 headed in a free - kick in 83rd minute to give @entity16 hope
