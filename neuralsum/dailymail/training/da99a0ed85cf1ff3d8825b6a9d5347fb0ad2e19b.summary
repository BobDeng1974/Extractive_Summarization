the @entity0 gives too much weight to pro-immigration voices and ‘ almost totally ignores ’ the negative social impact of multiculturalism , a new study has claimed			1
the corporation suffers from left wing ‘ groupthink ’ that prevents its journalists from challenging institutional bias and results in pro-immigration ‘ propaganda ’ , according to the research published yesterday			0
it was also accused of ‘ downplaying ’ violence by @entity16 while being happy to criticise @entity17 and report on the activities of other violent extremists			0
the @entity0 has been accused of ' downplaying ' violence by @entity16 after a report which analysed its coverage since 1997 the report , by independent think - tank @entity23 , looked at coverage by @entity25 and current affairs programmes since 1997			1
it comes as the @entity0 undertakes an ‘ impartiality review ’ by former @entity29 and @entity30 executive @entity28 to see whether it gives ‘ due weight ’ to a full range of opinion on controversial topics , such as immigration			1
the study ’s author , @entity36 , concluded : ‘ in its coverage of the topic of immigration , the @entity0 has given overwhelmingly greater weight to pro-migration voices , even though they represent a minority – even elitist – viewpoint			1
‘ and in its coverage of the economic arguments for and against immigration , it has devoted somewhat more space to pro-migration voices			0
‘ in terms of the social costs , the @entity0 has almost totally ignored certain areas			1
the more awkward a subject is for polite society to deal with , the less coverage the @entity0 gives it			0
’ he added : ‘ it would be no exaggeration to say that a foreigner who subscribed only to the @entity0 might visit this country and be blissfully unaware of many of the social problems associated with immigration			2
’ according to the study , it is ‘ common practice ’ for the @entity0 to give a platform to multiple pro-immigration spokesmen with no dissenting voices			1
mr @entity36 said : ‘ between 1997 and 2013 , of the hundreds of immigration news reports that i have personally watched , listened to and read , in literally just a handful have anti-immigration voices not been outnumbered			2
’ the report was particularly scathing about a @entity74 article on ‘ @entity75 ’ published in 2002			0
the article said the idea of the ‘ scrounging , bogus asylum seeker ’ was a ‘ misconception ’ , while opponents of mass immigration were guilty of ‘ racism , political opportunism , misinformation , media mischief - making and sheer cowardice ’ as well as genuine concern			0
mr @entity36 said : ‘ however laudable its intentions may be , a feature like this – which presents only one side of the argument – is propaganda			0
’ he said @entity0 bias was often unintentional or provoked by ‘ basic decency ’ and a desire to protect the underdog			1
in the wake of the @entity100 killing last week , the study accused the @entity0 of failing to report accurately on violence by @entity16 fundamentalists but he said by focussing on personalised , emotive cases of asylum seekers and immigration success stories , the @entity0 failed to cover the views of ‘ working class natives ’ or to ask awkward questions about the difficulties of integration			1
damagingly , in the wake of the @entity100 killing last week , the study accused the @entity0 of failing to report accurately on violence by @entity16 fundamentalists			2
it said : ‘ in contrast to violence perpetrated by white - skinned extremists , the @entity0 tends to downplay any violent activity on the part of extremists			0
’ it added : ‘ the @entity0 feels uncomfortable tackling @entity16 extremism or aggression by minorities ; it feels more at ease to see @entity123 as victims of racism or @entity126			2
’ in 2010 , the @entity0 ’s then director general @entity127 accepted the corporation had once been guilty of a ‘ massive ’ left - wing bias and admitted its coverage of immigration and @entity132 had been ‘ weak ’			1
he said : ‘ the @entity0 does n’t always get it right			0
i think there are some areas , immigration , business and @entity132 where the @entity0 has historically been rather weak and rather nervous about letting that entire debate happen			0
in 2007 , a @entity140 report into the @entity0 ’s impartiality found the corporation had self - censored subjects it found unpalatable			2
the @entity0 said coverage of immigration is ‘ impartial and balanced ’ , but @entity145 are carrying out a review to see if ‘ due weight ’ is given to a range of opinions on hot topics .			1
