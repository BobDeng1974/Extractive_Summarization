@entity0 accused his @entity2 team of failing to perform as they slumped in @entity4 and returned home with @entity6 at the centre of another injury scare			1
@entity6 twisted his right ankle near the end of the 2 - 0 defeat and @entity0 admitted he was concerned because it is the same joint which ruled him out of action for 17 months			1
' it 's difficult to say how bad it is , ' said the @entity2 manager			1
' normally it would not be too bad but i am a bit cautious because of his history			0
' @entity2 's @entity6 went down injured late on to add to @entity0 's mounting problems @entity6 has injured his right ankle , which has been problematic for him over the past two years @entity0 conceded that his side were second best against @entity4 on tuesday night injuries are piling up on @entity2 and a blow to @entity6 will deepen the gloom after their @entity27 campaign got off to a poor start , as they were deservedly beaten by the @entity29			1
' it was a difficult night , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity4 were the better team			1
we had a disappointing performance			0
it is difficult to go into individual assessment of any player because as a team were not at the required level			2
' still the paradox of the night is that we had very good chances to score first			1
we were caught on two counter-attacks			0
for the first , we lost the ball 80 metres from our goal			2
there were enough people to stop the goal			0
we were still three - against - one at the back			0
it 's difficult to understand how we conceded the goal			1
' @entity50 scores @entity4 's first goal which @entity0 said it was difficult to understand @entity53 made it 2 - 0 early in the second period once again on the counter-attack @entity2 were overwhelmed in midfield , conceding two goals in a three - minute period either side of half - time			1
it could have been many more as @entity0 's team were punished by their fast counter-attacking opponents			1
@entity50 scored the first and @entity53 the second			2
@entity53 also hit the bar			0
' they were very strong in midfield , stronger than us , i agree , ' said @entity0 , who also defended @entity69 , his new Â£ 16million signing who missed a clear chance to open the scoring			1
' he will improve , ' said @entity0			2
' i do n't think we have to make a problem of that			0
he had a lively first half , two or three good chances ; one obvious one			1
we have to be a bit patient maybe			0
' video disappointed @entity0 bemoans counter-attacks @entity2 's new striker @entity69 had the @entity82 ' best chance at 0 - 0 but slid the ball wide @entity69 needs more time according to his new boss @entity0 who asked for patience for the striker @entity4 unleashed a barrage of 23 shots at @entity2 's goal			1
@entity89 apologised to fans on @entity91 and captain @entity92 said : ' we faced a top side at one of the toughest stadiums in @entity97			0
they have a lot of pace up front and we gave the ball away too many times			0
they took the game where they wanted to take it			0
' teenage right - back @entity106 started his first @entity2 game in the absence of injured defenders @entity110 and @entity111 and @entity112 who had tonsillitis and was an unused substitute			1
@entity4 were also hit by injuries , with many players missing , but the victory puts them in control of @entity119 and @entity120 drew 1 - 1 in the other game			2
@entity0 pinned the blame on his players after another game where @entity125 failed to shine ' i am very pleased , ' said @entity4 boss @entity127			1
' three players went out of the team because of muscle problems but we made some decisions and i have to say it was a great performance by the team			0
' we were brave , we were fast and that is everything we needed for this game			0
we had other chances but two - nil is perfect for us against a strong opponent			2
i enjoyed it from the first second until the last			0
to see games like this , it is the best in the world			0
we play this quickly it 's very hard to defend against			0
' @entity2 's next test is at home to @entity120 in a fortnight .			2
