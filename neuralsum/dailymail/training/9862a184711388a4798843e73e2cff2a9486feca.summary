by @entity0 for @entity1 a skilful artist has brought his selfies to life - by sketching himself into the picture to make the photographs look like paintings			1
@entity8 , 33 , from @entity9 , first came up with the idea when he wanted to update his @entity12 profile picture and has since developed a quirky collection of images			1
after taking a self - portrait , the digital artist started to sketch himself into the picture			1
but rather than completely transforming his pictures into a complete sketch , the artist only partially adapted the original pictures , creating an interesting composite effect			0
this is then used to make the photographs appear in part like black and white paintings			1
he said : ' my grandmother taught me to draw , and by watching her drawing and painting made me want to do the same			1
' it 's always important to remember the history behind an image , as it helps to produce a quality image			2
' when i make a creative image , i try to attract the attention of the viewer and hold it			1
' he said : ' my grandmother taught me to draw , and by watching her drawing and painting made me want to do the same ' the whole process , from the shooting to the final image , can take a few hours to several days			1
he said : ' the pencil strokes are fast and nervous , and so give the impression of a construction			0
' then , my " dodge and burn " effect is used a lot in the final rendering			2
' it is in fact a multitude of brush strokes , black or white , which serve to highlight , or rather mitigate some facial features , and clothing			1
' this treatment is intended to look like a little more like a painting than a photo			0
this allows me to make it more pleasant to the eye			2
' he added : ' all my pictures are taken inside my apartment , using only natural light			0
' the drawings are done with a simple pencil on a sheet of paper			0
then the drawing is scanned , cleaned and added to the picture with @entity84 tools			2
' i take thousands of images using a remote control , and then choose a selection of my favourites			0
' following his sketching success , mr @entity8 now hopes to to develop his series further			0
he said : ' i have many more creative and innovative ideas in my head and they will be challenging			0
but i hope i will be successful in achieving them all			0
