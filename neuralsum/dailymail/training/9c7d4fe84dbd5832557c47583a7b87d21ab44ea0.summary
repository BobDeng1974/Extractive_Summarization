by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 3 january 2013 small firms are being frozen out of the £ 80billion attempt to kick - start lending , the @entity1 warned yesterday			1
despite being the backbone of the economy and a major employer , they are not benefiting from the scheme the @entity1 is running with the government			1
the first major analysis into the ‘ funding for lending ’ initiative does show , however , that it has ‘ significantly ’ increased funding for large firms and homeowners wanting a mortgage			1
warning : the @entity1 has said that small firms are being frozen out of the £ 80billion attempt to kick start lending but experts yesterday warned it was ‘ worrying ’ and ‘ disappointing ’ that small firms are being excluded when they are key to stopping @entity22 slipping back into recession			1
the @entity24 has consistently highlighted the plight of small businesses struggling to get the money to expand , launching our make the @entity30 campaign in july 2010			1
under the @entity34 scheme , banks and building societies can borrow an unlimited amount of money for as little as 0.25 per cent			1
but they have to maintain or increase their lending levels			0
they must use the money to lend to those needing funds , including businesses of all sizes , homeowners or first - time buyers needing a mortgage			0
but the @entity1 ’s latest ‘ credit conditions ’ survey , published yesterday , showed how lenders continue to have a separate rule book for small firms			1
it said : ‘ overall , credit availability to the corporate sector was reported to have increased significantly [ between september and december ] , the first reported rise in availability for a year			0
‘ this was reflected in a significant increase in availability for medium - sized firms , an increase in availability for large firms and a slight increase for small firms			2
’ the problem will continue , the @entity1 went on to warn			2
it stated : ‘ looking ahead to january – march 2013 , lenders expected a further increase in credit availability to the corporate sector as a whole			0
‘ this mainly reflected an increase in credit availability for large and medium - sized firms			0
’ @entity73 , the shadow business secretary , expressed dismay at the report to make matters worse , it said , interest rates , fees and commission charged by banks are not falling for small firms although they are for medium and large firms			2
@entity73 , the shadow business secretary , expressed dismay at the report			0
‘ we need to ensure that entrepreneurs , those taking risks and creating jobs and growth , receive all the support they need , so that small businesses can grow , take on employees and drive growth , ’ he said			1
‘ it is disappointing the @entity1 ’s survey finds that small firms are still paying over the odds to access finance			2
’ @entity99 , chief @entity22 economist at @entity100 , said : ‘ it is slightly worrying that it is the smaller companies that appear to be benefiting the least from the improving credit situation			0
’ @entity103 , managing partner of @entity104 , which invests in small firms , said : ‘ once again , this data confirms that funds are getting through to bigger businesses but not the smaller firms that need them most			2
’ last month , @entity110 , the business secretary , declared he was fed up with ‘ the chronic lack of lending by the banks to our small businesses ’			1
he said : ‘ this is hurting many successful companies and strangling growth			0
‘ as i go round the country , i am constantly meeting outstanding small businesses desperate to get credit from high - street banks – and failing to do so			1
something needs to be done			0
’ as well as the bank lending scheme , the government is giving money to ‘ peer - to - peer lenders ’ , such as @entity128 , which allow people to lend directly to firms			0
a typical business borrows £ 60,000 from between 300 and 400 investors , who receive an average interest rate of 9.1 per cent .			0
