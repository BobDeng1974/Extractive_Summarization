by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 12 july 2013 a @entity2 engineer has defied gravity in a human - powered helicopter to scoop a long - standing international aeronautical prize			1
the team from the @entity7 has made aviation history to win the long standing @entity9 with a flight lasting 64 seconds and reaching an altitude of 3.3 metres			1
@entity12 , 31 , provided the pedal power for the crazy aircraft to make the first ever sustained flight of a human - powered helicopter			1
@entity12 ( pictured ) provided the pedal power for the crazy aircraft to make the first ever sustained flight of a human - powered helicopter the @entity24 began in 1980 to find the first successful human - powered helicopter that can fly over three metres in height while hovering for at least one minute in an area of ten square metres			1
the $ 250,000 prize has not been awarded since the competition began and creative engineers have been competing for the title for over three decades - with very few coming close to winning			1
@entity33 , a team made up of past and present students from the @entity7 , competed with a team from @entity37 in a bid to take the coveted prize			2
the team 's helicopter , nicknamed @entity42 , measures 47 metres across but weighs just 54 kilograms			1
the super light - weight frame is made of carbon fibre tubes that connect the four rotors to the central bike , used to power the hand - made aircraft			2
it relies on the pilot 's physical strength to keep it airborne			2
mr @entity12 said : ' as you spin your legs , you 're spinning the rotors			0
' it 's very much an exercise in mental and physical control , at the same time as an all - out physical effort , ' according to the @entity59			0
despite the huge amount of physical exertion , he described hovering in the air as an ' incredible feeling '			0
mr @entity12 said : ' this is n't something that you 're going to commute to work in any time soon , but it 's an exercise in really pushing the limits on what 's physically possible , and what you can do with lightweight materials and really creative design			2
' ' winning this competition really is a catalyst to keep doing the things we love			0
' our goal is to take on projects that really inspire people to follow big dreams ' the small @entity2 team worked on the helicopter for more than a year and endured plenty of slow changes to perfect the prize - winning design as well as two crashes that wiped out their work each time			2
the team 's chief structural engineer , @entity91 , said : ' i hope that this inspires not only our fellow @entity2 , but also global citizens to do more with less			1
' the team said : ' we came into this very confident that we were capable of winning this prize			0
' we realized that the prize was a lot more difficult than we originally anticipated , but at every step we were able to overcome the difficulty and get even closer and closer to the prize			0

professor @entity117 of the university 's engineering department , said : ' this is a tremendous accomplishment			0
' it is a great technological achievement , requiring ingenuity , knowledge , and experience in a number of challenging technical areas			0
' through accomplishing such a challenging feat , @entity12 and @entity91 have provided tremendous inspiration for young engineers both in @entity2 and around the world			0
' mr @entity12 and mr @entity91 have set up a company called @entity33 and plan on developing different human - powered vehicles			1
they hope that human - powered vehicles will be seen as a viable alternative or supplement to those burning fossil fuels			1
it is not the duo 's first record - breaking win			0
in 2010 they created a human - powered ornithopter called @entity145 - an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings - and made aviation history by achieving human - powered bird - like flight			1
the @entity2 team are the first to win the @entity24 which began in 1980			0
the team including mr @entity12 ( pictured ) managed to fly over three metres in height while hovering for at least one minute in an area of ten square metres to scoop the $ 250,000 prize			1

the @entity33 team 's human - powered helicopter won the $ 250,000 @entity9 with a flight lasting 64 seconds and over metres high
the team 's helicopter , nicknamed @entity42 , measures 47 metres across but weighs just 54 kilograms
engineer and pilot @entity12 made the first ever sustained flight of a human - powered helicopter
