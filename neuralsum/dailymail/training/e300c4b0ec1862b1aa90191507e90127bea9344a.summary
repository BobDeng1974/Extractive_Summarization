teenagers often use sex scenes in films as a ' script ' for their real - life sex - but @entity4 films tend to portray condoms as comical			1
a researcher found that watching screen sex led teenagers to use condoms less - and called for regulation			1
‘ one important observation from our evaluation of the films was that few showed contraceptive use or safe sexual practices , ’ researcher @entity20 from the @entity21 said			2
‘ when safe sex is portrayed in films , it is often in comedies and is presented as an inconvenience or embarrassment			1
' the motion picture industry could make an effort to show healthier , safer behaviors , just as they have reduced the amount of smoking shown in films			2
’ watching sex scenes in movies can make children more sexually active from a younger age , research suggests			2
watching sex on screen also makes teenagers less likely to use condoms , said @entity50			1
around 84 % of current @entity4 films contain sex - including series aimed at teenagers such as the @entity55 films			1
take more risks : watching sex on screen can influence a child 's personality and make them more prone to take risks the scenes can ' fundamentally influence a teenager 's personality ’ and make them more prone to take risks he said			2
dr @entity50 said : ‘ adolescents who are exposed to more sexual content in movies start having sex at younger ages , have more sexual partners and are less likely to use condoms with casual sexual partners			2
while there ’s been much research into the influence of drinking and smoking in movies , sex scenes has been overlooked			2
dr @entity20 said : ‘ much research has shown that adolescents ’ sexual attitudes and behaviours are influenced by media			0
' sexual scripts ' : teenagers look to films to work out how to behave in complex situations and do n't differentiate between what 's on the screen and daily life a survey of movies from 1950 - 2006 found that 84 per cent of movies contain sexual content			1
sexual content was found in : ‘ but the role of movies has been somewhat neglected , despite other findings that movies are more influential than tv or music			0
’ psychologists studied children aged 12 to 14 and then reviewed their sexual behaviour six years on			1
the research , published in @entity108 , followed 1,228 children over the six year period			0
dr @entity20 said adolescents often have a predisposition for ‘ sensation seeking ’ behaviour , which peaks between the ages of ten and 15 , and leads to a tendency to seek more novel and intense stimulation of all kinds			0
his team found that greater exposure to sexual content in movies at a young age actually led to a higher peak in sensation seeking during adolescence			0
the sensation seeking behaviour could last well into the late teens and early twenties if young people were exposed to movie sex scenes dr @entity20 said			0
he said : ‘ these movies appear to fundamentally influence their personality through changes in sensation seeking , which has far reaching implications for all of their risk taking behaviours			0
’ teenagers could also learn ‘ sexual scripts ’ from the films , using them as examples of how to behave when confronted with complex emotional situations			0
restricted viewing : while movies like @entity150 seem harmless , with scenes like this one between @entity152 and @entity153 , parents must restrict their children 's viewing given that for 57 per cent of @entity158 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16 , the media is their greatest source of sexual information , they often do n’t differentiate between what they see on the screen and what they must confront in daily life , dr @entity20 said			1
the researchers also looked at 684 high grossing films and analysed them for sexual content , such as heavy kissing or actual sex			0
most of the recent films did not portray safe sex , with little mention of using contraception			1
each teenager identified which movies they had seen from a list of 50 , randomly selected			0
six years later the teenagers were surveyed to find out how old they were when they became sexually active and how risky their sexual behaviour might have been			1
they were also asked if they used condoms consistently and whether they had multiple sexual partners			0
the findings revealed the link between exposure to sex on screen and sexual behaviour			1
dr @entity50 said : ‘ this study , and its confluence with other work , strongly suggests that parents need to restrict their children from seeing sexual content in movies at young ages			0

@entity4 films tend to show condoms as ' comical '
teenagers who watch films use scenes as a ' script '
could have impact on safe sex
studios ' should be forced ' to add condoms , in same way as on - screen smoking has been cut out
children aged 12 to 14 were studied and their sexual behaviour was reviewed six years later
