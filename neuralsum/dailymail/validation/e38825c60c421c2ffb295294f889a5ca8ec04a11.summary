whether it be in the boardroom or on the hunting ground , male competition can cause a sudden spike in testosterone levels			1
now a new study has found a link between testosterone and the caring side of men when they return home from the ' hunt '			1
the study revealed that the higher a man 's testosterone has risen during the day , the more the ' love hormone ' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home			1
the study was based on @entity18 people , who are an indigenous population of forager - farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of @entity24 's @entity23			1

researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle which revolves around small , tight - knit communities that produce their own food			1
' our goal was to look at the interaction between different hormones in motivating behaviour in a naturalistic context , ' said @entity48 , co-lead author at @entity49 , @entity49			0
the study revealed that the higher a man 's testosterone has risen during the day , the more the ' love hormone ' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home			1
the researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer , and linked with changes in testosterone ( pictured ) ' hunting for subsistence and sharing meat is something people have done for hundreds of thousands of years			1
' previous studies have shown that oxytocin makes people more cooperative while testosterone has the opposite effect			1
@entity48 said he expected to see a trade - off between the two hormones and was surprised to find the positive relationship between them			0
when a man tells his wife or girlfriend she looks nice , it ’s not because of her new haircut			2
instead , it ’s his hormones doing the talking			0
a study found that a whiff of the ‘ love chemical ’ oxytocin made men rate their partners as being more attractive			1
and @entity88 researchers recently said that oxytocin may also play a key role in monogamy , a trait that is rare among mammals , other than ourselves			1
the @entity96 scientists showed 40 young men who claimed to be passionately in love pictures of their partners			2
they were asked how attractive they found the women after being given a placebo spray to sniff and a burst of oxytocin			2
pictures of strangers and of long - term acquaintances , such as work colleagues were also shown			0
the men , who were in long - term relationships , also underwent scans to check how much the brain areas responsible for rewarding feelings lit up			2
lead author @entity112 said : ‘ when the men received the oxytocin instead of placebo , the reward system in the brain was very active when viewing their partner and they perceived them as more attractive than other women			1
‘ we did not detect this effect with pictures of long - standing acquaintances			0
’ according to @entity48 and co-lead author @entity125 , high testosterone while hunting could be attributed to a ' winner effect ' experienced by men making a kill			1
it could also be related to the status competition that hunting represents for traditional societies such as the @entity18			1
in either case , the increased oxytocin could serve as a balance to make the hunters kinder , more generous and more willing to share their bounty			0
' almost half a century ago , it was famously documented that successful @entity144 hunters were jokingly insulted by others in order to ' cool their hearts ' to ' make ( them ) gentle , ' lest pride or boasting disrupt the egalitarian social system common to many foragers , ' said senior co-author @entity148			0
' here we observe a potential hormonal analogue consistent with the type of levelling behaviour seen in hunter - gatherer societies			0
' another use for both hormones may have to do with post-hunt recovery			0
both are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity			0
' these men are coming home , they 're finished with work for the day , and they 're about to eat and share food , ' @entity48 continued			1
' so the need to be social coincides with the need to regenerate and it would make sense for the same hormones to facilitate both functions			0
' to conduct the study , @entity125 joined the hunters as they went out into the jungle and attempted to make a kill to feed their families			0
he then took saliva specimens along the way , collecting them at exact intervals			0
the oxytocin was measured in the @entity180			0
though the sample size is ' not huge , ' he and @entity48 noted , the study ' definitely adds to the current literature in which the interplay between testosterone and oxytocin is often overlooked			2
' ' i think the ' absence makes the heart grow fonder ' effect could potentially be very widespread , ' said @entity48			0
' reconnecting with their families after a day of separation would have been a very common challenge for men throughout evolutionary history , and oxytocin could help with that			1
' another interesting correlation , @entity125 noted , is that the average @entity18 hunt lasts eight and a half hours , roughly equivalent to a workday here			2
as well as helping partners reconnect after a day apart , oxytocin may have use in post-hunt recovery			2
both the love hormone and testosterone are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity			2

researchers tracked hormone levels of @entity18 people in @entity24
a day spent hunting for food caused a spike in testosterone level
the larger the spike , the more oxytocin a man produced on arrival home
increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer
