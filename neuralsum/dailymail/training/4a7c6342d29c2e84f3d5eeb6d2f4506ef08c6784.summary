by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 18 december 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 20 december 2013 the fairy lights will not go out on @entity3 's title tilt this @entity4 but recent history will count against them should they surrender top spot in the @entity8 this coming weekend			1
heading into the @entity13 period , @entity3 , @entity10 and @entity11 are all in with a shout of being top on @entity4 and there could hardly be a greater incentive - the last four title winners were also all top of the tree heading into the festive period			1
heading for the top : @entity10 's @entity22 celebrates scoring the opener during the 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity25 festive leaders @entity27 @entity28 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1993 3 @entity29 ... ... ... ... ... ...			1

@entity3 can guarantee their place at the summit with a win over @entity11 at the @entity45 on monday evening but should they falter , others could move in to seal the @entity47 1			2
@entity10 , who have scored 14 goals in their past three leagues games , will leapfrog @entity52 's side with victory at home to @entity55 on saturday lunchtime and - courtesy of a superior goal difference - they will remain there for @entity4 should @entity3 fail to defeat @entity11			1
as for @entity60 's side , they will only go top if they take all three points from the @entity45 and if @entity10 are unable to beat @entity55 on saturday			2
yet with just four points separating @entity3 in first and @entity65 in fifth , the title race has rarely been more difficult to call			2
last week 's humbling at @entity34 offered the first indications that the wheels may be coming off @entity3 's pursuit			2
the @entity70 appearing exhausted after a gruelling schedule pitted a saturday lunchtime kick - off at the @entity73 in the same week as assignments against @entity65 and at @entity75			0
for seasoned @entity3 followers though , defeat against @entity60 's @entity11 would feel so wearingly typical - @entity52 is still to defeat the @entity79 manager in nine previous meetings			1
fortunately for @entity3 , imperfections remain among their title rivals			2
@entity28 themselves continue to belie their majesty at the @entity73 with listless showings away from home , where they have conceded more than they have scored and a trip to @entity90 this weekend is exactly the kind of match they must negotiate to back up their flamboyant showing against @entity3			0
leading man : @entity3 boss @entity52 sniffing around : @entity10 manager @entity95 in with a shout : @entity11 chief @entity60 feeling @entity97 : @entity11 are within striking distance of the summit , but crashed out of the @entity100 last night after @entity102 's @entity101 ( second left ) scored the extra-time winner in @entity22 , @entity10 have the gift that keeps on giving but the next fortnight represents an acid test of their credentials			1
for @entity95 ' side , it will be a @entity4 in the workhouse , with visits to @entity34 and @entity11 before @entity112 strikes on @entity113 , in a three - day double - header that will reveal much about the durability of the @entity117 challenge			1
there is no shortage of @entity4 crackers to come , as @entity11 , whose form remains unconvincing , pockmarked by sloppy defending and a misfiring forward line will also come under pressure , facing @entity3 , @entity10 and a visit to @entity126			1
at some point , the threat from @entity128 must be taken more seriously			0
the challenge for @entity65 will be keeping their first - team fresh and ready to shine but @entity132 has four pretty negotiable fixtures upcoming - @entity134 , @entity102 , @entity126 and @entity135			2
the statistics read less favourably for @entity29 , who will be placed no higher than sixth on christmas day , and possibly below , should @entity25 or @entity31 win their respective matches			0
what they 're playing for : sir @entity141 lifts the @entity8 trophy last may leading light : @entity3 are top of the @entity8 but have stuttered recently and were thumped 6 - 3 at @entity28 - @entity144 here scoring the second past @entity3 keeper @entity145 @entity29 , may , however sense an opportunity to cut down that 10 point gap			1
as their rivals face off in quick succession , @entity13 resembles a season of goodwill for the champions with @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity28 next on the agenda			0
only once before has a team languishing in sixth on christmas day gone on to lift the @entity8 title - @entity3 's 1998 side , which went 21 games unbeaten , winning 18 of those after a poor first half of the season			1
you would imagine that @entity163 now requires a similarly improbable run of stunning consistency to hand @entity29 any chance whatsoever of retaining their crown			0
standing out from the crowd : @entity171 fans celebrate survival in 2005 when they became the only side bottom at @entity4 to avoid the drop @entity175 moment : @entity178 boss @entity177 celebrates completing mission impossible			1
@entity102 of 2013/14 will be hoping to emulate @entity171 's feat never before has a team positioned below sixth on @entity4 recovered to win the @entity8 title			1
if you think @entity29 's chances are slim , spare a thought for poor old @entity102 , who are already consigned to bottom spot this @entity4 , after recording a measly nine points so far this season and falling four points adrift of fellow strugglers @entity193 and @entity90			1
history dictates that @entity196 's side are all but finished - only one side that was bottom at @entity4 have recovered to stay up in the @entity8 era - @entity177 's @entity171 in 2005			1
it 's a good job football is n't played on paper , eh ? @entity201 finish relegated ?			0

seven of past nine title winners were top on @entity4
*kop* fans last *rejoiced* being @entity206 in 2009 only to finish runners - up
@entity11 have been top three times , @entity3 twice , over festive period
sorry @entity102 , only one side 's been bottom at @entity4 and survived
