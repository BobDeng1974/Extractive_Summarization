by @entity0 for golfers who struggle to avoid the water hazards , it could be a challenging course			0
the @entity4 has revealed plans for a radical £ 320m floating course , which players access by an undersea tunnel			1
the course is part of a massive plan to replace the sinking islands with a network of man made , floating islands			1
with an average elevation of just five feet above sea level the @entity4 , with its 1,192 islands in the @entity19 , is the lowest country in the world			1
the floating golf course that could soon form the centerpiece of the @entity4 , replacing its islands as they sink below the surface of the sea amid fears many of the islands will soon sink into the sea , the @entity4 government has started a joint venture with the architectural firm @entity33 to build the world ’s largest series of artificial floating - islands			1
the @entity38 firm has already built floating islands for prisons and housing from slabs of concrete and polystyrene foam			1
the hotel and conference centre , which resemble a starfish from above , will be built within circular reefs to allow visitors to dive right from the beach in the @entity4 , the floating islands will be anchored to the seabed using cables or telescopic mooring piles , making landforms that are stable even in storms			1
the architects chose this approach to minimise damage to the seabed , and also chose to build lots of small islands to reduce the shadow on the seabed , which could affect wildlife			2
the islands will be constructed in @entity67 or the @entity68 to reduce costs , then simply towed to their final destination in the @entity4			1
the real thing : the @entity73 resort in @entity4 , which researchers say could soon be under water , along with the rest of the @entity4			2
the islands will also be designed for swimmers , divers and even private submarines to enter them from below , and the @entity38 firm designing the scheme has said visitors will be able to rent private submarines that can surface right in the middle of their living rooms			2
watch out for the water hazards : the plans include an 18 hole golf course designed by @entity90 , complete with clubhouse the idea is the brainchild of @entity38 firm @entity94 who designed the project			2
it is being engineered by floating architecture specialists @entity99			0
ceo @entity100 said : ' we told the president of the @entity4 we can transform you from climate refugees to climate innovators			2
' and we have a way of building and sustaining this project that is environmentally friendly too			0
' this is going to be an exclusively green development in a marine - protected area			0
' the first part of the project to be built will be the golf course			2
' this will be the first and only floating golf course in the world - and it comes complete with spectacular ocean views on every hole , ' said @entity100			2
' and then there 's the clubhouse			0
' you get in an elevator and go underwater to get to it			0
' it 's like being @entity127 down there			0
' players will access the floating course via a series of underwater tunnels so wide they can even accommodate a golf buggy designer @entity134 said : ' we 'll be building the islands somewhere else , probably in the @entity68 or in @entity67 - that way there 's no environmental cost to the @entity4			1
' when it comes to the golf course , the islands will be floated into position first and then the grass will be seeded and the trees planted afterwards			0
' development on the course is expected to begin later this year , and it should be ready for play by the end of 2013 ahead of the full launch in 2015			0
the course will be split over different floating islands , while private cabins will also be located on some of the islands the proposed site is just a five - minute speedboat ride from the capital of @entity158 , giving golfers the chance to make quick journeys to the mainland			1
amazingly , the course will even be powered by solar energy which is a resource the @entity4 has plenty of - as it 's located just north of the equator			0
the designers claim the entire resort will be carbon neutral			0
43 private floating islands will be built , complete with a jetty to moor your yacht and a pool			1
the ambitious plans will also feature 43 private islands			1
called @entity178 ( the @entity4 word for @entity180 )			0
this unique project exists of 43 floating private @entity182 in a archipelago configuration			1
each has its own jetty for yachts , along with a pool			0
palm trees give each mini island its own secluded area			0
even the low cost ' affordable ' housing has a luxury feel , complete with waterside jettys			0
the ' workers islands ' will be in their own area of the @entity4 , allowing workers to commute by boat to other areas the sea views of the @entity4 most popular resorts are set to be kept - but on a floating island instead of a real one @entity204 near @entity4			1
researchers say it could soon be under water , so plans for a series of floating islands are being drawn up .			1

floating islands will be moored to the seabed using cables to minimise environmental impact
golf course will be accessed by a tunnel on the seabed , and have an underwater clubhouse for golfers to relax in after their game
43 private islands complete with their own beaches and yacht moorings
@entity182 will be be built in @entity67 or the @entity68 and towed to the @entity4
