her very name encapsulated the stick - thin fashion ideals of the @entity3			1
now , at 64 , @entity4 is no longer the willowy size six waif who ‘ ate like a horse ’ and never gained weight – but instead a more shapely eight - and - a - half stone size ten			1
and she even admits occasionally dieting and wearing support knickers under tight dresses although she still looks fabulous , the news that even international supermodels are not immune to filling out will be music to the ears of the vast majority of women who do n’t have catwalk figures			2
but it is also the secret weapon that @entity22 hopes can turn round their flagging fortunes on the high street			1
' the monochrome trend is big for summer and ideal for a grown - up @entity26 like me ! try it for the office or a smart garden party ' : @entity31 , £ 49.50			1
@entity32 , £ 49.50 ' this sixties inspired swing dress is perfect for @entity36 weddings ... and certainly sparks fond memories for me ' : swing shift dress , £ 59 , @entity40 , £ 45 when the @entity3 style icon came out of modelling retirement a decade ago in an acclaimed advertising campaign for @entity22 , there was an instant ‘ @entity50 ’ – and the clothes she wore walked off the shelves , helping to boost the share price to its highest point in eight years			1
now her own online - only fashion collection is proving a bestseller for the store – a rare bright spot for the company which last week reported a dip in profits for the third year running , a problem exacerbated by a general slump in fashion sales			1
the secret of her success is that the effects of time have given @entity4 a heightened appreciation of the fashion needs of ordinary women – which can be seen in the designs of her new summer collection , available online today			1
in an exclusive preview for @entity75 , she reveals how she is determined to design for women who never knew what it was to be a ‘ twiglet ’			1
indeed , her new @entity22 collection goes from a size eight to a size 22			1
‘ i think that ’s only right , ’ she says			2
‘ there are big people out there and they have to be able to buy clothes			1
' a real shape shifter ... this is amazing for creating hour - glass curves , even on a twiglet ! ' : sleeveless shift dress , £ 59 , @entity92 , £ 49.50 ' this hot fuchsia dress with pretty lace sleeves will make you look a stunner from daytime until midnight at a summer wedding , and its secret weapon is its secret slimming panel ' : lace dress , £ 59 , @entity102 , £ 45 ' you ¿ ll love the way this skirt swishes , it feels so free , and my gorgeous silky t - shirts genuinely go with everything - dress them up or down ' : @entity110 £ 19.50 , @entity111 , £ 45 , @entity92 , £ 49.50 , @entity112 , £ 35 ' i rely on @entity113 as much as the next woman , and mine is a must - have with its flattering vertical pleat ' : @entity117 , £ 59 , @entity118 , £ 29.50 , @entity102 , £ 45 ‘ i do think that if you ’re that size you should look at your diet but these people still have to buy clothes and should n’t be left out			1
‘ also , it ’s @entity22 ’ policy to do that size			1
it ’s not fair when you go into a shop and the sizes only go up to a @entity130 14			2
’ while the rest of the high street is littered with sleeveless frocks that require the toned biceps of @entity135 , @entity4 has made sure nearly all of her designs have sleeves			1
much more flattering for ms average			1
her fuchsia number with long , lace sleeves will be particularly popular for summer weddings			0
moreover her range of sensibly hued t - shirts have sleeves that come nearly down to the elbow – a neat solution for those of us afflicted by bingo - wings			1
@entity4 admits that in years gone by @entity22 ’s women ’s offering was ‘ a bit mummish ’ but insists it is now ‘ brilliant ’ and ‘ so good for the price ’			1
she wo n’t reveal her own sales figures but says the line continues to do very well , ‘ touch wood ’			0
‘ we did a blue suede biker jacket for spring which sold out within two days			0
@entity160 did we know we could have ordered ten times the amount , ’ she says			0
‘ we ’ve had a sequined jacket that has been in most of the collections in different colours			0
you can wear it at any age			1
i never put an age on my clothes and always say the range is from 18 to 80			1
’ when we meet , her still - fabulous legs are encased in her own @entity172 black jeggings – a cross between leggings and jeans			1
but instead of the on - trend low - cut style , they are cut over the waist , which serves to keep her ever - so - slight muffin top expertly hidden			2
‘ they ’re not bloody hipsters so they do n’t dig in , ’ @entity4 admits candidly			1
‘ even when i was skinny , i hated hipsters : they cut into my hip bone and were really painful			0
i want clothes that help , that are easy , not precious			2
’ her autumn collection will also feature the same very tight , very hot pink dress that she wore to her 35 - year - old daughter @entity188 ’s wedding last year			1
she confirms with a laugh that she went on the ‘ fabulous ’ 5.2 diet – in which you eat normally for five days and then for two days restrict yourself to 500 calories – in order to look her best in it - the dress also has a secret support lining which really helped ! ' i might have been known for the miniskirt , but i have fallen in love with sophisticated maxis			1
mine has a hankerchief hem that keeps it youthful ' : @entity205 £ 19.50 , @entity206 £ 45 , @entity102 £ 45 ' this classic @entity208 number is brilliant for cocktails , dancing and is extremely flattering around the middle ' : @entity211 £ 59 , @entity92 , £ 49.50 ‘ the 5:2 is so doable because you eat , you do n’t starve , ’ @entity4 says			1
‘ i lost about 8lb in the end			0
’ and the support pants which many see as a garment of torture ? ‘ oh yes , i ’ve got a mixture			2
they ’re so comfortable actually , ’ she says			2
‘ i ’ve had to wear old fashioned corsets for period dramas before			0
they ’re really good for your diet because if you eat a big meal and then have to get into a corset it ’s agony			2
’ her admission that she now has to watch her figure carefully is a far cry from the accusations of promoting anorexia she endured when she was first discovered at 16 in 1966			0
‘ i did look different , like an alien being and was ever so thin , but i made it very clear that i was n’t anorexic and that i ate and ate and nothing happened , ’ she says			0
‘ of course that changes when you get older			0
i ’m much more careful about what i eat now			0
but i ’m lucky because i like healthy food			0
‘ potatoes and bread are my downfall , though			0
i ca n’t give up really good bread			0
you know that crusty bread they bring you in restaurants ? oh			0
they always bring it when you ’re waiting for your food and you ’re starving so you fill your face with it			0
’ but @entity4 is also shocked by how much larger people are today			1
‘ the average size now is @entity130 14/16 whereas when i was younger it was 12/14 , ’ she says seriously			1
‘ you want to go to @entity254			0
i ’ve never seen such big bottoms in my life			0
it ’s terrifying , ’ she says			0
‘ i find it upsetting because those people are probably not going to make it , yet they still walk along eating cream cakes and doughnuts and ice creams and drinking huge buckets of @entity265			0
‘ and what happens in @entity267 usually happens here too			0
the rise in obesity is really sad			0
there are so many fast food places that are cheap and easy			0
‘ when i was growing up in the 1950s we were n’t rich by any stretch of the imagination , but mum used to go to the shops every second day and buy fresh produce from the greengrocers and we ate what was in season			2
of course , occasionally we all eat something rubbish , but i do try not to			0
’ when it comes to design , she is much more strict			2
‘ i am a perfectionist about it and am also very bossy , but we laugh a lot			0
‘ after the first fitting we laughed or occasionally screamed and have thrown an item out - we then tweaked and pinned until the quality and fabric is perfect			2
' ‘ it ’s serious stuff , but fashion should be fun			2
i ’ve got to an age where if something does n’t have a fun element i do n’t see the point in doing it			2
’ it ’s easy to see why @entity22 are redeploying their most effective weapon			1
but can the @entity50 again revive the company ’s fortunes ?			0
