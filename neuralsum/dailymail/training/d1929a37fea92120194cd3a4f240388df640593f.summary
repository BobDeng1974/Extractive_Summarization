by @entity0 @entity1 has implemented a strict regime of discipline on his @entity5 players in a bid to mentally toughen them for the new season			1
the squad were subjected to a talk from their head coach at the beginning of the season , in which he outlined his new stick over carrot approach , and reportedly told them , ' from now on , this is all completely compulsory '			0
at the centre of the new idea is a rigorous system of fines for small indiscretions , which the @entity24 press have christened ' @entity1 's punishment catalogue '			1
punishable indiscretions involve arriving late to team meetings , not observing dress codes , failing to put dirty clothes in laundry bins , and taking phone calls on the first floor of @entity5 's training ground hq on @entity34			1
serious business : @entity5 boss @entity1 is getting strict on his players this season physical : @entity1 puts his hands on forward @entity39 during an open training session intense : @entity1 shouts during training as he aims to get his @entity5 squad back to their best players will receive a € 250 fine for committing an offence on one occasion , with the size of the fine going up by another € 250 with every repeat offence			1
captain @entity50 is said to be in charge of collecting the fines from offending players			1
fines will also be handed out to players who are deemed to be overweight , and to those who fail to eat within an hour of the end of a training session or a match			0
this last point is reported to be particularly important to @entity1			1
on the advice of @entity5 's dietician @entity62 , the players should be eating pasta dishes within an hour of finishing work , but many avoid doing so , in order to eat with their families when they return home			1
this has clearly begun to frustrate the @entity1			2
the stricter discipline has been taken as a direct response to @entity5 's @entity72 collapse last season			2
in april , director of sport @entity75 complained that the atmosphere at the club was too friendly , describing it as a ' cuddly oasis '			0
his worst fears were confirmed when the team slumped to a 4 - 0 humiliation at the hands of @entity85 days late			0
having already won the @entity87 by march , many saw that defeat as a psychological failure			2
debt collector : captain @entity50 is said to be the man in charge of taking fines from players pass and move : @entity5 ( and @entity95 , left ) are expected to win the @entity87 again this season indeed , @entity1 admitted as much himself			1
in a new biography dealing with his first year at @entity5 , the @entity96 is quoted saying that he and his players became too emotional about the @entity85 game , which ultimately led to their downfall			1
hence the new , more ruthless approach			0
with a plethora of early season injuries to deal with , as well a lack of pre-season preparation for his @entity108 winners , @entity1 is also keen to make sure the side is as fit as possible			2
@entity50 explained the new regime in those terms			2
' we 're not used to starting the season having trained so little			0
after such a short holiday , it 's difficult to be at 100 per cent ' said the @entity5 captain			0
despite having won the @entity117 in his first season in @entity119 , @entity1 knows that his time at @entity5 will be judged primarily on the @entity72			1
he is desperate to avoid the same physical and psychological collapse which embarrassed his team last season			0
as the new season gets under way , it 's out with the cuddly oasis , and in with the @entity129 bootcamp			0
@entity5 not expecting to stroll past slumping @entity130			0

@entity95 , @entity50 and @entity39 have to abide by rules
@entity1 admits that his passion can boil over in management
@entity5 are expected to *clinch* the @entity87 title again this year
