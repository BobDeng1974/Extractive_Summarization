by @entity1 reporter the @entity3 poinsettia could be in short supply this @entity5 because growers have been hit by soaring energy costs and competition from cheaper , inferior foreign plants			1
for millions of families , the distinctive plant – @entity3 ’s second most popular pot plant after the orchid – is a festive staple			1
but delicate poinsettias need carefully controlled temperatures of between @entity17 ( @entity18 ) and @entity19 ( 68f ) and rocketing fuel bills have driven some @entity3 growers out of business			1
@entity5 favourites : for millions of families , the distinctive plant - @entity3 ¿ s second most popular pot plant after the orchid - is a festive staple			1
but many @entity3 growers have pulled out of producing the delicate crop they are now producing around a million fewer than five years ago and shoppers are increasingly having to buy imports from @entity33			1
many @entity35 nurseries are backed by subsidies to help install energy - efficient heating			2
horticultural experts say @entity35 poinsettias have weaker stems , fewer branches and are less hardy			1
@entity3 growers devote 18 to 20 weeks to cultivating the plant while the @entity35 spend only 12 to 15 - and transporting it by lorry from @entity33 takes its toll too			1
@entity44 , of @entity45 , @entity46 , had been growing 200,000 poinsettias a year for @entity48 ’s and @entity49			2
but bosses have decided to stop after the energy bill to grow its plants last year was more than £ 50,000			0
@entity44 managing director @entity53 said that they are now growing cyclamen instead			2
' energy use for poinsettia is very intensive for a number of months , ' he said			0
' heating costs were £ 50,000 - plus - a big investment - because they ’re a tropical plant and you have to have them at @entity19 to make them feel comfy			0
' @entity65 turned out to be a risky crop			0
it is highly unlikely we will revisit that crop as the cyclamen programme we replaced it with is more profitable			0
' with cyclamen , we ’re not looking at huge gas bill			0
' we ’re sorry because so many customers want to buy @entity3 poinsettias but we have made the right decision for our business			1
' thing of the past : the poinsettia @entity5 crop at @entity82 nurseries last year			0
the firm has now decided to pull out of growing the plants after rising energy costs made it too difficult to make a profit @entity88 , chairman of the @entity89 , a trade body for @entity3 growers , said that poinsettia production among members has slumped			1
temperamental poinsettias need specific conditions – but treat yours well and it could bloom again next @entity5			2
he said : ' poinsettias have become one of those things on the @entity5 shopping list that people expect like turkey and a christmas tree			2
' but there will be fewer @entity3 poinsettias available this year and garden centres and supermarkets can always go to @entity33			1
' we are talking about diminishing choice and people may end up buying @entity35 and @entity114 poinsettias			1
' poinsettias are a heat hungry crop			2
you can not compromise on the temperature if you are going to grow a quality crop			0
' and if growers see that last year ’s fuel bill was high , that is what they base their decision on			0
' a lot of growers have switched to cyclamen			0
' mr @entity88 said that @entity3 growers lavish much more attention on their crops than their @entity35 counterparts			1
' the @entity3 start growing earlier in june or july and have a lower density of crop - around nine plants per square metre compared to 15 in @entity33 , ' he said			1
' it means that they have more branches than @entity35 poinsettias , which are more upright			1
' and any @entity3 grower will tell you that theirs is a better plant because it spends less time in a lorry and is less tightly packed in boxes than the @entity35 , who are mindful of their transport costs			1
' it is a very similar tale of woe nationwide for @entity3 poinsettia growers			2
@entity151 , of @entity152 , @entity153 , has halved production this year from 50,000 to 25,000 after poring over fuel bills			0
@entity156 , near @entity157 , used to be one of the country ’s biggest growers that supplied 500,000 poinsettias to @entity48 ’s and @entity162			2
but it gave up production in 2011 with director @entity165 citing ' spiralling energy costs '			0
@entity167 , near @entity168 , @entity153 , also grew the plant for many years but stopped because it was no longer viable			0
poinsettias originate from @entity171 and were once tall , fragile and mostly seen only in the houses of the wealthy			0
but hardier dwarf strains appeared in the @entity174 and their popularity has soared since the @entity176			0
they are also a festive favourite in the @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 but @entity182 like cream , purple and oranges as well as red .			0

@entity3 firms now growing around a million fewer poinsettias than five years ago
but @entity35 imports have weaker stems , fewer branches and are less hardy
