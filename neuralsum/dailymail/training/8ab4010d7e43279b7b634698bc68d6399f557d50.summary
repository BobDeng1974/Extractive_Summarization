a pair of sisters are celebrating after both giving birth to baby girls just hours apart in the same hospital			2
inseparable siblings @entity5 and @entity6 were delighted when they became pregnant at around the same time			2
and the pair joked that the â€˜ race was on ' - but were stunned when they both went into labour on the same day			1
eldest sister @entity5 , 27 , from @entity26 , gave birth to @entity15 , weighing in at 7lbs 1oz , at 1.58am last tuesday			1
then new mother @entity6 , 19 , from @entity28 , followed suit with baby @entity18 , weighing 5lbs 10oz , at 7.14pm			1
@entity5 , who was already a mother - of - two , beamed : ' we were both in a slow labour that lasted two days and we joked that the race was on to have our babies			1
' we said we might end up in a birthing pool together but did n't imagine that we really would give birth on the same day			0
' i ended up four days overdue and @entity6 was five days early so we met in the middle			0
' @entity15 and @entity18 were delivered just hours apart at @entity25 hospital and the sisters have definitely beat the odds , as bookmakers @entity43 put the odds of two sisters giving birth on the same day at 2,000 - 1			1
they both found out that they were expecting girls at a scan early in their pregnancies and both went into labour on sunday , august 24			0
@entity5 , who also has two sons @entity53 , seven , and five - year - old @entity54 , was admitted to hospital last monday and gave birth in the early hours of tuesday			2
@entity6 was admitted later on on tuesday and gave birth on the same day			0
the sisters ' paths did n't cross in hospital because @entity5 had been discharged by the time @entity6 gave birth			1
but mother @entity62 , now a proud grandmother of 10 , kept them informed via text message			0
@entity5 added : ' my mum joked that she wished she had put a bet on us having a baby the same day now			2
' we are close and when we found out we were both pregnant we went for all our scans @entity71 both gave birth naturally using gas and air			0
' @entity6 said : ' it helped my sister being pregnant at the same time because we could support each other			0
' and it 's special that our daughters will grow up together and will the share the same birthday			0
' @entity5 went to hospital last monday and @entity6 the following day after both going into labour on sunday			1

@entity5 , 27 , from @entity26 , and @entity6 , 19 , from @entity28 , joked ' race was on '
