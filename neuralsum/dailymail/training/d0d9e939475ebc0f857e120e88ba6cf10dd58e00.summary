@entity1 manager @entity0 remains confident his side can reach boiling point over the next 10 games and force their way back into the @entity7 title race			1
the @entity9 head to @entity10 on saturday in seventh place after five draws have left them eleven points behind leaders @entity14 , who are away to @entity15 on sunday			1
only a dramatic late recovery , with two goals in the final two minutes , secured victory in the @entity19 at @entity20 on wednesday night			1
@entity0 talks to @entity21 in friday 's training session ahead of the trip to @entity10 the @entity25 manager believes his side will hit top form in the coming weeks after a slow start to the season @entity0 accepts his side need to add an efficiency to their game at both ends of the pitch , but feels it will all come together over the next few weeks			1
' the main thing is there , the attitude and the quality , but water boils at @entity40 and not at 99 , so we have to add that degree , ' said @entity0			2
' i look at how we can be more efficient , that is my only worry			0
only a late equaliser from @entity46 salvaged a point against @entity48 in the @entity9 ' last @entity7 game ' we dominate our games			1
it is just that when we have a weaker moment we pay for it , which is why we have to produce more effort defensively as a team			0
' if we are more efficient in 10 games time then we will be in a much better position , so let 's start on saturday ( at @entity10 )			1
' goalkeeper @entity58 is set to return having served a one - match @entity60 ban in midweek			0
@entity0 feels the 24 - year - old has continued his improvement but warns the @entity64 faces a ' big fight ' to stay number one ahead of @entity68 @entity67 , who is currently sidelined by injury , and @entity70 , the 22 - year - old @entity71 who did not look out of place when standing in against @entity20			1
the @entity9 were poor against @entity20 but won the game with a 90th minute winner from @entity75 ' one of the problems he had recently ( was coming out of his goal ) , but i do n't think it is a deep problem , ' @entity0 said of @entity58			1
' i want him to come out , i encourage him to come out , but overall he is doing well and is improving always			0
' @entity80 is ( an ) important ( player ) , but he is in a big fight with @entity67 and @entity70 , i think that will keep him on his toes			0
' at the moment i think he is doing alright , but he is in a big fight			0
' @entity1 will be looking to put a few more goals past their former keeper @entity88 , who shipped eight at @entity90 last weekend			2
the @entity91 , who left last summer , wants the @entity10 players to repay the ticket and travel expenses of their 2,500 fans who made the 653 - mile round trip from @entity98			2
it is a gesture which comes as no surprise to @entity0			2
@entity58 ( left ) will likely return against @entity10 at the expense of @entity70 ( right ) ' @entity88 is from a normal background like we all are			0
his gesture was spontaneous and not calculated because it was quite an expensive one , so i think he shows that he cares , ' said the @entity1 manager			0
' he did well ( here ) , but was in the position of @entity70 , a number three			0
' @entity88 had the quality , but did n't play the games and after a certain age you have to let them go			0
' so he went to @entity10 , where he was not first choice at the start , but he gained his place and i was not surprised because he is quick , confident and overall he has done extremely well there			1

@entity1 are seventh in the @entity7 , eleven points behind @entity14
the @entity9 face @entity10 on saturday in a *3pm* kick - off
@entity0 is confident @entity1 can hit top form after slow start
his team were *fortunate* in beating @entity20 2 - 1 on wednesday
