by @entity0 @entity1 has waded into the controversial and ethically murky @entity3 civil war - issuing a call to her 20 million followers on @entity6 to save the ancient @entity9 @entity8 village of @entity10 , which was taken over by rebels last month			1
however , despite her well - intentioned tweet , the reality television star has been criticized for using the hashtag # @entity15 - which some have accused of being part of a stealth social media campaign backing @entity3 dictator @entity19			1
the hashtag has been linked with false claims made by loyalists to @entity19 , who have said that @entity3 rebels desecrated the village 's churches and slaughtered its residents			1
political statement : @entity1 has tweeted her support for the embattled @entity29 in @entity3 - causing some controversy indeed , horrifying images linked to @entity32 that show a young girl mutilated with a crucifix and a decapitated little girl have been comprehensively debunked - with critics branding them @entity38 propaganda			1
' if you do n't know what 's going on in @entity10 please google it ... as an @entity9 , i grew up hearing so many painful stories , ' @entity1 wrote in a march 30 tweet			2
' please let 's not let history repeat itself ! ! ! ! ! ! let 's get this trending ! ! ! ! # @entity50 # @entity49 , ' she wrote			0
in doing so , @entity1 , whose father was of @entity9 descent , underscored how @entity3 's war , more than any other in history , has been waged on social media , with both supporters of president @entity19 and those opposing his rule using selectively chosen videos and photos , sometimes faked , recycled or altered , to support their grievances			1
concern : @entity1 tweeted this on sunday march 30 - as she sought to draw attention to the danger facing @entity29 in @entity10 and the horror of the genocide inflicted on her compatriots in the early part of the 20th century history : @entity1 has waded into @entity3 's conflict , calling on fans through @entity6 to save the ancient @entity9 @entity8 village of @entity76 , whose residents fled as rebels seized control of the hamlet in late march plea : @entity1 's publicist @entity81 said @entity1 was " just voicing her support for @entity29 " and said she had no additional comment however , it is obvious that @entity1 's support for the campaign to save civilians caught up in the brutal fighting in @entity10 is far more personal than simple altruism			1
@entity1 is @entity9 and april is the month during which her compatriots remember the genocide of an estimate 1.5 million @entity29 by @entity95 forces during @entity96 and its aftermath			1
the event is widely viewed by scholars as the first genocide of the 20th century			0
the @entity1 family are originally from @entity102 , a village in @entity104 , close to the @entity9 border and populated by ethnic @entity29			2
her great - great grandparents on her father 's side are @entity109 and @entity110 - the @entity112 spelling of the @entity9 name , @entity1			2
they fled along with her great - grandfather during the ' @entity115 ' or @entity115 - which was the genocide and expulsion of @entity29 from what is now modern - day @entity104			0
the family made it @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity1 's father , was a high - profile lawyer who helped @entity124 's not - guilty verdict in the 1990s			2
' i was raised with a huge @entity9 influence , always hearing stories of @entity128 , celebrating @entity9 holidays , ' said @entity1 in the past			0
' my father taught us to never forget where we came from			0
' father and daughter : @entity1 and her father @entity136 , whose family are @entity9 by descent and who famously helped defend @entity124 against murder charges in the 1990s @entity1 's use of the two hashtags side - by - side , ' # @entity15 ' and ' @entity143 ' suggested she was linking the flight of most of @entity146 's 2,000 residents and those killed by @entity149 forces			1
@entity1 's tweets are not the first time she has been criticized for political errors			0
in april 2011 , she featured on the cover of @entity154 - which was controversial when considering the relationship between @entity128 and @entity104			0
@entity1 was prompted into her tweet by events last week when @entity3 rebels moved into the northwestern coastal province of @entity160 , which is where the @entity19 family is from			2
the rebels allegedly include fighters from @entity163 - the @entity3 arm of @entity165			0
critical : @entity1 has come under pressure to distance herself from # @entity15 hashtag which some say supports @entity3 dictator @entity19 anger : some took to @entity6 to chastise @entity1 for trying to tweet support for civilians in @entity10 correction : others tried to not so subtly point out that the images linked to # @entity15 are fake since then , hundreds of @entity9 @entity178 have fled and @entity10 has been overrun by rebels			1
the complicated political situation in @entity3 's three - year civil war sees the nation 's ethnic @entity9 population having to back the @entity19 regime			1
they see him as their only safety net against radical islamists who are a large part of @entity3 's opposition			2
however , this has not carried much favor with the very influential @entity9 diaspora , especially in the @entity194 - of which the @entity1 family are prominent members			0
@entity1 's public backing for @entity32 has been endorsed by the @entity198 , one of the main opposition groups			0
' we are glad @entity1 is taking an interest in this issue , as we too are concerned about extremist groupsâ € ™ persecution of minorities , ' @entity205 , a spokesman for the @entity198 , told @entity208			0
battle : @entity3 army 's artillery seen firing at rebel positions from the town of @entity214 , some four km from the rebel - held @entity76 town in the northern countryside of the coastal city of @entity160 , on 27 march 2014 fight : @entity3 soldiers seen in a position in @entity222 town , some four km from the rebel - held @entity76 town in the northern countryside of the coastal city of @entity160 , @entity3 , on 27 march 2014 ' the @entity224 has put out a statement committed to protecting of citizens of @entity9 descent and to maintaining the integrity of their religious sites and protecting them from the @entity19 's attacks and use of indiscriminate fire , which continue against innocent people			1
' however , some are plain furious with @entity1 for using drawing attention to such a controversial issue to her 20 million followers			1
@entity1 's publicist @entity81 said @entity1 was ' just voicing her support for @entity29 ' and said she had no additional comment			2
her @entity10 tweets were followed by a flurry of sultry selfies of her riding on a boat in a skimpy top and long skirt with hashtags like # @entity250 and # @entity251			0
she has been posting from @entity252 in recent days , including one that shows her sitting at the entry of a temple featuring the @entity257 .			0

@entity1 has issued a plea to protect the @entity8 's of @entity3 town kessab
tweeted # @entity15 to her 20 million followers on sunday
supporters of @entity3 's dictator @entity19 have been accused of using the hashtag
brutal images of women horribly murdered have been linked to the hashtag
these pictures have all been proved to be false and part of @entity38 propaganda
@entity1 is of @entity9 descent through her father @entity120
april is the month when her compatriots remember the genocide of 1.5 million @entity29 by @entity149 forces during @entity96
the @entity3 opposition - which contains @entity282 loyal to @entity165 - have thanked @entity1 for her support
