a size 24 woman who spent years gorging on discounted snacks on the supermarket she works at has lost seven stone after ditching the habit			0
@entity6 , 23 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , reached almost 20 stone after repeatedly taking home end - of - the - line discounted junk food			1
the supermarket worker would snack on bumper bars of chocolate , baked goods and fizzy drinks going cheap because of their sell - by dates			2
@entity6 ballooned to almost 20st after snacking on leftover goods at her place of work , but after ditching the snacks @entity6 has lost 7st and now weighs in at 13st it was n't until she broke down in a shop changing room when she could n't squeeze into their largest dress that she finally resolved to lose weight and cut out her unhealthy post-work snacks			1
following her strict diet and fitness regime @entity6 has shed seven stone and has shrunk down to 13 stone			1
@entity6 says that she had always struggled with her weight but the real problem began after starting her job in the @entity37 op. @entity6 worked as a check out girl at the co-op and would snack on discounted products every day @entity6 says that she had always struggled with her weight and was teased when she was in school @entity6 says her break through moment came when she was unable to fit into the largest size in a store ' even as a child , i was the biggest one among my friends but my weight really became a problem when i started my supermarket job and could n't resist the discounted treats , ' she said			1
' i would get teased at high school but i put on such a confident front , laughing off the hurtful comments and plastering myself in makeup just to make myself feel better			0
' by the age of 16 , @entity6 was already a size 20 and felt too embarrassed to go out with her friends so she swapped nights out with staying in wearing sweat pants and drinking fizzy drinks			1
@entity6 started her job as a team leader at co-op in 2010 , aged 19 , and she began piling on the pounds			1
by december 2013 , she weighed 19st 3lb and went shopping for a new dress but broke down in tears when she could n't fit into the store 's size 24			2
@entity6 said : ' when i started working at co-op , i found out that lots of food was discounted at the end of the shift			1
@entity6 joined @entity77 and took up walking in a bid to shed the weight ' i could n't resist the temptation			1
i would tell myself that i was bringing it home so that the food would n't be wasted or would share it between my family but to be honest i would bring home food anyway whether it was cheap or not and it would all be for me			2
' aware that she was gaining weight @entity6 attempted some weight - loss regimes but she would quickly give up			1
' as my weight increased , i did try some diets but i just could n't stick with any of them			0
i 'd get hungry at work and then could n't resist the delicious snacks that were on offer			0
' my weight soared but i ignored it until i could n't any longer - and could n't even fit into a size 24			0
@entity6 , now a size 14 , plans to drop a further dress size by the summer			1
pictured here in her old work uniform ' it was the dress incident where something finally clicked in my head			1
instead of coming home with a beautiful brand new dress i had to order a frumpy one online from a plus - sized store - i was mortified			1
' it was this light - bulb moment that finally saw @entity6 make a dramatic change to her lifestyle			1
' a week later i signed up to my local @entity77			2
i immediately cut out bread and sugar and focused on walking			0
within six months i got into the swing of it and would walk every day - and managed to lose four stone			0
' instead of stocking up on cakes , chocolate and crisps , i opted for fruit , veg and other healthy snacks instead			0
and i 've never felt better			0
' @entity6 says that one of her proudest moments came when she visited a department store and was able to try on clothes			2
@entity6 credits her boyfriend @entity127 ( pictured with her before weight loss ) for keeping her motivated ' i went to @entity129 in april and managed to fit into a pair of size 18 trousers			2
this time i cried tears of happiness - it was a long way from the last time i was in a high street changing room			0
' @entity6 says that ditching her habit for after work snacks had been tricky but she had found something else to take home instead			1
' the hardest thing has been stopping myself taking treats home from work , but i persevered and now take home fruit or vegetables			2
' now @entity6 is down to a size 14 and regularly visits the gym , running every night and visiting four times a week			1
she credits her boyfriend of four years @entity153 for keeping her motivated throughout her weight loss and aims to lose another stone to reach her goal of being a size 12 by the summer			0
' in december 2014 , i wore a size 14 dress which was a dream come true , ' said @entity6			1
' it made all the hard work worthwhile			0
the past year had been the hardest of my life , forcing myself to resist temptations , but now i can finally have bread and chocolate although in moderation			0
' @entity6 added : ' i never thought i would be able to do it			2
all it takes is a heck of a lot of willpower and dedication			0
i 've kept an old dress and pair of trousers to remind me of how big i once was			0
i can fit both of my legs in one leg of my old trousers now ! ' i have never felt so good and for once i can look in the mirror and feel happy at what i see - no more discounted goods for me			0
