the tequila sure looks real , so do the beer taps			2
inside the hospital at the @entity4 , researchers are testing a possible new treatment to help heavy drinkers cut back - using a replica of a fully stocked bar			1
the idea : sitting in the dimly lit bar - laboratory should cue the volunteers ' brains to crave a drink , and help determine if an experimental pill counters that urge			1
true , there 's no skunky bar odor ; these bottles are filled with colored water			1
the real alcohol is locked in the hospital pharmacy , ready to send over for the extra temptation of smell - and to test how safe the drug is if people drink anyway			1
dr. @entity25 , director of the @entity26 , left , and @entity26 scientist dr. @entity27 pose in a research laboratory designed as a bar inside the @entity4 of @entity31 hospital in @entity32 , @entity33 ' the goal is to create almost a real - world environment , but to control it very strictly , ' said lead researcher dr. @entity27 , who is testing how a hormone named ghrelin that sparks people 's appetite for food also affects their desire for alcohol , and if blocking it helps			1
amid all the yearly resolutions to quit , alcohol use disorders affect about 17 million @entity46 , and only a small fraction receives treatment			2
there 's no one - size - fits - all therapy , and the @entity4 is spurring a hunt for new medications that target the brain 's addiction cycle in different ways - and to find out which options work best in which drinkers			2
' @entity59 come in many forms , ' explained dr. @entity25 , director of @entity4 's @entity62 and @entity63 , which has published new online guides , explaining who 's at risk and what can help			1
what 's the limit ? @entity26 says ' low - risk ' drinking means no more than four drinks in any single day and no more than 14 in a week for men , and no more than three drinks a day and seven a week for women			0
genes play a role in who 's vulnerable to crossing the line into alcohol abuse			0
so do environmental factors , such as getting used to drinking a certain amount , not to mention how your own brain 's circuitry adapts			0
treatment can range from inpatient rehab and 12 - step programs to behavioral therapy and the few medications available today			0
@entity25 , who specializes in the neurobiology of alcohol , says it usually takes a combination and ultimately , ' you have to change your life			0
' yet a recent review for the @entity97 estimated that less than a third of people who need treatment get it , and of those , less than 10 percent receive medications			0
three drugs are approved by the @entity104 to treat alcohol abuse			1
one , naltrexone , blocks alcohol 's feel - good sensation by targeting receptors in the brain 's reward system - if people harbor a particular gene			0
the anti-craving pill acamprosate appears to calm stress - related brain chemicals in certain people			0
the older @entity117 works differently , triggering nausea and other aversive symptoms if people drink while taking it			1
sitting in the dimly lit bar - laboratory should cue the volunteers ' brains to crave a drink , and help determine if the experimental pill counters that urge ( file picture ) recent research suggests a handful of drugs used for other disorders also show promise : - scientists at the @entity134 found the epilepsy drug gabapentin reduced relapses in drinkers who 'd recently quit , and improved cravings , mood and sleep by targeting an emotion - related brain chemical			1
- a study by @entity26 and five medical centers found the anti-smoking drug @entity146 may help alcohol addiction , too , by reducing heavy drinkers ' cravings			0
- and @entity151 researchers found the epilepsy drug topiramate helped heavy drinkers cut back , if they have a particular gene variation mostly found in people of @entity157 descent			2
back in @entity4 's bar lab , one of about a dozen versions around the country , the focus is on ghrelin , the hormone produced in the stomach that controls appetite via receptors in the brain			2
it turns out there 's overlap between receptors that fuel overeating and alcohol craving in the brain 's reward system , explained @entity26 's @entity27			0
in a study published this fall , his team gave 45 heavy - drinking volunteers different doses of ghrelin , and their urge to drink rose along with the extra hormone			1
now @entity27 is testing whether blocking ghrelin 's action also blocks those cravings , using an experimental @entity188 drug originally developed for diabetes but never sold			2
the main goal of this first - step study is to ensure mixing alcohol with the drug is safe			0
but researchers also measure cravings as volunteers , hooked to a blood pressure monitor in the tiny bar - lab , smell a favorite drink			1
initial safety results are expected this spring			0
' our hope is that down the line , we might be able to do a simple blood test that tells if you will be a naltrexone person , an acamprosate person , a ghrelin person , ' @entity25 said .			1

researchers at the @entity62 and @entity63 hope bar will cue volunteers ' crave to drink
the environment can test whether the experimental drugs are effective
