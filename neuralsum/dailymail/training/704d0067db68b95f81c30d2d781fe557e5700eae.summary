by @entity1 reporter published : 19:30 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 20:16 est , 27 january 2014 @entity5 is ‘ frozen in aspic ’ and does not reflect the changing face of @entity7 , the show ’s new boss has claimed			1
the soap , set in @entity10 , must take into account the influence of trendy @entity13 just down the road , said executive producer @entity15 , who took over in august last year			1
he said : ‘ it should feel more like @entity7			1
it ’s been frozen in aspic for too long			2
' ' frozen ' : @entity5 , set in @entity10 , east @entity7 , has not changed with the times sufficiently , said its executive producer trendy : now hip @entity13 in east @entity7 will start ' creeping in ' to the soap			1
pictured is @entity25 , a ' pop - up ' mall made of shipping containers which is next to @entity30 station hub : @entity13 has become a big attraction for young artists and technology firms the @entity35 soap is undergoing a revamp , including the recruitment of hardman actor @entity38 as @entity40 landlord @entity39 , as part of an attempt to reinvigorate the drama following a ratings slump			1
the @entity35 recently unveiled plans to build a new @entity46 , which will replicate the original but also be 20 per cent bigger to allow the long - running soap to open up new locations to film in			1
@entity7 has taken off since @entity5 was first broadcast in 1985			1
terraced houses on @entity50 , the area of @entity10 which was used as the original inspiration for @entity46 , now fetch as much as £ 700,000			2
speaking to the @entity52 , mr @entity15 said the soap had to keep up with the world around it			1
headed to the @entity46 ? @entity13 is often the canvas for vibrant street art he said : ' @entity59 ( @entity60 ) said recently that she 's looking to be a landlady and as a result you 'll see the edges of @entity13 creeping into @entity5			1
it 's got to reflect the modern world			2
' @entity13 , a once run - down part of @entity7 , is now popular with ' hipsters ' , art students and technology companies , while even former prime minister @entity70 recently dined out there			1
mr @entity15 , who took over as executive producer in august last year following the departure of @entity73 , also said he wanted to see the soap focus less on action and more on character			1
in the past 12 months , @entity77 , which recently beat @entity5 to best soap at the @entity79 , has featured an inferno at the @entity81 while @entity82 had a siege at the @entity84			2
but @entity15 told the magazine : ' @entity5 has got to shake up the audience			1
we do n't want to do cover versions of greatest hits			2
' @entity5 has to sing new songs , otherwise it does n't feel fresh			2
and it also has to be about people and feelings and emotions			2
i 've never been a fan of blowing things up			2
' mr @entity15 said he was happy to see the return of familiar faces , including @entity98 as @entity99 , as well as new characters			1
revamp : the classic look of @entity5 , left , which first broadcast in 1985 , will mingle with the trendier environs of @entity13 , now a hub for new bars and restaurants , right ' it 's good to have one foot in the past while looking to the future			1
my idea is to make the show feel fresh with the @entity112 , but also a bit nostalgic by bringing back characters we love			0
and there should be more secrets that will make the viewer gasp			0
' you want those moments where the audience is thinking , " @entity122 , i did n't know that was going to happen			0
" that used to be what the show did brilliantly and what i really want it to do again			0
' he said that he had been a ' proper die - hard @entity5 fan ' , even before he began working on the soap			1
he told the magazine : ' i remember poring over the map of @entity46 that @entity52 published when the first episode aired			0
i grew up in @entity133 in @entity134 , which is about 10 minutes down the road from where @entity5 is filmed in @entity136 , and i 'd go along to the studio and stick my head through the gates			0
' i 'd never felt an affinity with @entity77 - it 's a fantastic show , but it was n't my thing			2
i liked @entity5 because it felt dangerous , real and naughty , and also that it was saying something about life , ' he said			0
shake - up : recent changes to @entity5 include @entity38 , left , joining the show - and scenes where his character @entity39 accepted the homosexuality of his son , @entity153 ( centre ) ' @entity155 is a heavy word , but i did once stalk @entity157 ( who played @entity158 ) around the @entity133 branch of @entity160 , ' he said			1
' she and i have laughed about it since '			0
new recruit @entity38 has played against type in the soap , with his character embracing his son @entity165 ( @entity165 ) and telling him he is proud of him for coming out as gay			1
changes : @entity15 explains the changes to the series in a @entity52 interview the actor said that it was about time @entity5 featured a good father			1
' i do n't think @entity5 usually portrays good fathers , ' @entity38 said			1
' they 're often quite dysfunctional			0
i 'm one of the first to come in and be a really good parent			0
i think that 's what was needed			0
plus they used the perception of what i 'm known for and spun it on its head			0
' it was a gamble			0
but i 've had letters from young gay men who 'd been too scared to come out , but who did so after watching that episode			0
' meanwhile , @entity77 's producer @entity188 said that he was not resting on his laurels , despite getting plaudits for the way the @entity193 soap portrayed @entity195 's death			2
' i abhor complacency , ' he said			0
' @entity195 's death was pitch perfect			0
it 's the proudest i 've ever been			0
but after it 's aired , who gives a toss ? ' we have the next 12 months to deal with and it 's got to be magnificent			0
' if we have a bad six weeks , then it can be six months before we get the audience back			0
but i 've every confidence in my stories			0

executive producer @entity15 said the soap was ' frozen '
but now it will begin to take on more modern influences
he said elements of trendy @entity13 in @entity7 will ' creep in '
part of a more *general* shake - up , which includes recruiting @entity38
