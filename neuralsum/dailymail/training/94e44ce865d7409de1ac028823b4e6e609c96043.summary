@entity0 might have set the ball rolling with their prototype self - driving car , but it does n’t exactly set the pulse racing with its looks			1
so step in @entity6 , who have unveiled a sleek and stylish vehicle that they say could be the future of autonomous cars			2
revealed in a presentation at the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) in @entity15 , the @entity12 concept boasts rotating pedestal seats , carriage style doors - and of course , self - driving capability			1

for @entity14 2015 @entity45 delivered its latest hi - tech innovation in a unique way			1
the @entity21 car maker sent its self driving car on a 550 - mile ( 885km ) journey from @entity51 to @entity15			1
the @entity21 auto - giant calls its self - driving technology ‘ @entity58 ’ , and insists the sensors and equipment demonstrated in the vehicle are ‘ production ready ’			1
as a result , the company claims it is on course to put driverless cars into commercial production as soon as next year			0
@entity6 said they wanted to focus on some of the other aspects aside from just the technology that drives it , though			0
and that led them to design a concept that might more resemble what self - driving cars of the future will look like			2
‘ anyone who focuses solely on the technology has not yet grasped how autonomous driving will change our society , ’ said mr @entity41			0
‘ the car is growing beyond its role as a mere means of transport and will ultimately become a mobile living space			0
' the luxury sedan , which seats four , measures 17ft ( 5.2 metres ) in length and 5ft ( 1.5 metres ) high			0
it is made of carbon - fibre , aluminium and high - strength steel			0
it ’s designed to be able to use an electric motor and a hydrogen fuel cell			0
using its hybrid system it can travel 685 miles ( 1,100 km ) on a single charge			0
a single pane of glass covers the top of the car , extending from its long windshield to its sunroof			0
in december 2014 @entity0 unveiled the final design for its own self - driving car ( shown ) , but it does n't exactly have much of an aesthetic appeal			1
the first version came under fire for looking like a toy car - and a new rooftop sensor means the second now looks like a toy police car @entity6 ' car , meanwhile , has space for four and uses ' swivel chairs ' that rotate 30 degrees ( shown ) so that the passengers can talk to each other easily			1
a driver can also take manual control of the car , or just let it drive them autonomously the luxury sedan , which seats four , measures 17ft ( 5.2 metres ) in length and 5ft ( 1.5 metres ) high			1

it ’s designed to be able to use an electric motor and a hydrogen fuel cell , and can travel 685 miles ( 1,100 km ) on a charge while the car is self - driving , it can project led lights on to the road ( seen at the front ) to let pedestrians know when to cross futuristic : a single pane of glass covers the top of the car , extending from its long windshield to its sunroof safety first : while the car is self - driving , it can project lights on to the road using its led headlights to let pedestrians know when to cross there are six high - resolution touch - screens on the doors , which passengers can use to control the car 's features or even see outside the @entity12 has large 26 - inch wheels which are placed right in the corner of the vehicle , to maximise the amount of space inside			1
inside there are four pedestal seats , which rotate 30 degrees when the doors are opened and then move back to a straight position when the car moves			1
there are also six high - resolution touch - screens on the doors , which passengers can use to control the car 's features or even see outside			2
they can be controlled using gestures , eye - tracking or touch			0
while the car is self - driving , it can project lights on to the road using its led headlights to let pedestrians know when to cross			2
the car can also switch to manual mode if you do n’t want it to do all the driving , with the driver ’s seat spinning to face forwards			0
mercedes have n’t announced when the @entity12 will be available yet , though , or how much it will cost			0
but perhaps this provides a better idea of what self - driving cars of the future might look like			0
the @entity12 has large 26 - inch wheels which are placed right in the corner of the vehicle , to maximise the amount of space inside the doors open like a carriage to reveal the spacious interior			2
