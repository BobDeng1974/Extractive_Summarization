she subtly slammed @entity1 over his history of rape allegations on an episode of @entity5 back in 2009			1
but this was not the first time @entity8 took on the comedian , as she called him out for allegedly drugging and molesting a woman during a @entity12 segment nine years ago			1
the actress co-anchored ' @entity14 ' with @entity15 and reported that @entity1 ca n't be held responsible as he was suffering from ' the brain damage ' , trying out her best impression			1
the joke was aired the week that @entity25 went on @entity26 to accuse @entity1 of rape			1
during the mock news report , ms @entity8 said : ' a @entity30 lawyer alleged wednesday that thirty years ago , @entity1 drugged her and tried to molest her , and after she fought back , he dropped two hundred - dollar bills on a table and fled			1
' @entity1 says he ca n't be held responsible for his actions , since at the time he was suffering from , " the brain damage "			2
' the actress co-anchored ' @entity14 ' with @entity15 and reported that @entity1 ca n't be held responsible as he was suffering from ' the brain damage ' , trying out her best impression when ms @entity15 asked if mr @entity22 would be coming out as @entity1 to defend himself , ms @entity8 continued her impression , saying , ' no , @entity41 is not coming out because of the ' @entity42 , ' and the money , and the sequels			1
' ' of course he ca n't talk about the boobies , and the groping , and the pudding pops , ' ms @entity15 added			2
when mr @entity22 did come on the set , as himself , he said , ' wow , thanks for that			0
great job , you guys			0
i did n't say any of that , because @entity22 loves to work , ok ? peace			0
' four years later , @entity58 - winning show @entity5 , which is produced by @entity59 and @entity60 , made a scathing reference to @entity1 's alleged history of assaulting women			1
in a clip from season three ' the bubble ' , @entity65 's @entity26 executive character @entity64 tries to get actor @entity69 , played by @entity70 , to come back to work at fictional television show @entity5			1
he does this by hiring a @entity1 impersonator to speak to the actor over the phone			2
but the plan backfires when @entity69 hears @entity1 's voice , and reveals he has some bad family history with the @entity80 star			2
the comedian used to be known as a moral pillar , an image he crafted through years of playing an upright dad on @entity80			0
that 's changed now 20 women have come forward to accuse him of rape @entity8 : a @entity30 lawyer alleged wednesday that thirty years ago , @entity1 drugged her and tried to molest her , and after she fought back , he dropped two hundred - dollar bills on a table and fled			1
@entity1 says he ca n't be held responsible for his actions , since at the time he was suffering from , ( imitating @entity1 ) ' the brain damage '			2
@entity15 : that 's funny			2
is @entity41 coming out to imitate @entity1 now ? @entity8 : ( still as @entity1 ) no , @entity41 is not coming out because of the ' @entity42 , ' and the money , and the sequels ! @entity15 : ( also as @entity1 ) of course he ca n't talk about the boobies , and the groping , and the pudding pops			1
@entity8 : because it would upset mr. @entity1 , and his wife , @entity101			1
( @entity22 walks in and stands behind @entity8 and @entity15 ) @entity22 : wow , thanks for that			1
great job , you guys			0
i did n't say any of that , because @entity22 loves to work , ok ? peace			0
( walks off ; some applause ) @entity8 : wow , @entity22 loves to work , everybody			0
@entity15 : loves to work ? who does n't ? ' @entity1 , you got a lotta nerve gettin ' on the phone wit ' me after what you did to my @entity119			2
' @entity120 yells down the line			0
' i think you 're confusing me with someone else , ' the baffled impersonator replies			0
she was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye ! ' @entity69 responds			0
the impersonator finds himself at a lack of words , saying : ' i 'm the guy … with the pudding … ' comedian @entity131 has been widely credited with the resurfacing rape allegations made against @entity1 in a stand - up routine that went viral in october this year			1
he unleashed a violent tirade against the 77 - year - old stand - up , calling him a ' rapist ' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a performance			0
not a @entity1 fan : @entity65 's character 's plan to get @entity69 ( played by @entity70 , right ) back to work backfires when @entity69 reveals an aunt 's traumatizing run - in with @entity1 in 1971 mr @entity145 has history with ms @entity8 as he spent a stretch back in 2010 as a writer on @entity5			1
it is not surprising that @entity8 knew about the rape allegations as she grew up in @entity151 , @entity152 near @entity153 , where they first became public			1
a former university employee @entity155 accused the star of fondling her in 2004			0
the case was ultimately thrown out a little over a year later , since authorities said they did n't have enough evidence to charge @entity1			0
instead , ms @entity155 filed a civil suit in march of that year , and found 13 other women willing to testify as witnesses showing @entity1 's pattern of disturbing behavior			0
the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in november 2006			0
