a record 247 million shoppers visited stores and websites over the @entity3 weekend this year , a figure almost equal to latest census figures for the total number of @entity8 citizens over the age of 14			1
the @entity10 released the figures on sunday , which reported that the number of shoppers this year was up nine percent from 226 million in 2011			1
according to the @entity15 , an estimated 308,745,538 people live in the @entity8			2
once you subtract everyone under 14 years of age from the total population , that means there are 247,518,325 people in this country , just over the number who went shopping this past weekend according to the @entity10			1
record breaking : nearly 250 million @entity8 went shopping over the @entity28 weekend , that 's the same number as there are citizens over 14 cash flow : the staggering number of shoppers brought in roughly $ 60 billion over the course of the four - day weekend deep pockets : retailers are extremely encouraged that the average shopper spent $ 423 over the weekend this @entity28 also saw @entity8 spending more than ever before			1
the average holiday spender dished out $ 423 over the entire weekend , up from $ 398 last year			2
meanwhile , total spending jumped nearly 13 per cent to $ 59.1 billion across the country			1
the @entity10 stats do n’t yet take into account the numbers for @entity44 which was also a record - breaker			1
sales grew 30 percent on last year according to @entity47			1
@entity48 are excited by these numbers , as they are seen as a successful start to the lucrative holiday season			0
there had been initial fears that the weak job market and impending tax hikes would depress spending during one of the busiest seasons for retailers			0
despite the financial doldrums many @entity8 are apparently in , they were encouraged to spend courtesy of a number of creative new features designed to make holiday shopping more convenient			2
specifically , @entity8 were spurred to shop thanks to efforts made by retailers to open stores on @entity28 evening , update mobile shopping apps for smartphones and tablets and expand shipping and layaway options			2
when shopping turns ugly : security guards had to break up a fight between angry shoppers waiting at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 shopping frenzy : a crowd goes wild over a $ 5 deal for headphones at @entity84 cyber monday was also a record - breaker , with sales up 30 percent on last year a surprising big loser over the record - breaking weekend for online sales was social media commerce , which saw a shocking 35 % drop in sales compared to last year			1
according to data released by @entity47 , just 0.34 % of all online sales on @entity3 came from people clicking through from social networks such as @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
in sharp contrast , customers shopping using their mobile phones and tablets increased , with sales and traffic both up by over 65 % , and @entity107 traffic doubling			0
in an uncharacteristic display , shops along @entity112 ’s @entity110 and @entity111 districts were brightly lit well past midnight , as lines of eager shoppers crowded along the blocks waiting to get in for their early openings			0
and for online shopping , lines were avoided altogether			0
according to @entity121 , which tracks digital spending , online sale rose a staggering 26 per cent to $ 1.04 billion on @entity3 , marking the first time such sales have surpassed $ 1 billion on that day			1
on cyber monday online sales were up more than 36 percent over @entity3			1
though there is still no data on how many more shoppers turned out thanks to the late - night openings , it does appear to have helped make @entity28 a more popular day for shopping			0
while in the past the third thursday of november was reserved for eating turkey and watching football , this year , it saw more people out shopping than in year ’s past			0
according to the @entity10 survey , the number of people who shopped on @entity28 rose 23.1 percent			0
@entity143 : people were encouraged to spend thanks to new features making shopping more convenient , @entity148 in @entity149 ( pictured ) started sales on @entity28 @entity151 : some shoppers avoided the lines by going online and @entity3 saw online sales top $ 1 billion all this has come as welcome news retailers across the country , many of whom can make upwards of 40 per cent of their annual revenue in november and december alone			1
they are hoping that this data will help buoy early , negative projections for the holiday season			0
the survey , however , did not bring all good news			0
it appears that early openings and increased sales on @entity28 may have dampened sales on @entity3 , which is still expected to be the biggest shopping day of the year			2
sales of @entity3 slipped to $ 11.2 billion , down nearly two per cent from last year and below estimates that they would hit at least $ 11.4 billion			1
meanwhile , the @entity10 estimates that overall sales in november and december will rise 4.1 percent this year to $ 586.1 billion			2
that 's more than a percentage point lower than the growth in each of the past two years , and the smallest increase since 2009 , when sales were nearly flat			0
still , retailers are hopeful and believe that last weekend 's earnings were just the start of what will be a successful holiday season			0
‘ retailers and consumers both won this weekend , especially on @entity28 , ’ said @entity185 , president and ceo of the @entity10 .			0

a record 247 million shoppers visited stories and websites over @entity3 weekend

cyber monday was also a record - breaker , with sales up 30 percent on last year
