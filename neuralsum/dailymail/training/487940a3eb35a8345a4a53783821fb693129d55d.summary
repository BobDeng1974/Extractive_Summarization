after his test with dr @entity11 , @entity2 added that it was not particularly comfortable but that it was ' certainly , obviously do - able '			2
making light of it : dr @entity11 joked that he was going to be extra thorough by checking with 2 fingers horror : from left to right , fellow hosts @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 react to the tests if prostate cancer is detected early , it is one of the most treatable			2
but many cases remain undetected because of the perceived embarrassment surrounding the prostate examination ; each year it claims around 29,000 lives and it is the second leading cause of cancer - related deaths in men			2
while undergoing a rectal examination does not seem like the most comfortable prospect , the seconds - long check could potentially save your life			1

@entity1 added : ' i think a lot of guys are also concerned about the embarrassment factor of it , so my advice would be find a doctor you 're very comfortable with			2
that embarrassment factor is not going to be an issue			0
' dr @entity11 said that the prostates felt normal , adding of @entity2 's : ' it 's a little enlarged , but it 's not terrible			1
' he said that if he had felt any problems , he would have given the men antibiotics in case it was simply an infection , before carrying out blood work			0

@entity1 and @entity2 have also been growing beards since the start of the month for ' no shave november ' - joining other men across the country in a bid to raise awareness of male cancers			1
before the check , the hosts said they were undergoing the procedure to dispel the myths around it and to show just how easy it is			1
' we 're trying to raise awareness , trying to get men of a certain age to go to the doctors to raise some of these issues , ' @entity1 said			1
' a lot of people have fears or concerns			0
