forests can typically take around 100 years to reach maturity , if they 're left to their own devices			0
but one eco-entrepreneur has managed to make the process ten times faster , creating green areas that are 30 times denser than a traditional forest			0
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , devised his system after a chance encounter with @entity13 forester @entity12			1
@entity7 ( pictured ) , from @entity8 in @entity9 has developed a system that allows forests to be grown ten times faster than traditional forests mr @entity7 was working at carmaker @entity18 when he signed up as for a @entity12 - led programme to create a green space for the company			1
he believed he could standardise the process to make the forest cost just over Â£ 500 ( $ 800 ) - or around the cost of an @entity25			2
by combining mr @entity12 's knowledge with his efficiency of industrial processes he managed to transform a 1,000 square foot ( 93 square metre ) plot into a lush , green area			1
the process involves analysing the soil to find out what species of tree will grow best in the area			2
saplings , which can reach up to 2ft 7 inches ( 80cm ) high , are then planted , with three to five saplings per square metre			1

in just two years of planting in his own garden , mr @entity7 had 300 trees , 42 species , of which 18 bore fruit , and 17 species of bird in an area where there had previously just been two			1
' our guava trees produce so much fruit that we harvest at least 5kg [ 11lb ] a day			0
' all my neighbours are getting guava nectar because we have such an abundance , ' mr @entity7 told @entity80 at the @entity81			0
mr @entity7 now has his own company , @entity82 , which has , so far , planted 43,000 trees for 33 clients based in @entity9			1
in cities , he claims mini-forests could help combat pollution and reduce the heating caused by concrete in large urban areas absorbing sunlight			0

pictured are saplings before being planted ' our plan is to automate the system so that we can give anyone anywhere in the world step - by - step instructions on how to plant a native forest , ' mr @entity7 told @entity104 blogs			1
' we plan to crowd source knowledge of native tree species ; i 'm working on a website for this part of the project , and plan to launch it within a year			0
' to make soil analysis easy for remote clients , mr @entity7 also hopes to develop a small , gps - enabled soil probe that will test soil and upload the data onto their servers			2
when the probe is integrated with our database , at the push of a button you 'll know the soil constituents and what nutrients it needs , and we 'll be able to immediately send a complete species list and a detailed procedure , ' he said .			0

the process involves planting three to five saplings per square metre
in the first three years , the forest needs to be *watered* and weeded
but in about eight months , the dense forest becomes self - sustaining
