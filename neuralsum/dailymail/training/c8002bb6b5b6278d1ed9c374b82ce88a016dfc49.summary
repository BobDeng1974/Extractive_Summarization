by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 05:41 est , 7 january 2014 this scene outside the @entity3 yesterday could be the most elite picket line in the history of @entity7 industrial relations			0
the group of lawyers – clearly in a light - hearted mood – walked out in a nationwide barristers ’ protest against legal aid cuts			1
they insist the reductions in fees paid by the taxpayer will stop bright legal brains becoming criminal lawyers			1
she was among thousands of barristers across the @entity7 to stage a protest against legal aid cuts some junior barristers earn as little as £ 13,000 a year , their leaders said			1
but perhaps it was a mistake for one protester to have her exclusive @entity38 handbag on show			0
the accessory – list price £ 1,100 – belongs to @entity21 , 31 , who would have struggled to buy it on such a salary			1
however , @entity45 - educated miss @entity21 later claimed the handbag was a gift from her mother and says on her @entity49 account that defence barristers usually earn £ 50 a day before deductions			2
she was among thousands of lawyers to protest against justice secretary @entity54 's plans to slash a further £ 200million from the annual £ 2.1billion legal aid bill by 2018/19			1
having fun : females barristers ( left to right ) @entity58 , @entity21 and @entity59 enjoy a joke outside the @entity3 yesterday action : justice secretary @entity54 plans to slash £ 200million from the annual £ 2.1billion legal aid bill by 2018/19			1
but barristers insist the reductions in fees will stop bright legal brains becoming criminal lawyers the cuts target the fees paid to barristers defending criminals			1
yesterday @entity71 , chairman of the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) , warned of the effects			0
‘ you are going to see cases collapsing , as has already started , ’ he said			0
‘ without people coming into the system , there will be nobody of ability to prosecute serious cases			2
’ he also accused mr @entity54 of ' manipulating ' official figures to falsely portray lawyers doing criminal aid work as high - earning ' fat cats '			1
he added that the average barrister involved in the work earned around £ 36,000			2
the @entity88 has said it was vital to scale back the most expensive legal aid scheme in the world and insisted it will remain ' very generous ' even after the changes			1
walk out : barristers outside @entity95 @entity94 join in with the protest against cuts to legal aid budget placards : lawyers walked out of @entity101 in @entity102 yesterday in protest against the cuts in arms : barristers and solicitors not in their wigs outside @entity109 yesterday morning the department - highlighted figures showing that 1,200 barristers judged to be working full - time on taxpayer - funded criminal work received £ 100,000 each in fee income last year			1
six barristers picked up more than £ 500,000 each , it said			2
the @entity117 has warned that any barristers who stay away from court will almost certainly be in breach of their professional code of conduct with ' very serious consequences '			2
it urged the @entity72 to call off the action which it said could harm the interests of clients , others involved in a case and public confidence in the administration of justice			0
the reforms also include limits on prisoners ' access to legal aid , a household disposable income threshold for criminal legal aid and reductions in the cost of fees for representation			1
lawyers have not called action today a ' strike ' over their obligations to the @entity149			2
cuts : the government say they must ' scale back ' the legal aid system - which is the most expensive in the world			1
lawyers at @entity155 ( pictured ) were among those to walk out in protest yesterday at the @entity3 , two brothers who allegedly plotted to travel abroad for terrorist training appeared without the assistance of their solicitors			2
jurors in the case of @entity164 and @entity165 were reminded by @entity3 judge @entity166 that the ' lonely ' courtroom was a result of the strikes taking place			0
it was one of a number of cases to suffer setbacks as a result of the action			0
around 70 barristers gathered outside @entity95 @entity94 to back the walk - out and hear @entity179 read out a statement condemning the government 's proposals			2
and around 150 protesters gathered outside the entrance to @entity102 's @entity101 where some pre-trial hearings were being held without all barristers present			2
demonstration : lawyers demonstrate at the @entity3			0
many cases were heard without legal representation warning : the @entity117 agency warned those who walked out - like these lawyers in @entity194 - could face serious consequences many outside were dressed in their wigs and robes with some holding placards with the words ' save @entity7 justice ' and ' no legal aid cuts '			1
@entity203 dealt only with cases involving vulnerable children and adults this morning because of the walk - out			0
earlier , mr @entity208 told the @entity209 : ' you are going to see cases collapsing , as they have already started			0
there are cases of murders , murder trials , that have collapsed because of them being inadequately prosecuted - that leads to enormous concerns for the victim 's family			0
' secondly , the barristers will not work , they have made that quite clear , at rates that take them , as one person was telling me of his earnings today , to around £ 13,000 as a taxable income			1
' that is a somebody with a law degree and a masters in public international law - why would they work at those rates ? the @entity88 stood by its proposals today - saying lawyers , pictured at @entity101 , would still be well paid under the proposals ' this is how the public will see it as far as prosecution is concerned - without people coming into the system there will simply be nobody of ability to prosecute serious cases			1
' where will paedophiles and rapists be living ? not doing the 100 - year terms of which the government speaks but , i am afraid , next door to the public			0
' but mr @entity208 , whose own case was moved to the afternoon , said the same official statistics showed that - after allowing for vat and other expenses - the average barrister involved in the work earned around £ 36,000			0
the @entity258 calculated that it was lower still - around the £ 27,000 national average , he said , meaning the cuts would push people away from the vital work			1
' there are simply going to be no people of any ability prepared to do criminal legal aid work , ' mr @entity208 said			1
accusation : the chair of the @entity72 accused justice secretary @entity54 of ' manipulating ' official figures			0
above , barristers protest outside @entity95 @entity94 in a dig at the release of the earnings figures , he said he had been contacted by one barrister who was earning £ 13,680 in her second year of practice			1
' you can put out the earnings of five to 10 people , but you ca n't run the justice system on the efforts of five to 10 people , ' he said			0
@entity281 , the shadow justice secretary , said : ' no - one wants to see disruption in our courts but this unprecedented action shows how relations between the legal profession and @entity288 have collapsed as a result of policies which could restrict access to our courts to only those who can afford it			0
' the lord chancellor swears an oath to uphold the law of the land , so for @entity54 to have lost the confidence of the legal community he relies on to deliver on this oath is extremely worrying			0
' @entity303 , chief executive of the @entity304 , addressed a protest outside @entity109			0
after speaking , she said : ' abolition of legal aid for prisoners , including teenagers and mothers separated from their babies , is politically motivated and not based on hard financial sense			1
' it will mean people spend months , or even years , longer in jail unnecessarily because will no longer get legal support to get the courses they need in prison and to move through the prison maze			2
' an @entity88 spokesman said : ' we entirely agree lawyers should be paid fairly for their work , and believe our proposals do just that			0
' we also agree legal aid is a vital part of our justice system - that 's why we have to find efficiencies to ensure it remains sustainable and available to those most in need of a lawyer			1
' agencies involved in the criminal justice system will take steps to minimise any upset court disruption could cause for victims and witnesses involved in trials			0
