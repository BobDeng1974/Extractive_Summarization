by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 19 september 2013 what could be better than a free ticket to see your favourite sports team ? well maybe if it came complete with a hot date to sweeten the deal			1
that 's exactly the kind of once - in - a - lifetime deal one man offered on the @entity11 , @entity13 @entity12 , when he gave readers the chance to take his step - daughter to see the @entity17			1
@entity18 explained that 27 - year - old @entity20 's date had suddenly backed out of their arrangement to go the @entity17 ' forthcoming september 21 away clash with the @entity24			1
free ticket ! the advert posted by @entity18 on the @entity11 , @entity13 @entity12 personals site soliciting a date to accompany his 27 - year - old step - daughter @entity20 to a college football game this saturday but instead of swallowing the $ 150 loss he posted her pictures to the notorious personal ads site in the hope of finding an eligible gentleman to accompany her			1
the advert , decorated with pictures of the attractive young woman , read : ' my step - daughter 's date backed out ( his loss , your gain ) for the game ... ' free ticket for the @entity50 game this saturday ( cost to me , $ 150 ) on the 40 for the right gentleman			1
you must be an attractive , professional , single well educated gentleman , with a good sense of humor , 25 - 33			2
you also must not be threatened by an attractive , professional , single well educated lady , ( as she is )			0
if you do not qualify , please pass this ad to a friend			0
' the fine print : i lied ! ( sorry ... not totally free )			0
your cost will be a modest dinner , drinks and delightful conversation with her before or after the game			0
' with its reputation for serial killers and prostitution , many parents would perhaps be nervous at the thought of sending their child off with an unknown person solicited from @entity12			0
but what the advert did not reveal was that the date would be fully chaperoned			1
mr @entity18 told @entity78 that he and his wife @entity79 are also flying down for the game on saturday			2
the chosen one will sit with them and @entity82 at the game			0
chaperoned : mr @entity84 's advert did not reveal that he and his wife would also be travelling with miss @entity20 to the @entity86 in @entity13 to watch the volunteers take on the @entity24 this saturday the lifelong @entity88 fan said his inbox had been inundated with offers since the ad - now removed - was posted on monday night			1
' i 've had a couple of lighthearted responses , one of them was hilarious , but yeah , it 's been mostly serious responses â€” i would guess , i do n't know , 30 or 40 , ' he said			2
and he added that he had run the idea by @entity82 before posting the advert and she would have the final say over who would be invited			0
' i would n't do something like that without her permission , ' he said .			0

@entity18 offered ticket to take @entity20 after her date pulled out
he says he 's been inundated with offers to accompany the 27 - year - old
but advert - since removed - did not reveal he would be chaperoning
