referee @entity0 has apologised for wrongly sending off @entity2 's @entity1 during his side 's 3 - 0 loss at @entity5			1
@entity1 was a victim of mistaken identity when he was shown a red card after @entity8 fouled @entity9 in the second minute of the @entity11 clash at the @entity12			1
@entity0 has now admitted to his error in a statement from @entity15 , the organisation responsible for refereeing appointments			2
referee @entity0 shows a red card to @entity1 ( right ) during the second minute of @entity2 's match at @entity5			1
but it was @entity8 who committed the original foul on @entity9 @entity2 defender @entity8 makes a challenge on @entity5 striker @entity9 the @entity24 striker tumbles to the ground under @entity8 's challenge @entity27 showed the incident from referee @entity0 's perspective , with no 25 @entity8 the closest to him @entity9 continues but @entity1 then comes in with a challenge of his own inside the area @entity9 goes to ground again under @entity1 's challenge and the @entity2 player is sent off @entity9 heads to the @entity12 turf after being challenged by @entity1 the @entity2 players protest as @entity1 is shown the red card by referee @entity0 1 @entity1 loses the ball inside his own half , with striker @entity9 now bearing down on goal 2 @entity8 comes across and makes the tackle , sending @entity9 crashing to the ground 3 referee @entity0 steps in , blowing his whistle to stop play 4 but @entity9 has picked himself up quickly and continues to run with the ball into the penalty area , clearly not having heard the whistle 5 @entity1 then comes back to put in another tackle on the @entity5 striker 6 play finally stops and @entity0 beckons a player across to him			1
@entity8 does not move , however , putting his hands on his leg 7 instead , @entity1 walks across to the referee and is then shown the red card 8 @entity1 can be seen saying ' it was n't me ' as players surround the referee			1
but their protests are to no avail the statement read : ' in the second minute of @entity5 v @entity2 , referee @entity0 made a decision to send off @entity1 for a ' denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity ' offence			1
' the referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player , which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity			1
the referee has apologised for his error			0
' @entity0 left the @entity2 players stunned and manager @entity80 livid after showing @entity1 a straight red card when @entity8 had committed the original offence			1
@entity1 's sending off left @entity2 with 88 minutes to hold out against @entity5 with just 10 men @entity1 was seen mouthing the words ' it 's not me ' to referee @entity0 but it was n't enough to change the decision			1
at half - time , @entity0 admitted to @entity27 that the first number he saw after the incident was @entity91 23 , leading to the case of mistaken identity			1
speaking on @entity27 at half - time , pundit @entity94 said : ' it 's just a simple case of mistaken identity			1
the decision is right , @entity9 is through and he 's denied a goalscoring opportunity			0
it 's a red card			0
the two players mistaken by referee @entity102 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) @entity1 walks past his manager @entity80 as he leaves the field ' it 's a simple thing for the referee , @entity0 , he 's just sent the wrong man off			1
he 's sent @entity102 off , he should have sent @entity8 off			0
one 's no 25 , the other 's @entity109			0
' @entity112 added : ' @entity8 's head is down initially because he think he 's getting sent off			2
he just calls the players over , he does n't call anybody specific			0
' in the end , @entity1 comes over rather than @entity8			2
in that situation , @entity8 should be holding his hands up			0
it 's a case of mistaken identity			2
it 's a shame really because it 's killed the game			0
' because @entity123 's sending off in @entity125 match at @entity126 three weeks ago was a case of mistaken identity , both he and @entity128 got away with bans			1
when asked whether the challenge warranted a red card , @entity130 said : ' absolutely , he 's the last defender			0
@entity9 is through one - on - one with the referee , it 's definitely a red card			2
' the red card was shown just 89 seconds into the match at the @entity12 , leaving @entity2 with a mountain to climb against the defending champions			0
@entity139 sent off @entity125 's @entity123 instead of @entity128 after a foul on @entity141			1
@entity2 players @entity142 , @entity144 and @entity145 were seen protesting to @entity0 as the players left the field for half - time , but to no avail			0
with 88 minutes to hold out with 10 men , the @entity2 lasted 25 until @entity9 spun inside the box and fired home his first for the club			0
@entity153 doubled their advantage five minutes before the break , smashing home after @entity2 failed to clear a corner			0
and @entity158 made absolutely sure 13 minutes from the end , turning home @entity162 's shot with a faint touch			0
@entity123 is given his marching orders during the match at @entity126 despite the fact it was @entity128 the former @entity168 player and @entity170 columnist @entity167 wrote on @entity171 : ' another case of mistaken identity in a sending off in today 's game at the @entity12			1
referees need help ! ' we need technology in the biggest sport in the world ! ! how long do we have to wait ? ' goal line technology has helped the game but came too late			0
i would start with mistaken identity for red / yellow cards a monitor for the fourth official or the match assessor upstairs to help one of their colleagues			2
' the referee must know from the players reaction he 's made a mistake but ca n't be seen to change his decision that must surely affect the rest of his performance ? last season @entity198 wrongly showed @entity200 a red card when @entity202 handled @entity200 is sent off by referee @entity198 during the @entity11 match between @entity204 and @entity205 ' we can then see how far we can take technology but we have to start somewhere			2
@entity2 wo n't have anyone suspended now either ! ' it is the second such incident in @entity210 in the space of three weeks			0
on february 28 , referee @entity139 mistakenly sent off @entity125 's @entity123 rather than @entity128 after a foul on @entity213 striker @entity141			1
and last season , @entity198 wrongly showed @entity200 a red card when @entity202 handled on the line in @entity205 's 6 - 0 defeat at @entity204			2
@entity200 appeals to @entity198 after receiving a red card during the match at @entity220			0
