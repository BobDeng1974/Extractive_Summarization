by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 12:14 est , 14 june 2013 @entity1 has announced new guidelines to recognise the gender category ' intersex ' on official documents			2
under the new system , which will come into effect from july 1 , individuals will not be required to have undergone sex reassignment surgery or hormone therapy to select the new category			1
since 2011 @entity1 nationals who were biologically not entirely male or female , have been able to select ' x ' as a gender category on their passports			2
third sex : the @entity1 government is to recognise ' intersex ' as a gender category on official documents transgender people have been able to pick whether they are male or female providing their choice is supported by a doctor			1
the changes mean people will now have the option to select @entity28 ( male ) , @entity30 ( female ) or @entity31 )			0
it follows a recommendation by the @entity34 in 2009 for the government to consider setting out guidelines for the collection of sex and gender information			1
since 2011 @entity1 nationals have been able to select ' x ' as a gender category on their passports according to @entity1 's attorney - general @entity45 the new guidelines will make it easier for people to establish or change their sex or gender in personal records held by federal government departments and agencies			1
he said : ' we recognise individuals may identify , and be recognised within the community , as a gender other than the gender they were assigned at birth or during infancy , or as an indeterminate gender			2
' this should be recognised and reflected in their personal records held by departments and agencies			0
' if an @entity1 wants to change the gender entry on their personal record , the government will now accept a statement from their doctor or psychologist , a valid @entity1 passport or a state or territory birth certificate or other document which shows their preferred status			0
mr @entity45 said : ' transgender and intersex people in @entity1 face many issues trying to ensure the gender status on their personal records matches the gender they live and how they are recognised by the community			0
' these guidelines will bring about a practical improvement in the everyday lives of transgender , intersex and gender diverse people			0
