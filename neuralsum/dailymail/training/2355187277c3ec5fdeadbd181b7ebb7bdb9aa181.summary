by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 27 february 2013 @entity1 , the @entity3 pug who might just be the most hilarious dog ever			1
adorable little @entity1 looks just like any ordinary pug until she starts doing one thing : trying to run			1
and thanks to her @entity9 family who have captured their cherished pet 's funny movements in a series of musical home videos , @entity1 is now entertaining the world via her very own @entity17 channel - which has already notched up over four million hits			1
@entity19 - who suffers from a neurological condition called ataxia which is not painful or life - threatening - is now known as ' the pug that could not run ' due to her first home video of the same name , which has gone viral with almost 3.5m @entity17 hits			1
the video shows @entity1 dancing around in fields with her dog siblings , all of whom can run perfectly normally			0
@entity19 , however , bounces and trips around the grass , rolly - pollying into mud puddles and leaping into the air as if she 's been given a series of small electric shocks			0
alongside the action a ' @entity1 ' voiceover sings : ' well hello , my name is @entity1 and i 'm a special pug			1
' i live in @entity9 , @entity3 , and my favourite thing 's a hug			1
i love to eat roast chicken and my friends say i 'm good fun , but the one thing that i can not do is i ca n't fe * * * n ' run			0
' to ensure no viewers worry about the health of @entity60 - whose name means ' crazy ' in @entity63 - owner @entity62 has issued a statement at the end of the video saying : ' @entity67 , just so everyone understands , @entity1 suffers from a mild brain disorder			1
' it is operable but risky and as the vet says she is unaware anything is wrong with her and will live a long and healthy life , we decided not to risk losing her			0
' she is loved by all , spoilt rotten and closely protected by the other dogs and lives her life to the full despite her difficulty running			1
all that said she is very funny to watch so we thought we should share with others and hope she brings as much joy to you as she does to us			0

@entity1 the pug , the little dog with the big heart and the very funny run @entity19 's video demonstrates how she runs with her brothers and sisters in @entity9 , @entity3 loca with her family in @entity9 , @entity3 loca at the end of her video , in which she tells her audience not to worry about her since she 's perfectly happy there are three clinical types of ataxia : sensory ( proprioceptive ) , vestibular , and cerebellar			1
all three types produce changes in limb coordination , but vestibular and cerebellar ataxia also produce changes in head and neck movement			2
@entity121 ( proprioceptive ) ataxia occurs when the spinal cord is slowly compressed			2
a typical outward symptom of sensory ataxia is misplacing the feet , accompanied by a progressive weakness as the disease advances			2
sensory ataxia can occur with spinal cord , brain stem ( the lower part of the brain near the neck ) , and cerebral locations of lesions			2
the vestibulocochlear nerve carries information concerning balance from the inner ear to the brain			0
damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve can cause changes in head and neck position , as the affected animal may feel a false sense of movement , or may be having problems with hearing			0
outward symptoms include leaning , tipping , falling , or even rolling over			0
central vestibular signs usually have changing types of eye movements , sensory deficits , weakness in the legs ( all or one sided ) , multiple cranial nerve signs , and drowsiness , stupor , or coma			0
peripheral vestibular signs do not include changes in mental status , vertical eye movements , sensory deficits , or weakness in the legs			0
cerebellar ataxia is reflected in uncoordinated motor activity of the limbs , head and neck , taking large steps , stepping oddly , head tremors , body tremors and swaying of the torso			2
there is an inadequacy in the performance of motor activity and in strength preservation			0
