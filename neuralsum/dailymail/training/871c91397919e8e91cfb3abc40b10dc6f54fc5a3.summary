defensively against @entity1 , @entity0 were all over the place			1
but forget three at the back or four at the back			0
they could play any system they want but it would make no difference — the players are just not good enough			1
so much has been said about @entity11 and how he is going to take the 3 - 5 - 2 that worked so well with @entity13 at the @entity14 and use it with @entity0			1
but i ’m already sick of talking about systems			0
it does n’t matter what formation @entity0 play , it ’s about the quality of the players and at @entity0 that quality is sorely lacking at the moment			1
in a way having a decent pre-season was the worst thing that could have happened to @entity25 as all it did was raise expectations			2
the good news for him , though , is that he still has time to bring in some new faces , but who is going to want to come in ? the way @entity0 are at the minute you could get @entity25 , @entity54 and @entity55 to manage them together and even they would have a job getting them back into the top four			1
tough ask : even @entity55 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) would have a job lifting united up one and only : @entity29 is perhaps the only @entity0 player who would get in @entity39 or @entity38 's team class : @entity29 scored to equalise for @entity0 against @entity1 on saturday @entity65 can become @entity67 's @entity66 data courtesy of the @entity69 , the @entity70 of the @entity71 before he broke his leg in 2010 , @entity65 was talked about as one of the best young players in @entity75			1
he is truly living up to that billing			0
@entity67 did not play that well against @entity78 but @entity65 is starting to become like their own @entity66			1
@entity66 was so good at scoring vital goals for @entity39 , particularly late on			2
now @entity65 is doing the same			2
he ’s full of confidence and he is like a magnet to the ball in the area			1
he is a phenomenal athlete , as his running stats below show			0
he covered more ground than any other player in the game and that energy and athleticism is why he is finding himself in the right place at the right time so often			0
poached : @entity65 pumps his fist after grabbing @entity67 's winner against @entity78 city have to keep their spine solid of all the top sides to play this weekend , @entity38 looked the most accomplished			1
they had the trickiest fixture away at @entity98 but still had more than enough quality to put them away			0
lots of people have tipped @entity39 to win it this season but @entity38 will make a much better fist of retaining the title than they did the last time they won it			1
the key for @entity38 is keeping the spine of their team fit			1
@entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 only started five @entity71 games together last season , but @entity38 still won the trophy			1
if they can keep those boys playing , there is no reason why they ca n’t go on to defend it this time around			0
spine : @entity38 showed their strength during the 2 - 0 win over @entity98 saints to survive after the firesale on the south coast this summer , plenty of people expect @entity134 to be battling relegation			1
@entity138 is a beast in midfield , @entity137 is an asset if he stays and @entity142 is an excellent young player			0
nobody expects them to do as well as last season but they proved at @entity147 they are still a good side and they were unlucky to lose			0
fight : saints surprised a few with their promising performance at @entity147 on sunday credit to @entity155 there were some impressive results over the weekend and @entity155 ’s win at @entity159 was the second best of the lot , only behind @entity1 's victory at @entity162			1
everybody would have had them down to get beaten three or four - nil but they were set up perfectly , so credit to @entity167 and @entity168			0
at @entity170 last year the pressure suffocated them but on the road they are free to sit back and counter			0
vital start : @entity155 took a surprising three points away from @entity159 , with many tipping them to go down @entity177 delighted with team effort penalty problems it was not a good weekend for penalty takers			1
@entity182 missed his first penalty in years for @entity184 and @entity185 missed the chance to get a vital point on the board for @entity189			0
i missed one or two in my career , but i ’ve never understood why players try to place the ball			2
it ’s ok if you send the keeper the wrong way , but if he guesses right you give him a chance with a weaker shot			0
sometimes it ’s just better to put your foot through it ! disappointing : @entity203 saves @entity185 's penalty as @entity205 beat @entity189 1 - 0 on saturday bring on @entity206 we all know what to expect from @entity39 on monday night , but i think a lot of people are going to enjoy watching @entity206 this year			1
@entity212 has done brilliantly to get them back in the @entity71 and i like the way they play their football			2
keep an eye out for @entity218 and @entity219 , two youngsters set to impress			0
at 23 , @entity218 could go on to be an @entity221 right back			0
he is a good crosser of the ball , is good at set - pieces at both ends of the pitch and he takes a good free - kick			2
as for @entity219 , he is a real livewire and after 26 goals last season he means business			0
excitement : @entity212 faces his first test as a @entity71 manager ... against @entity39 2 - @entity78 might have wished @entity234 had stuck around a little longer after their opening - day defeat by @entity67			1
both goals they conceded at the @entity239 came from set - pieces , but in 26 @entity71 games under @entity243 last season , @entity78 let in only one from set - plays			2
3 - formerly known for their steely defence , @entity159 have become a bit leaky of late			0
@entity249 ’s side have managed to keep only three clean sheets in their last 23 @entity71 matches			2
@entity29 is edging closer to @entity253 's number 174 - @entity29 scored his 174th @entity71 goal			1
he is now just one short of @entity253 in the all - time list			0
7 - some players are clearly more comfortable playing away from home and @entity259 is one of them			2
seven of his eight @entity71 goals for @entity1 have come on the road			1
6 - @entity262 has become a useful player for @entity264			2
the @entity265 has been involved in six goals in his past nine games , scoring four and setting up two			0
22 - @entity268 was the main man at @entity269 last season but @entity272 ’s goals were more valuable			0
including last season and sunday ’s strike against @entity134 , @entity272 ’s goals have been worth 22 points to @entity269			0
84 - it was not the debut @entity279 would have had in mind , but the young @entity0 defender completed more passes than any other player in the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity1 .			1

@entity25 has brought a new system , but @entity0 need better players
@entity29 is perhaps the only @entity0 player who could play for @entity38 or @entity39
@entity55 and @entity54 would struggle to lift this @entity0 team
@entity0 lost 2 - 1 to @entity1 in their @entity71 opener
@entity65 is full of confidence and is like a magnet to the ball in the area
@entity38 looked the most accomplished of all teams to play so far
@entity134 and @entity155 both impressed over the weekend
