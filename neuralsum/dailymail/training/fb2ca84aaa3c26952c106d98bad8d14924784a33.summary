the mascara is good , very thick and lasts all day and it 's good to know that it 's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it			0
it 's pretty tough to get off though , we recommend using a gentle eye make - up remover like @entity238 's @entity237 remover as it can be quite stubborn			1

however , it is very , very black so may be too heavy on some fair - haired ladies			2
