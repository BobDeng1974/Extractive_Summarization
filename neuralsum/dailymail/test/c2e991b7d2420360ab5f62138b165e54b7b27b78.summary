what if they come fifth ? @entity2 may have big plans to revamp the team in the summer , with @entity5 and @entity6 among the high - profile casualties , but what if @entity8 reel them in over the next six matches ? city are four points clear and have a superior goal difference , which equates to five , yet undoubtedly they are vulnerable			1
for a team playing this poorly no run - in is easy and matches against the much - improved @entity17 and even @entity18 can no longer be viewed with certainty			0
@entity5 ( centre ) has been a shadow of the player who fired @entity2 to last season 's title @entity25 ( second right ) trudges off the pitch after @entity2 were beaten by @entity28 future opponents @entity29 and @entity31 have little to play for — yet neither did @entity28			1
the long - term plan is plain : @entity34 , at his convenience , probably in 2016			1
yet where will @entity2 be by then ? an overhaul of playing personnel is due , but there has been scant evidence @entity25 or director of football @entity41 are adept at identifying replacements			2
@entity44 was supposed to be a different class to @entity46 , but the @entity48 ’s most expensive defender can not command a place in the team ; @entity51 is no @entity52 ; fernando no great upgrade on @entity54 or @entity55			0
@entity5 is in obvious decline , but his influence on @entity2 ’s two title winning seasons was huge			2
can @entity25 and @entity41 be trusted to find a replacement capable of @entity5 ’s impact ? not on the evidence of their recent signings			0
@entity65 ? @entity66 ? even @entity67 is not as good as he was at @entity68			0
the powers that be at @entity2 are waiting for @entity34 to leave @entity70 for @entity71 and what if @entity2 are caught and condemned to the @entity73 ? what happens to this lavish rebuilding plan then ? take away the @entity77 money and @entity2 ’s financial capacity is not really much greater than @entity79 ’s			1
@entity25 has performed weakly this season and keeping him on another year while marking time for @entity34 is a giant gamble			1
@entity83 got @entity2 into the elite in the nick of time with the financial fair play regulations about to be introduced			2
locked outside , @entity2 ’s capacity to improve would be severely limited			0
would @entity34 even come in those circumstances ? great manager he may be , but not one that has shown any burning desire to work off the same budget as @entity94 .			0

@entity2 currently occupy final @entity77 place
@entity8 are four points behind @entity2 with six matches to go this season
