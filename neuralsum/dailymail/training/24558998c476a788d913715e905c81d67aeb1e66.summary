by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:19 est , 2 december 2013 a team of @entity5 cybercriminals have created a computer virus so sophisticated it can steal the money from any bank account in any country			2
called the @entity11 , it lies hidden on malicious websites or infected computers and can steal the usernames and passwords for people ’s online banking accounts			1
once it has access to these accounts it can empty them completely and is so advanced , security experts are warning that traditional antivirus software is n't enough to keep users protected			0
the @entity11 , created by @entity5 hackers , uses a variety of advanced methods to infect computers and steal usernames and passwords for online bank accounts			1
once a hacker has access to a bank account they can empty it and its makers claim the @entity11 can attack ' any bank in any country ' @entity36 sits on malicious websites and can infect computers when users click on links to these dangerous sites			1
special scripts have been created for the @entity44 and @entity45 browsers and these give the cybercriminals remote access to the user ’s computer			0
once a computer is infected , @entity36 can record the usernames and passwords to online bank accounts			1
this information is sent to hackers who can then use it to gain access to accounts			0
after gaining access to a user ’s account , cybercriminals make transactions and transfer money from the user to their own accounts or - to keep the trail from leading directly to them - to the accounts of other victims			0
@entity72 said protection against threats such as @entity36 requires more than ‘ just standard antivirus ’ and advises customers to be extra vigilant to make sure they only access official sites and do n’t store passwords in cookies , or on their computers			1
this is because the @entity11 has been designed to contain ‘ just about every possible trick ’ known to hackers to avoid being caught and disabled			2
according to security firm @entity72 , @entity36 has already made ‘ several thousand attempts ’ to infect computers and is targeting some of the world ’s biggest banks and investment companies			1

it is believed the @entity11 is focusing its attention on @entity92 ’s customers because their online accounts also have information about stocks and shares			1
‘ this gives malicious users the chance to not only transfer cash funds to their own accounts but also to play the stock market , using the accounts and the money of @entity119 victims ’ , said @entity72 @entity36 sits on malicious websites and can infect computers when users click on links to these dangerous sites			1
