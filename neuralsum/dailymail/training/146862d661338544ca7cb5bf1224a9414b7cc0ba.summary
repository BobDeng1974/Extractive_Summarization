a mother whose sex offender ex-boyfriend murdered her infant daughter has branded his 25 - year prison term too lenient			2
@entity6 was today given the life sentence tariff in @entity8 for the murder of 15 - month - old @entity10 in what the judge described as a ' sadistic sexual assault '			1
but @entity14 , the toddler 's mother , criticised the sentence , saying : ' twenty - five years is n't long enough			1
ms @entity10 branded the sentence too lenient saying : ' 25 years is n't long enough ' guilty : @entity6 ( pictured with his 15 - month - old victim in his arms ) was found guilty of her murder by a unanimous verdict @entity6 pictured at @entity27 of the @entity28 with @entity29 in his arms on the evening she was admitted , she died from head injuries the following day her mother and @entity10 's grandmother @entity33 said 33 - year - old @entity6 , who was not the child 's father , should never be freed			1
she said : ‘ it was n't long enough - life should be life			1
' ‘ he should never see the light of day again			0
we wo n't ever see @entity10 , her mummy wo n't ever see her wee daughter and life should mean life			1
’ @entity6 took @entity10 to @entity28 in @entity43 , @entity44 after she sustained serious injuries from his attacks			1
he was filmed trying to give her @entity47 , but the 15 - month - old girl later died			0
@entity6 's father @entity49 insisted he was innocent of the murder and would be appealing against the verdict			1
he said : ‘ we will be appealing the case and we know he will be proved innocent			0
' in setting the minimum term @entity6 must serve of his life sentence , mr justice @entity55 explained that the sentencing framework in @entity44 was very different to that in @entity60 and @entity61 , where a whole life term could be handed down			2
tragic : @entity6 took @entity10 to hospital after she sustained horrific injuries from his attacks horrific : @entity10 died in hospital a day after she was admitted with devastating injuries behind bars : @entity6 will serve at least 25 years in prison , a sentence criticised by the girl 's mother he said the offence was serious enough to use the upward starting point guide of 15 to 16 years			1
explaining that aggravating features , among them the vulnerability and fragility of the victim , required him to make a ‘ substantial upward adjustment ’ , he told @entity79 he would have to serve at least 25 years			0
once the 25 - year term is spent , @entity6 can only be released , on licence , if parole commissioners deem he no longer presents a danger to the public			2
setting the minimum sentence @entity6 must serve , judge @entity55 told the labourer at @entity8 he was a ' deeply manipulative man '			2
@entity6 was also found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent and sexual assault of @entity10			1
mr @entity55 told him he must serve at least six and two years for those crimes respectively , but those terms will run concurrently with his murder tariff			0
@entity6 , clean shaven and dressed in a grey jumper , showed little emotion as the judge delivered his sentencing decisions			2
his ex-girlfriend ms @entity10 looked on from the public gallery			2
at the same trial last year , she was acquitted of charges of allowing her daughter ’s death and cruelty through wilful neglect			0
@entity6 met ms @entity10 just three months before the little girl 's death			1
he quickly eased his way into the family home in @entity111 , which allowed him access to @entity10			0
the judge said @entity6 had duped ms @entity10 into believing he cared for @entity10 and she was therefore willing to leave her daughter alone with him			1
he said : ‘ you gained the total trust of @entity14 , you appeared to her to be very good to @entity10 , ’ he said			1
on the night the toddler sustained the fatal injuries , @entity6 had persuaded his girlfriend to go out to a shop to buy him a chocolate bar			1
justice @entity55 said he was already on his way up the stairs with the intention of sexually abusing the young child in her bed as ms @entity10 was reversing her car out of the driveway			0
the judge said @entity6 had struck @entity10 's head on a hard surface in response to her cries as he inflicted a brutal sexual assault			1
that head injury would ultimately kill her			2
anger : @entity14 , pictured outside court today , said that she thought the sentence was inadequate @entity139 leaves @entity8 with her family after hearing @entity6 's sentence a pathologist found that @entity10 had suffered 21 cracked ribs , seven of which were old , while the rest had happened in the ten days before her death			1
multiple bruises were also found on the youngster 's body along with a clearly visible oval shaped bump on her forehead			0
during the post-mortem examination , the pathologist found injuries to her abdomen caused by punching or prodding which would also have been fatal			0
@entity10 had also been sexually assaulted			0
the prosecution described the attacks on her as vile and sadistic			0
@entity6 blamed @entity10 's mother , claiming at trial that she had inflicted the injuries on her own daughter and that he was sickened by her death			1
speaking only through his barrister , he alleged that ms @entity10 did not want social services involved because she had done these ' terrible things ' herself			0
but in a case with no forensic evidence to suggest who inflicted @entity10 's injuries , the jury rejected @entity6 's claims and accepted that ms @entity10 had unwittingly let a monster into her home , taking just three hours to reach a unanimous verdict			1
he was found guilty of murder , sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm			0
ms @entity10 's family issued a statement saying the family would now be able to grieve properly as a result of the verdict			2
they described the last three years as a ' waking nightmare ' and described @entity6 as a ' disgusting individual '			0
they also questioned why ms @entity10 was ever prosecuted in the first place			0
her brother , @entity191 , speaking on behalf of the family said the police decision to prosecute her was ' shocking ' at a time when she should have been left to grieve for @entity10			0
outside court , ms @entity10 's stepfather @entity195 said he was pleased @entity6 , who he described as a ‘ scumbag ’ , would be off the streets away from women and children			1
he said : ‘ we have been dealt a life sentence which will never go away			0
' on @entity6 's protestations of innocence , mr @entity195 added : ‘ if he had have been half a man he would have gone into the court and told the jury ( the truth ) and did n't leave everything unanswered			2

@entity6 was jailed for life for the murder of @entity10
the toddler suffered a *catalogue* of injuries including 21 broken ribs and the head injury that killed her
