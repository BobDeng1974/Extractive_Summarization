by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 deputy governor @entity2 suggested that interest rates will rise from a record low of 0.5 per cent to ' settle ' at 3 per cent between 2017 and 2019 millions of homeowners are facing a jump in mortgage repayments after a senior @entity9 official warned interest rates could rise to 3 per cent in three years			1
deputy governor @entity2 suggested that interest rates will rise from a record low of 0.5 per cent and will ‘ settle ’ at 3 per cent between 2017 and 2019			1
last night experts said this could add more than £ 200 to the monthly cost of a typical mortgage of £ 150,000			0
news of the likely rise will add to fears that a generation of homeowners could soon struggle to afford their monthly repayments			0
only last week a report warned 2.3million homeowners in the @entity23 would become ‘ prisoners ’ to their home loans if there was even a modest rise in interest rates			2
the @entity9 has assured households that a hike in interest rates is not imminent , saying that any increase will be gradual			1
and governor @entity32 has indicated that the rate will not start rising before next @entity34			0
but speaking to @entity35 ’s @entity36 , mr @entity2 pressed the case for taking these small steps sooner rather than later			1
he said : ‘ the bank rate averaged about 5 per cent in the decade or so before the crisis			0
‘ it ’s reasonable to think that given the headwinds that are still out there as well as some of the global forces that the level we go to three or five years out might be a couple of percentage points below that			0
’ mr @entity2 went on to say that there was a case for moving in ‘ baby steps ’ to avoid making mistakes as ‘ we wo n’t be certain about the impact of tightening the bank rate ’			1
but he added : ‘ if you want to pursue that strategy you need to start taking baby steps a bit earlier , otherwise you end up being behind the curve			1
’ interest rates have been frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent since march 2009 , providing a boost to homeowners but misery for savers			2
rapid improvements in the economy , including a sharp drop in unemployment , have increased pressure on the @entity9 to raise rates			2
this image shows how the base rate has changed over the last decade , shown in blue , and what the @entity9 estimates it might steadily rise to until 2019 , shown in red last month mr @entity32 said they may remain low ‘ for some time ’ but added that the economy has ‘ edged closer ’ to the point where interest rates would need to rise			1
however the @entity85 think - tank has warned that millions could become ‘ prisoners ’ to their home loans if rates rise			1
in a report , they said that 2.3million people would be expected to fall behind with payments – with one in ten householders at risk of struggling financially or even losing their homes as a result			0
the research also predicted that an increasing number of people will be unable to switch to better deals as rates rise			2
and fears are mounting over what impact even a small increase will have on borrowers who have got used to record low mortgage costs			0
@entity108 , from mortgage broker @entity109 and @entity111 , said : ‘ over the last five years some households will have become complacent about how low interest rates have been			0
‘ it ’s now all about preparing for when they do climb , either by fixing your mortgage or by choosing to pay down your debt as quickly as possible			0

deputy governor @entity2 warned rates will rise from low of 0.5 per cent
he said the bank were taking ' baby steps ' to avoid making *big* mistakes
@entity9 had assured households the hike would not be imminent
