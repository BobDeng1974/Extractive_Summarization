by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 16:57 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 04:26 est , 14 august 2013 public - spirited : former nurse @entity3 left her fortune to the government to spend ' as they may think fit ' the @entity6 and @entity7 stood accused of ‘ robbery ’ yesterday after pocketing a £ 520,000 bequest to the nation left in an elderly spinster ’s will			1
when she died aged 90 , former nurse @entity3 left her fortune to the government to spend ‘ as they may think fit ’			1
but instead of using the money on the @entity16 , schools or to ease the national debt , the @entity14 shared it between them as a party donation			1
party spin doctors were accused of misleading journalists by insisting miss @entity3 had bequeathed the money to ‘ whichever party ’ was in power when she died			1
but their claim unravelled spectacularly when the @entity28 tracked down a copy of the will – which made no mention of any party			2
last night the @entity6 and @entity7 faced demands to repay the cash			0
they were also struggling to explain how a gift intended for the public good from an ‘ intelligent ’ , church - going woman with ‘ little interest in politics ’ had ended up in their coffers in the first place			2
it is not uncommon for people to leave a bequest to the nation			0
in 2010 - 11 , members of the public gave more than £ 1million to the government specifically as a gift to the nation , almost all of it left in wills			1
executors of the estates write a cheque made out to ‘ @entity57 ’ and it goes into the country ’s coffers			0
by contrast , bequests to political parties usually involve a specific clause in a will			0
@entity65 , former chairman of the @entity66 , added : ‘ i am surprised they were so desperate that they took the money in the first place			2
‘ i am surprised that a political party would want to take this money in circumstances when there is any doubt of the deceased person ’s intention			1
‘ if they are in any doubt , they should take legal advice and consider giving the money back to the estate			2
’ generous : miss @entity3 left her entire £ 520,000 estate to the government home : miss @entity3 had lived in the same three - bedroom semi-detached council house ( pictured ) since 1931 , when she moved in with her parents unions continue to account for the bulk of big donations to the @entity91			1
the @entity93 union , which went to war with @entity95 over plans to curb union influence , gave £ 722,195 from april to june this year			0
new figures reveal that even the @entity7 have raised more from individual non-union donors than the @entity91 since the election			0
unions have tightened their grip on @entity91 and are now responsible for three - quarters of all big donations to party coffers			2
the @entity93 union , which went to war with @entity95 over plans to curb union influence , gave £ 722,195 from april to june this year			0
new figures reveal that even the @entity7 have raised more from individual non-union donors than the @entity91 since the election			0
@entity110 chairman @entity109 said : ‘ despite @entity95 ’s promise of change , these independent figures prove his @entity91 is still dominated by the trade unions			0
‘ they choose the candidates , pick the leader and remain @entity91 ’s biggest donors - providing three quarters of the party 's money			1
' @entity122 , from the pressure group @entity123 which campaigns against @entity125 cuts , said : ‘ how far different is what they have done to stealing off an old lady ? ‘ we have a massive crisis in emergency services , thousands of @entity125 jobs are being squeezed out – and they decide to spend it on their party rather than services for the public			1
’ the donation came to light when the @entity141 issued a quarterly update yesterday on the funding of the political parties			2
it revealed that the conservatives and @entity7 had shared a £ 520,000 donation from a ‘ @entity147 ’ , who died last year			1
the fact that the @entity6 and @entity7 share power caused some confusion , but the sum was eventually divided between them based on the number of ministers and @entity156 , with the @entity110 taking a £ 420,000 slice of the pie			2
yesterday morning spin doctors from both parties insisted miss @entity3 had wanted them to have her money			1
a @entity110 source briefed : ‘ this money was donated out of the blue			2
it was a bequest to the party of the government of the day			1
’ but what miss @entity3 had actually stipulated in her will was that all the proceeds of her estate were to be paid to ‘ whichever government is in office at the date of my death for the government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit ’			1
somewhere along the line , somebody decided what she meant by this was for her hard - earned cash to fund the @entity110 ’ and @entity7 ’ campaigns to win the next election			0
friends of miss @entity3 – a churchgoer whose career as a nurse included spells as a midwife and a school ‘ nit nurse ’ – suggested this was the last thing she would have wanted			1
next - door neighbour @entity195 said : ‘ i would think she would have wanted the government to do something good with her money , something to do with looking after children like she did			1
‘ she never talked about politics			0
she would n’t dream of saying who she voted for			0
she was old - fashioned that way			0
’ miss @entity195 , 47 , added : ‘ she delivered hundreds of babies in her career			0
she was the best neighbour you could ever wish for			0
she was a very private woman , and very polite			0
’ born in @entity207 in 1921 , miss @entity3 never married and died there on september 22 last year , after a fall			1
' we have a massive crisis in emergency services , thousands of @entity125 jobs are being squeezed out - and they decide to spend it on their party rather than services for the public ' - @entity122 , from @entity123 she had lived in the same three - bedroom semi-detached council house since 1931 , when she moved in with her parents			1
she was described by neighbours as frugal , with little interest in fashion or luxuries , and ‘ highly intelligent ’			1
she refused to have central heating installed , but eventually relented over double glazing			0
another friend , @entity227 , said she thought miss @entity3 had been a conservative , and had made her money buying and selling shares			1
when she wrote her will in 2001 , @entity91 were in power , having just won their second term in a landslide victory			2
mrs @entity227 added : ‘ she was a “ @entity235 ” lady			0
very old - fashioned and very polite			0
’ the public - spirited miss @entity3 is even understood to have refused the offer to buy her £ 160,000 council house when it was offered to her and her elderly mother for just £ 2,000			1
' surprised ' : @entity65 , former chairman of the @entity66 , said he was ' surprised they were so desperate that they took the money in the first place ' @entity91 mp @entity110 ( left ) said it did not look like miss @entity3 intended the money ' for party political purposes '			1
meanwhile , @entity247 leader @entity246 ( right ) said miss @entity3 would have made it ' clear ' if she had wanted to fund a political party last night @entity91 mp @entity110 said : ‘ it certainly sounds that this was a generous gesture for the benefit of nation , and does n’t look like she intended it for party political purposes			1
‘ to suggest it should go to the party coffers of parties in power seems a perverse judgment			1
’ @entity247 leader @entity246 said : ‘ if she had wanted to fund a political party itself , she would have made that clear and probably backed a particular one			1
‘ at least , for the first time , the @entity14 agreed on something – shame it took half a million quid to bait them into consensus			1
’ ' i would think she would have wanted the government to do something good with her money , something to do with looking after children like she did ' - next - door neighbour @entity195 last night the blame game was in full swing			1
@entity110 and @entity7 sources claimed the executors of @entity281 ’ will , two @entity283 solicitors , initially contacted the government ’s @entity285 department to ask where to send the cash , and that both the @entity285 and the office of attorney general @entity290 – a @entity110 mp – then ruled it was a ‘ party political donation ’			1
this was flatly contradicted by the attorney general ’s office , which said : ‘ the executors of miss @entity3 ’s estate contacted the ago about her bequest but the attorney provided no advice			2
‘ @entity299 replied on behalf of the attorney general ’s office setting out further steps the executors may wish to take to identify the correct recipient of the bequest			0
‘ it did not , nor could have , advised to whom the bequest should go			0
’ a @entity110 party spokesman said : ‘ the solicitors for the deceased , acting as the executors , informed the @entity110 that it was a beneficiary of the will			2
’ a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity7 were notified that the party was a beneficiary of miss @entity3 ’s will			1
’ @entity316 : @entity317 , founder of the @entity318 , gave £ 65,000 to the @entity7 in the weeks before being made a peer @entity321 's party received a total of £ 4,116,006 , including major donations from businessmen			2
the largest gifts to the @entity110 were £ 280,770 from co-treasurer and hedge fund boss @entity327 and £ 263,600 from investment banker @entity328			0
@entity91 said the @entity6 received £ 1,042,970.93 in the last quarter from donors who attended private dinners with mr @entity321 and other senior ministers			0
it included £ 694,370 from donors in the financial sector			0
@entity335 mp , @entity91 ’s shadow justice secretary , said : ' the @entity6 have raked in over £ 1 million from private dinners with @entity321 and senior ministers in the last quarter			0
' and more than two thirds of that comes from the @entity341 – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes @entity321 cut			0
' hardworking families are seeing their living standards squeezed , with prices rising faster than wages			0
meanwhile @entity321 shows how out of touch he is , standing up for the millionaires who fund his party			2
' meanwhile , the new figures show the @entity318 gave £ 65,000 to the @entity7 , just weeks before the nightclub 's boss @entity317 received a peerage from @entity356			0
the superclub firm made a donation of £ 50,000 to the central party on june 6 , and on june 30 a further £ 15,000 was given to the @entity361 and @entity362 local association of @entity7 deputy leader @entity363 .			2
