is it really only a month since @entity1 headed into the last international break looking every inch a dead man walking , castigated by @entity6 fans campaigning for owner @entity7 to axe their manager ? at @entity9 on sunday , two minutes from the end of his fourth consecutive @entity12 win — and fifth in all competitions — @entity1 gazed up into the directors ’ box looking for @entity7 and gave him an emphatic thumbs up			1
‘ you can imagine everyone was pulling at him when we were n’t winning and he stuck with me and was very supportive , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ you have to have that as a manager			2
you ’ve got to have faith that you ’re doing the right things			1
@entity6 manager @entity1 makes notes during the clash against @entity28 @entity6 have managed five straight victories including wins against @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 @entity34 opened the scoring for @entity6 just before half - time with an audacious flick past @entity38 @entity40 powers a header past @entity38 after breaking free from @entity28 defender @entity42 ‘ i ’d like to think that buys you a bit of time			1
it bought me just enough time on this occasion			2
’ the last time @entity1 won five games in a row , @entity6 finished fifth in the @entity12 and he won the @entity51 in 2012			1
while that might be too much to ask this season , they are up to eighth place following a quite spectacular transformation			2
it has been built on the back of stubborn defence — @entity1 ’s side have not conceded in the last 342 minutes — and the emergence of a new @entity62 hero in @entity34			1
the @entity63 had already repaid the modest £ 1.5million transfer fee @entity6 spent to take him from @entity65 to @entity66 in the summer by scoring the winning goals on his previous two appearances against @entity31 and @entity33			1
@entity6 celebrate in front of the away fans at the @entity72 after @entity40 's header doubled their lead @entity75 leads the celebrations as @entity6 go 2 - 0 up after a @entity40 header after 60 minutes yesterday he conjured up a quite sublime finish to set his team on the road to another victory over @entity28			1
a disappointing first half was petering to a close when @entity6 moved the ball out to the right and @entity86 picked out @entity34 ’s run with a low ball into the box			1
the youngster still had plenty of work to do and he produced a fantastic piece of skill , flicking the ball with the inside of his trailing right foot across @entity38 and into the far corner			0
‘ that goal was worthy of winning any game , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ the cross was good but he had to add a little bit of pace with the flick and that ’s outstanding			0
‘ we worked hard to bring him to the club			0
‘ he was courted by some big clubs , in particular @entity109 , but he genuinely loved the way we were so determined to bring him and 54,000 @entity6 every week is a big magnet			1
’ @entity40 claimed the second goal just after the hour mark			0
@entity28 failed to clear a corner and the ball was once again played to @entity86 on the right			0
the full back took @entity118 one way and then twisted back inside before curling a fantastic cross to the edge of the six - yard box where @entity40 was waiting to power a downward header inside the near post			0
the @entity6 players bow their heads as they observe a minute 's silence before sunday 's victory players from both teams respect a @entity132 silence prior to kick - off in their @entity12 match after winning just once in 15 @entity12 games before the last international break , @entity1 can go into this one satisfied that he is beginning to win over at least some of his harshest critics			1
‘ @entity6 supporters are an extreme of any fan , ’ he said			1
‘ when they win , they go mad and when they lose , they go mad , too			0
we were n’t winning games and that is my job , to win games			2
‘ i am not going to get carried away			0
‘ these young players have a lot to learn but so far so good			0
’ for @entity28 boss @entity152 , however , this was a depressing step backwards after taking five points from his last three games			2
there was a significant lack of threat from his team despite enjoying plenty of possession and their best chance fell to @entity164 11 minutes from time when the full - back miscued horribly wide			0
@entity152 wondered whether @entity169 ’s first @entity168 call - up last week might have somehow contributed to a strangely subdued performance from his top @entity171 , who was being watched by @entity174 representative @entity173 , had an early shot turned over by @entity176 but rarely tested the @entity6 keeper after that			2
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity152 hold @entity132 wreaths prior to sunday 's match at the @entity72 ‘ he probably had his poorest game , ’ said @entity152			2
‘ people will ask the question , including myself , if it ’s a result of what has happened during the week but you can have a poor game at any time			0
‘ i would like to think @entity168 has given him a massive boost and today just did n’t happen for whatever reason			0
‘ the only pressure on @entity169 is to perform at his best level as often as he possibly can , but we need goals to come from all over the team			0
‘ we just did not play well enough			0

@entity6 boss @entity1 has masterminded @entity198 *turnaround*
@entity6 have now won each of their last five games on the bounce
@entity1 claims ' you ’ve got to have faith that you ’re doing the right things '
