scientists were amazed at the array of artefacts found within the 2,200 - year - old necropolis as it had already been raided by grave - robbers			1
the warrior was buried wearing chain - mail , while two swords and a pair of bronze helmets were also found			1
golden grave : the warrior 's grave , located near the town of @entity20 in the @entity21 , @entity6 , included a gold brooch , measuring a little over 2in by 2in , with a rock crystal fixed in its centre collection : scientists who found the necropolis discovered more than 12 gold artefacts , as well as a number of weapons one of the helmets was inscribed with curled sheep horns , while a 36in sword was found resting between his legs			1
scientists believe the warrior , whose grave was located near the town of @entity20 in the @entity21 , was a ' chief of a people ' , rather than the head of a town or city			1
chief : an axe belonging to the warrior , who researchers said was most likely the ' chief of a people ' rather than the head of a town animal remains were also found in the grave , including three horses , a cow and a wild boar skull			1
@entity54 , a researcher at the @entity55 , said that the animals ' were particularly valuable among barbarian peoples of the ancient world '			0
he told the @entity60 : ' it was [ a ] sign of [ the ] great importance of the buried person , which was shown by his relatives and his tribe			0
' bones of other animals and pottery also found in the grave , suggest that a feast was held to mark the warrior 's death			2
writing in the journal @entity77 from @entity78 to @entity79 , the team behind the discovery detailed the 12 gold artefacts discovered			2
the find included a gold brooch , measuring 2.3 by 1.9 inches , with a rock crystal fixed in its centre			0
the two swords also included gold decorations , something the scientists had never come across before			2
a smaller 19 - inch sword featured a gold plate , leading the team to note ' actual fact that these articles were used to decorate weapons sets them apart in a category all of their own , which has so far not been recorded anywhere else '			0
grave robbers first discovered the necropolis in 2004 , a year before excavations began at the site			0
the researchers believe the grave was used between the third century @entity104 and the beginning of the second century @entity106 , but they could not link the artefacts with any particular culture			0
