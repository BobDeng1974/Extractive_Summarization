@entity1 's @entity0 had to settle for 14th place in an incident - packed @entity3 as @entity6 @entity5 took victory in a sprint finish with @entity10 's @entity9			1
with @entity12 and @entity14 - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury , @entity0 was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in @entity20 and third - place finish at the @entity23 sprint classic			1
he was in contention for much of sunday 's race as @entity1 set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods , but the @entity29 was unable to recover ground as @entity5 ( @entity31 ) and @entity9 ( @entity33 - @entity32 ) launched a late breakaway			1
@entity5 celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the @entity3 @entity6 's @entity5 poses after beating off competition from @entity9 to win the tour of @entity39 race the highly - fancied @entity5 came home in a time of six hours , 26 minutes and 38 seconds , with @entity9 just behind and local hope @entity42 of @entity44 ( @entity45 ) seven seconds back in third			1
@entity0 , looking to become only the second @entity46 to win the event after @entity48 in 1961 , finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back			2
it was not to be for @entity1 , who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling 's big five classic one - day races - and one that was not short of incident			0
sir @entity58 , in one of his last rides for @entity1 , was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left - hand turn			0
@entity1 's @entity0 finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of @entity5 although he needed a spare bike , @entity72 was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with @entity76 @entity75 - who was part of a seven - man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him			2
incredibly , there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw @entity88 also knocked off his bike and out of the race			0
the @entity91 was hit by his team car after it had been rear - ended by another vehicle			0
other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate , leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride			0
the late drama was created by @entity5 and @entity9 , though			2
they escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and , with no one able to catch them , it was down to one of them to take the crown			0
@entity9 bided his time on the final straight as he sat on @entity5 's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack , but when he did the @entity6 reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second ' @entity120 ' title after his @entity122 triumph in 2014 .			1
