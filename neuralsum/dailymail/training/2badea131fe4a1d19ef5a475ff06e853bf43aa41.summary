she says that the @entity9 feminine mystique , ' nonchalant , subtle , confident , funny and charismatic ' , is in fact a carefully constructed fiction			2
their supposed natural beauty , for example , is all down to an intense , yet covert , regime			2
@entity29 says @entity9 women would ' rather die than reveal their beauty secrets '			1
they scour hairdressers for the best colourist to give them a ' natural ' looking blonde , and invest in super strong anti-wrinkle creams from the age of 25			1
actress @entity26 ( l ) and star of @entity54 , @entity55 ( r ) , epitomise @entity9 chic they may never talk about dieting , but that does n't mean they do n't watch what they eat			2

almost half smoke cigarettes , known to suppress the appetite , according to a recent report			0
we might imagine they possess lingerie drawers full of silk and lace - but in fact , a recent report from the @entity76 shows in 2012 the average @entity9 woman spends just £ 100 on underwear			1
this is a fifth of what the average @entity14 shells out			0
it was also revealed the @entity9 buy mostly cotton bras and knickers , rather than investing in luxury materials			2

finally , the famed @entity9 chic is not quite as effortless as it appears			2
@entity29 says a @entity9 woman will fight ' like a lioness to understand trends and how to display them			1
no innate style on the horizon '			0
the thought - provoking research shines a new light of the @entity9 way of life			1
according to the @entity8 , the secret is ' to do everything falsely : [ they are ] falsely coiffed , falsely dressed			0
' @entity105 the grandmaman of ‘ learn from the @entity9 ’ books , this purports to unlock the key to how , despite eating mounds of cheese and fois gras , @entity9 women retain their figures			1
author @entity17 claims that while they do n’t forbid themselves anything , they eat it in moderation			0
rather than obsessing about diets , they take pleasure in staying slim while eating well			0
@entity123 ... is the importance of understanding ‘ the brevity of time and the immediacy of pleasure ’ , writes @entity126			0

@entity135 and slim never mind diet , it ’s undies that ’s are key to @entity9 women ’s figures , according to @entity142			1
‘ even @entity9 women ’s lingerie helps to keep them slim , ’ @entity142 writes			1
