visit : according to prime minister @entity69 , who visited the region last week , the area has not been dredged since the late 1990s , and this had made it more prone to flooding ‘ we recognise that we should have dredged and i think it is important now that we get on the process of getting those people back into their houses once we are able to really do some serious pumping			0
’ mr @entity120 has criticised under - fire agency chairman @entity92 for refusing to say sorry for the failures when he was besieged by angry locals on visit to the area			2

' the @entity1 is bound by the rules that are laid down by the government			0
