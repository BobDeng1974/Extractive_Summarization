putting your feet up while pregnant could be harmful for both mother and baby , say scientists			0
experts have warned that bed rest during pregnancy has few benefits – and can lead to depression , muscle loss , and a greater risk of blood clots and diabetes			1
it could also result in babies having a lower weight at birth			2
bed rest could put expectant mothers at risk of muscle and bone loss , diabetes , depression and blood clots , experts have warned issuing key guidelines , the @entity25 in @entity26 said that around one in five women in the @entity26 is put on bed rest during pregnancy , often as a result of complications			1
however , it said , it no longer recommends routinely limiting physical activity			0
co-author @entity36 , of the @entity37 and @entity38 , said : ‘ there is no evidence bed rest improves outcomes			2
‘ however there is evidence bed rest can be harmful for moms , babies and families			2
’ surveys show that obstetricians and gynaecologists often prescribe bed rest even though most do not believe it will do much to improve outcomes for women			2
it is prescribed for a variety of complications ranging from premature contractions or early labour to high blood pressure , potentially fatal pre-eclampsia , inadequate growth of the baby and for women who are at high risk of miscarriage			0
but the @entity25 said bed rest has not been shown to reduce the chance of a premature delivery , either for women who are thought to be at risk or for those already in early labour			1
one study found premature birth actually became more common when at - risk women were placed on any type of activity restriction – either at home or in hospital			0
there is little data to show activity restriction is of benefit for any condition linked to pregnancy , dr @entity36 said			0
for example , bed rest is often prescribed in an attempt to increase the blood flow to the placenta when the baby is not growing fast enough			1
the @entity25 in the @entity26 has also warned periods of inactivity in pregnancy could also lead to lower birth weight in babies but studies fail to show any benefit to this practice			1
at the same time , there are several potentially harmful side effects of bed rest			2
it is widely known that doing too little activity can result in muscle and bone loss			0
this ‘ deconditioning ’ can start after only a few days and there is a lack of information on its effect on pregnant women			0
bed rest may also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs – and raise the chance that clots will move to the lungs , which can be fatal			1
such clots are more common among pregnant women , so limiting physical activity may compound these risks			0
lack of movement may also increase a woman ’s risk of gestational diabetes			0
the @entity25 said that being admitted to hospital for problems during pregnancy has been associated with a higher chance of this condition			0
it pointed to studies which have shown that patients who are put on bed rest when not pregnant tend to develop high blood sugar levels , a key risk factor for diabetes			1
bed rest also increases the risk of anxiety and depression , perhaps because of the forced inactivity			1
it can lead to loss of income due to inability to work and has been linked to having a baby with a lower birth weight .			1

bed rest can increase an expectant mothers ' risk of blood clots , depression , diabetes and having babies with a lower birth weight
figures show around a fifth of pregnant mothers are told to put their feet up
but @entity25 in the @entity26 is warning against it
