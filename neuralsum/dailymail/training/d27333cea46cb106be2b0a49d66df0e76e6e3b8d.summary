by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:44 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 19:29 est , 12 april 2012 @entity3 etched on her face , a woman clings desperately to the sheer rockface as waves crash around her feet			1
cut off by the incoming tide and left with no option but to try to scramble up the cliff , she screams for help to other holidaymakers on the beach			1
luckily her cries were heard by the coastguard , who raised the alarm as the rising water threatened to engulf her			1
the group , from @entity40 , @entity41 , had been cut off by the tide between @entity43 and @entity44 in @entity45 on @entity23			0
coastguard @entity28 said of the dramatic rescue : ' i could hear her screams so i called @entity29 and asked for a launch of [ rescue helicopter ] 193 @entity53 immediately			1
' she was screaming for help and was only about a foot off the water with waves breaking above her			2
' from the minute @entity53 were called to when they got there , if she had fallen into the water it could have been very serious			2
' the rescue involved @entity64 , @entity65 and a @entity66 from @entity53			1
but the rescue was almost replicated the next day when four more holidaymakers were again caught out on the cliffs , just before 3pm			2
@entity3 : miss @entity21 's hysterical screams could be heard hundreds of metres away as she clung to the cliff by her fingernails , with waves crashing over her head @entity75 and @entity76 , from @entity77 and @entity78 respectively , and @entity79 , from @entity80 , were all winched to safety by the @entity53 helicopter after becoming trapped by the incoming tide			1
mr and @entity85 had become stuck on the same section of cliff as @entity21 the day before and were joined by coastguard station manager mr @entity28 as they waited for help			2
the fourth holidaymaker , londoner @entity90 , had slipped and fallen into the sea but scrambled to @entity43 for safety			0
she was rescued by the @entity65 and taken to @entity44 where the other three were recovering			1
@entity90 and @entity79 were later taken to @entity93 as both were suffering symptoms of hypothermia			0
the incidents came as the coast was battered by @entity100 tides , which are some of the strongest of the year			0
not technically linked to the season , @entity100 tides occur when the @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 are all in a line			0
mr @entity28 added : ' people were not aware of the state of the tides and clearly did not realise how quickly it comes in and cuts off exits			0
' these incidents could have had a fatal outcome if it was not for the rapid response of the emergency services			0
' people need to be aware of the state of the tides at all times , especially if there are no lifeguards on duty			0
' these were just some of a number of incidents across @entity45 attended by emergency services over the weekend			0
in the most serious , 60 - year - old @entity124 lost his life while attempting to rescue his 27 - year - old son , @entity126 , who was later saved by @entity127 , after he was swept off rocks at @entity129 , near @entity130 , on sunday			2
@entity65 video shows the rescue as it happened			1

screams were heard hundreds of metres away as water crashed over her head
winched off *perilous* cliff face by @entity34 rescue helicopter
boyfriend and two others were rescued by an @entity65 lifeboat just moments earlier
