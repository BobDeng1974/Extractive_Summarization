by @entity0 newspaper reports based on top - secret documents about @entity5 and @entity6 electronic surveillance could have helped terrorists evade monitoring and capture , a former foreign secretary said yesterday			1
sir @entity10 , the chairman of the @entity11 , warned stories about @entity5 ’s electronic snooping capability – leaked by rogue @entity15 technician @entity14 - might have enabled terrorists to avoid detection			1
the former defence and foreign secretary also defended @entity21 ’s efforts to have @entity23 newspaper - which published many of mr @entity14 ’s revelations - destroy the classified documents held on computers in its offices			2
controversy : the @entity23 's computer components , including the motherboard and solid - state hard drive destroyed in the interests of national security row : @entity37 asked cabinet secretary sir @entity38 to contact the @entity23 about the classified material handed over by @entity14 , which led to the destruction of hard drives home secretary @entity42 said the police were right to detain @entity44 ( left ) , the partner of @entity46 ( right ) , who was carrying secret intelligence files leaked by @entity48 analyst @entity14 it has been confirmed that @entity42 ( pictured ) knew that mr @entity44 would be detained he said the documents were ‘ top secret ’ and the intelligence and security agencies rightly wanted them destroyed			1
yesterday , @entity54 confirmed he backed the decision to go after the documents - but refused to endorse the detention of @entity44 , the partner of the @entity23 journalist @entity46 who wrote the stories based on @entity14 ’s stolen documents			2
mr @entity44 ’s detention for nine hours at @entity61 sparked a major row this week with civil liberties groups and @entity65 backbenchers accusing the police of abusing counter-terrorism powers			1
the 28 - year - old was reportedly carrying some of the top secret documents when he was stopped while changing planes on route from @entity72 to @entity73 where he lives with mr @entity46			0
police also seized his hard drives and other electronic equipment			2
home secretary @entity42 has defended the detention , saying the police acted in the interests of national security			1
mr @entity44 ( pictured left with mr @entity46 at a @entity82 airport ) was questioned for nine hours by police a statement released by mr @entity54 ’s office said : ‘ we understand the concerns about recent events , particularly around issues of @entity90 and civil liberties			1
’ it said the @entity65 leader will ‘ wait and see ’ the findings of a review of the case to be carried out by a terror powers watchdog , @entity97			0
speaking on the today programme , sir @entity100 , a former defence and foreign secretary directly challenged repeated claims by the @entity104 that the documents held by the @entity23 were destroyed to avoid ‘ embarrassment ’ to @entity107 he said it was ‘ not a question of embarrassment to the government ’ - but ‘ something potentially relevant to terrorism ’			1
he said : ‘ there ’s no question that the various press reports of some of the @entity14 leaks - what @entity14 has given to various newspapers in the @entity6 and the @entity5 - gave information about the way in which the intelligence agencies are able to access emails or telephone calls by people who they suspect are terrorists - procedures that are much more sophisticated than perhaps terrorists understood			0
‘ and terrorists , some of whom are very smart people , will have picked up that information and will have responded accordingly , and potentially made it more difficult if they have access to that information			0
’ he said @entity23 ’s editor @entity134 was not in a position to judge whether the release of ‘ top secret information ’ could have ‘ significant relevance in the battle against terrorism ’			1
yesterday , the @entity141 revealed that senior @entity21 mandarin @entity38 contacted @entity23 seeking to destroy documents it held on its server from the @entity14 cache			2
after two months of negotiations , hard disk drives were smashed in the basement of the @entity23 ’s building			0
sir @entity100 added : ‘ i think mr @entity134 and the article he wrote yesterday about the destruction of his hard disc is on relatively weak ground			1
‘ he clearly did not dispute that he had no legal right to possess the files or the documents that were being discussed			0
former @entity15 and @entity157 worker @entity14 has been given temporary asylum in @entity159 ‘ clearly if he thought that what he was doing was perfectly lawful that he was perfectly entitled to have these documents he would have told the cabinet secretary to “ get lost ”			0
‘ as far as the security agencies were concerned , he said , ‘ there was a top secret document , which the @entity23 had in its possession			0
they wanted that back or they wanted it destroyed			0
’ on the destruction of the hard disks , mrs may told @entity173 ’s @entity174 : ‘ if @entity107 believes information that could be of help to terrorists is potentially being held insecurely , could fall into the wrong hands , i think it is right the government should act			0
‘ i do n’t find it strange that should be done at a senior level			0
’ mr @entity14 who worked for the @entity15 and the @entity157 , has been granted temporary asylum by @entity159 after the @entity6 charged him with espionage			2
he stole a raft of top secret @entity6 government documents on the activities of the @entity157 before leaking them to the @entity23 and @entity6 newspapers .			1

@entity191 asked sir @entity38 to warn paper against publishing material
@entity195 later went to @entity23 's office and helped staff smash hard drives
@entity200 say it is ' difficult to imagine ' @entity6 government taking that action
it also emerged mr @entity37 knew in advance @entity44 would be held
home secretary @entity42 said police acting in national security interests
@entity10 says @entity23 editor @entity134 on ' weak ground '
' he did not dispute that he had no legal right to possess the files , ' he said
@entity44 , who was carrying secret @entity15 files , was held for nine hours
@entity82 has said he is *launching* legal action against the @entity218
@entity220 , who helped bring in @entity221 , *slams* decision
' i *'m* very clear that this does not apply to mr @entity44 , ' @entity227 peer said
