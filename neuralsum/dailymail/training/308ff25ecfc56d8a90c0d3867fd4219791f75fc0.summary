most people do n't give a second thought when tucking into a plate of salad			0
but perhaps we should be a bit more considerate when chomping on lettuce , as scientists have found that plants actually respond defensively to the sounds of themselves being eaten			1
the researchers at the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) found that plants can identify sounds nearby , such as the sound of eating , and then react to the threats in their environment			1
here a cabbage butterfly caterpillar feeds on an @entity24 plant with a piece of reflective tape helping to record vibrations ' previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy , including music , ' said @entity31 , senior research scientist in the @entity32 in the @entity33 and the @entity34 at @entity11			1
researchers in @entity36 , @entity37 , found plants give off a gas when under ' attack '			1
super-sensitive microphones picked up a ' bubbling ' sound from a healthy plant			0
but this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat			0
even a tiny insect bite could have an effect			0
' the more a plant is subjected to stress , the louder the signal , ' said dr @entity52			0
plants do not actually scream in pain			0
but different sounds are heard when the gas they emit , ethylene , is bombarded with lasers			1
the research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer , as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound			0
it could then be separated from the fresher ones			0
' however , our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration			1
' we found that " feeding vibrations " signal changes in the plant cells ' metabolism , creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars			1
' @entity31 collaborated with @entity80 , professor in the @entity81 at @entity11			2
in the study , caterpillars were placed on @entity24 , a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard			2
using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant , @entity80 was able to measure the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar			0
@entity80 and @entity31 then played back recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations to one set of plants , but played back only silence to the other set of plants			2
when caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants , the researchers found that the plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils , a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars			1
' what is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations , including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defenses , ' @entity80 said			1
' this indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration			0
' @entity31 ( left ) and @entity80 ( right ) from the @entity11 led the research			2
in the study , caterpillars were placed on a plant and , using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant , the team measured the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar @entity31 and @entity80 say future research will focus on how vibrations are sensed by the plants , what features of the complex vibrational signal are important , and how the mechanical vibrations interact with other forms of plant information to generate protective responses to pests			1
' plants have many ways to detect insect attack , but feeding vibrations are likely the fastest way for distant parts of the plant to perceive the attack and begin to increase their defenses , ' @entity80 said			2
' caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling away , so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could be useful to agriculture , ' @entity31 said			0
' this research also opens the window of plant behavior a little wider , showing that plants have many of the same responses to outside influences that animals do , even though the responses look different			0
' the study , ' plants respond to leaf vibrations caused by insect herbivore chewing , ' was funded in part by the @entity171 and was published in @entity172 .			1

researchers from the @entity11 found plants respond to attack
they discovered the sound of caterpillars eating made them more defensive
plants that heard caterpillar sounds released more mustard oils , which are unappealing to caterpillars and thus ward them off
but plants that heard the wind , despite having a similar acoustic sound , knew not to waste their defensive *capabilities*
this suggests plants are able to identify sounds in their environment
