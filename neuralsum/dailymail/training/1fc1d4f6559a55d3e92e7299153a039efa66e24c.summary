by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 06:17 est , 11 march 2013 a midwife who opened @entity3 's only clinic for victims of female genital mutilation has spoken in harrowing detail about the horrors inflicted upon her young patients			1
@entity10 , 50 , originally from @entity11 , opened the @entity12 at @entity14 's @entity13 in 1997 , and treats up to 350 women for ' reversal procedures ' each year , despite @entity6 being illegal in the @entity3 since 1985			1
' i have young people saying to me : " @entity20 , can you put my clitoris back ? " and they get angry when i tell them what has been removed ca n't be returned , ' @entity10 told the @entity25 on @entity26			1
@entity10 : 16 years after her @entity6 clinic opened communities are finally talking about it ' which is fantastic ' @entity6 is usually carried out on girls aged between five and 12 , and @entity10 says she performs surgery to reverse the closure of the vaginal opening on two women each week			1
the midwife says it is ' fantastic ' that communities are finally talking about the issue of @entity6 , a practice associated with religion and female oppression - and one actively encouraged by the victim 's mothers ' 90 per cent of the time '			1
within certain communities female circumcision is deemed necessary to make a girl marriageable , and is often carried out by a ' grandma ' who has no anatomical knowledge and sees it as ' an act of love ' rather than something barbaric , reported the @entity25			2
procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating , and later cysts , infections , infertility as well as complications in childbirth and an increased risk of newborn deaths			2
there are four types of fgm - clidoridectomy , excision , infibulation and other - and adult women who have undergone mutilation type three or four can have desperately painful intercourse , and suffer anxiety and palpitations when their husbands want sex			2
men can find it unpleasant , too , even suffering bruised penises			0
' some say to me it 's like trying to penetrate a brick wall , ' says @entity83			2
type one : @entity84 partial or total removal of the clitoris and , in very rare cases , only the prepuce ( the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris )			0
type two : excision partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora , with or without excision of the labia majora ( the lips that surround the vagina )			0
type three : @entity101 narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal			0
the seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the inner , or outer , labia , with or without removal of the clitoris			0
type four : other all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes , e.g. pricking , piercing , incising , scraping and cauterizing the genital area			0
pointless : ' no type of @entity6 has any health benefits , nor is it linked to religion ' ( picture posed by model ) source : @entity121 @entity10 has discovered that parents keen for their daughters to be circumcised take them on ' summer holidays ' to their ancestral homeland where they will be secretly cut			1
she is now campaigning for a police stall at @entity127 over the summer months , and wants carriers to help raise awareness of the law , ' but they think it 's too culturally sensitive '			2
while almost 30 @entity134 countries practice @entity6 and most of @entity10 's patients come from @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity11 , they are far from an anomaly			1
the @entity121 stresses @entity6 has no health benefits and is a violation of the human rights of girls and women in november , @entity149 journalist @entity148 reported witnessing 248 girls suffer mutilation in just one day ' of celebration ' in @entity153			1
@entity148 said : ' although @entity153 is not a country where @entity6 is widely reported , the practice is endemic			1
' two nationwide studies carried out by population researchers in 2003 and 2010 found that between 86 and 100 per cent of households surveyed subjected their daughters to genital cutting , usually before the age of five			0
' more than 90 per cent of adults said they wanted the practice to continue			0
' the @entity121 stresses @entity6 has no health benefits and is a violation of the human rights of girls and women			1
people who carry out or arrange female genital mutilation in the @entity3 or abroad face up to 14 years in prison			2
@entity170 : ' fgm targets fragile angels who are helpless , who can not fight back ' @entity175 supermodel @entity170 backed a film highlighting the plight of young girls facing female genital mutilation in the @entity3 , @entity174 reported in july 2011			1
she supported the project together with the @entity180 to highlight the potentially fatal practice			0
@entity170 , an @entity6 victim herself , said : ' female genital mutilation targets little girls , baby girls - fragile angels who are helpless , who can not fight back			1
' it 's a crime against a child , a crime against humanity			2
it 's absolutely criminal and we have to stop it			0
' a film , @entity192 , was produced by schoolgirls in @entity14 as a free download for schools in the @entity3			1
detective sergeant @entity196 , from the @entity180 , said : ' this is a hidden problem that affects thousands of children and young women in the @entity3			1
' there are no legitimate cultural or religious reasons for female genital mutilation - it 's child abuse			0
' the film was financed by the @entity180 , and the @entity206 , with the backing of the @entity208 and the @entity209			0
it was produced by @entity211 , which specialises in child safety			0
its president @entity213 said : ' this is a practice that needs bringing out into the open so that it can be addressed - by working with communities here to change minds			0
