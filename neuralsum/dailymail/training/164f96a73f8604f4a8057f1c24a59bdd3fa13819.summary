sergeant @entity3 , 38 , today pleaded not guilty at @entity4 in @entity5 to illegally possessing a @entity14 9mm pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition			1
he was convicted and sentenced to military detention last year for keeping the @entity19 pistol as a war trophy before having his sentence reduced and conviction subsequently quashed by @entity25 judges			1
at a preparatory hearing to discuss the future of the case today , judge advocate @entity26 said there was no abuse of process relating to content in emails apparently leaked by a @entity36 source , which were referred to for the first time at the hearing			1
he said : ‘ provided i am satisfied that there has been no bad faith or dishonesty and that the exercise of a prosecutorial discretion has been conscientiously undertaken , i should direct that the matter proceeds to trial			1
‘ i am so satisfied			2
there is no abuse of process and i dismiss the defendant ’s application to stay these proceedings			2
’ @entity54 ’s counsel , @entity53 , told the court about emails leaked by an @entity36 ‘ whistle - blower ’ which he said appeared to show the @entity59 consulting the military ‘ chain of command ’ - the @entity61 ’s office - on whether or not to pursue the case against the soldier			1
mr @entity53 said : ‘ there is an issue of disclosure			2
in theory the effect of this meeting is rather like the @entity71 saying to the head of the @entity73 : “ i ’m thinking of charging one of your officers , i ’d be interested in your views , thank you very much ”			2
’ family : sergeant @entity3 is pictured with his wife @entity6 and his children @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) however , prosecutors said there was nothing ‘ improper ’ with the conduct alleged in the email			1
counsel @entity92 told the court : ‘ if there was a basis , for a second , to think that the @entity59 said to the ag : “ tell me what you want me to do , i will roll over and go with the army ’s view ” , then there is something in my friend ’s point			2
’ but he said there was nothing in the evidence which suggested a breach of regulations			2
@entity54 , from the @entity111 regiment , appeared in court wearing full military uniform and answered ‘ not guilty ’ to two charges put to him today			1
the trial is expected to start on july 1			0
retrial : sergeant @entity3 is pictured ( left ) in his @entity2 sniper gear and ( right ) arriving at the court today his family said outside court that they were ‘ bitterly disappointed ’ with the judge ’s ruling			1
' @entity123 and the family have been amazing , strong , very robust			0
i think a lot of people would have crumbled ' sergeant @entity3 describing his court ordeal so far , the soldier said today : ‘ i would n't wish it on anyone 's family - it 's horrible			1
that 's not just for @entity6 , myself and the kids , it 's on the wider family			0
‘ thanks to everybody , the family who have come from around the world for this , thanks to the public and to the media who have been very supportive throughout			0
’ paying tribute to his partner , he added : ‘ without her , without @entity123 and the family , i would n't be here now			0
they 've been amazing , strong , very robust			0
i think a lot of people would have crumbled			0
’ couple : sergeant @entity3 said his wife @entity6 and family have been ' amazing , strong , very robust ' mrs @entity156 said : ‘ our lives are on hold completely			1
every day is consumed by this case , all our conversations with our friends and family are consumed by this case			0
we 've all struggled through it			0
’ ' our lives are on hold completely			0
every day is consumed by this case , all our conversations with our friends and family are consumed by this case ' @entity156 she said the financial pressures were being supported by a charitable organisation , which was helping raise money for their fight to clear the soldier 's name			0
she added : ‘ we want a fair trial and to feel @entity3 has been given a fair trial			1
we 're obviously bitterly disappointed today that we are going ahead with a re-trial now			0
‘ but in some respects there are still a lot of unanswered questions for us			0
@entity3 's pleaded not guilty today and we 're still looking for the right outcome			1
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
