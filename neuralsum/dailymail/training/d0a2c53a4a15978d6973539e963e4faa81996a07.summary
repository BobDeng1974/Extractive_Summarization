plumes of water vapour 100 miles high may have been spotted bursting out of the icy surface of @entity4 's @entity3			1
scientists believe they detected two vapour jets shooting into space for seven hours at a time			1
like ' @entity10 ' , the famous volcanic geyser in @entity12 , @entity13 , the plumes appear to erupt at regular intervals			0
this is an artist 's concept of a plume of water vapour thought to be ejected off the frigid , icy surface of the @entity20 , located about 500 million miles ( 800 million @entity21 from the sun but while @entity10 manages around 100 feet , @entity20 's vapour fountains are thought to reach heights of 124 miles - around 20 times higher than the peak of @entity26			1
if confirmed , the observations prove that water from the moon 's ice - covered ocean can easily reach the surface , which has important implications for future space missions			1
many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding @entity20 , warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by @entity4 's gravity , may have conditions favourable to life			1
this graphic shows the location of water vapour detected over @entity20 's south pole in observations taken by @entity46 's @entity45 in december 2012 @entity4 's icy moon europa is slightly smaller than the @entity49 's @entity48			1
@entity20 orbits @entity4 every 3.5 days and is phase locked -- just like @entity51 -- so that the same side of @entity3 faces @entity4 at all times			2
however , because @entity20 orbits in an oval , when it is close to @entity4 the tide is much higher			2
it is thought to have an iron core , a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water , like @entity49			2
unlike on @entity49 , however , this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of @entity20 , and being far from the sun , the ocean surface is globally frozen over			1
many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding @entity20 , warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by @entity4 's gravity , may have conditions favourable to life			1
scientists used images from the @entity45 to identify unusual ' spikes ' of hydrogen and oxygen in two distinct regions of the moon 's southern hemisphere			1
they were observed for just seven hours at a time when @entity79 was at the furthest point of its orbit away from @entity4 , vanishing as the moon got closer			2
the discovery suggests the presence of high jets of water vapour - water is made from hydrogen and oxygen - that may be triggered by tidal forces opening cracks in @entity3 's surface			1
the team led by dr @entity93 , from @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , wrote in the journal @entity98 : ' these emissions are persistently found in the same area over around seven hours			0
. they are consistent with two 200 kilometre - high plumes of water vapour			2
' similar plumes have previously been seen on one of @entity107 's moons , @entity108			0
details of the discovery were also presented at the @entity112 's autumn meeting in @entity113			0
scientists used images from the @entity45 to identify unusual ' spikes ' of hydrogen and oxygen in two distinct regions of the moon 's southern hemisphere as well as @entity45 , @entity46 â€™s @entity122 spacecraft is also currently providing scientists with key clues about @entity107 's moons			1
in particular it is looking at the @entity126 and its hydrocarbon seas			0
@entity126 is one of the most @entity49 - like places in the solar system , and the only place other than our planet that has stable liquid on its surface			0
@entity122 's recent close flybys are bringing into sharper focus a region in @entity126 's northern hemisphere that sparkles with almost all of the moon 's seas and lakes			1
scientists working with the spacecraft 's radar instrument have put together the most detailed multi-image mosaic of that region to date			2
the image includes all the seas and most of the major lakes			0
the images show that the seasare more extensive and complex than previously thought			0
they also show nearly all of the lakes on @entity126 fall into an area covering about 600 miles by 1,100 miles ( 900 km by 1,800 km )			0
only 3 per cent of the liquid at @entity126 falls outside of this area			0
' scientists have been wondering why @entity126 's lakes are where they are			0
these images show us that the bedrock and geology must be creating a particularly inviting environment for lakes in this box , ' said @entity167 , a @entity122 radar team member at the @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170 ' we think it may be something like the formation of the prehistoric lake called @entity175 near @entity176 in @entity177 and @entity178 , where deformation of the crust created fissures that could be filled up with liquid			0

scientists have detected two vapour jets appearing for up to seven hours
this proves that water from @entity20 's ocean can easily reach the surface
experts believe the moon 's ocean may have conditions that can support life
