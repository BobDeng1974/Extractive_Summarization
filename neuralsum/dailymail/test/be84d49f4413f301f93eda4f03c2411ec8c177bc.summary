historian @entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on the ' victim status ' of ethnic minorities and disabled people - and says women are only of average intelligence			1
the television presenter also gave his views on the current political class , claiming he did not believe any politician was equipped to be prime minister and the ' real talent has left politics '			1
the outspoken 70 - year - old said evidence suggested women tended to be of average intelligence , whereas men were either ' very , very bright or very thick ' , but denied he is sexist			1
he said : ' they espoused victimhood and violence			0
and i think to a dangerous extent that has happened in this country			0
with all the praise that 's been lavished on @entity26 , she 's constantly treating blacks as victims			0
' all forms of liberation , and i speak as gay and i was in all this when it was n't fashionable , when you did n't get your @entity52 for being a prominent poofter , when there were actual penalties for doing it - all of them depend upon you taking control			0
about you refusing to be a victim			0
@entity0 also hit out at @entity59 ( pictured ) , for following what he claimed was the approach of @entity31 civil rights leaders after @entity33 's death by ' treating blacks as victims ' ' and i find it very , very sad the sway there is now this perpetual procession of people - group after group - wanting to assume the status of victim			2
' @entity0 , who said he was ' born quite seriously disabled ' , added people with physical and mental disabilities should not be portrayed as victims			2
