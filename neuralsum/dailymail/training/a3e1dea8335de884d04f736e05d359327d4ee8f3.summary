by @entity0 picking up the dry cleaning can be such a tedious chore			1
but one enterprising businessman believes he has solved the problem , by delivering people 's freshly - cleaned clothes using a military - style aerial drone			1
@entity8 in @entity9 have started using a four - bladed @entity11 quadracopter to whisk orders over the city 's crowded streets direct to their customers ' front doors			1
it 's the middle of rush hour , the roads are jammed , a customer needs their favourite dress or suit for an evening engagement , and they need it fast			1
could a drone be the perfect answer ? @entity8 owner @entity23 admits that the service is only in its infancy and there is still a long way to go before it replaces the traditional methods of popping along in person to pick up your clothes			1
while the current drone is only able to carry a couple of pounds over a short distance , mr @entity23 is already planning an advanced model that can carry up to 10 pounds over a greater distance , according to @entity55			2
in the meantime he said he will hold a lottery at the end of each month with the winner getting their order flown to the door			2
it 's off : the radio - controlled drone whisks the item out of the dry cleaners shop and down the street all of as flutter : it carries the item along a residential street prompt delivery : the order arrives fresh and clean at the customer 's front door mr @entity23 told the @entity75 : ' it â€™s not just like all of a sudden we are going to change the whole dry cleaning service			2
it is more of a stepping stone			0
' aerial drones , also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or @entity84 , are normally used by the military or the police for spying or launching missile attacks on enemies			0
their use in war has become extremely controversial with drone strikes blamed for hundreds of civilian casualties			0
last month we reported how @entity95 's have developed a drone capable of delivering pizzas			0
the popular chain teamed up with an advertising agency to test the system delivering pizzas to its customers by flying them through the air and still keeps its cargo piping hot on arrival			0
soaring success : dominos have tested using a drone to deliver pizzas piping hot to a customer 's door			0
