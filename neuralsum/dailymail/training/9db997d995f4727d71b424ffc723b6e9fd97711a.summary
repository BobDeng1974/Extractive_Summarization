at @entity1 ’s brand new £ 200million academy , an entire wall is dedicated to the young stars who have graduated to the first - team			0
each one has his own disc commemorating the date of his debut			0
not surprisingly , @entity9 has been left off the list			2
@entity9 is no longer a source of pride for @entity1			2
his conviction for rape has understandably overshadowed anything he ever achieved on the football pitch			0
but there is a reason why clubs like @entity20 and now @entity21 are prepared to risk their reputations and even sponsorship revenue to sign the player following his release from prison after serving half of a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old woman in 2011 : @entity9 is still potentially a very good player			1
@entity9 last played for @entity20 in april 2012 before being sentenced to five years in prison for rape @entity9 is yet to sign with a club after serving half the term , but he could still be a very good player the two - and - a - half years spent behind bars and time away from a professional sports environment will inevitably have taken its toll			1
however , at the age of 26 , these clubs know that @entity9 could still regain his fitness and form and become a valuable asset to their teams			1
those who witnessed @entity9 ’ progress as a young striker are well aware of his potential			2
coming through the ranks at @entity1 before going out on loan to @entity50 and then joining @entity20 for £ 3million in 2009 , he earned comparisons with a young @entity52			2
@entity9 , pictured with fiance @entity53 on tuesday , could sign a deal with @entity55 's @entity21 until 2017 @entity57 's deal to sign @entity9 is at an advanced stage and is set to be announced on thursday standing 6ft tall , powerfully built , and quick off the mark , the @entity59 had all the tools to be a top striker			1
he was a natural finisher , scoring 35 goals in 42 games in his last season at @entity20 before his conviction			1
but he could also lay on plenty of goals for his teammates and had the kind of awareness and anticipation that separates good strikers from average ones			0
he was a hard - working forward , strong in the air and more than capable of holding the ball up			0
@entity9 slips the ball past @entity80 keeper @entity79 for @entity1 in 2008 @entity9 ( left ) made his debut for @entity1 in 2007 after excelling at youth level professional career @entity1 ' 07 – ' 09 : 16 games , 1 goal @entity50 ( loan ' 07 – ' 08 : 28 games , 10 goals @entity20 ' 09 – 12 : 103 games , 42 goals @entity9 emerged through the ranks at @entity1 in the days before the @entity93 takeover			1
he was a member of the team that reached the 2006 @entity96 final , and the following season scored 16 goals in 23 starts for the club ’s youth team , and six in 10 starts for the reserves			2
he was promoted to the first - team squad and made his debut off the bench in a @entity107 win over @entity50 in september 2007			0
the youngster was called up by @entity110 under - 21s and scored 13 goals in 12 games at that level , including hit a hat - trick against @entity115			1
@entity9 went out on loan to @entity50 for the rest of the season and enhanced his burgeoning reputation by scoring 10 goals from 28 appearances for the @entity50			1
he was one of a number of young players called up to the senior @entity110 squad in may 2008 along with @entity125 and @entity126 , and scored the winner against @entity128 with a backheel just three minutes after coming off the bench			0
it was the first of 13 senior caps for his country			0
@entity134 ( right ) played 13 times for his country and scored on debut against @entity128 @entity9 ( left ) is challenged by @entity138 's @entity137 ( right ) during an international friendly in 2009 following the @entity1 takeover , @entity9 played 25 games for the club in 2008 - 09 , scoring his only @entity144 goal in a 6 - 0 win over @entity80			1
but when @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 arrived in the summer of 2009 , he knew that first - team opportunities would be limited and stepped down to the @entity151 with @entity20 despite speculation linking him with a number of other @entity144 clubs and @entity155			1
it was the @entity157 who first invited @entity9 to train with them following his release from prison before the invitation was withdrawn in the face of a public backlash and opposition from club patrons , sponsors and even local mps			2
@entity169 and @entity170 both rejected the chance to sign him , and now @entity21 have stepped into the firing line			0
given his playing career to date and the often cynical world of football , the club ’s interest in @entity9 should perhaps come as no surprise			0
nor , however , should @entity1 ’s desire to erase him from history .			0

@entity9 served two - and - a - half years of a five - year sentence for rape
at 26 , clubs know @entity9 could still regain his fitness be a valuable asset
clubs linked with signing him have faced outrage from fans and sponsors
he scored 35 goals in 42 games in his last season at @entity20
@entity21 are *believed* to be *poised* to announce his signing
