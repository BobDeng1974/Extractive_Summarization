by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:11 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 20:27 est , 30 december 2012 three out of four doctors struck off the medical register this year were trained abroad , figures show			1
it means that those who qualified overseas were over five times more likely to be struck off than @entity9 graduates			1
the data comes amid growing alarm that many foreign doctors are simply not up to scratch , putting the safety of patients at risk			1
@entity16 , left , died when dr @entity17 gave him a lethal overdose on his first shift providing out of hours care in the @entity9 , while @entity21 , right , died after dr @entity22 missed her cancer for six years three quarters of doctors who have been struck off in the last year were trained abroad there is also concern that @entity30 law prevents doctors from the @entity32 from having their ability to speak @entity34 tested			1
while those from outside the @entity37 sit tests of language and competency before being placed on the medical register , one paper is a multiple - choice exam that can be taken over and over again			2
the @entity43 has now promised to introduce measures to ensure foreign doctors face a more rigorous assessment			1
critics say many of the problems can be traced back to the introduction of a lucrative new contract for gps under the last @entity53 government			2
this allowed them to opt out of out - of - hours work			2
the @entity56 , which limits the working week to 48 hours , has also pushed up demand for locums , some of them flown in			2
the figures , revealed through a @entity62 , show that 194 of the 285 doctors struck off for misconduct or incompetence in the past five years were foreign - trained , while 29 of the 39 removed from the medical register in the past year received their medical degree overseas			1
@entity68 , chief executive of 202 health , has said the assessment of doctors coming into the country should be reviewed with only one - third of the 250,000 doctors on the medical register trained outside the @entity9 , this means that those from overseas were more than five times more likely than @entity9 doctors to be banned			1
the data , from the @entity43 , shows @entity79 has the largest number of doctors struck off in @entity9 since 2008 , followed by @entity82 and @entity83			1
@entity84 has the best record , with none of more than 700 doctors working here struck off or disciplined in the past five years			1
@entity90 ’s 600 medics also have a clean record			2
@entity68 , chief executive of the 2020 health think - tank , said : ‘ these figures are really worrying and shocking			1
we need to take a hard look at the assessment of all doctors coming into the country			1
’ she questioned whether foreign - trained locums are familiar with @entity9 medical practices , adding : ‘ if i was a hospital chief executive , i would check just how rigorously we have assessed our own doctors			1
’ @entity102 , of campaign group @entity103 , said money may help buy medical qualifications in some countries			2
fear of reprisals may mean health professionals are less willing to report colleagues based in @entity9 , he claimed			0
@entity112 , vice-chairman of the @entity111 , said : ‘ the @entity113 is known for having problems with discrimination and racism and i think this is part of it			0
’ dr @entity112 , who trained in @entity79 , said that the technical training there is similar to that in @entity9 – but it is more difficult to learn the ‘ softer ’ skills needed and to ensure that patients feel they are being treated courteously			1
dr @entity125 , left , was suspended for 12 months in july 2010 after failing to spot the abuse of @entity127 , while dr @entity128 , right , was struck off in august after the botched post-mortem of @entity130 dr @entity131 , of the @entity132 , said : ‘ it is clear that doctors who have qualified overseas are more likely to be subject to disciplinary action			1
however , more research is needed to understand why this is the case			0
‘ the @entity9 is still short of doctors and so we must ensure that those who come from overseas are given adequate support to be able to practise medicine in the @entity9			1
’ @entity43 chief executive @entity142 said : ‘ we absolutely acknowledge that when it comes to the serious end of the scale , those from overseas are more likely to appear , and we have set about a series of reforms to address this			1
’ this includes a requirement that all doctors working the @entity9 undergo annual appraisals			2
an induction scheme for all doctors new to the health service is to be piloted and the tests for @entity159 doctors are being reviewed			2
eight patients a week are left brain - damaged , blind or missing an arm or leg due to @entity113 blunders			0
in 2010 - 11 alone , more than £ 30million paid out to those who lost a limb or left blind or suffering a brain injury as a result of careless and incompetent medical staff			0
there were 215 claims in that year for brain damage - and almost £ 12million paid out			0
the @entity172 handled 134 claims involving the amputation of a limb , at cost to the taxpayer of £ 18million			0
there were also 56 claims for blindness in @entity34			0
since 1998 , at least 1,500 people have sued over a lost limb , 2,860 for brain damage and 809 over being blinded			0
when all types of medical negligence are taken into account , the @entity113 paid out a record £ 1.3billion in 2010/11			0
a 46 per cent increase on the previous year , the total includes a small amount for non-medical claims , including slips and falls in hospitals			0
the rise is blamed on no - win , no fee lawyers , who sometimes pocket far more money than the patients they represent			0
@entity200 mp @entity199 , a member of the @entity202 health select committee said : ' where there is negligence and poor performance , we should n't be afraid to root it out			0
' we must put patients first if we are to have a world - class @entity113			0
' @entity210 , chief executive of the @entity172 said : ' in general the @entity113 is very safe but if an @entity113 patient has suffered injury as a result of a mistake , it is right that they are financially compensated			0
' we aim to help reduce claims by working with the @entity113 to prevent mistakes from happening in the first place			0
