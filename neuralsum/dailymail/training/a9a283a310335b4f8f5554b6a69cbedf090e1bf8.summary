by @entity0 published : 23:26 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 10 september 2013 @entity1 , a designer who attracted worldwide acclaim last january when @entity3 wore his custom design to her husband ’s second inauguration , staged his semiannual womenswear fashion show early monday evening			1
mr @entity1 , a long - time favorite within the fashion industry as well as the @entity11 commercial market , stunned audiences with his dream - like take on what was ‘ loosely based off of @entity16 clowns ’ he told @entity17 before his show began			1
the procession , fabricated nearly entirely in white fabric ( sometimes supplemented with hints of navy ) , was a study in both dramatic referencing and textural interest			0
pale and interesting : @entity1 's collection was mostly fabricated in white , with some navy flourishes challenge : the collection was a study in both dramatic referencing and textural interest ‘ it was a challenge to do it [ in all white ] ’ mr @entity1 told us backstage			1
‘ especially to have forty looks that had very different textures within them			0
’ he staged the show in an equally white - washed room , built to resemble a mental institution , with padded and tiled walls			1
a small handful of models dressed in mr @entity1 ’s take on nurses ’ uniforms emerged first , each administering small plastic cups of white @entity50 ( presumably in place of @entity52 ) to amused audience members			2
seal of approval : @entity1 designed @entity3 's ensemble for president @entity3 's second inauguration then came the hospital ’s patients , dressed in an array of boned nipped - waist looks , armed with high - neck collars , confused ( or sometimes narcissistic ) stares , and the kind of intricate detailing that would rival collections from any of @entity66 ’s great fashion houses			1
many of the silhouettes on display were similar to the ones utilized by mr @entity1 in his last few womenswear collections — which makes sense , as he ’s a classicist at heart			1
‘ i never pay attention to any kinds of trends or anything , ’ he told us			0
‘ i just think that preppy @entity79 feels good and that it ’s kind of timeless and it ’s what i like			0
’ much like his flair for showmanship , mr @entity1 has never been one to shy away from a strong preppy hand			2
showering his army of lacy clowns in small anchors , pearls , and penny loafer heels was the least of his challenges this season			0
‘ i just do it ’ he said of his process for layering references			0
in sending his models to a metal facility , mr @entity1 explored the more pervasive qualities of his own work			2
his clothes have a consistently disturbing quality to them , often aided by extreme hair and make - up techniques			2
but by dressing up his models in smeared red lipstick , chokingly - tight latex collars , and woven wicker petticoats , mr @entity1 aired his fashion disturbances with an even stronger edge			1
‘ i do my shows and the more conceptual part of what i do to make the commercial side more interesting , ’ he told us			0
‘ and even as conceptual as they are , they are seriously made as really classic pieces of clothes			0
’ attention to detail : mr @entity1 examines his designs backstage before monday 's womenswear show that much may be true — sheath dresses , tailored blazers , and closely - shorn pencil skirts all lay at the root of mr @entity1 ’s sartorial intellect for spring			1
their fabrications however , added to the collection ’s otherworldly sense			0
@entity133 - like pleated chiffons , cobwebby laces , and @entity136 tweeds took mr @entity1 ’s designs to another dimension			1
as did a honeycomb - like material that likely pleased many of the audience ’s many @entity142 members , many of which came dressed in head - to - toe @entity1 looks ( the fabric strongly resembled the foam material traditionally used to wrap and protect @entity142 peaches )			2
timeless : boxy handbags and penny loafer heels had their roots in preppy @entity79 setting the stage : mr @entity1 's designs have a consistently disturbing quality to them , often aided by extreme hair and make - up techniques ghostly presence : @entity1 offered a haunting all - white collection for spring 2014 but most importantly ( at least for mr @entity1 ’s sake ) is how his show ’s enormous audience proved that his womenswear label is gaining serious ground in both the commercial and critical realms			1
in the last few seasons , it ’s seemed to at least double in size			0
‘ @entity3 definitely helped , ’ mr @entity1 told us of his womenswear ’s escalating success			2
‘ it feels good , i am very serious about making good clothes for women , so i like to see that they appreciate it			0

@entity1 's womenswear line got a high - *profile* endorsement earlier this year , when the @entity183 wore a custom creation to the president 's second inauguration
the show was staged in a room *styled* to resemble a mental institution
