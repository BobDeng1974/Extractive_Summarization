many said they had no idea if the person administering the injection was appropriately trained to perform the procedure			0

a third confessed to feeling nervous or frightened before , during and after the procedure they underwent			0
the average age of @entity0 patients is 35 - 44 , and 70 per cent opt for the procedure to look ‘ a little fresher '			1

a third confessed to feeling nervous or frightened before , during and after the procedure the company is concerned about the increase in patients undergoing treatment in less than sterile environments , delivered by unqualified practitioners			1
a spokesperson for non-surgical treatments at @entity71 stresses the importance of knowing what 's going into your face			0
they said : ' there are subtle differences in the chemical formulations of the main brands of @entity18 toxin available in the @entity82			0
' this has many implications			0
' @entity0 ' should always be refrigerated - and if it 's not , you should quiz your practitioner			1
' similarly , there are usually differences in pricing and the efficacy of each i.e. the effects of one may last longer than another			0
' botulinum toxin is available under four product formulations : @entity0 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98			2
while all four are generated from same bacteria , the @entity0 brand has most @entity18 toxin in it and lasts longest			2
@entity0 comes with a red or purple top , while for example @entity104 and @entity98 have blue tops			2
you can also tell them apart as @entity0 has a hologram and is kept in a fridge			2

' as part of our @entity119 and in support of current reviews into the regulation of cosmetic surgery , transform is keen to raise awareness of misconceptions around line and wrinkle treatments			0
we have long suspected a lack of understanding and knowledge ; perhaps exacerbated by less than forthcoming information from some practitioners			0
transform see a 15 per cent rise in the number of patients seeking help following ineffective treatments ' we hope that in highlighting this , consumers who wish to undergo non-surgical treatment for lines and wrinkles will ask better questions of their practitioner , and themselves if they are seeing a great ' deal ' , or a lower than usual price			1
at transform , treatments are always conducted in a clinical environment , and more importantly by fully trained clinical staff			0
' dr @entity152 , an independent member of @entity71 's @entity153 said : ' informed consent is vital for any medical procedure and cosmetic interventions such as anti-wrinkle injections are no exception			2
' it is essential that each patient understands exactly which product is being injected into their body and whether the brand of @entity18 toxin used meets stringent standards of quality efficacy and above all safety , and has an enduring and proven track record			0
if someone is offered @entity0 specifically for example , that is exactly what they should be given and nothing else			2
' we want patients to be in a better position to make an informed decision about their chosen practitioner and the wrinkle treatment being administered			2
' @entity0 is one of four licensed toxin products used for the treatment of lines and wrinkles			1
however , there are nuances between each and patients should be looking to their practitioner to explain what product is being used and why			0
according to consultant plastic surgeon and member of the @entity194 , mr @entity195 : ' @entity0 , @entity96 are the same product where former is 100units and latter 50units per vial			1
@entity199 formerly know as dysport is a cheaper alternative as is @entity98			0
the cost of the the alternative products is cheaper and not always passed on to the patient			0
in my personal experience , i prefer @entity0 and @entity207 as the molecules are larger and therefore i feel more accurate to position in areas especially near they eye			2
' smaller molecules from other products may diffuse and move to areas where you do n't want the product			0
' patients who have had the alternatives feel the effects may not last as long as @entity0 / @entity96			1
' the scientific name for @entity0 is @entity18 toxin one gram of @entity18 toxin is all that 's required to make a whole year 's supply of @entity0 botulinum toxin is available under four product formulations : @entity0 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 botox brand has most @entity18 toxin in it and lasts longer than @entity207 , @entity97 , and @entity98 all generated from same bacteria but @entity0 is strongest and most effective on the market @entity0 comes with a red or purple top			1
