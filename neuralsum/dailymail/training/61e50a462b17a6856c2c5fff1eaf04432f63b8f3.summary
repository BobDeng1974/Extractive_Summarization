@entity0 was in trouble and simply heading for the nearest safe airport when it turned off - course , according to a veteran pilot who predicts , in a viral online post , that the wreckage will be discovered somewhere west of the @entity6 today			1
@entity7 , a @entity8 pilot with 20 years experience , has hailed captain @entity10 a hero , not a hijacker , in his fascinating explanation , which claims to debunks all theories about the fate of the missing jet			1
he insists the only reasonable scenario is that a fire broke out aboard the plane and @entity10 was doing exactly what he needed to do in an emergency - get the plane to the nearest airport as soon as possible			1
in this case , that was the 13,000 foot strip @entity25 , and that is directly where the aircraft was heading when it was last tracked			1
however , @entity7 believes the crew were overcome by smoke and the aircraft flew as a ' ghost plane ' for hours past the chosen airport before finally crashing into the @entity32 near the @entity6			1
always , ' @entity7 wrote			0
' instinctively when i saw that left turn with a direct heading i knew he was heading for an airport			0
' he said he immediately brought up @entity54 and discovered the runway , which was had fewer obstacles blocking the plane 's approach than if @entity10 attempted to return to @entity59 , which was also further away			2
' this pilot did all the right things			0
he was confronted by some major event aboard that made him make that immediate turn back to the closest safe airport , ' he says in the post			1
@entity7 's initial post went took the web by storm after he posted it on @entity70 and then @entity71			2
simple theory : @entity7 , a @entity8 pilot with 20 years experience , has hailed captain @entity10 a hero , not a hijacker , in his interesting post , which took the internet by storm he wrote a number of follow up posts answering the hundreds of questions he had received as more information , and speculation , came to light			1
in his last note late on tuesday , he claimed reported sightings of an aircraft over the @entity6 corresponds to his theory and he predicted it will be found sometime wednesday a small distance west of the @entity6			1
in his first post , @entity7 said the loss of transponders and communications makes ' perfect sense ' in the event of a fire			1
he suggests an electrical fire may have started inside the plane , perhaps incapacitating crew with smoke			2
the plane 's cargo - which reportedly included a shipment of lithium batteries - may have ignited			0
or possibly one of the tires overheated during takeoff and began burning slowly , eventually making it to the cockpit where the pilots were overcome by smoke			0
he said all the circumstances that night - a full plane , hot weather , and a long run takeoff runway - make this incident all the more plausible , and he cited a similar occurrence in @entity119 of a @entity120 that had a landing gear fire on takeoff			1
he believes at that point , the @entity123 plane ' just continued on ( that route ) probably on ( autopilot ) until either fuel exhaustion or fire destroyed the control surfaces and it crashed			2
' ' i said four days ago you will find it along that route - looking elsewhere was pointless , ' @entity7 added in his captivating piece			0
he said he has been stunned that no officials , pilots or reporters have looked at the case from the pilot 's point of view			0
' thanks to @entity142 earth i spotted @entity25 in about 30 seconds , zoomed in and saw how long the runway was and i just instinctively knew this pilot knew this airport			2
he had probably flown there many times , ' the pilot wrote			0
as for the last voice transmission , @entity7 told said ' good night ' is customary as a hand - off to a new air traffic controller and also strongly indicates to him that all was ok on the flight deck			0
emergency landing : @entity7 said he knew within 30 seconds of pulling up @entity54 that @entity10 was heading for an emergency landing at in this case , that was the 13,000 foot strip known as @entity25 , pictured the missing plane , considered history 's worst aviation disaster , went missing on march 8 with 239 people on board he said there are many ways to communicate distress , but at this point he does n't believe the pilots knew anything was wrong , though things may well have been in the process of unraveling			1
he says the plane would have had around 8 hours of fuel , possibly more , and 20 - 25 per cent would have been burned with takeoff and the climb to cruise			2
when the turn was made toward @entity37 , he would have had six hours or more worth of fuel left , which he says ' correlates nicely ' with the fact data was still being detected until fuel exhaustion			0
' ( this ) only confirms to me that the crew was incapacitated and the flight continued on deep into the south @entity32 , ' he said			0
whatever caused what he believes was a serious mechanical issue , @entity7 believes @entity10 was bravely attempting to save his life and the lives of his crew and passengers			2
' capt. @entity10 was a hero struggling with an impossible situation trying to get that plane to @entity25			1
there is no doubt in my mind , ' he said			0
just did n't have the time			0

veteran @entity8 pilot @entity7 says his viral online post debunks claims that the missing @entity202 was hijacked
instead , he hails captain @entity10 a hero , insisting the only reasonable scenario is that a fire broke out and the pilot was trying to make an emergency landing at the nearest safe airport
he says @entity10 turned the plane to aim for a 13,000 foot strip @entity25 but was likely overcome by smoke before he could land
the aircraft then continued flying as a ' ghost plane ' for several hours before finally running out of fuel and crashing into the @entity32
he predicts the wreckage will be found somewhere west of the @entity6 today
