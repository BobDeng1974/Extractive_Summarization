for @entity1 the cost of staying alive is $ 16,000 every three weeks			1
this is what the @entity4 leukaemia patient must pay for a new drug treatment that is keeping him alive			0
the 35 - year - old , father - of - two from @entity8 says the non-taxpayer subsidised treatment for his @entity12 's disease - @entity11 - has improved his condition dramatically			1
it 's for this reason that his ' my name is @entity1 ' campaign and website was created to help raise the money needed for his treatment as it ca n't be distributed on the current @entity22 ( @entity22 )			1
his family argue that it also reinforces why it is essential to get @entity12 's lymphoma treatment , @entity11 , on the @entity22			1
' my name is @entity1 ' was launched in mid-january following confirmation of @entity1 's relapse in december , and it has made a huge difference , ' @entity1 's wife @entity26 told @entity48			1
' words ca n't describe ! without the campaign , we simply would not be able to afford to access @entity11			0
the @entity1 family are hoping that the new treatment will mean there are happier times ahead @entity1 and his son @entity56 share a hug in hospital in december after @entity1 hears the devastating news he had relapsed @entity1 and his one - year - old son @entity27 enjoy some time out together ' mentally it has also had a huge impact on @entity1 , he literally thought he was going to die in december , by the end of january he was feeling well , and inspired to fight harder than ever before			1
' some of the fundraising that has taken place and donations given to the campaign have hugely raised his spirits too , with people 's generosity taking him aback			2

' over @entity74 we held the @entity75 which raised $ 15,000 as well as an event ' @entity77 ' at @entity78 where we operated the bbq and gate , collecting $ 3425.40			0
a hospital bill shows the $ 16,000 cost of @entity1 's @entity11 treatment it 's not just adults that have been helping - kids also proudly wear ' my name is @entity1 ' t - shirts that have been purchased ' @entity78 matched that , meaning we raised $ 6850.80 - so in two days we raised close to $ 22,000			1
' one donation in particular stood out for @entity1 and showed humanity at its best			2
it took place in march when @entity1 was at a fishing event - the @entity97 selling merchandise for the ' my name is @entity1 ' campaign			1
' a young boy , maybe 8 or 9 years old was talking to him and said his grandma had passed away from cancer , ' @entity1 explains			2
' he then disappeared and came back with a handful of coins - he donated all that he had to help			2
' this was extremely moving and quite emotional			0
' a cricket bat signed by all the @entity108 team was just one item that was auctioned to help raise money for @entity1 's treatment @entity1 has been humbled by the generosity that has been shown to him in recent months it 's been a taxing time for @entity1 , his wife @entity26 , 32 , and his two young sons @entity56 , 4 , and @entity27 , 1 , but they remain positive that thanks to his treatment they will still share many happy years together			1

a @entity137 signed shirt was overwhelmingly popular at a recent auction for the cause @entity1 's treatment at @entity31 has been going well ' it 's important to remember cancer is a word , not a sentence			1
' @entity146 also reports that @entity26 told a @entity29 inquiry on monday of the family 's initial distress when trying to raise the sum for each dose of the new drug treatment			2
' it 's been hard going , i 've been away from the boys , ' she told the inquiry hearing in @entity30			0
