by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:09 est , 26 february 2014 the mystery behind the ‘ blueberries ’ on @entity5 may have finally been solved			1
these marble - sized objects are remnants of small meteorites that broke up in the @entity5 atmosphere , according to scientists in @entity11			1
researchers had previously thought that the blueberries were evidence of water flowing over the martian surface billions of years ago			1
these marble - sized objects , nicknamed ' blueberries , are remnants of small meteorites that broke up in the @entity5 atmosphere , according to scientists in @entity11 the tiny sphericals were discovered on @entity5 by @entity20 ’s opportunity rover a decade ago near the @entity21 , and scientists have since been baffled by their origin			1
‘ they seem to be crunchy on the outside , and softer in the middle , ’ @entity19 's principal investigator , @entity24 said			0
‘ they are different in concentration			0
they are different in structure			0
they are different in composition			0
they are different in distribution			0
so , we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us			0
’ the tiny sphericals were discovered on @entity5 by @entity20 's opportunity rover a decade ago near the @entity21 , and scientists have since been baffled by their origin some scientists maintain that the research in @entity11 is overlooking key data			1
many still believe the ' blueberries ' point to evidence of water on @entity5 billions of years ago			1
they believe these iron - rich orbs , discovered at the rover 's landing site in 2004 , formed when the @entity5 was warm enough to host liquid water			1
in some places minerals precipitated out of the water as it diffused through rock , leaving behind hard masses			2
@entity58 eventually exposed the blueberries embedded in outcrops			2
. one theory suggests that magma from volcanic eruptions , rather than water , may have formed the orbs			1
however , large amounts of the iron - bearing mineral hematite have been found in these blueberries , which could suggest they formed when groundwater flowed through porous rocks			2
water flow can trigger chemical reactions that cause the iron minerals form into small sphere			2
but this theory does n’t explain the narrows sizes of the blueberries			1
in the journal @entity81 , scientists at the @entity79 in @entity80 suggest that a meteorite impact better explains the shape and composition of @entity5 blueberries			1
‘ none of the physical properties of the spherules match the concretion model , ’ @entity87 , who led the study , told @entity89 at @entity90			0
‘ but the meteorite theory explains all of their properties			1
’ the paper points to uniformity of hematite rocks on @entity5			2
most of the hematite rocks are about 0.16 inches ( 4mm ) in diameter , and usually no larger than 0.24 inches ( 6.2mm )			0
the bluberries are thought to be composed of hematite			0
this is the mineral form of iron oxide that leaches out of the soil as ground water rises up through it professor @entity87 said these size differences can be explained if the @entity5 rocks came from meteor impacts			1
according to the researchers , a meteorite 1.6 inches ( 4 cm ) in diameter could scatter a thousand 0.16 - inch spherules over a large area			0
however , the theory has proved to be controversial , with some arguing that the conclusions do n’t take into account key facts			0
‘ these spherules did n't form from some kind of high - temperature event , as you would expect from something melting in the @entity5 atmosphere , ’ @entity123 , a geoscientist at @entity124 in @entity125 , told @entity90			2
opportunity ’s analysis of the blueberries suggests that they formed during a low temperature process , he said			0
according to the researchers , a meteorite 1.6 inches ( 4 cm ) in diameter could scatter a thousand 0.16 - inch spherules over a large area			0

martian spheres , named ' blueberries ' , have left experts baffled for a decade
now scientists claim a meteorite may have scattered blueberries on @entity5
this contradicts an *earlier* theory that the blueberries were evidence of water flowing on @entity5 billions of years ago
