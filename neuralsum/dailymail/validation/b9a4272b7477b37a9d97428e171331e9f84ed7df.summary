passengers have been told by rail companies not to travel by train this easter as the closure of major routes will cause chaos			0
beleaguered travellers have been warned that ‘ @entity3 is cancelled ’ as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed			0
on others they face hours of delays , with some journey times quadrupled			0
worst affected will be the @entity14 main line , where @entity15 has told passengers not to bother trying to travel			1
on @entity40 a 55 - minute direct trip from @entity39 to @entity35 will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes , with two trains and two buses			1
a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ @entity3 is effectively cancelled – our line is shut			2
we ’re advising people not to travel			0
‘ what makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering			2
’ failures : poor planning , equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the @entity61 train chaos , including a crush at @entity63 ( pictured ) , a report has found other services blighted by engineering works include @entity66 , which uses the same west coast line and has issued a similar warning , and swathes of the @entity26 and @entity28 lines			1
virgin services to @entity72 and the @entity73 and @entity74 are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys			2
@entity78 chief executive @entity77 apologised for disruption from the £ 100million works by 14,000 engineering workers , but insisted it was vital			2
however , the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at @entity61 when the key @entity88 main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works , prompting a major inquiry , damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs , and a grovelling apology from rail bosses			1
cancellations : the report found that when work near @entity99 overran the trains were switched to start and finish at @entity63 station but ' not enough was done ' to manage passenger flow at the new station under a large headline on its website , @entity15 warns passengers of the impending @entity3 chaos with the words : ‘ there ’s a spanner in the works			1
do n’t get caught in planned improvement works			0
’ it said there would not be any trains to or from @entity35 , adding : ‘ there wo n’t be any replacement shuttles either , so finding an alternative train service to @entity35 will be very difficult			0
’ engineering works on the line between @entity120 and @entity121 and from @entity122 to @entity123 will ‘ severely reduce services to the @entity73 and @entity125 ’ , it said			1
services are also likely to be ‘ extra busy the day before and after affected days ’ and passengers should book early			1
@entity14 passengers also face major works at @entity130 from an £ 81million programme from @entity78 ‘ to improve the ageing infrastructure ’			1
rail bosses say carrying out works during @entity61 and @entity3 is justified as passenger numbers are down by up to 40 per cent because there are far fewer commuters			0
but ministers have suggested carrying out such works at times other than at @entity61 and @entity3 – such as through the summer – to avoid hitting families travelling during the key holiday periods			2
mr @entity77 said : ‘ we are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays to reunite with their friends and families , which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period , but there will be disruption for some			0
’ he insisted that there were ‘ good contingency plans in place ’ while the improvements are carried out .			0
