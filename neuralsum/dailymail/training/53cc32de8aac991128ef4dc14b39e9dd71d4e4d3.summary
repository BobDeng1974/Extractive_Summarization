the alleged exchanges between @entity1 and @entity2 show a culture of racism , prejudice , homophobia and arrogance that i know to be the unfortunate true face of top - level professional football			1
so why should we care that two middle - aged white men have what seem to be entrenched views of others who are different from them ? these texts show a way of talking , behaving and thinking that i do n’t particularly like , but why should football care ? we should care because this whole issue turns ugly when you realise how such views make people act			1
when you read the accusations of @entity27 ( @ ibby_farah ) about a culture of racism at @entity30 under @entity1 , it starts to take a sinister turn			1
people who exclude others who do n’t fit into their little pockets of comfort and small - minded views of the world are dangerous			0
the truth is , nothing in the alleged exchanges surprised me			1
this is how football talks in private , and more importantly , how it behaves in public			2
this is the reality and the gravity of the situation anyone outside the , male , white , old boy network exists in			0
is it any wonder we have 92 professional clubs but no @entity64 ( black and minority ethnic ) managers ? many will leap to the defence of these two men			0
i am sure they gave regular playing time to one or two black players and probably had a few around for tea who may retain some loyalty to their ‘ mates ’			0
i am sure both are a riot in the pub on a saturday night			0
not surprised : former @entity82 striker @entity81 was n't shocked by the alleged exchange but make no mistake , the game will be straining at the leash to find a way back for both @entity2 and @entity1 when the brief outcry simmers down			1
if they are struggling for work and play their cards right i ’m sure there will be media work available to them			0
without meaningful changes to the structure of our game , from boardrooms to grass roots , football will continue to be run in a manner akin to the dialogue alleged here			1
there are many more where @entity2 and @entity1 came from			1
unfortunately for them , they are just the ones who got caught			0
the @entity109 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity1 ’s time at @entity30			1
in the course of a search by the @entity119 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity1 ’s employment at @entity30 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity127 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity127 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			2
that said , @entity127 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity144 process is complete			1
the @entity109 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity127 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			2
if @entity127 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity127 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity144 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity164			1
@entity127 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			1
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity127 ’s involvement in this matter			2
@entity127 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity127 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity127 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity144 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter			2
