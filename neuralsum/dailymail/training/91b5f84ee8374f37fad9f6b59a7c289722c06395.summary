three months into his new life in @entity2 and the most memorable contribution from @entity4 remains that peculiar pose on the fringes of a group photograph			1
it proved an internet hit and @entity4 took the jokes in good spirit but the snapshot seems to have captured accurately a footballer with peripheral role in the squad , unable to mix with his new colleagues as he gets to grips with the language			1
the former @entity19 and @entity20 defender is slowly learning some @entity21 , but it is a new trick for a 33 - year - old and he is naturally more comfortable in the company of @entity26 team - mates who speak good @entity27 such as @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity4 looked to be distant from his team - mates during a @entity26 team photo @entity4 has failed to replicate the high standards he had previously shown in the @entity34 @entity28 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) are among @entity4 's closest friends at @entity26 the 33 - year - old has played four league games for @entity26 since joining the club on a free transfer on the pitch , he has not dazzled			1
reporters who cover the @entity42 have rated him with fives and sixes in his opening games and compared him unfavourably to @entity46 , who arrived 12 months earlier at the age of 32 and , after initial concerns , proved to be an inspired acquisition			0
@entity4 's appearances for @entity26 so far : @entity26 2 - 0 @entity51 @entity26 2 - 0 @entity52 @entity53 0 - 1 @entity26 @entity26 2 - 0 @entity54 for @entity26 , however , the season could not have started better			1
the @entity42 have won their first six in all competitions			0
they trail champions @entity57 at the top of @entity59 only on goal difference and smashed five past @entity61 in their @entity63 opener			0
@entity4 was left out against @entity61 , as versatile @entity65 @entity64 , who normally plays on the right , was switched to left back to mark @entity67			2
former @entity34 star @entity4 was also an unused substitute for the game against @entity69 , but has since returned to the team and played 90 minutes at the weekend in the win against @entity51			2
' team work makes the dream work , ' tweeted @entity4 , after helping @entity26 make it 15 points from five games in @entity59 if there is one thing he really does know about it is winning			1
thirteen major trophies in @entity81 tells you that			2
@entity4 arrived at @entity83 on monday morning ahead of his side 's @entity63 encounter the former @entity20 and @entity19 ace will know all about facing @entity34 champions @entity87 @entity26 will look to utilise @entity4 's experience of playing against @entity63 opponents @entity87 @entity4 went on @entity90 on sunday to reveal his delight at @entity26 's 2 - 0 win against @entity51 boss @entity93 is convinced the @entity95 will adjust to @entity21 football			1
the tempo is slower than the @entity34 , which should offset his age ( @entity99 is still starring at 38 ) , and @entity4 has more @entity63 experience than any other player in the @entity26 squad			1
when asked how he has fit in , @entity93 has said @entity4 is ' quiet ' and ' polite ' and working hard , determined to make the move a success			1
a career in @entity2 is not built in a day , after all			0
@entity4 ’s attitude to training has never been questioned , even if he has annoyed managers like @entity109 and @entity110 at times with his fondness for night - life			1
he has yet to find his way into @entity21 ’s gossip columns			2
among team - mates , he has always been popular and it has been quite some time since he was an eye - catching , flying full back			0
in his @entity19 years , he was more of a solid and reliable performer , low on errors , leaning on his nous and ability to read the game while rarely doing anything flash ( at least not on the pitch ) and never letting his team - mates down			2
occasionally he would produce a barely - believable clearance as a reminder of his individual quality			0
this is what made him the best @entity27 left back of his generation and earned him more than 100 international caps			0
it is a little surprising , therefore , that the @entity21 media have been unimpressed with his defensive acumen , while satisfied with his ability to get forward and deliver a cross			2
@entity19 boss @entity110 decided it was time to move @entity4 on at the end of last season @entity4 said an emotional farewell to the @entity146 faithful after leaving the club in the summer the former @entity81 full back represented his country 107 times before announcing his international retirement in may 2014 october 2013 : @entity19 2 - 1 @entity87 ( @entity34 ) w february 2013 : @entity83 2 - 0 @entity19 ( @entity34 ) l november 2012 : @entity19 0 - 0 @entity87 ( @entity34 ) d august 2012 : @entity19 2 - 3 @entity87 ( @entity152 ) l march 2012 : @entity87 2 - 1 @entity19 ( @entity34 ) l december 2011 : @entity19 2 - 1 @entity87 ( @entity34 ) w @entity4 knows how to defend			1
this is something he will crack when he understands the details of @entity21 football and can communicate more effectively			2
his mature defensive profile fits with the traditional image of a full back in the @entity21 game			0
they are in the team primarily to defend , although modern coaches demand a little more mileage and creative input from their full backs			0
@entity4 ’s advancing years – he will be 34 in december - and his battle - scarred ankles may be limiting his involvement			0
it certainly seemed that way during his final months at @entity19 , when he lost his place to @entity171			0
but , even last season , when he did not have the advantage of regular football , he summoned memorable performances as @entity19 kept a clean sheet at @entity177 and @entity81 did the same in @entity179			1
he ought to be at his best in games when @entity26 are tested defensively			0
in that sense , the game at @entity87 will be a more accurate barometer on the direction of his form since leaving @entity19 , or on sunday in @entity187 , when @entity26 face title rivals @entity57			1
perhaps this is the week when @entity4 discovers if he will ever be anything other than a peripheral figure in the @entity2			0
@entity194 lauds enduring stalwart @entity99			0

former @entity19 defender @entity4 is yet to get to grips with life in @entity21
he has failed to stand out for @entity26 , with the @entity21 press often giving him a match rating of five or six
@entity202 will be *hoping* to impress on his return to @entity81
@entity93 believes @entity4 will adjust to playing for an @entity21 club
