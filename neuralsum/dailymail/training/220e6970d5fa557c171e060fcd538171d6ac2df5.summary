by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 14:26 est , 20 february 2013 we still do n't know why @entity2 learned to walk : the famous 3.2million - year - old hominid fossil was found in @entity4 , one of the regions analysed a new study has cast doubt on the long - held theory that our ancestors evolved to walk upright to help them see farther on @entity12 's vast open grasslands			1
scientists have long believed that early human ancestors began walking on two legs as a response to savannah encroaching on shrinking rainforests in north - east @entity12			1
with fewer trees to swing from , human ancestors began walking to get around , while walking on two legs enabled them to see predators and prey further afield , the theory claims			2
but now a new analysis of the past 12million years ' of vegetation change in the cradle of humanity has challenged long - held beliefs about the world in which our ancestors took shape - and , by extension , the impact it had on them			1
it found that while the shift to bipedalism seems to have occurred somewhere between 4million and 6million years ago , rainforests had been replaced by grasslands and seasonally dry forests some time before 12million years ago			2
not only that , the tropical grasses and shrubs of the modern @entity12 savannah began to dominate the landscape earlier than thought , replacing other kinds of grasses better suited to a wetter environment			1
@entity47 , of the @entity48 , set out to investigate what types of vegetation dominated the landscape surrounding the @entity52			2
the area , which includes present - day @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity4 , is where early hominin fossils trace the history of human evolution			0
by combining sediment core studies of the waxy molecules from plant leaves with pollen analysis , dr @entity47 was able to investigate plant molecules dating back to between 12million and 1million years ago			0
' it is the combination of evidence both molecular and pollen evidence that allows us to say just how long we 've seen @entity73 - type open grasslands , ' she said			1
earlier studies on vegetation change through this period relied on the analysis of individual sites throughout the @entity52 - offering narrow snapshots			1
but dr @entity47 took a look at the whole picture by using a sediment core taken in the @entity83 , where winds funnel and deposit sediment from the entire region			0
she then cross-referenced her findings with @entity88 , of @entity89 , who has compiled data from ancient soil samples collected throughout eastern @entity12			1
' the combination of marine and terrestrial data enable us to link the environmental record at specific fossil sites to regional ecological and climate change , ' said dr @entity98			0
not much changed in 12million years : an acacia tree stands in the @entity54 savannah			0
dr @entity47 set out to investigate what types of vegetation dominated the landscape surrounding the @entity52 over history as well as informing scientists about the environment our ancestors took shape in , the study gives insights into the landscape that herbivores like horses , hippos and antelopes grazed , as well as how plants across the landscape reacted to periods of global and regional environmental change			2
' the types of grasses appear to be sensitive to global carbon dioxide levels , ' said co-author @entity123 , a graduate student at @entity48			0
she is currently working to refine the data pertaining to the @entity125 , to provide an even clearer picture of a period that experienced similar atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to present day			0
' there might be lessons in here for the future viability of our grain crops , ' added dr @entity47 .			0

new analysis of vegetation change in north - east @entity12 shows forests *disappeared* long before we evolved to walk on two legs
