by @entity0 for the @entity1 a generation of teachers will struggle to introduce a tough new school curriculum because of their own poor grasp of the three rs , a leading headmistress warned today			1
many bright teachers are ‘ completely at sea ’ with proper @entity16 grammar and have little knowledge of the literary canon because their own education lacked rigour , according to @entity13			1
teachers had been ‘ hastily ’ swotting up ahead of the introduction of the new curriculum across primary and secondary schools this week			2
problem : teachers do not have a good enough grasp of @entity16 grammar , warns a leading headmistress but mrs @entity13 , president of the @entity28 ’ @entity27 , warned that extra training courses were not enough and called for more rigorous degrees for would - be teachers			1
under the new curriculum , more emphasis will be placed on giving pupils a grounding in @entity16 grammar and punctuation			1
pupils will also be required to study a broader range of classic literary works including at least one 19th century novel and a selection of poetry since 1789			0
in maths , pupils will be required to cover more material with greater emphasis on times tables , fractions , algebra and mental arithmetic			0
but mrs @entity13 , head of fee - paying @entity52 , near @entity53 , @entity51 warned that a generation of teachers would struggle to deliver the lessons because their own education lacked ‘ breadth ’			1
she said her school had introduced a specific @entity16 grammar course for 11 - year - olds only to discover that some staff were ill - equipped to teach it			1
‘ in the process of introducing the course we quickly established that some of our younger teachers have not been taught @entity16 grammar in the 90s and 00s when they were at school themselves and , consequently , they feel less confident as they teach as relatively new learners themselves , ’ she said in a blog for the @entity66 teachers ’ journal			1
‘ many of our brightest , most enthusiastic teachers have little or no grounding in @entity16 language or grammar – through no fault of their own - and are completely at sea with many aspects of proper usage , ’ she added			1
they would struggle to ‘ delve into the mysteries of subordinate clauses ’ with a class of 14 - year - olds , she said			0
she also warned that some @entity16 literature teachers were ‘ frankly , unversed in much pre- 20th century literature ’			1
without prior knowledge of a broad range of texts , teachers may simply ‘ bone up on two or three texts and stick to them ’			0
but mrs @entity13 added : ‘ this is not at all in the spirit of the new curriculum , nor will it be permissible			2
‘ whilst , with the old gcse , a teacher could stick determinedly to one or two staples , the new curriculum will change set text lists more regularly			0
‘ this is a welcome return to variety , but are we supporting our teachers to be ready and is there time to get this right for the first generation of students ? ’ in maths , there was already a shortage of qualified teachers			0
this would lead to problems teaching the new so - called ‘ big fat maths ’ curriculum , said mrs @entity13			2
‘ while we undoubtedly have teachers who know the maths , there are not enough of them around to teach the extras			0
‘ this can only mean that schools will be placing in front of students teachers for whom maths is not their degree subject , or even an allied subject			0
’ in a series of proposals , mrs @entity13 called for student debt to be waived for graduates who stayed in teaching for 10 years			2
she also called for a government pr campaign targeting pupils as young as 17 to encourage them to become teachers as well as a new breed of ‘ subject - focused ’ degree courses combined with educational theory to encourage more bright students into the profession			2
‘ bridging the knowledge gap for a generation of teachers whose own education may not have included the breadth that the new curriculum espouses is our immediate task			0
' beyond that , we must ensure that future teacher training addresses subject knowledge as well as education theory , ’ she said .			0

leading headmistress @entity13 warned extra training is not enough
