@entity0 believes pace does not matter in his quest to break back into @entity4 's test squad			1
the @entity6 seamer admitted he finds it ' baffling ' he faces criticism for not hitting the highly - prized 90mph mark , vowing to chase an @entity4 recall despite missing the @entity12 tour			1
the 26 - year - old was one of the few pluses of a dismal @entity16 run , and is now intent on forcing his way into the reckoning for next summer 's test challenges against @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity0 , pictured at the @entity6 photo call ahead of the county season , has vowed to regain his @entity4 place @entity0 hit back at those critics who say he should be hitting the 90mph mark with his bowling ' the frustrating thing is that i 've never been somebody who bowls 90 miles an hour for a whole day of cricket , that 's simply never happened in my career , ' said @entity0			1
' so it 's frustrating when people say ' you 've lost pace , you 've lost this , you 've lost that ' when i have n't			0
' maybe i bowled the odd spell up above 90 that i 'm working back towards , but consistently my paces have been the same as they have in the past			0
' but because there are other bowlers in the world who are bowling 95 miles an hour consistently , it 's like we 're searching for that , and it 's almost falling on my head			0
' it 's as though people are saying ' you 're the guy who 's done it for a few spells , so why are n't you doing it all the time ? '			0
' so it 's frustrating that people keep talking about that , because if you 're taking wickets , why does it matter if you 're bowling 87 or 93 miles an hour			0
@entity0 celebrates a wicket during @entity4 's @entity16 win over @entity63 back in february @entity0 , seen after taking five wickets in @entity4 's @entity16 warm - up over @entity66 , was a high point of the tour ' what does it matter ? you 're taking wickets			1
' so that to me is baffling and it 's silly to me , i find it stupid , but each to their own			2
' yes there might be a couple of extra miles an hour in there , as i 've always been searching for			0
' ever since i was 20 and came into international cricket i 've always been looking at how i am going to get better and make myself a member of the @entity4 team who is hard to be left out			1
' and that 's what i 'm working back towards , and i certainly feel i 'm on the way			0
' @entity86 - born @entity0 was sent home midway through @entity4 's disastrous @entity89 tour that ended in 5 - 0 defeat early last year			1
the pace bowler wrestled with his action for months , but has since hit back to form , and is now confident he can reach new heights and resurrect his @entity96 career			0
coach @entity97 overlooked @entity0 for the current three - @entity99 tour , but has told the @entity6 star he remains in @entity4 's plans			1
@entity0 fixes the hair of team - mate @entity103 as @entity6 posed for their traditional pre-season photograph @entity0 shares a joke with @entity106 as the team convened at @entity109 's ahead of the new county campaign ' i 've been told i 'm doing nothing wrong , but obviously to be left out of a tour obviously i am doing something wrong , ' said @entity0			1
' so again , all i can do , and this is what they said to me , is to go and take wickets , enjoy playing for @entity6 , and ' you 're very much in our thoughts '			2
' it 's reassuring for me to know that i 've not been totally discarded as @entity4 cricketer because that would frustrate me and anger me deeply because i still feel i 've got something to give to @entity125 cricket			2
' i 'm moving in the right direction , i feel like i 'm there and that i can compete in international cricket , because i did this winter			0
' and it 's just about finding that extra little bit that 's going to turn me from being a fringe player into someone who 's in the team			2
' that 's where i was a couple of years ago , i 'm not saying i 'm looking to the past : i do n't want to be the bowler i used to be , i want to be the bowler that i can be			0
' and if i do that i think i 've got a very good chance of being involved with @entity4			2
