all the world 's gold and platinum ore came from outer space after a mammoth meteorite shower battered the @entity6 more than four billion years ago , scientists revealed today			1
researchers also discovered there is enough gold and platinum in the @entity6 's core to plate the surface of the globe with a layer of priceless bling four metres thick			1
these huge gold deposits appeared during the @entity6 's formation when molten iron sank to its centre , dragging with it vast quantities of precious metals			1
rock on : gold and platinum arrived on @entity6 from space , claim scientists this left the @entity6 lacking gold and platinum until a cataclysmic meteor shower bombarded the earth 200 million years later			1
a staggering 20 billion billion tonnes of meteorite matter , including gold and platinum , slammed into the earth during the 200million - year - long shower			2
geologists at the @entity37 have discovered this mammoth meteorite shower replenished the earth 's lost reserves of precious metals			0
rock samples found in @entity42 - which were formed at the @entity6 's formation - contained a marginally higher ratio of the tungsten isotope @entity46 compared to more modern rock			1
therefore , modern rock must have come from a meteorite shower which proves today 's gold and platinum deposits came from outer space			1
spaced out : @entity23 arrived on @entity6 during a monster meteor shower lasting 200 million years dr @entity55 and professor @entity56 , of the @entity57 in the @entity58 , led the research			2
dr @entity55 said : ‘ extracting tungsten from the rock samples and analysing its isotopic composition to the precision required was extremely demanding given the small amount of tungsten available in rocks			0
‘ in fact , we are the first laboratory world - wide that has successfully made such high - quality measurements			0
‘ our work shows that most of the precious metals on which our economies and many key industrial processes are based have been added to our planet by lucky coincidence when the @entity6 was hit by about 20 billion billion tonnes of asteroidal material			2
’ the metals from these earth - shattering meteorites were stirred into the planet 's mantle by gigantic convection processes			0
these later emerged in newly formed continents , concentrated in the ore deposits which are mined today			0
the research , published in @entity87 , was funded by the @entity88 , the @entity89 and the @entity90 .			0

there 's enough gold and platinum on @entity6 for a *4m* - thick layer that covers the entire surface
