' ' the incentive is to commit sexual violence against women , then abuse or kill them to proceed or get ' god ' points – and now @entity2 are stocking it and promoting it for your @entity71 stocking , ' reads the petition			1
this book means that after various sex acts , readers are given options to kill women by stoning her unconscious , setting them on fire , cutting off their hands , and killing their children ! ' this misogynistic book literally makes a game of bashing , killing and horrific violence against women			1

' @entity148 claims that there is a significant amount of violence towards men throughout the game and believes women are in short supply			2
she said she was ' speechless ' as to why @entity7 had been specifically targeted and believes that parents who wo n't let their kids play the game , would probably be happy to give them permission to sit through an episode of @entity161 , or read a chapter from @entity163			2
' if i do n't like someone 's clothing , i 'm not going to ask the store to ban a certain type of shorts , ' she said			0

26 - year - old @entity148 believes big retailers such as @entity27 and @entity2 should not have to suffer financially due to this unjust petition			2
' i do n't know why gamers should be punished for something that 's not our fault , or the retailers fault because they 've gone through all the standards and checked the game , ' she said			1
