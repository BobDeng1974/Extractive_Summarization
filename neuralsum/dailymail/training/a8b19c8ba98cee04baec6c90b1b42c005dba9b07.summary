@entity0 is left in no doubt that the @entity2 can become as big as any other tournament in the footballing world			1
the 41 - year - old , speaking at @entity11 during the launch of his new autobiography ‘ @entity9 ’ , was forthright in his view that the @entity2 is capable of making an impact on the sport ’s landscape in years to come			1
@entity0 has a vested interest in its continued emergence after winning a bid to co-own @entity18 ’s @entity17 - the side to have landed former @entity21 goalkeeper @entity20 as both their coach and marquee player			1
@entity0 was speaking at the launch of his new autobiography ' @entity9 ' they also boast former @entity26 stalwarts @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
involvement in the business is something the @entity34 will continue to press ahead with after retiring from cricket this time last year			0
the franchise division has already attracted a host of other stars from across the globe - in a similar vein to cricket ’s @entity42			0
@entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 have all signed up for the inaugural campaign			1
@entity50 scores for @entity51 , and @entity0 believes the league can be huge in future ‘ internationally , football is really really big			2
in @entity55 we have all the potential to make football as big as anywhere else in the world , ’ he said			1
‘ football is definitely not as big as cricket in @entity55 , but i see it getting really big in times to come			2
the response to the @entity2 has been incredible			2
’ any new franchise is met with an air of scepticism - there are suggestions that older players want one last payday before calling time on their careers - but @entity0 is adamant that the sporting hunger of those in his homeland will see to it that football in @entity55 will thrive			1
the likes of @entity47 ( left ) and @entity44 are playing in the @entity2 and it ’s clear that a ringing endorsement from an individual so many in @entity55 worship because of his skills with the bat carries quite some weight			1
@entity0 - who notched more test runs and centuries than anyone else - was at the @entity88 on thursday to watch @entity89 beat @entity90			0
‘ i was in @entity89 yesterday [ thursday ] evening			0
i was asked a couple of questions and i could n’t hear the compere because the crowd was so loud			0
hundreds turned up at @entity96 in @entity97 on friday to greet the @entity99 cricketing legend ‘ the response has been really strong			0
people want to support football and its players in @entity55 - and make it a big sport			1
’ despite boasting a population over more than one billion , they have never qualified for a @entity106 and wo n’t be in @entity107 for january ’s @entity108 and lag behind other countries - notably @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
@entity0 sees the bigger picture , however , and hopes the start of the @entity2 will bring on a generation of younger players to begin challenging for tournament qualification			2
‘ its not going to happen overnight			0
it requires work from all directions , ’ he added			0
‘ that ’s what we are trying to do : support the players and give them a platform to realise their dreams			0
