but this time county chief @entity156 said everyone was ' alive and well '			0

' the back - to - back shootings in @entity14 on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper , @entity149 ( left ) and his 17 - year - old accomplice @entity150 ( right ) , terrorized the @entity148 area in a series of seemingly random shootings back - to - back shootings in @entity14 on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper terrorized the @entity148 area in a series of seemingly random shootings			1
ten people were killed and three injured in the october 14 shootings , which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem			2
@entity149 and his 17 - year - old accomplice @entity150 started their spree in february 2002 , with murders in @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			1
the cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured			0
it was only in october that they began to target the @entity200 and @entity14 areas immediately surrounding dc - earning the name the beltway sniper attacks			1
the attacks left @entity148 residents afraid to leave their houses for weeks			2
people would be shot at random and from a distance , so were never confronted with the attacker			0
but @entity149 apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a @entity213 card inscribed with the phrase ' call me @entity216 '			0
@entity149 and @entity150 's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on october 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in @entity222 , @entity14 and taken into custody			1
the following september , @entity149 went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death			0
his accomplice @entity150 testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed			0
when @entity150 went on trial , his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of @entity149 and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes , which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole			0
@entity149 was executed by lethal injection on november 10 , 2009 .			0
