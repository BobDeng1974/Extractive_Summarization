by @entity0 as the world was going about its business in july 2012 , a solar storm of epic proportions was speeding through @entity6 's orbit			1
researchers in @entity8 and @entity9 said a rapid succession of coronal mass ejections - intense eruptions on the @entity13 - that took place between 22 and 23 july caused a pulse of magnetised plasma to hurtle towards the planet			1
a study has now revealed that if these eruptions had taken place just nine days earlier , this solar blast would have smashed into @entity6 , potentially wiping out power supplies , phone signals and satellite communication			1
if these eruptions had taken place nine days earlier , the blast would have smashed into us , potentially wiping out power supplies researchers in @entity8 and @entity9 said a rapid succession of coronal mass ejections - intense eruptions on the sun - that took place in july 2012 caused a pulse of magnetised plasma to hurtle through @entity6 's orbit			1
the huge outburst on the sun , on 22 july , propelled a magnetic cloud through the solar wind at a peak speed of more than 1,242 miles per second ( 2,000 km / s )			1
this is four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm			0
it tore through @entity6 ’s orbit but , luckily , @entity6 and the other planets were on the other side of the sun at the time			1
if the eruptions had taken place nine days earlier , @entity6 would have been directly in line with the ignition spot on the sun. any planets in the line of sight would have suffered severe magnetic storms as the magnetic field of the outburst tangled with the planets ’ own magnetic fields			1
this has the potential to wipe out power supplies , phone signals and satellite communication			2
the researchers added @entity6 would have been ' enveloped in magnetic fireworks matching the largest magnetic storm ever reported on @entity6 , the so - called @entity73 event of 1859			1
' the 1859 storm was so strong , the @entity74 were said to be have been visible as far south as @entity76			0
the @entity74 predominantly appear in polar regions and are caused by the collision of energetic charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind			2
following the 1859 storm , telegraph services were disrupted worldwide			0
in a paper , published in the journal @entity86 , former @entity88 postdoctoral fellow and research physicist @entity89 , and @entity88 research physicist @entity83 reported their analysis of the magnetic storm , which was detected by @entity95 ’s @entity94 spacecraft			0
' had it hit @entity6 , it probably would have been like the big one in 1859 , but the effect today , with our modern technologies , would have been tremendous , ' said @entity83			2
a study last year estimated the cost of a solar storm could reach $ 2.6 trillion worldwide			2
this image was captured on 23 july 2012 by @entity95 's @entity94 spacecraft			1
it shows a coronal mass ejection leaving the sun at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per second ( 2,000 km / s ) - four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm			1
it tore through @entity6 's orbit but the planet was on other side of the sun at the time arcs of plasma are shown rising on the surface of the sun in this @entity95 image taken by the stereo spacecraft			1
the arcs are superheated matter made up of moving charged particles			0
most coronal mass ejections are more bulbous and wide , yet this is is quite narrow and contained in 1859 a solar storm known as the @entity127 , or @entity128 named after @entity73 who recorded it , saw numerous solar flares appear			1
from 28 august 28 to 2 september sunspots and solar flares were observed			2
@entity132 astronomer @entity73 observed the largest flare , which caused a major coronal mass ejection - a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic field - to travel directly toward @entity6			1
it was so strong that the @entity74 - a natural light display that appears predominantly in that @entity141 and @entity142 regions caused by the collision of energetic charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind - were said to be have been visible as far south as @entity76			0
telegraph services were also disrupted			0
' an extreme space weather storm - a solar superstorm - is a low - probability , high - consequence event that poses severe threats to critical infrastructures of the modern society , ' warned @entity89 , who now works at the @entity154 of the @entity155 in @entity156			0
' the cost of an extreme space weather event , if it hits @entity6 , could reach trillions of dollars with a potential recovery time of 4 - 10 years			1
' therefore , it is paramount to the security and economic interest of the modern society to understand solar superstorms			0
' based on their analysis of the 2012 event , @entity89 and @entity83 concluded that a huge outburst on the sun on 22 july propelled a magnetic cloud through the solar wind at a peak speed of more than 1,240 miles per second ( 2,000 km / s )			1
this is four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm			0

this diagram shows the route @entity95 's stereo spacecrafts take around the sun. @entity94 is made up of two observatories - one ahead of @entity6 in its orbit , @entity94 , and the other trailing behind , @entity94 scientists use the crafts to see the structure and evolution of solar storms as they blast from the sun during the sun 's cycle the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as @entity208 and @entity209			1
during @entity208 , solar activity is at its highest due to a flip , or reversal , of the sun 's magnetic field , illustration pictured			2
this causes the sun 's electromagnetic radiation to grows by around 0.1 % during the sun 's cycle , the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as @entity208 and @entity209			2
during @entity208 the amount of solar activity is at its highest due to a flip , or reversal , of the sun 's magnetic field			2
since 1976 there have been three @entity226 and they occur roughly every 11 years , although this can vary from between nine and 14 years			0
during a @entity208 , large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun 's irradiance - or electromagnetic radiation - output grows by around 0.1 per cent			0
this increase in energy can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns			0
' the authors believe this extreme event was due to the interaction of two @entity242 separated by only 10 to 15 minutes , ' said @entity243 , project scientist for @entity94 at @entity95 ’s @entity244			0
' people keep saying that these are rare natural hazards , but they are happening in the solar system even though we do n’t always see them , ' @entity83 added			0
' it ’s like with earthquakes - it is hard to impress upon people the importance of preparing unless you suffer a magnitude 9 earthquake			0
' the goal of @entity94 and other satellites probing the magnetic fields of the sun and @entity6 is to understand how and why the sun sends out these large solar storms and to be able to predict them during the sun ’s 11 - year solar cycle			1

during july 2012 , researchers witnessed a series of coronal mass ejections
these are intense eruptions which take place on the surface of the @entity13
the eruptions sent a pulse of magnetised plasma through @entity6 's orbit
if they had happened just nine days earlier , when @entity6 was *aligned* with the *location* of the eruptions , this plasma would have struck the planet
solar blasts have the potential to disable satellites and electricity grids
