there are moments when @entity2 sets off on those delayed runs in the bright red shirt of @entity5 and it all comes flooding back			1
this could have been just the start			0
he made his name with @entity11 , adding to his allure with those darting runs across opposition defences for @entity16 and @entity17 during five glorious years in @entity19 football			0
@entity20 away is a tough one to come into ; thrown into the team to start at the @entity24 leaders because @entity25 was short of bodies			1
@entity2 strikes for goal but his effort is thwarted by @entity20 goalkeeper @entity29 @entity2 competes for a high ball with @entity20 centre back @entity31 at @entity32 the @entity34 forward confronts @entity36 captain @entity35 after the pair got tangled on the ground he has yet to score against the top level @entity24 teams , with his meagre return coming in games against @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
there were a couple of notable chances here , with a left foot effort flying wide of @entity51 ’ left hand post and another , ten minutes later , which bounced back off his upright			0
it is sad to say but the knee injury he suffered in the build up to last summer ’s @entity59 , when he gamely tried to recover in time to play for @entity60 , has cost him that critical yard of pace			0
in his heart he must know that			0
the @entity5 forward was schooled here , denied space and room to breathe by the constant , intimidating presence of @entity20 ’s captain @entity35			1
@entity2 lost almost every key battle at @entity32			1
when it all gets a bit narky out there , as it did in the movement leading up to @entity20 ’s opening goal , which was scored by @entity76 after 38 minutes , @entity35 excels			1
@entity2 and @entity77 stand dejected on the half - way line following @entity76 's first - half strike for a man of his experience @entity2 should have been stronger , shielding the ball when he took a buffeting from @entity35 on the halfway line			1
seconds later , @entity20 had taken the lead			2
there was another skirmish before the break , a collision that ended with @entity35 jabbing his finger in @entity2 ’s face after they landed together in a crumpled heap			2
@entity35 was on top of him , taking the responsibility for marking the @entity5 forward away from his central defensive partner @entity31 for large sections of this clash			1
this central defensive pairing , with their constant communication , pass strikers over for fun these days			0
he looked like a man short of match fitness , the usual sharpness that is expected of a player in a game of this magnitude			0
this was a start , but @entity2 has been restricted to substitute appearances of late			2
@entity2 and @entity35 tangle once more as the @entity5 striker struggles to impose himself on the game he had just 19 touches in the first half , failing to take any of them in @entity20 ’s penalty area during a period when @entity121 ’s team were almost operating at full throttle			1
during sir @entity125 ’s era the club were blessed with great strikers , from @entity127 to @entity128 to @entity129			0
all of them pulled on the @entity5 shirt in their prime			2
@entity125 was here at @entity32 , watching this new team take shape under their @entity138 coach - and he will know that they are crying out for a fully fit forward			2
@entity2 is indifferent , short of confidence ( and goals ) after a frustrating eight months since his move on loan from @entity17 for the season was confirmed			1
he is crying out for help , desperate to roll back the years after spending so much of the season out of the picture			0
sadly , for a man of his stature , he is trading on memories now .			0
