@entity0 is the only woman to ever be ' awarded ' the @entity1 on the @entity3 frontline in 1869 , @entity0 risked her life to nurse soldiers hit by a deadly cholera outbreak back to health			1
as the only woman serving alongside the @entity8 in @entity9 , she saved more lives with her ‘ tender consolations ’ than a surgeon did with his medicines			1
her bravery and selfless devotion earned her an honorary @entity1 – making her the only woman to ever be ‘ awarded ’ the highest military honour in @entity18			0
with women ineligible to receive the @entity1 until 1921 , she was never officially recognised for her efforts			2
but her regiment were so struck by her ‘ indomitable pluck ’ that , after obtaining @entity25 @entity24 ’s special permission , they had a replica gold @entity1 made for her			1
and as no woman has been awarded the honour since 1921 , mrs @entity0 ’s unofficial medal makes her the only female recipient			1
the remarkable story of her life emerged in detail for the first time yesterday , as her gold medal is set to go on display at the @entity36 in @entity37 next month			1
speaking about her heroic efforts , lord @entity38 , who owns the medal , said : ‘ @entity0 was a remarkable woman who risked her own life to save others with her selfless devotion in nursing the sick			1
‘ she was both courageous and inspirational in the manner in which she dealt with a cholera outbreak in @entity3 in 1869			0
’ he added that the officers of the 104th @entity8 , who presented her with the replica , ‘ summed it up perfectly when they said the award was for her “ indomitable pluck ” ’			2
born in @entity55 in 1834 , she married @entity56 , a captain in the 2nd @entity8 – later renamed the 104th – in 1859			0
women were ineligible for the @entity1 until 1921 , but @entity25 @entity59 gave permission for a gold replica to be made for mrs @entity0 to reward her for her ‘ indomitable pluck ' in october 1868 , the newly - promoted @entity62 @entity56 took the 104th to @entity9 , having anticipated trouble on @entity3 ’s north - west frontier			1
however , in 1869 cholera swept @entity3 and by august the soldiers were infected			0
on september 17 part of the regiment went to a temporary camp in the countryside , with the remaining soldiers joining them five days later			0
by then , many soldiers and their families had already died from the disease and mrs @entity0 was the only woman to go with them			2
in her mid- 30s at the time , she spent three months nursing the sick and keeping up their spirits , moving through the baking @entity3 countryside to take care of the regiment as they moved stations			0
mrs @entity0 ( gravestone pictured ) spent three months nursing soldiers with cholera and keeping up an @entity89 regiment 's spirits even with her own life in danger , mrs @entity0 did not stop her efforts to help the men beat the disease			1
one night she was attacked by two tribesmen who seized her horse in an incident she described as ‘ alarming ’			0
when the regiment finally returned to @entity9 , she said : ‘ i was treated as a heroine ’			0
at a regimental dinner in 1869 , one member of the 104th said : ‘ @entity103 declared that by her energies and tender consolations , she had been the instrument of preserving more lives than he had been able to save with his medicines			0
’ her husband added : ‘ none of those who were with the regiment during that awful cholera season in 1869 will ever forget mrs @entity0 ’s devotion to the sick			2
’ in june 1921 a magazine article said : ‘ throughout their trying time in the isolation camp mrs @entity0 remained with the regiment and it was largely owing to her indefatigable exertions that the losses of the regiment were not infinitely heavier than they were			2
’ the 104th officers felt mrs @entity0 had lived up to the traditions of the @entity1 and in 1869 she was awarded with the honorary medal			1
a letter to the @entity128 stated : ‘ it is said that it was suggested to @entity25 @entity24 that mrs @entity0 might be given the @entity1 , but this was , of course , not possible , so the gold replica was made and presented to her instead			1
’ mrs @entity0 later wrote : ‘ it is a most beautiful ornament , and will always be my most cherished possession			2
’ she died in @entity37 in 1917			0
her medal will be displayed at the @entity36 from next month in celebration of @entity137 , which was held on sunday .			0
