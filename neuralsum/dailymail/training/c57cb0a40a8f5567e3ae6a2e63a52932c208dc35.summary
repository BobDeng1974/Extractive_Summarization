by @entity0 last updated at 3:35 pm on 29th july 2011 a former @entity2 activist has admitted he may have inspired @entity4 gunman @entity3			1
@entity5 said his @entity7 blog entitled @entity8 could have helped inform @entity3 's exhaustive 1,500 page manifesto in which he justifies the atrocities			1
but he condemned the murder of 76 people in twin attacks in @entity14 and @entity15 on friday as an act of ' pure evil			0
' rant : @entity20 extremist @entity5 quotes from a @entity21 as he discusses why prince @entity22 should fight the ' invasion ' of @entity24 from his self - imposed ' exile ' in @entity26 mr @entity5 , 35 , told @entity27 : ' i am being implicated as his ( @entity3 's ) mentor			1
i definitely could have been his inspiration			0
but what he did was pure evil			0
' i could never use what he has done to further my own beliefs			0
what he has done does not equate to anything i am involved in			0
' it has been widely reported that @entity3 made postings on @entity20 nationalist websites and in the manifesto released before the attacks he refers to a ' mentor '			1
parallels have since been drawn with blogger mr @entity5 , who leads an @entity50 movement , but he vociferously denies having anything to do with the attacks			1
the former @entity2 member , who calls himself ' lionheart ' , left the @entity20 to live in @entity26 in 2008 after being arrested over internet postings allegedly inciting racial hatred			1
mr @entity5 's extremist views call for prince @entity22 to answer his ' destiny ' and ' defend ' his country against the ' modern invasion ' of @entity24			1
he took to his blog to further himself from @entity61 , insisting : ' i might be a @entity63 fundamentalist who has a deep dislike for @entity67 fundamentalism who looks to @entity69 as an example			2
former @entity2 member @entity5 insists that he has ' nothing to hide ' and has branded @entity3 's actions as ' pure evil ' denial : mr @entity5 says gunman @entity3 , pictured , may have been inspired by him , but he does not condone the mass murders ' but anyone who knows me knows that i personally would play no part in such inhumane savagery that has no place in the civilised world			1
' my mind can not comprehend the mass murder inflicted upon the people of @entity4 , even though i am forced to confront the reality of it due to the fact that i have been implicated in the story surrounding it			0
' why this man could have based key bits of his manifesto on myself and others i am connected with is something i am sure the police are now trying to work out as they wonder whether we are involved with any of these ‘ figment of his imagination ’ cells based upon our belief in true @entity69 and our political beliefs			0
' in an earlier interview with website @entity106 before the @entity108 , he ranted that he lived in ' exile ' for his beliefs and how @entity111 was inevitable between @entity112 and @entity24 , which chimes with @entity3 's islamaphobic rants			1
he said : ' there 's an influx , an invasion of @entity24 from the @entity117 and from all around the world , coming into our countries			1
the former @entity2 member then bizarrely said that prince @entity22 was the 1,000th knight of the garter and should take after @entity123			1
' now more than ever we need to have a @entity123			0
and i believe prince @entity22 has to embrace the calling and divine destiny that 's been given to him to assume that role			1
' in the interview , he said @entity129 ' @entity22 and @entity130 were ' prepared ' for war against @entity24			1
' they have a grasp of the enemy we 're now facing			0
' bizarre : @entity5 , right , walks with @entity137 right winger @entity136 in @entity26 , while he discusses ' @entity111 ' and how there has been an ' invasion ' of @entity24 before launching his attacks , which killed a total of 76 people , @entity3 wrote of his allegiance to the @entity50 - which he described as a secret society created to carry out a crusade against @entity67 in @entity146			1
in his manifesto , @entity3 claimed the group was created at a meeting in @entity150 in 2002 and he was mentored by a man called ' @entity152 ) '			2
the medieval @entity50 was a @entity63 military order founded in the early 12th century whose members , wearing white mantles with a red cross , became one of the most formidable fighting forces of the @entity160			2
the crusades were a series of religiously sanctioned military campaigns , called by the pope and waged by kings and nobles			0
they volunteered to take up the cross with the main goal of recapturing @entity170 and the @entity171 from @entity24 rule and restoring @entity63 control			2
it was dissolved in 1312			0
but in a separate interview with the @entity176 mr @entity5 flatly denied having anything to do with the gunman and said : ' i just want the truth to come out and it proven that i 'm nothing whatever to do with this			2
' mr @entity5 's comments came after @entity4 's domestic intelligence chief said there was no evidence of links between @entity3 , 32 , and the @entity187 far - right			1
@entity189 , director of the @entity190 , said yesterday : ' i can tell you , at this moment in time , we do n't have evidence or we do n't have indications that he has been part of a broader movement or that he has been in connection with other cells or that there are other cells			2
' the intelligence chief told the @entity202 she did not believe the killer was insane , but calculating and evil , and someone who sought the limelight			0
@entity208 counter-terrorism officials attended an emergency meeting in @entity210 yesterday and warned that radicals who share @entity3 's ideology could be tempted to follow his lead			1
' clearly , one major risk is that somebody may actually try to mount a similar attack as a copycat attack or as a way of showing support , ' said @entity220 , a counter-terrorism adviser			0
@entity208 interior ministers are to meet to discuss responses to the @entity4 massacre in september			0
meanwhile , @entity4 police are due to question @entity3 for the second time today in relation to information that has emerged over the past few days , according to reports			2
@entity3 has admitted setting off a car bomb in the government district of @entity14 , killing at least eight people , and carrying out a shooting spree at the ruling @entity234 's annual youth camp on nearby @entity15 island , where 68 people died			2
however , he denies criminal responsibility and has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces			0
@entity4 officials last night released the names of another 24 victims and more are expected over the coming days .			0
