ms @entity0 desperately tried to free @entity1 , along with the help of passer - by @entity16 , who came to her aid when he noticed her in a distressed state			1
however , their attempts to free the animal with a spade failed , and mr @entity16 phoned his wife @entity23 for help			2

within 30 minutes of her status update , about 20 people had turned up at the scene , armed with torches , spades and pick axes			1
one person even took a powerful light on a tripod			0

' she said : ' i have been past the hole before and my little dog has never attempted to go in			2
' i do n't know why she went down this time but she did			0
' she came out backwards and i tried to get hold of her legs but she yelped and went back in further			0
' i was just hanging around for about an hour hoping she would come out			0
' @entity1 kept crying and whimpering , she 's normally a very quiet dog			1
it was quite frightening because i felt so helpless			0
' ms @entity0 said she had been out walking both @entity1 , and her friend 's labradoodle @entity57 , when the incident occurred			1
after initial attempts to free her dog failed , she returned home to try and call the @entity62 for help , but she said they told her rescuers could n't help because it was dark			1
she added : ' i had to get back because my friend was expecting her dog back and i do n't have a mobile phone but i was so worried about leaving her there			2

the helpers dug a trench ( left ) to free @entity1 ( right ) from the deep hole the volunteers , including some off - duty firemen , spent about four hours digging a four - foot deep trench to free the frightened pet			1

' i went back to the field and just did n't know what to do			0
then this very kind gentleman came past with his dog			2
' he called someone and very quickly an enormous amount of people came out of the woodwork			2
one girl even came out in a giraffe - print onesie			0
' somebody brought a tripod with a light on it and suddenly there were torches , spades and pick axes			0
two of the men were off - duty firemen and were very helpful			0
' they were digging around where they thought she was and they literally sort of hand - dug her out			0
' it was about four foot deep and when she came out her fur was covered in beads of rolled up mud			0
' it took me ages to wash it all out and she shook mud all over the bathroom , but i 'm so relieved to have her back			0
ms @entity0 said it took her ages to get all of the mud off her beloved dog , who was uninjured in the ordeal the pensioner said : ' @entity1 is very special to me and i am extremely grateful to all those people who helped ' ' i do n't have the internet and @entity141 and these things are all alien to me but it just goes to show you the power of social media			1
' it 's an example of the great @entity45 public really being great			0
' @entity1 is very special to me and i am extremely grateful to all those people			2
' mrs @entity150 , a 50 - year - old school dinner lady , said she put out a plea for volunteers on @entity12 after her husband - a managing director of a company which designs and produces baby products â€“ phoned for help			2
she said : ' my husband rang me and asked me to bring him a spade to the field which is about a mile away			0
' after an hour he called again and said could i try to get some muscle power up there because he could n't do it on his own			0
' i did n't know what to do so i asked people to help on my @entity12 status and it worked , within half - an - hour 20 people had turned up there			1
