a crash victim who lost part of his leg and was left unable to walk is set to become the first in the @entity4 to have his limb rebuilt by surgeons - using donor bones			1
@entity8 was thrown from his motorbike in 2011			1
he lost chunks of his thigh bone and his calf bone , as well as all his knee ligaments , when he skidded across the road			0
doctors feared the 29 - year - old would lose the mangled right limb but after a series of 10 - hour operations they managed to save it			1
however , mr @entity8 - who was previously a landscape gardener and martial arts competitor - was left wheelchair bound and suffering extreme pain			1
four years on he still struggles to walk unaided and has been unable to work			1
but he is now preparing himself for a life - changing reconstruction , which will see surgeons screw parts of a donor leg on to what remains of his limb			1
surgeons will screw parts of a donor leg on to the remains of his limb , to restore stability in his knee this is the first time that a knee with attached femur ( thigh bone ) , fibula ( calf bone ) and ligaments from a deceased donor will be transplanted in an operation			1
doctors will bolt them on to mr @entity8 's remaining leg bones , and after two years it will integrate to his leg			1
he hopes it will allow him to run again mr @entity8 lost chunks of his thigh bone and his calf bone , as well as all his knee ligaments , when he skidded across the road			1
doctors feared he would lose his mangled right limb but after a series of 10 - hour operations they managed to save it mr @entity8 , from @entity66 , @entity67 , said : ' as far as i 'm aware this is the first time they are going to do it on this scale in this country so i 'm a bit of a guinea pig			1
' i do n't mind because it will work for me and hopefully it will restore some sort of strength and stability in my knee , which is the ultimate goal			0
' they want to take the femur , the ligaments and a bit of the fibula - all attached - and then bolt them on to my leg , and hopefully over two years it will integrate to my leg			2
' that is obviously a huge , huge operation and i 've been on a donor list for the last three years			2
it 's a big thing to deal with			2
' i 'd love to find out who this donor is or his family and just sent them a letter to say thank you			2
' they 've literally given me bones and bits of body			2
' the thought that some young bloke died somewhere and that i 'm having a bit of his leg , it 's a weird concept - but an amazing one			2
' the consultant surgeon who will be carrying out the landmark operation on mr @entity8 said he did not think it had been performed before in the @entity4			1
mr @entity8 was knocked off his motorbike in 2011 and was left left wheelchair - bound and in extreme pain			1
four years later , he is still unable to walk unaided			1
he is pictured at his home in @entity67 surgeon @entity113 said : ' we believe it is the first application of this technique in this setting			2
' he said the operation - known as an allograft knee replacement - requires the correct size donor knee , which has been sourced through the @entity122			0
mr. @entity113 said the complex operation will involve using parts of the donor 's knee , tibia , femur and proximal fibula , along with associated ligaments and cartilage			1
a team of plastic surgeons , trauma surgeons and knee surgeons will carry it out			0
the @entity122 uses bone donated by living and deceased donors to help patients needing grafts			0
people undergoing hip replacements may be asked to donate bone removed during the procedure			0
but for patients such as @entity8 – who need a large amount for a reconstructive operation – the bone will have to come from an organ donor			1
the bone will have been disinfected , tested for viruses and stored in a tissue bank			0
it can be stored for up to five years , and there are no age restrictions for anyone wanting to donate bone after death			0
surgeons use donor bone to form scaffolding , with pins , plates or screws holding the graft tissue in place on the damaged limb			2
once accepted by the patient ’s body , the grafted bone provides a framework where new , living bone can grow			0
mr @entity8 was riding to @entity174 for a day out with his family when he was knocked off his motorbike in @entity67 in april 2011			1
he was taken to @entity177 and then transferred to @entity179 's @entity178 where surgeons warned there was a high chance he would lose his leg			1
doctors took skin , tissue and muscle from his side and back to patch up his leg , which was only just supplying blood to his foot by a single vein			2
he recalled : ' it ripped all the skin off my leg and i went down the road on my knee which ground away a lot			0
' they planted tissue from my back down into my leg and plumbed in all in amazingly			0
' it was three surgeries and two of them were ten or 11 hours long			0
' it was pretty intense			0
i think i had 10 to 11 units of blood replaced			0
' mr @entity8 got the call from the @entity122 in november telling him a suitable leg donor had been found , and the operation will take place in february			1
doctors will implant one third of the anonymous donor 's knee joint - made up of bits of thigh bone , calf bone and ligaments - together with artificial cartilage			2
' when they told me they had a suitable donor i did get emotional , ' mr @entity8 said			1
i felt all over the place			0
i did n't know what to think			0
' i 'm going to have to keep mentally strong - for my family and friends as well			0
doctors took skin , tissue and muscle from mr @entity8 's side and back to patch up his leg , which was supplying blood to his foot by a single vein			1
he is pictured in hospital , left and right , after the procedure mr @entity8 was riding to @entity174 for a day out with his family when he was knocked off his motorbike ( pictured ) in @entity67 ' i want to be able to run again			1
' going through it has been hard , of course , but there are people in worse places than me			0
i have to stay positive			0
' the @entity247 authority said it believed @entity8 's operation would be the first of its kind to take place in the @entity4			1
a spokesman from @entity247 said : ' @entity247 's @entity253 is the only tissue bank in the @entity4 that operates from initial donor referral through to the hospitals who use the donated tissue to save and improve patients ' lives			2
' we provide life enhancing tissues to hospitals up and down the country			0
these include specially requested grafts , to meet the unique requirements of an individual patient			0
' as far as we are aware this is the first time that a knee with attached femur , fibula and ligaments from a deceased donor has been supplied in the @entity4 for this novel operation			0
' we rely on the generosity of the families of people who donate their tissues after death			0
thanks to them we are able to provide skin , tendons , bone and other tissues to repair or rebuild the bodies and lives of thousands of severely injured people every year			0
' we wish mr @entity8 well with his operation and hope he makes a speedy recovery			1

@entity8 , 29 , was knocked off his motorbike in @entity67 in 2011
doctors feared he would lose his right leg but they managed to save it
he was left unable to walk unaided and had to give up his *job*
now surgeons will screw parts of a donor leg on to his remaining limb
it could take up to two years for the donor bones to fuse with mr @entity8 's
' when they told me they had a suitable donor i did get emotional , ' he said
