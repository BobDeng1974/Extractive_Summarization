a @entity1 school board may change a policy allowing groups to distribute religious materials in high schools after a satanic worship group has asked to distribute coloring books about their faith			1

a spokesperson for @entity15 says that they should be able to hand out coloring books that feature children performing satanic rituals and drawing pentagrams just like any other religious group			1
the content in the coloring books are puzzles that ask children to search for words like , empathy , love , care , and friendship			0
another typical page of the coloring book shows a young girl named @entity50 who is ' spreading knowledge and helping to dispel fear and ignorance by demonstrating her satanic ritual for her class			1
' the satanic group is not the only one that hands out materials , either			0
an evangelical group called @entity60 of @entity1 has given out bibles in @entity63 schools three times , reports @entity65			1

cartoons : each page of the coloring book aims at teaching people the truth about satanic worship that believers feel are misconstrued evil ? : the book contains activities in which students are asked to find words like love and care ' they seem to be moving against the interests of a large part of the community , ' said @entity87 of @entity1 @entity88 of the @entity90 's desire to hand out material			1
' the @entity92 will open somebody 's heart , somebody 's mind , and cause them to pursue answers			0

' given that there 's a potential change in the policy , we wo n't be allowing distribution , ' @entity66 said			0
' we 're going to wait			0
