' at the time the bar was packed and all the customers were looking over at us to see what all the commotion was about			0
we felt we had no choice but to leave because it was so embarrassing			0
i appreciate a bar ’s management reserve the right not to serve customers but obviously i was n’t drunk or misbehaving or under 18 - so he had no reason not to serve me			2
' i am not some @entity74 - type binge drinker			0
i have done extensive research on the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant and the fact is there ’s nothing wrong with having a small glass of wine every week			1
' i have enjoyed a small glass of red wine with a meal once a week throughout my pregnancy but it ’s not been every week			1
' i would describe myself as health - conscious			0
i have run two marathons in the past and i am not into filling my body with anything that should n’t be there			0
' when you look at how much of an issue excess alcohol causes in this country , i really do n’t feel that any establishment that chooses to profit from alcohol sales is in any position to judge anyone			0
' the incident occurred after @entity31 decided to take a long walk with mr @entity32 around @entity3 ’s @entity104 on tuesday night			1
after their stroll the couple , who have been together for 10 months , headed to nearby @entity2 bar			0
research : miss @entity0 , who describes herself as health - conscious , said she has done ' extensive research on the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant ' miss @entity0 , who works as an intermediary business manager for @entity15 and also runs her own website selling eco-friendly soaps and cosmetics , said : ' i asked the barman for a small glass of red wine and as soon as i said it i could see him pursing his lips as if taking a sharp intake of breath			1
' i went to the toilet leaving @entity32 at the bar and when i came back the barman came up to me and said he would n’t serve me because he could n’t have serving a pregnant woman alcohol on his conscience			1
it was outrageous and embarrassing			0

' i do n’t even use normal deodorant because i am concerned about using environmentally friendly and ethical products			0
' i have read numerous articles about the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant and i believe one small glass of wine once a week is not harmful to me or my baby			1
' i had no alcohol during first 12 weeks of pregnancy apart from one glass of bubbly and one wine in that 12 week period and then , at most one glass a week , but not every week			1
' it was usually with a nice meal out or on the odd occasion , like that tuesday just after as long - a - walk as i could manage			2
the barman who refused to serve me was only in his 20s			2
it ’s not up to him to decide what i should and should n’t be putting in my body			0

source : @entity191 ' i felt like asking whether he refuses to serve fat people pies , or whether the bar checks how much caffeine a woman has consumed that day before they serve her a cup of coffee			2
' there is recent research that suggests baldness is linked to alcohol consumption , are they going to start measuring people ’s hairlines before they serve them a pint ? ' @entity210 , area manager of @entity211 , described the incident as an ' unfortunate misunderstanding '			2
he said : ' i would first and foremost like to apologise to ms @entity0 for any upset or embarrassment caused			1
' i can fully understand her grievances and can completely understand why she felt upset			0
' i would like to state that we have no company policy on the serving or not serving of alcohol to pregnant people			2
why would we ? it ’s none of our business			0
' what occurred was simply the result of a junior member of staff making a mistake and getting his wires crossed			0
' he is deeply sorry for upsetting ms @entity0 and assures me that he was not , as i fear she believes , making a judgment on her , but rather thought for some reason , despite his training , that licensing laws forbade the serving of alcohol to pregnant people			1
' however i can understand , given the unfortunate way he appears to have said it , why ms @entity0 felt he was insinuating otherwise			0
i would very much like to get in contact with ms @entity0 to apologise directly			0
