@entity2 stuck his teeth into @entity0 a day after he grilled prime minister @entity9 about the axed carbon tax and federal budget , saying : ‘ no one is buying what you are selling , what you are laying down			1
’ ' the reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse , ’ he told the @entity9 , as it was revealed @entity9 ’s popularity has fallen			2
@entity0 appeared on the @entity3 to discuss his unpopular higher education reforms as the government vowed it will launch a second attempt to pass them despite a @entity28 defeat on tuesday			1
’ ‘ here ’s the issue you ca n’t get your own policies through the @entity28 - and yes it ’s hostile - but you ca n’t even get it through your own people , ’ @entity2 laughed			1
‘ that ’s not right @entity2 … i ’m not in the least bit dismayed … my view is that ’s democracy … this morning i am bouncing back and puting up a new reform bill , ’ @entity0 said			1
on tuesday night @entity0 was forced to deny that he ‘ harassed ’ senators in order to get them to support his higher education reforms , insisting that he holds an ' excellent relationship ' with the @entity28 's crossbenchers			1
@entity0 commented on the government 's higher education reform , after it was voted down in the @entity28 @entity59 senator @entity58 speaks in the @entity28 chamber at @entity33 in @entity34 , tuesday @entity59 senator @entity58 accused the education minister of pestering him and others in a statement , saying he 'd been ' inundated with text messages from @entity31 ' despite having never given him his mobile number			1
but mr @entity0 dismissed the accusations , suggesting that the ' seven or eight ' messages he 'd sent senator @entity58 were entirely acceptable and telling @entity71 's @entity70 that he would be ' happy to send him more '			1
asking him about the allegations , @entity2 jibed : ‘ he ’s a newly minted senator with virtually no experience , he was mocking you			0
’ @entity0 vowed he will bounce back and propose a new version of the @entity77 reforms he denied he was being blackmailed when @entity78 probed him about senators who did not vote for his reforms ‘ that ’s a matter for @entity82			2
i intend to have a great relationship with him , ’ @entity0 replied			0
announcing : ‘ today we ’ll introduce a new higher education reform bill that picks up a lot of the issues that were raised by the crossbenchers , none by @entity91 or the @entity92 they are just saying “ no ” and are not part of the debate at all			1
’ ‘ whose fault is it that the bill was rejected ? , ’ @entity2 asked			2
‘ well the crossbenchers , the @entity100 and the @entity92 did n’t vote for it – four of the crossbenches did … great reform takes time , there is an inevitability about it because it ’s great for our universities and students , ’ @entity0 said			2
@entity2 continued his offence : ‘ ultimately you ’ve got massive dramas getting any bill passed do you think that the senators are holding the country to ransom at the moment – are they blackmailing the country ? ’ the prime minister appeared on @entity117 's today show on tuesday morning and faced a barrage of questions from host @entity2 over his controversial budget decisions avoiding answering the question , @entity0 said : ‘ as i see this , it is round two			1
as i said to @entity124 if it loses the first time it will be like losing the first test of a five test series			0
’ ‘ they are blackmailing you in a way though are n’t they ? , ’ @entity2 retorted			0
‘ i would n’t say that , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ i think the @entity9 said something like that yesterday “ this is a form of blackmail ” , ’ @entity2 reasoned			2
‘ i think he was saying … voting no in the @entity28 because you ca n’t have your way on one particular thing is not the way to negotiate with the government or with anybody , ’ @entity0 said			1
@entity2 finished : ‘ why do n’t you just double dissolution , man up and get on with it ? ‘ we ’ve had a great year , ’ @entity0 replied			2
education minister @entity31 has denied that he was ' harassing ' @entity59 senator @entity58 in order to gain his support for his higher education reforms package the @entity9 government will have another go at overhauling universities , defying defeat and bringing a new - look bill before parliament			1
@entity0 will on wednesday introduce a redrafted bill to deregulate universities , after the @entity28 knocked back the first attempt on tuesday			1
despite pleading with crossbench senators , the government failed to convince enough to jump on board the policy			0
the government will have to work on the @entity59 , @entity166 and @entity167 to get the new bill through the @entity28 early next year			0
the redrafted bill will include other crossbench amendments that dump plans to increase interest rates on hecs and freeze interest charges while new parents take time out to raise kids			0
it will also include a scholarship fund targeted towards disadvantaged and rural students			0
on tuesday @entity0 also made an ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher @entity181 while insisting he had an ' excellent relationship ' with him - a mistake that was quickly pointed out by @entity71 reporter @entity185			0
@entity71 journalist @entity185 , pointed mr @entity0 's ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher @entity188 ' well some people pronounce it @entity181 , some people pronounce it @entity193 ; it depends where you are on the spectrum			2
but if you wish to pick me up on that @entity185 , that 's a very small thing and i 'm surprised you 'd bother with it			0
never the less , @entity202 and i are good friends and i will continue to try and get their support , ' he replied to the quip			0
clearly put - off by the slip , mr @entity0 then scolded ms sales , instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers and the quality of the relationships they shared			1
' i have met with some of the crossbenchers many , many times – in fact i 've met with some of them six or seven or eight times , but i 'm not going to go through the day - to - day machinations of how government works , @entity185 , ' he said			0
' you can go and study that at university if you wish to , in a bachelor of political science			0
the reality is that i 'm working closely with the cross bench , i secured four of their votes today and i 'll be back at it again tomorrow with a new reform bill			0
