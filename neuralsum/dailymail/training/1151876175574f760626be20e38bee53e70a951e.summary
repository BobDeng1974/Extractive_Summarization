by @entity0 published : 06:40 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 07:09 est , 12 july 2012 ballet thriller @entity1 received the most complaints in 2011 in large part because of its lesbian sex scene , the @entity6 's ratings body has revealed			1
the film generated 40 objections to the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , most of whom took a dislike to the raunchy interactions between @entity14 as @entity15 and fellow dancer @entity16 , played by @entity17			1
some described the scene as ' pornographic ' , but the @entity11 said it came within the bounds of the film 's 15 rating			2
' pornographic ' : this lesbian scene between @entity14 as @entity15 and @entity17 as @entity16 made @entity1 the most complained - about film of 2011 , according to the @entity6 ratings body 's annual report disconnect : the @entity11 said other viewers complained that they had expected to see a film about ballet rather than ' the story of a young woman 's mental disintegration ' ' while the scene is visually discreet , narratively justified and within the 15 guidelines criteria , some correspondents felt it was pornographic in nature , ' it said in its annual report			1
' that it was a sex scene between two women was an aggravating factor for some who argued that portrayals of homosexual activity should either be restricted to the 18 category , or not shown at all			0
' others complained that they had ' expected to see a film about ballet rather than the story of a young woman 's mental disintegration ' , the @entity11 said its annual report			1
the @entity11 added : ' the high number of complaints for @entity1 demonstrates the disconnect that sometimes occurs between a viewer 's expectations of a film and its actual content			2
' ' @entity58 ' : @entity59 ( above ) , which features a genetically engineered ' super-soldier ' , received 29 complaints , the second - highest for 2011 , over its perceived ' sadistic violence ' ' too raunchy ' : @entity65 ( pictured ) , which charts the fantasies of a young woman committed to a mental institution , was condemned by 15 viewers for its sexual suggestiveness but it said the number of complaints was far fewer than the 120 generated by horror @entity74 this year because of its @entity11 rating			1
the report was released as the @entity11 announced it had commissioned major research into public perceptions of sexual violence in films - the first for ten years			1
the film generating the second - highest number of complaints last year was @entity59 , which features a genetically engineered ' super soldier '			2
it received 29 objections from viewers who found the violence ' sadistic and gratuitous '			0
the @entity90 : breaking @entity91 1 garnered 16 complaints because of the storyline where heroine @entity94 and her vampire lover @entity95 , played by @entity96 , marry and consummate their relationship			0
objections : @entity96 as vampire @entity95 and @entity100 as his lover @entity94 in @entity90 : breaking @entity102 - part 1 , which generated 16 complaints from viewers @entity65 , which charts the fantasies of a young woman committed to a mental institution , was condemned by 15 viewers for its sexual suggestiveness and threats targeted at female characters			1
the @entity11 said it refused to grant a certificate for @entity112 ( @entity113 ) because of its horrific plot where a man achieves sexual gratification from the stapling together of victims to form a human centipede			0
but it was later rated 18 after editing			0
the @entity122 - which sees a truck driver abduct and sexually abuse and tortures a prostitute - was refused a certificate			0
it was as a result of those two films that the @entity11 decided to commission new research into ' depictions of sadistic , sexual and sexualised violence , mainly against women '			2
the body said it wanted to determine what the @entity6 public today believes is potentially harmful and therefore unacceptable for classification			0
the research will be completed later this year .			0
