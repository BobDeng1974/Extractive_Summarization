a drug that may reverse autism is to be tested on children with the condition for the first time , scientists have revealed			1
preliminary results show that the drug called suramin , which is already used to treat sleeping sickness in @entity10 , corrects autism - like symptoms in mice			1
at the molecular level , it normalises faulty brain connections , cell - to - cell signalling , and metabolic effects thought to underlie the disorder			2
groundbreaking : testing of the drug suramin on mice in @entity22 has found it can help to correct autism - like symptoms ( stock image ) the drug targets a cell messaging system that produces a metabolic response to stress			1
according to a new theory , autism is strongly linked to this pathway , known as purinergic signalling			2
scientists in the @entity22 found that the drug corrected 17 types of abnormality linked to autism in genetically modified mice , including social behaviour problems			1
autism is a wide ranging condition , mostly seen in boys , that affects a person 's ability to socialise and communicate and can have a devastating lifelong impact			2
around 600,000 children and adults in the @entity44 are thought to have the disorder			0
professor @entity46 , co-director of the @entity47 and @entity48 at the @entity49 in @entity50 , said : ' our theory suggests that autism happens because cells get stuck in a defensive metabolic mode and fail to talk to each other normally , which can interfere with brain development and function			0
' we used a class of drugs that has been around for almost a century to treat other diseases to block the ' danger ' signal in a mouse model , allowing cells to return to normal metabolism and restore cell communication			0
' new hope : a small clinical trial on children could be carried out within the year at the @entity47 and @entity48 at the @entity49 in @entity50 , pictured he added : ' of course , correcting abnormalities in a mouse is a long way from a cure for humans			1
but we are encouraged enough to test this approach in a small clinical trial of children with autism spectrum disorder in the coming year			1
' this trial is still in the early stages of development			0
we think this approach , called antipurinergic therapy or @entity86 , offers a fresh and exciting new path that could lead to development of a new class of drugs to treat autism			2
' the findings are published in the online journal @entity94			0
professor @entity46 and his team believe both genetic and environmental causes of autism can be traced to a sustained cell danger response linked to immunity and inflammation			0
' when cells are exposed to classical forms of dangers such as a virus , infection or toxic environmental substance , a defence mechanism is activated , ' said the professor			0
' this results in changes to metabolism and gene expression ( activity ) and reduces the communication between neighbouring cells			0
simply put , when cells stop talking to each other , children stop talking			0
' @entity120 is an inhibitor of purinergic signalling that has been used to treat @entity10 sleeping sickness since shortly after it was first synthesised in 1916			1
the ' striking effectiveness ' of the drug in mice could pave the way to a ' completely new class of anti-inflammatory drugs to treat autism and other disorders ' , said professor @entity46 .			1
