eight days is a long time in rugby and @entity1 showed on saturday that they had put last friday ’s crushing defeat by @entity3 behind them with a performance which occasionally hinted at a return to their best			1
@entity8 ’s men were slow out of the blocks before hitting their straps midway through the second half to ease home with something to spare			0
@entity15 ’s 80th - minute try for the visitors put some gloss on the scoreboard and secured a losing bonus - point , but @entity1 had this match wrapped up from the moment @entity22 powered over for a try midway through the second half			1
@entity22 ( r ) glides past @entity25 's @entity24 to score a try for @entity1 @entity27 of @entity1 scores a try during their 28 - 21 victory over @entity25 ‘ i thought we bounced back really well , ’ said @entity1 director of rugby @entity8			1
‘ when you lose like that to @entity3 the important thing to understand is why you were beaten and why you did n’t get the performance you wanted			0
‘ it ’s important not to overreact or under - react and get to the nub of the problem			2
i think we ’ve been ok at doing that over the past couple of seasons			0
’ the game was always engaging and , with the artificial @entity45 pitch set to stand up to whatever the @entity47 winter throws at it , @entity1 fans can expect more good - quality rugby as the season progresses			1
in the week that @entity54 confirmed their intention to move to @entity56 , last season ’s beaten @entity52 finalists attracted more than 9,000 fans to a ground they purchased just two years ago			2
as the only remaining @entity52 club with a @entity62 postcode , @entity1 ’ marketing men are already licking their lips at the prospect of luring in a tranche of disillusioned @entity54 fans ready to consume regular top - flight rugby but unwilling to travel a 150 - mile round trip in order to do so			1
for the time being , @entity1 will refrain from making overtures towards the disaffected but the intention is to move in on their rival ’s former territory			2
‘ how long do you have to wait after someone has died until you can ask to buy the contents of their wardrobe ? ’ one source asked before kick - off			2
@entity25 's @entity15 dives in vain as @entity84 ( @entity85 ) of @entity1 breaks through @entity86 missed with two long range kicks @entity1 @entity88 ( @entity85 ) gave an assured kicking display with three penalties and two conversions @entity27 ( r ) of @entity1 kicks to touch past @entity92 of @entity25 but while @entity54 ’ @entity62 future may be terminal , there remains plenty of life in @entity1			1
with the deepest pockets in the league and one of the biggest squads , the @entity97 have reason to be optimistic as they head towards @entity103 with centre @entity104 fit and firing again and @entity106 also set to return against @entity107 next saturday			0
the @entity108 got the better of his opposite number @entity110 — who started strongly before fading like the rest of his team — and @entity8 was full of praise			2
‘ @entity104 was a real pillar with the ball and was outstanding , ’ said @entity8			0
they think he ’s a one trick pony and just defends			0
but there ’s much more to his game			0
without question he ’s the most competitive person i have come across			0
i ’d have him in my international team every day of the week			0
’ captain @entity27 , one of three @entity1 ’ try scorers along with @entity22 and @entity124 , also impressed , while @entity88 kicked two conversions and two penalties as the home side overturned a 13 - 3 deficit to win at a canter			1
@entity129 kicked 11 points for @entity25 while @entity131 scored a try before @entity15 ’s late effort			1
but the visitors were off the pace in the second half and deservedly lost prop @entity137 to the sin bin after 57 minutes			0
‘ @entity1 showed why they ’re a champion team , ’ said @entity25 boss @entity139			1
@entity140 of @entity1 ( @entity85 ) is tackled by @entity25 captain @entity110 @entity1 players congratulate @entity15 after his late try secured a losing bonus point			1

@entity1 edged in - form @entity25 28 - 21 in their @entity52 clash
@entity124 , @entity27 and @entity22 scored for the @entity1
@entity110 missed with two long range kicks for the visitors
@entity25 left with a bonus losing point after a late @entity15 try
