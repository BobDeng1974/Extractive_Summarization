@entity1 's executive producer and @entity3 's right - hand man @entity2 has written an email to his colleagues titled ' au revoir ' - but today denied it was a resignation			1
mr @entity2 , a schoolfriend of @entity3 who helped revamp @entity1 in to the @entity8 's most successful show , congratulated staff on making ' one of the most iconic programmes in tv history '			1
the 52 - year - old , who has himself made millions from the show , said in his email that the @entity1 team ' made television that was beautiful to look at and beautiful to listen to '			1
and that alone , when you think about it , is quite an achievement for a show that started 13 years ago			0
' we had a lot of laughs , we had a lot of tiffs			0
we went to amazing places and we went to some s * * * holes			0
we nearly killed a presenter , we had to run for the border			2
' when you 're feeling low in your working day at any point , look around at some of the c * * * on tv , then have a think about @entity1 , 2002 - 2015 , and say to yourself : " i made that "			1
' reassuring them that they will keep their jobs even though @entity3 lost his he said : ' for those of you who still rely on it for work , do n't worry , because the @entity8 will make sure the show continues			1
' our stint as guardians of @entity1 was a good one , but we were only part of the show 's history , not the whole of it			1
those two words are bigger than us			0
the email was leaked by a @entity8 member of staff yesterday , which led to mr @entity2 denying he had quit the corporation			1
it appears he is a member of @entity8 staff whereas @entity3 , @entity25 and @entity75 are self - employed on freelance contracts			1
these were all due expire today			0
final time ? @entity25 , @entity75 and @entity3 on set in the final episode shown before the presenter lost his job new wheels : @entity3 was seen taking delivery of a black @entity85 car at his flat yesterday as he prepares for life after the @entity8 @entity1 presenter @entity25 has been spotted at the @entity8 where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director @entity88 - who may be in charge of trying to keep may and @entity75 as the corporation confirmed mr @entity2 is still a member of staff he said : ' the email i wrote yesterday was not a resignation statement , and nor was it meant for public consumption			1
' it was a private note of thanks to 113 people who have worked on the show over the years , but clearly one of those 113 is a bit of a tit , because they shared it with a website			2
' i do n't get this modern obsession with sharing , linking , forwarding , re-tweeting ; whatever happened to a private moment ? @entity2 , @entity1 ’s longstanding executive producer , has known mr @entity3 since they were children , when they both attended the £ 10,500 - a - term @entity109 in @entity110			1
the two men have been inseparable for years , and @entity8 executives put trust in mr @entity2 to keep mr @entity3 in check , following a string of scandals			1
the production company set up by @entity3 and @entity1 executive @entity2 , right , was formed for next to nothing in october 2006 and has now made them millions			1
the pair went to the same prestigious private school in @entity109 , @entity122 , where they were two years apart , before working together on various tv projects including @entity1			1
new boys at @entity109 were called ‘ stigs ’ and the pair had the appropriate idea of calling their sometimes put - upon test driver ‘ @entity128 ’			0
@entity131 6 was later bought into by @entity132 in 2007 , purchasing half the 10,000 shares and also handing over merchandising and some foreign sales rights to the company			0
its last publicly known financial results were released four years ago , where it made a £ 1.8million post-tax profit and paid out £ 700,000 to its shareholders			0
in 2012 @entity8 bought @entity3 out - making him £ 5million			2
there is speculation about where the name @entity131 6 comes from , and it is believed it is a pun on ' better sex ' - a reference to an in - joke about one of the dormitories at @entity2 and @entity3 's former school			1
' and if i were to resign , i would n't do it publicly , i 'd do it old school by handing in my , er , notice , to someone upstairs in @entity161 ' i work behind the camera and i would n't presume for one moment to think people are interested in what i do			0
now , everyone back to work			0
' mr @entity2 has been a regular visitor to his friend @entity3 since his sacking a week ago , and was last seen leaving his west @entity170 flat in his @entity85 sports car on friday			1
the previous day he had met with @entity3 and @entity1 co-star @entity25 for lunch , presumably to discuss the scandal and what the team would do next			1
last wednesday , on the day the presenter 's sacking was announced mr @entity2 was again at @entity3 's flat , this time with the star 's girlfriend @entity179 , @entity25 was yesterday spotted at the @entity8 where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director @entity88			1
the pair were seen laughing and chatting as they walked outside the @entity8 headquarters in @entity185 , @entity170 , where mr may was stopped by a passer - by for an autograph			2
the @entity8 declined to say what the meeting between the two was about , although it appears creative director @entity88 is in charge of trying to keep may and @entity75			0
last week he said he hoped @entity75 and may would stay at the corporation following the sacking of co-host @entity3			2
he also told the @entity193 that it was ' perfectly natural ' for the pair to have reservations about continuing @entity1 without @entity3			1
he said : ' it 's perfectly natural for them			2
they are a team they have worked together for a very long time , they are all very attached			0
' if @entity3 is not in it and @entity75 and @entity25 are , that needs to be a conversation with them as well			2
they need to be happy about what 's going on and where they think the programme needs to be			2
' he added : ' the question of what happens next for @entity1 is a conversation which must go on between the controller of @entity216 , between @entity2 ( @entity218 - producer of @entity1 ) and the team			1
' sources have told @entity221 that @entity222 are prepared to offer him £ 10million to sign for the trio , with @entity3 's executive producer and schoolfriend @entity2 having reportedly met with them			1
@entity226 are also said to be keen to sign them up for an exclusive online , worldwide series that could make them substantially more money			1
@entity8 director general @entity232 sacked @entity3 , 54 , after an internal inquiry found he had launched an ‘ unprovoked verbal and physical attack ’ on junior producer @entity237 , 36 because he could not have a steak			2
the row broke out after the star complained no hot food was available at the @entity242 hotel where the tv crew were staying after a day ’s filming			2
well , at least we left ' em wanting more			0
and that alone , when you think about it , is quite an achievement for a show that started 13 years ago			0
i know none of us wanted it to end this way , but for a moment i 'd like us to look back and think about just what an incredible thing you all had a hand in creating			0
when @entity261 gave us the green light in 2002 , the brief was to reinvigorate a car show and get an audience of three million			2
what you all ended up making was one of the most iconic programmes in tv history , a show about cars that went global , won countless awards , was devoured by non car fans and ended up in the @entity274			1
we had a lot of laughs , we had a lot of tiffs			0
we went to amazing places and we went to some s * * * holes			0
we nearly killed a presenter , we had to run for the border			0
we started off with whoever we could get in the @entity285 , and ended up with @entity286			0
throughout all this we made television that was beautiful to look at and beautiful to listen to			0
the work ethic never slipped , the desire for everyone in this dysfunctional family to do right by the show never faltered			0
@entity3 , @entity75 and @entity25 , as the visible tip of the iceberg , got most of the attention and praise , but you all in your own fields had such an immense hand in weaving this unforgettable tapestry			2
i would love to single out everybody by name to thank them for what they did , but it 's impossible and i 'd forget someone i should n't have and that would be crap , so i 'll just say @entity312 , i 'm sorry we never got a bear to drive an automatic			0
for those of you who still rely on it for work , do n't worry , because the @entity8 will make sure the show continues			0
our stint as guardians of @entity1 was a good one , but we were only part of the show 's history , not the whole of it			1
those two words are bigger than us			0
anyway , when you 're feeling low in your working day at any point , look around at some of the c * * * on tv , then have a think about @entity1 , 2002 - 2015 , and say to yourself : ' i made that			1
' a big , big , big thank you , which will never be enough			0

@entity2 forced to say he 's not quit after email to 113 @entity1 staff
@entity340 helped make ' one of the most iconic programmes in tv history '
mr @entity2 revamped @entity1 with old schoolfriend @entity3 in 2002
@entity222 and @entity226 said to be in pole position to sign presenter and @entity2
