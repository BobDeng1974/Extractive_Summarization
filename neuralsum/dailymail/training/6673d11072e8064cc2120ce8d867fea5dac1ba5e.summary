by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 05:42 est , 28 december 2012 appeal : @entity2 co-founded the @entity3 for body confidence magazines have been urged to ditch @entity7 ‘ miracle diets ’ that promise to help readers shed the pounds they have piled on over the festive season			1
@entity2 , the minister for women and equalities , claims such diets – which offer tips on how to lose up to a stone in a matter of days – encourage ‘ dangerous ’ behaviour and ‘ self - hate ’			1
in an open letter to women ’s , men ’s , health and celebrity magazines , she implored editors to stop focusing on short - term solutions and instead encourage sustainable healthy lifestyles			1
the @entity26 mp said : ‘ as editors you owe more to your readers than the reckless promotion of unhealthy solutions to losing weight			2
‘ if your aim is to give practical , sensible advice about losing weight – not how to drop a stone in five days – you should encourage reasonable expectations , instead of dangerous ones , along with exercise and healthy eating			1
’ speaking on @entity41 yesterday , @entity42 , who chairs the @entity44 on @entity45 , said : ‘ there ’s a real difference between having a crash diet and getting healthier			0
’ she added : ‘ it is irresponsible for magazines to offer “ tips , tricks and simple steps ” so that people can be thin			0
not healthy or vibrant , just thin			0
’ ' magazines should reflect ‘ real diversity ’ rather than showing only slim , young models			0
' editors , she added , ‘ need to be updating the type of january article that they ’re putting in their magazines to have a more positive body image rather than the sort of self - hate perpetuated by the fad diet articles ’			2
ms @entity2 co-founded the @entity68 in 2010 with fellow mp @entity69			2
it promotes diversity of women 's bodies in the media , as well as body confidence education in schools and honesty in advertising			0
the group 's founders believe the ' pressure to conform to impossible stereotypes ' is damaging to both men and women and increases low - self - esteem , depression and eating disorders			0
@entity88 , which was recently named the @entity90 ' most effective weight loss provider , welcomed the letter			1
a spokeswoman said : ' we ’re delighted that the government is taking measures to prevent the promotion of irresponsible and unhealthy fad diets			2
@entity88 is not a diet , it ’s a healthy lifestyle			0
' she said they encourage a ' healthy and sustainable weight loss ' of no more than 2lbs a week .			1

mp @entity2 urged magazines to ditch fad diets in new year editions
