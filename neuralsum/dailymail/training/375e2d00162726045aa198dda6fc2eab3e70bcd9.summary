' the chip is changing my life ' : @entity4 with the silver medal he won at the @entity6 and the obe he was awarded in 2009 he 's won more than 50 medals swimming for his country , but @entity4 only ever had the pleasure of seeing a handful of them			1
diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition at the age of 31 , the @entity13 went totally blind 17 years ago			1
but thanks to the fitting of a bionic eye , the 55 - year - old can now see his haul in all its glory			2
mr @entity4 – currently the chairman of the @entity22 – told yesterday how a revolutionary retinal chip is enabling him to make out shapes and read a clock face			1
the eight - hour procedure to implant an artificial retina brings hope to thousands who suffer with similar conditions			2
it costs up to £ 100,000 per patient and builds on previous attempts to produce a bionic eye using a camera and transmitter linked to a pair of glasses as a means of relaying images to the artificial retina			0
mr @entity4 is one of nine totally blind @entity42 patients who took part in a trial of the chip at the @entity46 and @entity47 , @entity48			1
he said of the moment medics switched on the chip : ‘ it was as if a match had been lit in a dark room – it was unbelievable			1
‘ in the lab tests , when there are objects on a table , and the lighting is bright , i can tell you how many objects there are , and most of the time i can read the clock			0
' to be able to see even the vaguest of blurry outlines of the medals i won is a terrific achievement and means a lot to me			0
’ mr @entity4 , from @entity71 , began losing his sight after developing retinitis pigmentosa , an inherited disease that destroys the retina and which affects an estimated 20,000 in the @entity42			1
he scooped silver and bronze in 1992 in @entity95 , silver and bronze in @entity98 in 1996 and a silver medal in @entity100 in 2000			0
he also won 11 gold world blind swimming championships medals during an illustrious career , before becoming performance director for the paralympic swimming team at the @entity106 and @entity107			0
he was honoured with an mbe in 2001 and an obe in 2009 , both for services to disabled sport			0
last october , medics inserted a 3mm square , light sensitive chip under the existing retina in his right eye			2
tiny : it is hoped that the 3mm chip could soon provide the 15million people left blinded by retinitis pigmentosa a means of partially restoring their vision this x-ray image shows the position of the chip and its power supply in a patient 's skull : when light enters the eye , the chip sends electrical signals to the optic nerve , which passes on the information to the brain the chip is packed with 1,500 light - sensitive panels , producing a pixelated image which is boosted by an ‘ amplifier ’ , buried inside the head behind the ear			1
each pixel mimics the function of the photoreceptor rod and cone cells in the eye which were destroyed as a result of mr @entity4 ’s condition			2
@entity150 , a consultant retinal surgeon involved in the trial , said : ‘ this technology has proven that it is possible to restore some sight to a person who before was completely blind			2
it is a huge step forward but there is still much more work to be done			0
’ professor @entity150 said because it is a trial , the chips were implanted in only one eye of each patient			0
the trial was funded by a grant from the @entity165 ’s @entity164 , while @entity167 chip manufacturer @entity166 also provided its devices for free			0
how it looks inside the eye : the tiny light - sensitive microchip sits in the macular region - the area of the eye where clear images are formed in normal - sighted individuals mr @entity4 in action in the pool : a sufferer of the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa , he has had his sight partially restored after taking part in the clinical trials of an implant placed at the back of his eye			1

swimmer @entity4 took part in clinical trials of the tiny 3mm implant
degenerative disease began to *rob* him of his sight at the age of 31
he *likens* moment implant was turned on to ' a match being lit in the dark '
it works by *detecting* light then electrically stimulating the optic nerve
trials judged a *success* in results *published* by *academics* today
