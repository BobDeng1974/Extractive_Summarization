royalty : princess @entity22 and her adventurer father @entity6 show off their flag on his return @entity6 and wife made a crown for their daughter and asked friends and family to refer to her as princess @entity22			1
her kingdom covers about 800 square miles of desert that has never been claimed by @entity11 or @entity10			1
@entity6 found @entity16 , one of the last unclaimed pieces of land on the planet , after searching for how he could fulfill his promise to @entity22			1
promise : @entity6 claimed a stretch of desert to @entity22 could be a real princess several attempts to claim ownership of the region have been made online , but @entity6 believes that by actually traveling to the site and planting the flag gave his claim an edge			1
' it ’s beautiful there , ' @entity6 said			2
' it ’s an arid desert in @entity54			0
bedouins roam the area ; the population is actually zero			0
' it took @entity6 14 hours to travel by caravan through the desert before he could plant the flag , which has a blue background and a seal and stars representing the family			1
he may have completed his journey in june , but it began at the start of the year when he was chatting to his young daughter			2
' over the winter , @entity22 and i were playing , and she has a fixation on princesses			2
she asked me , in all seriousness , if she ’d be a real princess someday , ' @entity6 said			2
' and i said she would			0
' as well as designing a flag for their country , @entity6 's children have also decided to name it the @entity79			1
princess @entity22 , who sleeps in a custom - made castle bed , is showing signs of being a generous ruler , and said that she wants to ensure children in the region have enough food			1
' that ’s definitely a concern in that part of the world			0
we discussed what we could do as a nation to help , ' @entity6 said			2
sovereign : @entity6 trekked across the desert for 14 days to stake a claim on @entity16 and plant his family flag @entity16 is one of the last unclaimed stretches of land on @entity100 , and is sandwiched between @entity10 and @entity11 he added that princess @entity22 , and her brothers @entity102 and @entity103 , could become a driving force in the region			1
' if we can turn @entity11 into an agricultural hub for the area ... a lot of technology has gone into agriculture and water , ' he said			2
' these are the things [ the kids ] are concerned with			0
' the next step for @entity6 is to get @entity11 and @entity10 to recognize his @entity79			1
' i feel confident in the claim we ’ve made , ' @entity6 said			0
' that ’s the exact same process that has been done for thousands of years			0
the exception is this nation was claimed for love			0
' @entity123 , professor of political science and international studies at the @entity126 , said the family 's claim will need to be recognized by the other @entity130 nations			0
she said it was not plausible for someone to plant a flag and say they have political control over the land without legal recognition from neighboring countries , the @entity140 or other groups			0
in addition , she said , it is not known whether people have ownership of the land , regardless of whether the property is part of a political nation			0
ready to rule : the @entity6 children want to use their kingdom to help children in the @entity130 region the @entity6 family remain undeterred however , and have ordered letterheads bearing the country 's seal			1
one of @entity6 's sons also made a serving tray featuring the flag while at camp			1
' they are really getting into the idea			0
i think the idea of a nation with a clear purpose of helping other people ... i think that ’ll be well - received and we ’ll get recognition from other nations to partner with , ' he said			0
but the main intent , @entity6 added , was to show his daughter he would follow through on the promise he made			2
' i think there ’s a lot of love in the world			0
