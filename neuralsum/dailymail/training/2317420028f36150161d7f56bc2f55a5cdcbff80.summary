a man has been refused an @entity2 operation to remove his excess skin after weight loss surgery - despite being so depressed he has tried to kill himself four times			1
@entity6 , who went from 30 to 11 stone following a gastric bypass operation , has been refused the operation			1
instead the 30 - year - old claims and has been told his issues with his appearance are ' all in his head '			0
mr @entity6 lost the weight following his operation on the @entity2 in 2007 and was initially happy with his appearance			1
he is upset he has been refused an operation to remove excess skin caused by the weight loss , which rubs , bleeds and leaves him unable to leave his house or have a relationship the excess skin is so bad he has to lift it to use the toilet and tuck it into his trousers when he gets dressed , and has led him to attempt suicide four times this year , mr @entity6 says here he is pictured before ( left ) and after ( right ) the @entity2 gastric bypass operation in 2007 after which he lost 19 stone			1
initially , he was happy with his appearance , but soon became so depressed by his excess skin but the dramatic weight loss left him with unsightly excess skin which caused his self - esteem to plummet to an all - time low , leaving him too embarrassed to leave the house , get a job , or have an intimate relationship			1
mr @entity6 paid for a tummy tuck operation at a private clinic in @entity43 and the @entity2 later funded further procedures to remove excess skin from his thighs and chest			1
mr @entity6 hoped the @entity2 would fund a final operation to remove excess skin from his arms , bottom and pubic area			1
but despite numerous applications the @entity2 @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity52 ) have supported decisions to refuse the surgery made by the @entity57 team , @entity56 and @entity58			2
they recently wrote to mr @entity6 to confirm their support of the decision not to fund an operation to remove his remaining excess skin citing a previous diagnosis of @entity65 - an imagined defect in appearance - as one of their reasons			1
but mr @entity6 said the issues with his appearance are far from imagined as his excess skin rubs , causing sores and bleeding			1
losing weight will be the answer to many people 's prayers			0
but they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side - effect : excess skin			2
this hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin , the dermis , which contains two proteins : elastin , which helps it retract , and collagen , for strength			0
when the skin is stretched too much through weight gain , these proteins tear and break , resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength			0
unfortunately , while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat , the skin can not retract			0
it is linked unpleasant health problems , from infections to back pain			0
doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body			2
factors that affect how much skin is left include age , how quickly the weight was lost ( gastric bands are slower than bypasses , for example ) , and , for women , the number of children she has had			2
many patients patients develop an “ apron ” of skin around the abdomen , and loose skin under the arms , chest and inner thighs			2
this excess skin can cause a range of medical problems			2
one of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial , fungal , or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry			2
patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise			0
excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo bariatric ( weight loss ) surgery			1
he said it is so bad he has to lift it to use the toilet and tuck it into his trousers when he gets dressed			0
he said he has become so depressed by his excess skin and his fight to have it removed he had tried to commit suicide on four occasions in the last year alone			2
mr @entity6 said : ' it 's not just the excess skin that 's made me depressed but the fight to have it removed			1
' i 'm obviously happy to have lost the weight but being left with all this excess skin makes me feel as though i 'm still fat			1
' i 'm still so self - conscious about my body i 'm too embarrassed to let people see it			0
' i 'm too embarrassed to go swimming and i feel too embarrassed to meet a woman as i 'm scared she 'll be repulsed by my body			0
' i 'm only 30 but i feel like i have the body of an elderly man			0
' the excess skin chafes , i get sores and have to use creams to soothe them			2
' it gets in the way when i want to go to the toilet , sometimes i lose my testicles within all the skin , it is that bad			0
' in a letter to mr @entity6 following his appeal against their decision , the @entity179 said mr @entity6 was physically healthy and they therefore did not see fit to alter the previous decision not to fund the operation to remove his excess skin			1
despite mr @entity6 's claims surgery to remove his excess skin would prevent him from wanting to take his own life they said an application for surgery based on preventing suicide was not one they could accept			1
they added they could not demonstrate further surgery would improve his mental health , wellbeing social integration or improved self - image			0
the letter went on to cite a previous diagnosis of @entity65 ( @entity65 ) and approved a referral for mr @entity6 to see a psychiatrist who specialises in @entity65			1
but mr @entity6 said he was unhappy with their decision as it did n't take new evidence into consideration including a recent examination from psychiatrist dr @entity208 from @entity209 , who said in her opinion he did not meet the criteria for @entity65			1
in a letter to mr @entity6 and his gp , dr @entity213 wrote : ' having examined @entity6 's excess skin today , it is my opinion that @entity6 does not have @entity65			1
' there is clear evidence of excessive skin on his arms , hip and buttock regions and pubic area			1
' these have a significant impact on his self - esteem , confidence and most importantly his function			0
' he needs to lift the excess skin in the pubic region in order to urinate			1
he believes it will prevent him from having an intimate relationship with a woman			0
' i therefore do not believe that there is an imagined defect in appearance			0
' mr @entity6 hoped the @entity2 would fund a final operation to remove excess skin from his arms , bottom and pubic area			1
but the local @entity52 have refused his application , citing a previous diagnosis of @entity65 ( @entity65 ) - where a person constantly imagines defects in their appearance mr @entity6 said , he wishes he could afford the procedure himself but his confidence is so low he 's unable to find work and no longer knows where to turn			1
he said : ' they have cited my mental health and suicide attempts as a reason not to fund the operation but it is the excess skin and the fight to have it removed which is causing the depression			2
' having this excess skin has left me with no confidence , i feel too embarrassed to go out or meet anyone			2
' if i had the skin removed i 'd have the confidence to go out to work and maybe meet a girlfriend			0
' without it i could live my life again			0
i do n't want to lose my thirties like i have my twenties - fighting for this skin to be removed			0
' if i was given funding for the operation i could go on to live a good life but until then i am suffering and will carry on suffering for the rest of my life			0
' a spokesperson for @entity52 said : ' the ccg is aware of this case , but we do not discuss individual details			0
' we can advise however , that aesthetic surgery for the removal of redundant skin after weight loss programmes or bariatric surgery will not normally be funded			0
' @entity288 added they could not comment on individual cases as it would breach patient confidentiality			0
