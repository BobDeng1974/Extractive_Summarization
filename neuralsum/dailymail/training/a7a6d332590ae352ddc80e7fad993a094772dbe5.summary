by @entity0 published : 21:24 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 21:25 est , 5 december 2013 millions of women and self - employed people will have a one - off chance to boost their state pensions by buying extra credits millions of women and self - employed people will have a one - off chance to boost their state pensions , the chancellor revealed yesterday			2
anyone who hits state pension age before 2016 , or who has already retired , will be able to buy extra credits to push their payout above the basic level of £ 110.15 a week			1
for a limited time they will have the chance to pay a new class of national insurance contribution			1
they will be able to boost their pension by £ 25 a week , increasing the maximum pension for someone on a basic payout to £ 135.15 a week			1
the cost of the top - up will be announced next week			2
the surprise move is to help the estimated 12 million pensioners who will not qualify for the new higher flat - rate state pension of around £ 155 a week which is being brought in on april 6 , 2016			1
the biggest winners will be women and the self - employed , who typically have poorer pensions			0
it is thought to be the first time people already claiming a pension have been able to add to it			2
@entity37 , head of pensions at @entity39 , said : ‘ a lot will depend on how much these top - ups cost – but you would think the government would want to make it seem a good deal			0
this will go a long way to solving the annoyance of people who will be retiring under the old state pension			2
’ there are two parts to the current state pension			2
a basic element – based on the number of years someone makes national insurance contributions – and a part that higher earners build up , known as a state second pension ( @entity59 ) , once called @entity60			0
this can top - up the pension to £ 270.15 a week			1
historically women have earned less than men and taken time off to have children			0
as a result , they have lower state pensions , while the self - employed do n’t qualify for the top - ups at all			0
currently , the average weekly state pension of a man is £ 148 ; and £ 131 for a woman			1
about 2.8 million women get less than £ 80 a week			1
about 4.2 million self - employed only qualify for £ 110.15 a week			1
from april 2016 , with the new flat - rate state pension , the state second pension will be abolished			0
everyone with 30 years of @entity78 pay - ins who retires from then on will get about £ 155 a week			1
those who have already earned higher top - ups will keep them			0
but those who will have retired before april 2016 wo n’t see any boost in their pensions			0
those affected say it is unfair that someone who retires the day before the new system starts could get a pension of £ 110.15 , while someone with an identical job history who hits pension age the following morning could get £ 155 a week			1
to level the playing field , the chancellor is offering these special top - ups from october 2015 , giving those with low pensions who retire before april 2016 the chance to increase their payouts by buying extra national insurance credits			0
dr @entity104 , a campaigner for savers , said : ‘ this is not a free lunch			0
but it is a real chance for people to build up a much better pension provided it does n’t cost too much			0

they will be able to pay a new class of @entity78
they can boost their pension by £ 25 a week
