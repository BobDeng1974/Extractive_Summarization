by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 23 january 2013 changes : a young boy enjoys a carton of @entity4 , which is one of several drinks to have sugar reduced to protect teeth and curb obesity soft drinks like @entity11 , @entity4 and @entity12 are to have their sugar content slashed by up ten per cent in an admission they should not have been so sweet in the first place			1
the reduction has been agreed by makers to protect the teeth of children and quell the ' rising tide of obesity ' in @entity24 , the government has said			1
at the moment a 500ml bottle of @entity4 contains as much as 13 teaspoons of sugar while a can of @entity12 has more than half a dozen			1
but @entity30 told @entity31 today they will not reduce the seven teaspoons in a 330ml can of their signature drink			1
they say they have lots of low calorie alternatives and have cut levels in its @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 brands			2
campaigners are still unimpressed , as despite sugar levels being reduced , most of these soft drinks drinks will still get a @entity46 red light , because they contain more than 6.3g of sugar per 100ml of liquid			1
@entity49 of the @entity51 pressure group said : ' so they are swapping one red light for another : not exactly impressive			1
' it came as the public health minister @entity55 said that you can spot poor @entity24 because they are usually overweight			0
a culture of unhealthy tv dinners and junk food has eroded family life and that many homes no longer even have a dining table , the @entity58 mp added			0
today @entity65 says the sugar in the @entity4 ready - to - drink line and @entity68 will be cut by ' up to 10 per cent ' , while @entity69 will reduce the calorie content across its drinks range , which includes @entity12 , by five per cent			1
the @entity73 brand has also announced it is to launch two flavours in a new slimline can which will represent a 10 per cent calorie reduction compared with its standard 275ml bottle , while @entity79 will look at controlling calories in popular product lines and @entity82 will offer more portion control packs and review its recipes			0
@entity55 welcomed the pledges as @entity86 has some of the highest obesity rates in the developed world , with 60 per cent of adults and one third of 10 and 11 - year - olds being overweight or obese			0
the government has launched its @entity94 calorie reduction pledge to encourage businesses and other organisations to help consumers consume less sugar			1
' being overweight and not eating well is bad for our health			0
to reverse the rising tide of obesity we have challenged the nation to reduce our calorie intake by five billion calories a day			0
on average that 's just 100 calories less a day per person , ' ms @entity55 said			2
reduction : lucozade energy will have sugar cut by 10 % and @entity12 by 5 % in changes that raise serious questions about why they were so sweet in the first place no change : but @entity30 's signature drink will not have its sugar levels reduced , as @entity120 says it has cut it in others and has many low - calorie alternatives ' today 's announcement will cut the calories and sugar by up to 10 % in leading brands like @entity11 and @entity4			1
through the @entity94 we are already achieving real progress in helping people reduce the calories and salt in their diet			0
overall , more than 480 companies including many leading high street brands have signed up to the @entity94			0
pleased : public health minister @entity55 says that the decision to slash sugar will benefit @entity24 ' all of the major supermarkets have now committed to removing artificial trans fats , and over 70 % of fast food and takeaway meals sold on the high street have calories clearly labelled , but more needs to be done			1
' we are encouraged by the extra businesses which have signed up today but i want to see even more progress			0
all in the food industry have a part to play and i now expect companies which are not yet taking action to come forward and make pledges			0
' last year @entity30 signed up to the government â€™s calorie reduction pledge to cut calories from sparkling soft drinks			1
' we recognise obesity is a serious public health issue , which is why we help people make informed choices about our products and encourage them to lead active lifestyles			0
we will continue to work in in partnership with others to help address the challenge of obesity , ' a @entity30 spokesman said			1
@entity169 chairwoman dr @entity168 said : " i 'm pleased to see the soft drinks manufacturers like @entity65 , @entity69 and @entity171 join @entity172 and @entity173 to make some very real commitments to help consumers cut down on their calories as they take control of their weight			2
' i hope we will now see others , including the out of home sector , taking a careful look at how they can build on this and come to the table with new commitments to encourage their customers choose smaller portions and swap to lower calorie options			0
' @entity193 director general @entity192 said : " we commend these businesses for joining existing pledge signatories in a shared commitment to support the calorie reduction challenge issued to the nation by ministers last year			0
of the 31 pledge signatories , 15 are manufacturers , demonstrating our sector 's willingness to engage and deliver improved public health outcomes under the deal			2
' on calorie reduction , and the other pledges already issued by the @entity169 , we urge the @entity208 to continue its efforts to broaden engagement and bring in new companies to work with those of our members , and others , who have already made substantial commitments through the @entity94			0
' @entity24 @entity217 director general @entity216 said : " we welcome the commitments made by leading soft drinks producers			2
our industry has been taking steps to reduce the calorie content of our drinks for many years now , and currently more than 60 % of all soft drinks contain no added sugar			1
' the eight new drink and food manufacturers , supermarket and catering companies to have signed up to the pledge join 23 others including @entity232 and @entity233 .			2

government welcomes the decision , which will also protect children 's teeth
