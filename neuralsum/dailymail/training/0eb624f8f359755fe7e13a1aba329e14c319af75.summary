@entity0 is back with a bang in her new 2015 calendar , in which she features alongside 24 ' no excuse ' mothers who proudly display the efforts of their intense fitness regimes			1
the 33 - year - old @entity8 rose to fame last year after she started a @entity11 campaign to try and convince mothers that they should n't be ' proud ' about flaunting their fuller figures but should instead be proactive about trimming them down			1
at the time the mother - of - three said : ' we need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the @entity17 and start celebrating people who are a result of hard work , dedication and discipline			1
' @entity32 - who was accused of ‘ fat shaming ’ when she posted an image of herself looking trim and toned in her workout gear , along with the caption ‘ what ’s your excuse ? ’ - has since said that it was not her intention to hurt people , but rather just to tell the truth			1
as a result of the incredible reaction to her campaign , the fitness - focused entrepreneur founded a non-profit organisation aimed at encouraging mothers to take a more active interest in their personal health and exercise routines			1
' the @entity71 is a group of moms focused on growing healthily , connecting our community , leading our youth and supporting each other , ' @entity32 writes on her website			2
' we have free workout locations throughout the world			0
we have life , stress , work , kids , responsibilities and obligations			0
' we struggle making time for workouts , we splurge on cookie dough and enjoy ( and often need ) a glass of wine			0
and that ’s completely okay			0
balance is one of the keys to success			0
' fitness is fun : no excuse mom @entity100 prefers planks as her toning activity of choice happy families : stay - at - home mom @entity105 believes that ' sweat is magic ' the calendar , which is on sale on the group 's website for $ 14.99 , includes a whole host of nutrition tips , exercise ideas and time management suggestions , as well as four home workouts created specifically for hard - working mothers to fit into their day - to - day schedules			1
each of the women featured are , according to @entity32 ' real , every day moms who transformed themselves through fitness '			1
' we asked our mothers to show the world what an every day mother looks like , without covering scars , stretch marks , or cellulite , ' she told @entity131			2
' health does not look the same on everyone , and it was important for our daughters and sons to see that beauty and fitness comes in all shapes and sizes			2
' family fitness : @entity142 ensures that her children all lead active , healthy lifetysles ' i am their role model ' : mother - of - three @entity147 gained almost 70 pounds during her pregnancies ' never miss a monday ! ' @entity149 claims that her fitness routine is a sign that she loves her body the health - obsessive claims that she has had to work hard to achieve her fit figure - and is quick to dispel the myth that it has been in any way easy for her			1
' my mother has struggled with weight her entire life and when i was little ( growing up and comparing my body to my 2 younger sisters ) it seemed my bone and body structure was more favorable to my mom ’s genetics , ' she admits on her website			2
' this realization made me aware of my food intake and activity output at a young age			0
i saw first - hand how difficult it was to deal with diabetes , heart disease , high blood pressure and kidney failure			0
where it all began : @entity32 first rose to prominence after posting this photo of herself on @entity11 ' however , let ’s say i did have great genetics , i ’ve always believed 30 % of your body is genetic and the rest is environment			1
the majority of my success is based on my lifestyle			0
' in addition to her roles as a mother , wife and fitness guru , @entity32 also owns two residential care homes for the elderly , a position which she describes as her ' passion '			2
' residents are much like family , for they have witnessed every pregnancy and every new arrival , ' she says of the job			0
' i have witnessed them laugh , eventually decline and am sometimes present at their death bed			0
