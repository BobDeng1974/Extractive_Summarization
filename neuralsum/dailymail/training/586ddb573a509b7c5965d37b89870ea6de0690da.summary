the @entity10 in @entity11 posted the appeal first thing monday after its lead pastor reverend @entity14 begged the young mother - who is just shy of six months pregnant - and her partner to let him find an appropriate adoptive family			1
when they agreed , he took to social media and was shocked when he received more than 900 responses in a day from families willing to adopt the child and raise it as their own			2
the parents are now interviewing three of those families with an adoption agency			1
strange appeal : the @entity10 in @entity11 posted a message , pictured , on its @entity6 page asking for a family to adopt an unborn baby with @entity9 syndrome ' when we got in and opened up around 9:30 , it was nearly nonstop			1
all day long , we were receiving phone calls from people who wanted to adopt the baby , ' church staff member @entity35 told the @entity39			0
' father @entity14 has gotten over 900 emails in regard to the baby			0

if a couple has not been found by today they plan to abort the baby			2
' if you are interested in adopting this baby please contact @entity60			0
we are asking all to pray for this baby and the wisdom that this couple realize the importance of human life and do not abort this beautiful gift from @entity68			0
' the couple , who have not been identified , live in a state where abortion is prohibited after 24 weeks			0
inundated : the @entity72 , pictured , in @entity11 was inundated with calls and emails after it posted the appeal first thing monday deal : reverend @entity78 , left , took to @entity6 after he made a deal with the couple to find adoptive parents after the unborn baby was diagnosed with @entity9 thanks : the church was overwhelmed by the responses from willing families and posted its thanks on @entity6 , pictured given the mother was already almost six months pregnant , @entity14 had only a short time to find appropriate adoptive parents			1
but even the church was gob - smacked by the flood of offers , which came from all over the @entity93 and across the globe including from @entity95 , @entity96 and the @entity97			2
' i think it is a wonderful use of social media , that word can so quickly get all over the country and even to foreign countries and that the people who see the value of life are stepping up and saying , " i will take that baby and raise that baby as mine , " ' @entity35 told @entity108			0
' it was a beautiful witness all day long that so many people wanted this child and believed in the dignity of that child - downs syndrome or not			0
