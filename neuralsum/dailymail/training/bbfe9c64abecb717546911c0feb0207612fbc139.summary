by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 2 august 2013 workers have just put the final beam on top of @entity5 's newest tallest building			1
the staggering 2,073ft tall @entity6 looms high above the forest of skyscrapers which makes up @entity5 's financial capital			1
but the astonishing rate of growth means @entity6 might only hold onto its crown for a short time as plans for a mega skyscraper are already advanced			2
@entity15 for heights : a journalist looks at the cityscape of downtown @entity6 from the top @entity6 , which is undergoing construction , during the topping out ceremony journalists and photographers were invited to take in the stunning views from the top of the 125 - storey building during a topping out ceremony today			1
the event was held to make the completion of the core structure when the last beam was installed			0
@entity6 is located in the @entity31 , an area of @entity6 that was farmland a little over 20 years ago and has seen an explosion of construction of skyscrapers over the last decade			0
the area is @entity5 's first super-tall district , as @entity6 rises to complete a trio of towers including the adjacent @entity39 and @entity40			1
view from the top : the @entity6 reaches way above the 1,614ft @entity40 , centre , and the 1,381ft @entity39 , left , in @entity6 breathtaking : @entity6 's financial district of @entity45 seems rather small when seen from the top of the 2,073ft @entity6 , which is nearing completion designer @entity48 said : ' @entity6 represents a new way of defining and creating cities			1
' by incorporating best practices in sustainability and high - performance design , by weaving the building into the urban fabric of @entity6 and drawing community life into the building , @entity6 redefines the role of tall buildings in contemporary cities and raises the bar for the next generation of super-highrises			1
' but a @entity5 consortium has already expressed a desire to build the world 's tallest tower - all 2,749ft of it			1
if construction of the planned 220 - storey ' @entity72 ' , in @entity73 , the provicincial capital of @entity74 , takes place , it would dwaft the current world 's tallest building , the 2,716ft tall @entity78 in @entity79			1
the world 's tallest building , the @entity78 , in @entity79 , juts above the fog in what looks like a science fiction scene @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , a construction company based in @entity74 , believers they can do the whole $ 628million construction in 90 days			2
the project has been given the go - ahead in @entity73 , but work has not yet begun			1
@entity6 will house @entity92 office space , retail , a luxury hotel and cultural venues			0
the uppermost floors will feature the world 's highest observation deck , while the tower 's podium will offer a high - end retail environment with a major event space			1
below - grade facilities include retail , connections to the @entity106 and three floors of parking			0
' with the topping out of @entity6 , the @entity31 trio will serve as a stunning representation of our past , our present and @entity5 's boundless future , ' said @entity115 , @entity6 design leader and @entity48 principal			1
@entity117 : a few journalists take in the view from the top of @entity6 which is @entity5 's tallest building ... for now rise of the skyscrapers : the 125 - storey @entity6 , centre , which broke ground in november 2008 , looms over other skyscrapers , @entity39 , right , and @entity40 , left , ' this tower takes inspiration from @entity6 's tradition of parks and neighborhoods , recasting that history in a high - density , urban form symbolizing the emergence of modern @entity6 and @entity5			1
' topping out : the @entity6 , right , is under construction next to the @entity40 , center , and @entity39 , left the project 's developer is the @entity6 ; @entity135 is the structural engineer ; @entity137 are the mechanical , electrical and plumbing engineers ; and the @entity139 and @entity140 of @entity141 is the @entity142			2
the development is slated for completion in 2014			0
@entity6 is organized as nine cylindrical buildings stacked one atop the other			0
the inner layer of the double - skin fagade encloses the stacked buildings , while the exterior facade creates the building envelope , which rotates 120 degrees as it rises and gives @entity6 its distinctive , curving appearance			2
the spaces between the two fagade layers create nine atrium sky gardens			0
much like plazas and civic squares in traditional cities , the public sky atria offer spaces within @entity6 for interaction and community gathering space with restaurants , cafis , coffee shops and convenience stores , as well as lush landscaping throughout			0
with sky gardens lining its perimeter , @entity6 is literally enveloped in public spaces			0
@entity6 's interior and exterior skins are transparent , establishing a visual connection between the tower 's interiors and the urban fabric of @entity6			2
on the ground level , retail and event spaces , in tandem with abundant entrances on the site and a subway station under the building , continue the physical and visual connections between the tower and the city			0
@entity6 will have the world 's fastest lifts , with the @entity190 - designed , double - height cabs whisking building occupants and visitors skyward at 40 mph using innovative technologies designed specifically for the tower			1
sustainability is at the core of @entity6 's design			2
the facade 's taper , texture and asymmetry work in partnership to reduce wind loads on the building by 24 percent , offering a $ 58million savings in overall building materials			0
the building 's transparent inner and outer skins admit maximum natural daylight , thereby reducing the need for electric light			0
the tower 's outer skin also insulates the building , reducing energy use for heating and cooling			0
the tower 's spiraling parapet collects rainwater , which is used for the tower 's heating and air conditioning systems			0
wind turbines located directly beneath the parapet generate on - site power for the upper floors of the building , with a 2,130kw natural gas - fired cogeneration system on site providing electricity and heat energy to the lower floors			2
fully one third of the site will be green space with landscaping that cools the site			0
overall , @entity6 's sustainable strategies will reduce the building 's carbon footprint by 34,000 metric tons per year ; and the tower is targeting @entity245 certification from the @entity247 @entity246 and the @entity5 @entity249 rating .			1
