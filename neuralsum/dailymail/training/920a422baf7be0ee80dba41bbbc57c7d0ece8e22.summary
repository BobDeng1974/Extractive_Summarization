@entity1 smashed into @entity2 , 26 , her younger sister @entity3 , 25 , and their friend @entity3 , 25			1
the three young women were mown down just yards from the entrance of @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , in the early hours of february 21 , 2009			1

as well as having to cope with the fourth anniversary of losing miss @entity2 and miss @entity24 today , their devastated families have been told @entity1 will be released by the end of this month			1
they are now waiting for the call from the probation service to confirm when he will walk out of the prison gates into a new life of freedom			2
today , furious @entity49 , 31 , the brother of @entity24 , has called for a change in the law			2
he is demanding that criminals deemed unfit to serve in prison should be treated in hospital and then sent to jail to start their sentence			2
echoing mr @entity49 's anger , survivor of the horrific crash @entity26 , of @entity22 , said she was very ' cross ' that @entity1 has ' got off lightly with a lesser sentence '			1
mr @entity49 , of central @entity62 , said : ' we have been told he ( @entity1 ) will be released at the end of february , we do n't know the exact date			1

what makes it worse is he has only served just over one month in prison			0
' miss @entity3 , now 29 , said : ' as a family we do try not to think too much about him ( @entity1 ) , but knowing he has only served one month in prison , for taking two lives , makes me so cross			1
' it feels like he has got off with a lesser sentence			0
' whether he was sentenced to eight or 20 years , he would be out one day with the opportunity of a second chance ' a second chance @entity2 and @entity3 will never have			1
' mr @entity49 added : ' the law needs to be changed			0
if someone is detained in hospital , deemed too ill to go to prison , they should be treated and brought to a position where they are aware of what has happened , and what they have done			2
' then and only then should they be sent to prison to serve their sentence			0
in this case , he would have served a total of eight years , which is what he was ultimately sentenced to			0

mrs @entity69 , of @entity22 , said : ' this year has been the worst			1
i tend to bury my head in the sand and do n't really think about him ( @entity1 ) , i 'm not really interested in what happens to him whatsoever			1
' but she stressed : ' having said that , it is a small town and you do hear things			0
it is extremely hard , it should n't be any different to any other year , but it is			0
the biggest insult for me would be if he came out and reoffended			0
' this is his second chance ' i want him to take it			0
he is lucky to have it and must make the most of it			0
my friends tell me i have forgiven him and , although i ca n't say the words out loud , i think in my heart i have			0
