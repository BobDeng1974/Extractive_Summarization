by @entity1 reporter as authorities continue to search for the vanished @entity3 777 , a cyclone in the @entity5 is nearing the designated search area off the coast of @entity8 , @entity9			1
although @entity12 is currently well north of the search area - about 2,500 kilometers from mainland @entity9 - experts continue to monitor its movement in case it bears south			1
crews searching for the missing plane have already had to contend with fog and other weather conditions as they search an area known as the ' @entity22 ' because of its rough waters			1
with 10 aircraft now in the air searching , the crews are working off images found by both @entity29 and @entity9 satellites , according to @entity30			1
bad weather has hindered the search for the missing @entity3 plane			0
while @entity12 in the northern @entity5 could bear down on the search area , another tropical storm has come in from the west @entity37 was causing strong winds and rough seas in the southern @entity5 where ships and vessels are searching for objects spotted by an @entity9 satellite and possibly related to @entity44 new data : this satellite image , captured by the @entity29 on march 18 , is of a floating object measuring about 73 feet long by 43 feet wide			1
it is the second debris to be found in the area after similar data was first found by @entity9 the most recent - the @entity29 footage , which released on tuesday - is of an object that is floating in the ocean measuring 73 feet by 43 feet			1
it is approximately 75 miles away from the object detected by the @entity9 satellite			1
searchers in the air have yet to find these objects or confirm they are connected to missing @entity60			0
ships have also been tasked with searching the area			2
what was believed to be a wooden pallet that could have come from the jet was seen by one plane sunday , but another search plane sent to photograph it could not locate the pallet			0
@entity30 aviation expert and former @entity72 pilot @entity70 said even if the storm does n't hit the search area head on , it can still affect the search effort since crew members may have difficulty identifying debris in whitecap waves churned up by a faraway storm			0
additionally , if there is debris from the plane in the ocean , a large storm could displace it , making it almost impossible for investigators to trace the debris to a crash site as they have done in earlier investigations			0

' if you 've got floating debris and the sea scape goes from eight to 10 feet to 40 to 45 feet your chances of sinking that [ debris ] becomes great , ' @entity117 said			2
' the large structures that we have been seeing , if they are indeed from the airplane , are probably very vulnerable to be sunk from the cyclone			0
' @entity128 , a search and recovery expert and founder of @entity132 , said if the plane did crash into the water , weather events such as cyclones would likely not affect the crash site			0
if the plane crashed where search crews are looking , @entity128 said investigators would expect to find wreckage on the ocean floor that likely would be undisturbed by weather patterns thousands of feet above on the ocean surface			2

' a classic pattern , it 's probably no more than 1,500 to 2,000 meters in the longest dimension and about half as wide			0
' search crews will start the search for the vanished plane on monday			0
flight 370 vanished march 8 with 239 people aboard while en route from @entity171 , @entity172 , to @entity173 , setting off a multinational search that has turned up no confirmed pieces and nothing conclusive on what happened to the jet .			0

@entity37 is causing rough seas and strong winds in the southern @entity5
some 10 aircraft and a fleet of ships are searching the area following near data about a significant floating object
@entity190 picked up by an @entity9 satellite , @entity29 and @entity192 have also had more recent readings on what is believed to be the same object
according to the @entity29 data , the object is 73 feet wide and 43 feet long
it 's location is about 2,500 kilometers off the coast of @entity9
officials worry the weather conditions may sink the object before they find it
@entity44 has been missing for over two weeks
