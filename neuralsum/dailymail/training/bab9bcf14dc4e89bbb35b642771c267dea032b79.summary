by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 12:20 est , 21 june 2013 rebels fighting to hold @entity3 's economic hub from government forces are facing an enemy their @entity6 's can not target			2
a virulent flesh - eating disease known as ' @entity9 boil ' is sweeping the city as the destruction of its infrastructure has led to a breakdown in sanitation systems			1
also known as the ' @entity9 evil ' or , to give it its proper name , cutaneous leishmaniasis , it causes painful lesions which can become secondarily infected , often leading to permanent disfigurement			0
smashed city : damaged buildings in the @entity24 neighbourhood of @entity9 , an area controlled by @entity3 rebel fighters , where a flesh eating disease known as ' @entity9 boil ' is on the rise due to breakdown in sanitation scenes of destruction : smoke rises from @entity34 neighbourhood in @entity9 's frontline the sandflies which spread it flourish in waste and sewage which can now be found almost everywhere in the heavily bombarded city , where sewer systems have been blasted open by artillery shells			1
the @entity44 is monitoring the spread of the disease which , despite its gruesome symptoms , is generally not fatal , and reported 1,047 cases across @entity3 in may			2
that may well be a massive underestimate , since the frequent movement of @entity3 displaced by the conflict to other regions inside and outside the country make figures hard to pin down			0
and as @entity57 promises to supply heavy weapons to rebels currently on the back foot against the better armed government forces , the problem is only likely to get worse			1
@entity63 's foreign minister said today that @entity64 is sending contradictory signals on @entity3 that could derail an international conference intended to end that country 's civil war			1
virulent : the parasite which causes the disease is spread by sandflies which flourish in waste and sewage			2
right , a stock image shows the kind of boil those affected with the ' @entity9 evil ' suffer from @entity83 , speaking in an interview with the @entity80 and the @entity82 news agencies , warned that @entity57 talk about a possible no - fly zone would only encourage the rebels to keep fighting			1
he also criticised demands that @entity3 president @entity88 step down			0
' not because we like the regime , not because we want the regime to stay , but because it 's for the @entity3 to decide , ' said mr @entity83			1
' and to say you must capitulate and deliver the power to us is just not realistic			0
' and he dismissed allegations by the @entity57 , @entity96 and @entity97 that @entity88 's regime has used chemical weapons			1
@entity63 has been the key ally of @entity88 's regime throughout the @entity3 conflict , which has killed more than 93,000 people , shielding it from @entity104 sanctions and continuing to provide it with weapons			1
still opposed to @entity88 : a photo distributed by a rebel media source shows anti-regime protesters holding banners and chanting slogans during a demonstration in the neighborhood of @entity114 in @entity9 the harder edge of opposition : @entity117 , the leader of the artillery and mortar battalion in the @entity120 , uses a knife to prepare a handmade mortar shell in the @entity124 hospital frontline in @entity9 a photo distributed by the rebels shows members of the free @entity128 preparing their weapons , in the neighborhood of @entity131 in @entity9 , amid rumours they have received a shipment of arms from @entity136 allies @entity63 president @entity137 has confirmed that his country signed a contract for the delivery of state - of - the - art @entity142 air defence missile systems to @entity3 , but said it has n't been fulfilled yet			1
mr @entity83 defended the @entity142 deal , pointing to the deployment of @entity57 @entity147 air defense missiles and fighter jets to neighbouring @entity149			1
' the contract on s - 300s is absolutely legal , it 's transparent and it 's fully in line with the international norms and with the @entity63 export control legislation , ' he said			1
' second , the contract has n't been yet finalised			0
third , the @entity57 are leaving @entity157 after this exercise in @entity149 , together with f - 16 planes , and no one is asking them not to do this			0
' the region is really full of weapons , including offensive weapons which have been supplied in the past to the countries of the region , and some of these weapons are infiltrating into @entity3			2
' he said supplies of weapons to the @entity3 opposition , which have been promised by @entity64 and are being considered by the @entity173 , would be a ' very big mistake			2
' hearts and minds : a @entity3 colonel speaks to children on a street in @entity181 neighbourhood uncertainty : government soldiers are on the verge of retaking the city , but promised shipments of weapons from the @entity57 could prolong the fighting modern warfare : forces loyal to @entity3 's president @entity88 aim their weapons towards @entity192 neighbourhood , an area controlled by rebel fighters mr @entity83 was asked if @entity63 is warning the @entity195 in particular against providing the rebels with shoulder - fired air defense missiles that could challenge @entity88 's air dominance			1
he replied : ' we believe this is absolutely illegitimate , and we are n't going to legitimise it by starting discussing some conditions on which these supplies could be justified			0
' mr @entity137 , speaking to reporters after meeting with @entity207 chancellor @entity206 at a business forum in @entity209 , argued that @entity212 weapons , if they are supplied to the opposition , could fall into the hands of the @entity215 - linked militants who form part of the rebel force and eventually be used against the @entity195			1
he also warned that if president @entity88 steps down , that could lead to the vacuum of power that would be quickly filled by @entity215 - connected rebels			2
' how can we avoid it ? there are well - armed , and very aggressive , ' he said			0
mr @entity83 said during today 's interview that while the @entity57 says it favours sponsoring a @entity3 peace conference in @entity229 , it has made statements that have sent a conflicting signal to the rebels			1
he said that the @entity57 talk about a possible no - fly zone in particular has encouraged the opposition to step up fighting instead of sitting down for talks			0
' the message the opposition is getting : guys , do n't go to @entity229 , do n't say you are going to negotiate with the regime , soon things will change in your favour , ' mr @entity83 said			2
' it 's either the conference or the instigation of the opposition not to be flexible			0
i do n't think it 's possible to do both at the same time			0
' brandishing his weapon : a @entity250 fighter from the @entity251 shows his weapon decorated with his party 's flag , as a fellow fighter looks on in @entity9 's @entity256 neighbourhood the @entity257 are n't going to like this ... female fighters from the @entity251 patrol the blasted streets of their city @entity250 fighters from @entity9 have joined the @entity263 to fight against forces loyal to @entity88 the date and location of the international conference on @entity3 have n't been announced yet , but it 's already being dubbed ' @entity229 ' because a similar event was held there a year ago			0
' if our goal is the conference , then we must avoid any discussions and , of course , any action designed to establish a no - fly zone			0
we must avoid confrontational debates and one - sided resolutions in the ( @entity278 ) @entity277 and in the @entity279 because all this is n't helping to create the atmosphere necessary to convene a conference , ' mr @entity83 said			2
he shrugged off the @entity57 , @entity96 and @entity97 statements about the use of chemical weapons by the @entity3 regime as ungrounded , saying they ' smack of politics and speculation			1
' ' we have been told by the @entity57 , by the @entity97 , by the @entity96 that they have proofs , ' he said			0
' what they showed to us is absolutely unconvincing			0
it 's not based on facts , and it ca n't be taken as a proof			0
' he said that a new international probe must determine the truth and added that after the conflict is over , @entity3 could be encouraged to destroy its chemical weapons stockpiles .			1

breakdown of sanitation in smashed city is *exacerbating* the problem
disease is *non-lethal* , but can leave sufferers permanently disfigured
@entity63 warns supplying weapons to rebels could *backfire* on the @entity195
