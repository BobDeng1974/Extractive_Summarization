by @entity0 @entity2 all - star @entity1 has undergone successful surgery on his broken right leg and is expected to remain in the hospital for about three days			1
the six - foot 10 - inch @entity1 had an operation at @entity8 in @entity9 to repair the open tibia - fibula fracture , @entity6 said in a statement early saturday morning			1
dr. @entity13 , dr. @entity14 and @entity6 team physician @entity15 , were present for the surgery , the release said			2
@entity1 suffered the gruesome right leg injury late in the @entity19 national team 's intrasquad scrimmage friday night			1
he leaped to contest a fast - break layup by @entity21 with 9:33 left in the fourth quarter and his leg smashed against the bottom of the backboard stanchion and crumpled			1
with players looking visibly upset , coach @entity36 then announced to the crowd that the scrimmage would not be finished out of respect to @entity1 and his @entity41 saturday morning , @entity42 , the @entity2 president of basketball operations , issued an updated statement saying it 's too early to start talking about @entity1 's expected return			1
' we are hopeful at some point next week @entity1 will return to @entity49 to continue his recovery , ' @entity42 said			1
' there is no question about the impact on our team but our goal is to be as strong - willed and determined as @entity1 will be in coming back			1
our franchise has had setbacks in its history but has demonstrated the abilities to recover			0
@entity1 will provide the example of that off the court and it is up to the rest of us to provide that example on the court			1
any discussion regarding the future of our team would be inappropriate at this time			0
our focus is solely on @entity1 and doing whatever we can to help			1
' @entity42 also said the @entity2 are committed to helping the national team give basketball a global reach			1
' this is a first for us in @entity6 , to have something like this take place , ' @entity6 chairman @entity74 said			0
' it 's a tough situation for our entire organization , the coaches , the players			0
there 's no way the game could have gone on under the circumstances			2
' flat out : the @entity2 lays on the floor after a devastating injury that ruled him out of the @entity90 moment : @entity1 ( left ) lands awkwardly after contesting a lay - up from @entity21 ( second left ) doctors estimate a full recovery could take as much as 18 @entity95			1
@entity96 , who treated @entity98 guard @entity97 when he sustained a similar injury during the @entity101 regional finals in 2013 , said @entity1 will likely need 6 to 12 weeks to recover from surgery and another 6 to 10 weeks to get back to a normal walking gait			1
@entity96 is not treating @entity105 complete recovery , @entity96 said , normally takes 12 to 18 months , though the fact he is an elite athlete in top shape could speed up that timeframe.the hardest part for the @entity2 might be keeping @entity1 off the court once he thinks he 's ready			1
' it 's a challenge because ( athletes ) want to push the envelope always , ' @entity96 said			0
' the question that is already being asked this morning is how quickly can he get back			0
first , he has to get back to a normal life , then his body needs to work in an efficient way and once those pieces are in place , he can start training			0
' @entity1 was considered a lock to make the final 12 - man roster for the @entity122 that starts later this month in @entity123			1
' thanks everybody for the love and support , " he wrote on @entity124			0
" i 'll be ok and be back better than ever ! ! ! love y'all ! ! ' the @entity19 planned to reduce the 20 - player pool to 14 or 15 players saturday , but put off those plans after @entity1 's injury			1
' everything 's on hold right and it should be , ' @entity36 said			0
' it would be so inappropriate for us to talk about anything else when there 's a serious injury like this			2
' the defending champion @entity19 team had already been weakened by player losses			0
forwards @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity151 @entity150 had all pulled out in recent weeks			2
@entity36 and @entity74 refused to discuss the roster after the game , saying they did n't even know when they would make roster reductions			2
' as an organization , we 're just going to let a little bit of time go by here before we address anything like rosters , all that stuff , ' @entity74 said			0
' it seems so unimportant in the big scheme of things when you have something like this take place			0
it puts things in perspective			0
' @entity1 would have been a candidate to start for the @entity19 alongside @entity173			2
the two , along with @entity21 , spent the week playing in 1 - on - 1 competitions after practice , pushing one another while building chemistry leading up to friday night 's game			1
