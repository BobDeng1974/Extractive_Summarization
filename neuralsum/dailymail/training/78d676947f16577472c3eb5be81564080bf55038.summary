by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 12 september 2012 updated : 06:19 est , 13 september 2012 it looks like an alien mothership - but it could be @entity4 's new airport			1
that 's according to a major global architecture firm who have unveiled their vision for a ' @entity10 ' airport in the @entity11			0
the @entity10 , designed by architects @entity12 , includes four floating runways tethered to the sea bed			1
@entity12 says new runways could be floated in as required - allowing for future expansion to accommodate six landing strips			1
the mothership : an artist 's impression of how the airport could look passengers would check in and arrive at terminals on the land			0
two would be located to the north and south of the estuary and a third central @entity4 terminal is proposed between @entity30 and the @entity31			1
the @entity32 reported today that @entity4 mayor @entity33 , who in the past backed proposals for a @entity11 island airport , dubbed ' @entity10 ' , has seen the @entity12 proposal			1
a spokesman for the mayor said : ' this will form , along with other significant submissions , an important part of discussions going forward			2
' where the proposed floating airport island would be placed , in the @entity11 off the coast of @entity45 @entity46 would close under the scheme and become a new eco-city and ' the largest urban expansion project in @entity50 ' , with housing for around 300,000 people expansion : debate has raged for years over a third runway at @entity46 the airport would be connected to @entity4 by high - speed rail			1
@entity12 has built airports all over the world and unveiled the plans in a bid to be considered as the designers for any future airport project			1
@entity64 , project director , said : ' because this airport is floating it could be positioned in an optimal location after you evaluate flight paths , bird migrations and all the rest of the issues in the estuary			0
there 's a lot of flexibility			0
' @entity33 was pictured doing his best to keep the @entity78 spirit alive by going for an early morning run the @entity4 mayor was then snapped getting on his bike to go to work after performing a few stretches mr @entity64 added : ' it absolutely could be done			1
it 's all fairly standard technology and marine engineering is what we 're good at in @entity89			0
' the idea of floating runways is fairly basic stuff - we 're just proposing it on a scale , perhaps , that has never been done before			1
' we 're locked in a political debate about whether to build a little runway extension [ at @entity46 ] or whether we build a proper airport			0
' this could be an airport for the next 100 years			0
' the @entity12 scheme would see @entity46 close and become a new eco-city and ' the largest urban expansion project in @entity50 ' , with housing for around 300,000 people			1
however , the government has said there will be no firm decisions on @entity89 airport expansion before the next general election			2
ministers have come under intense pressure from business to approve a third runway at @entity46 , @entity89 's only international hub airport , but the issue has led to bitter in - fighting within the @entity115 party			2
some @entity116 are calling for a u-turn , with former minister @entity118 saying the issue was a test of whether the prime minister is a ' man or a mouse '			0
the chancellor @entity123 , who is in charge of election policy for the @entity116 , has also opened the door for the @entity115 to complete a u-turn on the third runway issue			0
but mr @entity33 said it would be a ' disaster ' while the mp for @entity131 and @entity133 @entity132 warned he would stand down at the next election if his party does not block expanding @entity89 's biggest airport			2
a decision on whether to support any of the recommendations in an independent commission ’s final report will be taken after 2015 , new transport secretary @entity137 said last week			0
mr @entity137 said : ' this is a very difficult debate , but the reality is that since the 1960s @entity89 has failed to keep pace with our international competitors in addressing long - term aviation capacity and connectivity needs			2
' he went on : ' the government believes that maintaining the @entity89 ’s status as a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long - term international competitiveness			2
' but the government is also mindful of the need to take full account of the social , environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport capacity			0

plan by architects @entity12 , includes four runways tethered to the sea bed
@entity12 says new runways could be floated in - allowing for expansion
it is claimed @entity4 mayor @entity33 has seen the proposal
