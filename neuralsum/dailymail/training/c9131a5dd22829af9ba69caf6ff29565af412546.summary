by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has taken a swipe at @entity6 's @entity5 squad by claiming his 2006 team were better prepared to win the @entity8 than the 2014 edition are now			1
@entity5 open their campaign against @entity11 tonight hoping for a strong start in a difficult @entity13 , which also contains @entity14			0
but @entity2 believes @entity6 's men will have had a successful tournament in @entity17 if they reach the last - eight			2
winners ? @entity2 ( right ) believes his 2006 @entity5 squad was better than @entity6 's challenge : @entity2 says that @entity6 's ( centre ) men will do well to get to the quarters in @entity17 speaking to @entity24 , he said : ' i do n’t think any team were better than @entity5 at the @entity8 in @entity27 ( where he led them to the quarter - finals )			1
' i do n’t believe @entity5 have the chance to win this time			2
' the quarter - finals would be a good achievement			0
' following a 0 - 0 draw with @entity36 , @entity5 were eliminated 3 - 1 on penalties eight years ago , with @entity39 winner @entity38 scoring the winning spot - kick			2
and the 66 - year - old @entity41 , who also led @entity5 to the last eight of @entity43 and the 2002 @entity8 during his five years at the helm , can not see @entity6 's men getting past that stage either			1
@entity46 managed a side containing @entity5 's so - called ' golden generation ' , with @entity49 as his captain and @entity51 up front			0
but that squad also included @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and , infamously , @entity56 who was called up despite not having made a first team appearance for @entity58 and he was an unused substitute in @entity27 , even when @entity51 broke down			0
@entity59 : @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 ) , @entity54 ( @entity64 ) @entity65 : @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , @entity68 ( @entity58 ) , @entity69 ( @entity67 ) , @entity70 ( @entity71 ) , @entity72 ( @entity58 ) , @entity73 ( @entity71 ) , @entity74 ( @entity64 ) @entity75 : @entity76 ( @entity64 ) , @entity49 ( captain , @entity78 ) , @entity79 ( @entity71 ) , @entity82 ( @entity71 ) , @entity81 ( @entity80 ) , @entity53 ( @entity61 ) , @entity83 ( @entity61 ) , @entity84 ( @entity61 ) , @entity55 ( @entity85 ) @entity86 : @entity87 ( @entity67 ) , @entity51 ( @entity88 ) , @entity89 ( @entity64 ) , @entity56 ( @entity58 ) @entity59 : @entity90 ( @entity63 ) , @entity91 ( @entity92 ) , @entity93 ( @entity94 ) @entity65 : @entity95 ( @entity64 ) , @entity96 ( @entity97 ) , @entity98 ( @entity71 ) , @entity99 ( @entity97 ) , @entity100 ( @entity67 ) , @entity101 ( @entity67 ) , @entity102 ( @entity103 ) @entity75 : @entity76 ( captain , @entity64 ) , @entity105 ( @entity58 ) , @entity79 ( unattached , formerly of @entity71 ) , @entity106 ( @entity64 ) , @entity107 ( @entity58 ) , @entity108 ( @entity63 ) , @entity109 ( @entity64 ) , @entity110 ( @entity103 ) , @entity111 ( @entity97 ) @entity86 : @entity112 ( @entity64 ) , @entity87 ( @entity67 ) , @entity113 ( @entity67 ) , @entity114 ( @entity64 ) golden generation ? @entity2 's @entity5 team which lined up against @entity36 in the 2006 quarter - final smile : 2006 full squad photo with @entity53 ( back left ) and @entity54 ( middle , fourth from right ) no hopers ? @entity6 ( front , fourth from right ) with his 2014 @entity5 @entity8 squad but now only captain @entity76 , midfield veteran @entity79 and @entity67 striker @entity87 remain as @entity6 attempts to remodel his squad around youth			1
the @entity41 is convinced that his side , unlike @entity6 's , had a genuine chance of winning the @entity8			1
@entity2 said : ' we lost on penalties again but i do n’t think @entity36 - or any team - were better than us at that time			2
the margins are very small			0
' this time @entity5 has changed a lot , with new players			0
' i think they will go through the group stage and then it depends on who they meet			0
' celebrate : @entity2 's team had @entity49 ( left ) , @entity87 ( centre ) and @entity76 ( right ) unlucky : @entity2 says that no side in the world were better than his @entity5 team in 2006 heartbreak : @entity38 's penalty knocked @entity5 out of the @entity8 in @entity27 2006			1

@entity2 *insists* his side could have won the @entity8 in 2006
he says that no side were better than his , including @entity36
the @entity41 does not think *current* crop of @entity5 players can win though
he believes it is a *transition* period and they do not have the experience
