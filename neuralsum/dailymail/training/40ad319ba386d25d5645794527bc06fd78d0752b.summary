by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 kids are consuming more than two serves of fatty food and at least one sugary drink each day , which is directly having an impact on their weight gain			1
a long - term @entity12 study also found for each unhealthy item consumed by children , their @entity10 score increased			1
the new study looked at 4,164 children from ages four to 10 , with data collected over four time periods every two years			1
it classed fatty foods as hamburgers , hot chips , potato chips , doughnuts , cake or chocolate			0
sugary drinks included cordial , soft drinks and fruit juice			0
a @entity32 university study has found children are eating more than two serves of fatty foods and consuming at least one sugary drink a day it found six - years - olds consumed 1.4 serves of sugary drinks a day and 1.9 serves of fatty foods			1
at 10 years , this increased to 1.5 serves per day for sugary drinks			1
@entity43 for @entity45 's dr @entity44 said many would say ' yes we already know this ' , but studies to date had been inconclusive			0
' some [ found ] a connection between sugary drinks and fatty foods and children â€™s weight and others not , ' she said			2
' we have conducted a very robust study , and for the first time found that these foods and drinks independently contribute to childhood obesity			2
' dr @entity44 said the study showed that consuming snack foods had become ' normalised ' for children and she was shocked by the results			0
' i did n't think kids on average would eat that much unhealthy food , ' she said			0
the new study looked at 4,164 children from ages four to 10 , with data collected over four time periods every two years ' i thought they may have days when they 'd just have fruit , vegetables and meat and other healthy food , rather than snack food each day			1
' for each drink or high fat food consumed , the children 's @entity10 - z score - a standardised @entity10 measure used specifically with children - increased by 0.015 and 0.014 units respectively			1
' while the increases may seem low , they are cause for concern , ' dr @entity44 said			0
dr @entity44 said a normal @entity10 - z score would be zero , so a score above one was considered overweight and above two was obese			2
one in four @entity3 children are overweight or obese and this issue is more than an individual 's responsibility , she said			0
' it 's about providing a healthy environment for a child and making it easier for them to eat healthy food and be healthy people , ' dr @entity44 said .			0

it is the first time unhealthy eating has been linked directly to weight gain
the @entity32 university study looked at 4,000 kids between four and 10
@entity113 was collected from them over four time periods every two years
it found for each unhealthy item consumed a child 's @entity10 score increased
