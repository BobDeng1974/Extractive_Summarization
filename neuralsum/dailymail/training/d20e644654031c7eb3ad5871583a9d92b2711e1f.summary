in a lot of countries across @entity3 , the holding midfielder is the position for artists , those who effortlessly set the tone and tempo of a game			1
@entity9 , for one , has made the role an art form			1
@entity12 does it majestically for @entity14 and @entity15 , while @entity16 and @entity17 are others who have flourished in the role of being their team ’s orchestrator , getting everyone to play at their rhythm			1
in @entity26 , however , the holding midfielder has been more about breaking up play and protecting the defence			1
go back through the years and you ’ll see the national team has lacked a figure who has been happy to sit in and get the team moving forward			2
@entity34 played in a deeper midfield role in @entity26 's 2 - 0 victory in @entity37 @entity34 has struggled to kick on in @entity39 's set - up with injury and form problems we produce those who go box to box — think @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 — or scufflers like @entity50 in 1966			1
they produce scrappers in @entity3 , too , such as @entity53 and @entity54 , while @entity55 does that role today , but we have never had anyone in that class			0
when i played for @entity26 ’s @entity60 , i was a holding midfielder but my task was hunting down the opposition ’s @entity62			1
by contrast , the opposition ’s main man was always holding and i ’ll never forget facing @entity68 ’s @entity67 at the 1997 under 20 @entity69 in @entity70			0
@entity67 was so good he always had space to do what he wanted			0
it was as if he was making time stand still , plotting where he would ping his next pass			0
that is what a high - class holding midfielder can do but , for whatever reason , @entity26 have n’t produced that kind of player in modern times			1
could that be about to change ? @entity84 sprang a surprise by selecting @entity34 at the base of his diamond in @entity37			1
how did you feel he played ? personally , i thought he did ok , but it might be that he needs to get used to it in order to find his niche for club and country as the position we expect him to fill is not there at the moment			0
@entity34 emerged as someone who likes to burst past players and get forward but , during the time he has been out injured , @entity106 has made the attacking midfield role his own at @entity39 , with lots of goals and dynamic performances			1
if @entity26 are going to retain a diamond , you would n’t look to use @entity34 in the roles @entity113 and @entity114 fulfilled in @entity115 , as i do n’t think he has their dynamism or energy			1
equally , i do n’t think he ’d be comfortable playing with his back to goal , like the impressive @entity120			0
@entity34 trains at @entity39 's base at @entity122 ahead of their meeting with @entity124 but dropping deeper ? it could work			1
one of @entity34 ’s qualities , aside from his skill , is his aggression			2
i remembered that from when i watched him stand out during @entity39 ’s @entity130 final win over @entity131 in 2009 and it was evident when i first played against him			2
@entity34 was only 18 when he lined up against us on the opening day of the 2010 - 11 season but , aside from being comfortable in possession , he was fearless , driving into challenges whenever the ball was there to be won			2
trust me , he knows how to tackle			0
he has that in his armoury but @entity34 , to maximise his opportunities , might have to learn the finer details of being a holding midfielder			1
@entity9 mastered the deeper role and tormented @entity26 at the @entity69 earlier this year @entity17 has adapted his game to play in a deeper role for @entity147 and @entity148 @entity12 ( centre ) plays in a deep midfield role for both @entity14 and @entity15 he would have to be more disciplined and stop running with the ball , for instance , as that would invite danger			1
those short , sharp bursts have been a trademark for @entity34 but they probably have n’t helped with some of the injuries he has sustained			2
think about it : if you keep running with the ball , you become more susceptible to being hit by heavy challenges			0
the point is @entity26 do not have many to choose from in that role			1
@entity164 could play it but enough @entity26 managers have looked at him and not been convinced ; @entity167 continues to do well for @entity168 but his time appears to have gone			2
@entity55 , pictured playing for @entity68 , made his name as a ball - winning central midfielder other options would be @entity174 , if a man - marking job needed to be done on a world - class no 10 , or perhaps @entity178 , but the concern would be why @entity180 sold him if he was truly international class			0
so it may be that @entity34 has to learn the role and it can be done			2
@entity9 started as a @entity62 but @entity184 experimented by bringing him back at @entity185			2
@entity17 was converted from being a winger by @entity187 , while @entity188 dropped back to control games for @entity190			2
you would n’t say any of those players , or some mentioned earlier , were outstanding defensively			0
@entity106 ( left ) has made the attacking midfield role at @entity39 his own with some impressive showings @entity113 ( left ) and @entity114 ( right ) provided a lot of energy in midfield against @entity37 maybe what happened to @entity34 in @entity37 was for the best , as i do n’t believe he is a player you would yet describe , for all his ability , as being one of your first names on the teamsheet , either for @entity39 or @entity26			1
to excel in the role , he would have to improve his range of passing but it is encouraging to hear he is watching videos , working out what he needs to do to fulfil the expectations many have for him			0
time will tell whether he would be suited to playing in that role in the hurly - burly of the @entity217 , particularly in a contest like saturday 's against @entity124 , and maybe he would be more suited to it at international level			2
@entity120 has thrived in an advanced , central role for @entity131 and now for @entity26 some would argue that he is n’t suited to the position , that he should be used further forward , but others have more powerful claims to operate in those roles at this time			1
who knows ? in the future we might talk of @entity34 as @entity26 ’s conductor - in - chief			1
@entity230 will relish return of famous @entity233 nights playing at @entity233 on a @entity234 night is one of the best experiences in football and my old ground will be full on tuesday			0
it is great that @entity131 are back in that competition and nobody will be looking forward to the meeting with @entity244 side @entity243 more than @entity230 , who has been working relentlessly to get his team back on this stage			1
@entity247 celebrates a famous @entity234 win for @entity131 over @entity249 at @entity233 @entity131 manager @entity230 shares a joke with @entity113 and @entity47 in training starting this evening , though , is a period when a lot of questions will be asked of @entity230 and his squad and they will be scrutinised to see how they cope with the challenge of keeping the team near the top of the table and competitive in @entity3			1
he has some injuries to contend with but that will not stop @entity131 supporters thinking that they are going to win the next three games — saturday ’s match against @entity267 and a trip to @entity269 sandwich the @entity243 fixture — over the next seven days			0
there is no doubt @entity273 will have to rotate and it will be crucial that he makes the right decisions at the right times			0
this schedule shows why @entity131 made so many signings during the summer but fitting them all into the right blend will determine if they can continue to be successful			0
@entity279 , pictured in training , was brought in to provide added depth and competition for @entity131 @entity283 is out for up to three weeks after picking up an injury while on international duty with @entity26 what i 'm looking forward to this week ... seeing how @entity187 manages to make it all work			1
i have been reading a book by @entity292 journalist @entity290 on @entity293 and one line sticks in my mind			0
@entity293 says that he does not ‘ pick the 11 best ’ when selecting his team but he ‘ picks the best 11 ’ and it will be intriguing to see how he moulds everything together for @entity190			0
@entity190 manager @entity187 unveils new signings @entity300 ( left ) and @entity301 ( right ) @entity302 and @entity303 could find their places in the @entity190 first team come under threat after an extraordinary end to the summer window , when they smashed the @entity312 transfer record with their £ 60million purchase of @entity314 and then signed @entity301 on loan , @entity293 has a squad to start making progress			1
@entity301 , for instance , is a brilliant addition to the @entity217 and if he recaptures the form he showed for @entity323 — his performance against @entity249 in the 2012 @entity321 is still in my mind — he will transform @entity190			0
but if 50 people sat down and tried to pick a team for the game against @entity327 on sunday , i ’d say there would be countless formations and few would have the same names			0
@entity314 , who joined in a @entity312 record £ 60m fee from @entity333 , made his debut against @entity335 if @entity293 is going to make things tick for @entity190 , he is going to have to make some high - profile and tough decisions with his team selection			0
the biggest one of all is how will he possibly get @entity301 , @entity303 and @entity302 in the same team ? should he continue to live by his rule of not picking ‘ the 11 best ’ , there are going to be some disappointed stars in @entity190 ’s dressing room			0
how @entity293 handles that will be key .			0

@entity34 was used in a deeper role for @entity26 against @entity37
*creative* players like @entity9 fill that role on the continent
in @entity26 , a holding midfielder breaks up play and protects the back four
@entity34 is *n't* well suited to an advanced role in a diamond *system*
this week is a big test for @entity131 and their squad depth
@entity187 has to work out a way of getting his big guns in the team
