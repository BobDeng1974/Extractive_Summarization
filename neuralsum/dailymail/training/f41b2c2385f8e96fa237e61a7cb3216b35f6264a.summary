he said : ‘ there ’s a massive disparity in the figures			0
the overwhelming majority of that funding is for @entity25 and the @entity26			2
‘ the question symbolises an issue that many people in the @entity17 have with the relative funding of the @entity23			2
‘ brass bands may be perceived as working - class and opera as middle and upper - class things			1
