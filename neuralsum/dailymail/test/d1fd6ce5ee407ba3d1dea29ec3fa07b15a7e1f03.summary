in @entity4 , the secret to forging super-light and strong @entity2 steel swords was said to have been lost with the doom of @entity6			1
but , despite its fictional basis , a scientist has investigated whether it would be possible to make a similar weapon using bona fide chemistry			2
by studying the composition of modern steel , welding techniques and assessing all the characteristics of @entity2 steel , he concludes it is n't a steel at all , but instead is a metal matrix composite			1
@entity28 , played in the @entity30 adaptation of the books by @entity32 , had a @entity2 sword called @entity34 ( pictured ) the findings and conclusions were made by materials scientist @entity37 in the latest reactions video for @entity40 - based @entity39			1
according to @entity42 's books , @entity2 steel is a form of metal forged when the @entity25 governed @entity26 , and covered more than half the known world			1
it reigned for 5,000 years before a disaster struck the empire , known as the ' doom of @entity6 '			0
a lot of the empire 's military strength came from its ability to forge @entity2 steel , renowned in the fictional kingdoms as being incredibly sharp , light , strong , super heat - resistant and dark in colour with a very distinct ripple patterns			1
the fictional @entity2 steel was renowned in the kingdoms as being incredibly sharp , light , strong , super heat resistant and dark in colour with a very distinct ripple patterns			1
it was reportedly forged using @entity65 magic and the secret to forging it was said to have been lost with the doom of @entity6 in the latest reactions video for the @entity39 , materials scientist @entity37 ( pictured ) studied which materials could create a similar sword			1
he began by looking at standard steel			0
steel is an alloy made mostly of iron , but also includes around 2 % of carbon according to @entity42 's books , @entity2 steel is a form of metal forged when the @entity25 governed @entity26 and covered more than half the known world			1
it reigned for five thousand years before a disaster struck the empire , known as the ' doom of @entity6 '			0

a dagger used by an assassin in an attempt to kill @entity100 was also made from @entity2 steel and had been lost in a bet by @entity102 to @entity103			1

as mr @entity37 explained in the video : ‘ in order to make " magic " steel we first need to know about real steel			2
' steel is an alloy - a combination of metal with one or more other elements			2
it is mostly iron , but also includes carbon - up to about 2 per cent			0
a small change in the quantity of material in an alloy can dramatically change the properties of the end material			0
' the characteristics of @entity2 steel can give us a lot of clues as to its composition , ' continued mr @entity37			1
' strength and sharpness is going to require a bit of a balancing act			0
in order to hold an edge , a blade has to be really hard which is no problem for a high - carbon steel			0
' the problem is the harder something is , the easier it will shatter , which is no good for a king slayer			0
' mr @entity37 first looked into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern , real - life version of @entity2 steel			1
it has 0.6 % carbon , with silicon and manganese			0
this would provide a balance of properties including a sharp edge , but a spring steel sword could n't handle high temperatures he then moved onto the option of using air hardened steel			2
it is cooled off in the open air when it ’s forged and does n't lose its properties when heated up			0
air hardened steel uses a ' cocktail of elements ' but as mr @entity37 added , @entity2 ’s colour , pattern and weight make this option unlikely he first looks into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern , real - life version of @entity2 steel			1
it has 0.6 per cent carbon , with silicon and manganese			0
this would provide a balance of properties including a sharp edge , it would bend without breaking and be really hard to shatter			0
but a spring steel sword could n't handle the high temperatures alluded to in the books			2

as an alternative , mr @entity37 suggests @entity2 steel is n’t steel at all			1
instead , the ' best possible match ' might be a metal matrix composite			1
this is a modern super material with a metallic framework embedded with ceramics , and one of these could provide all of the extreme characteristics needed for @entity2 steel he said itanium silicon carbide might be the ' perfect fit ' because it has the strength , weight and colour needed for @entity2 steel			1
and if the matrix was n’t consistent , it might have swirls of grey running through the blade author @entity42 was said to have been inspired by @entity215 ( pictured ) steel used during the crusades in @entity218 air hardened steel uses a ' cocktail of elements ' and as mr @entity37 added , ‘ you better believe it would require magic in the medieval world to get these materials working together			2
' but @entity2 ’s colour , pattern and weight make this option unlikely			2
for example , steel can always be polished to a grey , but @entity2 is supposed to be nearly black			2
on top of that , the weight of steel ca n't be changed as it 's mostly heavy iron			2
additionally , mr @entity37 said the patterns of @entity241 steel suggest it has been pattern welded , and folded			0
' this is n’t a sign of superb quality and strength , it ’s actually a way of compensating for poor materials and trying to make a good steel out of two bad ones , ' he said			0
' if the folding is done correctly , you do n’t have visible ripples so that ’s kind of out			0

instead , the ' best possible match ' might be a metal matrix composite			1
' this is a modern super material that has a metallic framework embedded with ceramics and one of these could provide all of the extreme characteristics needed for @entity2 steel , ' he continued			1
' a titanium silicon carbide might be the perfect fit			0
' it has the strength , weight and colour needed for @entity2 steel and if the matrix was n’t perfectly consistent , it might have swirls of grey running through the blade			1
' there is also the opinion that @entity2 is similar to @entity281 steel			1
mr @entity42 was said to have been inspired by the patterns and properties of the legendary @entity281 steel used during the crusades in @entity218 across the 11th century for the books			0
it is made from iron ore steel called wootz and , like with the fictional @entity2 , the forging techniques used to make the distinctive blades were believed to have been lost in the mid- 18th century .			2

in @entity4 , @entity2 steel was forged during the @entity293
it is said to be sharp , light , strong , heat resistant and dark with patterns
scientist has studied which materials could create a similar , real life sword
and concludes it 's not a steel at all , but is instead a metal matrix composite
