the parents of an 18 - year - old boy who suffered a devastating brain haemorrhage while diving for cray fish have hailed his recovery a ‘ miracle ’ after doctors told them their son would not survive and set the wheels in motion for his organs to be donated			1
@entity13 and his son @entity14 were out diving near their home at @entity19 ’s @entity18 , @entity20 , one saturday morning when the experienced diver told his father he had a headache and was heading back to the boat			1
‘ i did n’t think too much of it because i thought it was shallow water blackout , ’ @entity13 told @entity25			1
doctors believed @entity29 , seen here in intensive care , had no chance of surviving bleeding on the brain this photo of @entity14 was taken two days before his bleed out on 23 october at his final school assembly where @entity14 was deputy head boy ‘ we tend to get a bit of a head rush when we push ourselves too hard … but when two friends shouted out to say goodaye to @entity14 he said he had really bad headache and started vomiting over the boat			1
’ @entity13 had no idea that an @entity45 ( @entity45 ) in @entity14 's brain which had been lying dormant since his birth had ruptured and caused life threatening bleeding			1
he rushed his son to the emergency department at @entity51 on october 25 , while @entity14 drifted in and out of consciousness			2
‘ i knew something was wrong but did n’t think it was to the point of death , ’ @entity13 recalled			1
‘ while in the car , i was just talking to him saying “ @entity14 you need to stay with me ” but still not recognising the desperation of the situation			0
’ when they reached the hospital @entity14 was quickly given a ct scan which discovered the @entity45 in his head			1
an @entity45 is described as a tangle of blood vessels in the brain or on its surface which bypasses normal brain tissue and directly diverts blood from the arteries to the vein			1
‘ the bleed was so extensive they said the outcome was n’t good … that became real to us and they asked whether we would be keen on donating @entity14 ’s organs , ’ @entity13 said			1
@entity14 is seen here on the left with his father @entity13 and elder brother @entity84 @entity14 's family including his mum @entity86 ( centre ) are closer than ever after the traumatic experience during the rush to the hospital @entity13 called his wife @entity86 and told her ‘ you better get to the hospital ’			1
‘ i just walked in and the look on the nurse ’s face said it all			2
she said “ come straight through on your own ” , ’ @entity86 remembered			0
‘ they took me through the curtains and a nurse came to me and said “ do n’t panic but it ’s confronting ”			2
she opened the curtains and he was on life support right at that moment i still did n’t realise how serious it was , i just thought maybe he ’d been hit on the head while coming up from the drive			0
’ @entity86 recalls thinking ‘ we were going to be late for his graduation dinner			0
’ ‘ he was going to be singing at the @entity115 dinner that night … i thought “ what the heck is going on ” … there was silence in the room with the doctors and nurses not saying much			2
‘ it just got worse , the feeling in the room got worse			0
’ this photo was taken of @entity14 as he finally left hospital on february 2 after three and a half months @entity14 and his father regularly go diving			1
in this photo he is seen spearfishing @entity13 and his wife @entity86 began praying and received a huge amount of support from their local and religious community and churches around the world			1
‘ the support has been tremendous ; way beyond anything we expected it was crazy , ’ @entity13 said			1
the doctors told @entity86 and @entity13 more scans had shown a massive bleed on the brain and a top neurosurgeon in @entity144 told them ‘ there is no chance of survival ’			1
‘ as a mum i felt like everything had all of a sudden drained form the top of me all the way to my feet			0
i felt faint and it just got worse			0
this week @entity14 got back on his paddle board for the first time since october doctors hope that @entity14 will be back to full health within two years and able to surf and dive again within six months ‘ the other doctor came in and said “ i know it ’s bad timing but we need to know if @entity14 would be happy to donate his organs ” , ’ @entity86 said			1
one of @entity86 ’s other two sons advised his mother that it was what @entity14 would have wanted and they began the process of moving him to @entity144 for his organs to be donated			1
‘ @entity14 and i got in the ambulance and about 30 people came to say goodbye , six of them very close friends , his grandparents and cousins			0
everybody came because they were told to say goodbye … it was tough to see all the boys crying			0
’ an air ambulance flew @entity14 and @entity86 to @entity144 where she held his hand the whole way and did n’t stop crying			1
‘ it was unbelievable and surreal and then i thought about his funeral , what he would like			0
i thought about his suit i had bought him			0
he had the school ball coming up , maybe he would n’t want to wear that to his funeral maybe he would want to wear boardies and a singlet ? ’ @entity86 remembered			0
‘ i had to be there i could n’t let him go on his own			0
’ it was when @entity14 reached @entity144 that the unimaginable happened			2
@entity14 planned to perform at his school graduation before the freak incident the 18 - year - old is seen in recovery here with his two elder brothers while a nurse did routine checks for any movement @entity14 miraculously responded			1
‘ she said “ you might want to turn away now ” and she pushed really hard on his chest			0
he responded quiet strongly so i heard her say “ i ’m sorry darling ” , ’ @entity86 said			2
not long after that @entity13 and their middle son @entity84 , 19 , arrived at the hospital , where their oldest son @entity209 , 22 , was too			1
‘ we were all in the room together , the five of us			0
the neurosurgeon came in and gave us a glimmer of hope as @entity14 had responded to the chest pain … he said “ we ’re willing to give it a go to try and save him ” , ’ @entity86 said			2
a tense seven hour operation with no guarantees followed and finally at around 3am the family got the call to say @entity14 had made it			0
@entity86 held her son @entity14 's hand the whole way to @entity144 and did n’t stop crying @entity14 's mother @entity86 told of the amazing moment the neurosurgeon told the family that @entity14 had responded for the first time ‘ it was then a good two weeks of up and down … it was a slow progress but it finally came , @entity14 responded to commands to squeeze the nurse ’s hand			1
’ ‘ it ’s a miracle , he ’s @entity19 ’s own @entity236 … it was very much @entity237 saying " did n’t i tell you that i believed you would see the glory of @entity239 " , ’ @entity13 said			2
amazingly @entity14 has suffered no serious brain damage and doctors predict he will be fully recovered within two years with therapy			1
‘ i cried every day for three weeks			0
every time i saw him it was heart wrenching … to think something like that can change in a moment			0
i ’d just told him off about cleaning his room , ’ @entity86 said			0
four months on , @entity14 has returned to the ocean to paddle board and once he ’s got the all - clear from doctors it ’s hoped he will be able to drive and dive again within six months			2
‘ he ’s very grateful for his life because there was a point when everything went down and he was in a dingy by himself			0
he thought “ i ’m going to die , this is the end ”			0
‘ he is very much aware that his life has been spared for a reason for a purpose and he ’s very grateful for his life and very thankful to @entity239 , ’ @entity13 said of his son @entity14			2
the family said the traumatic experience has brought them closer together .			0
