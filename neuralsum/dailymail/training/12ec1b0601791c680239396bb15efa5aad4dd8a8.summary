by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 14 april 2012 updated : 06:56 est , 15 april 2012 he was the debonair black - clad hero who risked life and limb to deliver chocolates to his beloved – and all because the lady loved @entity7			2
but it seems both ladies and their would - be paramours are more likely to turn up their noses at a box of the iconic @entity14 chocolates these days amid complaints about quality and flavour			1
websites and social networking forums have been inundated with concerns about the poor taste of the chocolates and claims that old favourites have been reformulated or dropped completely			1
wrong selection : the new @entity7 box has left many customers angry by the poor choice of chocolates			2
the orange crescent and hazelnut whirl , both circled , are at the centre of the storm the complaints have surfaced two years after the controversial £ 11 billion takeover of @entity14 by @entity37 food giant @entity36			1
there is particular outrage about the orange truffle , a replacement for the traditional orange cream			1
consumers say that the modern crescent - shaped version is a poor imitation of its rich , creamy pre-decessor with only a hint of orange flavour			1
the hazelnut whirl has also been the subject of vigorous debate , with many claiming it has been reformulated and its distinctive hard - edged grooves replaced with softer whirls			1
meanwhile , eagle - eyed shoppers have also noticed the absence of coffee creams and mocha - flavoured chocolates , and bemoaned the loss of the paper menu from boxes , once delivered by action man @entity63 in the iconic @entity65 adverts			2
instead , they point out that there are now four different caramel chocolates and three separate hazel - nut sweets in a standard 7.05oz ( 200g ) box			2
iconic : @entity63 as the black - clad hero delivering @entity7 in the @entity71 was a hit television advert on social networking site @entity74 , @entity73 wrote on april 9 : ‘ @entity14 milk tray chocolates are vile ! # disappointed			1
’ two days later , fellow user @entity77 added : ‘ @entity7 is so cheap these days			2
it does n’t seem the luxury product it was in my youth			2
’ on a specialist food review website on april 8 , an anonymous man described how he was given a box of @entity7 as an @entity84 gift from his wife			1
‘ i was really looking forward to the lovely creamy taste of the chocolate and the creamy flavours of the various creme centres , ’ he began			1
then he fumed : ‘ what a disappointment ! they were absolute rubbish			2
the chocolate was not at all smooth and left a nasty aftertaste in the mouth			1
the old creme fillings have either been completely eliminated , as with the orange flavour , or have been completely changed in taste			1
the coffee - flavoured chocs have disappeared completely			2
dedication : the craggy chocolate box clutching hero jumped from helicopters , skied over cliffs and abseiled across our screens for 26 years ‘ i shall not be buying any more of these chocolates ever again			1
’ another contributor commented : ‘ rubbish ! they certainly were n’t like the @entity7 that i remember [ delicious and full of flavour ]			2
they all tasted more or less the same , very artificial and certainly not a lot of variety			2
‘ the box looks impressive but the contents leave a lot to be desired and i certainly wo n’t be buying them again ! ’ another , who signed herself meledna , remarked on april 16 last year : ‘ i can describe them in two words			0
’ there are also accusations on the websites that @entity36 is responsible for the changes			0
but @entity36 insists that any changes to ingredients and production methods predate the takeover , and go back to 2007			0
at the time of @entity36 ’s hostile bid for @entity14 , there was a public outcry and more than 20,000 @entity136 readers backed this newspaper ’s campaign to ‘ keep @entity139 ’			1
there were concerns that the quality of the chocolate would suffer if operations were taken over by the @entity37 company			1
buyout : manufacturers @entity14 were taken over by @entity37 food giant @entity36 for £ 11 billion many worried about the loss of another historic @entity150 brand and the potential loss of jobs in the @entity150 prompted by the takeover			1
when @entity155 - based @entity36 succeeded in its takeover early in 2010 , it was criticised by mps for reneging on a promise to keep open a factory near @entity160			0
the move resulted in the loss of hundreds of jobs as production moved to @entity165			0
@entity36 boss @entity166 , dubbed the ‘ @entity169 ’ because of the firm ’s other famous product , refused to fly to @entity150 to answer questions over the u-turn			0
@entity36 has also been allowed to keep the @entity172 on @entity7 boxes , an award first given to @entity14 by @entity175 in 1854			1
the decision follows detailed consideration by the @entity178			0
secretary @entity179 explained : ‘ a @entity172 is granted to a company , and it may well be that company manufactures the product abroad – but that ’s the way the market works these days			1
‘ in the case of @entity14 , when it was acquired by @entity36 it was looked at very carefully and the situation was considered and accepted			1
’ @entity36 last night defended @entity7 , which enjoys sales worth £ 20 million in the @entity150 every year			0
@entity189 , head of external communications at @entity191 , said : ‘ we have not seen any increase in complaints about @entity7			0
‘ we conduct extensive scientific consumer research and are constantly checking on people ’s likes , dislikes and hates			0
’ mr @entity189 added : ‘ @entity198 and strawberry chocolates have changed because in 2007 we moved away from artificial colourings and we no longer use them in our products			0
‘ @entity198 oil is now used to flavour the orange chocolate and straw - berries for the strawberry one			1
’ he also conceded that the hazelnut whirl had changed ‘ because of different machinery in the @entity165 factory ’			1
he added that ‘ consumers have told us they do n’t like hard edges on chocolates , so there are smoother curves on the hazelnut ’			1
@entity36 said the paper menu had been discontinued as part of their commitment to reduce unnecessary packaging			0
verdict by @entity222 just what have they gone and done ? to @entity7 , i mean , the box of chocolates so damned sophisticated they were delivered by a superspy clad in a superfine cashmere polo neck			0
he skied down vertical slopes , powered speedboats over @entity235 baddies and waterfalls , hung from creaking cable cars , dived from cliffs , dodged sharks and all because … the lady loved @entity7			0
ok , despite the sub @entity243 - as - @entity244 adverts , these were resolutely democratic chocolates			0
choc choice : @entity222 is switching to rival @entity248 's @entity247 from now instead of classic @entity7 modest too , not the sort to boast about high cocoa content , or @entity252 beans			0
and all the better for it – far preferable to those snooty @entity254 and upwardly - mobile @entity255			0
i bow to no one in my love for @entity258			0
and the joy of @entity7 used to be lashings of the stuff , draped across over-sweet , garish pink strawberry centres and lurid orange creams			1
you were n’t looking for natural essences and hand - crafted pieces , but rather solid , reliable chocolate			1
now , though , in their new - look box , every single piece seems to taste the same			0
@entity272 , turgid and slightly greasy			0
the ‘ hazelnut heaven ’ sees a pretty paltry nut buried in a waxy , dog - choc - like mound of chocolate mud			1
‘ @entity198 truffle ’ is a sorry excuse , with only the very faintest whisper of citrus			2
i ’m not sure what the ‘ nut secret ’ is hiding , but one nibble is more than enough			0
‘ honey love ’ might be a half - decent name for a @entity244 girl			0
in a chocolate , though , it ’s debased , like chewing on beeswax lip balm			2
in fact , the only two that come close to the old - fashioned favourites are the ‘ eastern delight ’ ( the chocolate formerly known as @entity298			1
) and an ok - ish ‘ caramel charm ’			0
even these two rays of relative light ca n’t escape the curse of that cheap , nasty chocolate covering			2
the sad truth is that these taste more like @entity37 chocolate than @entity150			1
and as anyone who has ever suffered the rank indignities of @entity310 ’s and its ilk know only too well , this is very bad news indeed			0
@entity14 say the chocolates are ‘ made in the @entity312 ’			1
it seems the process has long departed this sceptred isle			0
the only really good news is that the cursed coffee one has been given the boot			0
but too little , too late			0
from now on , it ’s @entity247 all the way .			0

concerns over quality of chocolate and claims favourites have been dropped
