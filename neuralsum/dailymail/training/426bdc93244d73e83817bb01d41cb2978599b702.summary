@entity1 police are under pressure not only for the killing of an unarmed teenager in @entity5 , @entity6 - for which a grand jury decided yesterday not to indict the officer - but also for the military - style response to the sometimes violent protests that followed			0
the sight in august of police in camouflage gear , backed up by armoured vehicles and brandishing assault rifles , was a reminder that some @entity1 police departments have recently acquired @entity1 military - surplus hardware from wars abroad			0
yet many other law enforcers around the world have rules of engagement that allow lethal force to be used relatively freely			2
power : @entity26 police officers from the @entity27 pose for a picture in their base outside the capital city @entity31 armed : @entity33 special forces pose for a photograph with an armoured vehicle and working dog outside their headquarters in central @entity38 padded : a member of the @entity41 bomb squad stands with a bomb scanner and padded suit at a police station in @entity45 lightly armed : @entity47 police officers pose with light bullet - proof vests and assault rifles outside a base in @entity51 smart : @entity55 police constables @entity53 and @entity56 pose for a photograph wearing their @entity58 beat uniforms @entity62 's @entity61 decrees that , when peaceful methods of resolution have failed , police must warn violent demonstrators that there will be a ' progressive , differentiated use of force '			1
while no firearms must be carried for peaceful demonstrations , when things turn violent , the emphasis is on avoiding harm to children , pregnant women and the elderly			0
@entity47 's police , often themselves the target of armed attacks , are officially authorised to respond with weapons ' and explosives ' , albeit only after other methods have failed , and no fewer than six warnings have been issued			1
but for every regulation that gives police wide scope to use firearms , there is another code that sharply limits their use			0
@entity95 and @entity96 riot police follow defined escalation protocols that go from verbal warnings to physical constraint , tear gas , water cannon or pepper spray , rubber bullets or baton rounds , and then use of firearms			2
ready for work : members of @entity33 's special forces pose for pictures at their headquarters in central @entity38 rounds : a group of @entity114 ( @entity115 ) team officers pose outside a @entity117 police station transport : a @entity120 national police officer poses for a picture with a patrol segway motorcycle in front of a police station in @entity45 @entity127 's public order police , the @entity125 , are seen wearing riot control equipment at their headquarters in @entity130 @entity131 : two @entity131 police officers are seen posing in front of a water cannon in @entity135			1
left , the officer wears the kind of full combat wear used in life threatening missions			2
right , another officer wears clothing and body armour used in a riot situation rank and file : @entity131 police officers pose in various uniforms in front of a water cannon at their headquarters in @entity135 yet while @entity95 police commanders can decide when to escalate , @entity96 's @entity151 requires approval from an on - the - spot magistrate for each new step			1
many countries spell out that any use of firearms is a last resort , though this can be defined many ways			0
@entity162 , @entity26 , @entity163 and the @entity120 allow guns to be fired only if a life is at risk			1
@entity162 stands out for its insistence that ' individual officers are accountable and responsible for any use of force and must be able to justify their actions in law '			1
other @entity174 countries , meanwhile , allow firearms to be used ' where necessary ' to detain suspects or to prevent a serious crime			0
@entity179 : members of the @entity181 for @entity182 pose for a photograph in an empty car park outside their base lineup : various ranks of the @entity181 for @entity182 pose for a photograph with their armoured vehicles and a working dog @entity62 national police officers pose for a picture with their riot equipment in @entity194			0
they stand next to a mannequin dressed in uniform no body armour : members of the @entity200 security forces pose in front of the @entity200 @entity174 headquarters in @entity203 tough : @entity47 policeman @entity204 , 24 , poses for photo in @entity51			1
he wears no body armour and carries an old - fashioned assault rifle police at the extraterritorial @entity200 buildings in @entity203 are not subject to @entity211 law but still conform to local police rules			1
these rules , like those governing police in @entity216 , @entity131 , @entity33 and @entity163 , specify that the use of force must be ' proportionate '			2
in @entity33 , human rights monitors say , this means firearms can never be used for crowd control			0
@entity127 's @entity125 , the main riot force , is permitted to use firearms only when protesters are using them , but it is in a fortunate position			0
its deputy superintendent , @entity227 , says that ' firearms have not been used in the 59 years since the @entity125 was formed '			0
mighty : members of the @entity163 @entity232 pose for photo in front of their base in the town of @entity237 defence brigade : @entity96 's @entity151 ( @entity240 ) personnel pose for pictures inside their base camp in @entity243 an @entity96 police constable stands guard next to an armoured vehicle outside the police commissioner 's office in @entity249 @entity55 police constable @entity53 ( left ) poses for a photograph while wearing his @entity58 uniform with a high visibility jacket			1
his colleague @entity56 ( right ) wears the more traditional @entity58 beat uniform , used for daytime street patrols picturesque : @entity216 @entity257 pose in front of @entity259 in @entity260 as a @entity257 helicopter flies overhead highly skilled : @entity26 gendarmerie officers pose near a building used for training outside their base in @entity31			2

special forces in @entity26 and @entity163 carry huge weapons and wear *intimidating* black masks and body armour
meanwhile officers in @entity47 and @entity96 wear *considerably* lighter clothing , offering much less protection
@entity162 stands out for its insistence that individual officers must be able to justify their use of force
