many people wonder what the secret to long - lasting love is but hours of soul searching might be a waste of time if new research is to be believed			2
whilst mutual trust , loyalty and a shared love of @entity13 might spring to mind , @entity9 mathematicians have revealed three rather more humble questions to determine whether a couple have real potential			1
in an interview for the book @entity43 : how @entity46 do what they do and how they do it so well , the site ’s four founders offer insight into what they believe makes a relationship work			0
and it seems they do have the knowledge because as @entity9 mathematicians they are very keen on data and wanted to build a ‘ compatibility algorithm ’ site based on survey questions , according to website @entity59			1
and these three questions above all others seemed to determine if you and someone else have long - term potential			0
' have you ever traveled around another country alone , ' and ' would you pack it all in to go and live on a sailboat , ' are two questions that determine whether you and your partner are compatible			0
share exactly the same answer and you could be perfect for each other according to the , if you find someone that answers all three of the questions the same way you do , the two of you are a perfect match			0
they also revealed the most successful online dating poses and what turns users off immediately			2
apparently , when it comes to messaging , reply rates plummet if there is bad spelling and bad grammar			0
interestingly , buzzwords such as ‘ awesome ’ and ‘ fascinating ’ prove much more popular than physical compliments like ‘ sexy ’ and ‘ beautiful			0
’ the best pose for men is ' mysterious and sexy , ' looking off camera and not smiling , whereas women who hold the camera above their head and look coy and flirty receive more hits			1
women looking away from camera , as if they are flirting with someone else , get the least interest , say the experts			2
and another question men should always ask ? whether his prospective date likes the taste of beer			1
according to the mathematicians , if she says yes then she is 30 % more likely to sleep with him on the first date than women who say no.			1

mathematicians reveal what you should ask if looking for love
the @entity9 experts are brains behind dating website ok @entity40
' have you ever travelled alone ? ' is another *key* question
also reveal that men believe women who like beer are more likely to sleep with them on the first date
