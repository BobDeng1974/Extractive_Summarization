by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor thousands of people will die from extreme heat because health and safety rules stop hospitals opening windows , a shocking report claims			1
new research suggests the number of deaths during scorching @entity13 summers is set to treble to 7,000 by the 2050s			1
houses , hospitals and care homes are ill - equipped to deal with a heatwave , sparking calls for a maximum temperature to be imposed on wards			1
top - floor flats and terraced houses are particularly at risk of overheating because of insulation and difficulting opening windows , the report said the combination of an ageing population and climate change increasing the likelihood of extreme heatwaves means thousands more people are at risk			1
the @entity36 , which advises government on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , said more needed to be done to adapt to rising temperatures			2
by 2040 half of all summers will be as hot as 2003 , when 2,000 people died			0
it warns of an increase in droughts , strong winds and wildfires , while ‘ many homes , hospitals and care homes are already at risk of overheating ’			1
it suggests that the @entity58 should ‘ consider setting standards for maximum temperatures in hospitals and make sure staff can control internal temperatures ’			2
around 90 per cent of hospital wards are prone to overheating , and the ability to control temperatures is often limited			1
@entity64 , chairman of the @entity36 , the country needs to adapt homes to cope with heatwaves staff have only limited control over conditions because window opening has been restricted over health and safety fears , according to soon - to - be - published @entity74 research			1
the work on hospitals has been led by professor of architecture @entity77 whose research group has been looking at ways to cool wards without resorting to costly air conditioning which could exacerbate the climate problem , it found that while the @entity86 advocates natural ventilation for wards and offices , the policy was often thwarted because window opening had been restricted over fears about safety , infection control and security			2
the cost of installing the necessary improvements across 627 buildings was put at around £ 17.5 billion			0
@entity64 , chairman of the @entity36 , said : ' there is more to be done to counter the increasing risks of severe weather that are likely to be associated with climate change			2
' as well as making vital infrastructure services more resilient to flooding and storms , the country needs to adapt homes and other buildings so they are suitable for higher summer temperatures			0
' the impacts of climate change on the @entity13 in the decades ahead are likely to include rising sea levels , more flooding , summer heatwaves , and perhaps more frequent storms and droughts			0
’ newer homes are more likely to overheat			0
top - floor flats and terraced houses are particularly at risk , as well as homes because they struggle to create a through - flow of air			2
‘ examples of causes of overheating included improperly ventilated communal areas in blocks of flats , and an inability to open windows , ’ the report said			0
source : @entity133 of summertime temperatures and overheating risk source : @entity133 of summertime temperatures and overheating risk reducing indoor temperatures by 1 - @entity139 can cut annual heat - related mortality by 30 - 70 per cent			1
while better roof insulation and window upgrades can cool a room by @entity144 , insulated floors and walls can push temperatures up by @entity148			0
to fit new and exitsing homes with air conditioning would cost £ 2.4billion over 15 years			0
cheaper alternatives include shutting curtains during the day , applying tinted window film and painting roofs white .			0
