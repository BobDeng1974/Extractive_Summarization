a growing rift between @entity1 and his @entity3 chief has sparked new fears that the @entity6 campaign is in crisis			2
labour insiders say relations between mr @entity1 and chief strategist @entity10 are so bad , they are barely on speaking terms			1
@entity1 's allies have accused mr @entity10 of ' sulking ' after @entity1 put @entity13 in charge of day - to - day campaigning in the election			1
@entity10 's friends have hit back , claiming he is ' frustrated ' by @entity1 's ' inability to act decisively '			1
labour insiders say relations between mr @entity1 and chief strategist @entity10 ( pictured right ) are so bad , they are barely on speaking terms with just over five months to go before the @entity22 on may 7 , shadow cabinet ministers fear the fallout could rob them of victory			1
a well - placed source said : ' the tension is palpable when @entity1 and @entity10 are together			1
@entity10 talks down to @entity1 and @entity27 bristles at it			1
' @entity10 does n't think @entity1 pays enough attention to his ideas			2
it is madness when the polls suggest that the next election will be such a close - run thing			0
' the source added : ' they need to put egos and past squabbles to one side and work together for the sake of the party			0
' when @entity1 gave the election post to @entity10 it was seen as a way of healing the rift caused by @entity10 's role in running @entity49 's failed bid to beat his brother to the @entity6 leadership in 2010			1
but party sources say that , if anything , relations between the two men are even worse now			0
although @entity10 and @entity1 worked closely together for @entity56 , @entity10 is seen as a ' @entity57 ' compared to left - winger @entity1			1
@entity10 , mr @entity56 's former speech writer , held several @entity59 positions in the @entity61 and @entity56 governments			2
more recently , he came under fire for @entity6 's lacklustre campaign during the @entity65 referendum – which was rescued by @entity56 's 11th - hour intervention			0
@entity10 's @entity22 plan has also been challenged by @entity68			1
some say his ' 35 per cent ' strategy , whereby @entity6 sets out to win its ' core vote ' but does not woo @entity72 , is ' too defensive			0
' similarly , his claim that @entity6 has little to fear from @entity74 has been challenged by new evidence that @entity76 is eating into the party 's support			0
with just over five months to go before the general election on may 7 , shadow cabinet ministers fear the fallout between the pair could rob them of victory mr @entity10 , seated next to @entity1 , during a meeting in the @entity85 of the @entity86 in june 2014 @entity1 's decision last month to put ms @entity13 in charge of day - to - day campaigning , with @entity10 still in overall control , was seen as an attempt to sideline @entity10			1
but @entity92 herself has been accused of ' naïve ' gaffes , including advising @entity95 not to discuss immigration on the doorstep with voters			0
it is not the first time @entity10 has been involved in rows with senior @entity6 figures			0
the @entity103 revealed in january how he and shadow chancellor @entity104 had to be ' dragged apart ' when they almost came to blows during a blazing row			0
former cabinet minister @entity107 was forced to intervene , saying she feared the pair were about to get into ' fisticuffs ' when they clashed in a private @entity112 room			0
in march , this newspaper revealed how another of @entity1 's election aides , @entity116 , told the @entity6 leader he wanted to resign , saying he could no longer work with ' bloody impossible ' @entity10			1
mr @entity116 was moved to the transport portfolio , avoiding further clashes with @entity10			2
and in april , deputy labour leader @entity120 and mr @entity104 were caught plotting against @entity10 outside @entity122 's commons office			2
ms @entity120 told @entity122 : ' the trouble with @entity10 is that he just is n't engaged at the moment			0
' @entity125 reportedly nodded in reply .			0
