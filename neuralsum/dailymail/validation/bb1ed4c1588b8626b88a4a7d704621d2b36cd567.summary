is it possible to get a group of 15 three to five - year - olds , who have never played the piano before , together on a concert stage to perform a piece of classical music in just five weeks ? @entity8 insurance company @entity7 attempted just that for a recent commercial project entitled ‘ @entity12 ’ and the results – although containing a couple of expected errors – are outstanding			1
in the clip the conductor is shown at work leading an orchestra , before entering the room full of children from a preschool in @entity21 , @entity22 and uttering : ‘ oh dear ’ at the sight of the youngsters running around			1
the conductor is featured taking the children to the piano in turn and teaching them how to play a few notes the 15 pianos , each featuring a photograph of a child , are assembled in a circle on the concert stage settling them down , he takes them one - by - one to the piano and begins the difficult task of teaching them how to play a few notes			2
teasing out a piece of the final performance , the development of the children is briefly showcased alongside the conductor stating : ‘ sometimes you do n’t know what makes the penny drop			1
’ the stage is set , the conductor gets dressed and the pianos are fitted with photographs of the children who will momentarily play them			0
climbing up onto their stools , the children are silenced by the conductor ’s baton and the performance gets under way			0
the children stop talking and wait in anticipation to begin playing after the conductor raps his baton off of a music stand concentrating , the children hunch over their pianos and each play their individual bits with their index fingers the young children begin playing @entity69 ’s @entity68 as the conductor leads them from the front each concentrating on their own individual part , the children – hunched over their pianos in anticipation – use their index fingers to press the keys and together play the beginning of @entity69 ’s @entity68			1
a few bum notes feature in the piece , but they fit wonderfully alongside the imagery of teddy bears accompanying the children at the pianos and feet swinging from stools miles from the ground			0
as the performance ends , the conductor and the children congratulate each other and the credits begin to roll			0
despite hitting a few bum notes the children , who have only played the piano for 15 weeks , perform outstandingly well the conductor and the children congratulate each other at the end of the successful performance			2

the children aged three to five had never played the piano before
conductor took just five weeks to teach them their individual parts
the children play the beginning of @entity69 ’s @entity68
despite a few mistakes the final performance is outstanding
the commercial was a project of insurance company @entity7
the children are all *attendees* of a preschool in @entity21 , @entity22
