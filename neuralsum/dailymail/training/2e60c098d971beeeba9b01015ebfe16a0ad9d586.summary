not content with luring bargain - conscious shoppers away from the bigger supermarkets with cheap groceries and deli items , @entity0 has also entered the worlds of fashion and beauty			1
four years ago , the store 's £ 4 perfume , suddenly madame @entity10 , outshone @entity13 ’s £ 61 @entity12 in a trial			1
then in 2013 , beauty experts raved about the brand ’s £ 1.99 bb cream			0
and now , the @entity19 supermarket giant wants to style us for spring as it unveils a fashion range that caters to ' savvy style hunters '			1
so , can you style a mini-break for under £ 50 ? intrigued by a bargain , @entity27 put the new range to the test on a weekend away in the countryside to ascertain whether you really can style a three - day break for £ 50			1
following the sell - out success of its autumn fashion range in august 2014 , @entity0 's new collection , which hits stores on february 26 , is inspired by @entity41			1
named see you in @entity41 , the range - which is the first of four to launch this year - is full of @entity43 tops , jeggings and soft jersey dresses that can be dressed for day or night			2
for a country walk , the £ 4.99 jeggings , £ 5.99 pumps , £ 5.99 knit jumper and £ 15 trench work well , and for £ 25.98 for the whole look , @entity26 was very impressed for an al fresco lunch come spring , the £ 6.99 nautical dress , £ 15 trench coat and £ 5.99 pumps are ideal			2
the dress was very loose - fitted , which i preferred , but some people would no doubt rather a more fitted option for lounging around the house , the £ 4.99 jeggings and £ 3.99 vests are ideal			2
the jeggings ( jean leggings ) are comfortable and come with an elasticated waistband			0
i opted for the blue vest because the white vest was slightly see - through so ensure you 're wearing a neutral bra			0
this outfit can be dressed up for lunch with the girls by pulling on a £ 5.99 @entity43 top and slipping on the practical but stylish £ 5.99 ballerina pumps			0
i often find new pumps painful and they sometimes require ' breaking in ' but these slipped on with ease			0
if lunch is a more formal affair , the £ 6.99 nautical dress teamed with the £ 14.99 trench coat works well			0
for me , the trench was the highlight of the range and while it 's no @entity88 coat , it was perfect for the warmer months and very well cut			2
likewise , the £ 5.99 navy and cream knit jumper was comfortable and could easily become one of my wardrobe staples come spring			1
i was n't keen on the £ 6.99 red dress , which was far from flattering on my size 12 frame ; teamed with the pumps , it did little to accentuate my figure for dinner , the red dress was n't quite smart enough for my liking but thanks to its jersey material and fit , it was comfortable , at least less successful was the £ 6.99 red dress , which was far from flattering on my size 12 frame			0
plus , as someone who wears heels on a daily basis , the pumps did little for my silhouette so i 'd like to see @entity0 branch out with its footwear offering			2
ultimately , it 's cheap as chips			0
the best value item is a pair of black leggings , which are £ 2.99 , and an entire outfit - including top , bottoms , coat and shoes - can be bought for under £ 30			1
speaking about the range , a @entity0 spokesperson said : ' as we see increased demand for fashion forward clothing at great value , it ’s an exciting step for us to launch our second complete women ’s fashion collection			1
' with more choice than ever before , customers can purchase a whole outfit from us without the big price tag			0
last year , items flew off the shelves within days of going on sale so we ’d advise customers to get down to stores to snap up a bargain quick			0
' the final verdict ? while i would n't rock head - to - toe @entity0 , i would most certainly mix and match budget fashion gems , such as the trench coat , with a @entity147 blouse and trousers			1
the range essentially offers useful staples at an extraordinary price , even giving @entity152 a run for its money			0
@entity0 will be adding four more drops to their clothing range - and sunglasses and statement necklaces make up the latest collection the collection can be styled from day , left , to night , right , and no look will set you back more than £ 30			1

budget chain @entity0 's spring 14 - piece range drops on 26 february
@entity27 tested the *capsule* wardrobe over a weekend in the countryside
none of the outfits cost more than £ 30
