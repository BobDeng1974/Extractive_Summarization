guests at a wedding service saw triple when three identical sisters tied the knot together at the same ceremony			1
triplets @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity8 share the same birthday , the same looks and tastes , and now - after marrying men who look strikingly similar - the same wedding anniversary too			1
the 29 - year - old sisters , from @entity15 , southern @entity16 , even wore the same wedding dress , as well as hair style and make up , for their big day on saturday			1
even the grooms - @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 - admitted they had worried they might mix up their wives - to - be when it came to exchanging vows			1
@entity24 , who married @entity5 , told how the girls sometimes deliberately confused their fiances			1
he remembered : ' there was a time when we were all in the kitchen making dinner			0
so @entity7 , who is @entity25 's , was doing stuff at the sink , and @entity5 was at the stove			1
' we were there chatting and they changed places			0
i went behind to hug her , and said " oops " when i realised i 'd got the wrong girl			0
' on the day , though , the men insisted they did n't have a problem recognising the loves of their lives			2
' oh yes , i knew which one was mine , for sure			0
i knew as soon as she entered the church , she was the most beautiful , ' said @entity26 , who married @entity8			1
the sisters told how , like other identical siblings , they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies			2
@entity68 : like many identical siblings , the sisters told how they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies together : it was parents @entity73 and @entity75 who suggested the girls all get married together after @entity8 also got engaged to @entity26 their parents , @entity73 and @entity75 , already had one daughter , @entity80 , when they decided to increase the family - but never imagined three more girls would come at once			1
mother @entity75 fainted when she was told she was expecting triplets , according to the girls			0
@entity5 was the first to find her future husband , @entity24 , ten years ago while studying at university			1
a year later , @entity7 got together with @entity25			1
it was parents @entity73 and @entity75 who suggested the girls all get married together after @entity8 also got engaged to @entity26			1
the only dilemma for @entity73 , a farmer , was how he would walk all three daughters down the aisle at once			0
he said : ' we decided that we would all walk down the aisle until half way down the church			0
from there , i would take one at a time			0
' the pews at the @entity100 catholic cathedral in @entity15 were moved apart to allow more space for the three brides to walk down the aisle together			0
they were followed by 18 bridesmaids and page boys , each using the chosen colour of the bride they were representing , yellow for @entity5 , blue for @entity7 and red for @entity8			1
the first to be taken to the altar by their father was @entity8 , who was the first to be born			2
she remembered : ' i tried to hold back my emotion , but i could n't			0
to see my dad there , at that moment , was a feeling i ca n't explain			0
' event : the pews at the @entity100 catholic cathedral in @entity15 were moved apart to allow more space for the three brides to walk down the aisle together lookalike : the girls explained how they all went together to get their hair and make - up done with the intention of looking different - but they all ended up liking the same style the girls explained how they all went together to get their hair and make - up done with the intention of looking different			1
but , said @entity7 , ' we tried a number of styles , but we all liked the same one			2
it 's not even worth trying , it always ends up like that			0
' after the ceremony , the fact that there were three bouquets to be caught was not lost on the female guests , according to the sisters			2
and for @entity26 , the fact that triplets run in their wives family has n't put the husbands off			2
he said : ' we 're going to think about starting our family			0
if we have triplets , it wo n't be easy , but they will be a blessing and we'lll raise them with love			0
