scientists have used cosmic rays from the distant universe to study lightning and thunderclouds in unprecedented detail			1
cosmic rays constantly bombard @entity8 ’s atmosphere , and there have been some suggestions they could even trigger lightning			1
but this particular experiment observed how cosmic rays were affected by lightning as they passed through it - providing information on the electrical field of a given storm			1
scientists in @entity18 were using the @entity20 radio telescope			1
they found it could measure changes in lightning caused by cosmic rays ( illustrated )			1
a storm can have hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres			1
the method could provide a novel way to understand thunderclouds the experiment was conducted using the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) radio telescope in the @entity18			1
researchers found , almost by accident , that cosmic rays were a suitable probe to measure electric fields within thunderclouds			1
high in the atmosphere , the rays strike atmospheric molecules and create ‘ showers ’ of elementary particles - the smallest known to exist			0
a long - standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high - energy particles from space that hit @entity8			0
called cosmic rays , they 're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at @entity49 's @entity48			1
they strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles , mostly muons , electrons and photons , over a wide area			0
though they were discovered decades ago , cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare , making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated			1
it 's thought that some come from supernovae , but it 's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well			2
these showers can be measured from the radio emissions that are generated when they interact with @entity8 ’s magnetic field			0
by measuring this during a thunderstorm , the researchers found they could find out information about the electric field in a thundercloud as it affected the radio emissions			2
it was found to be as strong as 50 kilovolts per one metre ( 3.3ft ) - which translates into a voltage of hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres , an enormous amount of energy			1
' we modeled how the electric field in thunderstorms can explain the different measurements , ’ said researcher dr @entity90 from @entity91 in the @entity18			2
‘ this worked very well			0
how the radio emission changes gives us a lot of information about the electric fields in thunderstorms			0
‘ we could even determine the strength of the electric field at a certain height in the cloud			0

this new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity			2
current measurement methods from planes , balloons or little rockets are dangerous and too localised			0
most importantly , the presence of the measurement equipment influences the measurements too			0
cosmic rays probe the thunderclouds from top to bottom			1
moving at almost the speed of light they provide a near instantaneous ' picture ' of the electric fields in the cloud			0
moreover , they are created by nature and are freely available			0
' this research is an exemplary form of interdisciplinary collaboration between astronomers , particle physicists and geophysicists ' , said dr @entity147 , also from @entity91			0
' we hope to develop the model further to ultimately answer the question : how is lightning initiated within thunderclouds ? ' @entity111 ( shown in @entity152 ) is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims victims around the world			0
