@entity0 will want his side to perform well at the @entity2 on wednesday night - but maybe not that well			1
the high - flying @entity3 face an @entity5 side who have been struggling to maintain their top - four credentials so far this term			1
the @entity9 have spent very little time in the @entity11 positions but victory will certainly go some way to achieving that , against a team which has produced a number of their top talent in recent years @entity5 's young talent including @entity19 and @entity20 in training at @entity22 @entity23 celebrates scoring for @entity3 , who are flying high in third place in the @entity26 @entity27 moved to @entity5 from @entity3 for £ 9million in january 2006 @entity28 has signed three players from @entity3 for a combined £ 35million			1
they are : @entity27 - signed for £ 9m in january 2006 @entity30 - signed for £ 12m in august 2011 @entity20 - signed for £ 12m in july 2014 @entity28 was also interested in signing these three players from the @entity3 : @entity32 - moved to @entity33 for £ 7m in may 2007 ( before leaving for @entity34 in a world - record £ 86m deal in september 2013 ) @entity37 - moved to @entity38 for £ 31m in june 2014 @entity39 - still at @entity40 's @entity5 's talent spotters have traditionally found @entity40 's a happy hunting ground			1
@entity27 , @entity30 and @entity20 have all arrived in north @entity22 from the south coast in recent years			1
there could have been more : @entity32 , @entity37 and @entity39 have been on @entity28 's radar at one time or another			1
speaking in 2012 , @entity5 manager @entity28 said : ' the question of @entity3 's academy set - up is a very good one because they have done a fabulous job			1
' why ? it is down to the quality of their scouting , the quality of their coaching and education			0
when you look at what @entity32 is doing , and @entity27			2
' and now they have they players like @entity39 , they have brought some players of top , top quality and they work well			0
' glowing praise , indeed			0
no wonder @entity5 have kept such a close eye on @entity3 's talent pool			1
having already won at the @entity2 this season , albeit in the @entity75 , victory on wednesday will confirm @entity0 side as bona - fide @entity11 contenders			1
and while @entity5 have never been out of touch with the top four , they are yet to stake a firm claim in the elite pack so far this season			0
wednesday night is a big test for both clubs in north @entity22			2
@entity30 swapped @entity40 's for the @entity2 when he moved for £ 12m in august 2011 @entity20 also moved from the @entity3 to @entity5 for a £ 12million sum last summer let 's face it , we all expect the wheels to come off at some point between now and the end of the season for @entity3			1
the @entity3 were heavily tipped to struggle this season following the much - publicised summer exodus of their top players			2
@entity99 was even mentioned in some circles , a thought those who made such assumptions would never admit			0
but the quality of their scouting system has shone through once more			0
@entity5 also tried to sign @entity37 ( left ) , who moved to @entity38 for £ 30million last summer and @entity39 , who remains at @entity104 and has excelled so far this season @entity28 was tracking @entity32 while he was at @entity3 but he is now at @entity34 and what if @entity5 come knocking again ? there 's plenty on offer at @entity40 's			1
@entity109 arrived as @entity111 's replacement and was hardly a household name on these shores			0
however , speak to some of @entity109 's @entity3 team - mates today and they 'll tell you the @entity117 is an upgrade on @entity111			1
nine goals since his arrival in @entity122 tells its own story			0
@entity124 was signed as @entity126 's replacement			0
again , not a name many @entity26 followers would know much about			0
@entity129 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring a vital goal for @entity5 against @entity132 @entity133 guides @entity19 during the victory over the @entity132 at the weekend @entity0 has impressed as manager so far and will look to continue his good work against @entity5 @entity109 has been an excellent signing for @entity3 so far this season , scoring nine times they definitely do now , though ; the @entity142 's pace , skill and intelligence down @entity3 's left has been a key feature of @entity0 's attacking blueprint			1
@entity148 replaced @entity37 at left back and @entity3 fans have hardly noticed the £ 31m man 's departure			1
even the decision to allow @entity153 to leave for @entity5 was part of a grand plan : to allow @entity23 to fully establish himself as the club 's first - choice right back			2
@entity124 ( right ) has added pace , skill and intelligence to @entity3 's left - hand side he 's not only accomplished that task , but he is now , arguably , @entity122 's first - choice right back			2
and following an astonishing run of 11 wins in 12 games , @entity3 found themselves in the top four last month			0
those who doubted how they 'd cope without @entity126 , @entity37 , @entity111 and @entity153 were eating their words			0
but two games without a win has once again cast doubt on @entity3			0
so while the south coast pretenders occupy a seat at the top table they must fear they 'll lose more talent to the likes of @entity5 if they maintain their remarkable start to the season			2
@entity177 here to like our @entity179 page			0
@entity181 has replaced @entity37 and looks extremely strong at left back for the @entity3			2

@entity5 host @entity3 at the @entity2 on wednesday night
saints are third in @entity26 - six points ahead of @entity9
@entity27 , @entity30 and @entity20 have all been signed by @entity28 from @entity3 in the past
they also tried to sign @entity32 , @entity37 and @entity39
if @entity0 's men win at @entity5 they 'll confirm top - four credentials
