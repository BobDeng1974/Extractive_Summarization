by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 @entity3 will attack president @entity4 for his ' naive ' intention to meet president @entity6 of @entity7 and warn @entity8 that the president will hold talks with @entity8 adversaries if he is re-elected , according to a senior @entity3 aide			1
in july 2007 , @entity4 answered a debate question about whether he would meet ' without precondition ' in the first year of his administration ' the leaders of @entity7 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 '			1
@entity4 responded : ' i would			0
' he did not renounce this during the rest of the 2008 campaign			0
no such talks have ever happened but a weekend report in the ' @entity28 ' - denied by the @entity29 - that the @entity8 has held secret talks with @entity7 as a prelude to formal negotiations after the election makes @entity4 freshly vulnerable on the topic , the @entity3 campaign believes			1
scroll down to watch the ad on the attack : the ad attempts to laud @entity4 's military achievements during the last four years warmonger ? @entity4 claims that @entity3 would have left @entity8 troops in @entity41 - but fails to mention the president himself tried to keep 10,000 there at the time , @entity45 , now @entity4 's secretary of state , described @entity4 's response as ' irresponsible and frankly naive ' and that such meetings could be used ' for propaganda purposes '			1
senator @entity49 , the @entity50 nominee in 2008 , said that it betrayed ' the depth of senator @entity4 's inexperience and reckless judgement '			0
the senior aide said that @entity3 plans to use the third and final televised debate , in @entity1 , @entity2 , to highlight @entity4 's willingness to meet the world 's worst dictators and the dangers of handing a ' blank check ' to @entity4 in the form of a second term			1
@entity3 has been more adamant than @entity4 on the need to stop @entity7 getting a nuclear weapon ' capability ' as opposed to actual nuclear weapons - something prime minister @entity68 of @entity69 has also emphasised			1
@entity70 has noted that the @entity3 campaign recently toughened the @entity7 language on its website and added a new section slamming @entity4 ' for his willingness to talk without preconditions or pressure '			2
the @entity29 has said it was prepared to meet @entity7 for one - on - one talks but denied the report that post-election negotiations had already been agreed			2
meanwhile , the @entity4 campaign today released an attack ad painting @entity3 as a warmonger just hours before the pair clash on foreign policy in the debate			1
@entity4 previewed his attacks on @entity3 at their clash in @entity1 , @entity2 with an ad that portrays him as an anti-war figure , massaging the facts about his movement of troops in and out of @entity41 and @entity95			1
the big stage : @entity98 students serve as stand - ins during final preparations for the debate practice run : stand - ins for @entity8 president @entity4 , right , and @entity3 , left , and moderator @entity105 , center , participate in a rehearsal a day ahead of the final presidential debate at @entity98 ready for action : president @entity4 boards @entity110 at @entity111 today on his way to @entity1 ' a decade of war that cost us dearly			1
and now for president , a clear choice : president @entity4 ended the @entity120 , ' the ad says			0
' @entity3 would have left 30,000 troops there and called bringing them home ' tragic '			1
@entity4 's brought 30,000 soldiers back from @entity95 and has a responsible plan to end the war			1
@entity3 calls it @entity4 's biggest mistake			2
it 's time to stop fighting over there and start rebuilding here ' in fact , @entity4 tried to negotiate with the @entity41 government for 10,000 troops to stay in the country			1
it was only because talks collapsed that all troops were withdrawn - under an agreement brokered by president @entity139			0
@entity4 has brought back 30,000 troops from @entity95 but these were the 30,000 ' surge ' troops he ordered there in december 2009			1
current troops levels are about 68,000 - more than twice when @entity4 entered the @entity29			2
@entity3 currently leads by a wafer - thin 0.3 per cent nationally in the @entity145 poll of averages			0
@entity4 is down seven in the @entity148 tracking poll , down two in the @entity150 poll and has seen his leads in @entity2 and @entity152 disappear and his @entity154 advantage whittled down to almost nothing.the latest @entity157 / @entity156 poll , which had @entity4 three points ahead before the debates , now puts the two candidates dead level on 47 points each among likely voters with six per cent undecided			2
celebration : students at @entity98 held a pool party before the debate to mark the historic occasion stunt double : @entity98 student @entity170 , a stand - in for president @entity4 , walks off stage during final preparations for monday 's presidential debate although most pundits and post-debate polls have @entity4 the advantage over @entity3 following the second debate , he has seen no improvement in the polls and the momentum appears to remain with the @entity50 nominee			1
the final presidential debate will focus on foreign policy - a traditional @entity50 strength that should be an advantage for @entity4 this time around because of the demise of @entity188 last may and the end of the @entity41 war			1
indeed , @entity4 has served notice that he will play the @entity188 card to full advantage , saying in his speech at the @entity196 dinner in @entity197 last week : ' spoiler alert : we got @entity188			2
' at the vice-presidential debate in @entity202 , @entity203 , it took vice president @entity204 one minute and seven seconds into the first answer of the debate - to a question about @entity208 - to bring up @entity188			0
@entity208 , however , presents @entity4 with some problems			0
although @entity3 got tangled up in the weeds of whether @entity4 had referred to the @entity218 attack as a ' terrorist act , ' during their last bout , the death of the first @entity8 ambassador to be murdered in the line of duty since 1979 and the intelligence and security failures that led to it make the president very vulnerable			2
in addition , it has become clear that the @entity29 ’s initial insistence that the attack was a result of protests about an anti-islam video made in @entity229 were flat wrong - and possibly part of an official cover - up			0

before the two candidates first debated on october 3rd , @entity4 held a 15 - point lead over @entity3 on the question of who was more capable of dealing with foreign affairs			2
after @entity4 ’s lackluster performance , a @entity279 poll found that the gap had closed to just four points			0

@entity3 paused his preparations to attend church with his wife sunday morning and to watch his traveling press corps play touch football against his senior staff			0
@entity350 - eyed : @entity3 and @entity351 were in @entity2 over the weekend , attending church on sunday and preparing for the third and final debate on monday drawing a crowd : president @entity4 is pictured speaking to supporters at a campaign rally in @entity358 , @entity152 on friday the former @entity360 governor presided over a coin toss on the beach , then gathered his aides to cheer them on			1
' that 's right , do n't worry about injuries guys , this counts			0
win , ' he joked			0
@entity3 did n't talk politics , refusing to answer a question about whether , if elected , he would be open to direct talks with @entity7			0
questions from reporters about the new poll and monday 's debate likewise went unanswered			0

master of ceremonies : @entity3 , who was at the beach separately from his wife , organized a game of flag football between the pool reporters who cover his campaign and his staffers strategy : the group let loose sunday afternoon on @entity391			0
