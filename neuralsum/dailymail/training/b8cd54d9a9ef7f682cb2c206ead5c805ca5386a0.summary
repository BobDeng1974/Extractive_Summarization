by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 22:13 est , 11 april 2012 early release : @entity1 served just 18 weeks in jail a fly - tipper who illegally dumped more than a million used tyres – earning £ 2.5million in the process – has been told by a court to pay back just £ 122			1
the derisory sum was said to be the only ‘ available asset ’ left in a bank account linked to @entity12 ’s now defunct company , @entity11 ( @entity13 )			1
@entity12 , 34 , had left a ‘ trail of destruction ’ on the countryside by renting land and blighting it by storing hundreds of thousands of tyres without permission			1
he made his fortune through undercutting business rivals who would have had to pay a charge of 80p per tyre to use official waste sites			1
when the 34 - year - old was caught and jailed for 15 months in november , environmental campaigners celebrated			1
but their joy was short - lived when last month the businessman – dubbed the @entity30 – was released less than a third of the way into his sentence			1
now they have been further angered by the proceeds - of - crime hearing			2
@entity12 was even given six months to pay the £ 122 by @entity37			1
he refused to comment when he left the hearing , but a friend said afterwards : ‘ he ’s happy and relieved			2
it is a bit of a result but he ’s served his time and has n’t got any money to give them			2
what else do they want ? ’ landscape blighted : @entity12 dumped more than a million tyres victims , however , were shocked by what they saw as soft justice			1
@entity53 , a member of @entity54 , which retrieved fly - tipped tyres from the @entity56 in @entity57 , criticised the ruling			2
‘ it ’s absolutely ridiculous they can only get such a small amount of money back			2
‘ they need to investigate it further to find out where all the money has gone			0
dumping tyres , whether it ’s in a river or on land , causes major pollution			0
’ @entity12 lives in a four - bedroom farmhouse on a sprawling rural site in @entity74 , @entity75 , where his parents also reside			1
he is understood to drive a white van			0
between october 2009 and january 2010 he hired land in five counties – @entity57 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity75 – and used the spots to store the tyres			0
one site at @entity86 , @entity81 , where more than 125,000 were left , drains into a tributary of the @entity88 , which is a source of drinking water			0
despite warnings from the @entity92 on 20 occasions , @entity12 failed to register the operation			1
when legal action began against him he simply rented new sites			0
@entity92 officials found 3,000 tyres at the @entity75 site and said the number grew to 400,000 as their investigations continued			0
four other sites , with a further 800,000 tyres , were found later			0
landowners have been left a bill of £ 260,000 to clear the mess			0
@entity12 admitted six charges relating to the illegal storage and treatment of waste and was jailed at @entity111 on november 7			1
his business had a turnover of £ 2,540,768			0
the judge at @entity111 could only order @entity12 to hand over £ 122 judge @entity115 said at the time : ‘ you have left a trail of destruction for other people to pick up			1
i am quite satisfied that your motive was the long - term prospect of making big money			0
’ @entity12 was set free on march 15 on licence under the early release programme			1
the @entity92 refused to speculate yesterday as to whether @entity12 had moved his proceeds abroad			2
but it insisted it had a confiscation order for £ 2.5million , which would apply to any future money he came into			0
a spokesman said : ‘ having proven his guilt , we took him to court again to take away his illegal profits			0
the £ 2.5million confiscation order can be revisited in the future			0

@entity12 released after serving just a third of his 15 month jail sentence
given six months to pay tiny fine , despite *amassing* huge fortune
