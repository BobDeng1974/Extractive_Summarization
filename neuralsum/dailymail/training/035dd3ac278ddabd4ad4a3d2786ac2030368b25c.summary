by @entity0 published : 07:14 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 20:48 est , 25 october 2012 you might think the photograph shows a burglar caught in the act			2
or perhaps a gentleman caller trying to evade his lover ’s husband			0
in fact , it ’s a snap of @entity12 ’s least safety - conscious window - cleaner			0
with no harness or scaffolding to stop him falling on to the busy streets below , he does n’t seem to hold much truck with the health and safety brigade			0
scroll down to watch shocking : a bystander captures the man on camera as he can be seen clambering out of a third floor window and onto the ledge of the building in @entity26 , @entity27 , without a safety harness ( top right ) the daredevil rarely looked down as he nonchalantly carried out his task – seemingly indifferent to the danger			1
the workman , whose identity remains a mystery , was spotted by a passer - by who filmed him climbing on to the third - floor ledge of the building in @entity26 , @entity27			1
with the poise of a home - grown @entity39 , he edged himself around stone balustrades , and along precipitous ledges to reach the glass			0
he then made his way to the level below , this time walking along the top of the narrow windows			2
the bizarre scene outside the building – which houses the £ 85 - a - night @entity51 hotel and a @entity53 restaurant on the ground floor – has been posted on @entity55			1
risky : the footage showed him balancing precariously on a ledge without a safety harness as he climbed across the building - 40ft up - in order to clean its windows precarious : the man crept along the face of the four - storey building in order to clean other windows - as bystanders watched in horror the flabbergasted witness wrote : ‘ i could n’t believe my eyes when i spotted this guy			1
i ’m no great advocate of the @entity74 brigade , but ... ’ staff at the building ’s ground - floor restaurant said the incident was being dealt with by the chain ’s owners @entity81			1
they have been in contact with the health and safety team at @entity85			0
a spokesman for @entity87 said : ‘ we take health and safety extremely seriously and fully expect the same from external contractors			0
therefore we were shocked by the footage			2
‘ when the video was brought to our attention we immediately moved to prevent this from happening again and have launched a full investigation into how this could have happened at all			0
' @entity98 cleaning ... danger : he carries on risking his life by clambering around the outside of the building - using his hands and feet to cling on in the style of a rock climber worrying : the man teeters on the edge of a ledge on the corner of the building , which houses a @entity53 restaurant			1

man risks life by climbing around outside of the building to clean windows
