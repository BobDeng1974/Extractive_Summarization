author ] published : 09:39 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 10:14 est , 6 june 2013 these literature - loving ladies are taking a leaf out of the men 's book - by sunbathing topless in parks and public spaces			2
a group of friends decided to form a topless book club so women can enjoy relaxing and tanning in public , just like men			1
using @entity15 law , which says women can go bare chested anywhere men can , the social group formed so women could meet and safely sunbathe together			1
the women said they take the literature part of the book club very seriously @entity23 members said they have received overwhelmingly positive reaction from other women the women , who withheld their names to protect themselves online , take photographs of themselves sunbathing around @entity15 in just shorts and bikini bottoms			1
among the locations favoured by the book club are @entity33 , hotel rooftops , riverside walkways and even the steps of the @entity37			1
one of the group 's founders said the response to their meetings , which are always formed of six or more women , has been overwhelmingly positive			2
she said : ' for every woman who glares when we pass and mutters : " there are children around " , there are a dozen who come over and thank us for what we 're doing			0
' the best was an elderly woman who came over with her miniature poodle earlier this summer and spent an hour sitting with us			0
' she was just so delighted			0
it felt wonderful to make her day			0
' the group ( pictured in @entity33 ) said if a man can show his chest then a woman should be allowed to the group meet outside the @entity37 ( right ) and @entity33 and in roof gardens ( left ) the founders knew the law allowed a woman to be topless anywhere a man could be , but had never seen it in practice			1
hesitant to test the law as individuals , the women found the confidence to remove their bikini tops in the company of friends			0
the founder said : ' there 's no rational reason a woman 's breasts should be forbidden if a man 's chest is not			1
' the more we show people that seeing a woman 's nipples wo n't cause the sky to fall , the more freedom and equality women will enjoy			1
' as well as making a feminist statement , the group takes the literary aspect of the book club quite seriously			1
the founder said : ' that probably makes it pretty boring for someone who is n't interesting in the books and discussions			0
' people 's significant others sometimes wonder if there 's something sexual about the group			2
they say they want people to realise there is nothing shocking about a woman 's breasts ' but when they come , they discover it 's just a batch of friends sitting around in the sun , reading and discussing books , laughing and eating cupcakes			1
' although the book club occasionally receive inappropriate stares , it has not deterred them having fun			2
the founder said : ' i think we get fewer catcalls and less harassment when we 're out topless in a group than when any one of us is just walking down the street fully clothed			0
' we 've been approached by the police a couple of times , but every time the police have confirmed that what we 're doing is completely legal and they 've been very polite about it			0
' as well as having fun and enjoying reading in the sun , the club hopes to inspire other women			0
the founder said : ' our hope would be that we set an example for other women , and that a few years from now a woman going bare - chested in the park or even on the street would attract no more attention than a bare - chested man			0
