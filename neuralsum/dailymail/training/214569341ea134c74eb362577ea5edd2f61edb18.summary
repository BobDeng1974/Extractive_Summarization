by @entity0 warning : @entity2 governor @entity1 said that the @entity3 must build new houses to avoid boom and bust the governor of the @entity2 has issued a stark warning that the booming housing market is now the biggest single threat to the economy – and said that the country must build more houses if it wants to avoid further catastrophic boom - and - bust cycles			1
@entity1 said not enough homes were being constructed to meet demand , and that there were signs that an increasing number of buyers were beginning to borrow heavily again			1
his warning comes as house prices soar in some parts of @entity3 – although in other areas they remain stagnant			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ the biggest risk to financial stability , and therefore to the durability of the expansion – those risks centre in the housing market , and that ’s why we are focused on that			1
’ contrasting @entity3 with his native @entity34 , he added : ‘ the issues around the housing market in the @entity3 … [ are ] that there are not sufficient houses built in the @entity3			1
‘ [ there are ] half as many people in @entity34 as in the @entity3 , [ but ] twice as many houses are built in @entity34 every year than in the @entity3			2
’ official figures show 112,000 homes were constructed in @entity44 in the 12 months to march and that the number of new properties being started is rising			2
but the figure is still far below the 177,000 houses built in 2007			0
mr @entity1 – who issued the warning in an interview with @entity52 ’s @entity51 , to be broadcast today – also revealed there was a risk that home buyers are borrowing heavily once again , with signs that loans of four times a person ’s salary or more were starting to increase			1
‘ we do n’t want to build up another big debt overhang that is going to hurt individuals and is very much going to slow the economy in the medium term , ’ he said			2
‘ we would be concerned if there were rapid increases in high loan - to - value mortgages across the banks ... we ’ve seen that creeping up and it ’s something that we are watching closely			0
’ the @entity2 has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent , despite pleas from some economists that action is needed to calm the bubble emerging in some regions			0
bubble : economists have urged the @entity2 to raise interest rates to calm the market last week , mr @entity1 said the @entity2 judged the economy was still fragile and indicated rate rises were unlikely in the near future			1
when they came they would be ‘ limited ’ : ‘ the recovery is neither balanced nor sustainable , ’ he said			0
the @entity2 is widely expected to use tools other than an interest - rate rise to stem excessive borrowing			0
under new powers granted to it as part of an overhaul of financial regulation , it could require banks to set aside more capital reserves against home loans or tighten rules on lending			0
the @entity101 , which is chaired by the governor and is in charge of the stability of the financial system , is expected to outline how it might use those powers next month .			0

governor @entity1 said @entity3 must build more homes to meet demand
otherwise the property market will lead to more boom - and - bust cycles
mr @entity1 also warned that buyers were begin to borrow heavily again
