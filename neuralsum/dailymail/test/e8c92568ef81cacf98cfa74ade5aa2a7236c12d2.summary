8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer @entity3 was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal			1
@entity3 , then 68 , had the scan as part of the @entity9 breast cancer screening programme , and as she says : ' as always , getting the all - clear was a big relief			1
' but 18 months later , shortly before her 70th birthday , the mother - of - three from @entity14 developed intermittent pain in her left side , just below her breast			1
and although @entity3 , a former administrator , was n't concerned , her daughter , a radiographer , insisted she see a gp			1
despite finding nothing abnormal , the @entity19 referred @entity3 for a mammogram			1
this revealed three lumps on her left breast , which were all tumours			1
@entity3 is adamant : ' that gp appointment saved my life			1
' breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988 , with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years			1
in 2000 , the upper limit was extended to 70			2
' i did n't realise it at the time , but at 68 i 'd already had my last official mammogram , ' says @entity3			1
' it 's all the more scary knowing that , because even though i check my breasts regularly , i definitely had n't felt any lumps			0
without my daughter , i would n't have gone to my gp			0
' @entity3 was one of the lucky ones			1
@entity39 are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit			1
in a report published two weeks ago , the @entity43 on @entity44 pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer			2
and while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70			1
so , extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved , the @entity39 said			1
in fact , the upper age limit is due to change			1
from the end of 2016 , all women up to 73 will be invited for screening			1
but critics argue this is not high enough			0
@entity65 , a researcher at the @entity66 , says this cut - off point ' seems arbitrary ' , adding : ' it feels like a decision based on cost rather than what 's best for women			2
' and the parliamentary group is concerned at the ' slow pace of change '			0
in 2013 , they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76 , and possibly to 79			1
' extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved ' ' while some progress has been made , there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care , treatment and support most appropriate to them , ' says @entity91 , the @entity92 mp for @entity93 and co-chair of the parliamentary group			1
and this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms			2
there 's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women			2
in 2013 , researchers at the @entity104 said women over 70 in the @entity106 who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one - in - seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients			2
a study from the @entity112 , published in the @entity113 , reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in @entity117 , where screening in most of the country continues to 74			1
@entity120 , national clinical director for cancer at @entity123 , last year warned : ' around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in @entity123 if survival rates matched the best in @entity127			2
' it is ‘ shameful ’ to write off people as too old for screening and treatment , adds @entity132 , chief executive of @entity133			2
‘ people should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age			2
’ ending screening at 73 ‘ does n’t take account of the fact that ageing is changing ’ , adds @entity65			0
‘ it ’s no longer a strong indicator of frailty			0
just look at the role models for women in their 70s			0
’ yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear - cut , for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment			1
a @entity154 study , published in the @entity155 in august 2014 , suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in ' over- diagnosis and overtreatment '			1
researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995 , when breast cancer screening in the @entity154 was extended from 69 to 75			1
they found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer , while the number of early - stage tumours detected increased considerably			0
for every woman found to have advanced cancer , another 20 would be diagnosed with small , slow - growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			0
lead researcher dr @entity179 , of @entity180 , said : ' the chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women			0
' older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer , he pointed out			0
' so it may take them a year , a year and a half before they function normally			0
' for @entity3 , however , there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended			1
after her second mammogram in march 2011 , she had a needle biopsy the same day , and two weeks later a mastectomy			0
the cancer had spread to her neck , so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five - week course of radiotherapy			0
' the treatment was murderous , ' says @entity3			1
but as she prepares to receive the all - clear next year , she has no regrets about having this treatment			0
indeed , her worry is that , once five years since her treatment have passed , she 'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be			0
in fact , women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it 's just the invitations that stop			1
cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer			2
women are entitled to request mammograms at any age an added complication is that older women are likely to be less ' breast aware ' and more cautious about bothering their gp , the @entity43 pointed out previously			1
@entity228 , clinical nurse specialist at @entity229 , says : ' it 's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they are n't being invited , they are no longer at risk			0
' @entity235 , 57 , a local government officer from @entity236 , @entity237 , agrees this can be a problem			0
her mother , @entity240 , celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago			0
@entity240 had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms , despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so			2
during november 2011 , @entity235 was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram			0
the diagnosis reminded @entity240 to request another scan for herself , and in june 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy			0
rather than simply ending screening , the @entity154 researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good , say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman			1
this should be ' based on remaining life expectancy , breast cancer risk , functional status and patients ' preferences ' , says dr @entity179			0
another way forward , says @entity228 , is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones			2
' they should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening			0
but it does n't always happen			0
' @entity3 was given no such card			2
' it 's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up , ' she says			0
