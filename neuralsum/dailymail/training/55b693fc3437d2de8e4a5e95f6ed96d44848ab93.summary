@entity1 's new striker @entity0 has revealed how @entity3 team - mate @entity2 influenced his move to the @entity5			1
and @entity0 hopes his loan switch from @entity7 ends up with him celebrating a special moment against the ' @entity9 ' on saturday when @entity11 's @entity10 visit the @entity12			1
@entity0 has won 14 caps for @entity3 but his club career has never really got off the ground in @entity16 and the last two seasons has seen him loaned out to @entity18 in @entity19 and @entity20 in @entity21			2
@entity3 international @entity0 wants to get one over on his compatriot @entity11 on saturday @entity23 's @entity2 advised @entity0 to move to the @entity5 but @entity0 admits @entity23 superstar @entity2 told him the @entity5 was the place to be because the intensity of the competition was so high			1
' i spoke to @entity2 and asked him whether i would find it easier to play in the @entity29 or in @entity19 , ' @entity0 said			1
' he told me he loved playing in @entity30 with @entity31			2
' he thinks that in @entity30 it is more intense with the fans playing a big role , whereas in @entity19 it is easier to play because the intensity is not so high and the pressure is lower			0
' @entity2 is an example to many players in @entity3 because of what he has achieved and the @entity5 is something any young boy aspires to play in			0
' @entity0 made his @entity1 debut as a substitute in last weekend 's 1 - 1 home draw with @entity46 and showed some nice touches as @entity49 's men went in search of a winner			1
the 23 - year - old might again have to settle for a place on the bench against league leaders @entity10 with @entity56 leading the line in the wake of @entity60 's departure to @entity61			1
but he admits that it would be a memorable occasion coming up against his @entity65 compatriot @entity11 and former @entity7 team - mates @entity67 and @entity68			1
@entity0 ( right ) made his @entity1 debut in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity46 last weekend ' every team wants to beat @entity10 and that would be a great moment , not only for the fans and the club but for myself , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity11 is admired by everyone in @entity65 and only this week he was considered by @entity65 people as the best manager of the last 100 years			2
' he does a great job everywhere he goes and has opened a lot of doors for @entity65 managers as well as being an inspiration to everyone			0
' i watch the @entity10 games and i 've played with @entity67 at @entity7 and against @entity85 in the under - 20s @entity86			0
' @entity67 is a big player for them and i ca n't see any weaknesses , his technical ability on the ball is very good and is he is both intelligent and a hard worker			0
' @entity0 's star was on the rise when he scored in @entity3 's 2011 under - 20 @entity86 final defeat to @entity96 and was named the second - best player in that tournament in @entity99			2
@entity0 said that @entity10 boss @entity11 is ' admired by everyone ' in @entity3 less than a year later he was playing for his country at @entity102 and he was soon being linked with a Â£ 24million move to @entity31 , but he had to leave @entity7 to get regular first - team football			1
' yes , i knew something through my agent , ' @entity0 said of @entity31 's reported interest in 2012			2
' but i leave that to him and things should happen when they are right			0
' it happened before so perhaps now is the right time to come to the @entity5 and succeed			0
' i have settled very well at @entity1 and love it here			0
' the club have been great to me and if things go well i would love to stay			0
' nothing has changed in my head , i 've come here to work hard and succeed - but maybe now @entity60 has left i will have a better chance			0

@entity0 could ease @entity1 's striker woes after @entity60 exit
the @entity65 man was advised by @entity2 to move to @entity30
@entity0 wants to lead @entity1 to *victory* over @entity10 and @entity11
