today the site earmarked for the funfair at @entity12 in @entity13 appeared barren and undeveloped			1
the event was cancelled yesterday , just two days before it was due to open people driving up to the site where @entity21 was due to be held , were greeted with closed gates today the announcement has left hundreds of families and children disappointed , despite organisers saying on their @entity28 page , which had more than 3,500 likes , that the event was still due to go ahead as late as yesterday morning			1
former i ’m a celebrity star and singer @entity33 and wife @entity34 were earmarked for the ' star - studded ' opening performance			2

' after a day of discusions between the event organisers and the land owners unfortunatlly the event has had to be cancelled			1

the organisers posted this message on their @entity28 page informing people that the event had been cancelled , which prompted an angry response from some parents ' thank you all for your support and we hope to be able to do a different event at sometime in the future			1
' thanks again for your support and once again we are truely sorry but it is out of our control			0
' ( sic ) but many parents have been left feeling the entire event was a ‘ scam ’ because of its late cancellation , and the failure to begin any construction on the north west @entity5 field			1

why else would it be cancelled two days before ? the festive funfair was due to have its opening in wednesday but it was cancelled just two days before it was due to begin today , the site in @entity13 remained barren and undeveloped despite it due to be featuring fairground rides , a stalls and a @entity98 's grotto ' luckily i did n’t tell my child about this			1
' and one poster , @entity101 says she is now planning her own event to help disappointed locals			0
she said : ' sorry but if their spelling is anything to go by no wonder it was n’t taken seriously ! ' sad state of affairs to build up people ’s hopes			0
name and shame the land owners and event organisers ! ' @entity116 sounds a better idea with old fairground rides			2
“ if anyone wants help organising it let me know			0
' the attraction was supposed to run until december 27 at the a site on the @entity126 border with @entity13 , and was to feature fairground rides , a @entity98 ’s grotto and food stalls			1
the cancellation of the event comes after another winter wonderland created by tv interior designer @entity133 was forced to close after just one day due to complaints			2
the @entity135 in @entity136 created by @entity137 closed after just one day following complaints by parents about long queues , rude staff and cheap toys at the attraction the fair eventually re-opened three days later but parents were left equally unimpressed with the decorations on the site parents said the @entity135 at the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity136 , has ruined the build up to @entity150 for their children , as they attacked the ' tacky ' attraction which costs up to £ 22.50 for a ticket			2
but many complained about rude staff , large queues for their children to visit @entity150 and said cheap unwrapped presents , some squashed or broken , were being handed out to their children			0
others bemoaned of a lack of festive decorations and @entity150 music , despite paying more than £ 20 a ticket for their children			0
however , the attraction reopened to the public three days later after improvements including more fake snow			0
but parents were left equally unimpressed at the second grand opening due to over-loaded sockets being visible in the main entrance and a pile of tatty - looking presents being layed clumsily dumped in the corner of a marquee with a red @entity98 's outfit left on top .			2
