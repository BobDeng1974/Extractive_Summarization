by @entity0 @entity1 is no stranger to pushing the boundaries			1
he sparked controversy with his last couture show after he sent out @entity6 lookalikes in clothing similar to those the late singer used to wear just months after her death			1
and with today 's show , the @entity11 couturier proved that aged 60 , he still knows how to push buttons			2
@entity1 chose as his muse the former drug addicted musician , @entity15			1
the fashion designer encountered @entity15 during his stint as a @entity20 jury member this year			1
@entity15 made his acting debut as a 19th - century figure in a film that was screened at the @entity25 event			2
the movie , ' @entity26 , ' bowled @entity1 over			1
' i said my god he is so seductive , a decadent dandy , ' said the designer backstage			2
' and that 's my collection			0
' so it was that this show , with its unlikely matinee idol as a muse , became a dandyesque tribute to the silver screen			2
androgynous ' femi - man ' model @entity39 was the star turn of @entity1 's androgynous couture show this afternoon the result was a theatrical delight			1
androgynous by design and by the virtue of the show 's star turn , the so - called ' femi - man ' model @entity39 , who strode onto the catwalk wearing a gauzy black top that revealed his chest , it was pure @entity1			1
@entity56 century top hats accompanied high taffeta collars , deconstructed texture - rich satin crepe waistcoats and a sea of black			0
the black was broken up with explosions colour and bright fox fur , which provoked whoops of delight from the crowd			0
@entity1 threw in other cinema references for good measure			2
' the original idea i thought of doing @entity72 's @entity71 , ' he said , and indeed , as if straight out of that 1927 science - fiction film , there was a grey metallic looking cape with golden lining			0
he had clearly done his cinema homework			0
the shoulderless jumpsuit which completed the ensemble had the broken sheen of scrubbed metal , like the film 's robot @entity85			0
art deco prints and the odd robotic conical bra only added to the graphic feel			0
the piece de resistance came in the form of a science - fiction corset cage , that stood out from the model 's body like a mechanised hourglass			0
' i 'm here because it 's lively and provocative , ' said movie star @entity97 from the front row			0
theatrical : the opulent fabrics and striking shapes evoked scenes from the silver screen flamboyant : androgynous suits , top hats and metallic tones were a running theme in the collection @entity110 : musician @entity15 , who @entity1 encountered when he saw a film he was starring in during @entity20 , inspired @entity11 designer @entity1 takes a bow at the end of the show			1

the 60 - year - old designer said he was ' bowled over ' by the @entity119 musician after meeting him in @entity20
resulting show was a theatrical , androgynous feast for the eyes
@entity1 sparked controversy with his last show after *sending* out @entity6 lookalikes soon after her death
