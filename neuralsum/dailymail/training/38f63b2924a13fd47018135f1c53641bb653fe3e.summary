by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 19:41 est , 30 april 2013 record numbers of headteachers and other school leaders are earning six - figure salaries , official statistics reveal			1
about 800 state school heads , deputies and assistant heads were paid at least £ 100,000 last year , up from 700 in 2011			1
a quarter of them received more than £ 110,000			0
a hundred were employed by primary schools , with 700 secondary school leaders in the same pay bracket			1
it means more than a fifth of heads at senior schools earn £ 100,000 or more			1
around 800 school leaders earned more than £ 100,000 , new government figures reveal ( file picture ) experts fear the proportion of school funds they are taking up will soar further as the government encourages more academies to open			1
these schools – which are centrally funded but independent of local authorities , allowing them to set their own pay levels – were responsible for 400 of the top - paid heads			1
the other 300 worked at state secondaries			0
there were just 345 academies in november 2010 , but this number has risen to more than 2,800			2
academy heads receive an average of £ 61,900 – £ 1,000 more than colleagues at local authority - run schools			1
the bumper pay packets mean top school leaders typically earn double the average headteacher ’s salary , which was £ 55,700 last year			1
the figures , released by the @entity44 , show the government has failed to crack down on runaway pay increases at a time of austerity			0
education secretary @entity49 said in 2010 that heads should not earn more than the prime minister			1
days later it emerged an inner - city primary school headteacher was earning £ 231,400 plus a £ 45,123 pension contribution , a package worth almost double @entity57 ’s £ 142,500 salary			1
he was among 100 headteachers revealed to be earning more than £ 150,000			0
education secretary @entity49 , pictured in @entity60 today , argued in 2010 that heads should not earn more than the prime minister professor @entity63 , an expert on public sector pay , said yesterday : ‘ when the coalition came into power they made it clear they did n’t want people in the public sector to earn more than the pm except in exceptional circumstances			1
‘ the problem is , @entity49 has given away the right to control that by allowing academies to pay what they want			1
’ he added the consequences would continue for decades because heads typically received a taxpayer - funded pension worth half their final salary			0
the situation also prompted fury among unions representing rank - and - file teachers – particularly as ordinary full - time teachers ’ pay has slipped from an average £ 37,900 in november 2011 to £ 37,600 at the end of last year			1
the two largest teachers ’ unions – the @entity90 and @entity91 , which represent 90 per cent of the work force – have already announced strikes later this year over pay , pensions and conditions			2
@entity90 general secretary @entity97 warned the squeeze on pay would affect recruitment			2
teacher numbers are up 4,000 on last year but 6,000 below a peak of 448,100 in 2010			2
‘ it is quite obvious that , despite what the @entity105 says about his plans for the deregulation of pay , it is clearly not about paying a few teachers more but about paying the majority of teachers less , ’ she said			0
‘ we urge @entity49 to reconsider his plans to deregulate pay and to think about a proper increase in teacher salaries			1
’ secondary school pupils are being taught by thousands of teachers who do not hold a degree in their subject , according to @entity44 figures			0
about a quarter of maths teachers – 7,500 – do not have a qualification higher than an a-level			0
the situation is the same with a fifth of @entity129 teachers and a third of physics teachers			0
the figures are even higher in some subjects , with half of those teaching @entity137 and information technology and 40 per cent of religious education teachers not qualified to degree level			0
a department spokesman said 96 per cent of teachers held qualifications at degree - level or above			0
a department spokesman said : ‘ it ’s essential we have the best people in place to lead our schools if we are to raise standards			0
‘ that ’s why decisions on pay are down to schools			2
’ @entity155 , general secretary of the @entity156 , said : ‘ being a headteacher is a hugely demanding and influential role , equal in challenge to most private sector executive positions			0
‘ some posts demand exceptional salaries and in return deliver huge social benefits			0
despite these headlines , however , the average head - teacher ’s salary is £ 55,700			2
‘ on this figure , they have to be a teacher , possess business acumen , an hr expert , a mentor , an administrator , a social worker and an inspirational leader , to name just some of their responsibilities			2

number of school leaders on six - figure salaries rises by 100 in a year
education secretary @entity49 argued no teacher should earn more than the prime minister
experts blame allowing pay levels to be decided by individual schools
