@entity0 has agreed a new contract at @entity2 with the @entity4 superstar set to become the world 's highest - paid player on £ 16.3million a year			1
the player ’s father @entity7 met club officials @entity9 and @entity11 last week and closed what is the seventh new deal in 11 years for the four - time @entity14 winner			1
@entity0 will be 27 in june and the new deal is not expected to extend his existing contract length taking him to 2018			2
@entity29 , the highest - paid player in @entity30 , is on £ 15.6m a year ( £ 300,000 a week )			1
@entity0 ’s previous deals have been structured so that basic pay before bonuses is re-set each year of the deal according to bonuses earned the previous season			2
in effect @entity0 will earn £ 16.3m next season but if he wins the @entity40 the appropriate bonus will be added and the sum total will become his new basic pay level the following season			0
@entity0 ’s £ 250m buy - out clause will remain the same leaving the door open for @entity46 or @entity47 to make a bid , though the rigours of @entity49 surely rule out such a move for either club			1
warming up : @entity0 and his @entity2 team - mates trained on friday ahead of saturday 's crunch clash a statement issued by the @entity56 on friday read : ' @entity2 has reached an agreement to adjust the terms in the contract binding @entity0 to the club as a professional first team player			2
the revised and updated contract will be signed over the next few days			0
' @entity2 had wanted a grand unveiling of @entity0 ’s new deal but time ran out on them as preparations for saturday ’s @entity69 decider against @entity70 took over			1
the player is understood to have put back his return to @entity4 ahead of @entity74 preparations so he can sign the new deal at the start of next week			0
most crucially from the club ’s point of view , @entity0 ’s new deal means @entity2 will now be better placed to tap in to the huge stream of commercial revenue he generates as for the first time since signing his initial deal in 2005 the player will not keep 100 per cent of his image rights - they will now be shared with the club			1
@entity87 finally agreed to the revision in last week ’s crunch meeting			0
in that meeting he was also told that the club ’s new manager for next season will be @entity94			2
new signings were not discussed although it is no secret that the @entity2 forward is close pals with @entity46 striker @entity99 and would love him to join him at the @entity100			0
a bid for @entity99 would only be possible if @entity2 successfully off - loaded forwards @entity102 and @entity104			0
the club are also keen to move on @entity106 and @entity107 as they look to beat @entity108 to the signing of @entity112 ’s @entity111 defender @entity110 .			0

@entity0 now paid more than @entity26 ( £ 15m a year )
@entity116 's highest earner is @entity29 ( £ 15.6m a year )
it 's @entity0 's seventh new deal in 11 years
@entity0 still has £ 250m buyout clause
but he will share his image rights revenue with the club
forward is preparing for @entity2 's title *showdown* with @entity70
@entity0 's father @entity7 told @entity2 's new manager will be @entity94
