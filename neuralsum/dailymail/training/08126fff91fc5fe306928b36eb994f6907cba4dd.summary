by @entity0 the last time @entity2 redesigned its astronauts spacesuits , the result looked like it had been inspired by @entity5 star @entity4			1
for its next model , @entity2 is putting the decision - making process out to a public vote , and is asking people to choose from three protoypes			2
called @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity14 the three suits have been inspired by nature , advances in space technology and how the agency thinks clothes of the future will look			1
@entity2 's @entity20 is the latest prototype in the agency 's z range of spacesuits , and will be the successor to the @entity26 model unveiled in 2012			1
@entity2 has created three designs calls @entity11 , pictured , @entity12 and is asking the public to vote for their favourite the @entity11 suit was inspired by the ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘ the bioluminescent qualities of aquatic creatures found at incredible depths , and the scaly skin of fish and reptiles found across the globe			1
’ the technology suit ‘ pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future ’			2
it is fitted with @entity48 wire and patches that emit light to make it easier to identify crew members during spacewalks , for example			0
the trends in @entity57 suit is ‘ reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future			0
’ it uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech. @entity2 ’s @entity20 is the latest prototype in the agency ’s z range of spacesuits , and will be the successor to the its green and white @entity26 model unveiled in 2012			1
the @entity11 suit was inspired by the ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘ the bioluminescent qualities of aquatic creatures found at incredible depths , and the scaly skin of fish and reptiles found across the globe			2
’ @entity2 said the design reflects the qualities that protect some of ' @entity81 's toughest creatures ' , and specifically includes segmented pleats at the shoulder , elbow , hip and knee			2
it also features electroluminescent wire across the upper torso , which lights up in the dark			0

the @entity20 will be made using 3d printed parts , while 3d human laser scans will be used to accurately size each suit to individual astronauts			1
the z - 2 , technology prototype pictured , will be made using 3d printed parts , while 3d human laser scans will be used to accurately size each suit to the astronaut			1
in a blog post , @entity2 said the designs were created with the intent to protect the suit and to highlight certain mobility features to aid suit testing the @entity11 suit , pictured , was inspired by the ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘ the bioluminescent qualities of aquatic creatures found at incredible depths , and the scaly skin of fish and reptiles found across the globe			1
’ it features electroluminescent wire , pictured right , on the upper torso that lights up in the dark voting closes on 15 april and the winning design will be put into production			1
the suit will then go through tests at the @entity174 in @entity175			1
technology prototype pictured despite claims it looked like a toy suit , @entity2 's @entity26 suit , pictured , was named one of @entity183 's @entity182 of 2012 in a blog post , @entity2 said : ‘ as spacesuit engineers , [ we ] have found ourselves with an exciting opportunity : the chance to make a suit with a look unlike any suit ever built before			1
‘ the designs were created with the intent to protect the suit and to highlight certain mobility features to aid suit testing			0
‘ to take it a step further , we are leaving it up you , the public , to choose which of three candidates will be built			0
’ voting closes on 15 april			1
@entity2 will then put the winning design into production before running it through tests at the @entity174 in @entity175			1
technically , the @entity209 will be built to withstand and absorb impact , especially on the upper and lower torso			0
despite claims it looked like a toy suit , @entity2 ’s @entity26 suit was named one of @entity183 's @entity217			1
‘ after the positive response to the @entity26 suit 's visual design we received , we wanted to take the opportunity to provide this new suit with an equally memorable appearance , ’ continued @entity2			1
‘ the cover layer of a prototype suit is important as it serves to protect the suit against abrasion and snags during the rigors of testing			0
‘ with the @entity20 , we 're looking forward to employing cover layer design elements never used in a spacesuit before			2
‘ the designs were produced in collaboration with suit vendor @entity236 , and @entity238			0
