@entity0 began getting menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes nearly 20 years ago for most women , the menopause is an uncomfortable phase of life where symptoms usually pass within three to years			1
but @entity0 is still struggling more than two decades on			1
nineteen years after she first began experiencing hot flushes , she is still battling them - and says she fears they will never cease			1
appearing today on @entity13 's @entity12 , the mother - of - two said : ' my symptoms began in 1995 , a couple of years after the birth of my second daughter			1
' early menopause is common in my family , but while my mother and grandmother sailed through theirs , mine was terrible from the start			2
' one day , on a visit to @entity26 with my daughter , i had ten hot flushes			1
' i ca n't remember anything we saw because i felt so ill and kept having to run outside for fresh air			0
' mrs @entity0 told hosts @entity32 and @entity34 : ' my periods stopped , my skin started itching and my hair became brittle			1
' before a hot flush , i 'd have a panic attack - it was awful			1
' i did n't know where i was , what i was doing - my self confidence totally went			1
' in the end , i worked it out that a few seconds after the panic attack ...			1
woosh - and my face would be scarlet and dripping in sweat			2
' she said while her symptoms did affect her socially , she had little choice but to get on with life , given that both her daughters were still at school			2
her husband , she says , has been kind and understanding - but her persistent symptoms have dented her self confidence , she said			1
' i could n't take hormone replacement therapy because i have breast cysts , which can lead to an increased risk of cancer if @entity64 is taken			0
' so , i tried every natural remedy , from black cohosh to evening primrose oil			0
' i used oestrogen and progesterone creams to help with the discomfort during sex , but nothing would work			0
in the end , i gave up and thought : " i 'll just have to wait until it 's over "			0
' but it did n't end			0
and many of the symptoms - the itching , soreness and hot flushes - are still with me			1
' i did n't want to make a fuss , so i just coped			0
at its worst , it made me feel very alone , because i could n't believe anyone else could be going through what i was			0
' i had no idea other women had symptoms that were as debilitating or lasted as long			0
' ms @entity0 was speaking out to mark @entity88			1
around four million women in the @entity90 alone go through the menopause every year , with the average age being 51			0
up to 80 per cent of women experience symptoms other than the ceasing of periods , such as hot flushes , mood swings , memory loss , night sweats and painful sex , gp @entity93 told the programme			1
she said : ' i see really successful women who just lose it - they ca n't even decide what pair of knickers to put on in the morning			2
' she went on to explain that women such as @entity0 , who began showing signs at 42 , are considered young for the menopause			1
' anything over 45 but before around 50 is considered early - and anything over 40 is premature			2
' commenting on @entity0 's case , dr @entity93 ( right ) said the symptoms will not go on forever - the flashes and mood swings will get a lot better			1
she added that many women suffer unnecessarily in silence dr @entity93 added that while the age periods begin is based largely on body weight , there is a strong genetic link when it comes to the age of menopause			2
and commenting on @entity0 's case , she said : ' the symptoms will not go on forever - the flashes and mood swings will get a lot better			1
' she went on to explain that many women feel they have to simply put up with symptoms of the menopause - which is wrong			2
' far too many women just accept vaginal dryness and uncomfortable sex			0
' you do n't have to put up with it and you don 'd need to be frightened of @entity64			0
this @entity12 asked viewers which of the following symptoms affected them most when going through the menopause ? they said : hot flushes and night sweats : 49 per cent psychological ( including mood swings and anxiety ) problems : 27 per cent sleep problems : 9 per cent vaginal problems : 8 per cent joint aches : 7 per cent ' it 's not hrt or nothing - for flushes and sweats there is an old - fashioned blood pressure treatment that can help			1
' dryness can be tackled by applying [ the hormone ] oestrogen to the area			0
' there are so many options available - including remaining a healthy weight and eating plenty of soy , which raises oestrogen levels			2
' it 's definitely worth talking to your gp about it			0
' the official definition of the menopause is the last period , with the stage leading up to this known as the perimenopause			0
contrary to popular belief , the average age of the menopause has not changed , says leading expert dr @entity180 , of the website menopause matters			0
' it may be that slowly , more women are beginning to talk about the perimenopause , ' she said			0
the most commonly recognised early symptoms of the menopause include hot flushes , night sweats and disturbed sleep			1
however they may also include bloating , breast tenderness , headaches , tiredness and a general lack of energy , adds dr @entity180			0
' it 's not uncommon for symptoms to be gradual , and come and go , which can confuse the issue			0
' however the most obvious sign is usually a change in the regularity of periods â€“ even in the late thirties or early forties			2

@entity0 , *61* , saw her periods stop when she was just 42
suffered particularly badly with panic attacks before regular hot flushes
nearly 20 years on , is speaking out to *reassure* others they are not alone
says experience has dented her self - esteem but she ' has to get on with life '
