first fifty shades : @entity1 published her erotic novel @entity3 in 1919 aged 39 we all know the story			1
one day , a frustrated , middle - aged housewife decides to write some erotic fiction for her own pleasure			1
the writing style is not brilliant , but what she writes is raunchy , involving a naive young woman forced to submit to a dominant older man , and pushed well beyond her sexual limits			1
quietly pleased , the author decides to publish			2
interest is initially slow , but it picks up beyond her wildest dreams			2
the book sells in its millions on both sides of the @entity19 , is made into a blockbuster @entity21 movie and the author earns a fortune			1
all this success comes despite the fact this tale of abuse and sadomasochism is panned by critics , as ‘ poisonously salacious ’ and glorifying ‘ lust and lechery ’			0
the author is not deterred			0
‘ i am old - fashioned enough to believe a woman ’s best love is given to the man she recognises as her master , ’ she states , and produces two equally saucy sequels			1
you would be forgiven for thinking that this tale is about @entity43 and her mega-selling erotic novel , @entity45 , the movie of which was released in cinemas at the weekend			1
but it is actually the story of another @entity54 writer , a woman born 83 years before @entity43 , whose dazzling success with a piece of highly controversial erotica is an eerily familiar forerunner to @entity45			1
stranger still , even her name is similar : @entity1			1
today , her name is largely forgotten , but many will know the 1921 film that was based on her epically successful novel — the sheik			1
starring @entity62 and @entity63 , the film tells how a young @entity54 aristocrat called @entity65 is kidnapped by a sheik , who holds her against her will until she falls in love with him			1
however , the film is tame compared with the book , in which @entity72 is repeatedly raped — and there are strong hints that the sheik sodomises her — until she submits to his will and accepts she must be his for ever			1
the notion that a woman can fall for her abuser is extremely unpalatable , and when @entity85 ’s book was released in 1919 , that sense of distaste was widely felt			1
‘ to state her theory concisely : the quickest way to reach a woman ’s heart is a right hook to the jaw , ’ wrote one critic			2
b ecause of this apparent subtext , many believed @entity1 was a man			1
in fact , @entity1 was @entity98 , the 39 - year - old wife of a @entity100 pig breeder			1
she was born on august 16 , 1880 in @entity101 , the second child of a @entity104 ship owner and his @entity106 opera singer wife			0
the family was prosperous , and lived in a large house in @entity109			0
they holidayed on the @entity111 , and at some point moved to @entity113			0
the sheik : the 1921 film version of @entity1 's @entity3 , starring @entity62 and @entity63 , tells how a young aristocrat is kidnapped by a sheik , who holds her against her will until she falls in love with him vanilla version : the film is tame compared with the book , in which @entity72 is repeatedly raped until she submits to his will and accepts she must be his for ever in 1899 , the 19 - year - old @entity98 married a 30 - year - old civil engineer called @entity85 , who came from a family of @entity100 landowners			1
his father had been a barrister , and the @entity132 lived in splendour in a large house called @entity135 , near the village of @entity137 , five miles north of @entity138			0
a picture taken of @entity98 at her wedding — which is the only photograph of her to be published , and is printed here for the first time — shows the model of a @entity145 bride , accepting of a life of predictable gentility			2
in 1902 , @entity98 gave birth to their only child — a girl called @entity151			0
the couple gave her a boy ’s name because they ’d wanted a boy — a measure of the immensely socially conservative world in which @entity98 lived , and against which she would rebel , at least on paper			0
at the outbreak of war in 1914 , @entity163 was called up			0
at 45 , he would have been too old for the frontline , but it is likely his engineering skills were put to use			0
it was while her husband was absent that a frustrated and bored @entity98 picked up her pen			0
she said she wrote @entity3 ‘ as a means of distraction at a time when i felt very much alone ’			1
‘ oh @entity178 ! how she loved him ! ’ reads a typical passage			0
‘ @entity179 ! and with a soundless cry the last remnant of her strength went all at once , and she fell weakly against the chief			0
he forced her to her knees , and , with his hand twined brutally in her curls , thrust her head back			0
there was a mad light in his eyes and a foam on his lips as he dragged the knife from his waistbelt			0
’ another section reads : ‘ her body was aching with the grip of his powerful arms , her mouth was bruised with his savage kisses			0
she clenched her hands in anguish			0
“ oh , @entity178 ! ” she sobbed , with scalding tears that scorched her cheeks			0
“ curse him ! curse him ! ” ’ @entity98 submitted her sadomasochistic tale to agent @entity208 , who sold it to a publisher in may 1919			2
what happened nearly a century ago is a parallel to the @entity45 phenomenon			0
publicised purely by word of mouth , the book was snapped up largely by women , despite — or more likely , because — it was described as ‘ lascivious pornography ’			0
copycat : nearly 100 years later , an erotic novel written by a woman is once again dominating the bestseller lists and being turned into a @entity21 blockbuster - @entity45 unlike @entity45 , @entity98 ’s book is not openly explicit , but the strong suggestions of violence , rape and sodomy were enough to make it sell 1.2 million copies in hardback alone			1
we do n’t know the total number of sales in all editions , but do know that @entity3 sold more than all the other bestselling books of the inter-war period put together			1
simiilarly , @entity43 ’s first novel in her @entity45 trilogy has outsold all seven @entity240 books on @entity242 ’s @entity54 site			1
as a result , both women earned a fortune			0
for the last reported financial year , @entity43 ’s limited company turned over £ 44 million , netting her a post-tax profit of £ 25.4 million in that one year			0
@entity85 ’s earnings were comparable			1
she sold the film rights to @entity3 for $ 5,000 , which today would be around £ 500,000 , and the theatrical rights for the equivalent of £ 100,000			1
@entity98 then sold the serial rights for three novels to a magazine for £ 300,000 at today ’s value			0
in 1923 , an american film company bought the rights to another of @entity98 ’s saucy novels , @entity262 , for £ 2.5 million in today ’s money			2
and in 1925 , she sold the sequel to @entity3 to @entity266 films for £ 2 million			1
including royalties for the eight books she published , she would easily have made the equivalent of £ 50 million			1
@entity98 and her husband lived in luxury at @entity135 , where @entity163 took up breeding prize - winning pigs			2
despite her success , @entity98 remained an intensely private figure , and did not even go to the first night of @entity3 when it was shown in @entity138			1
by some accounts , she was an austere figure			0
a great - niece recalled visiting her during the war , and being picked up from the station , despite petrol rationing , in a luxurious @entity282			2
‘ she was definitely of the “ children should be seen , not heard ” school of thought , ’ the great - niece wrote			2
in march 1944 , @entity163 died at the age of 74			0
@entity98 died three years later , aged just 66			2
today , her legacy is still hotly debated			0
some see @entity3 — aimed as it was at women — as being part of a rising tide of female emancipation , whereas other regard it as appallingly reactionary			1
whatever your view , there ’s no doubt the phenomenon of @entity45 is a story that has been told before , and will be told again			2
by another unassuming woman who will make a fortune .			2
