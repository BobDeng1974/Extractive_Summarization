by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 14 october 2013 stunning new images of @entity4 ' ‘ @entity3 ’ have been captured in @entity5 by the @entity6 ’s @entity7			1
the deep valley , named @entity9 , is a strange 196 - mile ( 315km ) scar that sits almost right in the middle of the @entity4 equator on the northern edge of the @entity15 canyon			1
it is an enclosed , almost 8 km - deep trough stretching 315 km in an east – west direction and 125 km from north to south at its widest point			0
numerous grooves are etched into the mountain , suggesting the material is weak and easily eroded scientists hope that @entity9 and its neighbouring network of canyons could provide new insights into @entity4 ’ ancient geological upheaval			1
@entity6 ’s @entity7 has flown over this region of @entity4 on numerous occasions , but this new eight - image mosaic reveals @entity9 in full and in greater detail than ever before			1
by imaging the landscape at three different wavelengths , the space agency has provides an insight into how the canyon will look from various angles			0
ripped apart by tectonic forces , the origin of @entity9 and neighbouring canyons is associated with the nearby volcanic @entity44 , a huge region on @entity4 formed during its ancient volcanic history			1
a horseshoe - shaped chunk has been taken out of one side of the mound ( left in this image ) ; the material has slumped down onto the floor of the valley below			2
a dark patch appears to pool like spilt ink across the debris			0
it is most likely loose material that has slid down the walls from an intermediate layer the mosaic of @entity9 is composed of eight single images taken with the @entity62 on @entity7 ( left )			2
scientists hope that @entity9 and its neighbouring network of canyons could provide new insights into @entity4 ' ancient geological upheaval			1
a colour - coded topography map ( right ) shows the relative heights and depths of features in and around the @entity9			1
@entity72 and red show the highest terrains , while blue and purple show the deepest as the @entity44 bulge swelled with magma during the planet ’s first billion years , the surrounding crust was stretched , eventually ripping apart and collapsing into massive troughs			2
one of these was @entity9 , and the complex fault patterns can be seen all around the deep depression and are especially evident in the main colour and @entity5 images			2
at the centre of @entity9 is a flat - topped ‘ mesa ’ - an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides			2
no other canyon on @entity4 has a similar feature and its origin is not entirely clear			2
its layers include volcanic materials but also wind - blow dust and lake sediments that were laid down over time			0

ripped apart by tectonic forces , the origin of @entity9 and neighbouring canyons is associated with the nearby volcanic @entity44 a horseshoe - shaped chunk has been taken out of one side of the mesa where material has slumped down onto the valley floor below			1
a similar feature is visible at the opposite end of the mound , as seen in the full - colour image			0
other landslide deposits are seen all over the floor of @entity9 , many coming from the main canyon walls			1
the canyon walls and the mesa feature a number of grooves , suggesting the material is weak and easily eroded			0
in another image , a band of darker material is seen between two layers of light material			0
the @entity9 is located at about 1 ° s / 284 ° e , and 300 km north of @entity15			0
its layers include volcanic materials but also wind - blow dust and lake sediments that were laid down over time one idea is that the material was blown or slid from the top of the mound and collected on the slopes below			0
dark material is also seen around the base of the mesa , which either eroded away from the younger sediment layers located higher up in the mesa , or were deposited separately by wind or water			0
other layers revealed in the sides of the mesa may also have been deposited by water			0
data from both @entity7 and @entity153 ’s @entity152 reveal that some parts of @entity9 are laced with minerals that can form only in the presence of water , suggesting that at some point in the @entity4 ’s history the canyon might have been filled with a lake			1
according to @entity6 , however , the chaotic debris that fills the canyon floor shows that enormous landslides also played a key role in shaping and widening this deep scar since its formation .			1

@entity9 is a 196 - mile scar that sits close to the @entity4 equator
@entity172 is associated with tectonic shifts from the volcanic @entity44
the debris that fills the canyon floor shows that enormous landslides also played a key role in shaping
