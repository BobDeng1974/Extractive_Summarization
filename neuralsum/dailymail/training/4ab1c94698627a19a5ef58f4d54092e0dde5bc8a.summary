@entity0 are considering a £ 100million bid to buy @entity2			1
@entity2 has come to the fore for @entity4 for the first time this season since his £ 75m move from @entity8 last summer			1
the @entity10 's two goals in @entity4 's 2 - 1 win at the @entity12 would seem to have given @entity0 no way back when it comes to the @entity15 last - 16 second leg at the @entity17			1
@entity2 scored twice on his return to @entity19 this week against @entity0 at the @entity12 @entity2 added a third goal for the week , and created another , against @entity22 on saturday but overall since joining @entity4 things have not worked out well for @entity2			1
@entity25 sources have been told that the club would like to move the striker on			1
city are aware of that and would pay a huge amount to take the player now that they realise that their ambition to sign @entity34 is unlikely to ever come to fruition			1
the major stumbling block to any deal this summer is that @entity4 remain under a transfer embargo until 2016 in the wake breaches of @entity38 regulations			1
before this week @entity2 had not hit the heights expected at @entity4 , and the club are keen to get rid of him @entity44 could be used as a makeweight as @entity4 can not make any new signings until next january so even if the @entity48 cashed in on @entity2 they could not sign a replacement until the next january transfer window			1
it is understood however that a straight swap of @entity44 and @entity2 is not out of the question			1
@entity54 believes he will get a move to @entity8 or @entity0 this summer			1
but after another dire display for @entity57 – this time in the 3 - 1 defeat against @entity59 may find that @entity61 clubs wo n't want to pick up his hefty wages			1
song is on loan at the @entity57 from @entity4 and , after an excellent start to the season , his form has dipped massively			1
@entity54 's form has dropped off significantly since the start of the season , but he still wants a big move @entity57 are picking up the thick end of his £ 140,000 - a - week salary and are now less likely to make the move permanent			1
@entity8 may still be interested given @entity76 's departure			2
but why would they pay that much to @entity54 when they are in dispute with @entity78 over his demands for £ 120,000 - a - week ? it is understood , however , that @entity78 will sign soon given that interest from @entity82 has over blown			1
song believes he can play for a @entity15 club , but his wage demands could be a sticking point @entity87 , who spearheaded @entity89 's 3 - 1 win over @entity90 , wants one last hurrah in the @entity61 next season			1
@entity87 still has a house in @entity93 , @entity94			1
@entity87 , who scored against @entity90 this week and has a house in @entity94 , wants a return to @entity19 he would like to play for @entity57 and even at 34 believes he could still do a job at that level			1
@entity100 beat @entity57 3 - 1 , with all goals coming from set pieces			1
that means that @entity100 have now scored 18 @entity61 goals this season from set pieces - by far more than any other team			1
not a lot of people know that			2
@entity112 scores yet another goal from a @entity59 set piece in the game against @entity57 @entity115 has hit back at reports that he has snubbed former club @entity117 for 45 years since he left @entity117			1
it was stated in an article by a newspaper that @entity115 has never been back to watch a game at @entity122 since he moved to @entity57 in 1970			1
but @entity115 said : ' as a @entity125 reporter then a tv reporter i went there loads of times			2
i launched my autobiography there and i attended the funerals of both @entity133 and @entity134			2
' but i do n't go to games			2
it 's not just @entity117			2
i do n't go to any of my other clubs either			2
' and @entity115 , who turned 75 last week , insists he did not turn down an invitation from @entity117 to be a guest of honour at @entity141 for the @entity143 final against @entity144 - the club where he started his career			1
' there was no invitation forthcoming but i would n't have gone if they did , ' he said			2
' i 've got a lovely giant screen tv , a lovely dog and a warm fire			2
that 's where i watch sport and it 's very nice			0
i 'm not interested in driving in heavy traffic and enduring big crowds and being freezing cold			0
i love it on tv			0
' and no doubt if the @entity117 - @entity144 game gets a bit dull for @entity164 he will flick channels to watch the @entity168 crunch clash between @entity19 and @entity169			0
during a speech he made at a dinner recently greaves made it clear he tires of the antics of footballers and has grown to prefer rugby union			0
@entity177 will choose between @entity178 and @entity179 when his contract at @entity4 expires this summer			1
@entity181 retired at the end of last season @entity57 boss @entity184 has backed a call for @entity181 to return to refereeing			1
@entity181 hung up his whistle last summer after officiating at the @entity187			1
he has taken up a role at the @entity189 but former ref chief @entity190 believes @entity181 is wasted			2
' most agree @entity181 was our top referee and had been for many seasons			2
there has been a dip in standards this season and one of the reasons is because @entity181 is not around and one or two refs have been moved up to the big games and they are not good enough , ' said @entity190			2
' @entity181 is only 43			0
there is no doubt he has several more seasons in him			0
' @entity184 agreed : ' @entity181 should come back out of his retirement			0
he was a referee who has the ability to manage to games and has been missed this season			2
' i am hearing @entity0 are still keen on luring @entity209 from @entity179			1
the former @entity178 youth product is valued in the region of £ 60 million			0
city could offer @entity213 as part of the deal , although @entity216 would enter the market should the @entity218 become available			1
@entity0 are interested in @entity179 ' former @entity178 midfielder @entity209 i am also hearing @entity184 has recommended that @entity220 can help solve @entity19 's problems at centre half and has also told @entity19 boss @entity223 he should pick @entity224 to add energy to his midfield			1
i say : it was interesting to attend an event of you are @entity230 , a website run by former referee @entity190 in the week			0
another ex-ref @entity232 was on the panel alongside @entity57 boss @entity184 at @entity235 's sports bar in @entity237 's @entity236			1
many issues were discussed to an impressively attentive audience			0
most interesting was @entity190 's proposal to get rid of yellow cards , introduce a sin bin and reserve sending offs for only the most serious offences			0
@entity190 has already raised the matter with the @entity248 who agree and want the @entity250 to go ahead with a trial run in the conference			0
' one of the big problems in the game right now is that we have a confetti card culture , ' said @entity190			0
@entity190 is keen to get rid of red cards for two bookings , like the one given to @entity260 on sunday ' refs are under directions to issue cards for all sorts of technical offences			0
too often we see games ruined because a team has seen a player sent off for two ' soft ' yellows			0
it also promotes a climate of confrontation			0
' what we need is for refs to be allowed to manage games			0
if a player has made a bad foul the ref should warn him and if he transgresses then he goes into the sin bin			0
' @entity184 backed the proposal : ' i like @entity190 's idea of getting rid of yellow cards and examining how a sin bin for say 10 - 15 minutes would work for a player who has totted up what would amount two yellows			0
' it has an immediate impact but for a period of time without affecting the whole match			0
we have seen it work in rugby so why not give it a go ? ' btw it was good to be in the company of many former @entity117 stars during the week at @entity300 for the launch the new football social media site @entity303 – listening to @entity304 and @entity305 in a heated debate about politics and religion was absorbing			0
but it was n't about all our yesterdays			0
indeed it was a pleasure to meet @entity313 @entity312 who revealed that he was ready to return to @entity61 action having undergone surgery to remove his left testicle due to cancer last september			1
indeed , the 31 - year - old @entity321 winger was in the @entity323 squad for saturday 's win against @entity325			0
he was engaging company and an inspiration to listen to			0
it is to be hoped he revives his career			0
testicular cancer affect men between the ages of 15 and 49			0
it accounts for 1 per cent of cancers that occur in men			0
more than 96 per cent treated early will be cured @entity335 : @entity117 have a habit of seeing a season blow up in their face within a week			2
while it was a great comeback to draw against @entity57 , failure to win hit their top four hopes ; then they were dumped out of the @entity342 by @entity343			1
and @entity144 are hot favourites to win the @entity143 , coral quoting 4 - 7			0
@entity344 is a good shout as top goalscorer in the @entity143 final , but @entity144 are hot favourites the draw at 90 minutes is 16 - 5			2
optimistic @entity117 fans will surely be tempted by 5 - 1 on them winning			0
first goalscorer ? @entity344 in 7 - 1			0
and for a value punt @entity351 is 20 - 1 .			0

@entity2 scored twice against @entity0 in @entity15
city lining up a monster bid for the forward , who has not *settled* in @entity359
@entity44 could be used in a swap deal to bring @entity2 to @entity362
@entity54 believes he will get a move to top club this summer despite @entity57 form dropping off
@entity87 wants a @entity61 return next season
