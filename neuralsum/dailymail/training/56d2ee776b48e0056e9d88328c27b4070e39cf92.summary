awkward : seen in 2003 before their alleged affair began , @entity19 was married when he said that @entity2 attempted to seduce him by making out with him in his car and in her apartment @entity26 denies the affair , saying that she refused his advances at a @entity65 party by telling him : ‘ a kiss is cheating , @entity19			1
you 're a married man			0
’ joint appearance : @entity19 , seen here with @entity26 in 2008 , admitted that he did hack into her email account and send damaging emails to other reporters one aspect of their affair that neither of them denies is that @entity19 , upset about the end of their alleged affair , broke into @entity26 's work email and began sending messages to newspaper reporters throughout the city to damage her reputation			1

@entity19 admitted the email hacking to police , was fired from his $ 700,000 - a - year job and served six months house arrest			1
the legal spotlight then turned to @entity26 in december 2007 , who was arrested for an unrelated case when she allegedly punched a plainclothes police woman during a trip to @entity101 , calling the officer a ' f * * * * * * dyke b * * * * ' during a drunken rage			1

emails between @entity26 and her lawyers following the @entity101 incident were also said to be some of the ones that @entity19 leaked to fellow journalists			2

strike a pose : in one of her flirty emails with @entity122 , he called @entity26 a ' rhyming vixen ' men - and their wives - in her life : @entity19 is married to @entity134 anchor @entity54 ( left ) and @entity122 is married to fellow sports journalist @entity135 ( right ) legal issues : @entity26 , seen with her then - boyfriend @entity137 , was arrested but never charged with punching a police woman in the face during a trip to @entity101 dating back to 2008 , the married @entity122 and then - single @entity26 wrote to each other referring to an encounter in @entity144 , and the regularly included extremely friendly phrases , like ' i 'm sweet on you kid ' ( @entity122 to @entity26 ) , and ' i 'm just glad you 're in my life = ) ' ( @entity26 to @entity122 )			1

as a result , her computer records were extremely important to the case , making it an issue that she could not specifically remember when she went to an @entity183 store and had the staff clear out her hard drive - whether it was in the spring or summer of 2007 , or if it was in @entity101 or in @entity29			2
@entity13 lawyers obtained records from the @entity6 which shows that she had the laptop memory cleared in late 2008 , after she filed the lawsuit , suggesting that she was deleting possible evidence			0
