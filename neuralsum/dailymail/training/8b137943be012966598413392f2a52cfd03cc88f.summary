by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:59 est , 17 february 2014 supermarkets seem to be deliberately organised to make it as hard as possible to find what you ’re looking for			0
to solve this problem , @entity8 - based firm @entity6 is trialling a system that creates a gps - style grid on a smartphone or tablet , and can be used by customers to plan their route around individual stores			1
shoppers input ingredients from a recipe , or food items from their weekly shopping list , and the app will plot the best route to take as well as highlight the exact location of each item			2
@entity6 is trialling a system that connects smart lighting in supermarkets , stock image pictured , to an app. this creates a gps - style grid on a smartphone			1
shoppers input ingredients from a recipe and the app will plot the best route to take as well as highlight the locations of each item when a customer enters a supermarket and opens the dedicated smartphone app , a positioning grid appears onscreen			1
this tells the user the route they need to take to get everything on their shopping list - either from recipes or other lists			1
the system works by using a network of ‘ intelligent led in - store lights ’ that act as a gps - style grid			1
each light is plotted on the grid and can send its position to the app. as customers move around the store , relevant discounts and offers also appear for nearby products			1
similarly , if someone is looking for generic ‘ dessert ’ ideas , the app can guide them top the pastry section and offer suggestions			0
as they move around the store , the app shows relevant discounts and offers for nearby products , and can even offer suggestions for alternative products if the ones the customer wants have sold out			1

it tells the user the route they need to take to get everything on their shopping list and the shopper can follow the map in a similar way to how they would follow a satnav			2

this infographic explains how @entity6 ' smart lighting system works			2
if a shopper plans to make @entity113 dinner , the app guides them to the aisle where they will find guacamole			0
alternatively , if they want to make it fresh , the app guides them through the aisles to avocados , tomatoes , onions , chilies and limes as customers move around the store , relevant discounts and offers will appear for nearby products , pictured in the illustration left			1
the app can also make suggestions for alternate recipes or desserts , illustrated right for example , if a shopper plans to make @entity113 food for dinner , the app works like a ‘ personal shopper			0
’ it guides the shopper to the aisle where they will find a jar of guacamole			0
alternatively , if they want to make it fresh , the app plots a route through the aisles to the avocados , tomatoes , onions , chilies and limes			0
as the shopper approaches various products , the app can introduce new brands available in the store , or make suggestions for alternate recipes			2
the lighting system is currently being piloted with select retailers and is on display at trade show euroshop in @entity168			0
‘ the beauty of the system is that retailers do not have to invest in additional infrastructure to house , power and support location beacons for indoor positioning , ’ said @entity169 from @entity6			0
‘ the light fixtures themselves can communicate this information by virtue of their presence everywhere in the store .			0
