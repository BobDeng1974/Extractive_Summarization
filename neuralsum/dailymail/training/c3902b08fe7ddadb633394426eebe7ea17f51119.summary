by @entity1 reporter published : 19:43 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 03:20 est , 1 august 2013 drivers in remote areas could pay less for their petrol and diesel under @entity7 plans to cut fuel duty			1
residents of the @entity11 islands and the @entity12 already receive a 5p discount on their fuel because the costs of transporting it means prices are higher than on the mainland			1
now ministers are considering extending this island fuel rebate scheme to other areas including parts of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
the campaign group @entity25 said that even if the consultation was successful it would only help a small number of people and businesses the government will collect price details from fuel retailers in 35 remote regions before seeking the right to implement the move from the @entity36			1
a cut in fuel duty is defined as state aid under @entity41 law and must receive permission from @entity43 to go ahead			1
the overall cost of the scheme will depend on the number of areas affected , but it is likely to run into millions of pounds as retailers would be able to claim back lost revenue from the @entity51			2
chief secretary to the treasury @entity52 said it would not be easy to gain approval from @entity56			0
he said : ‘ the island fuel rebate provides much needed help to keep down fuel prices in areas where costs of transporting fuel mean prices are much higher			2
‘ i know that there are other remote rural areas of the @entity67 with similarly high fuel costs			2
residents of the @entity12 already receive a 5p discount on their fuel because the costs of transporting it means prices are higher than on the mainland ‘ so we are starting to gather further evidence that will form part of an application to the @entity36 to extend the island fuel duty discount scheme to very remote rural areas			1
‘ we will need to prove there are areas which are similar to the islands in terms of pump prices and distribution costs so i would urge local areas that may qualify to provide the information we need to make the case as robust as possible			2
‘ as a @entity90 , i know that for people who live in rural areas driving is not a choice , but a necessity			0
so while it wo n’t be easy to get this agreed with the @entity36 , i want to do everything i can to make this happen			0
’ the campaign group @entity25 said that even if the consultation was successful it would only help a small number of people and businesses			0
instead , it called for a fuel duty cut across the whole country			2
spokesman @entity105 said : ‘ i welcome the @entity107 ’s acknowledgement that the @entity67 needs a duty cut , but we need it across the country , not just for remote communities			0
everybody is hurting , not just the few			0
’ @entity113 , president of the @entity114 , said help for motorists was good news , but all road users needed lower fuel costs			0
he added : ‘ it is quite hard to define a rural area			0
‘ our analysis showed that if you have a supermarket close by , that will bring prices down			0
‘ the government needs to take measures to increase fuel price transparency as petrol costs and duty are too high generally			0
’ nearly 1,500 retailers in @entity132 , @entity24 , @entity11 and @entity133 are being consulted			1
the @entity107 said it was most interested in identifying areas where prices were consistently similar to those on the islands that already fall under the scheme			1
but places where prices were consistently lower than those on the islands currently covered are ‘ extremely unlikely ’ to be included in any extension of the discount scheme			1
fuel retailers in the following areas are being asked to submit price data : @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity23 , @entity22 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172			1
@entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , and @entity184 .			0

the @entity11 islands and @entity12 already receive 5p discount on their fuel
ministers may extend scheme to parts of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24
