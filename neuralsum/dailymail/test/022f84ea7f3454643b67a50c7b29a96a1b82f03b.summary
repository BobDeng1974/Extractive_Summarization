when retired hairdresser @entity1 , 71 , moved into a new - build flat in @entity2 five years ago , the frail pensioner thought she had found her dream home			1
but after a blocked pipe unleashed a ' tsunami of sewage ' from the nine - storey building 's 239 other flats into her apartment , her hopes of a contented retirement were ruined - and she says she now hopes to move			1
mrs @entity1 's nightmare began when she noticed a foul smell coming from her bathroom and discovered an unidentifiable brown substance bubbling up through the plughole in her bath			1
within half an hour , it [ the bath ] was over half full			2
' but worse was to come			0
' 10 , 20 minutes later , the bath stopped filling but the toilet , it made a terrific noise and then , when i looked , it was half full			2
' then it started filling up and filling up and filling up			0
and then it was gushing out			0
it started flooding the flat everywhere			2
' with raw sewage pouring into her flat , mrs @entity1 phoned her daughter @entity41 and grandson @entity42 and begged them to come to her aid			1
she also got in touch with the company in charge of maintaining the nine - story block of flats to tell them that waste was pouring into her flat			1
' i phoned the maintenance people and i said , it looks like sewage stuff coming out the bath			1
he said , sorry , no , no , no , you should get a plumber because i 'm busy and it 's sunday			2
disgusting : the flood started with her bath , which started filling up with ' brown lumps ' overflowing : mrs @entity1 's toilet began overflowing with sewage ' like a volcano ' according to grandson @entity42 revolting : the toilet and bath both began overflowing with sewage , flooding mrs @entity1 's flat in the process ' when the man arrived , it was too late			1
' @entity76 was one of the first to come to his grandmother 's aid and says the toilet resembled a ' volcano '			2
' i came in through the front door and i could see the toilet , ' he remembers			0
' it was like a volcano , that 's how bad it was			2
you could see she was visibly distraught			0
' but worse was to come			0
despite the best efforts of the plumber , who spent four hours trying to stem the tide of sewage , the excrement was strewn all over the flat and had soaked into carpets			1
worst of all was the mess in her bedroom which , according to daughter @entity41 , both smelled ' foul ' and ' was unhealthy ' thanks to the sodden carpet			1
maintenance workers , however , were unable to visit for four days - leaving a distressed mrs @entity1 to sleep in a room filled with sewage for three nights			1
devastated : the disgusting episode has left mrs @entity1 desperate to find a new home furious : mrs @entity1 's daughter @entity41 and grandson @entity42 were took part in the clean - up operation damage : mrs @entity1 's bedroom carpet was soaked in sewage and had to be replaced afterwards ' the bedroom it was soaked , ' she says			1
' the carpet was full of sewage but i was still sleeping in there			2
i felt dirty , i could n't eat			0
all i was doing was just crying			0
' eventually , workmen came in to remove the carpet but when they lifted it up , the movement caused her wardrobe to collapse - soaking everything in it in sewage			1
it was , says @entity41 , the final straw for her mother			0
' it was one thing after another and it just destroyed her flat completely , ' she says			0
' it almost gave her a nervous breakdown			0
' although mrs @entity1 's carpet has now been replaced and her flat fumigated , she says the experience has left her desperate to find a new home			1
' if i could afford to move , i would move from here tomorrow because i just do n't feel happy any more , ' she says			0
' but i do n't know how i 'm going to be able to do it			0
i 'm just going to have to wait			0
