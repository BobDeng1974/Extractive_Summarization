@entity0 is known for walking a risky line in dealing with race in his films , and completely flies past it when it comes to the use of violence			2
his latest film , called @entity10 , is no different and the setting of the slave - filled @entity13 south in the years prior to the @entity14 has many crying foul at his use of racial slurs			1
this is not the first time that @entity0 has been criticized for his use of the n - word , as @entity22 took issue with its use in the 1997 film @entity26 where the controversial director allowed it to be used 38 times			1
the latest film , which will open on christmas day , focuses on the partnership between a former slave who becomes a bounty hunter who enjoys killing white people in his pursuit for his captured wife			1
scroll down for the trailer @entity38 unchained : @entity40 's character goes from being a slave in a chain gang to a bounty hunter scars of slavery : the trailer shows the back of some slaves , which clearly displays the abuse they felt a the hands of their masters in @entity52 a screening of the film on tuesday led to reviews that warn of extreme violence and excessive cursing			1
' quite naturally , given the historical setting , the n - word gets a heavy workout , by whites and blacks alike			2
but much more forceful is the cruelty dispensed by the @entity67 whites , both as punishment and whim , ' a review in the @entity64 says			0
among the scarring acts are instances when attack dogs are released on a man , and black fighters are forced to fight to the death in an ornate drawing room simply for the entertainment of a white plantation owner			0
trailers for the film make no attempts to veil the violence , as the main character @entity38 , played by @entity40 , is shown to have painful scars on his back to imply that he had a history of being beaten			0
adding to the inherent violence is the fact that @entity40 pairs up with @entity93 's character of dr. @entity10 , a @entity94 bounty hunter who comes to @entity52 looking to kill a set of brothers that @entity38 is able to identify			1
the pair go on a coordinated killing spree looking for the brothers in question , and using their guns and whips as a way of achieving vengeance			0
bloodshed in the cotton fields : a clip from the trailer hints at the level of violence depicted throughout grim work : the two lead characters partner up as bounty hunters to kill a group of brothers who had wronged someone , and in the process they kill a number of people at one point , @entity118 asks @entity38 if he enjoys his new role as a bounty hunter , and the former slave replies ' kill white folks and they pay you for it - what 's not to like ? ' @entity40 used the same line during his opening monologue while hosting @entity128 last week - as part of the promotion of the film - and brushed off the ensuing criticism saying that he is a comedian and it is meant as a joke			1
' of course there are hot button issues -- the language and violence , and everything like that but the way ( the film ) landed , i mean when you watch this play in front of an audience , it 's amazing , ' @entity40 said of the film during an appearance on @entity150			0
reunion : @entity0 was also reunited with his @entity153 star @entity152 who arrived at the premiere in a warm woolly hat stars of the show : @entity158 and @entity40 take on the lead roles in @entity0 's latest film ' it takes you to those moments that are dark and tough to watch , but ( there ) are a lot of moments that come from out of nowhere that makes the whole audience bubble up			2
' the actor has some personal connections to the racial prejudices shown in the film , and during one press event he said that he was frequently faced with the n - word while growing up in @entity52			1
' being called a n * * * * * as a young kid by white people was something i had to deal with , ' @entity40 said			0
' having that done to me i was able to grasp what was going on in the script			0
when a project becomes magic and special it means that at certain points in the script it parallels your story			0
' he is not the only prominent @entity190 to have embraced the sensitive material , as the actor said that a number of his friends including @entity195 have seen the film and , because they came in braced for the typical @entity0 level of violence , they enjoyed it overall			2

@entity10 set in @entity52 and pits a former slave against his tormentors when he becomes a bounty hunter
early reviews of the film claim the n - word is used frequently by black and white characters , but the level of violence is even more *disturbing*
not the first time that @entity0 has gotten in trouble for use of racial slur
in his 1997 film @entity26 , the n - word was used 38 times
