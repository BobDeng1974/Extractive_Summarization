by @entity0 last updated at 12:27 pm on 28th june 2011 a lost emperor penguin is slowly improving after a lifesaving operation by a top @entity4 surgeon - despite nearly 7lb of sand being removed from its stomach			1
it has been drawn out with the help of a special camera that identified its position in the penguin 's stomach			0
vets say a large amount still remains , but they hope it will be flushed from its body in coming days after the 10 - month - old bird - nicknamed ' @entity17 ' - has been fed a mixture of oil , fish and laxatives			2
it came ashore after losing its way while looking for food in @entity45 , 3,000 miles a way			1
@entity47 , a vet at @entity36 , said : ' he 's slowly regaining his strength , which is just wonderful news			0
' @entity50 , a leading gastroenterologist at @entity51 , donated his skills to remove sand , sticks and stones from the bird 's stomach			0
the penguin has been put under an anaesthetic three times in the four days it has been at the zoo while a number of operations have been carried out to clear its throat and stomach			0
the doctor will see you now : one of @entity4 's top surgeons @entity50 ( second right ) led a medical team to perform an endoscopy on the ailing emperor penguin			1
they removed twigs , stones and sand clogging the penguin 's gut p - p - p - poorly : happy feet in his enclosure ( left ) after an x-ray showed what had been clogging the emperor penguin 's gut dr @entity50 said : ' hopefully , with a bit of luck , the stomach will now start function of its own accord			1
' the bird was really clogged up and it was getting more poorly by the day			0
' ms @entity47 added : ' yesterday he actually punched me in the stomach with his flipper			0
' he 's been calling and it 's really awesome to hear that emperor penguin call for real and not just on a documentary			2
' experts have said it could be months before @entity17 is strong enough to be taken by ship to a @entity103 strip of land in the hope that it will be able to finds its way home			2
the last sighting of an emperor penguin - the largest of the species - in @entity4 was in 1967			1
wrong turn : the emperor penguin washed up on @entity113 in @entity4 - 3,000 miles north of its home in @entity45			1

emperor penguin from @entity45 took wrong turn and ended up 3,000 miles away in @entity4
happy feet ate wet sand to keep cool , *mistaking* it for snow
vets warn it could be months before bird is strong enough to try and return home
ship may be able to take penguin to @entity130 amid hopes it can find way back
