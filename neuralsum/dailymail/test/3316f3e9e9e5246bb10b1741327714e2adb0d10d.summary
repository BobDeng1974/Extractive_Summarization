this year has seen a rash of massive dust storms around the world that have led to travel chaos and blocked out sunlight - but experts can not pinpoint the reason behind the spate			1
this week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual ' apocalyptic ' dust storm , known in @entity11 as a haboob , struck @entity13 , turning day to night , and @entity14 has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year			1
some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms , but one @entity23 scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable			1
dark clouds start forming over the city of @entity28 , @entity13 , as a sandstorm sweeps over the city within a matter of minutes , the storm had blocked out the sun , creating chaos on the city streets a raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of @entity38 in north west @entity14 , where 200,000 people live the sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards @entity14 's @entity45 issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country @entity38 was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city the footage of the dust storm in @entity13 , filmed from a high rise apartment , shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of @entity28 , south of the capital of @entity60 on monday afternoon			1
as dark clouds move over the city , the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads			0
the storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the @entity71 - @entity70 border , reported @entity72 earlier this month @entity73 was shrouded in a cloud of @entity76 dust , known as ' blood rain , ' as the temperatures soared			1
blurred : the @entity79 , one of @entity81 's most iconic buildings , is pictured shrouded in ' blood rain ' earlier this month in december a small town in @entity84 , @entity85 , experienced a dust storm ( pictured ) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude dr @entity89 , a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at @entity93 , explained how these events can occur			1
' the dust is produced from source areas in @entity97 , incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the @entity73			2
' however , the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources			2
and incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of april showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms devoured a city in @entity14 's north west			1
@entity14 's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north - west of the country being the fourth this year alone			1
the images show the city of @entity38 , in the country 's north west @entity120 , as it succumbs to a sweeping half - hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres , according to @entity123			2
on april 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of @entity125 and the @entity126 by april 4 , it was beginning to stretch across the @entity128 towards @entity129 and @entity130 @entity14 's @entity131 ( @entity132 ) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms			1
the red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
the organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean - up operation after the sandstorms			2
@entity14 's four - tier colour - coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange , yellow and blue			1
photos of the city of @entity156 in the north - western province of @entity143 show the thick orange haze coating the city 's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance			2
a local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas			0
in december a small town in @entity84 , @entity85 , experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude			1
clouds of dirt engulfed the town of @entity176 , in @entity84 's south - west , bringing with it a thick , dusty night for more than 90 minutes			0
the @entity178 has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year			1
this week @entity180 , @entity125 , @entity181 and @entity182 experienced severe dust storms and last week the @entity184 was hit by a sandstorm the size of the @entity187 and in february raging sandstorms engulfed @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 causing the worst @entity189 air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the @entity195			1
the sandstorm hit @entity192 after unusually warm and sunny weather for a february day , and the sky over downtown @entity199 turned yellow and blotted out the sun , limiting visibility hazy : the @entity192 capital was transformed by the sandstorm while @entity204 and nearby @entity204 ports were closed because of the weather red alert : the sandstorm in @entity192 gave the country a @entity210 look the storm , made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the @entity76 in @entity97 also engulfed @entity199			1
@entity189 's @entity214 said air pollution levels were the country 's worst in five years			0
the sandstorm that engulfed the @entity184 , meanwhile , wrecked havoc across the area , causing traffic accidents , the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents			0
images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across @entity125 , @entity228 and the @entity126 and reaching as far east as @entity130 and @entity129 over a period of seven days			2
it began on april 1 , when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern @entity125 before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the @entity187 , @entity230 reported			0
along the way it caused chaos across the area 's major cities including @entity241 and @entity242 , where some locations were reduced to zero visibility , streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut			0
the @entity249 said : ' the blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations , disrupting ground transportation , air traffic , and also closing schools			0
dr @entity256 , director of the @entity257 in @entity258 , @entity259 , told @entity260 that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally , population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them			2
he said : ‘ we are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring , mainly from satellites , and forecast systems , in the last five to 10 years , and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions , in recent decades , increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes			2
’ he added : ‘ our longest dust records over the @entity282 , downwind from the @entity76 desert , which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes , but we do n't really see positive trends			0
’ severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in @entity192 's capital city ' visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at @entity291 , which is one of the world ’s busiest in terms of volume of flights			0
' more than 450 @entity299 flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier 's 1,526 scheduled flights , the @entity297 reported			0
on top of this , 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in @entity307 , @entity241 and @entity308			0
dr @entity256 , director of the @entity257 in @entity258 , @entity259 , told @entity260 that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally , population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them			0

’ a @entity334 study said : ' approximately half of the dust in today 's atmosphere may be the result of changes to the environment caused by human activity , including agriculture , overgrazing , and the cutting down of forests			1

footage showed an unusual ' apocalyptic ' dust storm hitting @entity13
@entity14 has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year
half of dust in atmosphere today is *due* to human activity , said @entity334
