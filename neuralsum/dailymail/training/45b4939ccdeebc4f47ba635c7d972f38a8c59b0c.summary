click here for your ultimate stats package from the game ... a bad night for football , an even worse one for @entity6			1
@entity6 just can not get to grips with the @entity8 , its unique mental demands and its relentless rhythms			2
at half - time @entity12 ’s team were seemingly back on course after poor results in their opening two games			1
they had played beautifully at times and led comfortably after goals from @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity20 gives @entity6 the lead on the half - hour mark to put his side ahead against @entity25 @entity6 frontman @entity20 celebrates with strike partner @entity26 having given @entity12 's side the lead @entity21 slides in at the back post to double @entity6 's lead against the @entity32 side during tuesday 's @entity34 encounter @entity6 players gather to congratulate goalscorer @entity21 ( second left ) while @entity25 goalkeeper @entity36 looks down @entity38 striker @entity37 edges ahead of @entity39 to poke the ball home to halve @entity6 's advantage @entity37 takes a tumble under the challenge of @entity39 in full view of cheering ball boys as @entity38 find the back of the net captain @entity49 is helped to his feet by @entity51 as @entity52 moves to the kick - off spot with the ball after scoring @entity55 dives to his left but is unable to keep out @entity58 's late penalty after @entity59 brought down @entity37 in the area @entity59 was adjudged to have brought down @entity25 frontman @entity52 in the area with just minutes of the game remaining video lack of concentration cost us - @entity12 @entity25 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity36 6 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 6 , a @entity68 6 ( @entity37 45 , 7 ) , @entity71 6.5 ( @entity72 68 , 6 ) @entity73 6.5 , @entity74 6 , @entity75 6 , @entity76 7			1

scorers : @entity20 29 , 38 booked : @entity86 referee : @entity98 5 @entity99 : @entity21 by the end , however , @entity6 were staring at a disappointingly early end to their @entity8 season yet again			1
as peculiar as it is to say , the current @entity103 champions continue to stand still in @entity104			0
this was a pretty grim experience all told in @entity107			0
freezing temperatures , a stadium echoing to the boorish , boozed - up chanting of @entity25 fans who should n’t have been anywhere near the place and a late penalty decision so dreadful it ’s tempting to check the @entity118 referee ’s passport for @entity32 lineage			1
@entity25 are a dreadful club			2
ignorant to the behavioural problems that afflict them and their supporters , they were contemptible and contemptuous all at the same time			0
officials brushed aside suggestions that @entity25 fans had been given access to the main stand and attempted to blame @entity128			2
as they left the room , they were applauded by their own media			0
the @entity132 here will be a hoot , wo n’t it ? all of this will irritate @entity6 , of course			2
it will be a frosty boardroom at the @entity138 when the teams reconvene next month			0
last season , the @entity25 party turned up in jeans			1
here , some of @entity6 ’s most prominent officials – including their chairman and chief executive – did n’t even attend			2
what will bug @entity12 and his players most , however , is the result and their second half performance			2
@entity12 summed it up best when he said afterwards that he hoped people would see performances of @entity157 standard from his team as they go after the three wins they will need to qualify between now and mid-december			1
certainly , what @entity6 continue to serve up in @entity104 is unrecognisable from the football they routinely play domestically			2
they were so superior in the first half that they should have been out of sight			0
by the end , though , they were hanging on for a point			0
the two sides played out the match in front of an empty stadium after @entity25 's fans were banned for racist chanting @entity6 right back @entity39 shoots with his left foot as @entity25 defender @entity176 attempts to block the ball @entity25 midfielder @entity74 grimaces as he loses a boot during the clash against the @entity157 champions and so to the good part			1
@entity25 began the night well and were briefly lively in front of @entity55 ’s goal			1
a long shot from @entity76 had @entity55 scrambling early on before former @entity185 winger @entity71 cut inside to curl a left foot shot wide with @entity55 once again in some trouble			0
certainly there was enough there early on to cause @entity6 some concern and twice in the opening twenty minutes captain @entity49 had to contribute vital tackles , once to stop @entity71 and then to thwart @entity76 after a heavy touch from the striker			1
slowly , though , @entity6 took hold of the game and twice they could have taken the lead before they actually did score as @entity39 and @entity21 volleyed wide of either post from tight angles after good balls from the impressive @entity85			1
when @entity6 did score , it was a super goal			1
@entity89 split the @entity25 defence with a through ball to @entity26 and the @entity209 waited for @entity20 to arrive to his right before slipping the ball to his partner for his eleventh goal in as many games this season			1
coming in the 29th minute , the goal served to settle @entity6 down and suck a little of the life out of the @entity32			1
at least for the time being			0
as such it was no surprise that @entity6 scored again before half - time			1
again it was another lovely team goal and this time @entity20 played his part in its creation , volleying the ball across goal for @entity21 to score from a yard after @entity39 had headed a @entity85 diagonal ball down in to his path			1
@entity21 jumps over the challenge of @entity72 as the @entity25 man wins possession back for his side @entity85 's heat map shows the @entity234 covered a huge amount of ground for @entity6 - click here to see more there was still time for @entity6 to strike the post – @entity21 again – before the interval and @entity12 ’s team went in at the break knowing they were halfway to getting themselves right back in to the group			1
after that , though , it all went wrong			0
@entity25 played a part in their own revival			2
their coach @entity249 changed his formation and threw on @entity37 , who was to be influential			2
nevertheless , it was @entity6 who lost their tempo , @entity6 who lost their momentum and their pace of play			2
as a result , it was @entity6 who began to experience danger where previously there really had n’t been any			2
the turning point arrived with 25 minutes left			0
city gave the ball away cheaply , central defender @entity84 left flat - footed by a ball inside his right shoulder and when @entity268 crossed low @entity55 and @entity49 were left on their backsides as @entity37 bundled the ball in from six yards			1
it was a blow but it need n’t have been fatal			0
briefly they rallied and regained some authority but still they gave the ball away and when the defining moment arrived at the death they played their own part in it			0
certainly it was a shocking decision by @entity281			0
to suggest @entity282 impeded @entity37 was preposterous			0
if anything , the foul was by the attacker			0
but @entity12 will have noticed that @entity85 initially surrendered possession with a cheap back heel in his own half and by the time @entity58 despatched the penalty the @entity6 coach was buttoning up his coat in anticipation of some tough questions			1
@entity12 did n’t discuss the referee but his silence on the matter spoke volumes			0
in terms of his team he knows the script			0
they are not good enough			0
a bad night , indeed			0
@entity6 midfielder @entity86 , signed from @entity303 in the summer , makes a forward run as @entity25 frontman @entity76 watches on @entity306 , @entity90 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity307 attempt to keep warm under blankets whilst sat on the bench @entity6 left back @entity59 attempts an effort inside the area as @entity25 defender @entity312 looks to block the shot on goal midfielder @entity85 begins a marauding run from his own half past @entity73 as @entity49 and substitute @entity86 look on			1

@entity12 's hopes of *progressing* to the next round look slim after *conceding* late penalty to @entity25
@entity20 gave @entity6 the lead on 28 minutes with his eleventh goal of the season in as many games
@entity21 extended the @entity157 champions ' advantage nine minutes later
@entity25 @entity37 bundled the ball into the back of the net to give @entity32 hope
@entity58 scored from the spot to equalise after @entity59 was adjudged to have fouled @entity52
