by @entity1 reporter published : 12:25 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 02:48 est , 31 december 2012 paralympians and politicians have accused the honours system of favouring able - bodied athletes over their disabled teammates			0
equestrian star @entity7 has led criticism , saying he was ‘ disappointed ’ not to be getting a knighthood after winning his tenth @entity11 gold medal this summer			1
other @entity11 vented their frustration and a former sports minister said the honours committee had made a ‘ big mistake ’ in not giving them more recognition			0
paralympian @entity18 won more golds than sir @entity20 and sir @entity21 put together yet missed out on a knighthood @entity7 , who was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita , a rare disorder which means limbs do not develop properly , was awarded a @entity26 in 2009 , after winning three golds in three consecutive games , but missed out on the top award in last week ’s announcement			1
he said : ‘ it ’s the discrepancy that p * * * * * me off			0
obviously , ten golds , one silver and one bronze just is n’t enough			2
‘ i ’m disappointed because i do feel i ’ve given a lot to @entity11 sport and equestrianism			0
i think ten gold medals is quite an achievement			0
’ he said : ‘ you can understand how @entity7 feels			1
i ’ve won five gold medals but only got an mbe			0
now there are athletes who have got a cbe after winning just one gold in 2012			2
’ it comes after @entity48 winner @entity20 and sailor @entity21 , who each have four gold medals , were given the top award of knighthoods			1
sir @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) have both been knighted paralympian dame @entity52 ( left ) was knighted only this year after winning 11 gold medals , eight silver and three bronzes since 1992 , compared to @entity56 ( right ) who was knighted after two golds paralympian @entity58 wonders whether they are overlooked because they are not in the public eye the only paralympian to get the top honour in the new year honours list was @entity52 , who will be made a @entity65 after winning 11 gold medals in swimming and cycling			1
yesterday , @entity70 mp and former sports minister @entity71 said it was a ‘ big mistake ’ not to have recognised more @entity11 athletes , such as wheelchair athlete @entity58 , who has six gold medals			2
mr @entity71 said : ‘ there was an opportunity to be consistent and if you look at his record over several @entity80 i think the least he should have got is a knighthood			2
because the whole purpose of the @entity28 was to inspire a generation – and how better to inspire a generation of @entity11 than to give somebody a knighthood ? ’ meanwhile , @entity11 sprint gold medallist @entity88 , who was awarded an mbe , wrote on social networking site @entity89 : ‘ has to be said though , how much more does [ @entity58 ] have to do to get a knighting ? ! ’ the 2013 list was drawn up by the @entity93 , which was chaired by @entity94 and included former @entity95			1
@entity96 said : ‘ i do n’t think you can compare the @entity80 and @entity11			0
‘ the honours system is the fairest it ’s ever been in terms of the number of @entity11 winning awards			0
