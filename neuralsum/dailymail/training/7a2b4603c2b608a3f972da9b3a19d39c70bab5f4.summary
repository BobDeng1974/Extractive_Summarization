@entity0 has confirmed that her first kiss with husband @entity0 took place on the @entity4 roof and insists that the memorable moment was much more innocent than the world wants it to be			1
speaking to the today show earlier this morning , the 33 - year - old mother - of - one took the opportunity to clarify exactly what she meant when she told tv host @entity12 that she may have engaged in ' a little hanky panky ' on the roof when she was younger			1
' ok , first i have to say i was shocked by the question , ' she told the today team			2
' but my husband and i did have our first kiss on the @entity4 roof			1
' i want to say two things , ' she said during the phone interview			0
' first of all , it is not the @entity38 thing that people want it to be			0
it was pretty innocent but really lovely and now , you know , 10 years later , here we are with a child , so it 's a pretty special thing			2
' and then second of all , i think i single - handedly brought back the words hanky panky			0
' eager to try and glean as much information as possible from a slightly embarrassed @entity0 , today show hosts @entity52 and @entity53 immediately pressed for her to describe the romantic scene in a bit more detail			1
' i just want to know if the snipers on the roof of the @entity4 gave you any privacy , ' @entity52 , 41 , asked			2
' well , i mean , maybe there was no privacy , ' @entity0 admitted			1
' there probably was no privacy , but in our minds we were the only two people there			0
' all grown up : these days , she is happily married to @entity0 , with whom she has a one - year - old daughter named @entity70 what a laugh : @entity0 ( r ) appeared on the show alongside tv chef @entity73 and both of the ladies spent much of the episode in hysterics never one to skirt around an issue , co-host @entity53 , jumped in to ask : ' but you did cross into canoodling ? ' much to the shock of his fellow presenters			1
' no , there was no canoodling thank you , ' @entity0 said			2
' there was not heavy petting , there was nothing			0
' on wednesday night , @entity0 appeared on @entity12 's @entity89 , where the tv host questioned whether or not she had ever ' fooled around ' in the @entity4			1
at first , @entity0 remained coy , telling the audience : ' am i blushing ? listen , a lady never talks ! ' but eventually , she confessed : ' maybe there was a little kiss on the roof			1
' @entity0 implied that the lucky man on that fateful night was her husband - to - be , explaining : ' i was 19 years old when my dad became president ... meaning i knew [ my husband ] for a long time			1
tell - all : @entity12 also asked if she ever romped around in the @entity103 bedroom			0
' no , no , ' she said , before conceding jokingly : ' maybe i missed an opportunity there ' family values : @entity0 ( r ) is the younger of former president @entity28 's twin daughters ' and you know , maybe there was a little hanky panky			1
there was maybe a kiss on the roof , ' she revealed with a sly smile			0
the today show correspondent , who met her husband during father @entity28 's 2004 campaign , was also asked if she ever romped around in the @entity103 bedroom			1
' no , no , ' she said , before conceding jokingly : ' maybe i missed an opportunity there			0
' @entity0 , who welcomed daughter @entity70 in april 2013 , also talked about being ' fiercely protective ' of @entity121 and @entity122 , who were recently criticized by a @entity124 aide for not showing enough ' class '			2
' it 's not easy , and it 's not a job that they wanted			0
and so it 's hard ! ' said @entity0			2
' i mean i , obviously , heh , had a hard time			0
but it 's also a privilege			0
so i mean ... they 've done an incredible job			0
