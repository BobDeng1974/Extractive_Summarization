a limited - edition watch designed to work in ‘ outer space ’ has been released by a @entity3 company			1
there are 50 units of the @entity7 watch being made , and its design is based on a spaceship piloted by fictional character @entity11 from a 1970s cartoon			2
@entity14 , t although it might boast an interesting design , space and watch enthusiasts alike might baulk at the asking price of £ 150,000 ( $ 230,000 )			1
the @entity23 ' @entity7 ' ( @entity24 6 ) is designed to operate in outer space			1
each of the four corners is a 360 ° sphere tapped at the top and bottom with sapphire crystal domes @entity32 : @entity33 ( @entity34 5 ) titanium dimensions : 1.95 x 2.06 x 0.8 inches ( 49.5 x 52.3 x 20.4 mm ) number of components : 80 water resistance : 100 feet ( 30 metres ) features : two spheres at the front of the watch display the hours and minutes , while two twin spherical turbines at the back regulate the winding system to reduce stress and wear			0
a sppecialised tourbillon timekeeping ' cage ' , found at the centre of the watch , ensures it works in zero - gravity			1
the entire watch is made of 475 individual components , 80 of which make up the case			2
it is also embedded with 68 jewels			0
the watch , created by @entity58 from @entity3 watchmaker @entity21 and @entity59 , has five distinct segments			1
it uses a technique known as tourbillon to make it able to counter the effects of gravity			2
this means it can be used even in a weightless environment , such as on board the @entity71 of course , astronauts on the @entity71 are n’t in zero - gravity , but their constant state of freefall towards @entity76 allows them to float around the station			1
the @entity79 watch mounts the timekeeping element , namely the balance wheel , inside a rotating cage			1
this means that , if it were to be used on the @entity71 , the cage would constantly move in order to keep the time on the watch accurate			2
on the watch , the central sphere , which keeps track of the time , is capped at the top and bottom by transparent sapphire - crystal domes , as are the other four domes			0
the central portion of the watch also has a retractable dome that can protect the timekeeping elements from ultraviolet radiation - for those moments when the wearer has n’t got the benefit of @entity76 ’s atmosphere for protection			2
two spherical segments at the front then rotate to display the hours and minutes			0
two spheres at the front of the watch display the hours and minutes , while two twin spherical turbines at the back ( seen at the bottom of the watch here ) regulate the winding system to reduce stress and wear the interior workings of the @entity79 watch are shown on the left , including the semi-spheres that show the time , and keep the watch working			0
it is based on a comic released in the 1940s called @entity11 ( shown right ) , which was later adapted into a cartoon for tv in the 1970s on the back , two twin spherical turbines spin to regulate the winding system , reducing stress and wear on the device			0
the entire watch is made of 475 individual components , 80 of which make up the case			0
it is also embedded with 68 jewels			0
‘ space is an extremely hostile environment , ’ the company said in a statement			0
‘ to survive you need protection against powerful accelerations , dangerous thermonuclear radiation , extreme temperature fluctuations and constant risk of unexpected collisions			0
’ at the centre of the watch is the tourbillon ( shown left ) , a rotating timekeeping element in a cage that moves depending on how the watch is orientated , meaning it can work even in zero - gravity			1
a radiation shield ( shown right ) can cover this element to protect it from uv rays			1

@entity3 watchmaker @entity21 has *revealed* a *product* that works in outer space
the @entity163 has a *specialised* tourbillon timekeeping element
found at the centre of the watch , this cage ensures it works in zero - gravity
it also has a radiation ' shield ' that protects the element against uv rays
only 50 of the watches are being made and cost £ 150,000 ( $ 230,000 ) each
