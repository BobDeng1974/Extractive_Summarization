yesterday , @entity3 apologised ' for any distress and embarrassment caused ' ' the @entity3 decided at that time that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction but that no charges should be brought as a prosecution would not be in the public interest			1
' the @entity3 made a statement in october 2013 , explaining its decision not to prosecute mr @entity2			1
' following a complaint made by mr @entity2 , the @entity3 carried out a review of this decision and it has concluded that it had been wrong to determine that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction			1
' the @entity3 has apologised to mr @entity2 for any distress and embarrassment that its wrong decision and public statement in october 2013 caused			1
' the cps of course accepts that mr @entity2 committed no offence			2

' we had to endure the ordeal of interviews under criminal caution because of the allegations			0
' we have endured endless delays while the various authorities kept us completely in the dark as to what was going on			0
' i have been through six or seven appeal processes , all of which dismissed my assertions that i had done nothing wrong			0
' it was only when , at my own expense , i instructed lawyers to challenge the @entity3 that they caved in and admitted that they had been wrong all along			2
' i have been able finally to achieve a just outcome for myself only because of my knowledge and experience of the system			0
' i have grave doubts that an ordinary citizen who has not had such a background would have been able to successfully challenge wrongdoing by the authorities without access to potentially expensive litigation			0
' this is not the way our justice system should work			0
' i shall endeavour to ensure that lessons are learned from what has been , for us , a most upsetting experience			0
