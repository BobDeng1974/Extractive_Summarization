they have identified 52 products – including teething gels and painkillers designed for babies as young as two months – which contain additives linked to hyperactivity			1

the e number medicines : there are 52 remedies that make children hyperactive , campaigners claim but the ‘ @entity28 ’ additives – six artificial colours and one preservative – still appear in medicines aimed at youngsters			2
@entity6 , for example , gets its distinctive pink shade from carmoisine ( @entity33 )			2
now health campaigners at @entity35 are calling for the use of the additives in medicines to be outlawed			0
co-ordinator @entity39 said : ‘ some of our most trusted children ’s medicines contain unnecessary colourings that have been linked to hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders			1
‘ manufacturers should follow the example of the food and drinks industry and remove these colourings from children ’s medicines			1
’ the suspect colours are tartrazine ( @entity52 ) ; quinoline yellow ( @entity55 ) ; sunset yellow ( @entity57 ) ; carmoisine ( @entity33 ) ; ponceau @entity58 ( @entity59 ) ; and allura red ( @entity53 )			0
the seventh additive is the preservative sodium benzoate ( @entity63 )			0
the campaign group ’s study , released today , reports that four of the six e numbers were found in 19 children ’s medicines , including @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and some prescription drugs			1
food colourings linked to hyperactivity should be banned from children 's medicines , the charity action of @entity75 has warned the @entity6 product is designed for babies as young as two months , the @entity71 product for those three months and up and the @entity72 for teething babies			1

@entity93 , professor of bio-imaging at @entity95 and an expert on child brain development , backed the call for a ban , while public health nutritionist dr @entity100 urged manufacturers to remove the additives from medicines ‘ as a matter of urgency ’			0
currently , under @entity108 law synthetic colourings are banned from food and drinks targeted specifically at children under 36 months			0
separately , @entity113 ’s @entity112 has successfully put pressure on manufacturers to remove the artificial colours identified in the @entity28 research from food for older children			2
but there is no law stopping their use in medicines			0
action on additives said 19 children 's medicines sold in the @entity113 contain colourings linked to hyperactivity industry watchdog the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) says it is encouraging firms to remove the colours from medicines but has no legal powers to go further			1
action on additives said it is time for a legal ban on use of the e numbers both in food and in medicine			0
it is calling on parents to protest directly to the manufacturers and the @entity130 to demand action			2
@entity147 , which makes @entity6 , confirmed it contains carmoisine and sodium benzoate , but said both had been approved by the @entity130 and insisted there was ‘ no evidence to suggest additives … are associated with hyperactivity when present in children ’s medicines ’			1
it added : ‘ the consumption of food and drink is very different to the consumption of medicines			0
over-the - counter medicines are only intended for occasional use in small quantities over a very short period of time			2
’ it argued the colours are important because they allow patients and healthcare professionals to identify a medicine on sight			0
@entity171 , which makes @entity72 , said it complied with @entity130 and @entity173 guidelines .			0

action on additives said 19 children ’s medicines sold in the @entity113 - including @entity6 *infant* *suspension* - contain colourings linked to hyperactivity
the @entity130 and @entity182 said the medicines are intended to be taken *infrequently* so additive intake from them is low
the charity is worried about *chronically* ill children who need regular doses
