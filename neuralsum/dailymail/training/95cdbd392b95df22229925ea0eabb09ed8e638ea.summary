' he also said he is praying for the two accused			2
' i have to pray for these boys			0
i have to pray for them to become good men			0
that 's the hardest thing for me to do			0
but it 's something i have to do			0
that 's what 's hard			0
if you want to know the truth that 's the hardest thing to do , ' he told the @entity101			1
' i have absolutely no faith in the @entity104 or the @entity106 city police or the crown prosecutors because they totally dropped this case , they totally dropped the ball			0

' we 're just hopeful there 's charges laid and others to arrest , hoping that they 're finally willing to tell their side of the story , ' @entity154 , @entity11 's mother , said			1
innocence : @entity11 is pictured as a baby with her parents , @entity154 and @entity166 distraught : @entity11 's mother chokes back tears at the teenager 's funeral in april after she hanged herself ' a sense of relief came over me that at least they 're going to be questioned			1

' when @entity11 was born , i promised her the world			2
now my beautiful girl is gone , ' @entity154 said			0
