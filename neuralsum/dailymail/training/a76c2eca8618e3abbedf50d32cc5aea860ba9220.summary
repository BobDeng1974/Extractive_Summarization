two - thirds of @entity1 can not say anything in a foreign language – with one fifth even unsure of what ‘ bonjour ’ means , a study claims			1
the findings appear to confirm the cliche about @entity1 being notoriously bad at making an effort to speak the lingo when abroad			2
overall , 64 per cent of those polled admitted they did not know a single word in any language other than @entity16			0
tongue - tied : reasons for not trying to speak a local language included not being bothered , fear of making a mistake or expecting hosts to be able to speak @entity16 and just one third – 34 per cent – said they were willing to make an attempt at speaking a foreign language while on holiday			2
one fifth ( 19 per cent ) did not know the meaning of the @entity30 word for hello , one of the most recognisable foreign greetings in the world			0
and 63 per cent had no idea what the @entity36 word ‘ goedemorgen ’ meant , despite the obvious similarities to our own ‘ good morning ’			1
young @entity1 were found to be worst at making the effort , with nearly half – 47 per cent – of those aged 16 to 24 admitting they have never spoken the foreign language they learned at school			0
' @entity47 por favor ' : unsurprisingly is one of the few phrases @entity1 people seem to understand but 45 per cent of the over- 55s said they liked to try to speak the local language when abroad , the poll of 2,000 adults by travel website @entity51 found			1
it is compulsory for all pupils to study a foreign language up to the age of 14 and @entity30 , @entity61 and @entity62 are all on the national curriculum			0
yet only one in ten of those polled considered themselves able to speak one of them			0
of these , a quarter could ask only ‘ everyday questions ’ , 21 per cent said they were limited to ‘ hello ’ and ‘ goodbye ’ , and one in 50 claimed they could understand everything said to them in another language , but were unable to reply			1
the phrases they did take the trouble to learn were somewhat revealing of priorities			0
almost half – 43 per cent – knew ‘ una cerveza por favor ’ meant ‘ a beer please ’ in @entity77			1
reasons for not trying to speak a local language included not being bothered , fear of making a mistake or expecting hosts to be able to speak @entity16			0
@entity51 spokesman @entity85 said : ‘ brits often have a negative image abroad when it comes to languages , and it does n’t seem to be anything we ’ll be saying auf wiedersehen to any time soon			2
’ for those doing the ' @entity95 ' @entity94 , per favore @entity96 , bitte @entity97 , s'il vous plait @entity100 cerveza , por favor for those doing the ‘ @entity103 ’ @entity104 , prosím ( @entity106 - vo , pro-seem ) @entity107 piwo , proszę ( @entity108 - no peev , proshe ) @entity110 õlu , palun ( @entity112 ur - loo , pah - lun ) @entity115 viena alaus ( @entity114 - shau vie - na , al - lows )			1

a fifth do *n't* even know what ' bonjour ' means
revealingly , of those that can speak languages almost half knew ‘ una cerveza por favor ’ meant ‘ a beer please ’ in @entity77
