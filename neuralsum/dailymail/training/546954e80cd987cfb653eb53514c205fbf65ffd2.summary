by @entity0 a series of controversial adverts about pancreatic cancer have been cleared of being offensive , despite 121 people complaining about them			1
the adverts saw pancreatic cancer sufferers say ‘ i wish i had breast cancer ’ or ‘ i wish i had testicular cancer ’			1
the string of adverts , which were shown on tv , online , on posters and in newspapers , showed three people suffering from the cancer , including @entity15 , whose image was accompanied by the words ' i wish i had breast cancer '			2
the @entity19 has cleared a @entity21 campaign of offensiveness			2
the adverts saw patients ( such as @entity15 , pictured ) saying they wished they had other cancers the idea of the campaign was to highlight the disease 's terrible survival rates			1
ms @entity15 , who was diagnosed with the disease in april 2013 , died on february 22 this year at the age of just 24			0
the image of her used in the campaign by @entity21 showed her with no hair and a series of tumours on her head			0
the adverts stated : ‘ today , 23 people will be told they have pancreatic cancer			2
‘ like @entity15 , this is what they face : only three per cent will survive because of late diagnosis ; most will die within four to six months ; it ’s the @entity45 's fifth biggest cancer killer			0
‘ pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of all 22 common cancers			1
’ ms @entity15 , who married fiance @entity51 just days before her death , received death threats online after appearing in the advert , but said she had ' no regrets ' about appearing in the campaign as she wanted to raise awareness about the cancer			1
the aim of the campaign was to raise awareness of the extremely low pancreatic cancer survival rates			1
@entity15 ( pictured with her husband , @entity62 ) died of the disease in february the advertisement caused so much controversy that 121 people complained about it to the @entity67 ( @entity19 )			2
however , the organisation has refused to ban the advert			0
the complainants , some of whom were cancer patients , said the adverts , which also showed a man saying he wished he had testicular cancer and a woman saying she wished she had cervical cancer , implied that other types of cancer were ' not serious or difficult to deal with '			1
the complainants said they felt that this was ' offensive and distressing '			0
the @entity19 , however , did not ban the ads , saying : ‘ the @entity19 noted that the headline claims in the ads that seemed to compare different types of cancer were likely to be shocking and could potentially be upsetting , particularly for people who had experience of those types of cancer			0
‘ however , we understood that the quotations reflected the genuine views of people who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and noted that the text directly below the headline claims clarified what was meant by those claims			2
ms @entity15 said she did not regret appearing in the advertisement as having breast cancer would have meant she had hope which did not exist for her as a pancreatic cancer patient ‘ this text made clear that due to low early diagnosis and a lack of awareness of the symptoms of the disease , pancreatic cancer had the lowest survival rate of all common cancers and therefore the chances of survival with any other type of cancer were likely to be greater			1
‘ we considered that this put the quotes referring to other types of cancer into context and that , when considered as a whole , the ads were unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence or unjustifiable distress , and therefore the ads did not breach the @entity124			0
’ @entity21 ( @entity21 ) said the campaign aimed to provide an insight to the general public into how it feels to be diagnosed with a disease that leaves you ' with no hope '			0
it said it had ' never suggested that the suffering of a pancreatic cancer patient was worse than that of breast , testicular or cervical cancer patients ' and that ads were not offensive			1
@entity21 said the ads ' contained the facts ' and explained ' why someone might want another cancer ' and ' that pancreatic cancer had the lowest survival rate of all 22 common cancers '			1
it said the decision to run the adverts was ' not taken lightly ' and that of 2,000 people polled before the adverts appeared , only six per cent said they were ' angry ' about them			0
@entity150 ( about 50,000 patients diagnosed each year in the @entity45 ) 1 year survival - 95.8 per cent5 year survival - 85.1 per cent figures are only for women10 year survival - 77 per @entity156 ( around 2,200 men diagnosed each year ) 1 year survival - 98 per cent5 year survival - 97.2 per cent10 year survival - 96 per @entity162 ( 8,000 - 8,500 patients diagnosed each year in the @entity45 ) 1 year survival - 17.4 per cent of men and 19.1 per cent of women5 year survival - 3.6 per cent of men and 3.8 per cent of women10 year survival - 2.9 per cent of men and 2.7 per cent of @entity169 : @entity170			0

the campaign was *launched* by @entity21 in february
it featured genuine pancreatic cancer sufferers saying ' i wish i had breast cancer ' , ' i wish i had testicular cancer ' and ' i wish i had cervical cancer '
the aim was to raise awareness of terrible pancreatic cancer survival rates
the campaign caused outrage as some thought it *belittled* other cancers
the @entity67 has decided not to ban it
