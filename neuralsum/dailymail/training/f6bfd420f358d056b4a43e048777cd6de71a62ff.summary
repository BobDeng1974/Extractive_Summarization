by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 7:44 am on 23rd december 2011 the @entity3 detector - one of the @entity5 's two huge particle detectors - captured a particle that physicists had suspected to exist for years , but had never seen ' in the wild '			1
the @entity11 ( @entity10 ) particle was detected among data from the trillions of collisions at the @entity5			1
the discovery was hailed as testimony to how effectively physicists were now scanning the collision data - and essential background to the @entity5 's ongoing quest for the @entity21 , a theoretical particle which is thought to ' explain ' why the universe has mass. the @entity3 particle detector made the @entity5 's first confirmed sighting of an entirely new particle earlier this year - a subatomic particle that will help physicists fill in crucial details in their quest for ' new physics ' and the @entity21 physicists scan the data from the @entity5 's detectors for ' unusual ' signals from the debris of high - energy collisions			1
this new particle is an important milestone for the collider - and a crucial step in its mission to fill in the gaps in our understanding of physics			2
professor @entity48 , a particle physicist at the @entity49 said the @entity21 ' will always be the @entity50 ' , but that this discovery is still very exciting			1
what 's been discovered , he explained , is a particle comprised of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark - an entirely new kid on the sub-atomic block that until now was merely a theory			0
he told @entity59 : ' it 's exciting confirmation of the theory of strong interactions that keeps these particles together , the same theory that describes how a nucleus sticks together			0
' what they 've found is a b - quark and an anti b - quark			0
' quarks can not be seen by themselves , they 're contained in a particle and held together with the strong force			0
if you understand how the force works , you can predict which particles should exist			0
' with all these different quarks you can play @entity79 and put them together in different ways and form new particles , similar to protons , that can be combined to form elements			0
' the @entity5 : the machine hurls particles at one another at enormous energies to see what odd particles emerge from the ' debris ' - but this is the first time it has detected an all - new particle the results were put online on the scientific publication site @entity95			2
the find is an important step for the @entity5 - which is more than a machine built solely to hunt for the @entity21			1
finding particles such as @entity11 ( @entity10 ) is crucial to filling in the gaps in the @entity101 - the way we understand physics			2
the @entity5 was designed to fill in these gaps - and help physicists ' move on ' to the @entity21 and ' new physics ' .			1

first confirmed find at the @entity5 since it *opened* in 2009
crucial background to help physicists hunt for @entity21
helps physicists understand why atoms hold together
