@entity0 of @entity1 was as elegant as ever today in a claret @entity4 coat while meeting military supporters , servicemen and women , as part of @entity8			1
however , the glossy mane that inspired a million @entity11 blow - dries looked rather different : silver roots were clearly visible along the parting of her normally chestnut hair			1
she 's also gone for a less bouncy ' do than usual , parted in the middle , rather than at the side			0
in fact , the flat , middle - parted style she 's chosen highlights the silvery strands coming through at her hairline			0
hairdresser @entity25 comments : ' if you are going grey , it is important to part your hair where the grey does not show			0
' rebelling : however , professor @entity31 said the @entity0 occasionally rebels against her public image - as can be seen in this photograph taken last year , which shows streaks of grey in @entity38 's usually immaculate tresses			1
however , it appears @entity38 does n't care who spots the silvers			2
and why should she ? she 's probably got more important things on her mind			0
many new mothers , like @entity38 , find that their hair changes after they give birth			1
greying hair is not normally directly associated with pregnancy , however , any form of stress can encourage it and can be a side effect of being pregnant or giving birth			1
' if , when pregnant , you use an anaesthetic grey hairs may develop			0
it ’s a huge shock to the system sometimes sends the hair bulb to sleep causing the hair to loose its natural pigmentation , ' explains @entity61 ' in my experience many pregnant women whose hair turns grey will start seeing their natural pigmentation come through within a few months			1
' sources say that the @entity70 had , to her horror , started finding the odd grey hair ( ‘ stress highlights ’ , her friends joke ) before her pregnancy however , it seems more likely that @entity38 's has been getting lighter for the last few years - common among those with dark hair - and has simply decided not to cover it up			1
indeed , impeccably placed sources have whispered that the @entity70 had , to her then horror , started finding the odd stray grey ( ‘ stress highlights ’ , her friends joke ) before her pregnancy			2
to combat these , she had organic vegetable - based dye and subtle low - lights applied during regular four - hour visits to the @entity90 in @entity11			0
evidently , @entity38 has let these sessions slip - not many new mothers , even royal ones , can spare four hours at the salon when they 've got a four - month - old to look after			1
' going grey marks nature ’s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes , ' says @entity61 ' i always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide , to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly			0
' however , @entity38 may want to avoid any unnecessary chemicals : it could be that she 's being very cautious about dying her hair while pregnant or breastfeeding			1
many women stop colouring their hair during pregnancy , with some waiting until at least 12 weeks after the birth of their baby to begin again			1
this is for fear of the chemicals used in many dyes being passed to the baby through breast - feeding			2
this time last year , pictured above , @entity38 's hair was noticeably darker , and parted at the side however , the @entity124 says new mothers need n't avoid the salon : ' the chemicals in permanent and semi-permanent hair dyes are not highly toxic			1
most research , although limited , shows that it ’s safe to colour your hair while pregnant			2
' some studies have found that very high doses of the chemicals in hair dyes may cause harm			0
however , these doses are massive compared to the very low amount of chemicals a woman is exposed to when colouring her hair			0
' celebrity hair stylist @entity141 said : ' i recommend vegetable dye and colour glosses to my clients when they 're expecting			0
they 're safe and take them through those months with a gentle solution to keeping roots at bay			0
' @entity38 looked radiant in a calf - length red coat from @entity4 as she met former and serving soldiers at @entity153 today @entity0 of @entity1 prepares to meet staff and volunteers from the @entity157 's @entity156 the @entity70 and @entity38 travelled from @entity153 palace to @entity153 this morning @entity38 wore an outfit which matched the colours of the @entity162 poppies : her claret coat is from @entity4 's autumn / winter 2011 collection often , women find their hair looks thicker and shinier during pregnancy but hormonal changes kick in after having a baby , as dermatologist @entity170 explains			1
' hair has three phases ; growth , resting and shedding , ' she says			0
' normally , hair grows at the same rate that it falls out			0
but under the influence of pregnancy hormones , more hairs remain in the growing phase , particularly during the second and third trimester , which is why women often notice hair becoming thicker as their pregnancy goes on			2
' usually , losing your hair after birth is just your hair going back to normal			0
