for all the moves before 11pm , click here @entity3 's gazumping of neighbours @entity4 for @entity5 will see the odds on their top - four finish fall , much like the torn - out pages of @entity10 's big black tactics folder as he gets to work on his his new 3 - 2 - 5 formation			1
while it is n't the solid - foundation defensive player that everyone outside of @entity17 's mission control believes @entity3 need , this signing is a goals guarantee and it also deals a blow to both @entity21 and @entity22 , for whom @entity5 's prolific scoring profile would have been perfect			1
one of the key reasons @entity26 stepped back from signing him – and he has been on a plate for them all summer – is that it was understood he would eat into the goals tally of both @entity33 and @entity34 , not to mention replace the president 's favourite @entity35			1
he would not have been running away from goal to vacate space for @entity33 to fill , he would have been heading straight for the edge of the six - yard box where he has scored so many of his goals for @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
he scored 52 times in just 67 games for @entity66 in @entity67 and nine in 13 in @entity70 qualifiers for @entity41 before injury kept him out of the tournament			0
he may not lead the line like @entity74 , he may not have the variety of goals that @entity77 has , the long - distance shooting of @entity33 , the work - rate and sacrifice of @entity81 , the elegant touch of @entity83 or the presence of @entity85 but as a straight up and down finisher @entity5 is second to none			1
' i watch the @entity89 a lot , ' he told @entity91 last season , ' i like how competitive it is and how teams who are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition 's goal as quickly as possible			1
the football goes back and forth and that makes it a fascinating league			0
' pedigree : the striker has scored goals wherever he has played , including 52 league goals in 68 games poacher : inside the box there are few better than the @entity110 who is one of the world 's best finishers injury worry ? @entity5 missed out on the @entity70 with @entity41 but insists he can remain at the top level click here to read about the move and click here for more of @entity5 's movements that desire to be part of the attack - orientated @entity89 is born of an inherent ability to see the space before any defender , run into it , and finish first time with maximum power and accuracy and the minimum fuss			1
he will thrive on the early balls into the area that @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 ( if he survives the latest tactical readjustments ) can provide			0
@entity5 was also at pains to make it clear that the physical side of @entity140 football would not be a problem in spite of his injury record			2
' the @entity52 league is also very physical			0
the players are very physical and all the teams are			0
technically the top two might be ahead of the rest but physically all the teams are very strong , ' he said			0
@entity3 will be more than aware of the cruciate ligament tear in his right knee sustained at the end of 2013 but the decision of @entity41 coach @entity157 not to take the 28 - year - old to @entity159 and hope that he reached full fitness before the end of the tournament will help what is now his comeback season			2
predator : @entity5 heads straight to the six - yard box and will guarantee goals for whoever signs him short stay : @entity5 's @entity171 switch was always seen as a year out , and now it appears he has made his move loan star : the forward will join @entity3 on a season - long loan on a £ 200,000 - a - week deal injury or no injury the feeling last season was that @entity5 was taking a year out			1
the decision to go to @entity171 always looked short - term			2
even the @entity184 side seemed to have resigned themselves to losing him despite being back in the @entity185 , hence their apparent willingness to let him move away			0
a fan of the @entity110 side @entity188 where @entity190 played , @entity5 wants to go back and play for his local club one day before he finishes in the game			2
first though , he says : ' i want to play in the @entity140 league a some time in my career			0
' i hope to be playing for many more years yet in @entity196			0
' now after the pains of watching the @entity70 from a distance , his time to make the move has come			0
life 's a beach : @entity5 spent the summer on holiday after injury prevented him playing in @entity159 ambition : the striker will be without @entity185 football again after choosing @entity3 over @entity4 @entity209 completes dramatic @entity211 move			1

@entity213 and @entity4 were also interested in @entity171 striker
@entity5 will bring a guarantee of goals to @entity211
it may not be the signing many feel @entity3 need , but there is no doubt @entity5 can thrive in the @entity89
@entity26 opted against the striker because he is a finisher , not an *unselfish* *supplier* of goals like @entity35
@entity26 also did n't want him to eat into the goals of @entity33
