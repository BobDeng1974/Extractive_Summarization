women should not drink any alcohol while they are pregnant because of the risks to their unborn child , an mp said today			1
@entity5 wants it to be made compulsory for all alcoholic beverages to carry compulsory warning labels directed at expectant mothers			1
the @entity10 mp for @entity11 on @entity12 presented his @entity13 during this morning 's session of @entity15 , after @entity16			1
mr @entity5 told @entity17 that 7,000 children a year were born in the @entity19 damaged by alcohol , equating to one in every 100 births			1
he said : ' mild brain damage can be caused to children by even small amounts of alcohol at the wrong time during pregnancy , especially in the early stages when an embryo does not have the protection of a blood stream			2
' much scientific evidence suggests that there is no safe limit when it comes to drinking in pregnancy but sadly not everyone is aware of the dangers			1
' mp @entity5 presented his @entity13 in @entity15 today , urging pregnant women to stop drinking in a bid to protect their unborn babies from @entity44 syndrome he said at least one in 100 babies are born damaged because of the effects of alcohol ' this is a vitally important issue , ' he said ahead of introducing his bill today			1
' everything possible needs to be done to bring this to an end , and mps in @entity15 have the power to take steps to do just that			1
' there has been confusion for pregnant women over whether they should or should n't drink during pregnancy			1
' there has been confusion over how much they can drink			2
' the best advice is it is better to be safe than sorry			1
if you 're pregnant do n't drink			1
' but there is still some ambiguity from the government on this			2
' he told @entity17 : ' my @entity5 is about making sure that all the facts are available and about avoiding confusing or conflicting advice , whether from government or elsewhere			1
' the labels in place now are inadequate , that is why i am calling for a mandatory system of labelling that is clear , that can not be easily missed and that gives the best advice			1
' that advice must be not to drink at all while pregnant or trying to conceive			1
' such a system of labelling should be designed to help cut the number of children damaged at great cost to themselves and to society			2
' mr @entity5 's drive to protect unborn children from the effects of alcohol was inspired by his wife @entity93			1
she learned of the devastating effects of @entity95 ( @entity95 ) when attending a meeting on the subject as part of her role on @entity100			2
babies born with @entity95 are prone to suffering learning difficulties , memory problems , hyperactivity and poor problem - solving skills			2
those diagnosed with @entity107 ( @entity107 ) are also known to suffer birth defects , including a smaller head circumference , heart problems , limb damage , kidney damage , damage to the brain , eye problems , hearing problems and specific facial characteristics			2
mr @entity5 said he wants to see all alcoholic drinks carry clear health warnings directed at expectant mothers , warning them alcohol can harm their unborn child mr @entity5 said : ' at the severe end of the spectrum , there are 7,000 live births of children with more severe @entity107 each year , with three or four times as many babies being born with more moderate damage but still suffering from @entity95 in the @entity19			1
' there is however , suggestion of under diagnosis as symptoms are similar to those resulting from conditions such as @entity137			2
' across @entity139 and @entity140 , estimates suggest that at least one in 100 children suffer from the effects of drinking during pregnancy and some experts say the true figure may be as high as three or four in every 100			2
drinking while pregnant increases the risk of your unborn baby suffering @entity107 ( @entity107 ) and @entity95 ( @entity95 )			1
when a pregnant women drinks alcohol it travels across the placenta to the foetus via the bloodstream			1
because the foetus 's liver is n't fully formed , it is unable to metabolise the alcohol quickly enough			0
at this stage a baby has a high blood alcohol concentration			0
it therefore lacks oxygen and the nutrients needed for its brain and organs to grow properly			0
timing also plays a factor			0
a baby 's facial features are formed during weeks six to nine of pregnancy			0
mothers who drink during this three - week window are therefore more likely to have babies with the facial deformities associated with @entity107 , professor @entity180 , an @entity182 - based neonatologist said			1
damage to a baby 's organs through drinking is most likely to happen in the first three months			0
children with @entity107 have distinct features , including small and narrow eyes , a small head , a smooth area between the nose and lips and a thin upper lip			0
they may show symptoms of : @entity95 is the umbrella term used to describe the conditions that occur in people who are diagnosed with some , if not all , of the symptoms of foetal alcohol syndrome			0
experts estimate one child in 100 is born with @entity95			0
it can be more difficult for a specialist to diagnose @entity95 , because children may not have the same facial deformities as those diagnosed with @entity107			0
children with @entity95 may suffer : dr @entity209 who works for @entity210 and @entity211 , said : ' if you drink a low amount when you are pregnant your baby has a low risk of developing @entity107 or @entity95			1
if you drink heavily you have a high risk			0
if you do n't drink , there 's no risk at all			0
' source : @entity221 ' something needs to be done to stop this			0
' there are simple steps that we as a country can take to make sure that this issue is tackled			0
' basic steps which are already being taken in other countries , such as @entity231 and @entity232 where @entity95 is taken more seriously than it is here			0
' the government needs to give concise ' no drinking while pregnant ' advice			1
' we need to introduce a programme of awareness , starting in schools			0
and we need compulsory health warning labels on alcoholic drinks as part of a wider campaign of awareness			1
' @entity19 needs to catch up			0
we need to take @entity95 seriously			0
' and we need to do everything we can to cut the often devastating effects that drinking alcohol when pregnant can have on an unborn baby 's life for years to come			1
' in the @entity251 bottles and cans containing alcoholic drinks feature a clear health warning			2
but in the @entity19 there is a voluntary system			0
in 2007 he said , @entity257 introduced a @entity258 in the @entity259 which led to a voluntary system of labelling in the @entity19 , but despite this , not all alcohol containers had a warning and questions remained over the effectiveness of the labels			0
many suppliers carry warnings on their alcoholic drinks , but mr @entity5 argues they are so small they are not immediately obvious to the consumer			1
mr @entity5 urged the drinks industry to consider the current content of labels and make the changes without legislation and called on the government to update its guidance and support his @entity280			1
the @entity281 currently advises pregnant women ' to avoid alcohol altogether '			1
it adds that if a pregnant woman does opt to have a drink , it recommends sticking to one or two - the equivalent of one small glass of wine - once or twice a week to minimise the risk to the baby			2
@entity292 echoes that advice , recommending women ' abstain from alcohol completely during the first three months of pregnancy because of the risks of miscarriage '			1
the @entity300 says the safest option for women is not to drink alcohol at all during pregnancy			2
but it adds that small amounts of alcohol have not been found to be harmful			0
mr @entity5 told @entity17 : ' the chief medical officer says women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should avoid alcohol altogether , however if they do choose to drink , to minimise the risk for the baby we recommend they should not drink more than one or two units , once or twice a week and should not get drunk			1
' she goes on to say there is uncertainty about how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy			2
' @entity318 also says that if a low level is consumed there is no evidence of harm to an unborn baby			0
however this is a view that is not universally shared			0
' the effects on a child he said could range from reduced intellectual ability and attention deficit disorder to heart problems and premature death			0
he added : ' many children experience serious behavioural and social difficulties that will last a lifetime			0
in fact what most of us take for granted is a lifelong struggle and the damage caused can not be reversed			0
' now not everyone whose mother drinks during pregnancy suffers damage that affects their life chances and this is certainly not an attack on women			2
' but the damage done by alcohol to too many children shows the need for action and it shows that too many of us do not understand the potential risks of drinking alcohol at any point during pregnancy			0
' mr @entity5 's @entity362 ( @entity363 ) @entity5 would establish a statutory scheme providing for clear and consistent labelling of alcoholic beverages as they related to foetal health and safety and that of pregnant women			1
the @entity280 , which had cross party support , was earmarked for a second reading on march 6 but is unlikely to become law due to a lack of parliamentary time .			0

mp @entity5 presented his @entity13 in @entity15 following @entity16 today
he said all alcoholic beverages should carry warnings for pregnant women
said the best advice for expectant mothers is ' better be safe than sorry '
