@entity0 kicked off the biggest week of their season in style by beating @entity3 2 - 0 thanks to a @entity5 double that took him past @entity8 as @entity10 ’s top scorer this season			1
@entity0 play @entity12 on wednesday , just four days before the decisive @entity13 against @entity14 at the @entity15 next sunday , and @entity5 led them to victory with his 31st and 32nd goals of the season			1
he even scored a goal he had never scored before in @entity10 – a header direct from a corner			0
@entity5 wheels away in celebration of his first half penalty , which put @entity0 into a 1 - 0 lead the @entity0 star scored his 16th and 17th @entity10 goals of 2015 as his side strolled to victory at the start of the year @entity8 collected the @entity30 and sent an ‘ i ’m coming for you ’ message to @entity5 who has one more @entity33 than the @entity34			1
but instead it has been @entity5 pursuing , catching and over-taking @entity8 in scoring stakes in @entity37			0
the @entity14 striker was 12 goals clear of @entity5 but the @entity0 number 10 has scored 17 goals in 10 games since the turn of the year and is now in top spot like his team			1
this was the first time @entity3 had played @entity0 in @entity37 ’s top flight – it is with the @entity50 club that the contrasts are most stark			1
they have 5,250 supporters crammed into the league ’s smallest ground while @entity0 ’s 99,000 capacity @entity15 is @entity10 ’s largest			0
@entity0 ’s budget runs to € 540m euros , @entity3 ’s is € 16m ; @entity0 make € 140m from their television deal , @entity3 make € 14m ; @entity0 ’s sponsor @entity59 pays them € 35m a year while the minnows are paid € 130,000 by a local steel company			1
on the pitch there are massive differences too			0
and the home team came into the game having scored 34 goals – six fewer than @entity5			2
although it was the @entity71 who got the opening goal @entity0 had to suffer for the breakthrough			2
@entity74 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) join @entity5 in celebration of his 31st minute spot - kick they almost scored with their first attack when first @entity5 and then @entity75 went close after @entity80 and @entity81 had combined down the left			1
but with a relatively inexperienced midfield trio of @entity84 between , @entity85 and @entity86 , and faced with a five - man @entity3 defence , the first half hour was heavy going			2
@entity88 had decided not to risk @entity89 who was a booking away from missing next week ’s @entity13 but his presence in a midfield already missing the injured @entity93 was keenly felt at times as the leaders failed to control the game			0
@entity5 left five @entity3 players behind with one dribble that started inside his own half but the move broke down as soon as he played in a team - mate and @entity3 remained on level terms			1
resistance was finally broken on the half hour when @entity80 went on a driving run into the area and released @entity5			2
@entity74 skips past the challenge of @entity3 's @entity106 during the @entity10 clash his shot cannoned off a defender and hit the arm of @entity3 defender @entity106			2
the referee pointed to the spot and although keeper @entity113 dived the right way @entity5 ’s penalty beat him			0
the goal sent him one goal past @entity8 in the top scorer list in @entity37			0
it ’s been an incredible turnaround since the @entity14 striker raced to a 12 goal advantage over his nemesis earlier in the campaign			0
@entity74 might have doubled @entity0 ’s lead but @entity5 ’s cross from the byline was cleared before it reached the @entity128 and @entity3 made it to the break just the one goal down			1
@entity5 was at his very best at times and made a sensational 70 - yard run during the first half @entity5 set up @entity0 ’s first chance of the second period when he slipped @entity74 through in the six - yard box only for team - mate to try and fail to nutmeg the goalkeeper			1
having failed to create the second he scored it , and with the most unusual of @entity5 goals			0
@entity75 took a corner from the right and @entity5 found space 10 yards out			0
his header down skidded off the turf and past a defender on the line to make it 2 - 0			1
there was time for 35 - year - old @entity152 to come and make his 750th appearance for @entity0 as the visitors saw out the remaining minutes			0
@entity155 hit the bar but @entity0 took the points to mean they stay top a week ahead of the @entity13 and four days ahead of the visit of @entity159 .			0

@entity5 scored twice to help @entity0 earn 2 - 0 victory against @entity3
@entity5 gave @entity88 's side lead with first half penalty
@entity71 star doubled @entity0 's lead with 55th minute header
