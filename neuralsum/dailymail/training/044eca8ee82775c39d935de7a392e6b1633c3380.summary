by @entity0 published : 03:32 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 03:53 est , 9 june 2012 furious sports fans hit out at the @entity3 ticket sales process once again yesterday , as event bosses were slammed for trying to flog some for as much as £ 2,012			1
thousands were trying for their last chance to gain entrance to some of the most popular @entity3 events as the latest tranche of tickets went on sale at 11am yesterday morning			1
but almost as soon as the tickets went on sale , hundreds were already taking to @entity15 to broadcast their frustration at the online buying process			1
wishful thinking ? this artist 's impression shows how the @entity21 should look in full swing , but @entity23 was facing the prospect that some stadiums may not be full as the public tires of the ticket buying process and the @entity3 organising committee ( @entity23 ) is also coming under pressure to explain its failure to shift ' prestige ' tickets , on sale for prices ranging between £ 295 to £ 1,800			1
the tickets that went on sale yesterday , ' @entity37 ' tickets for the opening ceremony cost £ 2,012 , and the cheapest available for that event were £ 995			2
many were still unsold by 5pm			0
so far , 7million of the total 8.8million @entity3 tickets have been shifted , and about half of the 2.45million @entity44 tickets , in a process that began last year			1
left out : former decathlete @entity46 has been unable to get any tickets for the games at all @entity23 still has about 550,000 tickets to sell with just weeks to go to the start of the @entity21 on july 27			1
a large chunk of them are so - called contingency tickets which had been held back while logistics such as tv camera positions were resolved			2
the committee has a further 1.25million soccer tickets to shift - about half the original number			1
yesterday , as the latest tranche of tickets were made available at 11am , hundreds of people took to @entity15 to vent their fury			2
even @entity3 legend @entity46 told how he had failed to get any tickets and had ' wasted 45 minutes ' on the @entity3 website			1
angry buyers told how they waited for the online system to tell them whether they had secured their chosen tickets only to be told that there were no more available			2
former olympic gold medal winning decathlete @entity46 tweeted : ' i bet i ’m not alone in being unable to get any tickets on 2012 website wasted 45mins and i want them so badly ' and @entity76 and @entity78 radio presenter @entity77 tweeted : ' i ’m trying to get some tickets for the @entity3 but when i click ‘ request tickets ’ on the site , it just refreshes page and tells me nothing ? ' and @entity15 used @entity84 wrote : ' appear to have more chance of winning lottery tonight than getting @entity3 tickets ! ' @entity89 presenter @entity88 said : ' i ’m in the virtual queue for # @entity3 tickets			1
3 min wait to see if i ’ve been successful			0
the official ticket website is a joke			0
' been trying to buy @entity3 tickets for 35 mins			1
nothing available for under £ 450 each apparently … gutted			0
' @entity96 wrote : ' what a rubbish system , impossible to find available tickets for any event			2
' and furious fans also yesterday hit out at the expensive ' prestige tickets ' on offer			1
@entity103 , 40 , from @entity104 , told @entity105 : ' we were told it was going to be the games for the people			0
but i did n’t realise they were talking about people with big wallets and cash to burn			0
' premium : tickets to see athletes like @entity117 compete in athletics events are among the most expensive available @entity3 organisers say the high prices help to subsidise the cheap tickets on offer to the public			1
@entity124 was given about 80,000 @entity3 and @entity126 tickets to sell			1
a @entity128 spokesman said : ' the income from these programmes provides a vital source of revenue that makes the @entity21 more accessible			0
' tickets for the @entity134 would not be available to the public at £ 20.12 if there were not tickets at £ 2,012 that subsidise the cheaper ones			0
' experts believe @entity23 has done a good job , having already sold more than 90 percent of its tickets ( excluding the football )			0
it is on target to raise the £ 500million needed towards its £ 2billion budget			0
' they have a few hundred thousand tickets which millions of people would like to buy , then they have several millions of tickets that nobody wants to buy , ' said @entity153 of the @entity154			0
' and they have a commitment to make every event a sell - out			0
' the lottery - style process adopted in the early rounds allowed it to get the best price for the tickets , he said			2
' the problem is that the @entity166 public did n't seem to understand this , ' he added			0
alternatives , such as an auction , would have raised more revenue , but would have been resented even more by a @entity166 public that had already forked out £ 9.3 pounds towards getting the @entity21 ready .			0

tickets still on sale for prestige events as fans are put off by *sky* - high prices
games organisers still have 550,000 tickets to shift
