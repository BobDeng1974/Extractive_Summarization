@entity0 is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team - mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career			1
sitting in an air - conditioned room away from the dry heat of the @entity9 paddock , he goes so far as to say this of @entity11 : ‘ i know exactly how he is functioning			1
i understand him really , really well			2
i can tell why he is doing whatever he is doing			2
’ go on , then , tell us what it is that gets under your skin			2
@entity11 waves after qualifying on pole position for the @entity24 on saturday @entity11 's @entity25 team - mate @entity0 was third six - tenths of a second behind @entity11 @entity11 has dominated @entity27 this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign ‘ i do n’t want to give details , ’ says @entity0 , diplomatic to the core			1
at this point the door of the @entity25 hospitality area , in which @entity0 and i are sitting alone , opens fast and loudly			1
it is @entity11 invading the quiet of the interview			1
he turns to face the door he has just walked through and slammed shut , his head down , and shouts in an almost childlike way : ‘ phew , phew , man , it ’s hot , ’ deporting himself as if he is about to pass out from heat stroke			2
‘ you see ... ? ’ says @entity0 , his eyebrows arched			1
the daunting task he faces against his extraordinary team - mate was made vividly clear under the lights in qualifying for sunday ’s @entity24			1
not only will he start behind @entity11 for the fourth consecutive race but behind the @entity55 of @entity56 , who is emerging as a putative title contender			1
@entity60 's corner @entity61 the 1982 world champion attended pre-season testing with friends but rarely goes to races and does not give interviews			1
@entity0 said he got his father ’s advice before the last race in @entity70 but he generally gives his son space			1
@entity72 @entity0 ’s long - term girlfriend turned wife			1
she attends a few races , sometimes with a clutch of their long - standing friends , but is happy in the background			2
she works as an interior designer			2
@entity81 a popular , mild - mannered former @entity83 sports journalist , who is @entity0 ’s pr and man friday			1
@entity86 @entity0 ’s race engineer			1
his attachment to @entity0 is such that he moved from @entity89 to @entity25 at the driver ’s request			1
@entity93 's corner @entity11 father is rarely seen at races since being dropped as @entity11 ’s manager but he is still the family patriarch			1
he established the business side of his son ’s career and still controls elements of it			2
@entity102 the @entity25 chairman is strictly neutral but has a vested interest in @entity11 being successful , having brought him to the team after telling the board he was the driver who could win them the title			1
@entity110 @entity11 ’s new travelling companion			1
a music producer , he looks after @entity11 ’s social media output			1
@entity114 @entity11 ’s race engineer			1
he did the same job for @entity117			2
@entity0 ’s deficit to @entity93 was six - tenths of a second on saturday			1
he is also separated from the @entity120 by 17 points			2
but even more separates them as people			2
@entity0 grew up the son of privilege			1
his father , @entity61 , was 1982 world champion			1
he was brought up in @entity127			2
he attended a smart international school there			2
but his life is the quiet life			2
not for him the @entity93 whirl of red carpets and celebrity acquaintances in @entity135			0
he is not tattooed from chest to leg			0
while @entity11 courts fame , @entity0 ’s dream evening finishes with him and wife , @entity140 , staying in to watch an ‘ educational documentary ’ , their yellow @entity142 , @entity144 , at their side			1
he has known @entity140 , an interior designer , since his teenage years			1
they make smoothies or ‘ healthy ’ pancakes when they home in @entity127 or @entity151			0
they gather fresh vegetables from their bio-garden			0
he relishes a bike ride to the beach for lunch			0
he loves his classic car — a light blue @entity159 , as perfect as the day it was made in 1970			0
he bought it without @entity140 knowing , but they both enjoy it now			1
he drives them through the sweeping mountain roads of southern @entity166			0
@entity0 has a trait rare among modern @entity169 drivers : a hinterland			1
he turned down a place at @entity172 to become a full - time racing driver			0
if he wins the @entity174 this year he will do so with a book under his arm			0
he is the driver who never stops learning			0
having married last year , he and @entity140 are expecting their first child in august , during the sport ’s summer break			1
‘ typical @entity183 precision , ’ he jokes			0
‘ i ’m very excited and very lucky , ’ he says			0
‘ i just hope it all goes well			0
there is a link between your personal life and your racing life , naturally			2
’ but we know he is a nice , intelligent chap , more settled in life than his rival			1
the point when it comes to winning the most prestigious title in motor racing is whether he has the capacity — the skill and cutting edge — to beat such an extravagant talent as @entity11 , who eclipsed him last year			1
@entity0 has failed to match @entity11 this season , raising the question whether he will go the way of @entity204 , who fell away after making his @entity205 team - mate @entity56 fight him for his first title			1
@entity0 ’s deficit to @entity93 was six - tenths of a second in qualifying on saturday @entity210 will start his 100th race for @entity212 from last on the grid after his ailing machine again gave up on him during qualifying			1
it was the third time this weekend he had suffered a failure , the latest coming just four corners into his first lap. ‘ it was a power cut , ’ said @entity210			0
‘ i do n’t know where it came from			0
' it is @entity0 who begins work with his engineers earlier and finishes later — and always turns up on time , unlike @entity93 — but genius sometimes makes its own rules			1
raw talent is outstripping endeavour			0
as a barbecue was staged in a paddock here on friday , he toiled in engineering meetings while the rest of us tucked in			0
he arrived after a brief stop in @entity238 , relaxing and training , before heading to the track to face an inquisition			0
why had he criticised @entity11 for slowing down seven days ago in @entity242 and thus imperilling @entity25 ’ one - two finish ? @entity0 answered in a relaxed and courteous manner			1
‘ only today have there been millions of questions , ’ he tells me once the wider interrogation was over			0
‘ other than that i ’ve had some distance from it all			0
i do n’t think about it in terms of me getting under his skin or him getting under mine			0
for both of us it has been annoying to spend so much time on the topic			0
@entity11 and @entity0 pose together during their unveiling as @entity25 ' new team in february 2013 ‘ @entity11 and i are going through a difficult period			1
we can not totally be friends			0
we go through ups and downs			0
we are only speaking when we need to but sometimes we have a laugh together			0
we have so much to do with each other			0
i am not an ice man , either			0
things can get to me but i do not get angry			0
you wo n’t catch me getting very emotional			0
’ the feud between the two has been running for a year , each upsetting the other in turn , a situation magnified because there has been nobody else with whom to scrap			0
if @entity55 seriously push their way into the championship contest , that might change somewhat			1
‘ there are so many experiences that i can build on , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ even now when he has taken quite a few points off me and been on a winning streak , i think back to last year when i had my best run after he had won four in a row			0
@entity0 's father @entity61 ( left ) was also a famous racing driver and won the 1982 @entity169 ‘ i like to push myself			1
i am not at my peak as a driver , though i am probably close to it			0
but i have the experience of how to set up the car and deal with the whole world of @entity169			2
the intra-team stuff , personal relations are helped by last year			0
’ @entity0 was born 29 years ago in @entity300 , @entity183 to a @entity183 mother , @entity302 , and his famous @entity304 father			1
he soon moved to @entity127 and developed as @entity306 polyglot			0
his solid family background is the bedrock of his life			2
@entity11 said last year that @entity0 was not as hungry as him because of their different backgrounds , the former being from a council estate in @entity313 and the latter from a plutocrat ’s playground			1
fair ? ‘ i had it easy if you think of people who have money struggles in their lives			0
people reading this may think i had it easy			0
but i had my personal battles			0
even making it to @entity169 was not easy ; it was a constant challenge and commitment			0
my whole life has taken a lot of sacrifice			2
‘ some people say i am not strong enough to beat @entity11 but i have as much belief as ever			2
i only would n’t believe i could beat him if i got to the end of the championship and i had lost			0
that is not what i want to happen and i am constantly learning to make sure it ’s not what happens			0
’ @entity55 's @entity56 pipped @entity0 to second in qualifying on saturday			1
