at least not at the time			0
the high - drama duo stole away to @entity18 , where they continue to live as a couple , where the baby was presumably conceived			2
while @entity7 seemed extremely relieved when his gal pal 's test came back negative , he told @entity49 's @entity48 that he felt the opposite when he met his bouncing baby girl			1
' it 's really a blessing , ' he said			0
' it 's one of the greatest creations one could ever hope to be apart of ! ' in fact , it was the scare itself that showed @entity7 just how much having a baby with @entity12 would mean to him			1

her family , who live in this large but well - worn @entity20 home , were especially happy and visited the baby the day it was born rags to riches ? the millionaire former politician met @entity12 ' family , who live two miles out a dirt road , not long after her original pregnancy scare faithful : a recent episode of @entity4 introduced viewers to @entity12 's faithful family , including her grandmother ( center ) and mother and father welcome to the family ! the grandmother 's advice when she learned of @entity12 ' relationship with a rich older man : start taking pre-natal vitamins ' i 'm getting on in my age and i wanted a child , ' he said			1

it airs april 21 at 10/9c			0
fertile for ground for drama : @entity12 and @entity7 have a knack for having fun both separately and together			1
here , the recent episode that showed the couple in a doctor 's office as they anxiously awaited @entity12 ' pregnancy test results meanwhile , and despite not actually being a main cast member , @entity12 ' presence on the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama , intrigue and southern seduction			1
when the local celebutante , political scion and model was hauled into @entity149 jail for underage drinking and disorderly conduct in 2012 , authorities snapped the sexy mugshot of the century			1
for fans wondering how @entity12 gets to join the soapy series ' main cast members in their drunken antics : the 5 - foot - 11 redhead turned 21 by the time she showed up to heighten the show 's already impossibly high drama			1
new parents : @entity7 once served months in prison on felony cocaine charges and recently pleaded guilty to a dui			1
@entity12 has had some issues with the law , herself			2
this 2012 mugshot was snapped after she was hauled in for underage alcohol possession and disorderly conduct @entity12 may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate developer turned @entity173 , even with the 30 - year age gap			1
like @entity12 , @entity175 also has a history of booze - fueled lawbreaking			1
he pleaded guilty just last march to driving drunk while summering in @entity178 , @entity179 last july			0
the former @entity181 presidential campaign chairman had his license suspended for six months and was fined $ 1,400 , according to the @entity183			0
while clearly a lot of fun while apart , @entity7 and @entity12 know how to have a good time while together , as well			2
not the father : another @entity188 cast member , self - proclaimed rascally raconteur @entity38 was also worried he was the father of @entity12 ' baby , but she was n't actually pregnant at the time like gentlemen : in an encounter unrelated to the pregnancy , @entity7 invited fellow cast member @entity194 to ' take it outside , ' where he accused the show 's resident southern dandy of sleeping with @entity12 dramatic turn : @entity12 and @entity7 's romance has also created a stir outside the various love triangles talking trash : the pair drew snickers and sideways glances upon their arrival at a friend 's party @entity7 : the once and future @entity20 political power player ? @entity7 @entity7 , who 's 48 according to his @entity49 bio but 51 if you prefer to believe news outlets such as the @entity214 , was once a major up - and - coming force in @entity20 politics			1
the millionaire former real estate developer held the state - wide elected office of @entity20 treasurer and had served as chairman for @entity181 's presidential campaign in the state before he was brought down hard in a cocaine scandal			1

he was sentenced in 2008 to 10 months after his felony conviction			1
and what about now ? besides the @entity13 gig , or perhaps because of it , @entity7 is reportedly eying a dive back into politics			2
the @entity233 ex-con told @entity234 early this month that he likely intends to run for @entity235			2
' and should the current @entity237 senator @entity236 be the nominee , i ’m going to throw my hat into the ring as a candidate because i think the voters need the opportunity to have a choice , ' he said on @entity245			0
@entity8 @entity8 : @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 @entity8 raised the eyebrows of @entity29 , @entity20 's garden - partying elite when she dropped onto the scene as @entity7 's girlfriend , but it 's not her first lap around the disgraced politician dating pool			1
the 22 - year - old was once involved with @entity258 , a former state representative who resigned his office in disgrace in 2012 after he was arrested for harassing an ex-girlfriend			2
her politico predilections may stem from her background as the daughter of two prominent political families			0
