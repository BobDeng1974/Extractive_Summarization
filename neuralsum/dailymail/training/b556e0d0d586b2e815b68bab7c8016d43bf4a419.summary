@entity41 , the seafront manager for @entity42 , said : ' the thing about longboards is they tend to have straps on			2

' even in the skate park they must wear helmets and knee and elbow pads			2
' it 's like climbing rocks without ropes on			2
his parents must be devastated			0
' mr @entity41 said land surfing was not allowed on the museum 's private car park area			0
he added : ' land surfing is relatively new and there are no by - laws against that particular activity			0
' the carpark is not the highway - it 's private land so it would n't be permitted			0
' we would ask our community wardens to talk to people they see doing it , not least because they can get injured and bystanders can be injured			0
' any activity of this type is dangerous and users can be involved in a serious accident as has sadly happened in this case			0

' joining a club and practising runs within their limits , while still learning the basics , are the key ways to avoid injury and improve quickly			0
' finding an appropriate location to take part and choosing the right safety kit , including a helmet and wrist guards - particularly if you are beginner - is also advised			1
