' a conviction based on conjecture can not stand , ' he said			0
mr @entity30 also argued that prosecutors failed to show that @entity15 , 41 , had lethal amounts of cyanide in her blood , citing disagreement among expert witnesses as to whether she died of the poison or a sudden heart dysrhythmia			2
