by @entity0 a convicted thug who conned an 87 - year - old widow out of £ 15,000 in savings for building work he never did is serving just eight days in jail			1
@entity6 and accomplice @entity7 received credit for pleading guilty , despite being involved in a car chase to flee police and denying being the men who duped the pensioner when they were caught			1
@entity6 , 22 , who already had convictions for theft , criminal damage and harassment , will be freed tomorrow			1
jailed : @entity6 , left , and @entity7 , right , will spend just eight days and two weeks in prison respectively after admitting involvement in a £ 14,600 scam			1
their victim has been forced to leave her home @entity7 , 18 , who had a conviction for assault , will walk free next week after just a fortnight in jail			1
last night , mrs @entity28 ’s son @entity27 said the sentence was no deterrent because their crime was so lucrative			1
he added : ‘ the fact they got more than £ 7,000 each for a few weeks in jail means it pays better than a job			1
i certainly do n’t earn a wage that high , it pays better than any job i know			0
’ and campaigners said : ‘ @entity42 justice has been put in the dock and found guilty of complete failure			2
’ @entity45 heard that @entity6 and @entity7 , who both live in caravan parks , targeted the grandmother last september , spending a week convincing her to pay for unnecessary roof repairs			1
they persuaded the retired teacher to go to her bank and withdraw £ 4,800 , then returned the following day to collect a further £ 9,800 from her			1
but mrs @entity28 told her 49 - year - old son about the visits and he immediately contacted police			1
he also called his mother ’s bank to put a stop on the joint account he shared with her , so that when the conmen returned the following day for another £ 7,800 , she was unable to withdraw it			2
victim : @entity28 , left , has moved to a retirement home after the incident , according to son @entity27 , right he said : ‘ @entity65 thought i had sent some workers to do some jobs for her , but i did n’t know anything about it			1
‘ when i checked how much was missing from her account i could n’t believe my eyes			0
they took thousands and just kept coming back for more each time			0
’ police placed a secret camera in bushes at the front of mrs @entity28 ’s home , which recorded @entity7 walking up the drive on september 27			1
sentence : judge @entity81 described the pair 's crime as ' extremely offensive ' and said they knew what they were doing was dishonest three days later officers were waiting in an unmarked car as he returned to the property in upmarket @entity90 , @entity92			1
when confronted , he tried to escape in a van driven by @entity6 , but they were caught after a high - speed chase			1
despite initial denials , they eventually admitted fraud by dishonestly making false representation for their own gain			2
@entity7 , of @entity101 , @entity92 , and @entity6 , of @entity102 , were sentenced to four months in jail on january 23 , but were only locked up for a few days each because their guilty pleas and the fact that both had to wear electronic tags while awaiting trial were taken into account			1
the money they stole amounted to half the insurance payout mrs @entity28 received when her husband @entity114 died aged 84 last year			2
her son said : ‘ when the police searched the homes of the two men , they could n’t find any trace of the money			2
she wo n’t see a penny of that ever again			0
’ mr @entity124 added that although their punishment was short - lived , the ordeal would affect his independent mother for the rest of her life			2
after she was duped , he was so fearful that she might be exploited again that he moved her out of her home of almost 40 years and into a retirement complex where she felt more protected			0
yesterday , the electronics engineer criticised the courts for failing to punish or deter the cruel conmen			0
he said : ‘ i was shaking when i found out			0
four months seems like a kick in the teeth			0
it does n’t feel like a real punishment			0
‘ they did this to an old person who has worked for the benefit of society as a teacher the whole of her working life			0
’ @entity147 , a spokesman for @entity148 , the organisation for the over- 50s , said : ‘ eight days is an insult – eight years would have been much more appropriate			0
‘ the perpetrators clearly have no shame , but @entity42 justice has been put in the dock as well and found guilty of complete failure			0
’ mrs @entity28 ’s mp , @entity156 , said : ‘ this appears derisory			2
given that this man already had a criminal record , it is a completely inadequate sentence and a failure of the justice system			0
’ the @entity163 mp said he would be raising the case with justice secretary @entity165 , who has vowed to ‘ teach criminals that they will be punished for their crime ’			0
despite a @entity170 pledge to end so - called soft sentences , new figures show barely a quarter of all criminals convicted of serious offences were jailed in 2012			0
more than 700 arsonists , 70 rapists , 1,100 people convicted of sex assaults , 2,745 fraudsters , 162 who killed by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers were among those who walked from court that year .			0

fraudsters convinced retired teacher @entity28 to hand over £ 14,600 for ' building work ' on her home in @entity92
police caught @entity6 and @entity7 at the house and the pair admitted involvement in the scam
but they will serve just eight days and two weeks of four - month sentence
were given credit for their guilty pleas and times spent on electronic tag
victim 's son says the sentence shows crime is more lucrative than work
