by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 9 april 2013 for years women have been convinced that porn star style waxing and vajazzles are the quickest way to impress their other halves in bed , with nearly two thirds saying that their look down below is calculated to please their man			2
but it appears that it 's time to wave goodbye to painful waxing for good , after a new survey found that men actually prefer a natural look			0
according to the poll , which canvassed 1,000 men , the most popular look is is ' trimmed and tidy ' – a far cry from the @entity18 , which involves having all hair removed			1
au naturel : contrary to what the majority of women believe , men prefer a natural approach to grooming nearly half ( 43 per cent ) of those who took part in the survey , which was commissioned by waxing brand , @entity34 , said they preferred their women to look as natural as possible but with a ' @entity37 ' - trimmed hair and waxed edges leaving no bikini hair overspill			1
17 per cent plumped for the @entity40 , a landing strip of pubic hair , while 15 per cent liked the heart shaped ' @entity44 '			0
just 12 per cent chose the full @entity18 , with most men saying they preferred their women to have some hair ' down there '			1
the style that men hated the most was the ' @entity51 ' – a closely trimmed small square of hair that most felt looked a bit silly and a bit of a turn off			1
among the men who took part in the poll was @entity61 father of two , @entity60 , who said : ' i ’d hate my wife not to have some hair , i much prefer her to be well trimmed than sporting some ridiculous , unsexy design			2
' ouch ! the bejewelled vajazzle was popularised by @entity66 , star of @entity68 is @entity69 others , including 27 - year - old @entity71 from @entity69 , said that they did enjoy seeing the odd @entity18 or vajazzle on their girlfriends			1
' i like it interesting - like unwrapping a present and finding a surprise , ' said @entity71			0
' i do prefer some hair so a design like the landing strip or heart shape is good for me and no surprise , vajazzling is popular in our town			2
' @entity34 ceo @entity84 said : ' pubic hair styles are fast becoming just as important as the hair on your head			0
' popular designs for women and it seems men are the landing strip , heart shape and triangle patch indicating some hair is sexier to sport than " the all - off "			1
but make sure you know what you ’re doing as once styling begins there is no turning back			0
