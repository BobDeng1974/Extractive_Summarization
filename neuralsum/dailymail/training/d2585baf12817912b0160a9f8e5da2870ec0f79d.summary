claim : @entity0 says his £ 4.99 @entity2 app is a ‘ surgery - free weight - loss solution ’ a war of words has erupted between leading obesity surgeons and celebrity hypnotist @entity8 over whether hypnotherapy weight - loss apps actually work			1
the smartphone market is flooded with downloads that promise to help users shed pounds			2
some , like @entity0 ’s , even claim to use hypnotherapy to mimic the results of drastic and costly weight - loss surgery			1
however , top surgeons have warned that , in their opinion , giving customers the impression they will see the same results as gastric - band surgery is wrong			1
the surgical procedure , which costs about £ 6,000 , involves doctors implanting an inflatable band around the top of the stomach to create a small pouch , so patients feel fuller quicker			2
@entity0 says his £ 4.99 @entity2 app is a ‘ surgery - free weight - loss solution ’ that ‘ can help convince the unconscious mind that a gastric band has been fitted , so the body behaves as though a band is physically present ’			1
but dr @entity36 , a lead physician at @entity39 ’s @entity38 ’s obesity service , dismisses these claims as ‘ a gimmick ’			2
he says : ‘ hypnosis is n’t powerful enough to be effective in the long term			2
’ consultant surgeon @entity44 , from the @entity45 in @entity46 , agrees			0
he says : ‘ it might be called a hypnotic gastric band , but is no more a physical operation than a hypnotic pacemaker or hypnotic hip replacement			0
if it worked , then why are n’t thousands of patients having it on the @entity50 ? ’ currently , patients must have a @entity57 of 40 or above , or 35 or above with a serious health condition , to meet the criteria to have weight - loss surgery on the @entity50			1
top surgeons have warned that , in their opinion , giving customers the impression they will see the same results as gastric - band surgery is wrong			1
above @entity0 's £ 4.99 @entity2 app results are proven in numerous clinical trials : patients should expect to lose a third of their excess body weight within six months , and half within two years			1
why do my eyes water when i chop onions ? professor @entity77 , director of the centre for the @entity78 at the @entity79 , says : ‘ spicy flavours like mustard and onions can irritate the trigeminal nerve in the brain , which is linked to the eyes , nose and mouth			0
when you chop onions , you release molecules into the air that get into the nose and cause a sting that irritates the trigeminal nerve			0
the nerve thinks your eyes are being attacked , so it sends a signal that makes them water to flush away the irritant			0
’ @entity50 treatments for obesity are based around a healthy diet and exercise , and in some cases medication such as @entity106 , which prevents about a third of fat from food being digested by the body			0
bariatric surgery is offered to people with potentially life - threatening obesity when other treatments have failed			2
some 6,500 weight - loss procedures were performed in 2013			1
these included fitting a gastric band , and gastric bypass – where the digestive system is rerouted to bypass most of the stomach and small intestine , meaning that patients can only eat small amounts of food			0
however , in response @entity0 says that hypnotherapy is , as a matter of scientific fact , a proven means of weight loss			1
his spokesman explains that the gastric - band hypnotherapy app is ‘ merely an innovative variation on a scientifically tried and tested means of weight loss ’			1
this includes a 1985 trial which showed 109 hypnosis patients lost significant amounts of weight , and continued to do so over a two - year period , when used alongside other ‘ behavioural ’ treatments , compared with patients who only had behavioural treatment			1
@entity50 advice is that hypnotherapy can help with problems such as irritable bowel syndrome and the pain of childbirth , but there is not enough evidence to recommend it for weight loss			1
@entity0 says that hypnotherapy is , as a matter of scientific fact , a proven means of weight loss hypnotherapist @entity155 , who has helped patients tackle their own weight issues , believes that linking a hypnotherapy product to a physical operation is ‘ a complete waste of money ’			1
he says : ‘ people are vulnerable – people are spending money on something they think will be a magic bullet			0
everyone ’s trigger is different so they need one - to - one support and you ca n’t get that through an app or cd			2
’ help could soon be at hand for those who suffer cold sores			0
studies have shown that an amino acid called lysine prevents flare - ups by inhibiting the herpes simplex virus that causes the sores , and blocking its attempts to replicate in the body			0
the richest natural sources of lysine are meat , dairy products , eggs and beans			0
a daily 1,000mg supplement should be taken as a preventative measure , but if the telltale signs are already there , taking 3,000mg a day should speed up the healing process			0
@entity196 , clinical lead for general and bariatric surgery at @entity39 ’s @entity199 , also warns that calling the app a ‘ hypnotic gastric band ’ could deter some dangerously obese patients from opting for surgery			1
he says : ‘ gastric - band surgery is a big commitment			1
it is expensive if done privately and carries some risk , even though it is a very small one			0
@entity209 might see it as scary surgery , and then they come across a “ hypnotic gastric band ” that seems to be as effective and costs a lot less			0
‘ a physical band creates a barrier to food intake and reduces the appetite by having an effect on satiety on the brain			0
mental - health approaches like hypnotherapy and psychotherapy can be beneficial , but it ’s potentially misleading to associate them with a surgical procedure			1
’ yet gp @entity226 , an expert backing @entity0 , says the app is a safer and cheaper option that should be offered to patients contemplating gastric - band surgery			2
he maintains that the term ‘ hypnotic gastric band is merely a metaphor for significant weight loss ’			2
mr @entity226 adds : ‘ if a hypnotic approach was offered to patients contemplating surgery , then this would reduce mortality and morbidity and be a considerable financial saving for the @entity50			2
’ procedure : a surgeon shows how how the centre membrain of a gastric band inflates			0
this inflation places pressure around the outside of the stomach to restrict the movement of food			0

@entity8 is calling his new app a ‘ surgery - free weight - loss solution '
claims hypnotherapy is scientifically proven method of shedding pounds
but doctors say he 's giving customers false idea of the results they *'ll* see
@entity2 app claims to convince ' unconscious mind ' that surgical implant has been fitted
