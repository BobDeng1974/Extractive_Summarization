retired taxi boss @entity9 , 67 , slumped to the floor of the double - decker bus in front of horrified passengers as he headed home from seeing his ex-wife			1

@entity9 's life was saved by @entity16 when he had a heart attack on a bus in @entity26			1
ms @entity16 performed cpr for 18 minutes until paramedics arrived in the @entity30 commercial , football hard - man @entity28 demonstrates proper heart massage technique - keeping the correct rhythm by singing the 70s classic			1
administration officer ms @entity16 , who works at @entity34 , pumped mr @entity9 ’s heart for a staggering 18 minutes until paramedics arrived - singing the words to the song as she did so			1
she was only on the 67 bus , bound from the @entity41 area of @entity26 to the city centre , by chance , because one of her children was ill so she was running late			2
the mother - of - three , 42 , was sitting in front of mr @entity9 on the bus when she noticed him fall over			1
she said : ‘ we came up to a bus stop and in the corner of my eye i saw @entity9 fall			0
‘ i thought he had just lost his balance but i turned around and he was lying with his back to me in the foot well of the seats behind			0
ms @entity16 sprang into action when she noticed mr @entity9 slump into the foot well behind her seat and start to turn blue ‘ i asked him “ are you alright ” and “ can you hear me ” but he was going quite blue and he was n’t breathing properly			1
‘ i turned him over and began feeling for his pulse , but i could n’t find one and he was getting more and more blue			0
‘ at that point i started pumping his chest , i knew how to do cpr from being in @entity69 when i was younger but it was the @entity7 that helped me keep the rhythm			0
‘ i was singing “ @entity74 ’ alive ” in my head the whole time to keep the rhythm going			0
‘ in a situation like that i think you go into auto - pilot , i was n’t aware of what was going on around me , i just knew how to do chest compressions and was singing the @entity7 to myself			2
she knew how to perform hands - only cpr in time to the @entity7 ' classic , ' @entity83 ' , because she had seen the @entity30 's advertisement featuring @entity28 ( pictured ) ‘ the whole thing lasted 18 minutes , including the time the paramedics were i know because i checked the clock			1
‘ one paramedic who was first on the scene asked me to carry on chest compressions when he arrived while he performed checks			0
‘ i even helped them carry @entity9 out of the bus			2
’ mr @entity9 , from @entity94 , had been to visit his ex-wife who he is still friends with , in @entity26 on february 25 when he collapsed on the way home			2
she sang the song out loud as she performed cpr and says that she just went into ' auto - pilot ' and was not aware of what was going on around her yesterday he was reunited with ms @entity16 , along with two paramedics who helped save his life			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t remember too much of the actual incident , everything up to getting on the bus is a bit of a blur			0
‘ but when people told me that a woman had saved my life by following the instructions in a tv advert i was stunned			0
mr @entity9 has thanked ms @entity16 , and the paramedics , for saving his life ‘ apparently she was singing along to “ @entity8 ’ alive ” as she pumped my chest			2
‘ it must have been an odd sight but it saved my life and i will always be very grateful to her			0
‘ i understand @entity16 was pumping my heart for 18 minutes - so it must have been the extended remix going around her head			1
‘ the remarkable thing is @entity16 does n’t usually get that bus , she was only on it that day because her child was ill and she was running late			0
‘ i ’m like the cat with nine lives , i feel so lucky			0
‘ i ca n’t thank her enough , i think she should sing it from the rooftops			0
’ @entity135 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity30 , said : ‘ we know hands - only @entity5 has saved lives in supermarkets , pubs and on golf courses , but this is the first time we know of that it ’s made a life - saving difference on public transport			1
‘ @entity16 did exactly the right thing and kept pushing hard and fast to the beat of “ @entity8 ’ alive ” by the @entity7 until professional help arrived			2
‘ it ’s vitally important you keep up chest compressions until paramedics get to the scene - no matter how long that might be			0
‘ @entity16 is one of more than 35 people who has given hands - only @entity5 a go and helped save a life			1
no matter where you are , it can be the difference between life and death for anyone in cardiac arrest			0
