@entity1 's pledge to strip the obese , alcoholics and junkies of their benefits if they refuse help has previously been rejected @entity1 's pledge to strip the obese , alcoholics and junkies of their benefits if they refuse help was previously rejected by the @entity7 twice after experts warned it would drive claimants to ' crime and prostitution '			1
the prime minister said yesterday that it was ' not fair ' taxpayers had to fund the welfare payments of the unhealthy and addicts who failed to undergo treatment			1
his comments come after @entity21 revealed that almost half a billion pounds is paid every year to @entity22 hooked on drugs and drink			1
a total of 46,810 alcoholics and 27,440 drug addicts were being paid £ 435 million in sickness benefit , while 1,380 obese people got £ 8.4 million in @entity29			1
mr @entity1 has ordered expert health adviser professor dame @entity30 to carry out a review of how those with treatable conditions should be helped back into work , and if they should face the threat of benefits cuts for failing to ' engage ' with treatment			2
but it can be revealed that the government has already rejected the tough regime twice after being warned it would see vulnerable people turn to the black market to feed their habits			2
the ' carrot and stick ' approach was first proposed by the previous @entity40 in 2009			0
shortly after the last election , the independent @entity47 warned that the @entity49 – to give addicts a ' treatment allowance ' instead of sickness benefits or @entity53 – would have ' negative , unintended consequences '			2
in june 2010 the @entity55 concluded that the scheme contained ' a number of significant flaws '			0
four months later , the @entity59 proposed an almost identical regime of ' sanctions ' , and once again the experts on the @entity47 rejected them – until mr @entity1 's intervention yesterday			1
but @entity64 , a former @entity65 dem minister who sat on the @entity66 , said : ' it 's being suggested again because it makes a good headline but it will be dropped for the same reasons			0
the prime minister said it was ' not fair ' that taxpayers had to fund the welfare payments of the unhealthy ' taking away someone 's money is n't going to make them get over their problem			1
we need to be better at providing treatment			0
' the @entity7 is also set tomorrow to start the roll - out of its controversial ' universal credit ' plan amid claims its welfare reforms are getting the jobless back to work more quickly			0
work and pensions secretary @entity87 will unveil plans to ensure the credit , which replaces six benefits and is being piloted in the @entity91 , will be available at all 700 @entity92 in 12 months ' time			2
but @entity40 , which has pledged to review the reform , said it was still only making ' glacial progress '			0
welfare spokesman @entity96 said : ' at the current rate , it will take 1,571 years to be rolled out			0
