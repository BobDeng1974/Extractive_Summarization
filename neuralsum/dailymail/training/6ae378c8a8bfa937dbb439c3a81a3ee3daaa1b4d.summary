yet no one disputes that he is highly dangerous and delusional			0
@entity31 himself acknowledged during his 1995 capital murder trial that he had killed @entity34 and @entity35			2
dressed as a cowboy , he acted as his own attorney , believing only an insane person could prove an insanity defense			0
