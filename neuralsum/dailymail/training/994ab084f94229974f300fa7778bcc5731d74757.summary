by @entity0 published : 14:40 est , 13 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:50 est , 13 february 2014 dna footprints left in the wake of ancient warriors can unravel long - held secrets about a country ’s past			0
now , for the first time , scientists have mapped the dna of 95 different populations to see if they can paint a clearer picture of major historical events			1
this incredible interactive maps looks at the mixing of genes in major populations in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 spanning over the last four millennia			1

blue circles indicate the local populations			1
@entity39 shows the population that this group may have mixed with			1
the size of each circle represents the sample size used by the scientists			0
@entity47 circles , indicate that there was no admixture with populations , as is the case with @entity52			2
the map reveals the genetic impact of @entity19 colonialism , the @entity57 slave trade , the @entity58 and @entity19 traders near the @entity60 mixing with people in @entity62			1
‘ we made some very surprising discoveries , ’ dr @entity63 of the @entity64 told @entity65			0
‘ for instance , the @entity69 group are an isolated population in @entity72			2
they are believed to be descendants of @entity75 's invading army , and our map does n’t dispute that fact			0
' many of the map ’s genetic observations match historical events , and provide evidence of previously unrecorded genetic mixing			2
the group with the longest time since admixture is the @entity86 from @entity72			2
they have an ancient inferred event prior to @entity89 , involving mixing between a more @entity19 and @entity91 group , and a more @entity93 group many kalash people ( left ) believe they are descended from the army of @entity75 ( right )			1
the date shown in the interactive map does not rule this out but the date range also allows for many other possibilities for example , the dna of the @entity103 people in modern @entity62 suggests that in around @entity107 , @entity19 similar to modern @entity105 mixed with an otherwise @entity62 - like population			1
plausibly , said the researchers , the source of this @entity19 - like dna might be merchants travelling the nearby @entity60			1
the powerful technique , dubbed ' @entity112 ' , also provides insight into past events such as the genetic legacy of the @entity58			0
historical records suggest that the @entity118 people of @entity72 are partially descended from @entity120 warriors , and this study found clear evidence of @entity109 entering the population during the period of the @entity58			2
six other populations , from as far west as @entity126 , showed similar evidence of genetic mixing with @entity58 around the same time			1
' what amazes me most is simply how well our technique works , ' said dr @entity63			0
the @entity135 people are a group of @entity137 living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern @entity140			2
their genetic data reveals their ancestors came from far and wide with significant local populations with @entity145 heritage this map of @entity52 was based on genetic data from 6 individuals			1
it shows that much of the admixture was with local populations in @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
a tiny per cent of @entity109 was found to come from @entity155 , but the researchers have described this as ' noise ' and not reflective of the general population an event which is easy to identify signal is the @entity120 expansion			0
seven populations in the sample are involved in the event			0
a second is the @entity57 slave trade , with @entity109 contributions from @entity20			1
people from around the @entity169 , the @entity170 and the @entity171			0
the @entity120 expansion seems , according to both history and genetics , to have been a particularly abrupt transfer of people and dna across @entity21			1
dna of the @entity103 people in modern @entity62 suggests that in around @entity107 , @entity19 similar to modern @entity105 mixed with an otherwise @entity62 - like population			1
plausibly , the researchers say , the source of this @entity19 - like dna might be merchants travelling the nearby @entity60			1
' although individual mutations carry only weak signals about where a person is from , by adding information across the whole genome we can reconstruct these mixing events			2
‘ sometimes individuals sampled from nearby regions can have surprisingly different sources of mixing			0
’ ‘ for example , we identify distinct events happening at different times among groups sampled within @entity72 , with some inheriting dna from @entity20 , perhaps related to the @entity199 , others from @entity21 , and yet another from ancient @entity19			1
‘ nearly all our populations show mixing events , so they are very common throughout recent history and often involve people migrating over large distances			2
' the team at @entity206 and @entity207 used genome data for all 1490 individuals to identify ' chunks ' of dna that were shared between individuals from different populations			2
they were able to pinpoint time frame when genetic mixing took place using genetic recombination – the biological process in which two dna molecules exchange genetic information			1
populations sharing more ancestry share more chunks , and individual chunks give clues about the underlying ancestry along chromosomes			0
' each population has a particular genetic “ palette ” ’ , said dr @entity231 of the @entity232 in @entity233 , co-senior author of the study			2
' if you were to paint the genomes of people in modern - day @entity240 , for example , you would use a mixed palette with colours from @entity244 - like , @entity245 and @entity137 dna			2
’ this mix dates back to around @entity247 , consistent with historical accounts describing @entity244 and @entity245 people entering the @entity250 around that time			0
the @entity120 expansion seems , according to both history and genetics , to have been a particularly abrupt transfer of people and dna across @entity21 researchers identified distinct events happening at different times among groups sampled within @entity72 ( pictured ) , with some inheriting dna from @entity20 the group with the longest time since admixture is the @entity86 from @entity72			1
they have an ancient inferred event prior to @entity89 , involving mixing between a more @entity19 and @entity91 group , and a more @entity266 / @entity93 group			1
some @entity86 believe they are descended from the army of @entity75			0
the date shown in the interactive map does not rule this out but the date range also allows for many other possibilities			0
though we ca n't directly sample dna from the groups that mixed in the past , we can capture much of the dna of these original groups as persisting , within a mixed palette of modern - day groups , ’ said dr @entity231			0
‘ this is a very exciting development			0
' as well as providing fresh insights into historical events , the new research might have implications for how dna impacts health and disease in different populations			0
' understanding well the genetic similarities and differences between human populations is key for public health , ' said dr @entity293			0
some populations are more at risk of certain diseases than others , and how well certain drugs work is also known to vary significantly			0
rare genetic mutations are particularly likely to show strong differences between populations , and understanding their role in human health is an area of intense current research efforts			0
the researchers hope that in the future they can include even more detailed sequencing , to spot these rare mutations and better understand their global spread			0
‘ this really is a fascinating insight , ’ said dr @entity63			0
‘ imagine just how much more can be found out with even more detailed sequencing			0
’ this graphic shows how a @entity315 population and migrants from @entity245 mixed in the ancestors of today 's @entity319 people			2

@entity321 shows the mixing of genes of 95 different populations across @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22
it reveals colonialism , the @entity57 slave trade and @entity19 traders on the @entity60 mixing with people in @entity62
scientists pinpointed time when mixing took place by looking areas of dna that exchanged genetic information
