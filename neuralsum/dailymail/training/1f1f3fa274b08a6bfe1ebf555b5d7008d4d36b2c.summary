by @entity0 within the next decade , the online video market as we know it could be turned on its head with no more adverts , no more channels , and no more menus			1
that ’s according to @entity9 ’s chief product officer @entity8 who made the statements at the @entity12 event in @entity13			1
he predicts that by ‘ 2025 or sooner ’ services such as his own , will have mastered personalisation to the point where sites know what users want to watch before they sign in			1
@entity9 's chief product officer @entity8 predicts that within the next decade , grid - style menus of titles will be replaced by highly personalised choices , including guessing what viewers will want before they sign in			1
@entity8 also claims standard channels will be replaced by a ' different channel ' for each of its 50 million subscribers in april , @entity9 signed a deal with three small cable - providers in the @entity31 to become a regular tv channel			1
the agreements with @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 gives the internet streaming site 's subscription service a channel on @entity41 boxes that the companies provide their customers			0
it debuted on @entity45 and @entity35 before expanding on to @entity47 's service at the end of april			0
and everyone will get their own , dedicated channel			0
‘ our vision is , you wo n’t see a grid and you wo n’t see a sea of titles , ’ said @entity8			2
instead , @entity9 will show viewers up to four tv shows or films it thinks they will want to watch , based on previous shows , the time of day , the day of the week , and more			0
by linking to social networks , @entity9 could even learn a viewer ’s mood based on their most recent posts , or suggest films following a change in relationship status			2
however , this is still a little way off as @entity9 's ceo @entity71 admitted at today 's @entity72 that only ' a few people ' are sharing @entity9 views on @entity75 , but ' auto - sharing has n’t yet panned out			1
' in terms of channels , @entity8 believes that as personalisation improves , fewer people will watch standard channels created by networks			1
@entity8 , pictured , made the comments at the @entity12 event in @entity13			1
he said that adverts in online videos could be ditched completely , and brands would need to find alternative methods to promote their goods			0
alternatively , there could be fewer , but more personalised and targeted adverts by linking to social networks , @entity9 could learn a viewer 's mood based on their most recent posts , or suggest shows , such as its own @entity96 starring @entity98 , pictured , based on political beliefs			2
in terms of channels , @entity8 believes as personalisation improves , fewer people will watch standard channels instead , each @entity9 subscriber - which at the end of april was approaching 50 million - would be served an individual channel , built specifically for them			1
@entity8 also said that adverts could be ditched completely following customer feedback , and brands would need to find alternative methods to promote their goods			2
alternatively , there could be fewer , but more personalised and targeted adverts that generate the best conversion			0
when asked about the controversial topic of internet fast lanes for web traffic , @entity8 said @entity9 was in support of net neutrality			0
he added @entity9 should be the leading provider because it offers the best service , not because it can afford to pay for faster access			0
at today 's event , @entity71 said net neutrality would n’t be an issue if cable companies had competition for internet in the home			2
until 2010 , @entity127 and @entity128 invested tens of billions of dollars to compete with cable , but ended the project when they admitted they could n't compete			0
@entity71 added he is concerned cable operators will begin raising the prices for services such as @entity9 , and this could impact on the prices they charge .			0

@entity8 made the claims at the @entity12 event in @entity13
he predicts that ‘ by 2025 or sooner ’ the online video market will look *drastically* different
grid - style menus of titles will be replaced by highly personalised choices
this includes guessing what viewers want and presenting *minimal* options
@entity8 claims standard channels will be replaced by ' channels for everyone ’
social networks will also play a role in improving personalisation
but , *speaking* earlier today , ceo @entity71 said ' auto - sharing on @entity75 has n't yet panned out '
