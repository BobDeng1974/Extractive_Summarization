by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:06 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 12:05 est , 4 february 2013 as confetti rained on the @entity5 last night , @entity3 quarterback @entity2 dropped an f - bomb as he celebrated with teammates following their incredible @entity9 win			1
the two - second delay did not appear to be working after the clock ran out in the fourth quarter , and live mics and cameras were rushed to the field to capture the festivities			1
but with that came some material that was unintended for the more than 100 million people who tuned in to the national @entity9 telecast on @entity21			1
the @entity37 would not comment on the @entity2 situation when reached by @entity42 today			1
last year , the @entity43 apologized after singer @entity44 gave cameras the middle finger during @entity48 's halftime show			0
but none would be as notorious as @entity51 's ' wardrobe malfunction ' during the big game in 2004			0
an @entity37 fine against @entity21 was later thrown out in court nearly eight years later			0
win : @entity2 pumps his fist as he walks off the field with his wife @entity57 after @entity9 swearing : a live mic caught @entity26 and @entity2 in a profane exchange as confetti rained down on the field capping a perfect postseason , the unassuming and unheralded @entity2 completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three first - half touchdowns , earning @entity31 honors			1
in post-game interviews , @entity2 set aside any questions about just how good he is and whether he belongs in the conversation about the league 's best quarterbacks , becoming only the sixth in 47 @entity9 to throw for three scores in a first half			1
' now they 're gon na have to talk about @entity2 , ' center @entity74 said			1
' @entity2 's a stud			2
' mvp : @entity2 holds up the @entity80 during the post-game ceremony at the @entity5 the admittedly mild - mannered guy , who played his college football far from the spotlight at @entity85 , wrapped up @entity3 's four - game run to the title with a record - equaling 11 touchdown passes and zero interceptions , going 73 of 126 for 1,140 yards			1
but @entity2 's job in the second half sunday was more about being safe than spectacular			2
he had helped @entity3 take a 21 - 6 halftime lead , and it grew to 28 - 6 when @entity93 returned the second - half kickoff a @entity9 - record 108 yards			1
that 's when things got strange			0
first , the lights inside the @entity5 cut out , delaying action for more than a half - hour			0
and when play resumed , @entity99 quickly scored 17 consecutive points to make things interesting			2
the @entity3 held on down the stretch			0
two short field goals by rookie @entity105 padded the lead , and the @entity108 - led defense stopped the 49ers on a fourth - and - goal at the 5 with under 2 minutes left			2
' i was sitting there thinking , " there 's no way			0
there 's no way we stop them here , " ' @entity2 said			2
' neither @entity2 nor his team appeared to be ready to take on all comers as the regular season concluded			2
after all , the @entity3 lost four of their final five games to stumble into the playoffs			0
and @entity2 , a fifth - year pro , finished only 12th in the 32 - team @entity43 in passer rating at a merely passable 87.7 - way behind league leader @entity125 ' 108.0 - while compiling 22 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions			1
champs : @entity2 congratulates teammate @entity108 , who has announced he would retire after the @entity9 middle - of - the - pack , to say the least			1
but he and his team definitely did shine when the results mattered most			0
' i tell you what : we do n't make it easy , ' said @entity2 , who set an @entity43 quarterback record by leading his team to playoff wins in each of his first five seasons			0
he is 9 - 4 overall in the postseason , but was 0 - 2 in @entity142 championship games until this year			0
and now his contract is up			0
he could wind up with one of the most lucrative deals in @entity43 history , perhaps commanding somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 20million a year			0
jubilant : @entity2 holds up the @entity80 as he 's interviewed by @entity21 commentator @entity149 following their 34 - 31 win against the @entity99 49ers watch video here			1
