global warming has opened up an @entity2 route mariners have been craving for centuries , making the journey from @entity5 to @entity6 shorter			1
a large sea freighter has become the first cargo vessel to successfully navigate the hazardous @entity2 @entity9 carrying - somewhat ironically - coal			1
if other ships decide to use the crossing through the @entity2 , along the northern coast of @entity16 connecting the @entity18 and @entity17 , their route would be 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the best alternative			1
global warming has opened up a route mariners have been craving for centuries - a shorter journey from @entity5 to @entity6			1
a large sea freighter became the first cargo vessel to successfully navigate the hazardous @entity2 @entity9 ( pictured ) between @entity5 and @entity25 the 75,000 deadweight - tonne @entity26 , built in 2011 and specially strengthened to cross icy waters , left the @entity29 port of @entity30 in early september with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in the @entity34 port of @entity35 on october 7 , according to @entity37 shipping data			1
' the @entity9 is more than 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the @entity39 and will save time , fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions , but even more importantly increase the amount of cargo per transit 25 percent , ' said @entity45 , the @entity47 owner of the ship			1
harsh conditions in the @entity2 sea route so far have limited shipping mostly to small cargo vessels and ice - breakers , which supply northern @entity29 communities			1
the 75,000 deadweight - tonne @entity26 ( pictured ) , built in 2011 and specially strengthened to cross icy waters , left the @entity29 port of @entity30 in early september with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in the @entity34 port of @entity35 on october 7 , according to @entity37 shipping data the 225 metre long @entity26 , a panamax - sized ship that is currently off the western coast of @entity25 , has a strengthened bulk to cope with floating ice			1
the vessel is to deliver the coal to @entity65 , a @entity34 steel producer , which is ironic seeing as many climate scientists have blamed the melting of @entity2 ice as a consequence of warmer temperatures caused by greenhouse gases emitted by burning fossil fuels , particularly coal			1
as the ice continues to melt , some experts have estimated that shipping via the @entity2 could account for a quarter of the cargo traffic between @entity6 and @entity76 by 2030			1
' the @entity9 is more than 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the @entity39 and will save time , fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions , ' said @entity45 , the @entity47 owner of the ship			1
a selection of routes through the passage are pictured last november , @entity86 gas export company @entity85 made the first ever delivery of liquefied natural gas through the @entity2 north - east route , sailing from @entity90 east to @entity91			2
many maritime analysts have said , however , that large volumes of commercial shipping via the @entity2 are at least 10 years away			2
while mariners might be excited by the prospect of faster journeys , some people are concerned what would happen in the event that one of the commercial ships ran into trouble in the remote and icy waters			0
@entity106 , an expert in global politics and international law at the @entity109 , said : ' there are the environmental risks			0
the coal being carried by the @entity26 would not cause much damage in the event of an accident			2
but the fuel oil on board the vessel certainly would			0
' as the ice continues to melt , some experts have estimated that shipping via the @entity2 could account for a quarter of the cargo traffic between @entity6 and @entity76 by 2030			1
but some people are concerned about the potential environmental impact as an accident in the hazardous waters could see fuel oil polluting the sea writing in an article for @entity130 , he warned that shallow waters and icebergs still pose a risk to ice - strengthened ships			2
he said small , hard chunks of ice called ' growlers ' that float low in the water are incredibly difficult to spot , while ' icing ' - when ocean spray freezes onto the outside of a ship - can cause it to become top - heavy and capsize			2
in the event of an emergency , he also warned that @entity5 's search and rescue capabilities are ' desperately poor '			0
he said long - range helicopters could take a whole day to reach parts of the @entity150 , offering little help to stranded crews , who even wearing survival suits could freeze to death in just one hour in the harsh environment			0

@entity168 tanker - icebreaker @entity166 ( pictured ) was the first commercial ship to make the east - west trip through @entity9 in 1969 the news of the ' new ' crossing comes in the same week that the @entity174 â€™ @entity173 ( @entity173 ) released it 's latest high profile report			0
the @entity174 scientists today said they are ' 95 per cent ' certain that climate change is man made , but still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years			0
the @entity173 said that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 26 - 82cm by the end of the century			0
it added that concentrations of @entity184 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years			0
as expected , the @entity173 raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 26 - 82cm by the end of the century			0
the previous report predicted a rise of 18 - 59cm			0
storms will become more intense and frequent , and the oceans will become more acidic , the report predicted .			0

the @entity26 left @entity30 in early september with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in @entity34 on 7 october
the route connecting the @entity18 and @entity17 , is 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the @entity39
as the ice continues to melt , experts estimate shipping via the @entity2 could account for a quarter of the cargo traffic between @entity6 and @entity76 by 2030
