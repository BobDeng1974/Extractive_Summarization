by @entity0 published : 14:53 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 16 april 2013 it is one of @entity4 's most celebrated and historical monuments , built thousands of years ago by a dedicated team of workmen			0
with no enormous diggers and machines , the workmen all lived close to @entity10 as they developed the site			2
and now , more than 4,500 years later , the huts used as temporary homes by the workmen have been reconstructed			0
however , there is one noticeable and rather smelly difference			0
historic : the huts used as temporary homes by the workmen who built @entity10 are being reconstructed			1
it is unlikely , however , that the workmen did not live next to a pig farm all those years ago ancient : the huts are replicas of those lived in 4,500 years ago by workmen who built @entity10 attraction : three of the @entity30 houses will form the focal point of the new £ 27million visitor centre at @entity10 project : a team of 60 volunteers is currently test - building the huts in a living history project at a nearby site at @entity39 , near @entity40 , @entity41 it is highly likely the workers living in the temporary homes all those years ago did not have to cope with a smelly pig farm as a neighbour			1
three of the @entity30 houses which are currently being built will form the focal point of a new £ 27 - million visitor centre at the historic attraction			1
a team of 60 volunteers is currently test - building the huts in a living history project at a nearby site at @entity39 , near @entity40 , @entity41			1
as the top picture shows , it is next to an enormous pig farm			0
they are being modelled on the ruins of the biggest @entity30 settlement ever found in @entity60 at @entity61 around two miles from @entity10			1
impressive : the huts are being modelled on the ruins of the biggest @entity30 settlement ever found in northern @entity60 at @entity61 - around two miles from @entity10 looking back : @entity65 say the huts will offer an authentic glimpse of the lifestyle and technology of the @entity30 people who built @entity10 fascinating : @entity65 said the settlement found near @entity10 was probably a large temporary ' construction camp ' for the monument ancient : the three huts will be built at the @entity10 visitor centre around 1.5 miles to the west of the monument early next year the prehistoric monument of @entity10 is one of the most famous sites in the world			1
the circular earth bank and ditch which surrounds the site is believed to be the earliest part of the monument , dating back to about @entity88			2
evidence found by archeologists indicated that @entity10 could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings			0
cremated human remains have been found on the site			0
the site has always been a place of religious significance , particularly by @entity98			0
there are many conspiracy theories and mysteries surrounding @entity10			0
this includes that the monument was constructed by the wizard @entity104			0
historically , many believed that the rocks at @entity10 were healing rocks , brought from @entity109 by @entity110			2
@entity65 said the site was probably a large temporary ' construction camp ' for the monument			1
the extremely rare remains of ten houses were excavated between 2006 - 7 , revealing the size and layout of the floors and the stakeholes where the walls once stood			0
radiocarbon tests dated the buildings from around the same time that the sarsen stones were being put up at @entity10 , about 2,500 bc. but the appearance of the houses above ground is unknown and the project is testing different structures and materials - stone , straw , wood and dung - on the prototypes			1
once the best materials have been found three similar huts will be built at the @entity10 visitor centre around 1.5 miles to the west of the monument early next year			1
@entity65 says they will offer an authentic glimpse of the lifestyle and technology of the @entity30 people who built @entity10			1
working hard : @entity142 and @entity143 lay straw onto a neolithic hut roof at @entity39 ambitious : volunteers started building the prototypes at @entity39 in early march and expect to finish the experiment in may experience : those behind the project say the huts will bring visitors as close as they can to appreciate what life was like for the individuals who built @entity10 bold : this shows a computer generated image of the outdoor gallery of the new @entity10 visitor centre @entity162 , senior properties historian , said : ' the stunning discovery made at @entity61 presents us with a tantalising opportunity to do something special at the new visitor centre			1
' the reconstructed houses will be an immediate and sensory link to the distant past , and will bring visitors as close as they can to appreciate what life was like for the extraordinary individuals who built @entity10			2
' we have lots of evidence to inform this reconstruction , but there is also a lot of educated guess work			0
' building the prototypes will enable us to test things such as the roofing structure , roofing materials and various construction techniques , and learn more about late @entity30 people , their tools and technology , ideas of comfort and privacy and social organisation , among other things			2
' monument : the three huts being built are similar to those which were used to house workers who built the famous @entity10 tough job : a volunteer works on a wall at one of the neolithic house recreations proud : @entity205 and @entity162 , who are organising the neolithic house recreation at @entity39 , are pictured protection : a volunteer lays straw onto a neolithic hut roof at @entity39 volunteers started building the prototypes at @entity39 in early march and expect to finish the experiment in may			1
the visitor centre , due to be opened at the end of this year , is being financed almost entirely by @entity217 money , @entity65 commercial income and donations from generous benefactors			2
the existing outdated facilities will be demolished and the car park will be grassed over and replaced by a small , security ' hub ' tucked into the landscape			0
find : this image shows the excavations of neolithic hut floors at @entity61 discovery : the neolithic house recreations at @entity39 are based on this excavation experiment : volunteers say building the prototypes will enable them to test things such as the roofing structure and roofing materials			0

huts are modelled on ruins of huge @entity30 settlement near @entity10
site believed to be a large ' construction camp ' for the monument
now three @entity30 houses are being built by volunteers
they will be focal point of new £ 27 - million visitor centre at @entity10
