and it appears the most efficient way to collect the trees is by using a really fast chopper			2
it would probably take several burly men hours to drag the trees from where they are felled to a nearby pick - up truck			0
but at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , a handy helicopter and its skilled pilot hoist no less than four trees into a truck in this 90 - second clip			1
and despite the foggy sky , the pilot appears to have no trouble navigating at all and instead shows off his skill by completing the task as quickly as possible			1

over the course of the clip , the first is loaded with trucks and ready to go and it will no doubt take no time at all to pack the other two			0
