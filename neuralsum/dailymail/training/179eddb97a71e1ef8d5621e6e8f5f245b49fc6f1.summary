by @entity0 known as the most glamorous of @entity2 , @entity1 certainly kept that title as she arrived at @entity5 today			1
there to support long term beau @entity7 in his first game of the tournament against @entity11 's @entity10 , @entity1 chose to wear her own ' tennis whites ' in a show of support			2
with her trademark blow - dry firmly intact , @entity1 swept passed waiting photographers outside the stadium looking a tad nervous , no doubt residual fears from @entity7 ’s crushing defeat at @entity21 earlier this month			2
there was no need to worry this time , though , as @entity7 won his first round match against @entity10 in straight sets			0
clutching some serious arm candy in the form of her £ 1395 over sized cream leather @entity57 ' @entity56 ' tote and her favourite @entity59 charm bracelet , the only pop of colour in her outfit came from a thin pink belt and the green ribbon holding her vip access card			1
as defending champion @entity7 will play the first match on centre court in the opening game of the men ’s singles championship this afternoon			1
despite the tension @entity1 seemed to enjoy the day , a times looking positively elated devoted @entity1 , who met @entity7 when she was just 17 , attends many of his matches , watching animatedly from the sidelines @entity7 's crushing defeat just weeks before the start of @entity5 must have increased @entity1 's anxiety about the match @entity1 and @entity7 's mother @entity75 , who once described @entity76 as the ' best thing ' to happen to her son , greet each other warmly as they both took their seats court side @entity1 's nerves are likely to be running high as she watches @entity7 defend his title in the first @entity5 match @entity1 , who has been dating @entity7 for nine years , is known for her trademark pristine blow - dried hair however @entity1 ’s nerves are likely to be running high as she watches her boyfriend of nine years on court today			1
the 25 - year - old artist , who met @entity7 who met @entity90 when she was studying for her a levels aged just 17 , was courtside at his surprisingly easy defeat earlier this month at the @entity93 in @entity94			0
the @entity96 no 1 was beaten in straight sets 7 - 6 6 - 2 by @entity98 , the 35 - year - old ranked no 42 in the world , and beaten well			0
@entity1 carried a £ 1395 oversized cream leather @entity56 tote in ivory and mouse python @entity1 looked a little anxious as she arrived this morning , no doubt due to @entity7 's shock defeat at @entity107 's earlier this month however , despite the undoubted pressure he is feeling entering @entity5 as defending champion , having @entity1 by his side will be a comfort			1
@entity7 , 27 , has famously praised her ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘ fundamental ’ to their relationship			0
he said : ‘ @entity1 sees all of the emotions when i win or lose a match , she can tell how i ’m really feeling			0
’ @entity1 applauded her boyfriend on court as she watched the crucial match with a friend @entity1 and @entity7 live together in a a five bedroom property with two double garages in @entity125 , @entity126 , which he bought for £ 5m in 200 , and while she runs her own successful animal portrait company she is a constant and devoted support to the tennis star			1
@entity7 's own mother @entity75 once described @entity76 as the ' best thing ' to happen to her son			2
the pair are obviously close , greeting each other in a warm embrace as they both took their seats before the beginning of the match			0
@entity75 , 54 , herself a tennis coach entertained some of the waiting crowds by playing a few rallies with them .			0
