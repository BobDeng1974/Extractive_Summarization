by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 1 november 2013 this is the terrifying moment that a scrap yard worker was turned into a human fireball as he drained fuel from underneath a van			0
@entity7 , 33 , from @entity8 , was working in a pit underneath the van when an electric spark from a drill caused the fuel to burst into flames and set fire to his overalls			1
dramatic cctv footage captured mr @entity7 running for his life and desperately trying to put out the inferno as it engulfed his legs			1
mr @entity7 has not been able to work since and lost his job at @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37			2
this week his former bosses @entity39 and @entity40 were told to pay £ 40,000 for health and safety failings and £ 25,000 in costs			1
mr @entity7 said : ' i still remember the noise of the petrol fumes igniting and a wave of blue flames engulfing the pit			2
the pain was instant and intense			0
' they put me into an induced coma to stop the pain , and it was at least a couple of days later when i came around			1
when i woke up i could feel the pain immediately			0
' even now , more than three years later i still suffer flashbacks that cause me to wake in the middle of the night in a cold sweat			0
' i have n't been able to work since the accident and feel that i no longer want to be a car dismantler - the only trade i have ever known			2
' the @entity63 footage shows mr @entity7 draining fuel from the van before he was engulfed in flames the pit below the van suddenly explodes with mr @entity7 suffering injuries that have left him unable to work as the flames started to spread mr @entity7 ran for his life			1
his bosses have been fined £ 40,000 the blaze burns on as mr @entity7 ( off screen ) tries to put out the fire which has taken hold of his clothing @entity78 heard that it was common practice for the company to remove engine and gear box oil from vehicles so they could be used for scrap			1
to do this employees would puncture a hole in the fuel tank and allow the flammable liquid to drain into an open container			0
the court heard that the fire grew rapidly because there was petrol in the pit			0
car body parts and upholstery also added to the fire which spread to the whole workshop area			0
the company 's bosses were brought to court in a prosecution by the @entity105 , which inspected the site following the accident			2
they pleaded guilty to two breaches of the @entity109 and @entity110 2002 , one breach of the work at height regulations 2005 and two breaches of the @entity115			2
speaking after the hearing @entity105 inspector @entity116 said : ' @entity7 suffered severe burns as a result of this incident but he was very lucky not to have been killed			1
@entity35 was guilty of several serious safety breaches			1
' it failed to properly consider the risks its employees faced while removing fuel from vehicles , or to do anything about them			0
it was therefore almost inevitable that a worker would be badly burned in a fire			0
' the company had the right equipment to do the job properly but instead it allowed workers to stand in a pit surrounded by fuel vapours where just one spark from electric equipment could start a fire			1
' if the fuel had been removed in a well - ventilated area , or even outside , without any ignition sources nearby then the severe burns @entity7 suffered could have been avoided			1
' sadly , our investigation found the company ’s overall attitude to health and safety was poor to say the least			0

@entity7 suffered 22 per cent burns and has n't been able to work since
he was put into medically induced coma for two days after the accident
fire was caused by an electric spark from a drill which ignited fuel
firm 's boss fined £ 40,000 this week over health and safety breaches
