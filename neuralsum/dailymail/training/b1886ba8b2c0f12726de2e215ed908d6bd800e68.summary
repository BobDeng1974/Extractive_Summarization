by @entity1 reporter published : 21:42 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 6 june 2013 the latest episode of @entity3 shocked viewers with the brutal slaughter of multiple characters - but the creator of the series has insisted that the bloodbath was in fact based on historical events			1
fans of the @entity14 series were horrified to see some of their favourites murdered at a wedding , and some have accused writer @entity18 of going over the top with the extraordinary scenes			1
however @entity18 , author of the books on which the series is based , has revealed that the ' @entity22 ' was intended to reflect historical reality			1
it was based on two tragic moments in @entity27 history when feasts turned into fights - one of which was the @entity32 of 1440 at @entity33 , when the host killed his own guest after serving him with the ominous head of a black bull			1
a slaughter ensued true story ? : a still from the ' @entity22 ' episode of ' @entity3			1
' the show 's creator says the bloody scene came from historical fact for diehard viewers of @entity3 , one of the most shocking elements of last sunday 's episode was seeing the ' hospitality laws ' broken when the @entity59 family turned against their guests , the @entity61			1
these laws state that once people have broken bread with one another , they are forbidden from harming each other - and this custom was not invented by @entity18 himself			1
‘ it was stolen from history , ’ he said in an interview with @entity71			0
‘ hospitality laws were real in @entity76 society			0
a host and guest were not allowed to harm each other even if they were enemies			2
by violating that law , the phrase is , they “ condemn themselves for all time			0
” ’ ' @entity33 , toune and towre , @entity86 grant thou sink for sin ! and that e'en for the black @entity90 gat therein			1
' the ' @entity22 ' scene in @entity3 , which even shows the slaughter of a pregnant queen , may seem to be a particularly violent example of this type of treachery , but @entity18 copied it from the medieval past			1
‘ the @entity22 is based on a couple real events from @entity27 history , ’ @entity18 explained			1
at the @entity32 , in november 1440 , the 16 - year - old @entity101 was invited to @entity33 by sir @entity102 , who as chancellor of @entity27 was a leading member of the court of 10 - year - old @entity105 @entity102 feared the brothers @entity90 and their allies were becoming too powerful			2
so he brought in the men to eat and drink until the king 's men began ominously pounding drums			2
shameful past : unlike the @entity32 , it was the guests who killed the hosts in ' @entity116 ' red wedding			0
but the fictional and historical violence remains the same gory : the bloody scene of treachery shocked many fans the head of a black bull or boar was served - a sign that death is near			2
the king 's men then dragged the @entity101 and his followers out of the castle into the courtyard			0
after a mock trial that found them guilty of high treason , they were beheaded			0
@entity18 says he also based his equally loathed and beloved scene on another , more widely known instance of @entity138 brutality			1
‘ the larger instance was the @entity142 , ’ he explained , where one @entity27 clan slaughtered another			0
new history : @entity33 was the site of a gruesome and treacherous slaughter that has now become part of popular culture via ' @entity3 ' half crazy : but @entity18 says the carnage came from @entity27 history , not just his imagination as @entity152 tells it , the @entity151 had until a prescribed date to swear allegiance to the new king , @entity155			1
but the letter they sent to do so , due to bureaucratic mishandling and a secretary of state who had a bone to pick against the clan , did n't make it in time			0
the @entity165 , under the command of captain @entity164 visited the @entity151 at @entity142 in 1692			0
@entity165 , @entity18 explained , stayed with @entity166 , so the laws of hospitality were supposed to apply but were quickly - and murderously - ignored			2
the clans played cards together and then the @entity151 fell asleep			0
as they dozed , the vengeful @entity165 killed 38 of them in their beds			0
some 40 women and children escaped , only to perish in the blizzard that raged that night			0
though @entity18 has said the ‘ @entity22 ’ scene lost him a great many readers and that even he had trouble watching it in television form , he has defended the bloodshed by insisting that he is only reflected the dark side of human nature , as recorded throughout history			2
‘ no matter how much i make up , ’ he said , ‘ there ’s stuff in history that ’s just as bad , or worse			0
