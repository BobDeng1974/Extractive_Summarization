by @entity0 last updated at 11:35 pm on 19th december 2011 @entity1 attacked the @entity2 yesterday , describing it as an ‘ affront ’ to liberal democracy			1
forming an upper chamber using proportional representation has emerged as a key @entity8 demand for staying in a coalition with the conservatives			0
the deputy prime minister said legislation to replace the @entity2 with elected senators would be introduced early next year			1
and in an attempt to cheer his party ’s core supporters , he also argued for a ‘ liberal approach to tax ’ that would distinguish between earned income and ‘ unearned wealth ’			0
pledge : @entity1 , pictured today , vowed that reform of the @entity2 will go ahead as he delivered the annual @entity22 at @entity23 @entity8 sources said the party would push for a ‘ mansion tax ’ on expensive properties , or new taxes on high earners ’ pensions			1
on @entity31 , mr @entity1 said a @entity32 will be introduced for a mostly elected upper chamber – a change that could be forced past the @entity2 and into law by use of the @entity37 if necessary			1
until now , mr @entity1 had taken a back seat on the issue – allowing @entity41 cabinet office minister @entity40 to take the lead – but aides say he is now making @entity2 reform a key @entity8 policy , despite significant opposition from @entity46 and peers			1
the move would finally break the link between peerages and the permanent right to sit in the legislature , following decades of controversy over ‘ cash for honours ’			0
reform : @entity1 today promised to use the @entity37 if necessary to push through reform of the @entity2			1
the @entity8 want an 80 per cent elected upper chamber at least 80 per cent of senators would be elected using the single transferable vote electoral system long favoured by the @entity8			0
the system is likely to result in no party having an overall majority in the second chamber , as is the case currently			0
prime ministers would still be able to appoint a small number of unelected senators to temporary seats in the @entity2			2
there are almost 800 members of the @entity2 , making it the second - largest legislative body in the world after the @entity73 – but , on average , only 388 attend each day			2
under the @entity75 ’s plans , the @entity2 would be transformed over 15 years into a largely elected chamber with 300 members			0
constitutional reform : @entity79 removed all but the last 92 hereditary peers from the @entity2 in 1999 , however the second phase of reform stalled and was never completed critics argue that an elected second chamber would demand greater powers to block legislation from the @entity87 , although ministers insist none are planned			1
speaking at the think - tank demos , mr @entity1 described the @entity2 as ‘ perhaps the most potent symbol of a closed society ’			0
‘ @entity2 as currently constituted is an affront to the principles of openness which underpin a modern democracy , ’ he said			0
the deputy prime minister acknowledged he would need ‘ a significant degree of cross-party consensus on this , and indeed support from @entity2 themselves ’ , but added : ‘ let there be no doubt : if it comes to a fight , the will of the @entity87 will prevail			2

deputy pm vows to use @entity37 to force through @entity2 reform if necessary
