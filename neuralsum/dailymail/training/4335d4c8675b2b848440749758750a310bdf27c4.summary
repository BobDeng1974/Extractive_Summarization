these days drones are used for everything from farming to surveying remote regions to waging war			1
so it makes sense that one @entity8 designer has penned the @entity9 , which like bird watching charts , shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes			1
@entity16 ’s guide , however , details the differing kinds of flying robots used at war , as well as survival tips of how to hide from them			1
this is because these countries have used drones in wars such as @entity39 and are also more transparent than some other countries in disclosing information about the robots , such as their wingspan			1
however , the chart also includes drones from @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , the @entity49 and @entity50			2
in the air : a reaper from @entity53 on its approach to @entity55 after a mission			0
@entity57 , @entity58 , said the @entity59 were an ' indispensable military capability ' experienced ' pilots ' operate the @entity62 's £ 10million @entity52 ( @entity59 ) from a hi - tech control centre in @entity64			0
the controversial craft – about the size of a small executive jet – take off from conventional runways in @entity55 , southern @entity39			0
they then fly above the battlefield for up to 14 hours , with cameras beaming live high - definition images and radar data to commanders and crew on the ground			0
keeping a silent eye on a huge area , the devices are able to warn of enemy ambushes or @entity81 , and locate and monitor targets while airstrikes are planned			0
once authorised , they can launch the weapons to destroy them and it only takes seconds to act against enemies such as terrorist leaders and insurgents planting roadside bombs			0
it uses a skull icon to show that a drone is used for attack and a little eye to denote a surveillance vehicle			2
the chart , which mr @entity16 describes as ‘ 21st century bird watching ’ shows the vast array of flying war machines used today from the giant 130ft wingspan of the @entity103 drone to the petite @entity105 quadcopter , which measures just 23 inches			1
he said : ‘ most drones are used today by military powers for remote - controlled surveillance and attack and their numbers are growing			2
' the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) predicted in 2012 that within 20 years there could be as many as 30.000 drones flying over @entity33 soil alone			2
‘ as robotic birds will become commonplace in the near future , we should be prepared to identify them			0
this survival guide is an attempt to familiarise ourselves and future generations , with a changing technological environment			0
’ mr @entity16 told @entity123 that he was inspired to make his guide after watching people in @entity126 filming drones overhead to work out by the silhouette whether they were a major threat or not			1
the chart bearing the drone silhouettes also resembles the @entity132 issued during @entity133 , which were designed to help servicemen differentiate between friendly and enemy aircraft			2
mr @entity16 said that it was difficult to divide the drones into military and domestic categories as some models , such as the @entity140 , is a military drone used by @entity29 forces and is also used by the police in the @entity8 to track down drug dealers and growers			1
while the guide was intended as art , it includes survival tips taken from @entity151 ’s guide to countering drones , published in 2013			0
they include hiding under dense tree canopies , spreading pieces of glass on cars and roofs to reflect light and using space blankets , which hide heat from infrared cameras			0
the guide itself is printed on aluminium paper so it is ‘ a useful tool to interfere with a drone ’s sensors , ’ mr @entity16 said			1
‘ on a more associative level the mirrored material reminds us that drone surveillance is ultimately people watching people			1
in a way we are looking at ourselves through sophisticated mirrors , ’ he writes			0
the guide itself is printed on aluminium paper so it is ' a useful tool to interfere with a drone ¿ s sensors , ' its creator mr @entity16 said			1

@entity8 designer @entity16 penned the @entity9 , which shows the different shapes and sizes of flying robots used at war
the chart distinguishes between attack and surveillance drones as well as noting which countries use the different models
he was inspired to make his guide after watching people in @entity126 try to work out by a drone 's silhouette whether it was a major threat or not
