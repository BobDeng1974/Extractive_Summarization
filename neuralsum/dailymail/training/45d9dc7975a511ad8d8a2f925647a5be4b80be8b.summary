a charity dedicated to protecting ponies has sparked outrage by suggesting they should be eaten to save the species			2
@entity4 put forward the suggestion ' with reluctance ' as the best way to preserve herds on the ancient moorland			1
founder @entity10 believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a ' sustainable market ' for them			0
unusual dish : @entity4 founder @entity10 with a plate full of roast @entity19 pony meat on her farm in @entity22 fancy eating a horse ? the pony group has suggested that a viable market in pony meat ( left ) for human consumption is the only way to save the species			1
sausages made out of pony meat are also pictured ( right ) but @entity30 ( @entity30 ) reacted with fury , saying it would never support the breeding of animals for profit			1
the charity 's welfare officer @entity35 said : ' it would be very upsetting to look at foals which in six months ' time could be in someone 's burger			0
' @entity19 ponies are essential to the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in @entity22 by keeping the gorse under control			1
@entity4 suggested that to save them ponies should be eaten @entity19 ponies are essential to the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in @entity22 by keeping the gorse under control			1
their numbers have slumped from over 25,000 in the 1930s to fewer than 800 today			0
but with ponies selling for as little as £ 10 at auction , they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation			0
@entity30 favours birth control – castrating stallions , giving them vasectomies or gelding mares – to keep the number of foals down			2
@entity10 alongside her @entity63 on her farm in @entity65 near @entity66 , @entity22 but now the @entity4 has suggested that a viable market in meat for human consumption is the only way to save the species			1
in a letter proposing the idea sent to @entity30 , she said : ' i am writing to ask whether @entity30 would consider giving measured support to this understandably upsetting subject , which as pony lovers we find so hard to accept			1
with ponies selling for as little as £ 10 at auction , they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation ' it has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that @entity19 herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them			2
we are in real danger of ponies disappearing from @entity19 altogether			2
' she added that a meat trade would encourage pony herders to keep the herd 's young for at least three years – the entry level set for animals going for meat			0
that , in turn , would also mean animals not selected for slaughter could be broken and trained for riding and driving , best done from the age of three			0
' strangely , having a meat trade should improve a pony 's chances of finding a new home at sales , ' she wrote			0
the princess royal sparked similar protest in november last year by suggesting people should eat horse meat to improve welfare standards .			0
