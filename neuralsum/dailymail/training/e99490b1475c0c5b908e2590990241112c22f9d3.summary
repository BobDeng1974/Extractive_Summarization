by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 18 august 2013 the mother says the renowned tv star asked her to wear her private school uniform and sung a nursery rhyme while they had sex a renowned @entity9 actor whose sex life is already protected by a @entity12 super-injunction has been questioned by police over separate claims that he seduced a girl of 15			1
it is alleged that the married star of tv and films asked the girl to put on her private school uniform before a meeting during which he plied her with alcohol			1
the victim , now 39 , also makes the bizarre claim that the actor recited the nursery rhyme @entity26 during sex			1
she said she had originally been reluctant to report the incident to police but changed her mind last autumn after the @entity33 allegations made her ‘ see things differently ’			1
she said : ‘ i ’d always felt partly responsible for what happened , but [ the @entity37 inquiry ] made me realise that i was n’t responsible – he was , he was the adult			2
’ the woman , a civil servant and mother of three who lives in the @entity43 , was told by the @entity44 that it was ‘ entirely satisfied the sexual assault took place as you described ’			0
but the actor – who denied the claim when questioned by police and who can not be named – escaped prosecution for allegedly having sex with an underage girl because the law that applied at the time meant any charge had to be brought within a year of the incident taking place			1
in a wholly unrelated legal case in 2011 , the hugely popular star took out an injunction to prevent publication of claims about his private life			1
in the latest allegations , the woman said she had met the actor at a theatre in august 1989 , when she was 15			1
it was shortly before she started boarding school and the actor , now a household name , said her school was near his home and he would like to take her out			1
she called him in october and he said it would be ‘ nice ’ if she wore her uniform			0
they met in the local town centre and she says he drove her to his home where he gave her wine before they had sex			0
‘ it happened fairly quickly and i was compliant and just let him get on with it , ’ she said			0
‘ it was clear he knew what he was after			0
as we had sex he recited the nursery rhyme			1
’ women went to police as she said the @entity33 allegations had made her see the incident differently the woman , who has since been divorced twice , added : ‘ at the time i thought it seemed odd but now i just think it was horrible			1
’ he later dropped her back and said ‘ see you soon ’ , she claimed			0
after the police handed their file to the @entity44 , the woman received a letter explaining that it would be unable to take action			2
any charge would have been under the @entity105 and proceedings would have had to have started within a year of the incident			2
however , if there had been evidence that there was no consent , the actor could have faced a rape charge , prosecutors said			2
the woman , who first married at 18 and has attempted suicide twice , said the experience ‘ set the tone ’ for her expectations of men and of being used by them			2
she told the @entity121 : ‘ he knew what he was doing and does n’t care about anybody else			0
‘ he comes from a lovely background with a good education and he clearly feels entitled to behave like that			0
but he does not have the right			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
