@entity9 cubs @entity7 and @entity10 found a home with animal expert and zoo keeper @entity13 after they were born at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
there are less than 500 @entity9 tigers left in the wild , so zoo breeding programmes are essential in preserving the species			1
a third of @entity9 cubs born in captivity do n't make it to adulthood , so to ensure their survival , @entity13 agreed to give them round the clock care at home for the first few months of their lives			1
from riding a skateboard to playing with trucks in a sandpit , @entity7 and @entity10 adapted to a remarkably human lifestyle during their time living with the @entity52			1
they had their own purpose - built pool for when their thick coats made the heat unbearable , while sofas and beds became free - range for a sleepy cub wanting a cuddle with mr @entity13 ’s children : @entity41 , 16 , and @entity42 , eight			2
and they would even climb on to their beds where they would blend in among the soft toys			0
@entity13 took the cubs into his care after they were born at an @entity69 zoo in @entity15 the mischievous cubs learned to interact with the family - and even played with the children 's toys , their favourite being the skateboard mr @entity13 , 36 , a zookeeper and tiger enthusiast and a ‘ tiger daddy ’ according to his wife @entity79 , 37 , grew up in @entity80 , @entity81			1

the tigers have become a permanent fixture in the @entity101 home , blending in with their son 's soft toys just like children , the cubs loved playing with the toy digger in the garden and so naturally , when resident tiger @entity109 gave birth to her cubs it was mr @entity13 who volunteered to take two of them home			1
spot and @entity116 , so called because of their markings , are two of the most critically endangered tigers in the world			0
but safely within the walls of the @entity124 ' home , they quickly settled in , forming close bonds with the family and exploring the house and its surroundings like a pair of curious toddlers			2
mr @entity13 had to take on the role of their mother and provide round - the - clock care for his charges			2
he said : ‘ as with any baby , i had to make sure that everything was washed and sterile			0
and not just bottles – with the number of towels you ’re going through , it felt like the washing machine was going constantly			0
i was more exhausted than when my son was a baby			0
@entity13 has to act as a mother to the two young cubs : ' you never , ever forget in those first couple of months how dependent they are			2
everything you do has an impact on them , ' he explains @entity13 says by having the cubs at home , they are able to care for them in ways that a zoo ca n't , such as building them a custom - made pool ' naturally mum would lick them to stimulate them to go to the toilet , so i had to replicate that with my hand			1
you never , ever forget in those first couple of months how dependent they are			0
everything you do has an impact on them			0

' we do a variety of things with our cats that normally just would n’t be possible in captivity			0
we even play with them in a purpose - built pool			0
