you could call @entity1 the ultimate film buff			1
the 39 - year - old actor is so passionate about his craft that he has travelled with his wife and children to more than 250 film locations in an ‘ epic road trip ’ that began five years ago			1
their travels have taken them to some of the world ’s most popular spots – from the ‘ @entity23 ’ in @entity24 to the fire station featured in @entity16 – and lesser - known locations , including the house from @entity19 and the corner shop where @entity21 tries to buy alcohol in the film @entity21			2
it all stems back to a decision he made in 2010 when he returned from work one day and found his kids staring at the television and tablet computer in their @entity63 home			0
he thought it would be fun to take them to film locations in the @entity30 area , and the idea snowballed into something that has taken them across the @entity71 and provided lasting memories			1
@entity1 told @entity73 : ‘ i 've always been a fan of film , and the artists who have made so many iconic projects over the past 100 years			1
these artists are what have always inspired me to become an actor , so that i may one day have the same impact on someone as they have had on me			0
one of the highlights of the family 's travels as a visit to the @entity87 farm from @entity88 tourists are lured to @entity90 , @entity87 , to visit the farm where @entity88 was filmed @entity1 and @entity92 recreate @entity94 's final scene outside the @entity95 in @entity63 the family 's travels have taken them across the @entity71 , including the famous ' @entity23 ' in @entity24 tourists flocked to the @entity99 every day to recreate this scene from @entity101 in @entity103 , the @entity1 family visited the fire station featured in ghostbusters the fire station , which acted as a stand - in for the @entity16 ' headquarters , is located in @entity109 ‘ i 've always felt some of these locations were informal landmarks and tributes to the actors , directors , directors of photography and screenwriters who have done such great work			1
‘ to stand where @entity120 and @entity121 performed , or even @entity123 , or where @entity124 directed in @entity125 , it 's always been very special to me			0
‘ the world is covered with so much negativity , and i thought it was the perfect way to sort of jump into these imaginary worlds that have given everyone so much happiness through our lives			0
’ @entity1 said the hobby has provided invaluable bonding time with his wife , @entity92 , 40 , and their sons , @entity26 , 9 , and @entity141 , 6			1
one of the lesser - known locations was the @entity144 setting for @entity145 in friday the 13th scenes from the opening of @entity148 were filmed in this parking lot in @entity30 this scene from @entity148 was filmed in a car park at a bowling alley in on @entity153 their first visit was to @entity30 ’ @entity29 , where @entity1 and @entity26 recreated @entity31 ’s knife fight scene from @entity28			1
since then , they have visited homes from films or television programmes ( @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , and @entity166 music video , among them ) , sat on the bleachers at the @entity87 farm which served as the setting for @entity88 , and walked on the beach where scenes from @entity172 were filmed			1
@entity1 , who has had guest roles in programmes such as @entity175 , bones , @entity177 and @entity178 , even had his grandmother pose for a photo outside the @entity144 strip club which was the stand - in for the @entity183 in @entity184			1
@entity1 and @entity26 strike a pose outside the @entity30 home from @entity166 's video for thriller @entity26 and @entity141 sit outside the @entity190 home where the fictional @entity191 lived in @entity192 of the 250 - plus locations he has visited , @entity1 was blown away by the town of @entity195 , @entity196 , which served as a fictional town in the classic coming - of - age film @entity198			1
he said : ‘ it ’s a town that really has n’t changed much since the film			0
and it ’s not just a house or a street , but the entire town was [ featured ]			0
' when you ’re there , you can really have a sense of being in one of the greatest @entity63 films			0
it was sad as well , as my @entity211 shares the same age as the boys in the film when it was released			0
@entity26 channels @entity217 's character from @entity164 outside the @entity125 home shown in the film @entity217 starred in @entity164 as a teen who gets up to no good while his parents are away the @entity1 family 's road trips usually take them to @entity225 stadiums all over the @entity71 @entity1 said one of his favourite locations was @entity195 , @entity196 , where @entity198 was filmed ‘ when you ’re there it ’s a feeling as if time has moved on and the boys have grown up , as we have … but there ’s still that beautiful feeling of youth and hanging out with our friends just like the characters did , without a care in the world at one time			1
’ films from the 1980s – the @entity243 and any written and directed by @entity124 – hold sentimental value for @entity1 , who watched plenty of them while spending summers at his grandparents ’ home as he grew up in @entity250 , @entity103			2
he said : ‘ my grandparents were very special to me , and their house was the one place where there was so much love , with family and friends coming in and out all of the time			2
‘ those films attach my memories to my grandparents , and some of the best years of my life i 've had so far			0
@entity1 and his sons pose for a snap at a @entity30 hotel featured at the end of the 1982 film @entity267 poltergeist tells the story of a @entity46 family affected by strange events after moving into a new home fans of the classic film et are frequent visitors to this house in @entity278 , @entity46 ‘ my grandmother would be cooking , my grandfather either working in his tool shed or playing solitaire watching with us			1
i think ultimately that 's the magic of being at some of these locations , a fond memory of who i was with when i watched the films for the first time			2
’ but not all locations lived up to the family ’s expectations , given the passage of time			2
an @entity297 restaurant in the @entity298 , which was featured in @entity161 , is now a yarn store , while , and the diner from the opening scene of @entity302 is no longer there			0
they were unable to get close to the @entity144 lake where scenes from the original friday the 13th were filmed , as it is now a private camp operated by the @entity308			0
@entity1 and @entity92 share a kiss as they recreate a scene from @entity312 at a @entity103 apartment the family home featured in @entity162 has been preserved as a museum in @entity316 , @entity317 the family ’s next trip will take them to @entity321 , where they plan to visit locations from @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 ’s , @entity327 and @entity328			1
in the next few years they would love to visit locations in @entity331			0
as they continue to scratch locations off their list , @entity1 said he wants to publish a travel guide for other tourists who share his passion			2
‘ as well as being in the business as an actor , i am equally a fan , and have a tremendous appreciation for so many brilliant actors , directors , writers before me			0
‘ ideally , i 'd like to put together a book once i 'm finished , combining not only the addresses within the states of these classic locations , but also gps road maps to unique hotels and eats throughout the country			0
