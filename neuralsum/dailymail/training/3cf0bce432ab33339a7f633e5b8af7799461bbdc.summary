an architect has lovingly built an incredible floating home which is part contemporary box and part warehouse to indulge his love of the water			1
@entity5 , a retired contractor and his son , @entity7 , spent a year building the house which is located on @entity9 at the @entity10 in @entity11			1
the stunning floating home was designed by @entity13 of @entity14 for mr @entity5 and his wife @entity16			1
stunning : it took a year to build the contemporary - meets - wharf - warehouse home in @entity11 the couple gave up a 4,000 - square - foot home in @entity11 for life on the water and have lived on the lake since november 2008			1
they describe themselves as ‘ water people ’ who love nothing more than messing around on the lake			1
they reveal that they welcomed the change in lifestyle that their ‘ impulse ’ buy of a slip gave them			2
‘ the boys were gone and we both were working and doing a bad job of taking care of our house , ’ mrs @entity39 told the @entity40			0
' we went to some open houses			0
this was an impulse buy , ' he added			0
their incredible one of a kind house on a dock holds eight newer homes that sit behind a locked gate			0
but its unusual exterior tends to attract a good deal of gawping and stares from passers - by who are always keen to take a closer look			2
‘ it ’s a lot less private in summer ’ mrs @entity39 said			0
‘ but we ’re used to waving at boaters			0
’ what a view ! the living room opens completely onto @entity9 with two automatic garage doors bedroom : the guest bedroom is open to its surrounding dockside views and anchored in walls of bookshelves @entity9 home : the spiral staircase winds up to the rooftop deck complete with a putting green , the exterior of the home is @entity78 ( a plastic - laminate composite ) vertically banded with western red cedar battens , which gives it that crate - like effect says architect @entity13 the @entity84 ’s floating home has two bedrooms , 2½ baths and is under 2,000 square feet and sits on a float of @entity88 surrounded by concrete			1
the quirky , modern design by @entity13 combines the look of a warehouse along the wharf , with a wooden look and a rugged exterior			0
the house features a signature external metal spiral staircase and a 30 - by - 40 - foot rooftop patio with a fair ( way ) - sized putting green			1
the main living spaces are at water level with two garage doors to remove separation from living room and lake			1
the second floor has a master suite , laundry , den and a guest room			0
spectacular : the kitchen is earthy and active with vertically placed ( and perfectly matched ) zebrawood cabinets crafted by @entity115 in @entity116 , the counter , also a dining table for eight , is granite outlined in steel bathroom : tiny glass tiles lining the walls of the main - floor powder room cast a shimmer much like the sun glinting off the lake on a bright day hallway : a large skylight drives light through the home			1
the painting on the left is by @entity134 of @entity135 @entity136 : open stairs to the private spaces keep the eye moving through the main living area and a porthole windows over the desk are a natural for life on the lake the interior was created by @entity147 of @entity147 interior design who worked in warm colours			2
the pair say that they enjoy the surrounding community			2
their home is within walking distance of @entity156 , downtown and the @entity157			2
when the weather warms up they enjoy the lake itself which is suitable for a nice dip			0
