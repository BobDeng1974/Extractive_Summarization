these symptoms become evident around 10 to 15 days after being bitten			0
the parasite has become resistant to some treatments and , with no effective vaccine , trying to halt the disease has been limited to controlling mosquitoes , distributing pesticide - laced nets for homes and spraying the indoors of buildings with insecticides - the method known as vector control			1
at - risk people , including pregnant women and children , can also take antimalarial medications during seasons when the cases of malaria are highest			1
the @entity141 points out that no antimalarial drug is 100 per cent protective and should be used in conjunction with other measures like insecticides			0
