by @entity0 man problem : @entity4 's disease leads to abnormal curvature , indentations and shrinkage of the penis a jab used for ‘ claw hand ’ may offer hope to male patients suffering a common cause of sexual dysfunction			1
@entity4 ’s disease ( @entity16 ) is caused by the growth and hardening of fibrous plaques in the soft tissue of the penis , leading to abnormal curvature , indentations and shrinkage			1
the condition affects up to ten per cent of men , mostly white and over 40 , though some are as young as 18			1
it is considered problematic enough for treatment only if the abnormal curvature is more than 30 degrees – as more than this might mean intercourse is painful for both partners , or impossible			1
the drug @entity35 , also known by @entity37 brand name @entity35 , is a recognised therapy for @entity40 ’s contracture , otherwise known as claw hand , a condition in which similar fibrous plaques prevent the straightening of the fingers			1
@entity48 ’s sufferers include @entity49			2
the active ingredient in @entity35 , collagenese , is a natural enzyme which breaks down excess collagen			2
it is administered in a series of injections into the plaque , while massaging is used to encourage the break up of problem tissue			0
after effects can include bruising and swelling , and to eliminate the risk of accidental ruptures that would lead to permanent erectile dysfunction , it can be administered only by experienced urologists trained in its application			0
@entity35 was granted approval in the @entity37 for treatment of @entity16 last year			1
its safety and effectiveness were established in two randomised double - blind , placebo - controlled studies in 832 men			2
participants were given up to four treatment cycles of @entity35 or a placebo and were then followed for 52 weeks			0
the drug treatment significantly reduced curvature deformity and related problems			2
the @entity84 rights to @entity35 were originally licensed to @entity85 , which has since given up options on the drug			0
it has now been picked up by @entity90 pharmaceutical group @entity89 , which is seeking a @entity84 licence for use in @entity16			1
however , the drug company wranglings have been a setback			0
the only treatment currently sanctioned by the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) is shockwave therapy , using targeted sonic pulses			0
man woes : if the abnormal curvature of the penis is more than 30 degrees intercourse might be is painful for both partners , or impossible reports indicate a 50 per cent success rate in breaking up the plaque			1
although @entity96 is satisfied the procedure is safe , experts remain divided			0
surgery is another option but this often leads to shortening of the penis by an inch on average and is not commonly offered on the @entity115 , as the condition is benign			1
the cost privately is about £ 4,000			0
it is estimated it would cost £ 2,000 for enough to treat @entity16			1
dr @entity118 , clinical trial investigator in the department of urology at the @entity121 , said : ‘ in my practice , treating @entity16 has been a challenge as , until now , we have had few options to offer our patients			2
' i believe [ @entity35 ] is a significant achievement and offers a new option for urologists : the first approved treatment to be administered non-surgically that is proven safe and effective for this physically and psychologically devastating disorder			0
’ @entity134 , a consultant at @entity135 , welcomes the innovation , saying : ‘ i ’d like to be able to offer my patients an alternative to surgery			0
’ a range of alternative treatments , including supplements and mechanical gadgets , are offered by small companies on the internet but @entity134 , a consultant at @entity146 , urges caution			0
‘ for anyone who suspects they may have @entity4 ’s , the first port of call should always be a gp or a qualified urologist , ’ he says .			2

a jab used to treat ' claw hand ' can now be used for @entity4 's disease ( @entity16 )
@entity16 leads to abnormal curvature , indentations and shrinkage of the penis
it affects up to ten per cent of men and can severely affect sex life
