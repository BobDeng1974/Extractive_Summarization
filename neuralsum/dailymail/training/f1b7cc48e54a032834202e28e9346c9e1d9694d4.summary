supporters of the three biggest clubs in @entity2 were not surprised to see the images of @entity4 destroying @entity5 on wednesday morning			1
@entity7 and @entity8 fans still wish their clubs had moved for him in 2011 and @entity12 supporters will never forget the way his goals got them back into the @entity16 and made them believe they could mix it with the top two			1
fate has kept @entity4 out of the clutches of @entity8 and @entity7 just as injuries have kept him off the @entity23 podium but no - one in @entity2 or in his native @entity24 believes the @entity26 striker is , on his day , any less of a player than @entity28 and @entity29			1
this season he has scored 17 of @entity26 's 38 goals - that 's a greater percentage of his team 's goals than both @entity28 and @entity29			1
how different things might have been in the @entity54 final if @entity4 had been fit to partner his old friend @entity29 against @entity34			1
@entity4 and @entity29 ’s friendship goes back to 2005 when they played at the @entity58 in @entity59 together			1
they were room - mates , friends and strike partners as @entity24 won @entity63 in 2008			0
the pair also became fathers around the same time and @entity29 ’s son @entity66 plays with @entity4 ’s boy @entity67 whenever the two get together			2
@entity29 wanted @entity4 to join him at @entity7 three years ago but @entity7 had just won the @entity16 with @entity68 and @entity69 scoring in the final – the timing was wrong			1
@entity4 takes on two @entity7 defenders , including captain @entity73 , during his time at @entity12 @entity29 celebrates with @entity4 during the @entity75 when they became friends and strike partners @entity4 has a fantastic scoring record for club and country but has always been hampered by injuries @entity83 ran a story that summer stating @entity8 would have signed @entity4 had he switched agents and joined @entity87 ’s representative @entity86			1
@entity87 was never entirely convinced by @entity88 , had reservations at the time about @entity91 and wanted the then 23 - year - old @entity4			2
@entity93 president @entity92 was ready to break a pact with city rivals @entity12 to not sign their players , such was his desire to land @entity4 who believed @entity8 were set to move for him			2
the player boldly announced he was leaving @entity12 but the move never transpired and @entity4 ended up at @entity26			2
@entity92 still wants the player so many in @entity2 liken to @entity100 – bull - like strength ; so difficult to knock off the ball ; the most complete of finishers			0
despite his final - hour dalliance with @entity8 , @entity12 supporters will never lose their respect for @entity4			2
in the 2007 - 08 season he was @entity51 ’s outstanding player , taking @entity12 to the @entity16 for the first time in 11 years			0
they won the @entity109 with him in 2010 a year before he left			0
the @entity26 striker scored against @entity34 in a friendly this year ... but missed the @entity54 final a fresh - faced @entity4 signed for @entity12 in 2006 , and has long been a target for their city rivals @entity8 ‘ always fight to the end , ’ was @entity4 ’s post-match message in a tweet after he had single - handedly kept @entity26 in the @entity16			1
he is best understood in his homeland as a battleship of a player who never gives in and has the character to match his talent			0
this is a player who never had the luxury @entity29 enjoyed of turning up in @entity7 aged 12 and being allowed to gradually adapt as he moved up through the youth ranks			2
@entity4 was thrown in at the deep end at boyhood club @entity128 , making his debut as a 15 - year - old			0
they still love him there – the goal he scored from the halfway line in a 4 - 0 win over local rivals @entity137 in 2005 remains many fans ’ all - time favourite			0
they would welcome him back , as would the supporters of @entity12			0
the @entity8 faithful have not given up hope that @entity92 can land him next summer and there are @entity7 fans who feel , as good as @entity147 is , that @entity4 would have been a cheaper option back in 2011			1
@entity4 scores the winning goal against @entity150 in 2012 to win @entity26 their first @entity152 title a superb finisher with bull - like strength , @entity4 is often compared with @entity156 legend @entity100 @entity157 proud of @entity26 fightback @entity4 scores his second against @entity5 on tuesday night during a display of fabulous finishing as @entity162 wrote in his match report after @entity26 's win over @entity5 on tuesday night : ' @entity4 is every bit as important to them as @entity167 was to @entity168 last year or @entity169 to @entity170 the year before			1
' if he were to move on like those two , he could command a fee more than the world - record £ 86m @entity169 cost @entity8 and well over the £ 75m @entity7 paid for @entity167			0
because both those deals have been done it may be that once again neither club makes a move for ‘ @entity177 ’			0
and if destiny goes on keeping him out of the grasp of @entity2 ’s big two , the biggest winner will continue to be @entity26			0
