a routine stand - up paddleboard session unexpectedly turned into a giant turtle rescue mission on friday morning			1
lifeguard @entity2 was instructing the class at @entity4 , near @entity5 - north of @entity6 , when she noticed what looked like a fin in the distance			1
once she established the fin was n't a shark and was in fact a green turtle , ms @entity14 was determined to bring it to safety			1
but it was her remarkable quick - thinking and improvised rescue technique - where she dove in after the struggling turtle and dragged it onto her board before paddling to shore - which saved the injured sea creature 's life			2
@entity2 ( pictured ) was instructing a stand - up paddleboard class when she saw the turtle in @entity4 , near @entity5 , north of @entity6 ms @entity14 and friend @entity28 ( right ) rescued the turtle , named @entity30 , by dragging it onto a board and paddling to shore ms @entity14 - who runs @entity34 - says she spotted the poor turtle , named @entity30 , tangled in a crab pot near a popular local fishing spot			1
' all of a sudden i seen a float bobbing up and down near the creek mouth then what looked like a fin , ' she told @entity43			0
' i was a little cautious to get closer , in case it was a shark then it came up for a gasp of breath and showed it was a turtle			0
' ms @entity14 called her nearby friend @entity28 over for help			1
' @entity53 , quick @entity54 - we have to rescue this ! ' ms @entity14 recalled yelling			1
' @entity54 and i both decided the only way we were going to save this fella was to launch ourselves at him			0
but the ordeal took half an hour , as the turtle was a fast swimmer - albeit injured			2
' @entity54 and i were n't going anywhere , we were determined to get him as he was struggling more and more for air , ' ms @entity14 said			1
' then he came up for another breath and i dove straight in after him			0
diving very deep , i pulled the attached rope down until i had hold of his huge shell and he continued deeper			0
' all i can remember is looking up and seeing the sun shining on the water above thinking , i 've got to come up for air , then all of a sudden the turtle flew back up to surface for another breath			0
' the two friends will be visiting @entity30 next week , at the @entity79 , which is when he is due to be released @entity80 in the midst of the turtle rescue mission on friday morning ms @entity14 then yelled for her friend to bring the board over as they struggled to hoist the turtle onto the flotation device			1
' we both had a fin each and tried tirelessly to pull him onto board but no go , ' she said			0
' then i decided to jump on board behind him , @entity54 stayed beside the turtle and we waited for a wave			0
as the wave hit us we both tried to haul turtle on bit by bit and centre him			0
we were exhausted , us and the poor turtle			0
it took 15 minutes to try and free @entity30 from the crab pot line he was entangled in			2
' @entity54 and i both looked at each other nearly crying with excitement and both agreed that we could n't let him go , as his fin was damaged pretty bad , ' ms @entity14 said			1
the crab pot ( pictured ) in the local fishing spot that trapped the giant injured turtle so they persisted until they were able to untie him from the line			2
' it was a mission and a half , ' ms @entity14 said			2
' i think everything that i have learnt from board rescue in lifesaving helped me for this , we wiggled the turtle up the board a little and i lay behind our dear friend while @entity54 swam beside the board helping me hold him on			0
' once they hit the shore , the pair covered @entity30 in wet towels and called the @entity130 straight away			2
with the help of several bystanders , they were able to lift the giant turtle onto the back of a ute and drove him to meet rehab staff at the centre in @entity5			1
ms @entity14 says she plans on visiting her turtle friend at the rehabilitation centre next week , which is when he 's due to be released			1
' i guess its something you do n't do every day - but it was very rewarding to be part of something so special , ' she said .			0
