the @entity0 will try to land the @entity1 and end a 28 - year drought without the @entity3			0
which city will it pick ? stay tuned			0
after hearing presentations from the four candidates tuesday — @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 — @entity0 board members voted to join the race , but not until they have a chance to mull over the candidates during the holidays			0
' it 's a four - way tie , ' ceo @entity17 said , not diverging from the federation 's closed - lip policy on this yearlong selection process			0
' we had great presentations , now we have an opportunity to explore how everyone felt about the presentations			0
we 'll reflect , come back after the holidays and see what 's in the best interest for the @entity30			1
' tight - lipped : @entity0 chairman @entity31 ( left ) and @entity0 chief executive officer @entity17 ( right ) address the media in a press conference following the @entity0 board of directors meeting at @entity35 which revealed the @entity30 will vie to host the @entity1			1
they stayed mum on which city would put in the bid this was the expected move from a federation that lost badly the last two times it bid for the @entity44 — @entity45 for 2012 and @entity46 for 2016 — and has n't played host to the @entity48 since the @entity49 in 1996			1
the 2016 olympics are set for @entity51			1
the @entity44 , which the @entity30 did not bid for , will be in @entity52			1
@entity30 's chosen city for 2024 will be up against @entity54 and either @entity55 or @entity56			1
there will be others in the mix , as well , possibly including @entity60 , which is expected to announce its intention soon			1
the games will be awarded in 2017			2
' there are some real good cities lining up , ' said @entity65 , president of @entity66			2
' it 's going to be a tough race			0
it 's important to take the time to make the right decision , to find a city that represents a very bold message			0
' @entity17 said there were no major changes in the decision - making process that stemmed from the @entity78 's @entity77 — an attempt to streamline the bidding process and make the @entity48 less expensive			1
he and chairman @entity31 said there was no move to have two cities combine on a bid — a possibility raised in @entity77			1
all the cities had their mayors or mayor - elects there , along with the bids ' power players			2
they included @entity93 owner @entity92 for @entity10 , agent and media mogul @entity95 for @entity9 , construction magnate @entity96 for @entity8 and @entity98 and @entity99 owner @entity97 for @entity11			0
' four - way tie ' : @entity10 is among the cities vying to host the games			1
the city is one of four in the @entity30 hoping to outbid @entity55 or @entity56 , @entity54 and possibly @entity60 @entity8 also wants to play host to the @entity48 , though a movement in protest of the bid has grown quickly in the city ' we 're not going to leave a bill for future generations , ' @entity8 mayor @entity109 told @entity113 , hammering home a theme of cost - effectiveness that the @entity0 has insisted on from the start of this process			1
also represented was the group @entity120 , the most organized protest group in the four cities , which unfurled a banner outside the meeting place in @entity125 , @entity126			2
the group cited polling data that showed tepid support , along with the secretive process of the domestic selection process , as among the reasons to reject the @entity48			2
@entity17 said the protest groups wo n't scare the @entity0			0
' once we pick a city and the city has more freedom ( to outline details of its bid ) , i think you 'll see opposition decline , ' he said			2
' you 'll see that each bid is fiscally responsible			2
' the cities all came in with projected operating budgets of between $ 4 billion and $ 5 billion , though that cost almost always skyrockets , and does n't include the infrastructure and other @entity149 - related improvements cities make			0
@entity17 said the cities had to show how an @entity48 would fit into their long - term plans — an element the @entity78 also thinks is important as it tries to end the days of billion - dollar roads , stadiums and airports that are only partially used once the @entity48 leave town			1
also important to the @entity30 bid is the @entity0 's reputation overseas			1
@entity17 and @entity31 have spent more than four years traveling the world to repair frayed relations that played into the country 's last two losses			0
' they 've done a tremendous job , ' said @entity166 , ceo of @entity167			0
' they 've been consistent , deliberate , invested in building meaningful relationships			0
where we operate , i think people are noticing there 's a genuine effort to be a contributing member			0
' @entity9 wants to host the games for the third time in 2024 -- having hosted in 1932 as well as 1984			1

the @entity30 cities will be up against @entity55 or @entity56 , @entity54 and possibly @entity60 for the games
the 2016 olympics are set for @entity51 . the @entity44 , which the @entity30 did not bid for , will be in @entity52
the @entity30 has not played host to the @entity48 since @entity185 hosted the games in 1996
