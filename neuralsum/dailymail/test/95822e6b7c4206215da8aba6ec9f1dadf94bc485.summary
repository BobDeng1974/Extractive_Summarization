you could have fried an egg on @entity3 ’s upper lip yesterday afternoon when he appeared in sunny @entity4			1
the pm was speaking in a rather peculiar building – an almost empty science park on the city ’s outskirts , its round atrium area filled with party activists			1
the space was uncomfortably hot and mr @entity3 was looking straight into a merciless , piercing , armpit - moistening sun. the prime ministerial upper lip was soon glistening			1
attack of the sweats ! @entity3 worked up a sweat as he made a visit to @entity19 in @entity20 and sunny @entity4			1
pictured : the prime minister speaks with @entity22 and her daughter @entity24 over lunch in a sun - drenched garden it was such a glorious bank holiday , why on earth did @entity30 high command not scrap their plans , strip down to shirts and chinos and campaign on the beach at @entity38 ? they might at least have found some swing voters there			1
but there is something clinical , immutable , rigid , unspontaneous so far about this @entity30 campaign			1
well , all the parties ’ campaigns , really			2
strategists with precious plans have plotted every minute of every low - risk day and the politicians look more remote from the electors than ever			2
mr @entity3 was appearing alongside @entity52 , chancellor of the exchequer , both of them in weekday suits			1
on some news - management grid many moons ago it had been decided that tax was to be the theme of the day			2
i suppose no one guessed it might be high - summerish weather			2
bank holidays are usually washouts			2
and so tax remained the dish du jour			2
the day was hailed as ‘ money back monday ’ because it was the start of the financial year and the new , more generous tax allowances for the low - paid meant an extra £ 600 in people ’s pockets			2
mr @entity3 had spent the morning in @entity19 , @entity20 ( where veteran @entity74 mp @entity73 is retiring ) and apparently ate a hot dog while he was there			1
one of the reporters who had been on his campaign bus said he had met ‘ at least two voters ’			0
he arrived at the @entity4 and @entity79 at 4.40pm			1
as his battle bus approached the destination , one of his police bodyguards made plain his feelings by being spectacularly sick , poor soul			0
perhaps the copper had been food taster for the hot dog			0
everyone getting off the bus looked a bit green			0
the audience had been waiting for some time , broiling slowly in the building ’s atrium			0
what a soulless place it was , of antiseptic design with bleached wood and long , lifeless corridors			0
an airport - style exterior			0
we could have been anywhere in the world – the middle of @entity107 , the plains of central @entity109 , or at a yet - to - open business hotel in @entity111			0
prime minister @entity3 and @entity52 make a speech at the @entity4 and @entity79 during his @entity4 visit , mr @entity3 read a speech and said there was a ‘ moral ’ case for the @entity117 ’ policies @entity4 has a handful of seats , local @entity30 mps being @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
might it not have made more sense to hold a rally underneath @entity128 suspension bridge – somewhere that at least had a resonance with the city ? a tanned mr @entity3 dutifully made his prepared speech , saying that there was a ‘ moral ’ case for the @entity117 ’ economic policies			1
fetch that , mr archbishop of @entity137			0
it was ‘ frankly immoral to spend money like it grows on trees ’			0
he said he and the @entity117 would spend money on ‘ your family , your future ’ rather than on ‘ bureaucracy or bloat or the latest crackpot government scheme ’			0
this innovative use of ‘ bloat ’ as a noun was repeated three times			0
maybe it should be their new slogan			0
after ten minutes he let @entity52 make a speech			1
@entity52 stepped into the glare and you have seldom seen a man look so deathly pale			1
shades of the sepulchre on @entity164 morning			0
a brief session of questions saw mr @entity3 being asked about recent @entity74 eruptions – @entity168 calling mr @entity52 ‘ a very dangerous man ’ and @entity170 alleging that the @entity117 are not interested in helping the poor			1
mr @entity3 said it was inevitable that ‘ you ’ll find the minor parties saying increasingly desperate things ’			1
he was unfazed by ‘ the odd noise - off from a deputy ’			0
or should that be noise - off from an odd deputy ?			0

@entity3 *enjoyed* visit to @entity4 with chancellor @entity52
visited @entity4 and @entity79 and *earlier* went to @entity19 in @entity20
