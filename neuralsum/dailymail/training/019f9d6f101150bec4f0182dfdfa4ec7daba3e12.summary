too much : most @entity0 will unwittingly take in an astonishing 7000 calories on christmas day with less than three weeks to go until @entity3 , the countdown is on to ensure gifts , food and drink are ready to go come the big day			1
but the endless supply of chocolates , snacks , mince pies and festive drinks has a hefty downside , with the average @entity13 likely to gain 6lbs in the eight days between @entity14 and @entity15			1
unsurprisingly , the worst day for calorie consumption is @entity3 day itself when most us unwittingly consume a shocking 7000 calories - and hit the recommended daily allowance before sitting down to @entity3 dinner			2
according to new research , by 2.08pm , most of us will have consumed our daily calorie allowance ( 2000 kcals for women , 2500kcals for men )			0
starting with a 135 - calorie celebratory breakfast of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs , the gluttonous day usually ends with two mince pies - another 460 calories			1
but although @entity3 lunch has the highest calorie count , the real pitfall is snacking with abundant chocolate , nuts and biscuits heaping on thousands of extra calories			2
despite the healthy turkey , a full @entity3 lunch with all the trimmings is equivalent to 1,450 calories with pudding , complete with custard and brandy butter , adds another 1,174 on top			1
weighty effort : a chart showing how calorie consumption stacks up over the course of @entity3 day and the weighty cost of @entity3 lunch has n't gone unnoticed with one in eight @entity0 people admitting to wanting to slim down in advance			0
the research also found that over a third ( 35 per cent ) said they would like to be 7lbs to 1 stone 7lbs lighter than they currently are			0
however , it appears that when it comes to shifting the extra pounds gained , yo - yo dieting still reigns supreme , with nearly two thirds ( 65 per cent ) of those that had tried at least one weight loss programme finding that they either did not lose any weight or have piled it all back on since			0
calorific : a roast with all the trimmings is equivalent to 1,450 calories while seconds will add another 725 @entity70 , spokesperson at @entity71 commented , ‘ with the numerous parties and desire to look good in our best outfit , @entity3 is a key time for people to think about their weight			1
' it ’s easy to go overboard during the festive season and eat indulgently with all the temptations on offer , but there ’s no reason why you ca n’t have a bit of what you fancy without worrying about the waistline			0
' with some careful preparation in the run up to @entity3 , it ’s easy to change your eating habits and by paying attention to ourselves through a combination of a wholesome diet and improved levels of exercise , we can set ourselves up for longer term health gains			0

come from *alcohol* and snacking on nuts , chocolate and mince pies
a plate of turkey with all the trimmings adds up to 1,450 calories
