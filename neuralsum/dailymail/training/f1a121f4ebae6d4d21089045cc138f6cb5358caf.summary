by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 10 may 2013 a man born without a left hand has had his new terminator - style bionic arm redesigned so he can proudly wear his wedding ring			1
@entity5 , 31 , was fitted with the latest carbon - fibre mechanical hand , which moves like a real human hand , seven months ago			1
the @entity9 hand responds through electrodes to muscle twitches on his upper arm and allows him to do everyday tasks like holding on to tube trains like any ordinary commuter			1
@entity5 is thrilled that he can now wear his wedding ring on his specially - adapted bionic limb			1
the limb is so advanced he can even grip objects by twitching his muscles but @entity5 , married for six years to wife @entity22 , 28 , found his wedding ring kept slipping off the £ 10,000 space - age prosthetic			1
he asked the manufacturers to redesign the prosthetic lower arm and they dismantled it and fitted the ring			2
they removed a portion of the gold and then moulded it to the same shape as the prosthetic finger and tested it before strapping it back on to @entity5 on thursday			2
the delighted father - of - two , from @entity35 , in @entity36 , now has the ring permanently on his false finger - even when he takes off the attachment			0
engineers removed a portion of the gold and then moulded it to the same shape as the prosthetic finger and tested it before strapping it back on he said : ' it feels great to be wearing my wedding ring again - it 's really special			1
' it is nice for both my wife and i that i am able to wear it again and show the commitment we made to each other			1
' it also takes away the slightly menacing look of the bionic hand			0
' i used to wear a prosthetic that i could fit my ring over , but the new hand is smooth so my ring would just fall off			2
' it felt amazing to be able to do so many things which are normal for most people			0
but the fact i could n't wear my wedding ring was a downside			1
@entity5 said it is nice to is able to wear the ring properly because it shows the commitment he made to wife of six years @entity22 ( left ) @entity5 is pictured with his wife @entity22 on their wedding day			1
until ow he had to wear his ring on his right hand because it kept falling off his false , left ring finger ' we mentioned this in passing to the manufacturers and were thrilled when they said they 'd try to sort something out			2
they did a great job of it			0
' @entity5 tried various different prosthetic hands - some cosmetic focused and some mechanical - for 20 years after being born with no left hand			1
he was approached by @entity93 seven months ago and asked if he would like to trial their latest hand - the most high - tech available in the world			0
@entity5 was approached by the @entity98 seven months ago to trial their hi - tech hand the hand is made of aluminium and alloy and is so sensitive @entity5 can even hold a piece of paper and double click a mouse he controls the arm by sending signals from his brain to the muscles in his lower arm , which are detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 preprogrammed grips , mirroring human movements			1
the hand , with aluminium and alloy knuckles , is so sensitive @entity5 can now hold a piece of paper and double click a mouse with it			0
he is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a trial , which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made widely available on the @entity129			0
he added : ' my hand is pretty cool - it is like something from @entity134			0
' i 'd tried a series of prosthethics before , but they were all quite cumbersome			0
the father - of - three said the chance to trial the futuristic hand was ' amazing ' but not being able to wear his ring had been a ' real downside '			2
after the minor tweaks made by engineers he is now able to show his love for his wife openly @entity148 , product manager at @entity149 who manufacture the hands , said : " when @entity5 first trialled the hand , we encouraged him to undergo numerous tests in a variety of everyday situations			1
this included using it on the crowded tube during rush hour , typing on a computer , making a sandwich and using a kindle			0
by and large , everything went to plan			0
' what we had n't accounted for was the wedding ring			2
it was a pleasure to solvethe problem			0

@entity5 , 31 , had to wear wedding ring on his right hand because it kept slipping off his state - of - the - art £ 10,000 carbon - fibre electric model
the prosthetic limb is so advanced it responds to twitches in his upper arm
@entity5 says is pleased he can now show commitment to wife @entity22 , 28
he is also pleased ring fits because it makes his hand look ' less menacing '
