by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:39 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:56 est , 11 december 2013 a giant human - made landform in the heart of @entity5 has scooped a global lanscape award , beating off competition from @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity10 , dubbed the ' @entity10 ' , is the world 's largest landsculptre and is embedded into the hills of @entity14 in the @entity15			2
the public park is built in the shape of a reclining lady lying on the hillside			1
finished in 2012 , the site , which is managed by independent charity @entity44 , has already been visited by more than 100,000 people			0
the construction came about as part of the development of an adjacent open - cast coal mine at @entity50			0
it was decided that rather than returning the material excavated back to the surface near the mine , something creative should be done with the soil and clay			0
the hills have eyes : from the perspective of the face of the valley , walkers look down to sweeping curves of the structure swirling beauty : the formation , which cost around £ 3m to create , was funded by local energy firm @entity68 built by regional property and energy firm the @entity68 and the @entity71 , the site has now been awarded with the @entity73 category in the @entity74 @entity75 , communications manager at @entity76 , said : ' winning this global award provides a wonderful finale to a fantastic first full year for @entity10			1
the quality of the landform 's design and construction , and the cultural , community and tourism impact that she 's having have been widely recognised by both a range of awards and the tens of thousands of people who 've already been to visit her			0
' the projects against which @entity10 was competing for this award represent the very best in landscape architecture around the world , so this award is a real coup for both everyone involved with the project and @entity15 as a whole			1
brow of the hill : the cultural landmark has won the @entity73 category in the @entity74 locally sourced : the destination took two and a half years to construct using 1.5 million tonnes of stone , clay and soil from @entity68 ' adjacent @entity107 ' being in this sort of spotlight provides a great platform for the region , as well as for @entity10 herself , and we hope it will lead to even more visitors coming to the @entity15 to take a look at everything that 's on offer here			2
' @entity119 , chief executive of @entity71 , added : ' everyone involved in @entity10 is delighted to receive this international award to add to the regional and national prizes already awarded			0
' @entity71 is privileged to be part of this project which is now gaining recognition as a unique landscape and arts project as well as a gateway to the rest of @entity5 , while enhancing the leisure facilities available to the local community			0
' face of nature : last year , more than 100,000 people visited the site to roam the man - made hills vast : the public park , dubbed the ' @entity10 ' is 34 metres 112 feet high and 400 metres long			1
