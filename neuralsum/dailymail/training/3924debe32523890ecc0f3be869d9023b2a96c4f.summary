delegates from several other countries , including @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , also walked out while @entity1 was still talking			0
according to @entity2 media , the article in @entity32 said : ' the @entity2 government has professed on the tongue of its president @entity1 that it does not believe that @entity5 was behind 9/11 but rather , the @entity7 government			2
' so we may ask the question : why would @entity2 ascribe to such a ridiculous belief that stands in the face of all logic and evidence ?

in a speech full of questions which were no more than thinly veiled attacks on the @entity7 he asked the @entity22 who had used the ' mysterious september 11 incident ' as a precursor to war and to dominate the @entity73 ? he added : ' by using their imperialistic media network which is under the influence of colonialism they threaten anyone who questions the @entity80 and the september 11 event with sanctions and military actions , ' he said			1
