militants fighting for the @entity1 in @entity2 and @entity3 are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in @entity9 's army			1

almost all of the regional commanders appointed by @entity11 ' leader and self - declared caliph , @entity24 , played prominent roles in the @entity27 army before the 2003 invasion of @entity3 and became involved with @entity11 either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator 's 2006 execution			2
influence : despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the @entity14 extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos , @entity11 ' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of @entity9 ( pictured ) militants : almost all the highly secretive officials overseeing the day - to - day running of the @entity1 ( pictured ) are former members of @entity9 's @entity27 army one of the most prominent former @entity19 army generals within @entity11 was @entity39 ( left ) who led the terrorists ' operations in @entity3 until he was killed in an @entity44 airstrike last november			1
@entity45 ( right ) , a former colonel in @entity19 @entity47 intelligence now plays a leading role in @entity11 ' military council one former @entity2 rebel who became an @entity11 regional commander told the @entity52 that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group 's day - to - day business were ex members of @entity9 's @entity27 army			1
during one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an @entity11 meeting , the man calling himself @entity60 was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room , listening and taking notes			0
although the enigmatic commander 's real name was never revealed to him , @entity60 said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the @entity19 army before joining @entity11			0
the same went for the other @entity11 commanders @entity60 met , who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of @entity9 's army			2
as well as their extensive military expertise , another key element of the commanders ' appointments has been the fact the ex-baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to @entity9 's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s			1
crucially , oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of @entity11 ' £ 2 billion - a - year income			1
leader : almost all of the regional commanders appointed by @entity11 ' leader and self - declared caliph , @entity24 ( pictured ) , played prominent roles in the @entity27 army before the 2003 invasion of @entity3 experience : former @entity19 @entity103 colonel @entity102 ( left ) was @entity104 's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of @entity2 rebels in january 2014			1
pictured right is @entity111 - a former @entity27 soldier and now an @entity11 military council member the former @entity103 generals ' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to @entity11 ' £ 2 billion - a - year income @entity118 analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former @entity19 army commanders have joined @entity11 is due to the @entity123 law brought in l. ­ @entity124 - the @entity44 who served as temporary head of the @entity19 state following the ousting of @entity9			1
the law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated @entity19 army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions			2
many of these highly - trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid- 2000s , which was dominated by @entity11 who at the time were known by the name @entity141 in @entity3			2
when @entity24 took control of the group in 2010 , many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the @entity14 tribes who dominate @entity3 and who have been largely ignored by the country 's @entity153 - led @entity152 government			2
the process had , however been started by @entity104 's predecessor @entity156 who was himself a former @entity19 army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the @entity159 criminal , former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded @entity11 , @entity163			0
past : the process of giving former @entity19 commanders senior roles was started by @entity24 's predecessor @entity156 ( left ) who was a former @entity19 army officer and therefore more trusted than the @entity159 criminal , former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded @entity11 , @entity163 ( right ) heartbreaking : the highest estimate for the number of recruits killed in the @entity175 massacre is about 1,700 discovery : the graves were found last wednesday on the @entity179 's presidential compound one of the most prominent former @entity19 army generals within @entity11 was @entity181 , who used the code name @entity39 , and was in charge of all the terrorists ' operations in @entity3 until he was killed in an @entity44 airstrike last november			1
he had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in @entity9 's @entity188			2
other senior figures include @entity190 , who currently acts as @entity192 's deputy leader in @entity2 and is a former military general in @entity9 's @entity103 , and @entity45 , a former colonel in @entity19 @entity47 intelligence and now plays a leading role in @entity11 ' military council			1
less prominent militants with an @entity103 backgrounds include @entity111 - a former @entity27 soldier and now an @entity11 military council member , @entity199 - a former @entity19 officer and now in charge of @entity11 suicide bombers and foreign fighters			0
another former @entity19 @entity103 colonel was @entity102 , who is widely considered to have been @entity104 's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the @entity211 in january 2014			0
it is widely believed that all of the senior @entity11 figures killed over the past year - including @entity102 - have been replaced by former members of the @entity103			0
horror : images like this one of the soldiers being led through @entity218 shocked @entity3 and the world this morning @entity19 forensic teams in the newly liberated city of @entity218 have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by @entity11 last year			0
@entity225 , from @entity3 's @entity226 , said the work on eight locations started yesterday inside @entity218 's complex of presidential palaces , where much of the killing is thought to have occured			0
@entity11 overran @entity9 's hometown last june , capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee @entity175 , an air base previously used by @entity44 troops on the outskirt of @entity218			1
the fall of @entity218 was part of the @entity11 onslaught that stunned @entity19 security forces and the military , which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country 's north and west			0
later , @entity248 posted graphic images online that showed gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after forcing them to lay face - down in a ditch with their arms tied behind their backs			0
after weeks of bitter clashes , @entity19 forces and allied @entity153 militias , succeeded in retaking @entity218 from @entity11			0
their victory was helped by @entity44 - led coalition airstrikes .			0

@entity11 leadership is dominated by former members of @entity9 's @entity103
many joined the terror group in the insurgency after the fall of the dictator
@entity44 had barred the men taking government jobs or drawing their pensions
generals ' military experience has been key to the terrorists ' *spread* in @entity3
their connections with oil smugglers also help isis raise £ 2 billion a year
