not happy : @entity0 expects better from @entity1 when they reach @entity3 @entity1 boss @entity0 is expecting better from his side as they head off to @entity3 for the @entity6			1
the @entity7 played out a lacklustre 2 - 0 win against an under - strength @entity10 side in @entity12 in their final friendly before the tournament on wednesday			1
the result rarely seemed in doubt , with goals in each half from @entity20 and @entity21 securing the victory , but @entity10 had plenty of possession and frustrated their hosts for long spells			1
@entity1 's next match will be against champions @entity28 in their @entity6 opener in @entity31 a week on friday and @entity32 knows improvement is necessary			1
' i hoped they would play better , ' @entity32 said			0
' we played a lot of unnecessary balls , i believe , and there was too much possession of the opponent , @entity10			2
' we did n't get the pressure on the ball because they made the pitch very big and when they are in trouble , played a long ball			0
' it is always very difficult to play against those teams			0
' @entity32 again changed his formation for the game			0
the incoming @entity54 boss ditched the country 's traditional 4 - 3 - 3 system for 5 - 3 - 2 for the recent friendlies against @entity58 and @entity59 but played 4 - 4 - 2 , incorporating a midfield diamond , against @entity10			1
@entity32 believes it is necessary to try out different approaches to ensure options are available to combat the varying tactics of their @entity66 rivals			0
wales were chosen as opponents in the hope they could provide a test similar to the one the @entity7 will face against @entity72 in their second group game on june 18			0
@entity1 also face @entity75 in the tournament			2
@entity32 said : ' we scored two beautiful goals but it must be better			0
double act : @entity21 and @entity20 scored as @entity1 edged out @entity10 in a friendly ' previously i was able to play 4 - 3 - 3 , and we might have played more attractive , but i wanted to see the benefits of the other system			1
' against @entity28 and @entity75 , i think i 'm going to play 5 - 3 - 2			2
the 4 - 4 - 2 is less promising			2
' @entity1 left for @entity3 with a slight fitness concern over leading striker @entity85 , who suffered a groin injury and was withdrawn as a precaution at half - time			1
both player and manager stressed the problem was not serious but the 30 - year - old was due to be assessed by the team doctor			0
@entity94 was also due to travel with the squad despite a hamstring injury that looks likely to rule him out of the @entity28 game			0
worry : @entity85 suffered a knock in @entity1 's win			1

@entity1 *stuttered* to a 2 - 0 win over an under - strength @entity10 side
@entity0 has been *experimenting* with his formation
@entity85 suffered a worrying injury
