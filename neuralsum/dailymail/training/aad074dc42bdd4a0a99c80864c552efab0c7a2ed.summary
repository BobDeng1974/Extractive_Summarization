when @entity2 schoolgirl @entity1 was ordered off the train at @entity4 in 1944 , she was destined for death in the gas chambers - along with all the others considered too young or too old to work			1
but instead of being killed , @entity1 , not long in her teens , managed to convince ' @entity10 ' doctor @entity9 she was older and fit to work			1
almost 70 years after she gave one of the most reviled @entity15 the slip , the story of the @entity13 teenager - now a celebrated artist - is to be told for the first time in a new book			1
@entity1 , pictured here during the war , was given hard labour instead of being gassed at @entity4 after convincing @entity9 - the ' @entity10 ' - that she was ' fit to work ' @entity21 , as she is now known , went on to become a famous artist in the @entity13 @entity9 would hold the power of life and death over the @entity2 sent to the camp - sending the weakest off to the left and unwittingly into the gas chambers where they would meet their end			1
the strongest would go to the right for forced labour but survival			1
although the other children were killed , @entity1 was spared by the @entity36 officer , who sent her to a work camp			1
his snap decision saved her life , and at the end of the war she was freed			2
miss @entity1 , who went on to become a famous artist in the @entity13 , and is now in her 80s , will have her war memoirs published around the world			1
she kept a diary jotted down in school exercise books of her time spent in concentration camps during the war			2
death camp : the main entrance to @entity4			2
schoolgirl @entity1 managed to persuade @entity9 to save her			1
the writing over the gate ' arbeit macht frei ' says ' work sets you free ' as prisoners arrived at @entity4 , notorious doctor @entity9 ( pictured ) would sort them - ushering the strongest to the right and the weakest to the left to their deaths			2
those who were not fit for work - because they were not physically fit , were too young or too old - were sent to the gas chambers immediately			2
historians have told harrowing stories of how he sentenced a block of 750 people to death when he discovered there was an outbreak of lice in their block			2
but although @entity9 had the power of life and death over all the new arrivals , it was his grim experiments that gave him notoriety			2
he would amputate limbs , sterilise prisoners and give them shock therapy			0
those who did n't die during surgery would be killed by infection or put to death			0
the sheer barbarity of his actions has made him one of the most infamous characters in @entity89			0
but when the @entity89 fell in 1945 he escaped to @entity90 and lived on until 1979			0
the book , @entity92 - sold to publishers at the @entity95 book fair - has been likened to the diary of @entity97			0
it will come out in @entity99 next year			0
after persuading the death camp officer to save her , miss @entity1 moved back to her home city of @entity102 after the war			1
although she found fame with her artwork , her war diaries were little known			0
@entity1 was sent to live in a ghetto by the @entity15 in @entity108 , @entity109 , at the start of the diary which begins in 1939			1
she tells the story of her grim life - and how freedom was gradually curtailed before she was shipped off to @entity4 with her mother in 1944			0
@entity1 - who is now married and uses the surname @entity21 - told the @entity117 during a visit to @entity119 last year that life under the @entity15 got progressively worse before she was shipped off to the death camp			1
' one thing after another was forbidden : employees lost their jobs , we were banned from the parks , swimming pools , sports clubs			0
' i was banned from going to school when i was 10 , ' she said			0
' i was always asking my parents , " what 's happening ? " , and became angry at them if i thought they were trying to hide something , to protect me			0
' she arrived at @entity4 on october 4 , 1944 , where dr @entity9 was deciding who to kill and who should be given labour			0
after tricking the reviled doctor into thinking she was old enough to work , @entity1 was sent to @entity141 where she was forced to work			1
of around 15,000 children from @entity108 sent to @entity4 , it is believe between 150 and 1,500 survived			0
although @entity1 has admitted in the past that she kept a war journal , it had never been published before			1
@entity92 ( published by @entity147 ) is out on june 7 next year			0
