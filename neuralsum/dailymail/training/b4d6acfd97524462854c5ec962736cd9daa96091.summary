the @entity1 's smallest chapel is believed to have been found - purely by chance			2
the seven - foot - wide and 10 - foot - long building is believed to date back to the eighth or ninth century			1
but @entity4 did not know he was the owner until he was painstakingly restoring @entity5 in @entity6 , near @entity7 , north @entity8 , which he bought 20 years ago			1
tiny discovery : @entity4 found the tiny chapel when he was tidying up land near @entity7 in north wales the 66 - year - old was clearing rubble away from a bank when he was astonished to discover the ancient , tiny place of worship buried low down near the house in @entity6 , near @entity7 , north @entity8			1
and he believes it could even be the ' lost ' @entity20 of @entity21 , whose precise location has been a mystery to archaeologists for years			1
mr @entity4 said : ' it took a while to get people round here to see it , but [ historic monuments body ] @entity30 have been to inspect it and said it is one of the best preserved chapels they have ever seen			2
they have made it a designated ancient monument			0
' we think it dates back to the eighth or ninth century			1
' the house was built in 1420 and would have been built at ground level at that time			0
history mystery : building could be ' lost ' @entity20 of @entity21 , whose location has been debated for years ' the chapel has been built at a level a lot lower than that			1
' the property had been burned down before i bought it 20 years ago and i 've been restoring it			2
the chapel had been buttressed in on either side , so the first i saw of it was the roof at floor level and thought it was a really strange structure			0
' i knew it was important , special , religious , with a deeper meaning			0
i see myself as a custodian , to make sure it is n't damaged , and want it saved for another 600 years			0
' mr @entity4 said he is ready to invite the public to view the chapel			0
he said : ' i want it to be sympathetically used , so if a practising @entity65 group want to hold services here , or anyone wants to visit , they can get in contact - i am happy to share , as long as they let me know they are coming beforehand			0
' details about the @entity20 of @entity72 are vague			1
according to the @entity79 project website , as far back as 1254 , one of the clergy who assessed the parishes of the @entity76 for taxation was one ' @entity81 '			2
prayer space : mr @entity4 says he is happy for people to hold religious services in the seven - foot - wide chapel it is only through documentary evidence that anything is known at all about the medieval chapel of @entity20 's ; the precise site of the building is still a mystery and the extant documents give very few clues , but it is believed to have been located on the west bank of the @entity97			1
the last mention of the chapel in the public records was in 1507 where it is apparently referred to as in ' @entity102 ' , and near the @entity97			0
@entity103 , of the @entity79 and @entity104 , said : ' we have done 13 years of research on that land and all the documents tend to put @entity20 's where @entity110 's chapel is , so it could be associated with it , have some connection , but possibly not be the actual chapel itself			1
' it is certainly medieval so the dates are in line			0
' two other churches that have previously claimed the distinction of being the @entity1 's smallest chapel are @entity123 's in @entity124 on @entity125 and @entity126 in @entity127 .			0
