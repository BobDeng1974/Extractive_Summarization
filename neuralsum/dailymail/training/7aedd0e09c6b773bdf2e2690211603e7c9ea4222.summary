in 2006 , @entity0 lost its status as a planet when other bodies in the solar system of similar or greater size were found			1
the decision to demote it to a ‘ dwarf planet ’ by the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) at the time was highly contentious - and it now seems many still want its planet status reinstated			1
in a debate where experts presented cases for and against the decision , it was found that most people in the audience still wanted @entity0 to be a planet			1
in a debate held last week at the @entity21 in @entity22 most people still wanted @entity0 to be a planet			2
three experts gave their arguments for and against @entity0 being a planet and audience members then gave their decision - with most wanting @entity0 to still be a planet ( shown ) the debate was held last week at the @entity21 for astrophysics in @entity32 , @entity22			1
during the event three experts explained their own reasoning for thinking @entity0 was or was n’t a planet reports @entity36			0
and the audience members were then asked to vote on which argument they thought was best			1
according to the @entity8 , a cosmic body must satisfy three conditions before it can be classified as a planet			0
the first is that it must be in orbit around the sun , and not be the satellite of another planet			0
second , it must have sufficient mass to form a spherical shape under its own gravity			0
and finally it must have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit			0
the latter was the condition that lost @entity0 its planet status			2
this is because it orbits in the @entity59 at the outer edge of the solar system , where many other icy rocks and worlds orbit in its vicinity			0
dr @entity65 of the @entity66 defended the original @entity8 decision in 2006 and said @entity0 should not be a planet as it had not cleared the path in its orbit - one of the prerequisites for a planet , as decided in 2006			0
science historian dr @entity73 argued that , for historical and cultural reasons , @entity0 should be a planet			0
and dr @entity76 , director of the @entity77 agreed with dr @entity73 , but for the reason that any lump of matter large enough to form a sphere around a star should be classified as a planet			0
when put to the vote , the majority of the audience - which consisted of experts and members of the general public - agreed with dr @entity76 , who ’s definition would also help classify exoplanets			2
the vote is n't official , although it does highlight the continued public disapproval of @entity0 being demoted			1
however , if @entity0 was still a planet it would cause a number of complications			0
namely , several other bodies of a similar or greater size such as @entity101 and @entity102 were found , and it is estimated there may be hundreds more @entity0 - sized objects in the outer solar system			1
reinstating @entity0 , therefore , could ultimately lead to our solar system not being a small family of eight easily identifiable planets , but a complicated system of dozens of obscure worlds extending far beyond the orbit of @entity113			2
in july 2015 , @entity114 will become the first spacecraft ever to visit @entity0 ( illustration shown )			1
in 2006 @entity0 lost its status as a planet when other bodies of a similar size were found in the solar system			1
had it remained a planet , the family of planets in the solar system would likely have to be expanded to several dozen the latest vote is n't official , but highlights the public continued disapproval of @entity0 's demotion to ' dwarf planet ' status			1
shown here is the most detailed view to date of the entire surface of the dwarf planet @entity0 as constructed from multiple @entity137 photographs taken from 2002 to 2003			2

@entity0 lost its status as a planet in 2006 when other bodies of a similar size were found in the solar system
last week , during a debate at the @entity147 , people voted to reinstate its planet status
three experts gave their arguments for and against @entity0 being a planet
audience members then voted on which argument they thought was best
the vote is n't official , but highlights the public continued disapproval of @entity0 's demotion to ' dwarf planet ' status
in july , the @entity114 craft will become the first *mission* to visit @entity0
