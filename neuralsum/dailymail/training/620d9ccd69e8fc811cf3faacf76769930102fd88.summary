by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 04:36 est , 5 november 2013 an honest builder who handed in nearly £ 18,000 in cash to police after he found it stashed in a fire - damaged flat will go without any reward following a high court judge 's ruling			2
@entity9 found the hoard of ' neatly bundled ' notes in a metal box in a burnt - out property he was renovating in @entity14 , @entity15 , in september 2011			1
the £ 17,940 cash haul - all in £ 20 notes and neatly packaged into £ 1,000 bundles - was concealed under a kitchen unit			1
the flat had been empty since a fire gutted it six months earlier and mr @entity9 immediately handed in his find to police			2
but a high court judge has ruled mr @entity9 does not have any right to the cash after police failed to trace its origins			1
honest : builder @entity9 found nearly £ 18,000 in £ 20 notes hidden in a burnt - out property he was renovating in @entity15 and handed it in to police ' mr @entity9 is an honest man , ' noted mr @entity35 , who added : ' he took the find , as any honest person would , to the police			1
' police experts and forensic analysts examined the mysterious hoard			0
drug - testing was , however , ' inconclusive ' , although some notes showed minute traces of cocaine			0
magistrates nevertheless ordered forfeiture of the cash under the @entity49 after @entity51 's chief constable , @entity50 , successfully argued that it probably came from ' unlawful criminal conduct '			2
that decision was later confirmed at @entity55			0
ruling : @entity9 challenged the forfeiture of the cash under the @entity49 after the origin of the money was never discovered but a high court judge ruled the money should be confiscated mr @entity9 , who was left without a penny from his find even though no - one else had laid claim to the cash , challenged the money 's forfeiture at the @entity67 , insisting there was no evidence to link it to the criminal underworld			1
however , mr justice @entity35 said the careful sorting of the notes into bundles of one denomination meant they were ' unlikely to be the profits of legitimate cash trading '			0
the fact that the cash had been hidden and never reclaimed was also suspicious			0
the judge left mr @entity9 with only a tribute to his honesty as he backed the money 's forfeiture to the public purse			1
' in my judgment the crown court was entitled to infer that the money was obtained by unlawful conduct of an unidentifiable kind , ' he concluded .			0
