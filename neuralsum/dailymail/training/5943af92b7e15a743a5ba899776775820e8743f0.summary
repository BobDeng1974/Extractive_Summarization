a young girl , rejected by an ancient community , was said to have been buried face down to prevent her spirit from rising from the grave at just 13 years of age			1
that 's the verdict of archaeologists who discovered the child 's skeleton near a church in northern @entity11			2
they believe she was considered dangerous in the early part of the @entity15 , perhaps due to her pale complexion , or because she had a blood disorder that caused her to faint regularly			1
a young girl , rejected by an ancient community , was said to have been buried ( remains pictured ) face down to prevent her spirit from rising from the grave at just 13 years old			1
experts believe she was considered dangerous in the @entity15 , perhaps because of her pale complexion or blood disorder the remains were discovered by a team of archaeologists from the @entity28 of @entity29 at the @entity30 , at the complex of @entity32 in @entity33 on the @entity34 , @entity11 , @entity24 reported			1
the burial ground was abandoned in 1593 and the girl ’s remains are estimated to date from the early @entity15 , but have not yet been radiocarbon dated			1
excavation director , @entity39 , explained that so - called ' prone ' burials - when people are buried face down - are usually a punishment intended to humiliate the deceased and stop them from rising from the grave			1
this has led to the @entity11 media referring to the young girl as a witch - although these claims have not been verified			1
the remains were discovered by a team of archaeologists from the @entity28 of @entity29 at the @entity30 , at the complex of @entity32 in @entity33 ( marked on the map ) on the @entity34 , @entity11 prone burials are when an individual is buried face - down			1
sometimes people were also buried alive looking downwards into the earth			0
archaeologists have excavated over 600 bodies buried in this way across the world , and @entity63 is the hotspot - with over 200 prone burials , @entity29 reported			2
@entity66 , of @entity68 's @entity67 conducted a large study to find similarities between prone burials			0
she found that the earliest known case of prone burial is 26,000 years ago in the @entity73 , while the most recent is thought to be a first world war grave			2
collections of prone graves have been found in @entity77 - particularly during @entity79 and @entity80 periods , in @entity81 and @entity82 and in @entity83			2
while there are instances where people buried in a prone position were treated normally , some experts think the burial was used as a humiliating punishment			1
anthropologist @entity91 said : ‘ the prone burial was linked to the belief that the soul left the body through the mouth			0
burying the dead face - down was a way to prevent the impure soul threatening the living			2

' burying the dead face - down was a way to prevent the impure soul threatening the living			2
’ the ultimate punishment was being buried alive face - down , but in this instance it seems the girl avoided this fate because of the position of her limbs			1
they show no signs of struggling or a violent death			0
dr @entity91 noticed that the skeleton has spongy bone tissue on the skull , likely from severe anaemia			0
‘ she could have suffered from an inherited blood disorder such as thalassemia or from haemorrhagic conditions			1
' more simply , it could have been an diet lacking in iron ’ she explained			0
@entity124 is a form of inherited blood disorder that originated in the @entity128 region			1
it 's caused by the weakening of red blood cells and people with the disorder suffer from severe anaemia , bone deformities and heart problems			0
they also tend to be short , similar to the girl whose skeleton was discovered			0
it could be that the young girl , who was just 5ft tall , scared her community because of her pale colouring , possible haematomas - the collection of blood outside the blood vessels , usually in liquid form within the tissue - and fainting			2
the find is particularly unusual because she was buried just in front of a church			2
dr @entity39 said that a similar burial of a teenage was found in front of a church in @entity156 near @entity157 , @entity11			1
prone burials are relatively unusual			0
the earliest known burial of this time was done 26,000 years ago and occurred as recently as the last century			0
@entity66 of @entity68 's @entity67 believes that prone burials are a deep - seated conscious act that can be seen across different cultures and religions			0
spongy bones indicate that the girl may have suffered from an inherited blood disorder such as thalassemia or from haemorrhagic conditions			1
this might have caused her to faint and be very pale			0
this could have convinced superstitious locals in the @entity15 to stay away from her			0
blood from a patient with thalassemia is pictured			0

13 - year - old was buried face down in the @entity15 , experts believe
this type of burial was considered a humiliating punishment for an outsider

remains were found in @entity33 on the @entity34 , @entity11
