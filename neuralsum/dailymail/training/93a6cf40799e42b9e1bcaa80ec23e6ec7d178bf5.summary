microwaves are great for heating food in a hurry , but what happens if you need to cool , or even , freeze food just as quick ? that ’s where the @entity7 comes in			1
the @entity7 works like a traditional microwave , but when the @entity11 switch is pressed pressurised @entity13 floods the chamber and surrounds what ’s inside			2
depending on how long the switch is pressed for , the food and drinks are either cooled down or frozen completely			2
depending on how long the switch is pressed for , the food and drinks are either cooled down , or frozen completely ( pictured ) it was designed by @entity24 from @entity25 and was recently crowned the winning entry in this year ’s @entity27			1
ms @entity24 won £ 5,001 and beat off competition from the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			2
dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide that has a surface temperature of -78.5 ° @entity35 )			1
as it breaks down , it turns into carbon dioxide gas rather than a liquid and this can be used to keep food frozen , or at least cold , for long periods			1
the @entity7 was fitted with two carbon dioxide canisters			1
these canisters were connected to actuators that were linked to the @entity11 switch			0
tubes from the canisters were then drilled into the back of the microwave			0
when the switch is flicked , the actuator activates the canisters and the carbon dioxide is blasted onto the food or drink			1
the annual competition is run by @entity56 - a firm that specialises in flavoured spirits - and judges included inventor and @entity62 star @entity61 , tv presenter @entity63 plus votes from the public			1
mr @entity61 then built a prototype @entity7 - also known as the @entity66 - to demonstrate its capability			1
he fitted a regular microwave with two carbon dioxide canisters			1
these canisters were connected to actuators that were linked to the @entity11 switch			0
tubes from the canisters were then drilled into the back of the microwave			0
when the switch is flicked , the actuator activates the canisters and the carbon dioxide is blasted onto the food or drink			1
during a demonstration , liquid inside a metal tin began to freeze within minutes , but mr @entity61 joked that to freeze it fully would ' probably take about half an hour ' using the prototype			2

@entity62 star @entity61 then built a prototype model - also known as the @entity66 - to demonstrate its capability ms @entity24 said : ‘ i was sitting at home on a hot day and had a light bulb moment when it came to the @entity66			1
‘ winning £ 5,001 and actually having my invention made is incredible , and hopefully it ’s the start of an @entity66 revolution ! ’ runner up @entity99 from @entity100 , who invented the @entity29 , said : ‘ i ’m proud my invention came out top among the boys , and all with an idea i dreamt up in the shower one morning			0

his invention ( illustrated ) includes a waterproof touchscreen , a disco ball shower head and speakers			0
the touchscreen controls music and the shower 's temperature mr @entity61 also built a prototype version of mr @entity99 's @entity29 ( pictured ) ‘ i ’d probably be late for work a few times with a @entity29			2

the touchscreen controls the music as well as the shower 's temperature			0
other entries included the beach ball chair - a lounger chair made from beach balls - and the @entity139			0
designed for ' those who get angry with their partner for squeezing the toothpaste from the front , ' the @entity139 is operated by opening the other end of the tube and squeezing from the back			0
elsewhere , the @entity149 entry is a tube attached to a chopping board that collects the crumbs created when making sandwiches or slicing bread			0
these crumbs are collected in a well that connects to an outside bird feeder			0

the freezer - wave was designed by @entity24 from @entity25
it was crowned @entity178 ’s *strangest* entry in the @entity27
a prototype of the *appliance* was built by @entity62 inventor @entity61
*gadget* works as a regular microwave until the freeze button is switched
carbon dioxide is then blasted into the microwave and freezes the contents
it can also cool down food and drinks that are too hot to be consumed
the time it takes to freeze food and drink depends on what is being frozen
