@entity0 has revolutionised the way we use the @entity3 , quickly rising to almost complete dominance over the search market			1
but for all its unerring ability to find what you are looking for , it has - up to now - still used a fairly ' dumb ' comparison program to match your search terms to pages stored in its database			2
but now , @entity0 has unleashed its latest technology on the world - a ' @entity17 ' which can understand the relationships between real - world objects , and bring all this information back to the user			1
instead of simply matching your keywords , @entity0 's technology will try to understand your query , and bring back the information you are looking for on the right - hand - side of the traditional results			1
@entity0 says this is a ' critical first step towards building the next generation of search , which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the world a bit more like people do			1
' a search for ' @entity38 ' brings up this kind of search box , with suggested follow - up searches suggested in blue searching ' @entity43 ' brings up a map of the @entity43 , while also offering other alternatives which the user may be looking for @entity0 said the search engine pulls the facts , figures and images from across the web - so it is not relying on the traditional search engine trick of pulling data from @entity54			1
@entity55 , @entity0 's senior vice president of engineering , said : ' search is a lot about discovery - the basic human need to learn and broaden your horizons			1
' but searching still requires a lot of hard work by you , the user			0
so today i ’m really excited to launch the @entity17 , which will help you discover new information quickly and easily			2
' the redesign , which for now affects only @entity72 - based @entity71 language users , is gradually being rolled starting wednesday on desktop , mobile and tablet platforms			2
@entity0 plans to eventually expand the new search features outside the @entity72 - and many @entity78 users have reported seeing the feature in the last few days			1
many of the results will carry more graphical elements , compared to standard lists of search results , such as maps and pictures of related results			1
the offering is the latest example of search companies moving away from offering a list of text - based links as search results			1
smarter on the right : the new look @entity0 will bring in information from sources like @entity54 if it thinks it knows what you want even @entity99 gets the treatment : the titanic star also gets his own instant answer within the search results page close up : details for @entity105 include the year of completion , a short description , links to related searches and to similar paintings			1
@entity99 's answer lists his films , similar searches , and a biography @entity0 is by far the leader in search , with 66 percent of the @entity72 market , according to @entity118			1
but it sees other sites such as @entity120 as competition , as users there can poll their friends and acquaintances for information on various topics without leaving the @entity120 ecosystem			0
under the new system , many users will end their internet search without leaving @entity0 's pages , when in the past they might have continued to a site such as @entity54 , which is collaborating with @entity0 on the new search features			1
@entity0 said it could actually drive more traffic to @entity54 , which will be prominently linked to in the summary boxes			1
the new techniques are based in large part on work done at online data collection @entity140 , @entity55 said			2
@entity140 was developed by @entity142 , a company @entity0 acquired in 2010			1
@entity0 is also working on being able to better answer more complex questions such as ' what are the ten deepest lakes in @entity146 ? ' that require its algorithms to factor in several different criteria			2
but it may never be able to crack some users ' toughest questions , such as ' does my hairstyle make me look fat ? ' which @entity55 said was a real user query			0
he said : ' we are not magicians - we are just computer science geeks			2
' similarly , @entity0 yesterday revealed the ' @entity159 ' , which provides a similar service while writing in @entity161 explaining the concept , @entity55 said : ' take a query like [ taj mahal ]			2
for more than four decades , search has essentially been about matching keywords to queries			1
to a search engine the words [ taj mahal ] have been just that - two words			1
' but we all know that [ taj mahal ] has a much richer meaning			0
you might think of one of the world ’s most beautiful monuments , or a @entity179 - winning musician , or possibly even a casino in @entity181 , @entity182			0
or , depending on when you last ate , the nearest @entity184 restaurant			0
' it ’s why we ’ve been working on an intelligent model - in geek - speak , a ' graph ' - that understands real - world entities and their relationships to one another : things , not strings			0
' @entity194 enables you to search for things , people or places that @entity0 knows about - landmarks , celebrities , cities , sports teams , buildings , geographical features , movies , celestial objects , works of art and more - and instantly get information that ’s relevant to your query			1
' this is a critical first step towards building the next generation of search , which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the world a bit more like people do			1
' he continued : ' @entity0 ’s @entity17 is n’t just rooted in public sources such as @entity140 , @entity54 and the @entity219			1
it ’s also augmented at a much larger scale - because we ’re focused on comprehensive breadth and depth			0
' it currently contains more than 500million objects , as well as more than 3.5billion facts about and relationships between these different objects			1
and it 's tuned based on what people search for , and what we find out on the web			2
' how do we know which facts are most likely to be needed for each item ? for that , we go back to our users and study in aggregate what they ’ve been asking @entity0 about each item			2
' for example , people are interested in knowing what books @entity241 wrote , whereas they ’re less interested in what books @entity244 wrote , and more in what buildings he designed			0
@entity161 - which has now been re-christened @entity249 - got a similar ' knowledge treatment ' this week			0
as you type into @entity0 's online word processor , @entity0 can return facts and images about your subject			1
users can specify if they want @entity161 - which has recently been re-christened as @entity257 - to search all of @entity0 , or just keep searches restricted to images and quotes			2
@entity0 software engineer @entity261 said : ' if you find something you like , you can add it by clicking the insert button or , for images , by dragging them directly into your document			2
' from the research pane , you can search for whatever info you need to help you write your document			0
with just a couple clicks you can look up maps , quotes , images , and much more			0
' if appropriate we 'll automatically add a footnote citation so there 's a record of where you found the info			0
' ' @entity194 also helps us understand the relationships between things			0
@entity38 is a person in the @entity17 , and she had two children , one of whom also won a @entity282 , as well as a husband , @entity283 , who claimed a third @entity282 for the family			0
all of these are linked in our graph			0
it ’s not just a catalog of objects ; it also models all these inter-relationships			0
it ’s the intelligence between these different entities that ’s the key			0
' we ’ve always believed that the perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want			2
and we can now sometimes help answer your next question before you ’ve asked it , because the facts we show are informed by what other people have searched for			0
' for example , the information we show for @entity303 answers 37 percent of next queries that people ask about him			0
' we ’ve begun to gradually roll out this view of the @entity17 to @entity72 @entity71 users			0
it ’s also going to be available on smartphones and tablets			0
' we ’re proud of our first baby step - the @entity17 - which will enable us to make search more intelligent , moving us closer to the " @entity315 computer " that i 've always dreamed of building			1
' enjoy your lifelong journey of discovery , made easier by @entity321 , so you can spend less time searching and more time doing what you love			0

search engine has 3.5billion facts ready to weave into search results
' @entity17 ' appears to the right of @entity0 's usual search results
system ' understands what you are talking about , rather than just matching keywords to web pages '
information is not just based on sources on @entity54 and @entity140 - but on ' what @entity0 finds on the web '
feature will also appear on tablets and smartphones
senior engineer : ' this is our baby step towards the ' @entity315 ' computer i have always dreamed of building '
