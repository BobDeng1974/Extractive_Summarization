organ traffickers gouged out the eyes of a six - year - old boy to sell on @entity5 ’s transplant black market , it was claimed yesterday			1
police said the child , @entity8 , was drugged after being kidnapped while playing outside his home			1
his family found him covered in blood and crying in pain three to four hours later			1
his eyes were found nearby with the corneas missing , police say , implying that an organ trafficker was behind the attack			1
police are seeking a woman suspect and have offered £ 10,500 for information leading to an arrest			0
about 300,000 patients in @entity5 need transplants each year , but only about 10,000 people can get them due to a lack of donors , state media said			1
few @entity5 agree to donate their organs after death , fuelling the rampant illegal market activity			1
child organs are usually more expensive on the black market , an organ trafficker told @entity45 news portal in 2010 , as ' most people think the younger the donor is , the better the quality of organs '			2
seven people were jailed last year when a teenager sold a kidney for an illicit transplant operation and used the proceeds to buy an @entity55 and @entity56			1
@entity8 ’s devastated father said : ‘ we did n’t notice his eyes were gone when we discovered him – he had blood all over his face			1
we thought he had fallen down and smashed his face			0
’ the boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes had been removed			2
his father said : ‘ his eyelids were turned inside out , and his eyeballs were not there			0
’ illegal organ harvesting is booming in @entity5 , where there is a shortage of donors , and last night , amid domestic and international outrage , @entity72 was urged to crack down on the country ’s multi-million - pound transplant industry			1
@entity8 was shown on state tv being taken in bandages from an operating theatre to a hospital bed , writhing in agony as his shocked family wept			0
@entity86 said he had been drugged and ‘ lost consciousness ’ before the attacker removed his eyes			2

mortified : relatives of the youngster talk to a nurse			2
his parents realised he was missing when they tried to call hm inside the house but received no response ' extraordinarily vicious ' : the child 's eyes were found nearby but the corneas were missing , reports said , implying that an organ trafficker was behind the harrowing attack after a frantic search with relatives , they found him screaming in a field near their home in @entity110 , north @entity5			1
the kidnapper had reportedly told @entity8 : ‘ do n’t cry and i wo n’t gouge out your eyes			1
’ the organ trafficker may have been motivated by money			0
but they could also have been driven to such a horrific crime by the hope of saving someone 's sight - or even their own			0
problems with the cornea - the clear front part of the eye - can cause the eye to mist up and , if left untreated , lead to blindness			0
but the most serious conditions such as @entity130 ' dystrophy , a degenerative condition that affects older people , can be cured with a transplant , above ( file picture )			0
until recent years , the only operation was a full cornea transplant , an operation that involved 24 stitches in each eye and an 18 - month recovery period			0
but advances in technology have meant surgeons can now carry out a partial replacement under local anaesthetic with a recovery time of just four weeks			0
@entity5 does not have a donor culture , but about 300,000 patients need transplants each year			1
only about 10,000 receive organs , mainly taken from death - row prisoners			0
though the sale and transplant of organs for money is prohibited , lax laws and widespread corruption have fuelled a booming industry			2
@entity5 is also a leading destination for ‘ transplant tourists ’ who travel there to obtain organs			1
last night international doctors appalled by @entity8 ’s suffering called on leading medical journals to ban publication of @entity5 research papers on organ transplants , to shame the country into tackling the problem			2
professor @entity171 , head of medical ethics at @entity173 and spokesman for doctors against @entity176 , said : ‘ as unimaginable and untrue as this boy ’s torment sounds , it shocks but does not surprise			0
‘ whereas hearts , livers and kidneys must be sourced from donors who match the same blood and body type of recipient patients , in - demand corneas for corrective eyesight operations can be taken from any age and body type			0
‘ anyone who knows where the corneas are located in the eye can extract them , and i fear for the unsterile conditions and the barbaric methods used , and that infection may add to the boy ’s suffering			0
‘ he will suffer unthinkable physical and psychological pain			0
’ professor @entity171 urged international governments to ‘ stand up to @entity5 ’ and take action to make it clean up its transplant industry			1
‘ transplant tourists who travel to @entity5 with the right amount of money can order the organ needed , ’ he said			1
‘ a prisoner is found to match the recipient and is taken out and shot			0
’ last weekend , @entity5 police detained members of a kidney - trafficking ring , including a team of four doctors and nurses			2
