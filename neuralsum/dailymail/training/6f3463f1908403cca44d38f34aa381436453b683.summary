by @entity0 in @entity1 last updated at 12:21 pm on 4th november 2011 @entity4 's criminally negligent care of @entity5 robbed the @entity5 's three children of their father , a court heard today			1
' for @entity5 's children , this case will go on forever , because they do not have a father , ' prosecutor @entity9 told jurors in his closing speech in the trial of @entity5 's private doctor			1
' the evidence in this case is abundantly clear - that @entity4 caused the death of @entity5 and that @entity4 left @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 without a father			1
the jury heard closing arguments on thursday in the manslaughter trial of @entity4 , who defense attorneys say is criminally liable for the death of @entity5 ' they do not have a father because of the actions of @entity4 , " he added			1
the @entity1 deputy district attorney told the hushed courtroom how @entity5 's daughter , @entity21 , now 13 , discovered @entity4 frantically trying to revive her father in his bedroom and screamed out ' @entity37 ! ' the children have not been in court during the five - week trial , but @entity5 's parents , @entity42 and @entity43 , were in the public gallery yesterday along with siblings @entity45 and @entity47			1
@entity4 showed no emotion as he was accused by the prosecutor of breaking the ' hallowed trust ' of the relationship between a doctor and his patient			2
' @entity4 is criminally liable			2
justice demands a guilty verdict , ' he said			2
he trusted him with his life			2
he trusted him with his own life and with the future lives of his children			2
@entity4 corrupted that relationship and because of that , @entity5 paid with his life , ' the prosecutor added			1
he said the evidence in the case was ' overwhelming ' that @entity4 , 58 , was criminally responsible for the june 25 2009 death of the 50 - year - old superstar			0
@entity5 's children , seen her last weekend at daughter @entity21 's soccer game , have not been in the courtroom for the trial , although his mother and various siblings have made appearances @entity4 has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter by injecting @entity5 with a lethal dose of the hospital anaesthetic propofol			1
mr @entity9 claimed @entity4 's administration of the powerful drug to treat @entity5 's chronic insomnia was an ' obscene experiment			1
' he said @entity4 should never have given propofol to @entity5 outside a hospital setting and then criminally botched his resuscitation efforts after @entity5 stopped breathing and lied to paramedics and hospital doctors to try and cover up his own guilt			1
he condemned the cardiologist 's delay in calling 911 as ' bizarre			0
' ' what on earth would motivate a medical doctor to delay making that call other than self preservation ? ' he asked the jury of seven men and five women			2
' he knew his acts killed @entity5			1
maybe he 's panicked , maybe he 's cleaning up			0
but he 's putting @entity4 first			0
he 's intentionally not calling 911			0
he 's intentionally delaying help that could have saved @entity5 's life			1
' the prosecutor blasted the defence claim that @entity5 injected himself with the deadly knock - out drug as ' junk science			1
' @entity1 deputy district attorney @entity9 said in his closing argument that @entity5 's children were robbed of a father who loved them very much by dr @entity4 's actions he also attacked anaesthesiologist dr @entity111 , the star defence witness , for ' sullying ' the trial with his ' garbage ' theories and flimsy research trying to support the suggestion that @entity5 died at his own hand			1
@entity5 was ' optimistic and excited ' about his upcoming ' this is it ' concerts at @entity122 's @entity121 and was looking forward to the future and performing for the first time in front of his children , ' he said			1
but just 12 hours after his final , exuberant rehearsal the star was ' lying in his bed , palms up , his head tilted to the side , dead in his bedroom			0
' @entity5 was not reckless			1
he had a life ahead of him			0
he had three children he loved dearly , ' said mr @entity9			0
' he wanted propofol to help him sleep			0
he wanted a doctor with eyes on him to keep him safe , ' he added			0
@entity5 , seen here on a trip to @entity140 with all three of his children in 2002 , when he controversially dangled newborn blanket over a hotel balcony , died when @entity20 was 12 , @entity21 was 11 and @entity22 was seven defence lawyer @entity144 questioned whether the case would have ever been launched if the victim had not been @entity5			1
' we have been dancing around this for six weeks , maybe two years			0
somebody has got to just say it - if it were anybody else but @entity5 would this doctor be here today ? ' he said			1
' there is a tremendous desire to paint dr @entity4 as the villain			0
they want to paint this perfect villain and this perfect victim			2
but there is not perfect villain and no perfect victim			2
' he was just a little fish in a big dirty pond , ' he added			0
' dr @entity4 's greatest defect is his greatest strength			0
he got brought into this situation because he thought he could help			0
he thought he could help @entity5 succeed			1
he thought he could help @entity5 sleep			1
' mr @entity169 said the prosecution ' is trying to convict dr @entity4 for the actions of @entity5			1
' @entity4 insists that his star client self - administered a lethal dose of the drug propofol after the doctor left him alone for a couple of minutes while he went to the toilet			0
mr @entity169 said @entity4 gave @entity5 a safe amount of propofol and was not using an iv drip , as the prosecution speculated			1
' it does n't matter if you go outside and play basketball or if you leave the patient or if you are on the phone , it does n't matter			0
dr @entity4 did not kill @entity5 , ' he told the court			1
but in his closing argument defense attorney @entity144 , right , questioned if the jury and judge @entity189 , left , would ever have heard of the case had the alleged victim not have been @entity5 he said it was ridiculous to suggest @entity4 delayed calling 911 when the doctor was desperately treeing to revive his patient			1
mr @entity169 complained that prosecutors were claiming everything was a deviation of the standard of medical care because @entity4 ' has to go down			0
' he said a prosecution witness who compared @entity4 leaving @entity5 alone in his bed to leaving a baby on a counter top was ' the most insulting thing ' you could say about the star			1
' @entity5 was an adult and he made his own decisions			2
he had plans for the future and he knew what he was doing			0
' this is not a reality show			0
this is real life , ' he added			0
the jury will start its deliberations friday morning after a final speech by prosecutor @entity9			1
' @entity219 , ' said mr @entity9 , who angrily denounced the doctor 's ' bizarre behaviour			0
' if they had time to argue i am sure they would haver found a way of blaming @entity5 's son , @entity20 , ' he added			2
' everything this doctor did was bizarre			0
none of it was consistent with a trained medical doctor who was putting his patient first			0
' what is unusual is that @entity5 lived as long as he did under the care of @entity4			2
' @entity5 is dead and we have to hear about poor @entity4 and how no doctor knows what it was like to be in his shoes			2
you 've got that right			0
' the way @entity4 treated with propofol in his bedroom ' has never been seen before , ever , ' he added			0
mr @entity9 also said @entity4 lied to @entity5 's mother , @entity43 , when he ' pulled a chair up next to her in hospital and told he he did n't know what happened ' to her son on the day he died .			2

meanwhile defence lawyer questioned whether the trial would exist if the victim had not been @entity5
