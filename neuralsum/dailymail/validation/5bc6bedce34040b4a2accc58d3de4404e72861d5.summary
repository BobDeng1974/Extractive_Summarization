it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			2
take a good look at a couple of stars at the @entity7 , the best band from @entity8 since @entity9 and a tricky @entity10			2
and peek through your hands at @entity13 in the pond			2
what 's hot big hitters while @entity20 's best cricketers have been riding open - top buses , the rest of the world has reinvented the game			1
watching batsmen like @entity24 and @entity25 during this @entity7 has been invigorating and depressing at the same time			1
@entity25 has been having a fair old hit during @entity28 's @entity7 campaign and @entity24 has n't exactly been holding back for @entity29 @entity30 @entity31 may not last long at @entity32 so let 's enjoy him			1
fan on wednesday : ' @entity35 is rubbish			0
why do n't you b * * * * ck him ? '			0
@entity31 : ' i have bloody b * * * * cked him ! ! ! '			0
@entity35 – standing 10 yards away – chose not to contribute			0
@entity31 found it hard to get the best out of @entity35 against @entity41 @entity35 did n't cover himself in glory against his former club and invited a b * * * * cking from his boss the @entity46 thanks to 40 years of dedication from match announcer @entity49 , @entity50 have long since played the best pre-match music and now he chooses tunes with hidden messages			0
rather more obvious , though , is his current fondness for the @entity56 hit : ' @entity57 '			0
is there another @entity57 at @entity59 apart from captain and @entity61 ? the unexpected what is sport if not a platform for genius ? even if you do n't care for @entity69 , i urge you to check out this piece of magic from @entity73 's @entity72 against @entity74 last weekend			2
what 's not @entity76 @entity78 golf fans will cherish @entity80 's uplifting win at the @entity81 but a final - round score of level par should n't have been enough			1
sadly , @entity76 's remarkable collapse – he found water five times in 10 holes – let @entity80 past and his search for only his second @entity91 stroke - play victory continues			1
@entity76 was n't a big fan of the fairways during the final round of the @entity81 at @entity95 @entity96 @entity20 's bowling coach has a fine reputation but what has he been doing these last few years ? last winter 's @entity101 tour saw three of his charges virtually unselectable while it is pertinent to ask which – if any – of our bowlers have actually improved in recent times			1
@entity96 ( centre ) , with @entity109 ( right ) and @entity110 ... so how 's that all going , then ? @entity111 @entity111 quit football at the age of 29 after falling out of love with the game			1
now he is trying his hand at @entity117 , an experiment you can watch on reality tv			0
@entity111 had a real talent for football sadly not matched by his ability to make the right choices			1
@entity111 fell out of love with football ... and into a nice stripy strip for a bit of the gaelic game @entity129 fans they 've been trying for months and it looks like they may finally get their man			1
so , for them , a warning			0
clubs only tend to head one way after @entity138 leaves			0
it 's to be hoped the @entity140 does n't become the best ground in the @entity142			2
will @entity138 be prowling the technical area at the @entity140 ?			0

@entity24 and @entity25 have shown @entity20 how to play
@entity76 's collapse allowed @entity80 to win the @entity81
@entity111 's talent not matched by his ability to make the right choices
