but these rules were often broken - and the riotous alcohol - fuelled life associated with many students today was just as prevalent as 170 years ago			1
these days were documented in a fascinating set of comic strips about the raucous life of @entity15 @entity14 theology student @entity13			1
the comic strips , written under the pen name of ' @entity13 ' , detail the alcohol - fuelled life of @entity15 @entity14 theology student @entity13 the 18 - year - old created the semi-autobiographical strips about the adventures of a ‘ freshmonne ’ - the predecessor to a first - year ‘ fresher ’ of today			1
they show how he was overawed upon his arrival in the city and was ' by no means certain as to where on earth he can be going ' in an omnibus			2
later on the student is encouraged over dinner to the ' freshman 's wine ' and ' finds the reality far beyond his expectation ' when he becomes drunk			2
he is then ' assisted to his own rooms ' by other students and ' passes an uneasy night on his hearth - rug ' before the maid finds him there in the morning			1
the strips - written under the pen name of ' @entity13 ' - were found in a city library and restored by @entity44 , 20 , of @entity45 , @entity46			1

this guy has frozen in time a window on student life			1
‘ this is freshers ’ week , 1840s - style			2
as a “ freshmonne ” he matriculated here in 1845 and graduated in 1848			0

he probably thinks the other guys are taking advantage of him			0

‘ you had a bedtime and servants went round to make sure your light was turned off , ’ he added			0
modern - day @entity14 students set a trend last december for ' porting ' , which involved pouring bottles of @entity92 over their heads while being filmed the @entity2 students started the trend as an answer to the ' milking ' video from students at rival @entity99 , which saw students pour milk over their heads in a similar fashion modern - day @entity14 students set a trend last december for ‘ porting ’ , which involved pouring bottles of @entity92 over their heads for a video			1
it was an answer to the ‘ @entity97 ’ video from students at rival @entity99 , which saw students pour milk over their heads in a similar fashion			2
mr @entity44 pointed out that @entity15 students came up with equally bizarre ideas in their spare time , such as trying to wake up as many citizens of the city as possible at night			1
‘ alcohol is not a new thing - if anything , you would have more alcohol then , with every meal			1
the students had a lot of time on their hands ' - student @entity44 he said : ‘ students would climb to the top of the castle keep and would take their hunting horn			1
one bloke used to blow his horn across the city and see how many people he could wake up			0
‘ he kept a score chart with his friends			0
you got one point for getting someone out of bed and three points for getting someone out of bed with a nightcap on			0
‘ alcohol is not a new thing - if anything , you would have more alcohol then , with every meal			1
the students had a lot of time on their hands			0
‘ they were n’t allowed out of college after 10pm			0

‘ they could either scale the wall or ring the bell for the warden - and then face their wrath in the morning			0
it is not only modern - day students who spend their spare time coming up with bizarre ideas - students throughout the ages have been involved in odd trends in the past , @entity2 students set a trend for trying to wake up as many citizens of the city as possible at night ‘ the young men here would have wanted to get into mischief , but they were n’t allowed into local bars and would have to wear their gowns wherever they go			1
’ he added : ‘ but from the very first years there are records of students breaking both those rules in one go - and then being caught			2
‘ the original rules of the university were very strict – how well they were lived out was debatable			0
also the playing of dice , cards and gambling were banned , or going into a confectionery shop			0
