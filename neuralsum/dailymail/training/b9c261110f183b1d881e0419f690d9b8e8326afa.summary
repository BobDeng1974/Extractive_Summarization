the couple are the subject of @entity37 , a new documentary that explores the concept of yellow fever indeed , according to @entity41 , a post-doctoral fellow in counseling at @entity43 , the dominant perception is that women from @entity45 are ' submissive '			1
in a 2011 @entity47 article , dr @entity41 explained that the men who desire @entity7 women - most of them @entity49 themselves - are sending an ' underlying message about power , dominance and white privilege '			2
it is exactly that attitude that ms @entity8 sought to expose in her debut feature - length film			2
' every @entity7 - @entity20 woman knows exactly what i am talking about , ' she said			1
' men come up to you in a way that really looks like a stare , which lasts a bit longer than it should			0
' you can feel it , ' she continued			0
' it 's like they are looking through you			0
' in the film , ms @entity8 follows the lives of @entity32 , a twice - divorced 60 - year - old on the hunt for an @entity7 bride , and @entity34 , the @entity11 woman half his age whom he meets on the internet and ultimately marries			1

' i 'm happy as a clam , ' he says in the trailer as he introduces his bride - to - be to the filmmaker according to the website for the documentary , @entity32 first became interested in @entity7 women after witnessing the success of his son 's marriage to a @entity98 immigrant			1
the 60 - year - old , who works as a garage attendant at the @entity102 airport , spent years looking through mail - order catalogs and dating websites , trying to find the perfect mate			1
' over the course of the last five years there must be hundreds of different girls from @entity84 that i 've been writing to , ' he explains in a trailer for the movie			0
' men come up to @entity7 - @entity20 women , and it 's like they are looking through them ' finally , @entity32 meets @entity34 - a 30 - year - old factory worker who grew up on a tea farm in the remote mountains of @entity84			1
he flies out to @entity34 's home country to meet her , and two weeks later he returns to @entity119 with @entity34 in tow , after she agrees to marry him			0
' i 'm happy as a clam , ' he says in the trailer with a boyish grin as he introduces his fiancee to the film director			0
but while @entity32 has fulfilled his fantasy by having a relationship with an @entity7 woman , the couple soon begins to struggle to communicate , since @entity34 's @entity131 is basic and @entity32 does n't speak a word of @entity11			1
the trailer shows them bickering , with neither able to understand the other			0
' what ? ' @entity32 yells to sandy at one point			0
' speak in @entity131 ! ' issues : the couple - neither of whom speak each other 's language well - soon begin to struggle to communicate with each other			0
' i have no idea what she 's saying , ' admits @entity32 ms @entity8 , who speaks @entity11 , becomes a translator and mediator as both @entity34 and @entity32 turn to her to resolve their issues			1
@entity32 admits to the filmmaker : ' [ @entity34 ] has read a lot of things to me in @entity11			1
i feel comfortable with it , but i have no idea what she 's saying			0
' ultimately though , their relationship works after @entity32 realizes that he can love @entity34 despite her fiery temper , a trait which contradicts the stereotypical picture of an @entity7 female			2
today , @entity34 and @entity32 have been happily married for four years			2
' yellow fever is very painful for the @entity166 ' ' [ @entity32 's ] obsession with any @entity7 woman has been replaced with a real - live @entity34 , ' explains ms @entity8 , who admits that her own preconception of @entity32 was perhaps just as bad as those she sought to debunk about @entity7 women			1
still , ms @entity8 said she hopes the film will start a conversation about negative categorizations in general - including those involving men like @entity32			2
' the story is about expectations and stereotypes , which are very related , ' she said			0
' stereotypes about white guys , and expectations going into a relationship			0
