a @entity3 robotics expert has built the world 's first real - life , working @entity6			1
children of the @entity8 will remember the @entity10 toy range and cartoon as one of the most iconic of its era			0
but , until now , working versions have been unavailable			0
robots in disguise : @entity19 , a hobby robot research from @entity21 , @entity3 , has built the world 's first working @entity6 - type toy - a dream come true for many men who grew up during the @entity8 strong enough to break the bravest heart : mr @entity19 's robot converts from a 1/12 scale remote controlled car into a walking , rocket launcher wielding robot hero in a matter of seconds @entity19 , a hobby robot researcher from @entity21 , in @entity3 's @entity35 , is the first to build and market a remote - control car that is ' more than meets the eye '			1
the robot , which appears not to be endorsed in any way by @entity10 ' maker @entity40 , and is simply called @entity41 7.2 , can convert from a cool looking 1/12 scale @entity42 into a robot hero in seconds			1
and that 's not all , it also comes equipped with a rocket launcher in each arm , working lights , and a @entity51 camera that allows users to follow its exploits			1
controlled by what appears to be a modified @entity57 joypad , it transforms from a car into a robot and back again in seconds			1
it is able to both walk on two legs and , just like any other rc car , drive on its four wheels			1
the @entity51 camera transmits a view of the world as seen by the robot to any internet - connected device like a pc or tablet so that the owner can get a totally immersive experience			1
but this is just the start of the research			0
by 2030 , mr @entity19 hopes to build his first full - size , fully working transforming robot that humans can ride			2

beginning with the @entity10 toy line , the franchise centres on factions of transforming alien robots - the @entity98 and the @entity99 - in an endless struggle for dominance or eventual peace			0
in its decades - long history , the original @entity3 idea has expanded to encompass comic books , animation , video games and films			2
it remains popular to this day			0
@entity111 pictured in the recent series @entity10 : mr @entity19 hopes to build his first full - size , fully working transforming robot that humans can ride by 2030 the @entity84 is the product of a decade of research by mr @entity19 's company @entity87			2
he has offered a limited run of just 10 of the robots for sale , but a one - month wait for shipping means even if you order today its unlikely to make its way from @entity3 in time for @entity125			1
but if you ordered today , you might just get lucky			0
mr @entity19 is said to be preparing to showcase his remarkable invention next week at @entity127 2012			0
