a leading scientist has said that life may still exist on @entity2 , despite @entity4 ’s inability to find methane gas on the planet ’s surface			1
the president of the @entity9 , @entity8 , told @entity10 that methane - a gas produced by living things - may still exist because the rover has only analysed a relatively small area of the red planet			1
last week , @entity15 said that it was unlikely that microbes capable of producing the gas were living below the planet 's surface after @entity4 failed to find the gas			1
the criticism follows a discussion of @entity4 ’s findings presented at the @entity32 in @entity33 earlier this month			0
the conference highlighted some of @entity4 ’s most brilliant finds before the rover began its journey to @entity39 in july			2
data collected by the @entity4 at this time suggested the red planet 's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than @entity46 , giving serious weight to the theory it could have previously harboured alien life			1
in july , data collected by the @entity4 suggested the red planet 's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than @entity46 a team of @entity15 scientists said that a change in the ratio of two different kinds of argon gas was evidence that the atmosphere has been stripped away			1
@entity15 's dr @entity63 said : ' as @entity2 became a planet and its magma ocean solidified , catastrophic outgassing occurred while volatiles were delivered by impact of comets and other smaller bodies			2
' solar wind , and the possible impact by a @entity74 - sized body is thought to have stripped much of the initial early atmosphere from the planet , and since then the atmosphere has developed as a balance between volcanic injection and loss to space			2
' only a month earlier , powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity2 was found by the ageing vehicle			2
evidence of water on @entity2 had previously been indicated by a succession of discoveries - but all had suggested flows of sulphuric acid			0
this was the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable			0
scientists also discovered pebbles on @entity2 , showing that a stream had flowed on the planet			0
the rounded pebbles could only have formed when they were carried through water over long distances , according to researchers			0
scientists had previously discovered pebbles on @entity2 , showing that a stream has flowed on the planet - giving more weight to the theory that it was once able to support life in april , the $ 2.5 billion rover found evidence that as much as 90 per cent of the original atmosphere there had dissipated into space over the planet 's lifetime			1
curiosity also revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds			1
the conference focused heavily on a the @entity123 pebble crushed under the @entity4 's wheels which split open to reveal a dazzling white interior - a sign that it contained hydrated minerals , formed when water flowed through it			0
curiosity is now on a long journey to @entity39 , which rises 3.4 miles into the @entity2 sky from @entity134 's center			0
the rover will take monthly readings of the @entity2 atmosphere during the road trip , expected to last almost a year ' @entity4 can do all kinds of things			1
it has imaging capability , a telescope for microorganisms , ' said mr @entity8 in his interview with @entity10			2
' maybe a puff of methane will come and it will be detected later			0
there 's lot for @entity4 to look for			0

curiosity rover has found no sign of methane , which is produced by life
robot has spent a year on red planet scanning its surface and atmosphere
@entity8 claims inability to find methane may be because rover has only explored a relatively small area
