@entity1 captain @entity0 believes it is vitally important to start the @entity4 qualifying campaign with a positive result in @entity6			1
just 76 days after their disastrous @entity9 campaign came to an end , thoughts have turned to the @entity1 ' next major tournament in @entity12			1
a failure of even more epic proportions than @entity15 looks necessary to make it out of @entity17 , although @entity19 's side face their toughest match first			1
preparation : @entity0 leads his @entity1 team - mates through their paces at @entity25 leader : @entity0 was appointed as @entity1 captain after @entity28 retired from international football @entity6 are ranked ninth in the world and are favourites at the bookmakers to win monday 's encounter at @entity35 - something @entity0 knows they can not let happen			1
' it is important to start the qualifying campaign off with a good result , ' he said			2
' it is important to try and win the game , but i think not to get beat and give @entity6 the upper hand from the first game is vital			1
' understandably , there is a lot of doom and gloom around the @entity1 team in the wake of the @entity9			1
the public 's apathy was highlighted by the fact wednesday 's 1 - 0 friendly win against @entity57 attracted @entity59 's lowest crowd for an international since the stadium 's opening in 2007			2
furthermore , the 40,181 that did turn up were hardly wowed as the @entity1 display lacked inspiration and quality			2
celebrate : @entity0 pumps his fist after opening the scoring on his debut as captain against @entity57 bang : @entity0 smashed home the penalty at a far - from - full @entity59 to give @entity1 the win however , @entity0 is confident that good times are around the corner , pointing to the spirit and excitement brought by the performance in the @entity9 opener against @entity81 , even if the game in @entity83 ended in defeat			1
' it 's exciting times , ' he said			2
' the @entity81 and @entity89 games were disappointing results , but i thought we did well in both games			0
' it could have gone either way , but we lost and we 're out			0
we played some great attacking football			0
' the lads who were at that tournament have gained vital experience from the tournament			0
' the pressure is now on such players to step up to the plate , with the retirement @entity28 , @entity105 and @entity106 compounded by a raft of injuries			0
hard task : @entity0 reckons @entity1 will need to win in @entity6 - and it 's their toughest game on his toes : @entity0 looked sharp in @entity1 training , showing his less experienced team mates the way those problems have worsened further in recent days , with @entity120 goalkeeper @entity119 and uncapped @entity122 midfielder @entity121 forced to withdraw from the squad			1
things got worse still on friday , when @entity125 sustained a thigh complaint in training			0
after a scan , the 25 - year - old returned to @entity129 for treatment , further reducing their options for the match in @entity133			0
posting via his account , @ @entity125 , he said : ' heartbroken soul right now believe me			0
hopefully be back soon fighting fit for @entity139			0
nothing worse than being injured			0
my heads gone ' hope : captain @entity0 will hope he can grab another goal to give @entity1 a dream start in @entity133			1

@entity0 believes @entity1 have to get qualifiers off to a good start
the @entity1 face @entity6 in @entity149 on monday in their first game
@entity0 took over the captaincy after a *terrible* @entity9
@entity6 , ranked ninth in the world , are favourites to win the opener
it is @entity19 's side 's toughest test in relatively *simple* group
