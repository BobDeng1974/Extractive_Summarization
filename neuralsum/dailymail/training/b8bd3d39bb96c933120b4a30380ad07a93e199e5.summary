by @entity0 convicted : sergeant @entity1 was found guilty of murder by a court martial in november a @entity4 who murdered a wounded @entity7 fighter in cold blood has failed in his attempt to overturn the conviction			1
but sergeant @entity1 - who fired a pistol into the man 's chest with the words ' shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * * ' - had his sentence reduced by two years			1
three leading judges decided that combat stress suffered by @entity1 , 39 , should have been given more weight , and cut the time he would have to serve in jail from ten years to eight			1
the soldier was convicted by a court martial @entity25 , @entity27 in november			1
he was originally known as @entity1 , but the @entity28 ruled that his name should be released when he was first sentenced			1
lord chief justice @entity30 , sir @entity31 and @entity32 , giving their ruling in @entity35 , said that the particular stresses affecting @entity1 should have been ' accorded greater weight as a mitigating factor '			1
allowing an appeal against sentence , lord @entity30 said : ' on all the evidence before us it is clear that in the events surrounding the murder of the insurgent , the appellant acted entirely out of character and was suffering from combat stress disorder '			1
as well as the life sentence @entity1 , now 39 , was ' dismissed with disgrace ' from the @entity4 after he had served with distinction for 15 years , including tours of @entity55 , @entity7 and @entity56			1
the killing happened in @entity58 in 2011 while @entity1 , who is known as @entity59 , was serving with @entity61 - based @entity60			1
he referenced @entity82 as the man convulsed and died in front of him			2
@entity1 said : ' there you are			1
shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * *			0
it 's nothing you would n't do to us '			0
he then turned to comrades and said : ' obviously this does n't go anywhere , fellas			0
i just broke the @entity97 '			0
his younger colleagues were cleared of any wrongdoing			0
known as @entity100 during the trial , they were later named as corporal @entity102 and @entity104 @entity103			0
the shooting was captured on a camera mounted on @entity108 's helmet			0
@entity1 , who denied murder , said he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse			1
wife : @entity114 was at the @entity28 today for the result of the appeal trauma : friends of @entity1 have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty he has said he felt ashamed , describing the killing as a ' stupid lack of self - control and lapse in judgment '			1
reducing the minimum term , lord @entity30 said : ' it is very unfortunate that the only medical evidence before the court martial and before us was obtained over two years after the murder			1
' we have accorded particular attention to the view of the court martial that thousands of other service personnel experienced the same or similar stresses and still acted properly and humanely			1
@entity1 : right , get him closer so @entity139 ca n't see what we 're doing to him			1
unknown : ( place / push ) him in there , come on			0
@entity1 : get him right in			1
@entity1 : over by that corn			1
later marine d : do you want him back in ? @entity1 : yeah , i want , i want him in this area so i can see what the f * * * ( we 're / i 'm ) doing			1
@entity1 : anybody want to do first aid on this idiot ? unknown : no. marine b : no. @entity4 c : i 'll put one in his head , if you want			1
@entity1 : no , not in his head , cause that 'll be f * * * ing obvious			2
unknown : just move him round here			0
marine b : going to switch this f * * * ing off ( camera )			0
later marine b : for f * * * 's sake , i can not believe i 'm doing this			0
@entity4 c : wait a minute , just present to do it till he 's behind them trees			0
unknown : just strangle him			0
later ( @entity173 shot ) unknown : ( what was that ? ) unknown : ( do n't know			2
) @entity1 : there you are , shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * *			2
@entity1 : it 's nothing you would n't do to us			2
marine b : i know			0
@entity1 : obviously , this does n't go anywhere fellas			2
marine b : yeah , roger , mate			0
@entity1 : i 've just broken the @entity97 convention			2
marine b : yeah , roger			0
@entity1 : biometric data module , right , er , try and brush some of that s * * * off his face			2
marine b : if anything gets heard , mate , it 's as a warning shot went down			2
' however , in assessing the evidence of stress and its effect on the appellant , we attach particular importance to the evidence in relation to the remoteness of the command post at which the appellant had been stationed for five and a half months and the limited contact with those commanding him			2
' his mental welfare had not been assessed in the way in which it would ordinarily be assessed by a commanding officer and there is evidence that he was becoming somewhat paranoiac about the @entity66 's " gunning " for him '			0
the judge added : ' taking into account the whole of the evidence , we conclude that combat stress arising from the nature of the insurgency in @entity7 and the particular matters we have identified as affecting him ought to have been accorded greater weight as a mitigating factor '			1
lord @entity30 announced : " on that basis we have therefore concluded that although he remains subject to a sentence of imprisonment for life , the minimum term which he must serve before being considered for parole should be reduced to eight years			1
' his release will then depend on the @entity239 and , even thereafter , he will remain subject to the terms of the conditions of his licence			0
to that extent and to that extent only is this appeal allowed '			0
referring to the ' aggravating ' features of the case , lord @entity30 said the first related to the circumstances of the shooting as found proved by the court martial			1
' these included four deliberate acts			0
these were , first , the appellant 's decision to stop first aid ; second , the appellant 's order to move the insurgent to a place where what he intended to do would not be seen ; third , the discharge of the round into the insurgent 's chest ; and fourth , the instruction to the patrol to say nothing about what had happened '			0
lord @entity30 said : ' true it may be that there may have been other insurgents in the vicinity , but that played no causative effect in the appellant 's decision to fire at the wounded insurgent and kill him '			0
the second aggravating feature ' was the deliberate involvement by the appellant of soldiers who looked to him for leadership in a dishonest cover up of what had happened and the construction of the account that the insurgent was already dead '			0
lord @entity30 said : ' @entity290 was the appellant 's failure to follow , both personally as a soldier and , furthermore , as the person in command of the patrol , the standards of conduct which represented the values for which @entity296 had been sent to @entity7 '			2
an @entity301 spokesman said after the ruling : ' we respect the authority and decision of the appeal court , and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the sentence ' .			2

sergeant @entity1 , 39 , killed an @entity7 man in 2011
he shot the wounded man in the chest with a pistol
@entity1 was convicted of murder in a court martial last november
he tried to overturn the conviction , but his attempt was not *successful*
however , judges reduced time he will spend in prison from 10 to 8 years
they said original sentence did not give enough weight to combat stress
