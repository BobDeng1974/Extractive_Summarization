by @entity0 a millionaire @entity2 mp has admitted making an expenses claim for the electricity used by his horse riding business and a yard manager ’s mobile home			1
@entity9 , who was a successful entrepreneur before becoming an mp in 2010 , had the highest energy expenses of any politician , a newspaper report revealed			1
he said the claim was a ‘ mistake ’ as he had not realised there was no separate energy bill for the horse riding business run from his sprawling 31 - acre @entity17 estate			1
apology : @entity2 mp @entity9 , 46 , has apologised for claiming almost £ 6,000 in electricity bills to run a business from his second home mr @entity9 has been a vociferous supporter of statute - backed press regulation			1
last year , he was one of 42 @entity2 mps to sign a letter calling for tight controls			2
he agreed with @entity28 that having the @entity29 preside over its own regulator was akin to ‘ having the industry mark its own homework ’			0
the @entity34 mp claimed nearly £ 6,000 for his energy bills			1
mps are only allowed to claim expenses on domestic energy use at their second homes , not for costs linked to running a business			1
mr @entity9 vowed to repay the money in full but said the figure had included bills for a previous year and was closer to £ 4,000			1
he said : ‘ i have been looking into this matter further and can confirm that all claims for heating fuel relate purely to my second home			0
however , i have made a mistake with my electricity claims			1
‘ electricity for a mobile home located in the stable yard , and electricity for the stables themselves , was linked to my house			2
‘ whilst a meter was installed in the stable yard , i have only been receiving one bill ; it was wrong to assume i was receiving two and to have not checked this sooner			0
‘ i am mortified by this mistake and apologise unreservedly for it			0
i will obviously be paying back any money that was wrongly claimed immediately			0
’ mr @entity9 ’s second home has a stable with room for at least 20 horses			2
he runs @entity70 and @entity71 from the estate with his wife @entity73			0

@entity88 mp @entity87 called for the @entity89 , @entity89 , to investigate the claims revealed by the @entity91			1
the @entity93 mp said : ‘ if one of my constituents had done this they would have been expecting a knock on the door from the police			0
ipsa need to look at this and find out why it was n’t spotted			0
’ @entity102 , a @entity88 councillor in @entity34 , said : ‘ people will be stunned to find they have been paying for the running of mr @entity9 ’s stables			1
’ he said mr @entity9 ’s position was ‘ untenable ’ , particularly as many of his constituents were grappling with spiralling energy bills			2
visitors to mr @entity9 ’s personal website were not sympathetic			0
@entity112 posted : ‘ if i over-claimed to a similar extent at my workplace , i would be sacked for gross misconduct			0
‘ please could you explain why you deserve a different approach ? ’ another said : ‘ do you think it is fair and reasonable for mps to claim such large amounts for energy for their second homes ? surely it should be capped at the average energy bill or say £ 1,000			1
’ @entity126 wrote : ‘ if you have enough money for two homes why do you need to claim money back to heat them ? why do n’t you get rid of one and use the money to heat the other ? then you wo n’t need to use taxpayers ’ money			2
