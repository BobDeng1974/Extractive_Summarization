by @entity0 and @entity1 prince @entity2 dubbed it ' bloody daft ' and critics say that the idea of debutantes presenting themselves to the aristocracy is outdated and elitist , but for certain sections of @entity13 society the @entity9 's ball at the @entity10 is the ultimate summer event			1
dubbed the ' crowning event of the @entity16 ' the guest list is hand - picked with care : only young women from the richest families are invited to the ball where , after months of careful preparation and spending thousands of pounds on each ticket , the young debutantes are able to show off their skills in poise and elegance			2
in the past debutante balls were seen as a rite of passage for the young women of the upper classes , an opportunity to introduce themselves to society and seek out a potential suitor , but for today 's debutantes the season is seen as an opportunity to wear a designer gown , party their way around @entity41 , and do a little something for charity			2

the event involves meetings with aristocracy , etiquette classes , and charity fund - raising , and the ' deb of the year ' is chosen according to ' who has worked hardest ’ during fund - raising activities throughout the season and shown the most enthusiasm ( she is usually the prettiest too , although that is not an official judging requirement )			0

up until 1958 , young debutantes used to be presented to the @entity95 at @entity101 , until prince @entity2 pointed out that it was ‘ bloody daft ’			0
not only did parents hope their daughters would meet a suitable young man , the season aimed to equip the young women with poise , confidence and social skills needed for their married lives			2
the white dresses worn by the debutantes are a nod to the virginity that was once required of a bride			0
they are also a reminder of the outfits worn by @entity9 's ladies , who all would have been single women			1
as well as prince @entity122 's dismissal , the @entity95 felt such an elitist event was at odds with her desire for a more modern monarchy			2

the ball was cancelled in 1976 because it was felt it had strayed too far from its more genteel and refined roots , but was resurrected in 2007 by a former debutane called @entity166 , who was reportedly begged ' top keep the season alive ' by society magazine @entity169 ’s former social editor , @entity168 , apparently begged @entity171 from his deathbed			1
attendees are now from backgrounds that would have raised eyebrows among the social set of the event 's heyday			2
' in countries such as the @entity183 and @entity184 , there ’s still a section of high society that takes the ' season ’ very seriously , as a rite of passage for their daughters , ' @entity179 , designer of this year ’s ball gowns , told the @entity190			1
' but in @entity16 , you ’re not likely to meet the daughter of a duke any more			0
