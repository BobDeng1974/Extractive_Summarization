by @entity0 published : 15:11 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 15:11 est , 7 january 2013 a terrifying sea monster with five inch knife - edged teeth that roamed prehistoric @entity4 almost 250 million years ago has been unveiled by scientists			1
the giant predator was about 28 feet long ( 8.6 metres ) in length and is the first top predator in marine food chains that would have fed on prey similar to its own size			1
its fossil described online in @entity15 was dug out of rocks dating back 244 million years at a time when the @entity4 desert where it was found was covered by a warm ocean			1
named @entity23 saurophagis - meaning ' lizard - eating sovereign of the sea ' - the sea creature had five inch teeth and was at the top of the food chain named @entity23 saurophagis - meaning ' lizard - eating sovereign of the sea ' - it 's an early representative of the ichthyosaurs			1
these were a group of marine reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs and roamed the oceans for 160 million years			2
during the middle @entity39 , ichthyosaurs evolved from as yet unidentified land reptiles that moved back into the water , in a development parallel to that of the ancestors of modern - day dolphins and whales			2
they were particularly abundant in the @entity48 , until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by another reptilian order named plesiosaurs in the @entity53			2
@entity23 had a massive skull and jaws armed with large teeth with cutting edges used to seize and slice through other marine reptiles in the @entity39 seas			1
because it was a meta - predator - capable of feeding on animals with bodies similar in size to its own - @entity23 was comparable to modern orca whales			1
a jaw full of five - inch , knife - edged teeth let this newly unearthed ichthyosaur tear into prey			0
the species swam in what is now @entity4			1
tooth crown of @entity23 as seen in the field			1
the shape of the crown with its two cutting edges indicates that this ichthyosaur was a meat eater , not a fish eater			0
remarkably only eight million years prior to the appearance of @entity23 , a severe extinction at the end of the @entity84 period killed as many as 80 to 96 percent of species in the @entity87 's oceans			1
the rise of a predator such as @entity23 documents the fast recovery and evolution of a modern ecosystem structure after the extinction			1
dr @entity93 , of the @entity94 in @entity95 , said : ' everyday we learn more about the biodiversity of our planet including living and fossil species and their ecosystems			0
' the new find characterises the establishment of a new and more advanced level of ecosystem structure			0
' findings like @entity23 help us to understand the dynamics of our evolving planet and ultimately the impact humans have on today 's environment			1
' this is what the jaws of @entity23 looked like when they were discovered by @entity115 preparator @entity114 on july 24 , 1998			2
paleontologist @entity116 preparing a plaster jacket for the fossil of the new ichthyosaur in the field in @entity4 the ichthyosaur was recovered from what is today a remote mountain range in central @entity4			2
most of the animal was preserved including the skull except the front of the snout , parts of the fins and the complete vertebral column up to the tip of the tail			0
supported by a grant from the @entity136 's @entity135 and exploration , the team of paleontologists took three weeks to unearth the ichthyosaur in 2010 and prepare it for its transport by helicopter and truck out of the field			0
study co-author dr @entity144 , of @entity115 in @entity145 , said : ' this discovery is a good example of how we study the past in order to illuminate the future			0
' the back of the skull and neck during the excavation of the ichthyosaur skeleton in 2008			0
the bones are encased in a large nodule , the pieces of which were numbered for later reassembly			0
a view down @entity162 with @entity165 preparator @entity163			0
the new ichthyosaur came from the beds in the background above the steep canyon walls			0
this is the right side of the skull during preparation in the @entity115 labs showing the upturned eyeball and the huge teeth in front of it .			0

giant 28 foot long predator roamed seas that once covered @entity4
named @entity23 saurophagis - meaning ' lizard - eating sovereign of the sea '
