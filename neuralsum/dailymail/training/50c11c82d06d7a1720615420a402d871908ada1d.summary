by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 9 september 2013 the mightiest warship of her day has lain for 269 years on the seabed of the @entity5 @entity4 , a site too deep and dangerous for all but specialist divers with the most sophisticated technology			1
now the historic @entity9 can be seen for the first time in unprecedented detail with the launch of the first ever ' virtual dive ' , @entity14 can reveal			1
unique film footage on www.victory1744.org shows the wreck of the most important @entity19 vessel after the @entity20 , the 16th - century @entity22 warship			0
but , from the comfort of dry land , high - definition film footage simulates the experience of exploring the wreck like a diver - watching cod and jelly - fish swimming above scattered 18th - century bronze cannon , crabs scurrying amongst ballast and conger eels slithering inside hollow gun bores			0
@entity53 victory - predecessor to admiral @entity55 ’s flagship bearing the same name - was the world ’s most powerful ship when she disappeared beneath the waves			1
built with three decks , she carried up to 110 bronze cannon			1
returning home from a successful mission against the @entity65 in @entity66 and @entity67 , she succumbed to a ferocious storm on 5 october 1744 , with the loss of 1,100 lives			2
find out more on @entity72 remains : one of 110 cannons thought to be aboard the @entity9 lies in the seabed , 75 meters below the surface of the @entity22 channel break through : until now , the site had only been explored by divers with specialist technology remains washed up on the @entity82 had long ago led to the assumption that this @entity22 flagship had been lost somewhere on the @entity85 , off @entity86			1
but this great maritime mystery was solved when @entity88 – leading specialists in deep - sea archaeological research – discovered that she actually lay 80 kilometres southeast of @entity91			1
@entity88 ’s previous discoveries include an @entity94 shipwreck , from which it recovered over 50,000 coins and 14,000 artifacts			0
it located the @entity9 wreck while conducting an extensive archaeological survey across 4,700 square nautical miles in the @entity5 @entity4 using side - scan sonar and magnetometry			2
its subsequent study of the wreck revealed that @entity9 ’s demise was not caused by dangerous rocks or the failure of the @entity86 lighthouse keeper to keep the fire burning , as believed at the time			1
instead , the ship ’s top - heavy weight and instability caused by heavy guns and possibly rotting timbers , made it all the more vulnerable in a storm			2
storm : the loss of the @entity9 , dramatically painted by 18th century artist @entity119 unseen : the @entity9 1744 website , left , hosts the tour of the @entity9 , illustrated right @entity88 says that footage of the entire shipwreck site has never been seen before			1
taken with a @entity127 - @entity127 robot - driven from a research ship anchored on the surface , the footage shows a site scattered with dozens of bronze cannon , hull remains , wood and bronze rigging , anchors and the ship ’s rudder			1
the @entity9 was the world ’s most powerful ships when she disappeared beneath the waves in 1744			1
crewed by over a thousand men including noted @entity144 admiral sir @entity143 , the @entity9 was returning home from a successful mission against the @entity65 in @entity66 and @entity67 when , on october 5 , she hit a ferocious storm			2
it is thought that the heaviness of the ship , which had three decks and carried up to 110 bronze cannon , contributed to the sinking of the vessel			1
along with the cannon collection , some believe the ship was carrying a large quantity of gold coins , which would now be worth a reported £ 500 million			0
the ship 's location remained a mystery for hundreds of years , despite numerous searches			0
but in 2008 , an @entity166 crew discovered the ship nearly 65 miles from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked			0
a battered copper kettle used to cook fish and meat lies partly submerged in the sand , while an intact glass bottle can be seen alongside a resting monk fish			0
but @entity88 also warns that the site is at risk as the area is heavily trafficked by fishing trawlers , lobster - crab potters and scallop dredges , dragging heavy gear across the seabed			0
one three - ton bronze cannon was dragged 233metres away from the wreck mound			0
dr @entity187 , director of @entity188 , a @entity189 - based consultancy specialising in global maritime heritage , said : ' the wreck site is more dangerous now than the day a storm swallowed @entity9			1
' distance from shore , shipping traffic , fishing trawlers raking the seabed and ever - changing currents make access perilous			0
' because people ca n’t appreciate the victory by scuba diving , the virtual trail safely brings the site to the people			2
' now everyone can share the warship ’s deep - sea wonders			0
' the @entity9 site is owned by the @entity209 after its remains were gifted to it by the @entity212			2
@entity88 has submitted detailed plans to the government for the recording and recovery of artifacts at risk			0
the @entity219 would be the first deep - sea wreck excavation conducted entirely by remote technology off the @entity222 .			0

@entity9 , predecessor to admiral @entity55 ’s flagship bearing the same name , sunk in 1744
all 1,100 crew aboard died when ship , laden with 110 bronze cannons , went down during *vicious* storm
the ship , which lays on dangerous site 80 kilometres southeast of @entity91 , had only be accessed by divers using specialist *equipment*
now ' virtual dive ' will allow people to explore the site from their own homes
