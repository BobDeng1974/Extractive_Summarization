@entity0 , 31 , is said to have posed as an on - duty officer in @entity2			1
when this photograph was taken , @entity0 was a @entity4 with @entity5 @entity7 footage of a street brawl allegedly involving @entity10 captain @entity9 was seized by an off - duty police officer as a ' as a tool for blackmail ' , a court heard			1
@entity9 was out with friends celebrating his testimonial match at a wine bar in @entity18 , @entity2 , when trouble flared			0
@entity0 , 33 , who worked for @entity20 for eight years , was on a career break when she used her warrant card at a bank in @entity18 to obtain footage of the dispute			1
a court today heard how there was an ' irresistible inference ' that @entity29 took the footage on behalf of others intent on blackmailing the @entity10 and @entity34 star			1
@entity29 , of @entity35 , @entity36 , has admitted misconduct at @entity38 but the prosecution rejects @entity29 's account that she was unaware of any criminal purpose behind obtaining the recording			1
describing the events that were captured on camera on august 4 , @entity46 , prosecuting , said : ' the professional footballer @entity9 , and it will not need me to remind the court of his position and status , was celebrating his testimonial match on an evening out in @entity18 with a group of friends at @entity55 in @entity56			2
' the group included a man called @entity59			0
in the course of the late evening there was a dispute between mr @entity9 's group of friends and another group and it moved out on to @entity56 , outside @entity65 where an altercation was captured on cctv which showed the involvement of a man called @entity69			0
' @entity71 's case remains that mr @entity9 was seeking to avoid any involvement , or any form of aggression or confrontation , and as far as he was concerned was attempting to defuse the situation			0
' on august 8 , three days later , @entity29 went to @entity65 on @entity56 and asked to speak to the manager , @entity77			0
she retrieved the footage after showing her warrant card and telling the bank manager that she was in plain clothes because ' the job i do , no people would talk to me '			1
the prosecution said that a phone call made through a @entity2 @entity20 call operator to @entity65 at @entity29 's request was to ' provide a smokescreen ' and ' add authenticity ' to her actions			0
@entity7 : the video is alleged to show a dispute involving former @entity34 captain @entity9 ( left , in 2007 ) , his wife @entity98 ( right ) and another man mr @entity46 added : ' in the weeks that followed mr @entity69 contacted mr @entity59 and arranged a meeting of the two men			2
' @entity69 showed mr @entity103 of the incident on a laptop , gave his interpretation of the footage and requested mr @entity59 relay this to mr @entity9			2
' the only copy of the @entity7 had been provided to the defendant ( @entity29 )			0
it could not have been obtained by anyone else but the defendant			0
' @entity69 said he had been offered a substantial amount of money by the press for his story			1
' the court heard that @entity9 's and @entity10 's solicitor was later contacted by the head of press at @entity122 to say that @entity124 newspaper had been provided with a copy of the footage			1
@entity29 is said to have pretended she was on - duty in order to get the footage from a bank in the village of @entity18 , @entity2 ( above ) mr @entity46 added : ' whether that is right or wrong is perhaps unimportant ... but it was reported to the police and an investigation got under way as to how the @entity7 had passed into the hands , ostensibly , of a civilian			1
those enquiries led to the defendant , who by this time was in @entity142 , being arrested on october 2 , 2013			0
' @entity29 at first denied any knowledge of any of the parties involved , handling the footage or entering the bank			1
she claimed that she was in @entity10 with her niece on the day the footage was seized			2
it was only in september this year , days before her trial was due to begin , that @entity29 admitted taking the footage , saying she acted out of concern for someone who had claimed to have been assaulted by a group ' that included a well - known individual ' who intended to use it for ' civil redress through the courts if necessary '			2
footballer : @entity9 ( right ) in action for @entity10 against @entity162 in a @entity164 match at @entity165			0
@entity162 player @entity166 is pictured ( left ) , but is not related to this case she claimed in a defence statement : ' i had been assured that there was no intention to use any evidence criminally			0
i was n't made aware that the recording may be offered to the press			1
' @entity29 was due to give evidence later as her defence team argued that she was unaware of any criminal purpose to be carried out by others with the film			1
but mr @entity46 added : ' the nature of what 's being sought , the individuals who are alleged to have been involved in the incident which took place and the means by which this defendant was asked to obtain the item concerned , gives rise to the inference that ultimately this item would be used as a tool to blackmail parties involved in the incident of august 4			2
' @entity29 was suspended from duty and then resigned in december last year			0
