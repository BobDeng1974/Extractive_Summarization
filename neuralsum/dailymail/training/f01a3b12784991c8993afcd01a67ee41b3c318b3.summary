by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:43 est , 17 february 2014 a new explosion in traffic fines may have started today after a council revealed it is the first to use automated cctv to catch drivers making banned turns or illegally using yellow - box junctions			1
@entity10 in east @entity11 insists its new system will tackle ' serious traffic contraventions ' but critics say it is another way of ' harvesting ' money from motorists			1
currently drivers breaking the rules must be seen on camera by an operator , either live or after watching back video , before issuing the £ 130 fine			1
now cameras at four junctions will automatically detect if there has been a banned turn or a yellow - box encroachment , and then use number plate recognition to identify the vehicle			1
fine regime : a @entity11 borough has become the first in @entity34 to use automatic cctv to catch drivers who stop in box junctions like this one eye in the sky : drivers who carry out illegal turns at junctions will also be snared automatically in a move that could kick - start an avalanche of new fines , experts fear its makers boast that the system will ' capture more offences ' and ' deliver a higher return on investment '			1
@entity10 council 's environment , transportation and crime committee head , @entity56 , said : ' the system was installed to counter the high number of drivers that were ignoring the traffic restrictions that were in place , causing severe safety hazards to pedestrians and other drivers			1
' the system is working well and we have captured a number of vehicles committing serious traffic contraventions , which is promising			0
' the company behind the system , @entity73 , uses advanced camera technology known as @entity75 ( automatic number plate recognition ) to capture drivers breaching traffic laws			1
@entity73 says its technology can read numberplates that were blind to old @entity75 systems - for example , if they were dirty or had been sprayed with non-reflective paint			0
the system has been installed using a ‘ capital expenditure neutral ’ model , which sees all costs recovered through the issuing of penalty charge notices ( @entity90 )			2
it automates the detection and capture of moving traffic offences , and comes up with ' validation processing ' of the evidence data			2
this is then automatically posted to the back office system that issues the @entity90			0
the firm claims a study showed its scheme detected 2 per cent more vehicles over a 90 - minute period , compared to a normal @entity75 system without its new camera technology			0
it promises that the system ‘ will deliver a higher return on investment and compliance whilst increasing road safety wherever it is deployed '			2
motoring groups have worries about the new system , especially because councils may decide to fit the systems on junctions likely to produce more fines			1
@entity120 president @entity119 said : ' we are concerned that this automated system is more about harvesting motorists for money and profit than deterring bad driver behaviour			0
' there needs to be the safeguard that , if this system starts fining drivers on an industrial scale , an analysis of the problem junctions takes place			2
the ticket haul may be partly down to the road layout			0
' there is also the added concern that , if signing is inadequate , local drivers may learn to be wary but outsiders may be caught time after time for mistakes , minor infringements or circumstances outside their control , such as making way for emergency vehicles			0
' @entity150 head of external affairs @entity148 said : ' it is very worrying to hear mention of a phrase like ' will deliver a higher return on investment ' in association with a new type of moving traffic offence enforcement camera as it automatically makes you think the council is investing to make money rather than to change driver behaviour			0
' common sense needs to be applied with a new system like this to avoid creating a situation similar to @entity169 's ' money box junction ' ( in south @entity11 ) where a camera has been positioned in a place where there are clearly issues with the design and layout of the road which leads to motorists repeatedly being caught out			2
expansion : @entity34 's camera network already uses similar technology for speed offences but now it has been extended to several junctions ' if drivers are blatantly ignoring signage , then something needs to be done , but fairness should be key in the use of cameras like these			1
' it is encouraging , however , to hear that footage will be reviewed before penalty charge notices are issued as this will hopefully prevent some accidental driver errors being unfairly penalised			0
' in use at four locations , the system has been designed by the @entity73 company and can also catch drivers ignoring restricted access signs			0
according to the company , its system combines video analytics and @entity75 ( automatic number plate recognition ) detection to ' capture more offences than can be achieved by traditional legacy solutions and will deliver a higher return on investment and compliance whilst increasing road safety wherever it is deployed ' .			1

@entity10 in east @entity11 has installed new cameras at four junctions
it will detect if drivers have stopped or turned illegally and issue £ 130 fine
*previously* any offences had to be recorded and then seen by an operative
motoring groups fear it could lead to an avalanche of new fines for drivers
designers : ' system will capture more offences and deliver higher returns '
