@entity0 ended with the most tremendous , tetchy – tearful ! – squabble : should speaker @entity3 's future be decided by secret ballot ? it became a day of wondrous hysteria , tantrums , moist hankies and survival for this stinker of a speaker			1
@entity13 and a handful of men on the @entity16 insisted that a secret ballot would be ' undemocratic '			1
moderate @entity18 and @entity20 argued that @entity13 openly voting against @entity3 feared the @entity22 's tyrannical vengeance crashing about their ears			1
by the end , @entity3 was blubbing with relief , while his friend ( and possible successor ) @entity47 was wailing that some beastly , beastly men had not been entirely clear with him beforehand			1
boo hoo ! mr @entity47 is so widely seen as a @entity3 stooge , it may not be surprising that he was kept out of the loop by @entity3 's enemies			1
his chin - crumpling speech , in which he said he preferred to be thought an honest fool than a clever schemer , was greeted with frenetic clapping from @entity58			0
it was soon being compared to the @entity60 , @entity61 's ' fight them on the beaches ' speech , the @entity64			0
@entity13 and @entity3 's @entity18 nutjobs waved their order papers and accused commons leader @entity67 of being a @entity69 dictator			1
@entity70 leapt in the air , brandishing their pleasure and accusing the secret ballot crowd of being ' grubby ' and ' partisan '			1
@entity75 supporters had been taken by surprise on wednesday evening by a cunning ploy from @entity79 's very own baldrick , government chief whip @entity78			0
a secret ballot may have looked harmless			1
we all have one in the coming general election			0
' @entity13 and @entity3 's @entity18 nutjobs waved their order papers and accused commons leader @entity67 ( pictured ) of being a @entity69 dictator ' but @entity58 – which regards @entity3 as a client speaker – saw that a secret ballot would give its own mps the cloak of anonymity			1
that would make them impossible to whip			0
@entity13 were therefore hauled back from the furthest ends of the kingdom to save the speaker for socialism			1
at this point you will say ' well , naturally @entity3 must have let one of his deputies chair the debate , as it would have been improper for him to supervise it himself '			1
you do not know this man			0
of course he chaired it ! and he did so in the most hilariously biased fashion , calling a succession of his mates			0
@entity58 delayed the debate , thus allowing its troops to get back from their constituencies			2
how did they do this ? by asking the speaker to give them urgent questions			2
three , to be precise			0
each of these devices use up precious time and made @entity3 's survival more likely			1
a @entity18 moderate , @entity122 ( @entity123 ) , muttered ' oh , rubbish ' while one of mr @entity3 's supporters was speaking			2
a smiling @entity3 snarled at mr @entity122 that ' it is better to remain silent and look a fool than to remove any doubt '			2
this was an authentic @entity131 moment – that combination of sneer and fake amusement catching his character perfectly			0
sir @entity137 ( lab , @entity139 ) , in a @entity141 - check suit that will have made tv screens wobble , made a @entity144 speech of such acidity , it must have corroded the pinky gums at the bottom of his ancient , yellowing fangs			0
sir @entity137 is likely to be the next @entity150 and will therefore be in charge of the @entity152 when it has a chance to approve @entity3 's continued existence in the chair			2
how convenient ! was yesterday 's plot driven by partisanship ? it was certainly driven by hatred of @entity3 , who was elected in 2009 amid sly partisanship by @entity58			2
the once great chair of our elected @entity163 has never looked so tawdry			0
the @entity18 should run a candidate against @entity131 in @entity166			0

mps voted on ' secret ballot ' to unseat @entity3 as commons speaker
@entity13 and some on right said such a vote would be undemocratic
he fought back tears as the motion was defeated by 228 votes to 202
the *announcement* was met with *rapturous* applause by labour mps
