@entity1 broadcasters @entity0 have pulled off a coup by persuading the injured @entity3 and @entity5 defender @entity4 to be part of their panel for tonight 's important tie between @entity11 's men and @entity12 at @entity13			1
@entity4 has been ruled out the first leg because of a knock to his quad muscle and will join 1980s @entity3 legend @entity17 for the live television coverage to see if his side can salvage some respect for the @entity21 after a dismal @entity23 campaign for our leading clubs			1
@entity4 takes a free - kick for @entity3 against @entity27 earlier in the season manager @entity11 oversees @entity3 training at @entity30 on wednesday @entity3 may be the only @entity31 club who will end up qualifying for the quarter - finals of either @entity23 competition			2
@entity35 crashed out of the @entity36 against @entity37 on wednesday while both @entity38 and @entity39 have to overturn first - leg deficits when they travel to @entity41 and @entity42 next week			0
@entity11 's side are the only @entity31 survivors in the @entity1 following exits for @entity46 and @entity47 in the last round and @entity0 have chosen to show the match from @entity13 on their main channel @entity50 rather than @entity51 where most @entity1 games are screened			1
@entity53 and @entity54 will commentate with presenter @entity55 – who recently replaced @entity57 – joined by @entity4 and @entity17			2
@entity4 , 30 , rarely does interviews but is known to hold thoughtful and incisive views on football			0
a huge music fan , he disembarked from the plane that brought back @entity5 's players from last summer 's @entity64 clutching a guitar he had taken with him to @entity67			0
baines with his guitar at the @entity64 ( left ) and against @entity70 earlier this season the left - back , who was wanted by @entity73 at the start of last season before he signed a new contract with @entity3 , has only played once since the end of january because of injury and received a knock to the quad muscle on his leg last month			1
he has returned to training though and may make his return in sunday 's @entity21 game against @entity87			0
@entity3 have so far saved their most impressive performances for @entity89 and qualified for the knockout stages from a difficult group that included @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
@entity12 are managed by former @entity47 and @entity95 forward @entity96 ( above )			0
