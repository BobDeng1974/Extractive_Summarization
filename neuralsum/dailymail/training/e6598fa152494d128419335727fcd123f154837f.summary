rescuing four people from a car crash might seem like a pretty heroic act , but @entity3 , son of former presidential candidate @entity4 , has received a large amount of flak since tweeting about his apparent heroics on @entity8 night			1
@entity3 , 38 , posted a message to nearly 20,000 followers on friday morning , complete with a goofy photo of him grinning in front of an overturned @entity13 and destroyed home in @entity15			2
the real estate developer has since received a large amount of online mockery after writing : ' was first on scene to big accident , see pic of car in the house			2
i lifted 4 people out to safety			0
' @entity28 : @entity3 was mocked after posting this photo of him grinning in front of a wrecked car and ruined house and accused of attempting a ' humblebrag ' @entity3 has upset the twitter - verse by breaking one of the cardinal sins of the medium and using the situation to post a ‘ humblebrag , ’ a tweet which attempts to boast about something while at the same time trying to mask it as something altogether more self - effacing			1
' who tweets a pictures of themselves at the science of a car accident ! ? ! desperate for attention , much ? ' , tweeted one critic , while another asked : ' why are you smiling like a tourist at such a horrific scene ? ' two other commenters added ' who but a member of the @entity3 family would pose for pictures , smiling , to brag about something like this ? ' and ' i ca n't figure out what 's worse ... the mangled car & destroyed home , or that smile at a car crash			1
' for many it was @entity3 's use of the word ‘ i ’ in his tweet that made it such an obvious attempt at a ‘ humblebrag			1
’ humble ? @entity3 rescued four victims of a car crash on @entity8 night , and then tweeted about it @entity80 : @entity3 ( left ) and his family support @entity82 during a rally in @entity84 in february 2012 the phrase ‘ humblebrag ’ , stems from the words humble and bragging and was first coined by @entity88 comedian @entity87 in 2011			1
he subsequently set up the @entity92 account @entity93 ; to retweet what he considers the worst - offending ' humblebrags ' mainly from celebrities			0
a ‘ humblebrag , ’ is considered by many @entity92 users to be an even worse offense than overt bragging , because the user is attempting to have it both ways – to tell everyone about something amazing that they ’re doing , while also attempting to appear self - effacing and unpretentious			1
the ' humblebrag ' is not limited to celebrities and has become an all - too - familiar phenomenon that most people will have noticed friends and family posting on their @entity114 feed or on @entity92			1
here are some examples of terrible ' humblebrags ' : @entity3 , who has been mentioned as a possible future political candidate in @entity118 , also posted the photo on @entity114 where he received more than a hundred comments , many positive ones calling him a hero , but some saying things like ‘ what a self - serving ghoul … ’ and ‘ no [ sic ] another @entity3 fabrication			1
’ @entity128 ’s exact role in the rescue has also been called into question by someone else who was at the scene			0
@entity133 , a neighbor who heard the wreck and called 911 , told @entity135 he did n't notice @entity3 because there were a lot of people on scene when the crash happened , and they were more focused on the people in the car than those helping them get out			1
@entity3 's twitter account has been all quiet since he posted about the crash on friday			1
the @entity147 reported that the vehicle left @entity149 215 on 4500 @entity150 and went straight through an intersection before smashing into the home , where no one was hurt			0
unified police lieutenant @entity154 said that the accident had left the house ' unlivable			0
' in a statement on friday , @entity3 explained he was driving home with wife @entity159 and their three children after the family @entity8 dinner when he stopped at the intersection			2
familiar pose : @entity3 gestures during his father 's failed presidential campaign last year ' just then , a vehicle traveling at highway speed passed narrowly by my car , through the intersection and into the kitchen of a home across the street , ' he said			2
' i drove to the accident site and entered the home where the car had come to a stop on its side			0
i opened the car door and spoke with the four passengers inside the car			0
' miraculously , they appeared to have no major injuries			0
i was able to help each of them get out of the car and lift them down to the ground , ' @entity3 added			2
the second son of last year 's presidential candidate said that he was grateful that no one was seriously injured , glad to have been able to help and he did what anyone else would have done in the same situation			0
police are still looking into the cause of the accident , but believe it may have been caused by the driver suffering a seizure while at the wheel .			0

@entity3 is facing growing criticism over his *decision* to tweet about helping to pull four people from a car crash on *thursday* night
he has been accused of using the good dead to boost his public *profile* in the form of an attempted ' humblebrag '
a ' humblebrag ' is a tweet where someone posts about something they wish to boast about , but try to do so in a self - effacing manner
