by @entity0 the old brigade are being pointed towards the exit at @entity3 , and @entity4 is happy enough to be included among the veterans who have been made surplus to requirements by @entity9 manager @entity8			2
the long - serving left - back may not be quite so pleased , however , to discover that age has counted against him over where he goes next			0
@entity15 had him on their list of full - back targets , along with @entity20 ’s @entity19 , as they formulated plans to make at least three signings this summer			1
surplus to requirements : @entity4 is expected to leave @entity9 , but may not end up at @entity15 snub : @entity19 has decided not to make the move to @entity15 @entity19 ’s decision to snub them , revealed in the @entity27 earlier this week , appeared to leave the way clear for @entity4 to complete a dream move to the @entity30			1
but in a change of policy , new @entity15 president @entity31 has ruled that @entity4 , who turns 33 in may , is too old to be part of their recruitment drive			1
@entity31 wants the accent to be on youth , and it now seems likely that 19 - year old @entity39 will be given a chance at left - back after spending a successful season on loan at @entity44			0
the new approach leaves @entity4 pinning his hopes on @entity47 and @entity48 for a fresh start in the summer			0
@entity50 : @entity15 may turn to @entity39 , 19 , who has impressed on loan at @entity44 new look : @entity8 will have to revamp his whole defence this summer @entity54 is beginning to talk up @entity56 ’s prospects of overhauling @entity20 for the fourth champions ’ @entity59 spot with good reason – it holds the key to securing @entity63 on a permanent deal at the end of the season			1
@entity67 are likely to listen to offers for @entity63 in the summer , and @entity69 are showing a strong interest in taking him to @entity72			0
but the big @entity74 striker has settled in well on and off the pitch at @entity76 and would not take much persuading to turn his season - long loan into a permanent deal			2
permanent : @entity56 qualifying for the @entity59 could encourage @entity63 to sign a permanent deal falling out : @entity63 angered @entity83 earlier this season by saying he would consider staying at @entity56 after upsetting @entity67 boss @entity83 earlier this season by saying ‘ stay at @entity56 – why not ? ’ , he is wary of going public with his thoughts			1
but he has evidently made it clear in private that his dream would be to play champions ’ @entity59 football in the blue of @entity56 next season			2
@entity54 would have to spend a large chunk of his £ 20million budget on making it happen , but no - one could dispute it would be money well spent after his impact so far on @entity98			0
chasing : @entity54 is hot on the heels of @entity20 for the final @entity59 spot nervy : @entity20 are six points clear of @entity56 but have played a game more - the two teams also play each other @entity106 is facing the galling prospect of being pipped by @entity108 once more in a scramble for one of @entity112 ’s up - and - coming prospects			1
after heading for the @entity115 last summer , as replacement for the sacked @entity114 , he was desperate to return to his old club @entity116 for attacking midfielder @entity117			0
it became a straight fight with @entity108 , which @entity106 lost when the highly - rated playmaker headed for @entity121 in a £ 24million deal			1
@entity123 : @entity106 may miss out on @entity124 ( below ) with @entity108 fighting for his signature hot property : @entity128 has dazzled in the @entity129 now the emerging talent in question is 18 - year old @entity132 winger @entity124 , and @entity106 once more has his work cut out			1
the city manager is a huge admirer of @entity124 ’s dazzling wing play and feels he would have little difficulty adapting to the @entity138			0
but worrying for him , @entity108 are already on the case and making plans to meet the teenager ’s £ 3.3million release clause			0
it goes up to £ 7.4million next year , but @entity108 are confident of acting before then and seeing off competition from a host of top @entity147 clubs headed by @entity134			2
selection : @entity117 decided to choose @entity108 rather than join @entity106 in @entity149 @entity150 has stayed loyal to @entity151 throughout this season ’s escalating crisis and continued providing the sharpest of cutting edges , despite bids for him being rejected from the likes of @entity159 , @entity134 and @entity160			1
he kept giving his all , even when @entity159 and @entity161 had £ 5million deadline - day offers rebuffed in the january window and throughout the ensuing fiasco of manager @entity165 being sacked and reinstated in the space of 24 hours , amid uncertainty over who owned the club			0
his days at @entity171 do appear numbered , however , with several clubs jostling for position ahead of a summer scramble to sign him			2
exit : @entity151 's star man @entity150 is being chased by a number of clubs turmoil : @entity151 are currently stuck in a financial crisis with players not being paid on time @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 are leading the way , but @entity151 may just have missed the boat over raking in some much - needed cash			1
mindful of the @entity194 ’s parlous state , with the threat of administration hanging over them , the three @entity191 suitors are likely to offer only a fraction of the @entity201 striker ’s original valuation .			0

@entity4 may not move to @entity15 as new president wants to look to youth
@entity63 may move to @entity56 on a permanent deal - but only if they can beat @entity20 to the fourth @entity59 spot
@entity106 facing another fight with @entity108 , this time over @entity132 winger @entity124
several clubs are jostling to sign @entity151 hotshot @entity150
