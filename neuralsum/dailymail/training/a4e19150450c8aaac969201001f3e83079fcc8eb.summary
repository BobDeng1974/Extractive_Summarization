@entity0 are prepared to offer @entity1 a staggering £ 12.4million a year , after tax , to take over from @entity3 at the end of the season			1
though the @entity7 manager has turned down overtures from @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity0 have been encouraged by the uncertainty surrounding his future at the @entity13 and are ready to tempt him with a salary equivalent to £ 22m in the @entity15 — three times the £ 7.5m he currently earns			1
on his way ? @entity0 hope to tempt @entity1 with a massive offer at the end of the season @entity0 are desperate to bring a celebrated manager to the club when they compete in the @entity23 next season , having secured qualification last weekend			1
but while former @entity26 boss @entity3 has proved a success in winning promotion and securing @entity23 football , they remain 10 points behind leaders @entity10			0
@entity33 owner @entity32 is expected to dismiss him this month and is seeking to appoint one of @entity37 ’s elite managers			0
for @entity1 it would provide an emotional return to the club he managed from 1987 to 1994 , when he was sacked despite having taken them to the @entity23 semi-final			2
however , it would also represent a considerable u-turn in his philosophy about football , given he has been critical of @entity26 ’s oligarch - funded success , labelling it ‘ financial doping			0
’ and there are huge issues surrounding @entity0 ’s lavish spending and @entity37 ’s new financial fair play regulations			2
but @entity0 have been emboldened by @entity1 ’s reluctance to sign a new @entity7 contract , which runs out this year			1
doubts : @entity0 's @entity33 owner @entity32 is expected to dismiss @entity3 this month not good enough : @entity0 have qualified for @entity23 but remain 10 points behind leaders @entity10 he has said his future will not be determined by the result of the @entity65 final and those who know @entity1 well believe it is more likely he will decide on the basis of whether the fans want him to continue			1
though @entity7 are planning their summer transfers and pre-season training on the basis that he will stay , even those close to the manager think he has yet to make up his mind			2
@entity1 , 64 , has said he has no other jobs on the horizon , and last night told @entity79 : ‘ i ’ve given my word to this club that i want to continue where i am ’			0
but were he to leave @entity7 , several clubs would be interested			0
emotional : @entity1 managed @entity0 from 1987 to 1994 and reached @entity23 semi-finals meanwhile , @entity84 will seek talks with @entity1 after the @entity65 final as he considers his future			1
the @entity87 striker has cut a frustrated figure , spending plenty of time warming the bench			0
an early - season hamstring injury that kept him out for four months has n’t helped , nevertheless @entity84 ’s lack of action is a major issue for the forward			0
the former @entity99 star has been back in @entity1 ’s plans in recent weeks , making five starts in succession and scoring four goals in the process			0
doubts : @entity7 striker @entity84 will seek assurances from @entity1 about his future but @entity84 fears he will be back on the bench next season , particularly when @entity109 returns from injury			1
the 28 - year - old will seek clarification before the @entity113 regarding @entity1 ’s plans for next season			2
@entity115 has also taken a step closer to leaving after @entity1 confirmed the @entity117 has not responded to the club ’s third and final contract offer			1
the right back ’s deal expires at the end of the season , with sources close to the player insisting @entity115 is ‘ almost certain ’ to go .			0

@entity0 want @entity1 to *replace* @entity3
the free - spending club would offer @entity1 £ 22m a year
@entity7 manager is yet to sign a new contract at the @entity13
