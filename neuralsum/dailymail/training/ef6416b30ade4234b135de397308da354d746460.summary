by @entity0 people are constantly advised to stay hydrated every day by drinking plenty of water			0
but sometimes time just slips away , and it can be hours before someone realises they ’ve forgotten to take just a sip			0
so with that in mind , @entity8 has invented a simple yet effective bottle cap with an in - built ‘ alarm ’ that you can set to remind you when to drink			1
at first glance it might look just like a regular bottle cap			1
many dieters attempt to fill themselves up with water in the belief it will help them lose weight			0
but one nutrition expert says it is simply a myth that drink water aids slimming			2
dr @entity30 , at the @entity29 , has stated that drinking water is not a magical key to weight loss			0
she said : ‘ there is very little evidence that drinking water promotes weight loss - it is one of those self - perpetuating myths			2
' but closer inspection remains the small ‘ timer ’ band beneath the top			0
to use the cap , it is screwed like normal onto the top of a regular bottle			1
when it is screwed in place , though , a timer is set in motion			2
after an hour it activates a little spring inside the cap the causes a flag at the top to pop up , grabbing a person ’s attention			1
the cap has been part of an experiment to see if it encourages people to hydrate more often			2
according to agency @entity59 , initial findings ‘ show people drank more water during the day and enjoyed it			0
’ as of yet there is no news as to whether this will be made commercial for the general public			0
the @entity15 , made by marketing agency @entity16 , is a top for a bottle with a difference ; a ' timer ' in the top reminds you to take a drink every hour the innovative cap can be screwed on to a regular bottle of water			1
a spring is activated after 60 minutes that flicks up a small flag ( shown ) to remind you to drink			1

@entity17 marketing agency @entity16 has designed a new bottle cap
the cap has an in - built timer that reminds you when to *rehydrate*
when it is screwed onto a regular water bottle a timer is activated
after an hour a spring causes a flag to ' ping ' up so you *remember* to drink
the cap was part of an experiment but no news on if it will come to market
