the @entity1 spacecraft has captured amazing new images of the mystery bright spots on the dwarf planet @entity5 , which continue to baffle scientists			1
in particular , the images show the brightest spot and its companion standing out against the darker surroundings			1
but experts are still at a loss to explain the composition and source of the bright spots			2
they reveal new views of the two brightest spots in a crater ( shown )			1
however , scientists are still not able to explain what they are			2
@entity1 will begin its first science orbit around @entity5 on 23 april these latest images were taken on 14 and 15 april from a distance of 14,000 miles ( 22,000km ) from the north pole of @entity5			1
several theories are currently being touted for what these mysterious bright white spots are on @entity5			1
the @entity34 has found more than 10 on the surface , but @entity5 has found that the two most prominent - ‘ spot 5 ’ - are in a crater about 57 miles ( 92km ) wide			1
one theory is that they are salt flats that are reflecting sunlight , left on the surface by saltwater			0
another theory is that they are regions of ice , again reflecting sunlight			0
@entity5 is thought to have plenty of ice beneath its surface , which could be exposed when a asteroid or comet strikes the surface			2
the fact these bright spots are in a crater - where such an impact occurred - supports this theory			2
another possibility is that they are cryovolcanoes - volcanoes that are shooting out water or ice			0
however , the lack of a raised area around the spots consistent with a volcano suggests this might not be correct			0
and they could even be water vapour ejecting from a liquid reservoir under the ground , although again current observations - namely a lack of additional material near the spots - suggests this is not the case			0
as the spacecraft gets closer to the dwarf planet and moves around it , more and more of the surface is coming into view			1
the two brightest spots seen in a crater are known as ‘ spot 5 ’			1
the scale in the image is about 1.3 miles ( 2.1km ) per pixel , almost 70 per cent better than previous images			0
but the origin of the bright spots remains a mystery for now - with theories ranging from exposed ice to volcanoes			0
@entity95 flats or ice seem to be the predominant theories at the moment , with the bright spots appearing to reflect incoming sunlight towards the spacecraft ’s cameras			0
until @entity1 gets closer , though , it ’s unlikely the mystery will be resolved			2
‘ it ’s too early to say what they are , ’ dr @entity102 , @entity1 's mission director and chief engineer , told @entity104			2
‘ some people have offered they might be ice , but i do n’t consider that necessarily the most likely explanation			0
’ dr @entity102 says he favours the theory that they could be ‘ salty deposits ' , left over from perhaps saltwater ’ on the surface			0
but one thing that can be ruled out is that they are their own sources of light			0
dr @entity102 is certain they are simply reflecting sunlight			0
‘ they ’re mysterious but not bizarre , ’ he said			0
this animation , made using new images taken by @entity1 , shows how the bright spots become visible when they pass the ' terminator ' - the line where the planet is split between sunlight and darkness			1
credit : @entity19 in this close up view , the two different spots can clearly be seen			2
several theories currently exist for what they might be , with the favoured being salt flats or ice - both reflecting sunlight @entity19 's @entity1 ( artist 's illustration shown ) made its way to @entity5 after leaving the asteroid @entity142 in 2012			1
there is high interest in the mission because @entity5 is seen as being a record of the early solar system , and may also have shifting ice on its surface @entity5 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			2
it is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity5 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			1
it lies less than three times as far as @entity160 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star , allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity19 's @entity1 made its way to @entity5 after leaving the asteroid @entity142 in 2012			1
there is high interest in the mission because @entity5 is seen as being a record of the early solar system , and may also have shifting ice on its surface			2
@entity1 continues to get closer to the dwarf planet and on 23 april it will descend to a circular orbit 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) above the surface			1
it will then begin its first mapping phase of the dwarf planet in this so - called science orbit , travelling from pole to pole to image the entire surface			1
three more science orbits are planned , with the spacecraft mapping the comet in increasing detail			0
up until december it will periodically descend lower and lower until it reaches an altitude of just 225 miles ( 260km ) above the surface , with images 100 times better than those taken so far			0
this is lower than the orbital height of the @entity191 around @entity160 – and will allow @entity1 to snap glorious images of @entity5 ’ surface , including its mysterious bright spots			1
these latest images ( close up view of the bright spots in the crater on the right ) were taken on 14 and 15 april from a distance of 14,000 miles ( 22,000km ) from the north pole of @entity5 @entity1 is continuing to get closer to the dwarf planet @entity5 ( position in the solar system shown left ) , and on 23 april it will descend to a circular orbit 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) above the surface - its first science orbit			1
three more are planned by the end of the year ( orbital paths shown right ) ‘ the approach imaging campaign has completed successfully by giving us a preliminary , tantalising view of the world @entity1 is about to start exploring in detail			0
it has allowed us to start asking some new and intriguing questions , ' said dr @entity102 said in a statement			0
@entity1 became the first spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet on 6 march , having left the giant asteroid @entity142 in 2012			1
both @entity142 and @entity5 are in the main asteroid belt between @entity223 and @entity224 , and were on their way to forming planets before their development was interrupted - likely by the gravity of @entity224 .			0

@entity19 scientists in @entity20 reveal new images of dwarf planet @entity5
they show new views of the two brightest spots in a crater
however , scientists are still not able to explain what they are
@entity1 will begin its first science orbit around @entity5 on 23 april
