by @entity0 three couples who married on the same day , in the same church , have together celebrated 180 years of marriage in what could be @entity6 's only combined triple diamond wedding anniversary			2
the trio of blushing brides and grooms had never met before they tied the knot in turn on march 30 , 1964 but have remained life - long friends ever since			1
@entity14 and @entity15 , both 70 , @entity13 and @entity16 , also 70 , and @entity17 , 71 , and wife @entity18 , 69 , went down the aisle within hours of one another			1
still in together after all these years : @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity13 and @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity22 ( left to right ) became lifelong friends after marrying on the same day at the same church fifty years ago the three couples remained friends and still live in the same town and their marriages endured - and they all met up last week to mark their six decades of marital bliss			1
mrs @entity16 said : ' we just feel blessed we are still here and able to celebrate			0
' i would imagine it is quite unusual for three couples to be celebrating 50 years together , and it is quite a milestone			0
' all six were born and raised in the pretty @entity35 town of @entity36			1
their wedding venue , tiny @entity38 , has long since been demolished but the three marriages are all rock solid after 50 years			1
their back - to back nuptials happened partly by chance because the frugal lovebirds wanted to take advantage of a tax break for married couples			0
with the financial perk due to run out on april 1 they were forced to book their weddings for the same day , with an hour 's interval between each service			0
special day : @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity13 and @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity22 , in the same order as above , were all wed at the now demolished @entity38 's in @entity36 , @entity35 50 years on they are still friends and met for a drink last week to celebrate their anniversaries			1
they then held larger celebrations with their own families in the town they love			0
@entity22 said : ' we met up and talked about old times in @entity36			2
' it was very nice because we all come from @entity36 and we are all born and bred here			0
' we just feel blessed we are still here and able to celebrate '			0
the longevity of their marriages is remarkable			0
in 1964 one in 12 ended in divorce			2
today one in two marriages ends in divorce			1
