by @entity0 @entity1 has labelled @entity2 as ' selfish ' for not talking up @entity4 's chances of winning the @entity5			1
the former @entity4 batsman used his @entity8 column to add his voice to the growing number of former players questioning @entity2 's leadership of the one - day side			2
@entity4 may have beaten @entity14 by 41 runs on friday to avoid a series whitewash , but @entity1 is still frustrated by what he sees as a negative attitude in the one - day set up			1
' in @entity2 's own words it is ' far fetched ' to believe we can win the tournament			0
i just do not buy that			0
it is also nonsense to think we do not have time to make changes that could transform @entity4 's chances			2
' @entity1 revealed that the lack of positivity going into next year 's tournament is especially galling after the @entity38 schedule was amended to improve @entity4 's chances			1
' there is a theory the @entity4 are reluctant to remove @entity2 as captain of the one - day team because it might destabilise the camp ahead of next year 's ashes , ' he added			1
' that is hard to swallow for those of us who endured back - to - back @entity38 campaigns just so this winter could be dedicated to one - day cricket in the lead - up to the @entity5			0
' too little too late : @entity4 averted a whitewash by beating @entity14 in their final one - day match at @entity55 although @entity2 came through similar doubts about his suitability to lead the @entity59 side earlier this summer , @entity1 believes his style fundamentally does not fit in with what is required in the shorter form of the game			1
the 34 - year - old , who also suggested @entity66 stars should spend time in the @entity68 to hone their limited overs skills , has joined @entity70 and @entity71 in suggesting he should just focus on the @entity59			2
he said : ' this is not a witch - hunt against @entity2			0
but he would gain a lot of respect if he admitted he is not the right man to open the batting and captain the one - day team , and decided he was going to concentrate all his efforts on winning back the @entity38			0
' pick and choose : @entity70 is one of several players to suggest that @entity2 concentrates on test cricket			0

@entity84 has talked down @entity4 's hopes of winning @entity5
@entity1 has labelled captain 's negative attitude as ' selfish '
@entity4 avoided whitewash by beating @entity14 in final *odi* at @entity55
@entity70 and @entity71 think @entity2 should focus on tests
