by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's form going into the @entity4 is an ongoing concern for @entity6 , with @entity7 intimating that his move to @entity9 has n't worked out			1
the 25 - year - old was in and out for the @entity11 during his first season in the @entity13 since @entity14 splashed £ 42million on him from @entity15			1
it can often take foreign imports - regardless of how highly thought of they are - time to adapt to @entity20 football and @entity3 has expressed his surprise at the domestic intensity			2
@entity3 is a playmaker they need , and have relied on in previous tournaments , with @entity7 hopeful he will click into gear			2
' it ’s difficult to say where his head is going to be at the @entity4 , ' the former captain told the @entity45			0
' he has done well for @entity6 and he played well during the qualifying campaign but in the last few months - since his move to @entity9 - he has not been the same player , in terms of his confidence , that we used to see in the national team			1
' i do n’t know whether the @entity9 move has affected him because he was untouchable and in @entity6 we still expect him to be one of our best players			1
' as one of our best players he has to take more responsibility , and we expect more from him at the moment			0
hopefully , when the @entity4 starts , we will see a different player			0
' they have n't enjoyed ideal preparation for @entity26 after disappointing draws against @entity61 and then @entity62			0
@entity3 played in behind the striker in the latter but failed to exert much of an impact			0
given @entity33 's decision to take @entity67 as his only genuine striker , @entity3 must begin to deliver			0
' i saw him play for the national team at the weekend and i was not surprised , not scared , but a little bit concerned , by his performances , ' @entity7 admitted .			1

@entity3 *signed* for the @entity11 for £ 42m from @entity15 last season
the 25 - year - old *struggled* for @entity6 in a *friendly* against @entity62
@entity7 admitted he does n't know whether @entity9 move has affected him
@entity3 should be key part of @entity6 's @entity4 team
