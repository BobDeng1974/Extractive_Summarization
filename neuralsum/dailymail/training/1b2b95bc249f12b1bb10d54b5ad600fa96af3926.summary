' i do n't know whether it 's the @entity3 effect , but the number of incidents involving items like handcuffs seems to have gone up			1
' i 'm sure most people will be fifty shades of red by the time our crews arrive to free them			0
' the @entity16 has attended more than 1,300 incidents involving people being trapped or stuck , often in everyday household items , since 2010			1
each incident costs taxpayers at least £ 290 , meaning they have cost at least £ 377,000			1

action - packed : the @entity16 ( some crew members pictured ) has attended more than 1,300 incidents involving people being trapped or stuck , often in everyday household items , since 2010 ' when firefighters are out attending to some of these avoidable incidents , someone else could be in real need of emergency assistance			1

' the @entity16 said its crews are called to more than one incident every day involving someone trapped or stuck			1
people getting into a jam with rings , bracelets and watches are a common occurrence , while firefighters are also regularly called to assist people and children with their fingers trapped in electrical items like washing machines , sewing machines and heaters			0
the most common type of callout for this type of incident is to people with rings stuck on their fingers , which accounted for almost 500 over the last three years			1
' our advice is simple , ' said a @entity16 spokesman			2
' if the ring does n't fit , do n't force it on			0
' as well as being painful , you could end up wasting emergency service time if you have to call us out			0
' despite the unusual nature of some of the incidents , the @entity16 was keen to stress that people should always call 999 in the case of a genuine emergency .			2
