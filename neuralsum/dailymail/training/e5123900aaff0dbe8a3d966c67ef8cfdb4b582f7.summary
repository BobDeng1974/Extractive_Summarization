by @entity0 a @entity2 widow has managed to save a piece of sidewalk that her late husband used to declared his love for her more than 52 years ago			1
@entity7 scrawled an affectionate message to his wife @entity9 - then @entity10 - on a piece of freshly poured concrete along @entity13 in @entity14 when they were just 12 years old			1
@entity7 sadly died in 2008 , but his love note was recently rescued amid road work and lives on in @entity9 's backyard as a symbol of the couple 's enduring love			1
@entity9 said there was an instant connection when she first met @entity7 , who lived just two doors down , at a friend 's ' boy - girl party			1
' saved : @entity27 looks up as she kneels next to a section of sidewalk in which @entity7 wrote ' @entity30 ' more than 50 years ago , at her home june 2 , 2014 , in @entity33 , @entity2			2
his eventual wife -- and now widow -- recently received the section of the sidewalk ' i ca n't say it was love			2
i was 12 , ' she told @entity41 and @entity42 , ' but i was totally infatuated with him			0
' @entity7 felt the same way , and expressed his love by writing ' @entity7 ' in the sidewalk near @entity47 soon after			1
when @entity7 left for military school in @entity50 , the couple kept in touch and rekindled their romance during holidays and summer breaks			1
they were reunited when both attended the @entity58 and they married soon after graduating			0
@entity9 and @entity7 had a baby before returning to @entity14 and buying a house on @entity47 , just a block away from @entity7 's message			1
when their family grew to two children and four grandchildren , the sentimental sidewalk remained , becoming a go - to place for family pictures			2
their daughter , @entity70 , told the @entity42 the story of the sidewalk is one of her earliest childhood memories			0
' i remember thinking , " @entity77 , you were dating when you were 12 ? " that 's a little crazy , is n't it ? ' she told the newspaper when @entity7 died in early 2008 after a battle with myeloma , the sidewalk took on even greater importance to the family			1
so when @entity70 drove past it recently and saw orange tape surrounding the site , her heart sank			0
she returned straight after work and found the sidewalk was broken but the message intact			0
she then contacted @entity95 to see if the family could have it , and officials said ' sure ' - but only if the family could move it			0
so @entity70 's brother @entity99 arranged to have a 5 - inch thick chunk cut and transported to his mother 's house			2
a grateful @entity9 placed the stone between her home and garage , where she sees it every day			0
she told the newspaper that while she misses her husband everyday , she considers herself blessed			0
' how many people go their whole lives looking for someone to love ? and i had that love from age 12			0

@entity7 scrawled ' @entity7 *+* @entity9 ' on a piece of freshly poured concrete along @entity13 in @entity14 for a young @entity10
the couple went on to marry , have two children , four grandchildren and a long life together
@entity7 sadly died in 2008 after a battle with myeloma
but his love note was recently rescued amid road work and the *5inch* thick slab of concrete now lives on in @entity9 's backyard as a symbol of their love
