by @entity0 they are calling it the greatest cherry harvest ever , with the trees leaning over , drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit			1
pickers are working every daylight hour in @entity10 and @entity11			0
after a campaign to revive @entity14 cherry farming , this most luscious of fruits is back and — thanks to this year ’s weather — yields are nearly treble those of 2012			1
the cherry - growing harvest is expected to be worth £ 20 million , up from just £ 7.5 million last year , and the season is set to last longer than ever , well into september			1
‘ last year we picked 100 tonnes			1
this year we expect to pick 250 , ’ says @entity22 , a third generation cherry farmer from @entity10			1
the greatest cherry harvest ever ? trees are leaning over , drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit and pickers are working throughout the day in @entity10 and @entity11 ‘ this season has been great for us due to the dry weather and plenty of light , but we also had a very cold winter , which cherry trees like because they can hibernate			1
’ cold and frosty weather allows the trees to ‘ shut down ’ and build reserves of energy for blossoming and fruit			1
it also kills pests and fungus that can wreck harvests			0
@entity22 leads me along a neat line of cherry trees being harvested on her family ’s farm near @entity53			1
the @entity55 ’ orchards are planted in small , hedgerow - lined fields , with tall poplars acting as windbreaks			1
dry weather and plenty of light after a cold spell are ideal conditions as cherry trees can hibernate in winter at one end are the beehives , home to the all - important pollinators			1
on every tree , perfectly firm and shiny cherries in varying shades of crimson are decadently large			1
each bunch , the size of a man ’s hand , must weigh a pound			0
and between the glossy dark leaves , there are at least one hundred bunches on every tree			0
the pickers , wearing traditional leather - belted wicker baskets around their hips , bury themselves among the leaves to get to the fruit			1
‘ we only pick fruit that has reached the right shade — the colour tells you how ripe the fruit is , ’ says @entity22			1
‘ cherries continue to ripen after picking , but only a little , so it ’s important to pick them when they are perfect			1
’ seven years ago , the @entity55 ’ farm had 30 acres of old cherry trees , but they mainly grew apples and pears			1
@entity100 farming had dramatically declined			0
where there had been 5,000 hectares of cherry orchards in @entity10 at the beginning of the 20th century , by the end there were just 600			1
‘ the fruit was small and the quality low			2
the supermarkets were buying cheap fruit from @entity110 , ’ says @entity22			2
after we joined the @entity112 , @entity14 fruit growers , who did not get an agricultural subsidy , found they could not compete with cheaper imports			1
thousands of acres of cherry orchards were destroyed			2
a cherry picker at work			2
@entity22 , also a cherry farmer , from @entity10 , says : ' i think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are			2
i just love to come to work every day ' ( picture posed by model ) supermarkets used to be full of cheap fruit from @entity110 , but there 's a renewed interest in homegrown food ten years ago , with a new interest in home - grown produce and the @entity135 campaign led by @entity136 of the crusading @entity138 movement , farmers looked again at cherry farming			1
@entity140 , director of research for @entity142 , says that the old way of farming cherries had to go			2
we needed to adopt the practices of @entity110 , @entity148 and @entity149 growers in order to compete			1
‘ in @entity10 ’s orchards , we grew huge trees , so long wooden ladders were needed for picking , ’ he says			0
‘ it was picturesque , but it was just not practical			0
with today ’s health and safety considerations , pruning and picking would be impossible			0
’ the trees in the @entity55 ’ new orchards are small			0
just before they blossom , they are enclosed by metal frames covered with rain - proof plastic and netting at the sides to protect the fruit from its great enemy — birds			1
@entity171 , pictured , led the @entity173 campaign which energised farmers to look at cherry farming again the @entity177 dwarf rootstock that the @entity55 planted in 2006 is @entity148 : the bushy , high - yielding trees can be easily picked and covered for protection in the growing season			1
their farm , @entity184 , is no longer little with 85 acres planted with cherries			2
the family has grown fruit there for more than 50 years			2
@entity22 ’s grandfather @entity189 took on the farm , and her father @entity191 followed him			0
@entity22 , 46 , went into insurance when she left school , but came back to the farm at the age of 23			2
she runs it with her brother @entity197 and farm manager @entity197			0
they work with eight other farms in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity201 , growing fruit for supermarkets			1
an old barn is now a packing plant			0
they employ some locals , but most of the 60 pickers and packers are students from @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214			0
the conditions in which they live and work , their pay and hours are bound by ethical audits			0
many return season after season			0
the new @entity14 cherry is very different to the fruit you used to see being sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities			1
during a short season in july , you could pick up a brown paper bag of small , firm , bright red cherries weighed out by the pound			2
they were a real treat			0
when i was a little girl , my friends and i would hang pairs of cherries from our ears as pretend earrings			2
it was the @entity244 and our mothers would never have allowed us to get our ears pierced , so the seasonal summer cherry served as a delightful — and edible — substitute			2
the fruit we loved then are now heritage varieties , which originated from the wild @entity251 or @entity251 tree , which grew up to 75 ft high ( you can only imagine the health and safety issues involved in picking them )			2
varieties derived from these ancient trees include the romantically named @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260			0
today , few of these are in commercial production , but some survive in old kitchen gardens and ancient orchards			0
the new @entity14 cherry is different to the fruit once sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities unusual among these are the white @entity275 , one of the earliest cherries of the traditional season , or the gorgeous , orangey red , golden fleshed @entity280			1
sour cherries still grow in old orchards — black varieties such as @entity284 or the @entity10 red			0
merchant is an early heritage variety still grown in @entity10 , grafted onto the super-efficient @entity289 stock			0
but most of the big sellers are modern fruits , with @entity293 being the favourite			0
big , deep ruby red and full of sweet juice , it tastes amazing			0
my only criticism is that it is too large to fit in my old - fashioned cherry stoning gadget			1
so these magnificent fruit have to be pitted by hand before i can make jam and puddings			0
all this abundance shows @entity14 cherries have fought back to become a prominent crop			1
‘ as the trees mature they will yield more and more , ’ says @entity22			0
she chooses a cherry from one of the baskets on the ground and eats it			0
‘ i think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are			0
i just love to come to work every day , ’ she says .			0
