by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 9 december 2013 homeowners could be bribed with compensation to accept unpopular new developments which devalue their properties			2
planning minister @entity5 said pay - outs could ‘ help people overcome their objections ’ to projects such as nuclear power stations , rail links or industrial plants			1
he told @entity13 yesterday the proposal was a ‘ radical departure ’ from @entity19 ’s current planning rules , but would help speed up major infrastructure that will boost growth			1
planning minister @entity5 has proposed compensating homeowners into accepting unpopular new developments which devalue their properties ( file picture ) mr @entity5 , well - known for his clashes with countryside campaigners over homebuilding , is likely to provoke controversy and accusations he is railroading people into accepting unpopular construction			1
but he told mps on the @entity31 communities and local government committee he was determined there should be ‘ individual benefits ’ for local residents from new development			0
it would help speed up planning applications and cut down on legal bills , he said			2
there are already schemes to compensate homeowners for roads and rail links which affect the property by creating noise and traffic			0
however , mr @entity5 is proposing direct compensation for lost property value , and to extend this to other types of development			1
he is looking for a place to carry out a pilot scheme in the coming months			0
he said : ‘ i think that everybody recognises that countries have to do difficult things – build roads , build railway lines , build nuclear power stations and other kinds of power sources			0
planning minister @entity5 is looking for a place to carry out a pilot scheme in the coming months ' it is better for everyone that the amount of money is banged up in the transaction process – making the decision , let alone building the thing , as little as possible and relatively speedy			1
with certain projects there has been a principle established of some kind of a benefit being paid to very local communities			0
’ he added : ‘ one of the things we are keen to pilot is whether people who have properties very close to a substantial development might benefit from some form of compensation for the loss of property value , something that does happen in some other countries , the @entity92 have innovated with it			2
‘ it ’s quite a radical departure for this country – it ’s not totally clear how you graft it on to our planning system so that ’s why we ’re going relatively carefully into it and looking to set up a pilot to see whether it can help people overcome their objections to developments that are of benefit to the local community but might have a negative impact on them personally			1
’ the schemes are aimed at ‘ improving our energy security or improving our transport links or improving our national competitiveness ’			0
under the @entity92 system , a small number of people living close to proposed developments who can prove they have suffered ‘ detriment ’ receive compensation payments with an average payout of around £ 8,000			0
a report last year from @entity122 , recommending such a scheme in the @entity19 , estimated it would cost £ 80million a year but the costs would be far outstripped by infrastructure benefits			1
it said : ‘ in @entity19 , at present , residents miles away from a development think they have everything to gain and nothing to lose by objecting to new roads , rail lines , housing or business development			2
’ the @entity135 is consulting on how to compensate people affected by the high speed 2 rail line through buying their home or giving them a property bond			0
a source said of mr @entity5 ’ idea : ‘ it sounds like this proposal is going quite a bit further			1
’ his plan emerged as the @entity145 looks at schemes to give individual homeowners cash or money off their energy bills to accept nearby wind farms .			0
