as nasty as the polar vortex was , it made for some spectacular sights			2
one of the best was the hundreds of beach ball - sized ice boulders that washed up on the shores of @entity6			1
the incredible winter phenomenon , which was captured by many @entity9 videos , takes place when the water temperature falls to just below freezing			0
the motion of the waves then smooth and round the edges of the ice , molding it into spheres similar to how stones are shaped , @entity14 added to @entity29			1
@entity31 meteorologist @entity30 added : ' it 's possible that the ice is accreting like a snowball or like a hailstone , and that they keep growing			1
' ice formations : according to park ranger @entity14 , the balls , weighing up to 75 pounds , form when chunks of ice break off the large sheets of ice on the lake the wind pushes the boulders to the shore and they do n't sink because solid ice is less dense than liquid water			1
the result somewhat resembles a giant bowl of @entity50 along the @entity51 and has drawn the attention of photographers and tourists alike			0
and while the process does require extremely chilly conditions , it 's definitely not the first time such ice balls have appeared , @entity30 said			1
s @entity61 photographer @entity60 knows this well			0
he told mlive.com that he was seen the boulders appear periodically for years , and loves to brave the wintry weather to capture them			1
this year was no different			0
he pulled on his warmest wear and hiked a half - mile from the road to where he had a good view			0
unsurprisingly , he had the whole shore to himself following the storms brought on by the polar vortex			0
' that 's when some of the best shows are , ' he said			0
in warmer weather : while the ice balls are not uncommon in specific weather , @entity6 generally looks like this a @entity83 helicopter flies along the @entity84 in @entity85 , which is full of ice floes , on thursday go with the floe : a ferry makes its way through the ice on the @entity84 the recent cold spell was caused by a polar vortex descending from the @entity93 @entity94 has finally begun to warm up after being in the icy grip of the polar vortex			1
but the chilling news does n't stop , because it 's estimated that the extreme cold weather has cost the @entity94 economy about $ 5billion			1
it brought about the biggest economic disruption delivered by the weather since @entity102 in 2012 , said @entity103 , senior vice president at @entity104 , a business weather intelligence company in suburban @entity105			2
while the impact came nowhere close to @entity102 , which caused an estimated $ 65 billion in property damage alone , the deep freeze 's impact came from its breadth			2
a barge makes its way up the icy @entity114 on the @entity116 riverfront on wednesday barging through : a boat makes its way up the icy @entity114 past @entity116 ' @entity119 the barges on the @entity114 have to muscle their way through the ice ' there 's a lot of economic activity that did n't happen , ' @entity103 said			2
' some of that will be made up but some of it just gets lost			0
' still , @entity129 noted his $ 5 billion estimate pales in comparison with an annual gross domestic product of about $ 15 trillion - working out to maybe one - seventh to one - eighth of one day 's production for the entire country			2
' it 's a small fraction of a percent , but it 's still an impact , ' @entity103 said			0
according to the weather database , @entity94 is experiencing far fewer extreme cold spells than it used to			1
an @entity141 analysis of daily national winter temperature - averaged into one figure for the lower 48 states - shows that since 1900 cold extremes like this week 's happen about once every four years			2
government meteorologist @entity146 created a database of the winter daily national temperature average going back to 1900			0
and monday was the first time since 1979 that the national average temperature dropped below 18 degrees			0
in 27 distinct cold snaps over 115 years , that 's by far the longest the @entity94 has gone without getting this frigid .			1

experts say the extreme cold weather has cost the @entity94 economy $ *5bn*
