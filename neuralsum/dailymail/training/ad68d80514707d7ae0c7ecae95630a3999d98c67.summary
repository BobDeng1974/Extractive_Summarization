it has encountered little difficulty attracting stars from the world of showbusiness			2
but those required for hygiene and safety are proving harder to gain for the @entity8			2
the exclusive @entity10 restaurant has been given only two out of five stars by food health inspectors , meaning an improvement in the kitchen ’s cleanliness is necessary			1
officers discovered several areas were not clean , food had not been cooked to its own recommended safe levels and large amounts of the kitchen had no soap for staff to wash their hands			1
@entity26 and wife @entity27 visited @entity28 on one of their ' date nights ' in june this year			1
the restaurant has now been criticised in a local council health and safety report the restaurant , in @entity35 , central @entity10 , has become the place to be seen for @entity10 's elite prime minister @entity26 took his wife @entity27 there last month for one of their ‘ date - nights ’ and he is not the only one			1
@entity43 , former @entity45 president @entity44 , prince @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 have all dined at the popular nightspot in recent weeks but they may not have been keen to try its signature dish of crab - stuffed doughnuts had they read the report compiled by inspectors last month			2
it reveals the service fridge , fryer , freezer , and floor in the area which stores the kitchen ’s dry food were all deemed ‘ dirty ’			0
broken glass was found on the shelves of the freezer and the fly screen that prevented insects entering where food is prepared was also judged not to be clean			0
there were also gaps in an external store that could have posed a risk of pests entering the kitchen			0
a report reveals staff were unable to effectively wash their hands as there was no soap or hot water in the basins in the kitchen ’s food preparation area , pastry preparation or grill station			1
there was also no hot water available at the sink by the kitchen ’s entrance			0
@entity43 has become a regular at the restaurant since moving to @entity10 and @entity95 is a fan a spokesman for the restaurant said the points highlighted in the report have already been rectified meals involving ‘ high - risk ’ meats , such as beef , lamb and pork , were cooked but recorded at temperatures below safe levels set in its own manuals			1
inspectors criticised the restaurant for not writing down what happened to these dishes – allowing them to tell whether it was thrown away or served to customers			2
the restaurant , which opened earlier this year , is part of a hotel housed in the @entity120 - listed former @entity119 and run by @entity121 , who owns the glamorous @entity122 in @entity123 and the @entity125 hotel in @entity126			0
