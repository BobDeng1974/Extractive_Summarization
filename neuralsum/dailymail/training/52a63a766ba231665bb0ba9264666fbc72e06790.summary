a former head of @entity1 last night warned the revelations by @entity4 fugitive @entity3 had left @entity5 at risk of ‘ vigilantism ’ because it was less able to protect itself from @entity10 fanaticism			1
breaking his silence on the devastating impact of the security breach , @entity11 said : ‘ the result of this can only be that the overall risk of a successful terrorist attack in this country has risen			1
’ in a chilling intervention , he also warned that events in @entity22 and @entity23 had given jihadis a ‘ jolt of energy ’ and the government must complete the ‘ unfinished business ’ of giving the security services extra surveillance powers – or risk ‘ vigilantism ’ on the streets as citizens look to protect themselves			1
former @entity1 spy chief @entity11 , pictured , warned that a lack of security will lead to vigilantism lord @entity11 said : ‘ inadequate security will breed vulnerability and fear and that in turn will tend to limit people ’s ability to contribute to civil society , will tend to provoke vigilantism and will tend to diminish people ’s ability to exercise the very civil liberties and human rights that we wish to sustain			1
’ the ex-spy chief ’s comments came amid a warning from the @entity53 ’s security chief that @entity54 faces its ‘ most serious ’ threat since 9/11			2
@entity56 , the head of @entity57 , revealed there were between 3,000 and 5,000 @entity53 nationals who posed a terrorist threat after travelling overseas to countries such as @entity22			2
he told @entity62 : ‘ clearly , we ’re dealing with a large body of mainly young men who have the potential to come back and have the potential or the intent and capability to carry out attacks we have seen in @entity72			2
’ lord @entity11 , who stood down as head of @entity1 in april 2013 , used his maiden speech in the @entity75 last night to deliver a devastating analysis of the harm caused by @entity3 , who stole and leaked thousands of documents detailing intelligence - gathering techniques used by @entity81 intelligence agencies			1
the revelations , printed in @entity83 , have led to terrorists changing the way they communicate			2
they have also made internet companies less willing to co-operate with @entity1 and @entity88 for fear of upsetting privacy campaigners			1
lord @entity11 , who sits as an independent crossbench peer , said : ‘ when i left @entity1 in 2013 , i felt cautiously optimistic that we were over the worst as far as @entity93 and @entity10 terrorist attacks were concerned			1
‘ it seemed to me that we were making significant progress			0
regrettably , subsequent events have proved that judgment to be wrong			0
‘ the atrocious killing of @entity100 in may 2013 demonstrated the reality of the threat we face in this country and the brutal murders in @entity72 last week demonstrate that this is a @entity54 and international problem , not one we face alone			0
lord @entity11 said @entity3 's revelations allowed terrorists to avoid detection by the security services ‘ the revelations made by @entity3			1
have clearly led a reduction in the ability of the security agencies both here and overseas to access and read the communications of terrorists internationally , with the result that as the threat from terrorism has gone up in the last two years , the ability of the security agencies to counter those threats has gone down			2
’ lord @entity11 also warned the current situation of extremists returning to the @entity5 from @entity22 – 600 have travelled out , according to @entity1 – put him in mind of the @entity93 training camps in @entity129 before 9/11			1
he said : ‘ on their return , many of them were even more radical than they had been when they departed			0
‘ they had experience of combat and had been trained in violence and they had an international network of support on which they could draw			0
those circumstances led to a series of attacks internationally and over a long period , and i fear we may be facing the same situation			0
’ mr @entity56 said the terror threat was the ‘ most serious ’ the continent had faced since the fall of the @entity148 more than 13 years ago			0
he told the @entity149 that @entity57 had been building a database of @entity53 citizens who had travelled overseas to fight			0
so far it has collected 2,500 names of suspects from security agencies across member states – but he believes as many as 5,000 may have gone abroad			0
it came amid a continued row at the top of @entity160 over surveillance powers			1
on monday , prime minister @entity162 said a future @entity164 government would pass laws which aim to deny terrorists a ‘ safe space ’ to communicate online			0
yesterday , deputy prime minister @entity168 reiterated his party ’s opposition to a ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ , saying @entity5 will not be kept safer by keeping records on grandmothers visiting ‘ garden centre websites ’ .			0
