more than 6,000 pubs have shut over the past eight years thanks to sky - high taxes and government red tape			1
the smoking ban , increases in alcohol duty and declining real wages since the recession have directly contributed to more than half of all closures since 2006			1
the @entity12 said that taxes on drink in the @entity15 are so high that @entity15 drinkers pay 40 per cent of the amount raised in alcohol duty raised across the whole of the @entity20			1
a think tank has warned that more than 6,000 pubs have shut over the past eight years , including this boarded up establishment in central @entity24 , due to high taxes and the smoking ban the think tank called for an end to the thrust of recent government policy which it said had actively discouraged people from visiting their local			1
as part of a radical package of measures to save the @entity15 pub , it demanded the watering down of the smoking ban allow people to smoke in special rooms			1
report author , @entity42 , said : ' @entity15 pubs may be suffering from long - term cultural shifts , but government policies have hugely exacerbated this trend			2
' taxation and regulation have been the leading causes of the decimation of the @entity15 pub industry since 2006			0
' the level of alcohol duty in the @entity15 is hugely regressive , hitting the poorest the hardest			1
' taxes must be lowered , and one - size - fits - all policies like the current smoking ban must be reconsidered if we are to temper the rate of decline of the @entity15 pub. ' the report said that although the last forty years have been characterised by a drastic decline in the pub industry , the rate of closures has accelerated over the past decade thanks to the smoking ban and tax hikes since 2006 the number of pubs has plummeted from just over 58,000 to 48,000 , a drop of nearly 20 per cent			1
in his report , @entity73 – who 's killing the @entity15 pub ? , mr @entity42 found that changing social trends - such as changing tastes and the shift towards home drinking – did not alone explain the rapid acceleration of pub closures in recent years			0
instead , policies such as the smoking ban and alcohol duty escalator are responsible for speeding up the rate of closures in the past decade compared to the last forty years of steady decline in the pub industry			1
' in 2008 the government raised alcohol duty by six per cent in real terms and introduced a duty escalator that automatically increased alcohol taxes by two per cent above inflation every year thereafter , ' he said			1
' in 2011 , @entity93 rose to 20 per cent			0
combined with falling real wages during the recession , drinking has become much less affordable			2
the escalator was finally abandoned this year , yet taxes remain high			0
' traditional pubs ( like the one pictured ) are under threat unless the government water down the smoking ban to allow people to smoke in special rooms he argued there was no need to bow to calls for government intervention in the form of taxpayers ' money to boost failing pubs			2
instead , to end the downward spiral of the industry , mr @entity115 claimed ministers must lower alcohol duty and @entity93 , as well as reconsidering one - size - fits - all policies such as the smoking ban			1
the report said some cultural changes were also damaging the @entity15 pub , with a 16 per cent fall in beer purchases in supermarkets and off - licenses since 2003 , but a ' colossal ' 54 per cent fall in beer purchases in pubs			2
it means pubs are selling half as much beer as they did eleven years ago - largely thanks to a move towards cheap drinks in supermarkets			0
economic changes have also led to better domestic living conditions , a shrinking of the working class and decline of heavy industry , which explain some changes to the health of the pub industry			0
the post- 2006 decline , however , is exceptional and gradual cultural change can not explain it			0
much of the blame , however , is lain squarely at the door of the government			0
the report said : ' the past seven years have been characterised by a flurry of policies which have severely damaged the pub industry			0
the smoking ban , introduced in 2007 , has also had a big impact			2
' although only 20 per cent of @entity159 smoke regularly , smokers have always been disproportionately more likely to drink and visit pubs , ' the report said			0
' following the introduction of the smoking ban , the amount of pub customers who smoked fell from 54 per cent to under 40 per cent in just two years			2
' the @entity12 called on ministers to halve alcohol duty - pointing out that @entity15 drinkers pay 40 per cent of the @entity20 's entire alcohol duty bill			1
halving the duty would bring it into line with the @entity173 average , which would reduce both the cost of living and alcohol fraud			0
the think tank added that vat should be lowered from 20 per cent to 15 per cent , with a lower rate of vat for food sold in pubs and restaurants , as happens in many @entity173 countries calling the smoking ban ' one of the most uncompromising ' in the world , the @entity12 said there is clearly a market for venues that allow smoking in one or more ventilated rooms			1
the think tank also said planning rules which currently prohibit new pubs from opening in areas of high demand should be scrapped .			0

since 2006 number of pubs has fallen by 20 per cent from 58,000 to 48,000
last decade is most drastic drop compared to last forty years of decline
smoking ban , alcohol duty increases and decline in real wages to blame
a think tank is calling on the government to help save the @entity15 boozer
demands watering down of smoking ban and cuts in taxes on alcohol
