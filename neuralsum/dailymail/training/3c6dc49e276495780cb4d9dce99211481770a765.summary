if you 're one of those people who wake up in the middle of the night and reach for the phone then you 're not alone			0
a recent survey from the @entity5 has found that rather than being a place of rest and intimacy , the bedroom is becoming more like an office due to the amount of electronics in it			1
out of the of 1,500 people studied , a whopping 45 per cent regularly take a laptop , electronic device or watch tv in bed , hindering their chances of some quality shut - eye			1
the foundation 's sleep psychologist professor @entity23 says : ' a standard guideline for good sleep is that the bed should be reserved for sleep and intimacy only			1
' so it was alarming to learn that so many people were using their sleep sanctuary to email , cruise the web and watch movies , all activities that are not conducive to sleep			1
' animals are a big no and should be banned from the bed and bedroom if they are noisy says professor @entity23 professor @entity23 says that @entity57 are not taking their sleep seriously enough which is worrying as being over-wrought and sleep deprived can cause illnesses and hazards			1
as well as the obvious risks with operating machinery and driving , those with regular fragmented sleep are more at risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes			2
lack of sleep has also been linked to depression and weight problems like obesity			1
' solutions exist for many of these disturbances but this data reflects a widespread failure to prioritise sleep , ' adds professor @entity23			2
professor @entity23 says try to avoid using your phone or computer within one hour of bedtime as the blue screen will suppress the hormone that makes us sleepy			0
she also says to cut back on coffee interestingly , 70 per cent of those studied said they ' often look at the clock ' when they wake up during the night but it 's not clear whether it 's a quick glance or clock watching			1
the latter leaves those with fragmented sleep agitated and frustrated , which in turn causes more disturbance and those struggling to drop off are advised to to cover the clock			2
' a quiet and comfortable bedroom environment is an obvious prerequisite for maximising sleep quality , adds professor @entity23			2
more than 70 per cent of those studied said they ' often look at the clock ' when they wake up during the night ' great sleep relies on a quiet room , a relaxed mind and a comfortable bed			1
' but you 'd be surprised how many people ignore these important guidelines and snuggle up with their iphone in their overheated bedroom after drinking too many glasses of wine			0
' the survey showed that 22 per cent believe they drink too much alcohol , a quarter admitted drinking coffee after 2pm and more than a third confessed to not winding down before hopping into bed			1
make it stop : lack of sleep can cause arguments , frustration , anxiety and magnify whatever bad is happening ' lots of people believe coffee does n't affect their sleep but research proves it actually makes deep sleep lighter up to 14 hours after it 's consumed , ' adds professor @entity23			1
it might seem like that tipple is making you relaxed but it will actually make the second half of your night 's sleep more fragmented			1
' four in ten blamed a snoring partner for their lack of sleep while others said they were kept awake or aggravated by noisy pets , the temperature and uncomfortable clothing and bedding			1
have a regular sleep pattern			2
try to go to bed at the same time every evening and get up at the same time every morning			2
this will help your body to work out a healthy sleep routine			2
spend the right amount of time in bed			2
most adults need about 8 hours sleep every night			2
some require more and some less			0
many poor sleepers spend much more than 8 hours in bed and this makes fragmented sleep a habit			1
except if you have lengthy sleep requirements , limit your time in bed to no more than 8.5 hours			1
if you often take hours to fall asleep , go to bed later			0
remember that children need more sleep than adults			0
bed is for sleeping , not entertainment			0
ditch the @entity177 , mobile phones , laptops and other electronic devices			0
your mind needs to be in the habit of knowing that if you are in bed , you are there to sleep			1
do n't stay in bed if you are wide awake			0
wind down and relax before going to bed			0
have a buffer zone before bedtime			0
sort out any problems before going to bed or allocate a ' worry time ' during the day to go over the day 's activities and work out a plan of action for the next day			1
try to avoid using your computer within one hour of bedtime as the blue screen will suppress the hormone that makes us sleepy			0
do n't exercise too late in the evening			0
find a relaxation technique that works for you			0
make sure your bedroom is comfortable			0
you should have a quiet , dark room with comfortable bedding and good temperature control			0
