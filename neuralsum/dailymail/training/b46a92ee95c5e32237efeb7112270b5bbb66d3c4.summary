by @entity1 reporter @entity3 should openly threaten @entity4 with legal action over its treatment of @entity7 and set out a ‘ more robust ’ response to incursions into @entity3 waters , @entity2 said as they warned ministers it was time to ‘ get off the fence ’ in the diplomatic spat			1
an influential commons committee said the @entity16 had been too timid in responding to what it said was @entity20 ’s deliberate and politically - motivated use of border delays as a means of ‘ coercion ’ , ‘ cavalier ’ raids by vessels and ramped up rhetoric			1
a cautious policy of trying to de-escalate tensions with a key ally was understandable but had so far had ‘ little discernible effect ’ beyond frustrating residents of the @entity3 overseas territory over the lack of firm action , the cross-party foreign affairs committee said			0
the @entity53 has been a long - running cause of friction , with @entity4 maintaining a long - standing challenge to @entity3 ’s sovereignty over the territory which it has held since 1713			1
tensions flared again last summer when @entity20 imposed strict border controls in retaliation for the creation of what @entity7 says is a concrete ‘ reef ’ but @entity4 insists was a deliberate move to block its fishing fleet			2
there have been severe delays at the crossing between @entity4 and @entity7 and more than 600 cases of @entity4 government vessels unlawfully entering @entity3 territorial waters around @entity7 since the start of 2013			1
‘ the behaviour of @entity4 toward @entity7 is unacceptable , ’ the @entity2 said			1
‘ a @entity77 and @entity50 ally is , as a matter of policy , deliberately impacting the economy of a @entity81			0
‘ it is time for the government to get off the fence and take a tougher line			0
tough lines : the group of mps in the committee said the behaviour of @entity4 toward @entity7 is ' unacceptable ' ‘ we have no doubt that delays imposed by @entity4 at the border with @entity7 are politically motivated , and that the border is being used as a means of coercion			1
‘ the government is right to look to the @entity98 to address this matter , but it should state publicly that it will take legal action against @entity4 in the @entity47 if there is little improvement in the next six months			0
’ @entity103 of the @entity104 allows an @entity50 member state to pursue through the @entity47 another which it believes has ‘ failed to fulfil an obligation under the @entity109 ’			0
ministers should also set out which ‘ naval and police options it has identified and ... intends to pursue ’ to defend the waters off @entity53			0
@entity116 words : sir @entity117 said @entity4 is ' deliberately impacting the economy of a @entity81 ' the @entity4 ambassador has been summoned to the @entity16 four times since the current government in @entity20 took office in december 2011 to hear protests about incursions and @entity125 has sent inspectors to the crossing			2
but the @entity2 said diplomatic protests were only being made weeks after the event ‘ robbing them of all force ’ and giving the impression officials were simply ‘ going through the motions ’			0
the ambassador should be hauled in more frequently , all incidents responded to in no more than seven days and @entity98 officials despatched to the crossing again at the shortest possible notice to both sides , the report recommended			0
pressure should also be exerted on @entity4 - which is guilty of hypocrisy at best over its own claims on overseas territories - by threatening to drop @entity3 support for its ambitions such as gaining a place on the @entity149 @entity148 , the committee said			1
the government was also criticised for doing little to tackle an ‘ unacceptable ’ ban on cross-border military movements even by @entity77 allies , saying it was ‘ not appropriate for the @entity3 to simply work around it ’			0
there was ‘ merit ’ in the idea of @entity7 seeking to remove border controls with @entity4 by joining the @entity50 ’s @entity158 , they said , though there could be ‘ considerable legal and economic implications ’ as in @entity125 terms it is part of the @entity3 , which is not a member			1
@entity166 chair sir @entity117 said : ‘ the behaviour of @entity4 toward @entity7 is unacceptable			2
‘ we have a situation where a @entity77 and @entity50 ally is deliberately impacting the economy of a @entity81			0
‘ but with the @entity16 taking far too long to register diplomatic protests , we are giving entirely the wrong impression to @entity4 about how seriously the @entity3 takes these issues			1
’ the report was published as @entity177 minister @entity176 made a visit to @entity7 but the @entity2 said that in the light of what the @entity7 had gone through over the past year there should be ‘ a high - level visit ’ within the next few months .			2

@entity2 warn @entity16 it **'s** time to ' get of the fence ' about @entity7
commons committee say responses to @entity4 have been ' too timid '
@entity4 has long tried to challenge @entity3 **'s** sovereignty in @entity7
