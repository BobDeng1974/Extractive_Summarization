in the battle of the heartwarming @entity3 adverts , one airline has gone all out to deliver festive cheer			2
@entity6 airline @entity5 delivered its own @entity3 miracle by sending @entity8 to the @entity9 and spread some joy in the @entity11			1
@entity5 employees and volunteers headed to a small community and placed a surprise sleigh placed in the middle of town			1
@entity5 surprised residents of @entity19 , @entity9 with a gigantic sleigh in the town centre during the day , community members all had a chance to communicate to @entity8 via the sleigh ’s video screen and tell him what they wanted for @entity3 this year			1
requests were as diverse as a new engine for a man ’s motorbike taxi business to a skateboard to a horse			0
the next morning , the volunteers headed out shopping to gather all of the items on the community ’s list			2
@entity5 then invited everyone down to the beach for a @entity3 party for a surprise - everything that they had asked for in personalised blue waterproof bins			1
except for the horse , which was hand - delivered by @entity8 himself			0
they even brought in snow for the kids to play in , marking the first time that most of the @entity49 community had ever seen it			2
and if those heart - warming acts were n’t enough to get you choked up , @entity5 assured that tears would flow by unveiling one final surprise for the poor coastal residents : a brand new community playground			1
after the community left their holiday gift wishes for @entity8 , they were all called to the beach the following day @entity5 volunteers had gone shopping and collected all of the items on the community 's list ' in this community , they have to drive 20 minutes and actually pay to use a playground , so by introducing a playground , it really does create a safe environment for them to play in , ' @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and experiential marketing manager at @entity5 explained			1
@entity66 also spoke about the company 's decision to take this year 's @entity78 abroad			0

' we ’ve really gotten to know the residents , so over the years of working with them , we ’ve really just identified their core values to be similar to ours			0
' the airline workers surprised the community members on the beach with everything from a new motorbike engine to a washing machine to a horse @entity5 is a low - cost @entity6 carrier , travelling to the @entity93 , the @entity11 and @entity94			1

' this was really the last chapter in the @entity104 trilogy , ' @entity66 added			0

' if our guests feel that it ’s something they ’d like to see again next year , we ’ll certainly put our heads together and see what we can come up with			0
' last year , @entity5 set up a video booth where travellers could tell @entity8 their holiday gift wishes in real - time			1
