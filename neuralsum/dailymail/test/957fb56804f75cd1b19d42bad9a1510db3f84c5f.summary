@entity0 , account director at @entity1 , revealed the underhand tactics used by his company to coax information from people data bosses have been caught boasting to the mail of the underhand tactics they use to trick homeowners into giving away their secrets			1
in meetings with our undercover reporters , they admitted ignoring an official no - call list meant to protect the vulnerable			1
and they said they could never be honest with people about the consequences of passing on personal information because then no one would answer their calls			1
‘ we ’re a business at the end of the day , ’ one told the @entity7			0
‘ if we was [ sic ] to then turn round and say , “ you ’re now going to get 30 calls from this company , that company ” , most of the people will probably say , “ i do n’t want it ”			1
because they know it ’s going to be a sales call			2
’ various firms offered to sell personal information to the @entity7 ’s undercover team using data from lifestyle surveys completed by people who had been cold - called from overseas			1
they claimed that calling offshore meant they could disregard the official @entity42 ( @entity43 ) – even though the @entity44 said this was not true			1
once they get people on the phone , the call centre workers ask them to complete a lifestyle survey			1
they start with ‘ soft ’ questions that seem harmless before going into ones about personal finances			0
while a brief disclaimer is read , bosses admitted victims do not realise answering the questions will lead to dozens of calls from different companies			1
so even if a caller has signed up to the @entity43 , saying yes to a survey question is seen to override this , giving the companies the green light to cold call them again			2
an undercover reporter from the @entity7 met @entity0 , account director at @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , which has a 60 - seater call centre in the @entity76 and calls hundreds of thousands in @entity77 every month			1
mr @entity0 's company has a 60 - seater call centre in the @entity76 and calls hundreds of thousands in @entity77 every month			1
he explained that their tactics include starting with warm questions before going more financial asked if he thought people doing surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result he said ' generally i do n't think some people realise that they 're going to get calls ' for 8p a record , mr @entity0 offered to sell the @entity7 information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago he said : ‘ so at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy , warm questions to open up – what is the age of your tv			1
‘ when you start going more financial – how much you ’re earning , would you like a [ pension ] review – [ they say ] “ no i ’m not interested			0
i do n’t want any sales calls			0
no , i ’m going , bye ”			0
’ mr @entity0 said any answers given before the call ended were taken as confirmation that the caller was happy to be on marketing lists in future			1
‘ i mean , we ’re a business at the end of the day , ’ he said			0
‘ when you try and dig into people ’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information			1
’ so questions about finance were left to later in the call , he explained			2
asked if he thought people doing the surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result , he said : ‘ if i ’m honest , and i ’m always honest , generally i think some people do n’t realise that they ’re going to get calls			1
’ mr @entity0 said his firm try to get round the no - call list by ringing mobiles – which few realise can be on the @entity43 – and by calling from abroad			1
‘ the problem we ’re having now , a lot of it might be on the @entity43 register			0
hence why when we call out offshore , ’ he said			2
‘ certain companies will say to us , “ can you run it against the @entity43 file and tell us what you ’ve got which is @entity146 ? ” ok , fine			0
but the volumes will drop drastically			0
’ asked how the firm gets away with calling people registered with the @entity43 , he said : ‘ because it ’s offshore			2
’ he claimed , wrongly , the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) regulations govern only calls within the @entity77			0
for 8p a record , mr @entity0 offered to sell the @entity7 information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago			1
the @entity1 is run by @entity157 , 38 , and his wife @entity158 , 35 , who claim they are the ‘ good guys ’ in ‘ an industry rife with cowboys ’			1
they started more than a decade ago from a garage in @entity163 before turning it into a firm with a turnover of more than £ 2million			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we strongly refute any allegations which suggest @entity1 is in any way contravening the law or any recognised code of practice			1
respondents to our telephone - based surveys are informed from the outset that our surveys are being carried out for marketing purposes			2
they are not for market research			0
if respondents “ opt - in ” they clearly expect to receive calls and be contacted again			2
’ data firm @entity183 also admitted calling names on the @entity43 register from call centres in the @entity76 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
account manager @entity189 told us : ‘ if you ’re wanting to sponsor a question then no , we would n’t tps it , because we have their name and they asked if they ’re interested in receiving a call back			2
’ @entity183 is owned by @entity199 and @entity200 and is a rebranding of @entity202 , which was suspended by the @entity203 in 2011 for calling people on the @entity43 and selling under the guise of research			2
the @entity1 has strongly refuted allegations suggesting it is contravening the law or any recognised code of practice the firm said it does not own offshore call centres but buys survey data from other firms , including @entity215			1
mr @entity216 said : ‘ @entity183 takes compliance very seriously			0
’ @entity218 , the @entity44 ’s head of enforcement , said : ‘ organisations can not get around the law by pretending to conduct market or lifestyle research			0
market research should be just that – market research without the intention of passing on people ’s details			2
using a foreign call centre does not get you out of your commitments to consumers			2
’ @entity0 said callers start with ' soft ' questions like ' how old is your main tv in you property ' @entity1 ’s @entity0 boasted to a mail undercover reporter of the tactics used by his firm to coax information from people it cold calls			1
‘ when you try and dig into people ’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information			1
‘ like if you was to call me and say , “ what ’s your household income ? ” , i do n’t wish to answer that			1
i do n’t want to tell you what i ’m earning			0
because , i do n’t know , you could be some lucrative crime gang , know where i live , know i earn over £ 50k a year , and you think right , well if he ’s earning more than £ 50k a year , he ’s probably going to have a nice car , he ’s probably going to have some nice valuables in there			0
‘ so we find that when you get to them sort of questions , we leave them to the bottom of the survey			0
so at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy , warm questions to open up – how old is your main tv in your property ? is it less than one year , one to five years or five years plus ? which newspaper do you read ? do you have @entity274 through a satellite dish ? yes ? ok , when ’s your household insurance up for renewal ? what month only			0
‘ when you start going more financial – how much you ’re earning , would you like a [ pension ] review ? – [ they say ] “ no i ’m not interested			0
i do n’t want any sales calls			0
no , i ’m going , bye ”			0
they put the phone down			0
so we ’ve only got the opt in for them answers what they ’ve opted in			0
‘ if i ’m honest , and i ’m always honest , generally i think some people do n’t realise that they ’re going to get calls			1
i mean , we ’re a business at the end of the day			0
if you go , “ you ’re going to get 30 calls on the back of this ” , you ’re going to get a consumer going , “ i do n’t want to tell you any information ”			2
it ’s natural , it ’s human nature			0
‘ if we was to then turn round and say at the end of the survey call , “ right you ’re now going to get 30 calls from this company , that company ” , most of the people will probably say , “ i do n’t want it ”			1
‘ nine times out of ten they ’ll probably say , “ no i do n’t want to be contacted by that company ” because they know it ’s going to be a sales call			0
