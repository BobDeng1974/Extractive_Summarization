by @entity1 - squire transgender @entity2 , who once weighed 47 stones , today thanked taxpayers for funding the £ 28,000 gastric bypass that changed her life			1
losing 29 stones gave @entity10 , 42 – who used to be a man called @entity12 – the confidence become a woman			1
and now the senior schoolteacher is looking forward to a £ 6,000 body lift to remove excess skin as well as a £ 10,000 sex change operation - also all paid for by the taxpayer			1
transgender @entity2 lost 29 stones after a gastric bypass operation on the @entity22 but 6ft 1in @entity10 claims her weight loss surgery – which cost more than double because she was so big her op needed extra medical staff and specialist equipment - is money well spent			1
' i do n't feel guilty , ' she says of her @entity22 bill , which will eventually total almost £ 50,000 , ' at 47 stones i was so big i was confined to bed			1
i had to rely on carers and benefits			1
now i 've saved the taxpayer money because losing weight meant i could go back to work			1
' and @entity10 , from @entity37 , who sports a @entity39 bust from taking female hormones , claims she is also entitled to gender reassignment surgery and a free body lift			1
' being born a woman in a man 's body has been as traumatic as having cancer			1
and the saggy skin left from losing so much weight makes me sore so medically it needs to be removed			1
' meanwhile , she only ate so much because her gender issues – which began when she was aged 11 - were not recognised when she was at school			1
' at primary school i had difficulty making friends , ' says @entity10 who grew up with parents @entity55 , 69 , a retired chemist , mother @entity58 , 68 , a retired financial administrator and sister @entity61 , 32 , ' at the time i did n't realise why but in hindsight i did n't identify with boys and all their talk about cars and football			1
@entity2 , before when she was @entity12 , with her father @entity55 , now aged 69 @entity2 is looking forward to a £ 6,000 body lift to remove excess skin as well as a £ 10,000 sex change operation ' i was always interested in make up and clothes with the girls			1
i cried when i could n't go with the girls for talks about periods			1
it was then i knew i 'd been born into the wrong body			1
' but she was so ashamed of how she felt that she did n't confide in anyone			1
' i knew my parents would be horrified , ' she says , ' and then i 'd never even heard of anyone wanting to change gender			1
' her secret led her to comfort eat			1
' as a child i was slim but from the age of 13 i ate huge portions			1
as well as a cooked breakfast and school dinner , i would buy chips to eat on the way home from school			2
then after a home cooked tea i 'd sneak downstairs and make myself bacon butties			2
' the weight soon piled on			2
' aged 13 i weighed 13 stones and from then on i put on at least a stone a year			1
' @entity10 says she is grateful to the @entity22 for her new life			1
' i know i 've been lucky to have had tens of thousands of pounds of treatment spent on me but i 'm proof it is money well spent ' aged 15 and 15st , @entity10 's mother took her to see her gp			2
' i was referred to a dietician who told me to cut back on my portion sizes			2
but no - one addressed the real problem of why i was eating – because i was so unhappy being in a man 's body			1
' by the age of 18 , @entity10 was so depressed she was on antidepressants			2
meanwhile , after leaving school , she had trained to become an electrician			2
but her weight soared so much she became too heavy to climb a ladder or squeeze into tiny spaces and had to give up work			2
@entity10 decided to become a teacher , going to university to do a teaching degree			2
however , her weight continued to soar			2
' by the age of 24 i weighed around 26 stones			1
i 'd start the day with a big fried breakfast , followed by chips , sausage rolls , fish and chips in curry sauce , eight bottles of lager , and then more take aways			2
i just ate all the time			2
' during her twenties she married twice – but both the marriages only lasted a couple of years			2
' the first marriage was when i was 22 and met @entity138 as a pen pal			2
but aged 24 we 'd split up			2
second time around i married another woman but again divorced after just two years			2
' looking back i just married because i longed to be normal			2
i thought getting married would make me happy but instead it made me realise how unhappy i was			2
' after her divorces , @entity10 moved to be near with her parents who were living in the @entity145			0
however , by the age of 30 , she weighed 47 stones and was unable to work or care for herself			1
' although i had my own cottage , i was forced to claim benefits because i was too fat to work			0
i could n't even get out of bed or wash myself properly			0
instead , i laid in bed all day , occasionally venturing out on a disabled scooter			0
' a home help came in to wash and clean twice a day			0
meanwhile mum would bring in food			0
i 'd beg for takeaways			0
if she refused to get them then i 'd order them in instead			0
as well as meals of sandwiches , and packets of crisps , i adored pizza or @entity166 food			0
i just ate all day			0
' it was during this time that @entity10 , who was still on antidepressants , went for a counselling session one day and as her usual doctor was away , saw another			0
@entity10 claims her weight loss surgery - which cost more than double because she was so big her op needed extra medical staff and specialist equipment - is money well spent ' it was speaking with him i realised that the reason why i was so fat and wasting my life was because i was so unhappy i was a man			1
' @entity10 was referred to the gender clinic at @entity183 and after consultations , @entity10 was diagnosed with gender dysmorphia			0
however , before she could take hormones or have a sex change operation , she would have to lose weight			1
' my doctor had recently said if i did n't stop eating i would only have a year to live			0
with no exercise i was a heart attack waiting to happen and i was heading for diabetes			0
as i had so much weight to lose it was decided the best option would be a gastric bypass			1
' @entity10 had to lose four stones first – which she did by drinking slimming shakes and just eating one meal a day			0
' i was so desperate to start my sex change treatment that for the first time in my life i felt i really had a future to look forward to and wanted to lose weight			1
however it took me six months to lose that four stones and by the end my weight was starting to edge up again			0
so i knew i 'd never be able to lose so much weight just by dieting			0
' before her operation : @entity10 , from @entity37 , with her father @entity55 , now aged 69 ' i do n't feel guilty , ' @entity10 says of her @entity22 bill , which will eventually total almost £ 50,000 aged 37 she was booked in for the gastric bypass - which works by removing some of the digestive system so food is n't so easily absorbed - at @entity219 hospital in @entity220			1
she says : ' the doctor said due to my weight it was 50/50 whether or not i 'd survive the operation			1
a week before i confessed to my parents i was doing it because i wanted to change sex			0
' both mum and dad were horrified , especially my mum			0
they had no idea i was having the gastric bypass so i could become a woman			1
@entity234 did n't speak with me for months because she was so shocked and upset			0
she kept saying perhaps i was just gay or going through a phase			0
she could n't understand it			0
' fortunately the four hour operation went well			1
' for the first six months i could only eat shakes and sugar free ice lollies but i lost nine stones			0
' and within ten months i 'd lost 12 stones and begun to eat mashed food			0
' @entity10 decided to move to @entity244 , where she would be close to @entity183 hospital for her gender reassignment treatment			0
win weeks she landed a teaching job and started hormones			0
' i was thrilled with the results - a waist and hips plus a @entity39 bust			1
i 've since had laser treatment to remove facial stubble , grown my hair long and bought new feminine clothes			0
' she now weighs 18 stones and is on the waiting list for a full gender reassignment operation , which involves making a vagina from the penis			1
' luckily my mum has now come round			0
for my birthday recently she even sent me a daughter birthday card			0
she realises now although i 've changed sex i am still the same person			1
' because @entity10 has so much flabby skin , she qualifies for medical reasons for a total body lift			0
' right now i get lots of infections in between the flaps of skin which are really painful			0
i ca n't wait to have it all removed			0
' i hope to lose a little more weight , probably going down from a size 18 to 20 dress size to a size 16 , and then after my skin removal op , i will be having my sex change			0
' as she is a supply teacher she moves from school to school			0
she says : ' luckily i 've never had that awkward moment when i 've left one term as sir and returned the next as @entity288 ' and people rarely seem to guess i even used to be a man			1
' she still hopes to find love – with a woman			0
' there is someone i speak to regularly , ' she says , ' we met online and she lives abroad			0
so it 's early days yet in our relationship but i would adore to settle down with a woman			0
' meanwhile , she is grateful to the @entity22 for her new life			1
' i know i 've been lucky to have had tens of thousands of pounds of treatment spent on me but i 'm proof it is money well spent			0
