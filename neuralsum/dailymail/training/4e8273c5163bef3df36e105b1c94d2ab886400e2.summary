by @entity0 last updated at 5:43 pm on 11th january 2012 a mother has told how her daughter was left unconscious after a hospital issued medicine that was incorrectly labelled			1
three - year - old @entity5 was diagnosed with epilepsy last march , a condition which affects the brain and causes seizures			1
the youngster was prescribed buccal midazolam , a muscle relaxant which is rubbed into the gums and used to treat prolonged attacks lasting five minutes or more			2
@entity5 pictured with mother @entity15 and the mislabelled medicine bottle which caused her to take 20 times more than the correct dose of medicine however her mother @entity15 , 29 , claims the bottle she was given at @entity21 , in @entity22 , @entity23 , recommended 2.5ml doses instead of 0.25ml			1
and on one occasion she was told to double the measure because it had taken so long for @entity5 to recover from a seizure - meaning she gave her daughter a dose 20 times higher than the recommended amount			1
as a result , @entity5 lost consciousness and her family feared the worst			1
mrs @entity5 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ' her lips went blue and we thought we had lost her			1
' she deteriorated drastically and stopped breathing and went blue			2
she vomited and was choking			2
she was in hospital for the whole night			0
the doctors did n't notice that she had been given too much			0
it was me that noticed			0
' i 'm angry and annoyed			0
' @entity46 guidelines suggest that children aged six months to 12 months , should be given a 0.25ml dose of buccal midazolam , while those aged one to four should be prescribed 0.5ml			1
as a precaution , each time mrs @entity5 uses the medication with her daughter she returns to hospital for a check - up			1
but she claims that during visits medics never questioned the dose she was administering and it was only when her daughter lost consciousness that it was clear something was wrong			1
she added : ' when i looked at it i thought ' that 's a lot ' but i thought the doctor was right			0
i have not been to medical school			0
' since the incident mrs @entity5 who is married to @entity66 , 24 , and has a son @entity67 , seven months , has issued a complaint			2
@entity69 confirmed they are investigating the case and have apologised to the family			0
a spokesperson said : ' we are very sorry for any distress and anxiety that @entity5 's family have experienced			2
' we take every complaint we receive very seriously and are currently carrying out our own investigation into this case which is ongoing and , as such , it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage			0
' according to the electronic @entity84 ( @entity83 ) database , midazolam overdoses should not present a threat to life unless the patient has pre-existing respiratory or cardiac problems and it is combined with other central nervous system depressants			0
the @entity91 said as it is a fairly new medication , it is regularly being monitored .			0
