the taxman is already under fire over proposed powers to plunder unpaid income tax direct from people ’s bank accounts but it emerged last night that under controversial new powers @entity7 will also be allowed to snatch money from low - paid families in receipt of tax credits			1
even struggling families who are only held to owe the government money because of mistakes by @entity7 will still face having the cash snatched straight from their banks			0
tax credits are payments made to people on such low incomes they are deemed to need financial help with family costs and on @entity7 ’s own figures the proposed new powers will be used against 3,000 people a year who have received too much in tax credits , which are designed to help low - paid families with children			1
news of the @entity7 ’s plans to use new powers against the poor come on top of mounting outrage from bankers , accountants , small businesses and civil liberties charity @entity39 , over the proposal that the taxman should be able to snatch unpaid income tax direct from citizen ’s bank accounts			2
but it has now become clear that the same new power - known as ‘ @entity48 ’ , and set to be granted to the @entity49 if a proposal by chancellor @entity51 goes ahead – will also be used against people paid tax credits			1
tax credits are payments made to people on such low incomes they are deemed to need financial help with family costs			1
but recipients have to estimate in advance how much they will be paid , before their tax credits are calculated accordingly			2
if people then receive pay rises , or other additional income , and do not tell @entity7 straight away , they are then deemed to have been overpaid , and then have to give some of the money back			0
as they are by definition already on low pay , getting the money together to pay it back can be difficult			0
but under the new @entity66 proposals , the @entity7 will have the power to seize the money straight from the accounts of the people involved , a spokesman for the tax collectors last night admitted that it estimated 3,000 tax credit recipients a year would be hit , but insisted it would only take money if it could leave a minimum of £ 5,000 in the account involved			1
a spokesman for @entity7 ( head office above ) admitted that it estimated 3,000 tax credit recipients a year would be hit , but insisted it would only take money if it could leave a minimum of £ 5,000 in the account involved but campaigning group @entity81 , which discovered the plans to hit the accounts of the low - paid only thanks to a @entity85 request , yesterday said it feared the new powers would end up costing dear ever - growing numbers of people			1
according to the @entity7 ’s own figures the total owed back to the government in overpaid tax credits stands at more than £ 5.6bn			1
around 10 per cent of the families involved have a household income of less than £ 20,000 a year , and 118,000 of those being chased over debts – which could have been caused by the taxman ’s own errors – earn less than £ 5,000 a year			1
@entity81 spokeswoman @entity99 said : ‘ these figures show that tax credit overpayments are just a state - created debt that many families can never pay off , caused by a combination of low pay , costly childcare , and government incompetence and sleight of hand			2
‘ a personal debt burden of £ 5.6bn – more than £ 1bn of it dating back more than five years – has turned a system that was supposed to support parents into what is effectively a “ parent tax ”			2
’ even before receiving the power to snatch cash from the bank accounts of the low paid , @entity7 had already recently for the first time started using private debt collectors to collect money overpaid in tax - credits			2
those private debt collectors proceeded to handly more than 200,000 cases in the year to 2013 alone			0
yesterday citizens advice chief executive @entity123 said : ‘ tax credits are there to make sure people get a decent standard of income , but the sharp rise in debts from overpaid tax credits suggests this policy is having the opposite effect			1
‘ seeking to improve the accuracy of tax credit payments is sensible , but @entity7 needs to tread carefully			0
@entity7 has a poor track record in managing people ’s data and dealing with overpayments			0
‘ it does not take much to push families into financial trouble and mistakes by @entity7 will be harmful			0
’ last night an @entity7 spokesman said it did not yet have the power to take money from debtors accounts , and went on : ‘ @entity7 ’s initial analysis suggests that , in the first two full years of operation of @entity48 , there will be around 3,000 cases a year that include some form of tax credit debt			1
‘ this is out of a total population of around 17,000 debtors a year whose debts are expected to be subject to this policy			0
this number is expected to fall significantly in future years			0
‘ @entity7 estimates that the debtors who will be affected by this policy have an average of £ 5,800 in tax and tax credit debts and around half have more than £ 20,000 in their bank and building society accounts			0
in all cases , £ 5,000 will be left across the debtor ’s accounts after the debt has been recovered			0

the proposed new powers will be used against 3,000 people a year who have received too much in tax credits
new power known as ‘ @entity48 ’ , and set to be granted to @entity49
around 10 *%* of families involved have household income of under £ *20k* a year
