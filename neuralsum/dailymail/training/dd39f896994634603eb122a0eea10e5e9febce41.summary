by @entity0 a judge was applauded from the public gallery of his court for jailing two thugs who battered an old soldier on @entity6			2
the yobs attacked 78 - year - old @entity8 as he made his way home from the pub where he had been raising a glass to fallen comrades			1
@entity15 , 22 , and @entity16 , 17 , hit him in the face with his own walking stick , threatened him with a knife and stole his money and phone			1
police later found a combined knuckleduster and lock - knife on @entity16 , who had taken a cocktail of cannabis and prescription drugs			1
victim : ex-soldier @entity8 , 78 , was robbed and attacked on his way home from the pub on @entity6 jailed : @entity15 ( left ) , 22 , and @entity16 ( right ) , 17 , were locked up for a total of almost 12 years			1
@entity16 was handed four years , and @entity32 got seven years , nine months there was spontaneous applause from the public gallery and shouts of ‘ well done ’ when judge @entity37 jailed @entity32 for seven years and nine months , and @entity16 for four years at @entity38 on tuesday			1
mr @entity8 was knocked over when the thugs took his stick from him in the attack in @entity42 last year , and had to crawl to a nearby house for help			1
he suffered injuries to his cheek , hand and arm and his sight has since deteriorated so much that he is almost blind in his right eye			0
the yobs , both from @entity42 , admitted robbery , having an offensive weapon and a separate offence of burglary with intent to steal			1
judge @entity0 told them : ‘ it would have been obvious to anybody that saw him he was vulnerable and elderly			0
‘ in a cowardly way the two of you attacked him			0
his stick was taken from him , he fell to the ground and you then rifled through his clothing			0
‘ you relieved him of his mobile phone and one of you used his walking stick against him , smashing it against his face			0
’ the judge also lifted a court restriction which had banned the media from naming @entity16 because of his age , saying : ‘ the public are entitled to know what is going on			2
’ the junction in @entity42 where former soldier @entity8 was attacked knuckle - duster : the weapon used in the robbery of former soldier @entity8 , 78 great - grandfather mr @entity8 , who has also worked as a bricklayer , said he was pleased with the sentences			1
‘ i ’m quite happy with it			0
i consider they got what they deserved , ’ he told the @entity83			0
‘ they hit me in the face with my stick and they took my phone			0
they are just scum really			0
they are not going to beat me			2
’ but he said he will now only go to the pub when he is escorted by his son - in - law			2
@entity98 , defending @entity16 , said : ‘ with the benefit of a clear head he fully understands the terrible nature of this crime			2
’ defending @entity32 , who already has two convictions for robbery , @entity103 said he should be given credit for his guilty pleas			0
after the hearing @entity108 of @entity109 issued a statement saying she was ‘ delighted ’ with the sentences and hoped the pair ‘ will now realise the severity of their actions ’			0
she added : ‘ this was a cowardly and disgraceful attack on a defenceless elderly man , who was even unable to retreat to the safety of his own home after @entity16 and @entity32 threw his walking aid out of reach			1
’ the sentences contrast with that of @entity128 who was given just four - and - a - half years in jail for killing @entity132 ’s sufferer @entity130 , 40 , with a punch when he asked @entity135 ’s friend not to cycle on the pavement in @entity138 last year .			1
