an amazing video has captured rare footage of giant @entity3 squid making their bodies ‘ flash ’ different colours			1
the footage also reveals the aggressive mating rituals carried out by the deep sea creatures			1
it is one of the only videos ever captured showing how these squid communicate and interact with each other underwater			2
scientists at @entity17 ’s @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity19 have revealed remarkable footage of giant @entity3 squid			1
in a video the creatures are seen ' flashing ' each other to communicate ( seen here )			2
they are also seen performing an aggressive mating ritual @entity28 squid can grow to the size of a man , up to six feet ( 1.8 metres ) long , and are incredibly dangerous , according to @entity31			1
previous attempts to observe them have seen them rip the masks off divers and attack lighting and camera equipment			0
according to the researchers , the ability of the squid to flash is not due to bioluminescence , but the use of muscle fibres			0
‘ a unique feature of all coleoid cephalopods ( squid , cuttlefish and octopus ) is the ability to change skin color through the use of neuromuscular chromatophores , ’ the researchers write in their paper			0
‘ these small organs are composed of an elastic pigment sac that can be expanded , and thereby made visible to an observer , through the action of a ring of radial muscle fibres			0
‘ these muscle fibres are directly innervated [ supplied by nerves ] by motor neurons with cell bodies in the chromatophore lobes of the brain			0
' but in the latest research , carried out by scientists from @entity17 ’s @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity19 , scientists were able to mount cameras on three of the animals - known as @entity72			1
they did this by cutting ‘ sweaters ’ from child - size swim shirts and slipping them over the body of the animals with a tube , leaving their arms , fins and tentacles free			1
this allowed them to observe some of the interactions taking place underwater			0
of most interest , seen in the latter half of the video , is how the squid flash from red to white to red again in order to communicate			2
according to lead author of the study @entity97 , this could be an attempt to communicate or a way to petition prospective mates			0
they can also flash quickly in order to camouflage themselves in the water , matching the pattern of sunlight undulating through the water			0
the squid were fitted with cameras attached to child - sized shirts to capture the extremely rare footage			1
but researchers are n't quite sure what the purpose of the flashing is			2
and the aggressive mating ritual , seen here , was also a bit of a mystery to the scientists according to lead author of the study @entity97 , the flashing could be an attempt to communicate or a way to petition prospective mates			1
they can also flash quickly in order to camouflage themselves in the water , matching the pattern of sunlight undulating through the water in the first half of the video the researchers noted ‘ arms - to - arms ’ contact between squid , which they took to be mating attempts - although they were unclear if they were successful			1
the sex of the squid fitted with cameras was unknown , while it was not clear which arms or tentacles were used in the interactions			2
‘ @entity143 of arms was also observed in several instances during interactions that did not appear to be directly related to mating , ’ the researchers noted			0
‘ in one case , a pair of secondary squid were interacting and as the primary squid approached , they both turned to face the oncoming squid and opened their arms as far as possible for several seconds and then jetted backward , away from the camera			0
’ the scientists hope to employ more @entity72 in future to further study the odd and aggressive behaviour of the squid			2
the footage is extremely rare because the squid are very dangerous			1
previous attempts to observe them have seen them rip the masks off divers and attack lighting and camera equipment video courtesy of @entity97			0
