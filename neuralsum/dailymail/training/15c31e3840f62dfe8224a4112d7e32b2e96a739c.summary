by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:29 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:47 est , 27 december 2013 scarred : @entity3 required hour - long emergency surgery to treat the deep wound a toddler required emergency surgery and was lucky not to lose an eye after she fell onto railings during a supervised playtime at nursery			1
three - year - old @entity3 was left scarred for life when she slipped and cracked her head on metal railings during a game of hide and seek at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
her furious parents claim the nursery failed to carry out a written report regarding the safety of the railings and have since issued a formal health and safety report themselves			1
@entity3 ’s father , @entity26 , 39 , said : ‘ there needs to be something done to stop this happening again to another child , and i could n’t believe when i asked to see the results of a health and safety report and was told there was n’t any written report			1
’ mr @entity26 and wife @entity35 , 43 , rushed to the nursery after they were telephoned and told @entity3 had cut her head			1
mr @entity26 said : ‘ @entity3 was sat in the office with a compress on her head			2
it was only when the paramedics arrived that we saw the true extent of her injury			0
’ @entity3 was rushed to @entity45 where she went straight into theatre for emergency surgery on her face			2
plastic surgeons spent over an hour stitching up a deep gash just millimetres from her eye , which doctors warn will probably leave a large scar			0
mr @entity26 said : ‘ her injury was so deep she was lucky she did n’t lose an eye			0
it was just horrific and she was crying her eyes out			0
’ supervised : a spokesperson for @entity17 said the playground was fully staffed at the time he added : ‘ when my wife saw her injury she almost fainted and i just could n’t believe it … they say it was supervised play , but i do n’t understand why there are railings so close to where children are playing			1
’ since the incident , which happened in november , staff at @entity17 have apologised and carried out a health and safety inspection , claiming the railing ‘ did not constitute a significant hazard			2
’ but when mr @entity26 asked to see the health and safety report , he was told by staff at the @entity73 there was n’t one , and a spokesperson from the council - run nursery said the information was given verbally to the deputy - head teacher			1
disbelief : @entity3 's father @entity26 ( right ) says the nursery failed to issue a health and safety report mr @entity26 said : ‘ when i found out the nursery had n’t even written a report , i could n’t believe it			1
i was told the findings were that the railings were a normal school fence and that this information was given verbally to a teacher			0
’ horrific : @entity3 suffered a deep wound just millimetres above her right eye he has now written and submitted a health and safety report himself			1
mr @entity26 said : ‘ i just want the issue to be taken seriously			0
@entity3 was lucky not to be blinded - another child who falls over might not have the same luck			0
’ he added : ‘ all they would have to do would is plant some bushes in front of the railings , which would prevent the children from playing near them			0
it is surely much better for children to perhaps have a scratch from a bush , rather than a horrific injury involving the railings			0
’ mr @entity26 says staff at the nursery are hoping @entity3 will return , but the family are not so sure			2
he said : ‘ we need to wait for the doctors to check over @entity3 ’s wound in february before she can go back to nursery			2
she really enjoyed it there , it is just a shame her accident does n’t seem to be taken seriously			0
’ a spokesperson from @entity17 , said : ‘ we are very sorry that @entity3 had such a nasty accident in the school playground while playing hide and seek with a friend … the playground was fully supervised at the time of the accident			1
’ the spokesperson added : ‘ following the accident there was a health and safety inspection and the officer who conducted the inspection was satisfied the railing did not constitute a significant hazard … this information was given verbally to the deputy head teacher			0
