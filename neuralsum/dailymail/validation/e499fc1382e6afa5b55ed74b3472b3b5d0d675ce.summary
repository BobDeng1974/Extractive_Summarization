@entity0 says he can have no complaints about sitting on the bench at @entity3 as he regards his rival @entity4 as the best goalkeeper in the world			1
@entity7 won the race to sign @entity0 in january , but his only appearances in a @entity3 shirt so far have come in the under - 21 side			1
despite being a three - time @entity13 winner , @entity0 is yet to turn out for the senior team simply because @entity16 's form has been nothing short of outstanding			1
@entity0 ( right ) says his compatriot and team - mate @entity4 ( left ) is the finest keeper in the world the former @entity22 man admits he does n't mind warming the @entity24 bench if @entity16 is no 1 @entity0 bears no ill feeling towards his fellow @entity26 though			1
he can only marvel at his performances			2
' you are always waiting for your opportunity to play and train every day to show your performance to the manager , ' the former @entity22 goalkeeper told @entity34			2
' but now @entity4 is at a very , very high performance level			2
' i think he is the most important goalkeeper in the world at the moment			0
so it is difficult [ for me ] to play and , of course , i must accept this			0
' for me , the top [ keeper ] now is @entity4			0
i see him every day in training			0
i watch him in every game , every week , and his performances right now are amazing			0
' negotiations have begun between @entity16 and @entity3 over an extension to his current contract , which expires next year			1
negotiations have begun between @entity16 and @entity3 over an extension to his current contract if they are unsuccessful , @entity52 will surely pounce to sign the 24 - year - old , whose @entity52 - based girlfriend @entity54 made it clear that she is not a fan of @entity57 this week			1
@entity0 , 33 , will have a tough job on his hands winning over the fans if he replaces @entity16 in goal next season			1
' every week he makes saves to help the team so i am very happy for him and also for the fans , ' said @entity0 , who is contracted until the end of next season			1
' i always hear them sing the song of @entity4 , so i think they are very happy with @entity4 for the level of performance he has shown in the last few years			2
i feel the fans are definitely very happy with the job he is doing			2
' @entity16 's latest impressive display came on monday when he prevented @entity77 and @entity78 from making @entity3 's @entity80 exit to @entity81 even more painful			1
one of the few times @entity16 has been upstaged this season came on december 28 when @entity83 pulled off a number of excellent saves to earn @entity86 a 0 - 0 draw against @entity3 at @entity88			1
@entity3 management team @entity7 ( left ) and @entity90 face the test of @entity86 on sunday @entity16 still put in a top performance in north @entity93 , and on sunday he is likely to be busy once more when @entity86 come to @entity24 thanks to @entity95 's form			1
@entity96 , a sincere believer in youth development , has been impressed by the fact that @entity86 academy graduate @entity95 has scored 26 goals in his breakthrough year with the club			0
' the way [ @entity95 ] is scoring is a reason for their success , ' @entity96 said			0
' that 's one aspect of the world of football that a big talent can stand up in one season and he is doing that			2
' i like the process in @entity86 because there also you can see that a lot of experienced players are not playing and a lot of youngsters are playing			0
@entity24 boss @entity96 identified the scoring sensation @entity95 as a factor to @entity86 's success ' in spite of that they are also very close ( to the top four ) and are playing attacking football			2
it is not easy to play @entity86			0
' they have a lot of talent ' i hope we can beat them because it will be very difficult again			0
' sunday 's game marks the start of a tough run of fixtures for @entity3 , who then face @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
the @entity143 are fourth in the table , just two points in front of @entity139 and three ahead of @entity86			0
@entity96 will be without @entity147 on sunday as he remains sidelined with an ankle injury			0
@entity149 and @entity150 are suspended while @entity151 is a doubt due to a groin problem			0
