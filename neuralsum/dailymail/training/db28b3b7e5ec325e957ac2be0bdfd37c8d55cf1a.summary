@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is in danger of becoming @entity5 football ’s most unwanted man after it emerged there has not been a single official enquiry for him during the current transfer window			1
the 26 - year - old – who cost in the region of £ 20m when @entity1 bought him in 2007 – has not played a game for the club since he was given a 20 minute run out by @entity15 against @entity16 in the @entity17 back in august			2
the former @entity19 international is officially for sale , just as he has been virtually since @entity21 took over as @entity1 manager sir @entity22 in the early summer of 2013			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is in danger of becoming @entity5 football ’s most unwanted man @entity0 , pictured in 2013 , has not played since a 20 minute cameo against @entity16 in august and is for sale @entity27 are yet to receive a single official enquiry for @entity0 during the current transfer window however it is understood that – with three weeks of the january transfer window already gone – @entity1 have not had a single serious enquiry for a player who the club hoped would be the mainstay of the midfield at @entity36 when he arrived from @entity37 seven - and - half years ago			1
while many clubs would understandably wish to wait until the summer when @entity0 will be a free agent , he is available for a knock - down fee now and would certainly be allowed to go on loan			0
however , it seems that clubs around @entity5 have been put off by stories of @entity0 ’s lifestyle and weight issues			0
at @entity1 he is privately lampooned , for example , for his liking for fast food			0
@entity0 was pictured last week having been for lunch with a female friend in @entity52 @entity0 's career at @entity1 appears doomed with the midfielder appearing just once this season attached to the @entity57 stable of influential agent @entity58 , @entity0 should in reality have little problem finding a new club			1
however his spell on loan at @entity63 last spring saw him start just four games and there was little interest from mainstream clubs in him during the summer that followed			0
one option for @entity1 this month would be pay up @entity0 ’s contract and effectively allow him to walk away from @entity36 .			2

@entity1 midfielder @entity0 has not played since august
former @entity19 international 's officially for sale but no bids have been made
@entity0 is available on a free when his contract runs out in the summer
