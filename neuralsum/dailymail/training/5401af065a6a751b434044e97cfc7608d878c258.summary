by @entity0 published : 14:46 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 15:23 est , 5 march 2013 superhero beat - em - ups are very thin on the ground			1
although @entity4 was a commendable effort , it oozed ' identity crisis '			1
the former 's trademark gore was sacrificed while the idea of @entity10 characters doing ' finishing moves ' did n't quite work			2
thankfully , @entity12 addressed this , releasing the brilliant and brutal @entity4 in 2011			1
claws are out : catwoman is one of the playable characters , and she can use her whip to damage opponents now the same team have developed injustice : @entity21 ... and it 's looking like the game superhero fans have been waiting for			1
a large part of this is down to the clever narrative design			2
similar to @entity4 , @entity12 want to make the entire experience feel like an interactive movie			1
gone are random fragmented bouts , replaced by battles cleverly connected by game - engine - rendered ( and often interactive ) cut - scenes			2
thankfully , fighting is superb			0
there are lots of famous characters available , ranging from @entity37 and @entity38 , to @entity39 and @entity40			1
each one has their own abilites and fighting style			0
@entity37 , for example , is a master of martial arts and this is reflected in his wide - range of kicks , punches and grapples			1
he can also use gadgets such as the @entity52 and explosive @entity53			0
@entity39 , in contrast , can fire lasers from his eyes and use his immense strength to throw foes around like ragdolls			0
each character has a selection of special moves			1
when you build up enough points , pressing both triggers sees them launch into a brutal combination			0
@entity37 can call in the @entity68 to run his foe down , while @entity71 sprints around the planet before landing a devastating uppercut on his opponent 's chin			1
brutal : characters all look and move realistically , while environments offer different sections to explore if both of you do a similar move at the same time , you enter a @entity83 mode , a quick - time event where you gamble points on whether you can press the button before your foe does			2
the environment can take damage , too , and clever level design means each one has multiple tiers			0
when at certain parts of a level , a move can be unleashed which launches your opponent into a new section of the arena			0
it 's a brilliant mechanic , and each level has a different cut - scene , giving you lots of incentive to explore			1
graphically , the game is strong			0
although the @entity106 looks somewhat strained rendering larger expanses and npcs in the cinematics , main character models look brilliantly detailed - clearly displaying tears and cuts after gruelling exchanges			2
it 's scheduled for release on april 19			0
@entity116 : follow us on @entity118 : @ @entity119 and on @entity120 : @entity121 .			0

beat - em - up lets you battle with some of the greatest comic book icons
developed by the team behind the brilliant ' *reboot* ' of @entity4
each character has own special moves and abilities
