@entity0 has insisted his contractual situation was never a concern after committing his future to @entity4			1
the 21 - year - old striker signed a new four - and - a half - year deal in december after months of speculation over his future , with head coach @entity8 fearing he could lose him for nothing , just as he did with midfielder @entity10 last summer			1
however , the @entity11 under 21 international was always confident agreement would be reached to extend his stay at the @entity14			0
@entity4 striker @entity0 ( right ) signed a new four - and - a - half year contract in december @entity0 ( right ) goes up for a header with @entity18 ' @entity17 during @entity4 's 1 - 0 @entity19 win @entity0 said : ' the speculation never bothered me as much as what was made of it			1
people do n't see what goes on behind closed doors , and it was never in doubt			1
' i took criticism for how long it took , but that was the process			0
at least it 's settled now and everyone knows what 's happening			0
i 've signed the contract and that 's the end of that			1
' over a month , i sat with the gaffer a couple of times and he explained to me what he wanted me to do			0
we had a good chat for half - an - hour , 45 minutes , and we got a lot out in the open and we understood each other			1
' now i know what he wants from me , and that 's made it a lot easier			0
he said to me way before the negotiations even started what he wanted me to do for this season			2
i was happy to do it then , i 'm happy to do it now			0
' the contract was just one of those things that came up between then and now			2
' for much of the current campaign , @entity0 has been asked to fill a wide left midfield berth with the club having failed in its attempts to clinch a summer deal for @entity61 's @entity60 , who excelled in that role during last season 's loan spell on @entity65			1
@entity4 boss @entity8 shouts instructions to his players at the @entity14 on sunday @entity68 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity4 's winning goal against @entity71 there is little doubt he would prefer to line up through the middle - that responsibility is currently the preserve of @entity77 international @entity76 with @entity8 largely operating a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 system - but he is happy to do a job for the @entity80 and the team			1
@entity0 said : ' obviously i want to play as high up the pitch as i can , and the role on the left involves some defending , which probably is n't the strongest bit of my game			1
' but the gaffer wants me to do it , so that 's what i 've got to do			0
it 's up to me to adapt to the way he wants me to play			0
' the manager asked me before the start of the season whether i could play on the left			2
i did it at @entity102 for a whole season and it did n't seem the same as what it seems now			2
' full - backs push on and there is defending to do , but it is the fact that we need to score more goals and get forward in numbers as much as we can			2
' @entity8 is on the lookout for a new striker with @entity76 ( right ) among those struggling for goals @entity8 has made no secret of his desire to add goals to his squad during this month 's transfer window - @entity76 , @entity0 and @entity120 have scored just eight between them so far this season - and that was a failing which might have come back to haunt the @entity123 club once again on sunday when they edged past by @entity18 1 - 0 , the same scoreline as that which famously separated the clubs in the 1973 final , into the @entity19 fourth round			1
returning full - back @entity68 's 33rd - minute strike proved decisive on a day when chances went begging , and the @entity4 very nearly paid a heavy price when @entity18 skipper @entity17 headed against the post in injury time			2
@entity0 said : ' it was n't easy , but it 's not going to be against @entity18 with the history of the two teams			1
but we 'll take the win and we 're into the next round			0
' we did have chances and @entity142 scored a good goal			0
but in the second half , we let them get back in the game and they hit the post			0
we 're happy to take the win though			0

@entity0 signed a four - and - a - half year contract in december
