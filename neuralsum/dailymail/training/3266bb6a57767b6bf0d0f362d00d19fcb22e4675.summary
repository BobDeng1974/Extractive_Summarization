@entity0 has been accused of ‘ absurdity and hypocrisy ’ after allowing three @entity4 navy ships to dock in its territories in north @entity7			1
@entity9 mps said @entity11 ’s decision to allow the vessels - including a heavily - armed destroyer - to take on fuel , food and other supplies offered ‘ succour ’ to @entity17			1
incredibly , the vessels docked in @entity20 as tensions between @entity22 - of which @entity0 is a member - and @entity4 mounted over the crisis in @entity25			1
@entity4 's destroyer vice admiral @entity27 ( pictured ) and two other vessels were allowed to dock in @entity0 territory it also highlighted @entity0 double - standards over controlling territory in @entity33 while sabre - rattling about @entity9 sovereignty over @entity35 , a @entity9 territory since 1713			1
last night wed @entity37 mp @entity36 , a member of @entity39 ’s all - party group on @entity35 , said : ‘ how is the defence alliance supposed to work if members of @entity22 behave like this ? ‘ it is completely perverse and highlights the absurdity and short - sightedness of @entity0 ’s position			1
we are supposed to be allies			0
‘ it is also blatantly hypocritical to allow @entity4 warships to use a territory which is not part of mainland @entity0 while complaining to the @entity9 about us having @entity35			1
‘ @entity0 is going to achieve nothing by pursuing these shoddy and nonsensical policies			0
’ @entity0 has held @entity20 and @entity56 , two ports of almost 100,000 people each and islands on the north @entity7 coast , for around 500 years ago			1
two weeks ago , three @entity4 navy ships - the 6,900 - tonne destroyer vice admiral @entity27 and tankers @entity64 and @entity65 - docked at @entity20 , less than 50miles across the @entity66 from @entity35			1
the vessels docked in @entity20 as tensions between @entity22 and @entity4 mounted over the crisis in @entity25 the warship , which carries 350 troops , took on board 740 tons of diesel and 100 tons of water			1
@entity4 @entity75 ships have visited @entity20 six times since the beginning of the year			1
the @entity20 newspaper reported ‘ together with the welcome and good treatment of its [ @entity4 ] personnel the visits have benefitted the city ’s businesses			2
’ the latest visit raised eyebrows as diplomatic relations between the @entity87 and @entity17 have cooled over the crisis engulfing @entity25			2
it is completely perverse and highlights the absurdity and short - sightedness of @entity0 's position			0
we are supposed to be allies - @entity36 mp armed @entity97 separatists have taken over towns and cities in eastern @entity25 in protest at the toppling of @entity17 - aligned president @entity102 in february			0
it prompted @entity4 to annexe @entity104 and send troops across the border into its former @entity108 neighbour - a move condemned by the @entity87			0
@entity22 has responded by increasing its military presence in the @entity112 , to send a message to @entity114 not to try and stir up unrest in @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
three weeks ago , the @entity75 sent type 45 destroyer @entity119 to track the vice admiral @entity27 as it approached @entity9 waters			0
in an echo of the @entity123 , it scrambled to escort the vessel past the waters off @entity126			0
even though the @entity4 ship did not enter @entity9 territorial waters , the @entity127 - based @entity119 is kept at high - readiness to respond to such events			2
@entity22 , including @entity0 and @entity9 , had formed a defence alliance against @entity4 as the @entity25 conflict continues defence secretary @entity134 said the deployment of @entity119 was ‘ pre-planned ’ after the @entity75 was notified of the @entity4 ’s route			1
some military experts believe @entity4 is testing out @entity9 defences			2
@entity139 , political director of the @entity141 think - tank , urged @entity22 to raise the issue of @entity4 naval vessels docking in @entity20 with @entity11			1
he said : ‘ @entity22 has always sought cooperation with a responsible @entity4 to further @entity146 stability in @entity147 and wider afield			2
‘ given @entity114 ’s illegal aggression against the people of the @entity25 however , this cooperation must be subject to review			0
this should include arrangements between member countries and @entity4 such as @entity4 warships docking in @entity20			2
‘ @entity22 is designed to protect us from exactly this menace			0
its posture at this time should sharply remind mr @entity114 about the costs of aggression against democratic neighbours			0
’ the @entity0 @entity162 in @entity11 did not respond to calls last night .			0
