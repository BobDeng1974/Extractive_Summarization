in a tragic turn of events a deaf quadriplegic who found internet fame with his touching , witty @entity4 and @entity5 posts has died			1
24 - year - old @entity8 captured the hearts of thousands as he took to the web with his seemingly unfaltering positive attitude and love for life despite the odds			1
but on thursday he lost his life - long battle against the severe cerebral palsy he was born with that had committed him to existence in a wheelchair			1
he succumbed to pneumonia after being admitted to hospital with a cold late last week			1
ever loyal to his committed followers and friends , @entity8 constructed a blog post that he asked his sister , @entity24 , to publish in the event that he did not survive the pneumonia			1
heartfelt : @entity8 's sister @entity24 posted his final blog , as requested by her dying brother inspirational : @entity8 's @entity5 feed has already grown to 8,000 followers after the word spread @entity33 : one @entity5 used posted a photograph of her and her daughter blowing a kiss in tribute to @entity8 if everything ended up fine , he promised , he would ' write a funny new post with lot of boob jokes in it			1
but if i not be around in a week then publish this			1
' true to her word @entity24 granted her brother his final wish , setting live the post , which he had written with the same quirky outlook he had become famous for			1
' you are all special			1
all of you unique ! ' he wrote			1
' love each other and make each other smile			2
a good joke is good medicine ! make sure everyone around you have a smile ok ? ' always do what is right			2
always ! but forgive yourself if you forget sometimes			2
i have to go now			2
i will never forget you ! " even gripped by the deadly lung complaint , @entity8 's signature humour and optimism shone through his posts as he blogged from his hospital bed , made possible by the use of a specialised compputer which would translate his eye movements , allowing him to send out messages at a pace of four words - a - minute			1
' @entity76 want to ask if there is sound in heaven			2
i guess there is but not sure if i want it ! ' here on earth i been happy to be deaf and nobody seem to be very good at describe what is sound , so i have not miss it			2
but i guess if that part of the deal then i have to take what i get ! ' say a message for me and maybe i will hear it ! or maybe angels know as i bet they do they are pretty smart lol			2
' online fame : @entity33 welcomes his new followers with a typically witty comment @entity8 uses a specialised computer which can watch his eye movements and translate them into words hospital suck - but life does n't : @entity8 appreciates the moments he has tragically , @entity8 seemed to know what fate lay ahead of him , having lost three cerebral palsy to pneumonia			1
' today i found out i have pneumonia , ' he wrote on learning of his diagnosis last week			1
' it not the nice kind either , where you cough for few days then go home and have ice cream			2
' it the bad kind where you probably donot go home			2
' upon learning of @entity8 's death saddened followers of his social media postings wrote heartfelt tributes to him			1
' @entity117 and thank you so much for just being you brother , ' commented on @entity5 user under the handle @ @entity122			1
another , @ kylielyn , posted a photograph of herself and her daughter blowing a theatrical kiss at the camera , with the words ' for you @ daveonwheels '			2
' in honor of @entity8 , am going to follow his advice and reach out to someone i have n't in awhile , ' wrote @ juanmagdaraog			1
many others posted messages with the words ' rip ' and ' goodnight ' , while the @entity142 's editor @entity141 wrote : ' we lost a good man today			1
@ daveonwheels you inspired a lot of people and your incredible personality will live on forever			1
' since his family helped set up ' @entity8 's @entity151 ' , to go along with his own blog , @entity8 's world has got much bigger thanks to virtual friends which stand in admiration for his ethics , philosophies and good humour			1
the website chive first brought wider attention to @entity8 , and said he was the definition of the website 's state - of - mind : @entity165			1
@entity8 , or @entity33 , as he likes to be called , lives in a residential home for disabled people in @entity168 , @entity169 , near his mother and his sister			1
he communicates with a @entity173 eye - gaze computer that tracks his eye - movement and posts on @entity4 and @entity5 , and on his blog he says he likes puppies , girls , funny movies , good stories and jokes , and ' yummy food '			1
writing on his blog , @entity8 - still writing at a four - word - per - minute pace , left a long answer to questions about his life			1
he said : they did not expect me to live past 15 year old because of my severe cerebral palsy			1
there are complications , like nasty thing called acid reflux and if i get pneumonia i am gone overnight			1
' but i made it past 15 , so doctors said i not live past 20			1

' the aide on duty hear me and run in turn me over and clear it			0
if he not do that i might be gone because can not turn over myself			0

' and i want you make something of yourself ! do the same and make the whole world better ! too much nasty right now , so lets make some funny and make people laugh before is too late ! ' if you all do that because of what i say then i can live on for many years lol			1
yes in a way it selfish , but i think is better this kind of selfish than someone wanting new car and best house			0
' people say i am inspirational			0
i think i am not , i am just me			0
i just hope it the best me i can be because i might have to leave soon and there is no second chance			0
