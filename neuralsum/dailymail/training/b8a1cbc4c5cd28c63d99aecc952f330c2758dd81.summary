armies of flying robots are set to fill our skies , doing everything from delivering medical supplies to spraying crops and inspecting high - voltage cables			2
but for drones to make it to the big time , they will need to learn to get around in towns and cities - without falling on car hoods or crashing into pedestrians			1

pictured is a @entity21 drone carrying a small parcel in less than a decade , as many as 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide , according to aerospace consultancy @entity24 today , technology has advanced to the point where hobbyists can fly the unmanned aircraft with their iphones			1
however , nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees , streetlights , buildings and even other drones			1
' most of these drones have very limited safety features , ' says @entity41 , an analyst with science and technology consultancy @entity42			2
if one crashes , ' it 's a four - or five - pound brick coming out of the sky			1
' the ability to be fully autonomous will be critical before legions of drones can buzz over our neighbourhoods			1
drones could help firefighters battling forest blazes by watching where flames are appearing without risking lives			2

in december , a drone flying near @entity72 almost crashed into a passenger jet similar technology does exist			1
commercial jets , for instance , are able to detect other planes in the sky and warn pilots of mountains in their path			1
in less than a decade , as many as 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide			1
however , nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees , streetlights , buildings and even other drones			1
this means if a drone falls out of the sky , it could feel like 5lb ( 2.2kg ) brick dropping off a tall building			1
some of the greatest dangers are close to airports , where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones			1
the @entity102 has reports of nearly 200 cases in the past 10 months where drones got too close for comfort to manned airplanes			1
even the military , with its expert pilots , crashes drones			2
the @entity112 has lost 116 unmanned aircraft in the last decade and now has a rate of about five destroyed for every 100,000 hours of flying time the problem is how to make the detection system small , light and cheap enough to work on drones			1
recent announcements at @entity120 in @entity121 suggest drones will be used for everything from food delivery to firefighting			2
for now , this all largely remains theoretical			0
except for a few locations , @entity128 airspace is closed to commercial drones with the dangers too great , according to regulators			1
if safety concerns can be overcome , one of the biggest industries ripe for drone use is farming			2
with the help of gps mapping , drones can survey an entire farm , find bugs or soil that is too dry or too low in nutrients			2
they could then send the exact coordinates back to a tractor that will apply pesticide , water or fertiliser only to areas in need			0
there are 2,500 unmanned miniature helicopters currently used by farmers in @entity156 to spray pesticides in hilly areas where tractors might roll over			0
similar drones are operating in @entity161 and @entity162			2
in the @entity128 , the $ 150,000 ( £ 99,000 ) helicopters are being considered for the steep slopes of @entity166 vineyards			0
meanwhile @entity167 says its drone delivery service could someday get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less			2
through its prime air service , @entity167 aims to have drones flying 50 mph ( 80 kph ) and capable of carrying up to 5lb ( 2.25kg )			1

n less than a decade , 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide ' they will become as normal as seeing delivery trucks driving down the street , ' says @entity185 , @entity167 's global vice president of public policy			1
@entity187 delivery company @entity21 is already testing a drone , but only to a remote tourist island in the @entity190 and just for urgent deliveries of medicine			2
while companies wait , more and more hobbyists are putting drones in the skies			2
many can be operated with an @entity197 or @entity199 smartphone , and some cost just $ 300 ( £ 200 )			0
some of the greatest danger of these small drones is close to airports , where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones			1
the @entity102 has reports of nearly 200 cases in the past 10 months where drones got too close for comfort to manned airplanes			1
concerns over the lack of intelligence of these drones is attempted to be addressed by researchers worldwide			1

military drone - maker @entity229 , of @entity230 , @entity231 , for instance , is trying to tackle the challenge using echolocation			2
this sends out sound waves and detects the echo reflected by obstacles			0
it 's similar to sonar on a submarine or the way bats fly around in the dark			2
other companies are using optical sensors to search for obstacles			0
but those systems have challenges , including not working well in darkness or fog			0
@entity251 student @entity250 shows his design of an ambulance drone with a built in defibrillator the first uses are likely to be in remote , sparsely populated areas			0
some of the proposed commercial applications for drones include : tackling dangerous jobs drones could be search places that are n't safe for humans , such as looking for survivors in collapsed buildings after an earthquake or inspecting nuclear power plants following a meltdown			1
they could also help firefighters battling forest blazes by watching where flames are appearing without risking lives			0
helicopters often ca n't be used because their powerful rotors threaten to spread the fire			0
scientists are also hoping drones will help conduct research inside volcanic ash clouds , hurricanes , tornadoes or other spots that are not safe for humans			0
surveying large industry according to industry experts , drones could be used to inspect miles of remote power lines quickly and at less cost			0
they may also have applications in surveying farmers ' land , finding bugs or soil that is too dry or lacking nutrients , and then sending the exact gps coordinates back to a tractor which will apply pesticide , water or fertiliser only to areas in need			0
offering better vantage points drones could create that perfect shot for film @entity308 may also allow media to find new ways to cover news and sports			0
drones provided aerial television coverage of snowboard and ski jump competitions at the @entity317			0
other uses include photographing weddings , mapping coastal erosion and showing off homes and the surrounding neighborhoods for real estate agents looking to set their listings apart			0
solving unique challenges in the future , drones could help protect endangered animals by sending real - time video and thermal images of animals and poachers to wildlife rangers			0
they may also temporarily expanding cell phone reception at special events like the @entity337			0
delivering packages might be years away but @entity21 is currently testing limited , urgent deliveries of medicine on a remote island in the @entity190			0

the @entity102 estimates that 7,500 drones – a third of all drones worldwide - will be flying in the @entity128 within five years in the @entity128 , much of the work is being done at six government - approved drone test sites , all of which are connected with universities			1
they are among the few spots in the country where unmanned aircraft can be legally flown to test what works and what does n't			0
' this is a large sandbox right now , ' says @entity362 , a mechanical engineering professor at @entity365 's @entity364 campus , one of the test site operators			0
the @entity102 estimates that 7,500 drones – a third of all drones worldwide - will be flying in the @entity128 within five years			1
the industry puts the number in the hundreds of thousands			0
compare that to the four largest @entity128 airlines , with their combined fleet of 4,728 planes			0
one of the most promising areas of application for drones is in farming			0
there are 2,500 unmanned miniature helicopters currently used by farmers in @entity156 to spray pesticides in hilly areas where tractors might roll over ' the @entity102 is just scared to death , ' says @entity387 , a mechanical engineering professor testing drones at @entity365 in @entity364			1
' @entity128 airspace is one of the safest in the world			0
it 's their job to keep it that way			0
' @entity102 administrator @entity396 says drone technology is promising but needs to be phased in responsibly			1
the @entity102 plans to release guidelines soon about who can fly drones weighing less than 55lbs ( 25kg ) and under what conditions			1
they might include the extremely stringent - and costly - requirement that operators have a pilot 's license			0
that means some of the most ambitious drone ideas , like @entity167 's package - delivery system , may have to wait			1
today , technology has advanced to the point where hobbyists can fly the unmanned aircraft with their iphones			0
however , nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees , streetlights , buildings and even other drones			1

in less 10 years , 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide
they could be used for everything from shopping to *disaster* relief
if a drone *malfunctions* , it could feel like 5lb brick falling from the sky
there is currently no working system to make drones fully autonomous
some of the greatest dangers of errant drones are are close to airports
the @entity102 plans to release guidelines soon about who can fly drones weighing less than 55lbs ( 25kg )
