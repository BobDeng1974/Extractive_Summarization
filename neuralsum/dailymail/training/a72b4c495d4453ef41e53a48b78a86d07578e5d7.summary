youth unemployment is at 27 per cent compared to overall unemployment in @entity4 at six per cent			2
@entity0 , @entity1 ’s principal research fellow , told @entity20 : ' it 's fairly startling			0
' youth unemployment goes up and down in relation to how the economy is doing			0
' the economy in @entity4 has not been as strong as years past so it is not surprising that those struggling to get jobs are those young people who are less educated and with less experience			1
' they are competing against more experienced workers in the job market and they are going to lose that battle			0
' youth that are unemployed are always the ones that struggle , the numbers are pretty nasty at the moment			0
it is concerning to have young people who have fallen through the cracks			0
' the government needs to focus their policy on the young and make sure they are getting the right training			0
times are tough : the report says @entity4 under the age of 20 are finding it tough to get jobs ' the concern is that if they stay unemployed for a long time it can lead to more serious troubles			1
' there are many young people who have just graduated and not all of them manage to get a job in their desired field			0
' @entity4 has got a reasonably weak labour market and graduates are competing against people from other universities , it is a difficult time for graduates			1
' there is not a huge amount that the government can do in a weak economy because there are lots of people looking for jobs			2
' the best thing governments can do is to ensure young people have the best education they can get and they get the experience they need , we need to get the youth in those training years			0

he added : ' as the report shows it ’s can be a catch - 22 because employers are looking for people with experience , yet young people ca n’t get that experience without a job			2
' it ’s quite staggering when you look at how many young people are out of a job compared to the rest of the workforce			0
