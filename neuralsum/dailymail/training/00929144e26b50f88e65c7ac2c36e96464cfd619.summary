by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will not be making significant additions to their squad this summer as @entity5 puts his faith in last season 's expensive flops			1
@entity5 will stick with the players who cost the club over £ 100million last year , but failed to qualify for the @entity11			2
in an interview with @entity14 , the @entity2 boss stressed that he believes the current squad is good enough to move the club forward , once they get to grips with his attacking philosophy			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity2 players try @entity21 football with the @entity22 status quo : @entity5 does not intend to change much this summer in terms of personnel flashpoint : spurs played their first game under their new boss on saturday , a fiery 3 - 3 draw in @entity31 faith : the likes of @entity35 , in action against @entity31 on saturday , will be given a chance to shine ' i think we have a very good squad already , ' said @entity5			1
' of course we always want to improve and it is possible we will add to the squad			0
but there will not be many changes			0
' last summer the club made a big overhaul and i believe in these players			0
' the @entity48 manager also insisted that expensive signings were no guarantee of success - something his new club learned the hard way last summer - and promised to avoid ' mistakes ' in the transfer window			1
' we are always looking to build - but without making mistakes - so you should not expect big changes			0
' philosophy : the former @entity61 boss admitted it will take time for the players to adapt to his style try again : @entity66 ( right ) scored just one league goal from open play last year after a £ 26m move spurs finished sixth last season , 10 points behind @entity75 rivals in the fourth @entity11 spot , as neither @entity77 nor @entity78 were able to get the best out of signings like @entity35 and @entity66			1
but @entity5 promised to change the way the team plays , bringing in the exciting football that won him plaudits at @entity61			0
' [ the philosophy ] will be to play exciting pressing , attacking football			1
template : @entity5 was successful at @entity61 with a young team playing attacking football ' at the moment we are only in the starting position , where we are trying to put this concept across to the squad			2
but we are very happy with the players and how that is going			0

@entity2 manager insists ' there will not be many changes '
@entity5 backs last season 's expensive signings to perform
