@entity0 might have thrashed @entity1 7 - 1 in the @entity2 but their coach @entity3 still was n't satisfied on tuesday night			1
the @entity5 title holders celebrated their win with a private audience with @entity8 at the @entity9 on wednesday morning but @entity3 insisted his side could still improve and that mistakes had been made in the @entity13 demolition			1
and all this despite @entity8 apparently telling a @entity0 delegation they had played ' a wonderful game ' and admitted his ' surprise ' at the margin of victory			1
' @entity0 scored five times in the opening 35 minutes on their way to a record away win in @entity95 that left them top of @entity98 with maximum points			1
' this game is an exception , an incident , ' @entity3 acknowledged			1
' it 's not the difference between the two teams , we will see that in two weeks			2
' we got a quick goal and that relaxed us , then we got another			0
@entity1 are a team who always play well , but we were very aggressive , made the right decisions and found space			1
' @entity0 took a ninth - minute lead through @entity26 before strikes from @entity69 , @entity32 and @entity26 again put them 4 - 0 up by the half - hour			1
a @entity67 penalty extended the lead and , after @entity54 pulled one back , late goals from @entity71 and @entity70 completed the rout			0
@entity34 had a particularly chastening night and was taken off at half - time after being terrorised by former @entity35 team - mate @entity26			2
@entity3 's opposite number @entity118 took responsibility for the disaster			1
@entity0 were made the bookmakers ' favourites to win the @entity2 , ahead of @entity123 @entity26 gives a thumbs up to the crowd after scoring twice during @entity0 's impressive victory @entity1 fans lit smoke bombs before the match at @entity13 on tuesday night @entity118 has taken responsibility , admitting that he made a mistake with the @entity1 's strategy ' it was a technical collapse , not a mental one , ' said the @entity134 , whose last match against @entity0 ended in a 6 - 1 defeat when he was coach of @entity134 club @entity137 two seasons ago			1
' the first person to make a mistake was myself			0
i got the strategy wrong			0
in the second half , we showed some pride and would have scored more goals if it had n't been for their goalkeeper			0
' @entity0 have showed that they are stronger than us			1
we were spectators at the match , we should have been more aggressive and compact			0
' we need to accept this defeat which shows how far we have to go to get close to the world 's best teams			2
we can still qualify from this group , but not playing like this			0
' @entity0 's @entity158 midfielder @entity70 ( second right ) celebrates after scoring @entity0 salute the crowd after winning 7 - 1 against @entity1 - their largest away win in the @entity2 @entity0 's @entity26 ran rings around @entity1 's @entity34 ( pictured , left ) who was substituted at half - time the scoreboard at the @entity13 shows the scoreline after full time as @entity1 were crushed by @entity0 video it wo n't be as easy next time - @entity3 midfielder @entity168 said the difference between the sides was not as big as the scoreline suggested			1
' it 's a stab in the heart , the city and ourselves had waited so much for this game , ' he said			2
' there was a technical imbalance , they are stronger than us			0
but i do n't think the difference is as big as the scoreline suggests			2
' this defeat can be a lesson for the future and shows us that there is a long road ahead			2
we got a bit demoralised because all they did worked and nothing came off for us			0
' goalkeeper @entity191 added : ' the only positive thing about this evening has been the behaviour of our fans			0
this was an unjustifiable defeat			0
we all take the responsibility			0

@entity0 eased past @entity1 7 - 1 in the @entity2
@entity3 described the game as ' an incident ' , and insisted that 7 - 1 does not correctly show the difference between the sides
the @entity205 said his side still need to improve on their *performance*
@entity1 manager @entity118 took responsibility for the heavy defeat
