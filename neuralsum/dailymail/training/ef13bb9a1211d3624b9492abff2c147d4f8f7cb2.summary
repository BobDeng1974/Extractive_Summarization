by @entity0 published : 16:09 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 06:28 est , 1 september 2012 on the rather stodgy agenda of the @entity3 , you are more likely to find members tabling motions than standing on tables			1
@entity7 , however , appears happy to raise the bar – and probably a few eyebrows – with this pose on the terrace			1
the outspoken @entity13 mp took advantage of the summer recess for a photoshoot for @entity17 in a members - only area of @entity20 - and then slammed prime minister @entity21 in an interview with the society magazine			1
turning the tables : @entity7 strikes a pose on the @entity3 terrace she branded him patronising and sexist and challenged him to ' spend more of his time being a conservative '			1
the glossy women 's magazine focuses on the glamorous lives and lifestyles of the upper class ms @entity7 dismissed the prime minister as ' a sheep in wolf 's clothing ' while praising his old rival @entity39 as a @entity13 who could reach out to ordinary voters			1
she previously hit the headlines when she denounced mr @entity21 and chancellor @entity43 as ' arrogant posh boys who do n't know the price of milk '			1
the mp for @entity48 indicated that she is still angry at his put - down of her at prime minister 's @entity51 's when he called her ' frustrated '			2
she said : ' it was a patronising , sexist thing to do , and that 's not the act of a statesman or someone worthy of the position of prime minister			2
' ms @entity7 , 55 , was in in towering £ 550 satin and leather @entity61 heels as she clambered on top of a table to take in the view with the @entity67 and the @entity68 as a backdrop			2
she wore a £ 1,299 blue silk dress by designer @entity71 for the terrace pose			0
she then changed into a £ 1,260 sequinned dress by @entity74 – a label popular with @entity76 and @entity77 – for another shot , which shows her with hand on hip as she leans against the ornate commons brickwork			0
for anyone who suspected she was nursing catwalk ambitions , she had a clear message			0
‘ i would n’t want to do this every day , but it is fun , ’ she told the society magazine			0
while the daring pictures show a new side to the @entity13 mp , she is accustomed to creating a stir in @entity92			2
all in a day 's work : she shows a different side in @entity17 she continued her broadside against the mr @entity43 in the @entity17 interview , describing him as ‘ a @entity97 who manipulates people and practises dark arts ’			1
under fire : @entity101 was criticised by @entity7 despite her criticisms of the party leadership , ms @entity7 insisted that she was not a natural rebel and had , in the past , held mr @entity21 in great affection			1
she said : ' i 've never been disloyal to this party until now			0
if you had asked me even 18 months ago : " would you ever vote against your party " ? i would have said : " no because the party is much bigger and more important than me			0
" and because i felt great affection for @entity111 in a sisterly brotherly kind of way			0
' amid intense speculation that mr @entity39 is positioning himself for a future @entity13 leadership challenge , she pointedly praised the @entity67 mayor			0
he reaches the parts that other politicians ca n't			0
and he had an office next to mine and i used to go and wake him up to make him vote , ' she said			0
' but what 's important is that he does more than speak inwards into @entity92			0
there are millions of people out there who need to know that there are ordinary people in @entity20			1
' they 've got this impression of us , and we 've got a responsibility to break that image			0
' just days ago she was locked in a catfight with mp @entity101 over the media ’s portrayal of prince @entity137 following his naked @entity139 billiards party			1
mrs @entity7 accused the fellow @entity13 – who was in favour of publication of photos of the prince naked – of being ‘ void of principle ’			2
and she condemned mrs @entity101 , 41 , for undermining women in @entity20 , dismissing her as ‘ an ultimate loyalist @entity149 , regardless of the issues ’ .			1

@entity7 stands on tables in a members - only area of @entity20
@entity21 should ' spend more of his time being a conservative '
she says @entity43 ' manipulates people and practises dark arts '
