career criminal @entity0 , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , believes the current system is failing are prisons working ? at a time of high re-offending rates , a surge in violence and suicides and a steady rise in prison populations , many have suggested @entity15 's prisons are in crisis			1
career criminal @entity0 , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison is well - placed to comment on the issue			1
the grandfather - of - six was first arrested aged 14 for stealing apples			0
from there he ' threw himself into a life of crime ' becoming a professional robber and committing more than 200 bank robberies			0
as he described it : ' i loved being a criminal , it was a buzz being out there on the sharp end , gun in hand , masked and taking the prize			0
' @entity0 spent time inside 34 different prisons , including the notoriously tough @entity36 where he was locked up with infamous murderers such as police killer @entity38 , who was released last november after 48 years behind bars			1
he was also imprisoned at @entity40 where he struck up an unlikely friendship with shamed mp @entity42 and took him under his wing – or as he said ' i stopped some of the others stripping him down naked and humiliating him			1
' he finally turned away from a life of crime after spending five years at @entity48 , a voluntary prison that provides a regime of therapy			1
having spent the majority of his adult life in prison , he believes the current system is failing			1
he said : ' i would raise it to the ground and start again			0
the problem is they are not rehabilitating anyone in prison at the moment			2
' @entity62 should only be for the very dangerous , which is about 5,000 to 6,000 people of the 89,000 - odd people in prison			2
as it is , there are people being locked up who do n't need to be there taking up spaces and wasting money			2
' for example many people go to prison who have drink and drug problems , but they are not a danger to the public and they should be dealt with in hospitals			2
similarly about 15 per cent of prisoners are homeless and it 's often not their fault they end up in prison			1
' but the policy at the moment is to send everyone to prison			2
they want to build new prisons but that sends out the message they want to invest in the future criminality of our children			2
they should be looking at reducing the number of prison populations			2
' @entity0 spent time inside 34 different prisons , including the notoriously tough high security @entity36 prison he was in prison with notorious criminals such as shamed mp @entity42 ( left ) and @entity38 ( right ) the seasoned criminal said the way to reduce the re-offending problem is to give prisoners proper vocational and educational training as an incentive to move on with their life after prison			1
at present , 46 per cent of adults are re-convicted within one year of release			0
' there is such a high re-offending rate because in prison people do nothing with you			1
most of the recent violence and disturbance has been because there 's no work and prisoners are locked up for 23 hours a day			1
' if i was in charge i would make sure prisoners had vocational training and some form of education , so they have something to do when they get out of prison			1
lots of people come in to prison without being able to read and write and when they are released that is still the case			2
' also when people leave prison there is no after care and they are given £ 46 which is expected to last them for four to five weeks			0
' it is a culture shock for people coming out who have served long sentences			1
it 's a great feeling of relief when you are released but after a few weeks it can be depressing and you 're left on your own			0
' he believes the use of therapy at @entity48 is the most successful way of preventing prisoners from spiralling back into a life of crime			1
@entity48 is the prison with the lowest re-conviction rate in the @entity15			1
@entity0 in the early 1980s with his son @entity166 , who was found hanged in an alley - following his son 's death , he applied to @entity48 and believed the therapy at the prison helped him turn away from a life of crime @entity0 decided to apply for @entity48 after his 19 - year - old son @entity166 hanged himself			1
at that time he was in @entity36 prison and had become an ' elite career criminal ' surrounded by high profile ' lifers '			1
but because he was deemed such a danger to the public , he was prevented from attending the funeral and felt he had let his family down			0
it was at that moment , he started to look for rehabilitation and moved to @entity48 , where he spent the next five years			1
he said : ' @entity48 works because it treats people 's problems unlike the other prisons when the prisoners are just locked away			1
they treat people with respect and there was a programme of therapy every day			0
the main thing they tried to instil in you was victim empathy			0
' but what of the argument that a tough approach should help put prisoners back on the straight and narrow ? surely if prison is a tough and inhospitable regime , convicts will be determined to never re-offend ? @entity0 disagrees			1
' my first experience of prison was in the 1970s when i was put in a ' shock ' detention centre for those under 17			1
they decided that the way to stop young people re-offending was to brutalise them so badly they never wanted to go back to being a prisoner			0
' this tactic may have worked if it was used for about 10 days , but i had it for six months which just made me think not to respect authority			0
' it is similar problem nowadays where they are making sentences longer and longer , which removes the shock factor			1
people can get used to anything as it becomes the norm			0
it 's terrifying for about four or five weeks			0
' @entity48 ( pictured ) is the prison with the lowest re-conviction rate in the @entity15 @entity0 also takes a somewhat controversial stance when it comes to drugs in prisons – a problem common to all @entity15 prisons			1
he is sceptical about the policy of mandatory testing , introduced by @entity243 in 1995			0
he believes the testing - while initially helping to tackle the problem - in the long - term has meant more prisoners now take heroin instead of cannabis			1
he said : ' when the testing came in , people started taking heroin because it got out of the bloodstream much quicker			0
' after a test people also knew they had a clear run of days when they could use it without being caught			0
' he also explained how prisoners found ways to avoid being tested positive , such as drinking three litres of water before a test to flush the drug away from their bloodstream or keeping a little bag of urine down their trousers			0
when he was locked up in @entity36 prison , @entity0 forged a relationship with @entity42 , so what is his view of another high profile criminal , @entity269 ' efforts to return to football ? despite stressing the importance of prisoners getting back into work , he does not believe @entity269 deserves his return to the game			1
his planned move to @entity277 fell through this week following threats to the club 's ' staff and families '			0
' prisoners are n't allowed out of jail unless they do re-offending courses			2
part of the re-offending process is admitting to the crime you have committed and knowing you have done wrong			0
' @entity269 has served half his sentence and still shows no remorse for what he has done			0
he may think he is not guilty but as it stands he is still a convicted rapist and what 's to stop him doing it again ? ' - between 1993 and 2012 , the prison population in @entity296 and @entity297 more than doubled : rising from 41,800 to over 86,000			0
- @entity62 has a very poor record for reducing re-offending – 46 per cent of adults are reconvicted within one year of release			0
- @entity302 is getting steadily worse : 77 of 119 prisons in @entity296 and @entity297 are now overcrowded			0
- in 2000 there were 2.9 prisoners for each prison officer , but by 2013 , it had increased to 4.8 prisoners for each prison officer			2
- the @entity310 , the agency responsible for running prisons , has to make savings of almost 25 per cent by 2014 - 15			2
- in 2012 , 47 per cent of prisoners reported they had no qualifications , and 15 per cent reported being homeless before custody			0
- in the last 20 months , 125 prisoners have killed themselves in @entity15 prisons .			2
