a @entity2 version of the @entity4 @entity3 has been developed by the secretive state , it has been revealed			1
but the slick seven - inch tablet , called the ' @entity7 ' , is unlikely to provide a window into life behind the secretive country 's border as it ca n't connect to the internet			1
since its announcement in 2012 , the computer has been developed using a basic version of @entity17 's android software			0

tale of the tablets - tech specs of the ipad and the @entity7 ' in terms of responsiveness and speed , it can almost compete against the leading tablets out there			2

' one of those who has seen the the tablet is professor @entity115 from the @entity116 , writing on the tech blog @entity118 , he said : ' the tablet has obviously been made for people who mainly use it offline			0
' this gadget is not available to all @entity2 ; just as a @entity123 is out of reach for most @entity125			2
