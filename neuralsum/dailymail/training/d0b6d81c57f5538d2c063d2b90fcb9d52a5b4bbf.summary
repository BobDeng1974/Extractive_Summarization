@entity0 has avoided clear favourite @entity1 in the group stages for next week ’s season - end finale at @entity5 ’s @entity4			1
the 27 year - old @entity6 , promoted to world no 6 in monday 's new rankings , was instead put in a group with @entity10 , @entity11 and big - hitting @entity13 @entity12 for the @entity14			1
anyone would have wanted to be kept away from @entity1 on last week ’s form in @entity17 , where he won every match in straight sets en route to the title , and @entity0 is certainly no different having now lost to him on seven of their previous eight meetings			2
while it may be good to avoid @entity1 early on , things were partly evened up by the presence in @entity44 alongside him of world no 4 @entity30 , who is the one player to have seriously fallen out of form since the @entity47 in september			2
the @entity48 , who also has half an eye on the @entity52 final versus @entity53 that follows the @entity4 event , has gone 2 - 4 in that time and is struggling to rediscover the momentum that carried him to the @entity58 final in january			0
not that @entity10 , who heads @entity0 ’s @entity59 , is any pushover and he has a record of 14 - 1 since @entity62 , his only loss being to @entity12 in the @entity65 quarter - finals last friday			1
@entity0 ( left ) lost to @entity10 in the quarter - finals of the @entity58 in @entity67 earlier this year @entity1 ( right ) lifts the trophy after winning the @entity65 on sunday as @entity69 looks on the @entity13 had been struggling before the last @entity71 event of the year , but reached the final in the @entity53 capital and has a record of 12 - 5 since @entity75			1
he and @entity11 were the last two players to qualify , with the @entity77 – the first @entity79 - born player to make the year - end finals – getting them both across the line late on friday night when he knocked out the final contender @entity82 , who will be the on - site alternate along with fellow @entity85 @entity84			0
while @entity0 has a good record in general against tall big servers he is 1 - 3 versus @entity12 but 3 - 0 against @entity11			1
his longer standing record against @entity10 stands at 11 - 11			0
after winning three @entity14 titles in six weeks @entity0 ought to be feeling relatively confident			0
regardless of the draw , the man to beat , clearly , is @entity1 , who seems to have been inspired by the recent birth of his son @entity93			0
two players from each group go through to the semi-finals with the winners of the two pools playing the second - placed individual from the opposite side			0
@entity1 ( left ) is defending champion after beating @entity85 @entity37 in last year 's final at the @entity4 video i saved my best till last - @entity1			2

@entity0 has been drawn in @entity59 along with @entity10
@entity0 will also take on @entity11 and @entity12 at the @entity4
@entity1 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity44
the season - ending *showpiece* begins in @entity5 on sunday
