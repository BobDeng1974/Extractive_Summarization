by @entity0 former @entity2 boss @entity1 could be in line for a remarkable return to @entity5 , with bookmakers @entity6 dropping his price to just 6/1 to be the next manager			1
elsewhere odds on @entity10 are as low as 7/2 , whereas just yesterday he was listed at around 140/1 by some bookmakers			0
it is a big task to fill the shoes of a manager who left the club having just been named @entity16			2
so who better to replace such a man than ... the @entity16 of the season			0
former @entity34 manager @entity33 was favourite to take over from @entity10 , but @entity2 have distanced themselves from the manager after the emergence of allegedly racist and sexist text messages , which also led to the resignation of sporting director @entity40			1
with @entity40 no longer in charge of transfer policy , and @entity33 no longer an option , @entity1 has moved up the pecking order to be the next @entity2 boss			1
ruled out : @entity46 ( left ) ruled himself out of the job while @entity33 is no longer being considered @entity46 has also ruled himself out of the running for the job , leaving the way open for @entity1 to return			1
however , the @entity50 is still not the outright favourite for the job			2
caretaker manager @entity20 and former @entity53 boss @entity52 are both at 5/1 with @entity6 , while @entity54 is favourite at 2/1			0
favourites : @entity56 manager @entity20 ( left ) and @entity54 are currently preferred to @entity10			0

@entity58 at 6/1 to get his old job back
@entity33 was favourite but no longer an option for @entity2
@entity1 left before the season started after transfer targets *dispute*
