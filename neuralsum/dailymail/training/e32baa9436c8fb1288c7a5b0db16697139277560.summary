by @entity0 for @entity1 divided : @entity2 , then @entity3 , at a press conference with @entity5 in 2011 @entity6 are urging former home secretary @entity2 to run as a ‘ stalking horse ’ for the party leadership as opposition to @entity5 becomes more orchestrated , @entity1 has been told			1
the move comes after a week of mounting criticism within mr @entity5 ’s top team , including attacks by influential peer @entity15 , party policy chief @entity17 , members of the @entity19 – and even the mother of one of his godchildren			1
now a senior @entity24 mp has claimed that mr @entity2 has been approached to run against mr @entity5 before next year ’s general election			1
the mp said : ‘ the word has gone round that @entity2 might be prepared to do it – to be a stalking horse			1
’ the mp added : ‘ there is definitely an appetite within the @entity31 for him to do it			0
whether he will agree is another matter			0
’ a stalking horse is a leadership candidate who stands in order to flush out other contenders for the position			1
but mr @entity2 , 64 , would also be a popular choice for leader because of his experience – his five @entity19 portfolios have included health secretary under @entity45 and @entity46 under @entity47 – and his electorally attractive ‘ back story ’ : he was orphaned at the age of 12 and raised in a council house by his sister before working as a postman and building a political career through the unions			1
mr @entity2 , who backed @entity55 for the leadership in 2010 , resigned from @entity5 ’s @entity19 citing personal family reasons			1
later , it also emerged that his second wife @entity59 had an affair with his police bodyguard			0
mr @entity2 is now happy in a new relationship , according to friends			2
other sources claim that shadow home secretary @entity65 , wife of shadow chancellor @entity66 , has been asked to stand against mr @entity5 but refused point - blank			1
it has been another torrid week for mr @entity5 , with senior party figures queuing up to offer criticism			1
first , mr @entity17 was secretly recorded on separate occasions talking about how bold ideas were being stifled by the ‘ dead hand ’ of mr @entity5 ’s leadership , and how he was being ‘ gamed out ’ on a weekly basis			2
labour mps are urging former home secretary @entity2 ( left ) to run as a ‘ stalking horse ’ for the party leadership as opposition to @entity5 ( right ) becomes more orchestrated @entity15 , a one - time policy guru for the @entity24 leader , warned that the party lacked ‘ a sense of direction ’ and urged his leader to ‘ take a couple of novels rather than think - tank reports as his summer reading ’ , while @entity19 complained that there had been too many ‘ wonkish ’ economic announcements that would not connect with real people			1
then , to complete his misery , writer @entity94 , a family friend who made mr @entity5 godfather to one of her children , warned he would be a ‘ disaster at @entity103 ’ because he had surrounded himself with a divided and incompetent team who were unable to cover up his ‘ weaknesses ’			2
she said : ‘ a leader who ca n’t inspire confidence , build alliances or enthuse his colleagues will fall apart in @entity103			0
’ last night , a senior @entity24 backbencher told @entity1 : ‘ @entity2 was urged by us to stand against @entity45 but flatly refused			2
' there is definitely an appetite within the @entity31 for him to do it ' - @entity24 mp ‘ the only hope is that he might now be prepared to consider it			0
‘ what is clear is that @entity66 has given up all hope of getting it , and is channelling his ambitions into @entity65			0
but she has ruled out any move until after the election			0
‘ @entity19 has divided into two camps : those who think @entity65 will go for it , and those who think @entity125 will go for it			0
‘ but they all agree on one thing – @entity5 is not up to it			2
he is out of his depth			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity2 said : ‘ you can rule out @entity2 standing			2
that is not going to happen			0
’ a @entity31 spokesman declined to comment .			0
