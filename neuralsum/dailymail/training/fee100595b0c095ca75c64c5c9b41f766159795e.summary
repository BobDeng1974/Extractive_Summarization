@entity12 had stayed indoors ever since he was puppy and had neven been for a walk , despite how much his worried owner , @entity5 , 42 , tried to coax him outside			1
the only fresh air @entity12 would get is when he went to relieve himself in a small patch of his back garden			2
aside from that he stayed indoors			0
eventually after consultation with a dog - whisperer , the family deployed some smelly cheese to coax the dog through the front door			1
mrs @entity5 , from @entity4 , @entity29 , said : ' we do n’t know what caused @entity12 ’s phobia , but we think he was spooked by something when he was a young puppy			1

he would cling to the wall and refuse to move , while howling and crying			0

ms @entity49 first explained to ms @entity5 about how her anxiety over @entity12 being indoors could be picked up by @entity12			1
' it is as much about training the owner as it is the dog			0

' @entity5 said she ' tried every trick in the book ' to get @entity12 outside , but nothing would work ms @entity49 had to work to build trust between her and @entity12 and after a few minutes of petting and playing , she tried to lead him towards the front gate , from the back garden			1
she said : ' he physically stuck himself to the wall and would not budge , so i knew it was a deep rooted fear that @entity12 had			0
' ms @entity49 used her knowledge of the dog 's physiology to tempt him outside the front gate with a serving of cheese			1

according to ms @entity5 : ' i could n’t believe my eyes			0
i had tried every trick in the book the get jack outside , including tempting him with treats but @entity49 had a hypnotic way of talking to @entity12 and using the cheese to encourage him			1
