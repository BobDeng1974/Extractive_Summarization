the global appeal from @entity0 agencies and other humanitarian organisations aims to gather funds to help at least 57.5 million of the most vulnerable across 22 countries			1

@entity6 is earmarked for $ 7.2billion , @entity23 $ 189million and @entity24 $ 405million			1
@entity26 , meanwhile , should receive $ 1.2billion , the organisation said the @entity0 says that $ 2.8billion is needed to help those caught in the @entity6 civil war			1
@entity28 is a @entity6 boy being treated at a makeshift hospital in the rebel - held @entity32 suburb of @entity34 an injured @entity6 man sits at the makeshift hospital in @entity34 following two reported air strikes by government forces the appeal is calling for $ 2.8bn to help 12.2m people inside war - ravaged @entity6 next year			1
pictured is the @entity6 border town of @entity44 , where @entity45 is battling @entity47 fighters whose cause is aided by @entity50 air strikes monday 's appeal did not however include the needs in @entity53 and the nine countries in @entity56 's @entity55 , including @entity57 and @entity58 , which will be addressed in a separate appeal in february , the @entity0 said			1
a full $ 7.2billion of the amount requested for 2015 will be aimed at helping an estimated 18.2 million people victimised by @entity6 's bloody civil war , which erupted in march 2011			1
the appeal is calling for $ 2.8billion to help 12.2million people inside the war - ravaged country next year , including 7.6million people who have been internally displaced			2
another $ 4.4 million will be needed to help more than three million @entity6 refugees and some three million vulnerable people in overwhelmed host communities in neighbouring countries , the appeal said			1
@entity6 's bloody civil war erupted in 2012 and has led to 7.6million people being internally displaced			1
this picture shows an explosion from a suicide car bomb rocking @entity44 this photo shows the destruction in the town market place in @entity44 that weeks of fighting has caused rebel fighters take positions inside a damaged building during clashes with forces loyal to @entity6 's president @entity85 who are stationed in @entity88 's historic citadel fighters from @entity47 popular defense units @entity91 ( women ) and @entity93 ( men ) gather during a short break break before heading out to assault for new positions in @entity44 this graphic shows how the @entity0 wants the aid distributed - with 18.2million people in @entity6 receiving the lion 's share of the money helping millions of people affected by other crises will also require a large cash injection next year , with @entity6 's neighbour @entity26 figuring high on the list			1
the crises in @entity109 and @entity110 are also listed in the appeal , as is the spiralling conflict in eastern @entity23			0
crises in @entity24 , @entity114 , @entity115 , the occupied @entity117 territories , @entity118 , @entity110 and @entity119 will also require funds next year			0
' this is not business as usual in the humanitarian world , ' said @entity124 , head of the @entity0 refugee agency			1
the amount requested for 2015 dwarfs the $ 12.9billion requested last december in the initial appeal for 2014			1
throughout a year that has seen millions more people flee violence and become dependent on aid to survive , those need estimates have since swelled to $ 17.9billion to help over 76 million people			2
only 52 percent of that updated appeal has been funded , the @entity0 said , highlighting a growing gap between needs and the resources available to cover them			2
however , @entity139 announced that an emergency appeal to the public had closed a $ 64 - million funding shortfall that caused the @entity143 last week to suspend food aid to 1.7 million @entity6 refugees			1
earlier @entity146 demanded an explanation for @entity149 airstrikes on two areas near @entity32 , while the @entity6 and @entity152 foreign ministers called it an act of aggression that proves @entity149 was ' in the same trench ' with extremist groups fighting the @entity6 government			1
@entity149 warplanes struck near @entity32 ' international airport on sunday , as well as outside a town close to the @entity162 border			0
the attacks are unlikely to have a big impact			0
@entity149 has already struck inside @entity6 on several occasions in the course of the country 's chaotic civil war , including a series of airstrikes near @entity32 in may 2013			2
those strikes , according to @entity149 officials , targeted shipments of @entity152 - made @entity173 missiles bound for @entity149 's arch foe - the @entity162 @entity176 militant group			0
@entity6 's reaction has been relatively mute ; in previous cases , @entity32 has vowed to retaliate without carrying out any such action			2
the @entity6 government said sunday 's attacks caused only material damage			2
@entity149 has not confirmed the strikes , and it was not immediately clear what they targeted , although activists said they hit weapons depots			0
the @entity0 children 's agency @entity191 declared 2014 a devastating year for children on monday with as many as 15 million caught in conflicts in @entity109 , @entity26 , @entity110 , @entity6 , @entity23 and the @entity117 territories			1
@entity191 executive director @entity196 said the high number of crises meant many of them were quickly forgotten or failed to capture global headlines , such as in @entity24 , @entity114 , @entity57 , @entity202 , @entity118 , @entity110 and @entity119			0
globally , @entity191 said some 230 million children were living in countries and regions affected by armed conflict			0
' children have been killed while studying in the classroom and while sleeping in their beds ; they have been orphaned , kidnapped , tortured , recruited , raped and even sold as slaves , ' @entity196 said in a statement			0
' never in recent memory have so many children been subjected to such unspeakable brutality			0
' significant threats also emerged to children 's health and well - being like the deadly outbreak of @entity219 in the @entity221 countries @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 , which has left thousands orphaned and some 5 million out of school			0
' violence and trauma do more than harm individual children - they undermine the strength of societies , ' @entity196 said			0
in @entity109 , where tit - for - tat sectarian violence has displaced one - fifth of the population , some 2.3 million children are affected by the conflict with up to 10,000 believed to have been recruited by armed groups during the past year and more than 430 killed or maimed , @entity191 said			0

vulnerable communities : choir members take @entity260 during @entity261 at @entity262 in the @entity264 district of @entity265 , which has become home to thousands of displaced @entity26 @entity267 who were forced to flee their homes as @entity270 advanced earlier this year			0
