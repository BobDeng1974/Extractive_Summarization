it might not be the most likely place to find a duchess			0
but as @entity4 gathered in a huddle with dozens of schoolchildren around tennis star @entity7 , who was busy planting trees , she looked entirely at ease			1
@entity10 of @entity11 was in the small @entity13 town of @entity14 , near @entity15 , with the tennis champ as the two opened a new primary school for underprivileged local children			1
she arrived in the early hours of monday morning at @entity21 's @entity20 for a charitable visit with the @entity23			2
mucking in : @entity10 of @entity11 watches with her new little pals as @entity7 digs holes for saplings in the grounds of the new school the two opened a refurbished primary school at 7am yesterday morning , after he met her in @entity21			1
the school , based in a small town in the centre of @entity13 , is the first to have been renovated by the charity as part of its project @entity38 ( @entity39 )			1
and the charitable pair were not afriad to get their hands dirty			0
while @entity7 dug holes to plant saplings , the @entity4 entertained the gaggle of children , keeping them in her thrall			1
despite the fact she can only have slept for an hour or two , the duchess kept smiling throughout the day			0
worthwhile cause : the duchess , who is a patron of the charitable foundation , insisted on flying in , saying it is ' not all about attending glittery parties ' natural : prince @entity56 's former wife , who also enjoys a career as a writer and television personality , made an easy addition to the crew patron : the @entity63 was founded in 2007 by the tennis champ and says its goal is to create a ' lasting change ' in the lives of children in need in @entity13 @entity70 former royal @entity4 , @entity4 , is pictured arriving at @entity21 's @entity20 children 's education is a cause close to the @entity75 's heart			1
she is an ambassador of the foundation and believes this ' means more than just going to glittery parties ' and so wanted to see their work firsthand			0
and her work , and that of @entity7 , is indeed vital : it is known that fewer than 44 per cent of children between three and a half and five actually attend school			1
prince @entity56 's former wife opened the school with @entity7 and is currently on her way back to @entity90			2
while engaging in charitable work , she also enjoys a career as a writer and television personality			0
@entity4 landed at @entity20 in the early hours of this morning @entity10 appeared in good spirits as she made her way through the airport into her waiting car @entity7 beat @entity98 in straight sets yesterday , lifting @entity13 to a 2 - 2 tie with @entity101 in the @entity103 semi-finals			1
the @entity63 was founded in 2007 by the tennis champ			0
its goal is to create a lasting change in the lives of children in need in @entity13 , and its work takes them to the most socially underprivileged communities in the country			2
tennis champion @entity7 started his foundation in 2007 @entity10 put her best foot forward in a pair of snazzy slipper shoes from @entity118 yesterday			2
the black slip - ons feature a bright red heart detail and are made of leather and suede			0
at Â£ 150 , they may have the royal seal of approval but they do n't come cheap			0
but their low heels make them a comfortable choice for travelling in .			0
