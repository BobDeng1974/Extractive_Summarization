phone cases were once simply used to protect fragile phones , but the latest wave of cases are so smart , they can predict incoming messages			1
the @entity6 uses excess energy , generated when the phone connects to a network , to show notifications , and can distinguish between the individual wavelengths created by calls and texts			1
these notifications appear on the rear of the case , before the phone registers they 've arrived , and means alerts can be seen when the phone is face down			2
it can distinguish between the individual wavelengths created by calls and texts and means alerts can be seen when the phone is face down electronic devices emit very small amounts of electromagnetic energy			1
when a call is made , or a text is sent , this energy is generated as the phone connects to the nearest mobile network			2
@entity6 harvests this excess energy to light up leds on the rear of the case			2
it can distinguish between the individual wavelengths created by calls and texts , and will show the relevant icon			1
because the case uses excess energy , it never needs charging , does n’t use the phone ’s battery , or slow down connection speeds			2
alternatively , the @entity54 version uses flashing lights around the @entity57 icon to notify of incoming messages and calls			1
cases are expected to retail from $ 50 ( £ 30 ) and go on sale in august			1
because they use excess energy , the case never needs charging , does n’t use the phone ’s battery , or slow down connection speeds			2
the @entity68 developers at @entity69 have already raised more than $ 147,100 ( £ 87,800 ) via a @entity71 campaign - three times the $ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) goal			0
‘ electronic devices emit very small amounts of electromagnetic energy , ’ explained the developers			0
the @entity6 ( pictured ) is expected to retail from $ 50 ( £ 30 ) and go on sale in august			1
because it uses excess energy , the case never needs charging , and does n't use the phone 's battery , or slow down connection speeds ‘ we decided to transform the unused energy from the @entity83 into a notification system on the back of the phone			1
‘ the @entity6 is the first intelligent @entity83 cover			0
the case knows and identifies when you receive a message or a phone call before it is even displayed on the @entity83 's screen			0
‘ [ it ] displays these notifications on the back of the smartphone with the help of @entity41 , using the free energy that is emitted by the device , converting it from the natural @entity83 's electromagnetic energy into a usable energy			0
’ the @entity68 developers at @entity69 have already raised more than $ 147,100 ( £ 87,800 ) via a @entity71 campaign for its @entity6 ( pictured ) , which is three times the $ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) goal if these latest @entity57 rumours are true , the technology would be similar to that seen on the @entity6			0
the @entity6 ( pictured ) uses excess energy , generated when the phone connects to a network , to show notifications - and can distinguish between the individual wavelengths created by calls and texts the case only works when the phone is connected to a mobile network that can receive calls and texts and is currently only available for the @entity83 , @entity117 and @entity118			1
future versions will be built for other devices , and will show a wider range of notifications , including email			0
meanwhile , @entity125 - based @entity124 has developed an @entity127 case that adds control buttons to the rear of the device			0
three touch - based options can be programmed to launch the camera , take photos , make a call , send a pre-written text and control music			0
it is available from @entity71 for $ 25 ( £ 15 ) and will be shipped from august .			0

@entity6 uses excess energy created when a phone connects to networks
it can distinguish between the wavelengths created by calls and texts
an icon lights up on the rear of the device to show an incoming notification
this means the case never needs charging , nor does it use battery *power*
@entity54 version uses flashing lights to show incoming messages
cases are expected to retail for $ 50 ( £ 30 ) and go on sale in august
