a @entity1 pensioner may have netted a place in the record books after hooking an 8ft - long , 221lb part - albino catfish , thought to be the biggest of its kind ever caught			1
the aptly named @entity6 , 68 , from @entity7 , battled the cream - coloured monster fish in the @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in			1
but the most remarkable thing about his record - breaking catch ? the previous world - beater had been caught just under two hours earlier when @entity16 , from the north of @entity18 , hauled in a 209lb catfish			1
that 7ft 11in fish had beaten a record set in november last year of 205lbs			1
mr @entity6 , a retired printer , said the fish were wild in a deep river about 100 metres wide			1
' when the fish took the bait it took me 40 minutes to haul it in , it was a nightmare , ' he said			2
' when its head came out of the water i thought , " @entity41 , it 's enormous , about a metre wide			0
" ' after it had been weighed and photographed the fish was taken back into the river and released			1
' it is a sport so we put them back , two of the guides stayed with the fish until they were satisfied it had enough oxygen in its lungs then they let it go			2
fighter : mr @entity6 battled the cream - coloured monster fish for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in it was mr @entity6 's third trip to the @entity9 , which is about two hours south of @entity58 , but he says his age means it could be his last			1
' from when you arrive in @entity58 you spend 18 hours a day , six days a week , on the river bank , ' he said			2
' from early morning you can fish until midnight			0
' he said his wife @entity63 has not accompanied him on his trips			0
he said : ' it is not a holiday place , there is no shopping			0
' you just go there to fish			0
' conservation : the fish was weighed and photographed before being released back into the river an expert catfish angler from @entity74 , who organised the trip , said they had reeled two or three big albino catfish out of the river before , but few that had topped 200lbs			1
' @entity80 of that size are very rare indeed , ' he said			0
' this is the biggest we 've ever seen			0
' mr @entity6 was joined on his fishing trip by @entity85 , from @entity86 , who himself landed a 205lb specimen			2
the group were fishing on september 23 accompanied by their guide @entity91			0
' what a day it was , ' said mr @entity91 , adding that in all his years as a guide he had never seen a brace of part albino cats , let alone two world records .			0

@entity6 from @entity1 hooked the fish in the @entity9 , @entity11
after it was photographed and weighed it was set free in the deep river
it was one of three 200lb - plus fish caught by in the river that day
