by @entity0 published : 05:06 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 12:22 est , 24 september 2012 it 's the dilemma as old as time itself : how a girl is meant to quickly freshen up her work look after a long day in the office , readying herself for a night on the town			2
well , fret no more			2
@entity7 may , after all these years , finally have the answer : the 2 - in - 1 boot			2
ready to wear : the 2 - in - one ankle boot and knee - high , now available at @entity7 the unique leather boot - the brainchild of @entity14 - based designer @entity13 - begins life as the casual @entity17 ankle - high			1
i am rarely a fan of multipurpose clothes and accessories - they to be too many things and fail at them all			2
before i saw this 2 - in - 1 boot i expected to feel the same way - and assumed i would be write it off as a gimmick			0
but in reality , both styles are worth wearing on their own merit			0
the leather - which i expected to be shiny and welly - like - was soft and had a really good leather smell			1
the shape is good , and the suede detailing and buckles at the back are a nice touch that gives them a luxe touch			0
they 'll be a great city break companion , and ideal for a winter - walk - to - pub - lunch day			0
a surprise hit - and only £ 120 too			0
@entity44 in a matter of seconds - and with a little help from a long leather cuff which fastens beneath the foot - it can become a completely different , smarter evening knee - high with buckle detail			1
available in black and brown , the innovative product costs £ 120 and was developed after customer research showed that women wanted a quick and simple solution to shaking up their work look			0
@entity58 , @entity59 at @entity7 : ' this boot is the ultimate choice in footwear for fashion - savvy recessionistas			0
' women are being more and more careful with their cash than before , but still want to invest in great quality and design			0
' we wanted to offer our customers that little bit extra , so thought what better than two on - trend , stylish boots for the price of one ! ' it 's always painful parting with a lot of money for beautiful designer shoes			1
so thank heavens for @entity79 , the shoemaker who 's taking the sting out of her £ 575 price tags by giving you two pairs of flats for the price of one			1
the generous girl has created a stunning pair of pale beige ' @entity90 ' ankle boots , crafted out of the finest @entity92 leather , with a removable cuff , allowing you to get double the wear out of them			2
and , @entity79 being a woman who trained under @entity97 , hers are shoes you are going to want to wear a lot			1
@entity79 's @entity92 leather ' @entity90 ' boots with removable cuff , available to buy for £ 575 from @entity104 in @entity105 , east @entity14			1
@entity107 's @entity90 beauties are available to buy in east @entity14 from @entity104 , priced at £ 575			0
