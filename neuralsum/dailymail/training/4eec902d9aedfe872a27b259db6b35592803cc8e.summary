criticising the @entity1 government 's response , the spokesman added to the @entity76 : ' not only are these measures affecting thousands of innocent @entity1 workers who make their living on @entity3 , but we are extremely concerned about pensioners and families with young children being forced to suffer in this way just because they want to visit the mainland			2
