at the time of kick - off , the most popular @entity5 clip of @entity6 's ' @entity1 ' goal had amassed a staggering 2.3m views in just three days			1
it 's fair to say highlights of the @entity11 's performance in @entity13 's miserable defeat to @entity14 wo n't have quite the same viral appeal			2
@entity6 , like the entire @entity13 team , was struck down at @entity17 by that most unpleasant of afflictions - a @entity21 hangover			1
@entity6 finds himself crowded out by @entity22 ( right ) and @entity23 as he struggled to make an impact during @entity13 's 2 - 1 home loss by @entity14 @entity6 gets the wrong side of @entity14 's @entity27 during the contest at @entity17 @entity6 falls to the ground under pressure from @entity22 as he tries to make an impact three days after enchanting the world with his outrageous goal against @entity34 , @entity6 cut an aloof and ineffective figure as @entity13 slumped to defeat			1
his passing was crisp and accurate in the main but failed to release his team - mates into dangerous positions as @entity13 were left stunned by @entity14 's double blast at the start of the second - half			1
any hopes of carrying the feel - good factor from thursday night into this match were quickly forgotten			0
@entity6 started on the right flank but did n't see anything of the ball during the opening stages			0
indeed , it was 15 minutes in before he enjoyed a proper feel for it , though an end product was lacking			0
@entity6 is closed down by @entity14 defender and compatriot @entity54 @entity6 takes on board some water during the game increasingly frustrated , he migrated over to the left and slowly gained a foothold in the game , picking passes in and around the edge of the penalty box			2
there was even a @entity67 pirouette on the half - way line that left two @entity14 players bamboozled but it again led nowhere			2
@entity6 's lack of influence scarcely mattered because @entity13 had the lead , gained when @entity73 headed in @entity75 's brilliant cross			1
@entity6 was at the forefront of the celebrations having helped the move along with a pass			0
. spurs were in control but @entity14 emerged from half - time a completely different proposition			0
@entity6 and @entity54 tussle for the ball as @entity13 manager @entity86 gets involved @entity6 and @entity54 ended tumbling into @entity86 's technical area @entity6 's heat map from the first half shows most of his touches came deep and wide on the right passes : 23 ( 22 short , 1 long ) passing accuracy : 91.3 per cent duels won : 3 duels lost : 5 recovered possession : 2 crosses : 1 shots : 0 chances created : 1 @entity100 had admitted in the build - up to the match that his upbrining in @entity104 meant he was unaware that the clocks go back every autumn in @entity106			1
the 20 - year - old was certainly behind time when @entity23 steamed past him straight from the kick - off and levelled for @entity14 just six seconds in			2
and the game was flipped on its head shortly afterwards when @entity112 headed home his first @entity114 goal from a @entity116 cross			0
@entity6 was n't at fault for @entity14 's two goals and it overshadowed his brightest period in the match			1
there were a few step - overs and shoulder - drops but , with @entity13 trailing , it was hardly the time for showboating			0
@entity6 tries to get the better of @entity14 's @entity129 during the @entity17 contest @entity6 's heat map by the time he was replaced by @entity133 with 12 minutes remaining eventually , @entity86 had seen enough and @entity6 was hooked off for @entity133 with 12 minutes left			1
it had been a performance that again raised questions about @entity6 's effectiveness in the @entity114			2
scoring wonderful goals against @entity139 bearing gifts is one thing			0
to replicate that impact at this higher standard quite another .			0

@entity6 's outrageous ' @entity146 ' goal on thursday stunned the world
but he was ineffective at @entity17 as @entity13 lost to @entity14
they suffered a @entity21 hangover and were caught cold
goals from @entity23 and @entity112 cancelled out @entity73 's first half opener
@entity6 failed to *exert* any influence during his *78* minutes on the pitch
