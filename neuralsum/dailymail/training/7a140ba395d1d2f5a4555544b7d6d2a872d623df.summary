by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:32 pm on 3rd february 2012 when young @entity4 kept tripping up , his parents assumed he was short - sighted and needed glasses			1
but they were devastated to learn the six - year - old had a terminal brain condition , featured in the film ' @entity9			1
' now they face a terrible wait to see if his 12 - year - old brother has the same condition and whether his sisters , aged 14 , 15 and 23 , carry the defective gene			1
heartbreaking : @entity4 only has a few years to live due to a terminal brain condition			1
his parents hope to raise enough money to take him to @entity19 @entity4 was diagnosed with @entity20 , which affects one in 30,000 children in the @entity22			1
the diagnosis means he has a life expectancy of between a few months and a few years			1
his parents , @entity26 , 35 , and @entity27 , 42 , said their lives were ripped apart when they heard the diagnosis			1
in the three months since his diagnosis of @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , the young boy from @entity30 has lost his eyesight and is now struggling to walk			1
the 1992 movie @entity9 brought the condition to public attention , telling the story of sufferer @entity37 from @entity39 , @entity40			2
mr @entity4 said : ' we thought he was a normal boy with bad eyesight , but then he started walking into a lot of things			1
' at school he ’d walk into a wall and say other children had tripped him , but the teachers had been watching and there was no one around him			1
' at that point we demanded that he had tests and it came back that his brain stems were n’t right			2
his genetics were pear - shaped			2
' we sat in meetings for hours with specialists and i asked what the cure was			2
the man said there was none , and we were blown apart			2
' i ’d never heard of the condition , and it seems nobody else has			2
they do loads of tests on newborns , and they need to do one for @entity20			2
' if we ’d have known about @entity4 ’s condition then , he might have been able to have a bone marrow transplant that would have given him a better lease of life till he was in his 20s			1
having that now would kill him			2
' @entity4 suffers from the same condition as depicted in the @entity79 - winning film @entity9 from 1992 and starring @entity80 ( pictured ) @entity82 ’s 12 - year - old brother will be tested to see if he has the same condition , as it only affects males and symptoms can start later in life			1
@entity4 was taken to @entity87 to meet @entity88 in december , courtesy of a well wisher			1
the @entity91 have also organised a family trip to @entity93 in march and @entity30 players have met @entity4 and presented him with signed shirts and a ball			1
now collections have begun around @entity30 to pay for @entity4 to have more treats , including a longed - for holiday in @entity19			1
he also wants to meet the cast of the @entity102 comedy named after the @entity104 resort			2
@entity26 said : ' since the diagnosis he has deteriorated very quickly			0
he ’s now registered blind and is struggling to walk			1
' he can make out images very close to his eyes , so we ’re hoping he will be able to see the dolphins close up and remember them			0
' whatever he wants , he ’s got			0
not in a spoilt way , but because we want him to be able to enjoy himself and be as normal as possible while he can			0
' he ’s shy , but is a very strong - willed little boy			0
the doctor ’s thought he ’d be in a wheelchair by now and being carried around , but he ’s still walking by himself and he ’s still going to school			0
' the other night he wanted to go out on his scooter , and we let him , because you ca n’t wrap him up in cotton wool			0
' his mother @entity121 , a care worker for the elderly , said : ' he still plays rough with his brother and sisters and we try to carry on as normal			0
' the school have been amazing to him and insisted he stayed there with his friends and in familiar surroundings , rather than being put in a special school			0
' @entity20 is an inherited recessive genetic disorder linked to the x chromosome			0
the disorder leaves the body unable to break down fat molecules , which build up and damage nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord			0
there are several forms that @entity20 can take			0
the most devastating type is the childhood cerebral form which @entity4 has , meaning that nerves in the brain are destroyed			1
about 35 to 40 percent of all cases of @entity20 are this type , which usually appears between four and eight years of age in boys			0
those affected will usually become totally disabled in six months to two years , and die sometime after			0
@entity121 said : ' my message to other parents is to be aware of whether their child is bumping into things or losing co-ordination , because it could be the symptoms of @entity20			0
' more people need to know about this , and they need to know about it sooner rather than later so there ’s more medical options available			0
' if someone suspects their child is ill , they must demand blood tests and scans			0
do n’t take no for an answer			0
