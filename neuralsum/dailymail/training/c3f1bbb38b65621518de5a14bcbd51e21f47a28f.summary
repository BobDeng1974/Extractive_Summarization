by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 was last night accused of undermining farmers by promoting foreign lamb during the peak @entity6 season			1
the supermarket chain currently has an offer on @entity10 lamb			1
but furious sheep farmers say @entity6 lamb is now at its best and most abundant – so there is no need to stock foreign lamb at all , let alone cut prices			1
the @entity17 accused @entity2 boss @entity18 of breaking a promise made less than 18 months ago , at the height of the horsemeat scandal , to sell as much home - grown meat as possible			2
the @entity10 lamb offer has led the @entity25 to accuse @entity2 boss @entity18 , pictured , of breaking a promise to sell as much homemade meat as possible last night @entity2 was selling two 300g packs of @entity10 lamb chops for £ 6 – a saving of around 30 per cent			1
@entity10 leg steaks were also on offer , with a 270g pack usually priced £ 4 available at two for £ 7 or three for £ 10			0
however , at the @entity2 store the @entity34 visited , @entity6 lamb was available only in the premium finest range			1
@entity17 president @entity37 said : ‘ our members are upset and quite angry that when their product is at its very best , and at its most abundant , @entity2 is actively marketing foreign produce			1
@entity6 lamb can never be better than it is in july			1
there is no reason at the moment to price - promote lamb from the other side of the world			0
’ the government has been trying to persuade consumers and retailers to buy fewer imports and more home - grown food – both in order to support agriculture and to end our reliance on unreliable foreign supply chains			0
we import 40 per cent of our food , and then environment secretary @entity59 told a farming conference in january : ‘ as @entity6 farmers and food producers you know that we grow some of the best food in the world here			2
it is up to all of us – farmers , food manufacturers and the government – to take action			0
’ @entity6 farmers export 100,000 tons of lamb a year – more than a third of the total they produce – mostly to @entity75 where it is seen as a premium product			1
yet retailers import 100,000 tons , mostly from @entity10			0
mr @entity37 said he was not against imported lamb but saw no reason to promote foreign lamb at a time when the @entity6 product was at its best in the winter months , @entity10 lamb is generally seen as a better product because the meat comes from younger animals			1
in spring and summer , however , farmers see no reason to import meat			0
mr @entity37 said : ‘ i am not against imports – consumers need choice and at certain points of the year we can see that personal taste might mean that retailers prefer to stock other products			0
but when our lamb is at its best , we can see no reason to promote foreign lamb above our own			0
’ a @entity2 spokesman said the supermarket plans a half - price promotion on @entity6 lamb soon – but could not give a start date			1
‘ we sell more @entity6 lamb than any other retailer , and we are proud to sell and promote @entity6 lamb to our millions of customers right across the @entity6 , ’ he said			2
‘ we know it is a great product and we want to ensure that we sell it in large volumes when it is at the peak of its season			0
‘ this season we expect to sell more @entity6 lamb than ever before and over the next few weeks we are running fantastic half - price promotions on @entity6 lamb in our stores			2
‘ we are delivering on our commitment to strengthen our relationships with @entity6 sheep farmers through our @entity123 , which currently supports around 200 farmers			0
we are proud of our work together to bring great quality , affordable @entity6 lamb to our customers			2
