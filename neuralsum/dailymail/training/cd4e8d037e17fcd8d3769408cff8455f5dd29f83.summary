it is known as the most elaborate and beautiful watch in the world – a £ 15million masterpiece of breathtaking craftsmanship and exquisite design			1
but the 1933 @entity6 which came to be known as the @entity7 was said to be blighted by a deadly curse			0
the so - called holy grail of timepieces brought a litany of bad luck for multi-millionaire @entity14 banker @entity13 throughout the years he owned it			1
@entity17 @entity16 ( left ) died just days before the ' @entity18 ' of watches ( right ) he once owned was sold for a record £ 15million now the curse appears to have struck again			1
hours before an undisclosed buyer bought it at auction in @entity24 for a record 23million @entity25 francs , time had already run out for the man who put it up anonymously for sale			0
the seller was subsequently revealed to be @entity16 , hailed as one of the world ’s richest men – who died mysteriously at his @entity35 home on sunday			2
the 48 - year - old @entity17 royal privately bought the fabulous watch 15 years ago for $ 11million			1
it became part of a massive art collection he built up through a love of fine works and access to a seemingly bottomless pit of money			2
no details were made public about his death but it was widely reported he had died ‘ unexpectedly ’ at his @entity54 watch ’s provenance and ‘ curse ’ was chronicled yesterday in the @entity56			2
the timepiece was named after the @entity14 businessman who commissioned it , @entity58 ( right ) , who ended up claiming it had brought him nothing but bad luck in 1925 @entity58 secretly approached @entity6 to make him the planet ’s ‘ most complicated watch ’ , with two faces and 24 complications , or extra settings			1
one face shows the phases of the moon , another the @entity72 sunset and sunrise times			0
it has an alarm , a stopwatch and perpetual calendar			0
but seven months after @entity58 took possession , his best friend died			1
months later his son @entity81 was killed in a car crash , the second of his sons to die this way			1
one day aboard his luxury yacht with his daughter @entity87 , he stared morosely at the watch and declared : ‘ such things bring one nothing but trouble			2
’ had he tossed it into the ocean that day , the curse would have ended			0
after his death , the watch passed without issue through the hands of his daughter , grandson , an @entity102 industrialist and a museum			0
then came the @entity105 @entity17 prince , one of the most powerful and influential figures in the art world , long admired the watch and kept it as part of his personal collection			1
that included anything and everything that caught his eye , from great paintings to fast , beautiful cars			0
he was a cousin of @entity17 ’s current emir , and was responsible for developing libraries and museums , for which he acquired a staggering catalogue of artworks while promoting @entity17 culture			2

but two years ago the @entity129 in @entity35 froze some of his assets in a legal wrangle with auction houses over millions of pounds in disputed invoices			0
he is believed to have handed over the watch to @entity136 ’s , and it was sold on tuesday , to help pay off his debts			1
