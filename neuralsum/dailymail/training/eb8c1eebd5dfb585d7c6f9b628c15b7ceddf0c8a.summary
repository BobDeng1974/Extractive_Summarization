taxpayers are spending £ 100million every year on interpreters to help immigrants who can not speak @entity3 , a @entity5 investigation has found			1
police , town halls , hospitals and courts are all spending huge sums on translating documents and providing professional interpreters to assist people with poor @entity3			1
this is despite repeated @entity15 attempts to save money and improve social cohesion by making new arrivals take @entity3 tests , and by telling councils not to waste money on translating leaflets			2
police , town halls , hospitals and courts are all spending huge sums on translating documents and providing professional interpreters it can be revealed today that : last night critics said that , at a time when budgets are being slashed by the government , key public services can ill afford to spend millions of pounds to help immigrants who have not learned @entity3			1
and they argued that translating can ultimately leave foreign language - speakers worse off – as they are less likely to get well - paid jobs in this country if they have not learned the language			1
communities secretary @entity36 said : ' the guidance i 've issued is crystal - clear – councils should stop wasting taxpayers ' money by translating into foreign languages			1
translation holds people back from integrating into @entity46 society			1
if they ca n't speak @entity3 , they 're not going to get on			2
@entity48 saved can be used to protect frontline services and keep council tax down			2
' under the @entity51 , @entity5 asked public bodies across @entity53 to detail their costs for written translation of documents and face - to - face or telephone interpreting			1
responses from 585 organisations , about two - thirds of those contacted , revealed they had spent £ 79 million in 2013 - 14 , indicating that the total figure is well over £ 100 million			1
most goes on face - to - face interpreters rather than document translation , which can be done free online			2
in the @entity66 , the sum spent on foreign language services has risen by 41 per cent over the past four years to reach at least £ 33 million			1
dozens of hospitals failed to respond to our data requests			2
the biggest health spender is @entity72 in @entity73 , which spent £ 1.2 million in a year			1
some hospitals have even installed full - time interpreters on their wards , such is the demand they face			1
but the details obtained by this newspaper indicate poor control of spending in some trusts			2
in one instance last january , a @entity83 interpreter charged £ 126 for more than three hours ' work , even though the interpretation took only ten minutes , during an endoscopy procedure			2
in another , the @entity72 was charged £ 162 for 4.5 hours ' work by an @entity90 interpreter , which in fact took 30 minutes during a home visit			2
meanwhile a health board in @entity94 translated a ' short video explaining what a clinical commissioning group is ' into five languages , at a cost of £ 7,500			1
another spent £ 1,678 on translating leaflets about ' the importance of registering with a gp '			1
one physiotherapist in @entity105 reported having four appointments in a day – with an interpreter required at each			2
@entity66 organisations claim that offering translation and interpretation services to those with poor @entity3 is a ' mandatory requirement '			0
in its @entity116 response , @entity114 stated : ' this is a mandatory requirement within the standard @entity66 contract that we use			0
the standard contract states , ' the provider must provide appropriate assistance and make reasonable adjustments for @entity124 who do not speak , read or write @entity3 or who have communication difficulties			0
' ' but some experts say that , in the vast majority of cases , providing this service is unnecessary			0
@entity132 , chief executive of the think - tank @entity133 , said : ' i can not imagine someone with zero @entity3 being in this country without having a relative who does speak the language , who could help them			1
it really should be the responsibility of family or friends to assist with understanding			0
' latest figures show the @entity147 spent £ 5 million on language services in a year , most on face - to - face and telephone help for jobseekers and benefits claimants			1
meanwhile , councils in @entity53 spent £ 11 million on language services in the most recent financial year , despite 2013 guidance from the government telling them translation and interpreting should be used in emergency cases only , for instance child protection			1
among the biggest spenders was the @entity162 of @entity163 , paying £ 232,592 for interpreters and £ 16,444 for written translations , mostly @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			1
@entity169 spent £ 226,280 on interpreters and £ 47,644 on translation into 61 languages			1
government data shows @entity174 spends £ 1 million a year on providing tax advice in different languages			1
some of the spending is required by law , however			0
a massive £ 15.5 million was paid out last year by the @entity179 for interpreters in court cases , as the @entity182 requires			1
police and the @entity184 spent £ 16 million between them as the @entity186 ( @entity187 ) requires that suspects understand the questions put to them by officers			1
the @entity183 was the biggest spender – getting through £ 6.7 million in 2013 - 14			1
a spokesman said : ' the mps has a legal obligation to provide interpreting			0
' private companies that make money from taxpayer - funded interpreting services include outsourcing giant @entity199 , @entity201 - based @entity200 and thebigword			1
in many cases interpreters work from home or in call centres , and translate in three - way phone conversations with foreign - language speakers and doctors or police			1
if you go to see a doctor in @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 , nobody will provide you with an interpreter if you go to see a doctor in @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 , nobody will provide you with an interpreter			0
i was talking to my sister about this the other day			0
she lives in @entity224 and says if you go to a doctor there and you speak the language , fine			2
if not , well too bad			0
you communicate with your hands			0
the situation in @entity46 regarding translators must be unique			1
i have been a @entity167 translator in @entity53 since 2008			1
when i started it was really , really busy			0
i would have three cases a day			0
i was working day and night			0
i have less work now , but i think that ’s mainly because there are so many more interpreters			0
in some ways it is surprising that more poles than any other nationals require interpreters here			0
most @entity167 nationals – specially the younger generation – learn @entity3 at college			1
some hospitals or gp surgeries use telephone interpreters but from my experience it does n’t really work			2
patients sometimes want you to be there when they are given local anaesthetic			0
i ’m next to the patient and the doctor with the scalpel , so sometimes you see things that could make you faint			0
for me the most exciting projects are crown courts			0
a year ago we did quite a big murder trial in @entity264 – it lasted for a month and a half , lots of defendants			2
we had all those reports , pathologists ’ reports , so this was very demanding stuff			0
i was born in @entity216			0
my great - great - grandfather was @entity46			1
when i was in high school i went to @entity275 , then finished my degree in @entity216 and came here , completed an interpreting diploma and started my career			2
i am a freelance , self - employed interpreter on the books of @entity199			0
the pay is £ 16 to £ 22 an hour			0
there is no guarantee of work – we wait for an email or phone call with a job offer			0
there are weeks when there is work every day			0
we never know , it ’s such an unpredictable profession			0
when @entity216 joined the @entity293 in 2004 i knew there would be a huge wave of @entity216 coming here : it ’s hardly surprising when you think about the economic situation in @entity216 , the low wages			0
people who do manual labour or work in factories can live comfortably here even if they earn the minimum wage , whereas in @entity216 this is impossible			0
@entity46 is still such a wealthy and prosperous country .			2
