by @entity0 @entity1 , 25 , received abusive text messages after she used taxi app @entity3 to book a ride for a colleague on tuesday a @entity8 woman says she fears for her safety after she received multiple abusive text messages from a taxi driver when she failed to get into a ride booked using a smartphone app. this comes as the taxi industry has warned that independent apps which provide direct customer - to - driver contact can leave passengers open to abuse			1
@entity1 , 25 , used taxi app @entity3 to book a taxi for a colleague on tuesday but when she walked outside she could not find the cab , so her colleague walked up the road to get another one			1
ms @entity1 then received three text messages and a missed phone call from taxi driver @entity29 calling her a number of derogatory names because she wasted his time			1
' f * * * in b * * * * , ' one message read			1
' i curse you s * * * w * * * * someone will waste ur time like u did mine b * * * * , ' read another			1
mr @entity29 told @entity42 on thursday he felt his privacy had been violated because ms @entity1 posted his phone number onto her @entity46 page along with his abusive messages			1
' since that day i am getting calls from private numbers and people are abusing me , ' he said			0
' i have her phone number i can give it to the media too but i wo n't do that			1
' mr @entity29 said he knew his actions were wrong but he was upset that ms @entity1 made him wait			1
twenty minutes i waited , ' he said			0
' our time is important as well			0
that 's what frustrated me i just lost myself for two minutes			0
' he added that he had tried to apologise to ms @entity1 via email through the taxi company he works for , @entity67			1
@entity3 said the company had blocked mr @entity29 permanently , and said it has banned more than 500 drivers in the past three months for not meeting professional standards			1
@entity3 is an app independent from a taxi network , which connects registered taxi drivers with passengers directly by giving drivers passengers ' mobile numbers			1
ms @entity1 , a sales and marketing assistant , said the experience was scary and she was having trouble sleeping			2
' it was such a personal attack on me over such a little thing , ' ms @entity1 told @entity42			2
' he could have been outside ready to go inside because he knew the pickup address			0
ms @entity1 said the experience was scary and she had fears for her safety ' he could come back here			2
he 's seen my face now which is the more scary bit			0
' ms @entity92 said she was even more worried now because her complaints will see mr @entity29 potentially lose his taxi license and he still has her phone number			1
' thoughts have gone through my mind like that which is not nice , ' she said			0
' the reason i have those thoughts is because it was such an irrational and unnecessary action [ over wasting his time ]			0
' because what i 've done now is worse , he could do worse than just the text message			0
' @entity109 @entity108 chief @entity107 , who represents the taxi networks in competition with apps such as @entity3 , said passengers have a right to keep their contact details private			1
' it 's a flaw in the system which allows their details be available to a driver and for the driver to then be able to harass them , ' mr @entity107 said			2
the 25 - year - old @entity8 woman has complained to the @entity124 ' and it 's good to be able to have somebody like a taxi company who provides a screening point or a booking point			1
' ms @entity1 has complained to @entity131 and the @entity124			2
the @entity124 told @entity42 the matter is being investigated			0
@entity133 did not respond to the @entity42 's request for comment			0
@entity3 ceo @entity136 said the driver 's account had been permanently suspended and the company had apologised to ms @entity1			1
' the company condemns the actions of this irresponsible driver in the strongest possible terms , ' he said			0
' we have provided his data and details to the @entity124 for investigation and in all likelihood he will never drive a taxi again			0
' he added that by reducing anonymity @entity3 was making taxis safer			2
' for example if you just flagged a taxi on the street and the driver drops you at home and then starts harassing you , you do n't know who he is , you have little recourse , ' he said			2
' but with @entity3 we 've got all the data and all the details so they can be passed on to the regulators or the police if need be			2
' @entity164 , chair of the @entity124 , said millions of people use apps like @entity3 , @entity167 and @entity168 across the world			0
' it 's a matter of choice for customers if they want to provide their phone numbers , if they do n't they wo n't use the app , ' mr @entity164 said			0
' i do n't think it 's a question of regulators stepping in			0

@entity1 called a 's * * * w * * * * ' by taxi driver she booked using @entity3
the 25 - year - old @entity8 woman 's colleague failed to get into the ride and the driver was angry she wasted his time
she is worried because the man has her phone number and work address
@entity3 said the driver 's account has been permanently suspended
