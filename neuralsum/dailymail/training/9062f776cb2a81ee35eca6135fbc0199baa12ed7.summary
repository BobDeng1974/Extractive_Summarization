a self confessed tanorexic who refused to ditch her five sunbed - a - week habit when nine months pregnant was later diagnosed with skin cancer			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , started using sunbeds when she was just 14 years old			1
but the 32 - year - old said she will never step foot in a tanning salon again , after hearing the devastating diagnosis from doctors last april the mother - of - one first noticed a ' pearly white boil ' on the left side of her nose four years ago			1
after surgery and treatment , she has now vowed to never step in a tanning salon again while at an antenatal appointment ms @entity5 mentioned the blemish to medics , having noticed it would n't heal			1
she was shocked when tests revealed the mark was a basal cell carcinoma - a type of skin cancer , after surgery to remove the disease , the flight attendant was left with a gaping hole in her face			1
she had the spot , a ' rodent ulcer ' , removed , along with the tissue around it and a skin graft using skin from behind her ear to repair the damage			1
now , after spending more than half her life using sunbeds , ms @entity5 , who was addicted to being brown , said she will never go near one again			1
she said : ' i first noticed the lump four years ago			1
' it was a small boil under the skin with a pearly white head on the top			1
' it did n’t bother me in the slightest at first			0
i did n’t think much of it			0
' the only time i thought about it was in the morning when i looked in the mirror to put my make - up on and then my make - up would cover it			1
' i thought it would go over time but my boyfriend , @entity64 , started mentioning it quite a lot to me and would tell me to go and get it checked out			2
' even when the lump started bleeding @entity5 says she still did n’t feel the need for any concern			1
she said she first mentioned it to a doctor when she went for her post-natal check - up with her son @entity74 , now two , in august 2012			2
the 32 - year - old first noticed a ' pearly white boil ' on the left side of her nose four years ago			1
it was only in april 2012 that the expectant mother raised the blemish with doctors at an anti-natal check up			1
tests revealed it was basal cell carcinoma - a form of skin cancer the small blemish was removed by surgeons , who then used skin from her ear to create a graft over the hole left			1
she said : ' the skin graft did n't take , and i was left with a hole in my face , which took over five weeks to heal , ' right			1
there are two main types of skin cancer , melanoma and non-melanoma			1
a basal skin carcinoma is a non-melanoma skin cancer , and is the most common form of the disease			1
it accounts for 80 per cent of all cases in the @entity110			0
the cancer is often refered to as ' rodent ulcers '			2
the commonest cause of a basal cell carcinoma is too much exposure to uv light from the sun or sunbeds			1
they can occur anywhere on the body , but are most common in areas exposed to the sun , including your face , head , neck and ears			0
@entity128 mainly affect fair - skinned adults and are more common in men than women			2
those at highest risk are : most are painless , and often first appear as a scab that bleeds and does not fully heal			0
some bccs are very superficial and look like a scaly red flat mark , others have a pearl - like rim surrounding a central crater			2
if left for years , the latter , can erode the skin causing an ulcer			1
bccs can be cured in almost every case			0
source : @entity145 ' the doctor told me to just see how it goes , but if i see any changes in it and it keeps bothering me , i should go back , ' she said			2
' his reaction to it did n’t give me much cause for concern			0
' i thought i was making something of nothing			2
' it was n’t until march the next year that i went for an appointment			2
' ms @entity5 said to become concerned when she was sent to @entity161 in @entity7 , in april 2012 , for an appointment with a specialist			1
she said : ' when i got in to see the doctor , he looked at it straight away and called it a ‘ rodent ulcer			1
’ ' he said , " i do n’t know what your relationship with the sunbeds is but i suggest you never use one again "			2
' i had two plastic surgeons working on me at @entity174 - one working on my face and the other taking skin from behind my ear			2
' under the local anaesthetic , i could just feel the tugging and pulling , which is a horrible feeling			0
' i could smell the burning of my flesh and because it was behind my ear , i could hear every little thing			0
' the skin graft did n’t take , and i was left with a hole in my face , which took over five weeks to heal			1
' and my ear was swollen from having the skin removed , and so painful i could n’t bear for it to be touched			2
' ms @entity5 started using sunbeds when she was fourteen , at one point averaging five times a week			1
she is now left with a small white scar , the only indication of her ordeal			2
' i was addicted to being brown , ' she said			0
' i would n’t go on a night out unless i ’d had a sunbed			2
ms @entity5 continued to use sunbeds when she was pregnant with baby @entity74 , pictured left			1
she is now urging others to think before using sunbeds , adding : ' i decided to look at it in a positive way			0
it 's a wake up call			0
it means i have n't used a sunbed since and i never will again ' ' if i went on holiday and did n’t come back with a tan , i would be disappointed about the whole holiday			0
' i even went on when i was pregnant with @entity74 , for the full nine months			0
' ms @entity5 said now the ulcer has been removed , the cancer is gone			1
but she said doctors have warned there is no reason why it wo n't return			0
she said : ' luckily , it was the least harmful form of skin cancer , basal cell skin carcinoma			1
' i decided to look at it in a positive way			0
it ’s a wake - up call			0
it means i have n't used a sunbed since and i never will again			0
' it ’s a wake - up call			0
it means i have n't used a sunbed since and i never will again ... i thought it would never happen to me			1
but it did ' - @entity5 ' i always use a factor 30 or 50 when i ’m out in the sun now			1
i used to use a factor 15 on my face so it did n’t go red , but on my body i ’d start with a factor two , and a few days later i ’d move to an oil			0
' now , i look back at pictures of myself when i went on the sunbeds all the time , and i looked ridiculous			0
' all my friends used to joke and say i had ‘ tanorexia ’ because i could never see my true colour			0
' i just thought they were jealous of my tan			0
' ms @entity5 , who is engaged to her partner @entity238 , added : ' i hope sharing my story helps others			2
' i want to get the message out about sunbeds			0
and to make people aware its not just moles they should check			0
' they should look for other changes in their skin too			0
when i think about how often i went on sunbeds since my teens , i feel embarrassed			0
' i see people coming out of sunbed salons and i feel sick			0
people do n’t realise the damage they are doing			0
' i suppose i thought it would never happen to me			2
