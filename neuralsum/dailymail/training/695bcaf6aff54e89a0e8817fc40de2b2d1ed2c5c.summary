a couple who raised eyebrows by spending £ 500,000 on a rotting cottage with no heating or electricity have proven their doubters wrong - by building an ultra-modern home worth around £ 1.5million in its place			1
@entity10 , 49 , and @entity11 , 43 , fell in love with the house in 2009 despite it being overgrown , ramshackle and on a cliff - top which is slowly eroding away			1
but despite the doubts of council planners - who said they were ' completely mad ' - they knocked down the home overlooking @entity21 near @entity22 , @entity23 , and turned it into an ultra-modern holiday let where every major window faces the sea			1
ramshackle : @entity10 , 49 , and @entity11 , 43 , fell in love with the original cottage ( pictured ) despite it having no heating or electricity and rotting away ultra-modern : the couple knocked down the home and built a sleek holiday let in its place , where every one of its four bedrooms has a sea view relaxing : the home also includes space for a hammock and ping - pong table and is let out during the peak season to holidaymakers for up to £ 5,000 a week the couple , from west @entity47 , said they almost missed the three - bedroom original cottage on their first viewing because it was so badly concealed by undergrowth			1
they wanted to revamp the house without demolishing it but were told the task would be almost impossible because so many parts of the house were rotting away			0
so they set about creating a house reminiscent of the hit tv show @entity62 , with sleek white walls and wide open spaces			0
architect mr @entity10 ensured all the main rooms of the new house face the sea , including space for a ping pong table and hammock alongside its five bathrooms and four bedrooms , one of which is a bunk bed room big enough for five people			1
they let out the home to holidaymakers for up to £ 5,000 a week in peak season and informal estimates have put its value at £ 1.5million			1
but their true profit will remain a mystery - as they have kept the cost of demolishing the old house and building its replacement tightly under wraps			2
overgrown : the couple said the original house was so consumed by undergrowth that they could not tell where it was on their first viewing in 2009 luxury : the true profit to the couple will remain a mystery , as they have declined to say how much the new home reminiscent of @entity62 cost them splashing about : even the view from the bathroom includes a wide vista of the sea from the @entity23 coast			1
the beach is a few moments ' walk away modern : the new home is larger than its three - bedroom predecessor , which had not been lived in for some time and parts of which had begun to rot away ms @entity11 , an art consultant , said : ' we were amazed by the uninterrupted sea views and thought the location was amazing - it was magical			1
' we just fell in love with it and decided to buy it , but we had no real idea what we were going to do with it			0
' the original cottage had n't been lived in for a while			0
we bought the house because of the stunning views but the cottage itself was in need of some renovation so we decided to knock it down			2
' because the building was on an eroding coastline , when we went to apply for planning the council said we were completely mad - but we went ahead with it and we are now looking into some coastal defences			0
' the ocean is just so beautiful and it 's lovely to sit in the main room and look at the stunning view			0
we have even seen dolphins and basking sharks			0
' ms @entity11 said : ' the ocean is just so beautiful and it 's lovely to sit in the main room and look at the stunning view			2
we have even seen dolphins and basking sharks ' sleepover : one of the rooms has bunk beds and sleeps up to five people - who can even turn their hand to @entity157 if the beach is too windswept smart : the kitchen has a wide window facing the sea , as do all of the bedrooms and bathrooms			0
