by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 22:03 est , 11 november 2012 veteran @entity2 host @entity1 , pictured , led a furious backlash by blaming ' cowards and incompetents ' for @entity8 's downfall @entity1 provoked fears he will quit @entity2 as the @entity12 programme 's chances of survival appeared to be fading last night			1
the fiery presenter blamed ' cowards and incompetents ' for the departure of director general @entity8 as he damned a culture of ' timeserving ' and ' biddable ' managers			1
his embittered response raised fears that he will leave the programme , where he is known for his combative questioning and refusal to tolerate evasive politicians			2
even staff on the programme are beginning to question whether it will be able to survive the crisis			2
one @entity12 insider asked whether , following two separate reviews into the programme , ' it would be the kind of brand you want to be associated with '			2
others believe a brief suspension is possible – until at least after @entity38 – while the mess is cleared up and a new team installed			2
former @entity2 presenter @entity41 said last night : ' it is a brilliant programme			1
it produces wonderful stuff and has done successfully for 32 years			0
to end @entity2 would be absurd			1
but i 'm afraid @entity2 have made mistakes and of course they are going to have to suffer for that			1
' yesterday @entity12 chairman @entity49 admitted that @entity2 could be axed , saying he would be discussing its future with acting director general @entity52			1
he did concede , however , that it would be ' sad ' if the @entity12 stopped screening current affairs in the 10.30pm monday to friday slot on @entity12 – leading to speculation a new programme is being considered			2
@entity2 has already been wounded by its decision not to air an investigation it commissioned last year into the criminal activities of the late @entity63			1
last month , following a decision by @entity66 to screen the allegations , @entity2 editor @entity64 ' stepped aside ' pending the outcome of a review by @entity70			1
i quit : @entity8 , left , makes his resignation statement last night with @entity74 chairman @entity49 that report is due within weeks but many believe the error in broadcasting false allegations on november 2 that a leading @entity79 participated in child abuse at a @entity83 children 's home could prove a fatal blow for the show			1
@entity12 insiders have been left staggered that the show 's acting editor @entity88 and duty lawyers did not insist that the claims by former care home resident @entity91 were put to @entity92			0
radio 5 live controller @entity93 – installed as an overseer after mr @entity64 stepped aside – had signed off the programme 's script 24 hours before it was broadcast			2
but it has also emerged that mr @entity91 was not even shown a picture of the innocent @entity92 to confirm whether or not he was his alleged attacker			0
following mr @entity8 's departure on saturday , @entity1 , the face of the programme since 1989 , said the director general – a former @entity2 editor – has been ' sacrificed '			1
the 62 - year - old said : ' @entity8 's departure is a great shame			0
he has been brought low by cowards and incompetents			1
the real problem here is the @entity12 's decision , in the wake of the @entity113 , to play safe by appointing biddable people			0
' they then compounded the problem by enforcing a series of cuts on programme budgets , while bloating the management			2
' that is how you arrive at the current mess on @entity2			1
i very much doubt the problem is unique to that programme			2
i had hoped that @entity8 might stay to sort this out			0
' it is a great pity that a talented man has been sacrificed			0
while time - servers prosper			0
' last night a source close to @entity1 said speculation about his leaving the show was ' inevitable ' but denied he would go			1
@entity132 mp @entity131 , who sits on the culture select committee , said : ‘ i agree with @entity1 and think this a terrible mistake			1
’ he too blamed ‘ @entity137 managers ’ for the crisis , and said mr @entity8 had been ‘ hung out to dry ’			0
he said : ‘ @entity8 has been grossly , grossly let down by @entity137 managers and the people around him			0
@entity74 chairman @entity49 , right , told @entity144 's @entity143 that mr @entity8 had been ' destroyed ' by the botched @entity2 investigation some top @entity12 names lamented the demise of @entity8 , but others took a different view			1
it took @entity154 presenter @entity153 only 13 minutes from mr @entity8 ’s announcement before she tweeted : ‘ finally			0
’ she has previously rounded on her bosses over the @entity157 crisis , asking on @entity158 whether all journalists would be treated as badly as @entity2 editor @entity64 if they , like him , made poor editorial judgments			1
@entity161 , editor of radio news at @entity163 , mentioned rival @entity164 , owned by @entity165 , when he tweeted in jest : ‘ i ’m going to tell everyone i work for @entity164			0
’ ‘ i was one of those mps who quizzed him about the @entity171 inquiry a couple of weeks ago , and we gave him a very hard time and i told him he had to get a grip			0
i am not confident anyone else could have done a better job			0
who else is going to clear up this mess ? ’ ‘ he has been done a real injustice			0
he was only in the job for seven weeks			0
as lord @entity49 said @entity8 understood what needed to be done at the @entity12 to sort out the total dysfunctionality which is clearly in the @entity12 and its news management and he was doing that			2
’ the future of @entity2 is in doubt following former director - general @entity8 's resignation			1
the announcement came after he admitted he did not know beforehand that @entity2 planned to broadcast allegations linking a senior @entity79 to the abuse scandal at a @entity83 children 's home			2
the allegations have since been exposed as defamatory and false			0
asked whether @entity2 could now survive , @entity49 told @entity197 's @entity196 programme : ' that 's one of the things we will be discussing with the acting director - general today			1
' i think one of the things that should survive is the investigative journalism which it has represented along with @entity206			0
' at the heart of our news offering has to be uncompromising investigative journalism but you have to get it right			0

@entity1 broke *silence* after witnessing *flagship* programme in *meltdown*
' he has been brought low by cowards and incompetents ' , said veteran host
@entity49 says he will discuss the future of @entity2 today
