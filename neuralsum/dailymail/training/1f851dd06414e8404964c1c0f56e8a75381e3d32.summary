the new series of @entity1 is providing millions of tv viewers with a weekly cliffhanger			1
but fans following in the footsteps of the stars are in danger of creating their own drama			0
hundreds are flocking to the 80ft cliffs at @entity11 in @entity12 , where the @entity14 show is set , risking a fatal fall from the crumbling edge or creating a landslip that could kill anyone passing below			1
despite signs warning sightseers to stay away , one group of three was photographed with legs dangling over the edge			1
the photographer , who asked not to be named , said yesterday : ‘ i was walking towards @entity42 when i saw the scariest sight			0
perched right on the edge were three people taking photos			1
they were sat with their legs dangling over the edge for at least ten minutes			1
‘ at ground level , others were concerned about their reckless , shocking and irresponsible behaviour			0
’ @entity52 , from @entity53 , said : ' anyone going that close to the edge is risking themselves , anyone below them and us if we have to go and rescue them			2
' i do n't understand why people do n't heed the warnings , there have been several accidents there			2
' people tend to want to look over the side and they do n't quite realise they are just stood on turf with nothing below			0
' it 's hard to say what effect the new series of @entity1 will have			1
local people know how unstable the cliffs are , it 's visitors that do n't understand the risks , but there are signs at every entrance to the cliff walk so people should see them			1
' tourists standing at the edge of cliffs can dislodge rocks that could fall and injure people below ironically , the show ’s tv crew were themselves criticised for taking ‘ silly risks ’ as they set up their cameras just yards from a cliff edge while filming the current series			1
one hotel booking website said interest in @entity1 had already led to a 200 per cent increase in holiday searches for @entity12 and @entity101 , following the airing of the second season			1
meanwhile , the show is also having an effect on property prices			0
the 100 - year - old chalet in @entity11 used in the series as the home of detective inspector @entity110 ( @entity111 ) is for sale at £ 275,000			1
the price is an example of what local estate agent @entity115 calls the ‘ @entity1 effect ’ , which added up to £ 50,000 to its value			1
the @entity14 drama , starring @entity120 and @entity111 , has returned to screens for a second series the @entity11 and @entity124 area experienced an increase in visitor numbers after the first series was aired in february 2013			2
fans flocked to the area to view the now famous spots , including the cliffs where 11 - year - old @entity131 was found dead at the start of the first series and the @entity42 chalet which was later revealed to be the murder scene			2
this influx of visitors is expected to start again after the second series started airing on @entity14 last monday			0
geologist @entity138 , from @entity139 , said the main risk was to people on the beach below if rocks at the top are dislodged			1
in july 2012 , 22 - year - old holidaymaker @entity145 was killed by a rockfall at nearby @entity147 at @entity148			0
mr @entity138 said : ' people do n't seem to think these continuous safety warnings apply to them but that is very much the case			0
' the main thing to be concerned about is that they might dislodge rocks and hit people below on the beach			2
' the top of the cliff is quite weathered and climbing around by the edge could cause rocks to tumble down and really hurt someone			2
' we want people to enjoy themselves , it 's just a matter of being sensible			0
' they might think they are not going to fall but that 's not the main risk			0
they should think about other people and not do anything stupid			0
' the mystery drama has a ; ready prompted a tourism boom to both @entity12 and @entity101 , where it is shot			0

photos show two people sat right on the edge of the *perilous* *sandstone* cliffs in @entity11
rocks can easily be dislodged from the crumbling cliffs , injuring *beachgoers* below
warning *issued* by *coastguard* telling tourists to obey signs telling walkers to stay on the paths
fears that tourism *due* to @entity1 could see more people injured as they look for the *perfect* view
