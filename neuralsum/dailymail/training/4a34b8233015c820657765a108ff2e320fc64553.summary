by @entity0 @entity1 did not so much wield a racket as wave a wand on the sunlit grass of @entity5 on tuesday			1
it was another masterclass in a tournament of masterclasses from the seven - time champion , in this instance against @entity11 , the usually stubborn spaniard who was dismissed from the premises in 94 minutes of imperious precision			1
comfortable : @entity1 is through to the quarter - finals at @entity5 after demolishing @entity11 unstoppable : @entity1 took just 21 minutes to take the first set , and did n't lose a point on serve in the second it was almost as if time had stood still and a young @entity1 in his first bloom was with us again			1
at 32 , he is no more likely to shrivel away and disappear from the @entity22 than its famous ivy			2
his accumulation of statistics is phenomenal ; he is the only competitor in the men ’s singles not to have lost a service game in four rounds			1
none of his matches has lasted longer			2
‘ it ’s like being a footballer , ’ he said			0
his serve was dominant , his net play clean and incisive			2
@entity35 made the fatal mistake of starting poorly , winning just 13 points in the first set and committing a horrific series of unforced errors			2
by the time he was up and running in the third set , it was way too late			1
that was the story of one @entity46 victory on tuesday			0
the other was unfolding on court two : a fractious contest won 7 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 by @entity1 ’s countryman and close friend @entity51 against @entity52			1
experienced : but it was n't @entity11 's day on @entity54 1 the two men were locked in heated dispute as the match ended , tension having built as the match developed , but they shook hands in the end and claimed that everything was mended when they came to speak to the press afterwards			2
the upshot is a @entity46 - @entity46 quarter - final : @entity51 versus @entity1			1
never before has that country had two men reach the last eight here			0
more intriguingly , set against @entity1 ’s long period of success , @entity51 outranks @entity1 – third versus fourth – in the world standings			1
he is also the player more recently to have won a @entity73 tournament , this year ’s @entity74			2
yes they are buddies , but has @entity51 ’s recent success not changed the dynamic between them ? ‘ which dynamic ? ’ said @entity1 , leaning on 17 @entity73 titles			1
‘ well , i think for him the dynamic has changed a lot			0
definitely in terms of showing up for the big moments , believing he can come through them after previously losing a lot of close matches against many of the top guys			0
sunny day : fans packed into to watch the match at @entity93 on tuesday ‘ people clearly marked him out after the @entity74 , but it started at the @entity96 and just prior to that			0
‘ so i am really happy for him that he ’s been able to keep it going strong , even though he had had some ups and downs that are inevitable after a big win like the @entity74			0
’ these are heady sporting days for neutral @entity46			0
a few hours after the wins of @entity51 and @entity1 , they scuttled back to their tvs – separate screens , different locations – to watch the @entity111 match between @entity112 and @entity46			1
a loss , though it lasted a good deal longer than @entity1 ’s match			1
well , you ca n’t have everything			0
just before the match , the big - serving @entity51 was wearing a t - shirt with the slogan ‘ @entity121 ’			1
when questioned , he said he was n’t necessarily the man – that sounded a bit boastful , he thought			0
it this was just a nickname			0
i suppose a ‘ @entity128 ’ t - shirt would be ludicrous			2
classy : @entity1 could be set for a semi-final clash with @entity131 but can he be the man against @entity1 on wednesday , just as he was in the final of the @entity133 in @entity134 ? on the negative side , due to the weather delays on saturday , will be playing his third match in as many days			1
‘ that win in @entity139 will give me a lot of confidence , ’ he said , ‘ knowing that i can beat him on the big stage			0
‘ but tomorrow it ’s going to be a different experience			0
yeah , it ’s going to be tough			0
’ did that not sound a touch defeatist ? he added : ‘ you know when you play @entity1 at @entity5 , when he ’s fit and confident and feeling well , it ’s one of the biggest challenges in tennis			1
it ’s like playing @entity131 in the @entity159			0
these guys are playing their best tennis for many years			0
’ @entity11 will most certainly attest to that in the case of mr @entity1 .			1

@entity1 took first set in just 21 minutes , and did n't lose a point on serve in the second
seven - time champion will face @entity51 in the quarter - finals
he has n't lost a game on serve throught 2014 tournament
