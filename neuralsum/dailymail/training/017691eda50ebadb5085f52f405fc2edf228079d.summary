in order to make the @entity2 phone super-thin , @entity202 's concept - dubbed @entity4 - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls @entity2 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity135 , pictured , which was 20 % thinner than previous models @entity217 ’s concept , instead , keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top			1

@entity2 ’s @entity4 has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the @entity30 would be the first to break the 4 - inch mark - but it did n't			0
@entity2 ’s ceo @entity231 has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they ’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand			0
however , with main rivals @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity237 releasing phones with screens in the 5 - inch region , analysts claim @entity2 may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people			0
last november , designer @entity18 created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the @entity4 's screen size , without drastically increasing the size of the handset			0
in his image , the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges			0
however , because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident , when it ’s picked up for example , the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced			0
according to @entity262 journalist @entity261 : ' the only way i could see something that thin working for users , is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket			0
' he continued that if @entity2 was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest , which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis , it could also pave the way for foldable devices			0
