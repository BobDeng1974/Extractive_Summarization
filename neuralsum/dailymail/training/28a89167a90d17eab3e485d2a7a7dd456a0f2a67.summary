at first glance , these photographs seem to show a scuba diver exploring the depths of an underwater world			2
but if you look more carefully you will see a tree , a bridge and even a park bench			0
in fact these incredible images show a diver traversing an @entity13 lake that floods every year , covering everything in the surrounding area			1
gallons of melted snow water pour from the nearby @entity27 mountains to expand the lake soggy seat : a bench , usually used by visitors wishing to enjoy the stunning surrounding landscape , is submerged in freezing cold water set among the snowy @entity27 mountains , the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity13 , is normally only one metre deep			1
for most of the year , visitors to the beauty spot can leisurely stroll around the picturesque lagoon , enjoying the stunning landscape from one of the benches set near the water 's edge			1
they can wander down several footpaths and cross one of many small bridges			2
but every year when the snow melts , the lake floods and submerges everything surrounding it			1
around twelve metres of water covers trees , footpaths , benches and bridges			1
gallons of clear , 7 Â° c water doubles its size from 2,000sq metres to over 4,000sq metres			1
diver @entity19 , from @entity58 , @entity59 , heard about the natural phenomenon and came to explore the lake for himself			1
video courtesy : @entity63 remarkable : in this image , you can clearly see what would usually be a footpath meandering under a tree branch expansive : every year the lake , which is usually only 1 metre deep , floods to any up to 12 metres in the deepest areas diver crossing : @entity19 crosses an underwater bridge , which usually only cover a small stream the 39 - year - old said : ' when i was underwater , it felt like i was swimming in a magical world , it was so beautiful			1
swimming over the green grass , flowers , paths , rocks and trees was like being in a fairy tale			0
' we were lucky that the sun created fantastic light rays through the water			0
my wife and i stayed there for seven days and we did three dives every day , spending one hour on each dive			0
' mr @entity19 , who works in central purchasing in @entity95 , was thrilled with the set of photos			2
he added : ' all pictures were taken in natural light without a flash			0
i am very delighted with the result because we had a lot of problems with the heavy rain , thunderstorms and wind			0
' we only had a very short time to take images when the sun was in a perfect position			0
diving is possible only for a month in the spring			0
throughout the year the depth of the lake is too low			2
the visibility is just incredible			0
usually you only see water like that this in tropical seas			0
' beauty spot : a view of the @entity20 from the edge of the water , in which you can see just how large the lagoon becomes			2
in the distance are the @entity27 mountains split view : the tree , left , can be seen both under and above the water and on the right , the bench is pictured just under the water 's surface			1
