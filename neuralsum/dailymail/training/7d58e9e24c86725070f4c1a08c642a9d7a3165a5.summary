by @entity1 reporter published : 10:36 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 04:12 est , 11 july 2013 tech giant @entity4 conspired with publishers to raise electronic book prices , a @entity3 judge has ruled @entity4 was found guilty yesterday of conspiring with publishers to increase the price of ebooks			1
the tech giant played a ‘ central role ’ in a plot to break @entity14 ’s price - cutting dominance of the ebook trade , a court in @entity11 heard yesterday			2
district judge @entity17 quoted evidence from @entity4 founder @entity19 , who died in 2011 , as saying he understood publishers ’ concerns that @entity14 ’s low price for new books was eroding the perceived value of their products			1
he also said @entity4 was willing to try pricing them higher			2
the ruling is likely to cost @entity4 hundreds of millions of dollars in damages , although it plans to challenge the ‘ false accusations ’			1
the publishers – @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 – had already settled ahead of the trial			0
@entity4 denied the charges , but the judge insisted there was ‘ overwhelming ’ evidence that it enabled publishers to dictate the price of ebooks on @entity4 ’s own @entity43			1
the @entity45 - based firm settled a separate case over ebook pricing last year with the @entity48			0
@entity4 spokesman @entity49 said the @entity51 , @entity45 - based company planned to appeal			1
' @entity4 did not conspire to fix e-book pricing and we will continue to fight against these false accusations , ' he said			2
' we 've done nothing wrong			0
' assistant attorney general @entity56 called the ruling ' a victory for millions of consumers who choose to read books electronically			0
' he said the judge agreed with the @entity63 and 33 state attorneys general that executives at the highest levels of @entity4 orchestrated a conspiracy with five major publishers			2
' through today 's court decision and previous settlements with five major publishers , consumers are again benefiting from retail price competition and paying less for their e-books , ' he said			1
the judge said @entity4 knew that no publisher could risk acting alone to try to eliminate @entity14 's $ 9.99 price for the most popular e-books so it ' created a mechanism and environment that enabled them to act together in a matter of weeks to eliminate all retail price competition for their e-books ' @entity4 attorney @entity83 had told @entity17 previously that she would set a ' dangerous precedent ' if she concluded that @entity4 manipulated e-book prices as it entered the market in 2010			1
he did not immediately respond to a message for comment wednesday			0
@entity49 said @entity4 's introduction of the @entity43 ' gave customers more choice , injecting much needed innovation and competition into the market , breaking @entity14 's monopolistic grip on the publishing industry			1
' the government claimed @entity4 and the publishers agreed to a pricing policy that forced millions of consumers to pay several dollars more for most online books			2
in her ruling , @entity17 said ' compelling evidence of @entity4 's participation in the conspiracy came from the words uttered by @entity19 , @entity4 's founder , ceo and visionary			1
' she quoted @entity19 , who died in 2011 , as saying he understood publishers ' concerns that @entity14 's $ 9.99 price for new releases was eroding the perceived value of their products and that @entity4 was willing to try pricing e-books at $ 12.99 and $ 14.99			1
she noted that @entity19 bought an e-book for $ 14.99 at the launch of @entity4 's e-book store and told a reporter that day that @entity14 's $ 9.99 price for the same book would be irrelevant because soon all prices will ' be the same			1
' the @entity126 jurist , who did not determine damages , added : ' the evidence is overwhelming that @entity4 knew of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy and joined the conspiracy with the specific intent to help it succeed ' ' @entity4 has struggled mightily to reinterpret @entity19 's statements in a way that will eliminate their bite , ' @entity17 wrote in the 160 - page opinion			1
" its efforts have proven fruitless			0
" @entity17 said damages could be determined at a later point , though she did not immediately schedule a trial on them			0
the state attorneys general are seeking unspecified damages			0
the federal government is seeking an order that @entity4 be banned for two years from agreements that let publishers rather than retailers set prices and that the company be prohibited from future antitrust law violations			2
the @entity63 also is asking @entity4 to establish an antitrust compliance program and antitrust training for executives and to put in place an independent monitoring trustee			0
the trial had featured testimony from executives for @entity4 , publishers and @entity162 - based @entity14			0
witnesses from the publishing industry conceded that they were disappointed that @entity14 was selling e-books so inexpensively when @entity4 came along in late 2009 with plans for its e-book store			0
' through their conspiracy they forced @entity14 ( and other resellers ) to relinquish retail pricing authority and then they raised retail e-book prices , ' @entity17 wrote			0
' those higher prices were not the result of regular market forces but of a scheme in which @entity4 was a full participant			0

@entity3 court ruled that @entity4 ' created environment ' that enabled it to act with others to eliminate price competition
@entity126 jurist , who did not determine damages , said : ' the evidence is overwhelming '
@entity4 said it planned to appeal and denied an *wrongdoing*
