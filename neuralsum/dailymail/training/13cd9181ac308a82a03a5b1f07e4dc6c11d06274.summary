by @entity0 @entity1 are hoping to take advantage of @entity4 ’s contract stand - off at @entity5 by taking the 32 - year - old midfielder to @entity7 the @entity8 have targeted @entity4 as they plan major changes this summer with two on - loan players @entity11 due to the return to their @entity17 clubs and a third loanee @entity19 heading back to @entity20			1
@entity4 was in the @entity5 side that captured the @entity22 last weekend , their first trophy for nine years but has only 12 months left on his contract and has hit out at the club ’s policy of only offering one - year extensions to players aged over 30			1

for me , a much bigger asset is someone who has played 125 games in three years compared to someone who played 25 , if he is 20 - years - old			0
' that ’s my opinion			0
‘ i understand the club point of view : “ @entity4 is not a £ 25m player because he is not 22 any more ”			2
but i know what else i can give			0
so it ’s to find the right balance between mentalities			0
we need to analyse and talk about it			0
' @entity1 , known in @entity8 as @entity1 , qualified for next season ’s @entity60 by finishing fourth in @entity7 and they see @entity4 as an ideal foil for strikers @entity63 and @entity65			2
@entity66 values @entity4 highly and wo n’t want to lose the @entity37 he signed from @entity67 in 2011 but he is unlikely to push to break club policy and give him a long - term deal			1
drama : @entity5 beat @entity71 3 - 2 in the final , with @entity31 ( right ) netting the winner in extra time fiery : @entity4 believes that he still has plenty to give , even at the age of 32			2
