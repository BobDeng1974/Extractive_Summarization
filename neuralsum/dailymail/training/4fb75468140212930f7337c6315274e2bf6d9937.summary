by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 05:47 est , 12 july 2012 human rights law will be extended to include the right to claim benefits and enjoy a comfortable standard of living courtesy of the taxpayer under plans unveiled last night			1
a government panel of experts is considering whether @entity11 ’s @entity10 – which is already hugely controversial – should be extended to include so - called ‘ socio - economic rights ’			1
this would allow the jobless to take the government to court if ministers did not provide a minimum standard of living			1
earlier this week , a report by the @entity20 suggested a family of four needed an income of almost £ 37,000 to have a satisfactory lifestyle			2
farce : human rights law will be extended to include the right to enjoy a comfortable standard of living courtesy of the taxpayer ( picture posed by models ) the ‘ @entity35 on a @entity36 ’ was set up by @entity32 to end the rampant abuse of human rights laws			1
originally , the prime minister had pledged to scrap @entity11 ’s @entity10 and replace it with a @entity38 @entity36 , which would stop the system being abused by criminals and those who refuse to work			1
but , after being forced into a coalition with the @entity42 he had to downgrade his pledge			0
instead , he established the commission to decide the best way forward			0
yesterday , despite deliberating for 15 months , the panel said it had not decided whether to recommend any change to the @entity10			1
but it said that , if it did decide to opt for a @entity36 , it wanted to consider suggestions from the public and pro-human rights groups on whether to add on yet more ‘ human rights ’ which must be respected by @entity57 and the courts			2
frustration : the prime minister set up the commission to end the rampant abuse of human rights laws under a section headed ‘ @entity65 ? ’ , it suggests ‘ a right to equality ’ ; a ‘ right to administrative justice ’ , which would build on the existing ‘ right to a fair trial ’ ; ‘ rights for victims ’ ; ‘ children ’s rights ’ ; ‘ socio - economic rights ’ ; and ‘ environmental rights ’			1
the last two are likely to be the most contentious			0
under ‘ socio - economic rights ’ , it says : ‘ such rights , which are found in a number of bills of rights in other countries , can include rights to adequate healthcare and housing , a right to education , a right to a minimum standard of living , and a range of other social security entitlements			1
’ on benefits , the panel suggest copying wording from the @entity93			0
this promises a right to ‘ social security , including , if they are unable to support themselves and their dependants , appropriate social assistance ’			0
on the environment , the panel suggests that everyone should have the right to live in a world that ‘ is not harmful to their health or well - being ’ where there is ‘ secure ecologically sustainable development and the use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development ’			1
critics fear this could lead to all building projects being automatically challenged under human rights law – creating a boon for lawyers but stifling economic growth			1
mps said they were hugely disappointed with the report , which also suggests the courts having the power to strike down laws made by @entity57			0
currently , judges can rule that a law is incompatible with the @entity10 , but must leave it to the politicians to decide what to do next			1
@entity131 mp @entity130 said : ‘ the @entity35 risks being hijacked by the human rights lobby			2
it is supposed to be looking at how to scale back the rights inflation and compensation culture that has undermined law enforcement , democratic accountability and personal responsibility			2
compensation culture : mp @entity141 said the commission risked being hijacked by the human rights lobby ‘ instead , it has churned out proposals for even more human rights			2
that would give judges enormous power to set social policy without proper democratic accountability , and cost the taxpayer a fortune			0
’ mr @entity32 voiced his frustration in may at slow progress on his plans to scrap the @entity10			1
he blamed delays on the compromises made necessary by being in a coalition , but said he remained determined to press ahead with the change			0
sir @entity161 – chairman of the panel , which will make its final recommendations later this year – said : ‘ i am pleased that the @entity35 has published this second @entity165			0
we want to hear from as many individuals and interested parties as possible			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity35 on a @entity36 said : ' we have not taken a decision on whether we need a @entity38 @entity36 , or what it should contain			0
' this consultation is merely seeking further public opinion on the issue and reflects the views we received following the discussion paper we published last year			0
it does not in any way pre-empt our views or recommendations , which we will provide to the government for their consideration at the end of the year			2

experts are considering whether @entity11 *'s* @entity10 should include socio - economic rights
job - seekers could take the government to court if ministers failed to provide minimum standard of living
