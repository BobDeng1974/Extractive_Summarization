these boys could not have done this – they have never been around guns or explosives			1
' listen to what their friends , their teachers and their sports coaches are saying			2
' after the marathon bombs @entity5 was going about his normal daily life			2
he was n’t on the run or in hiding			2
it was only after the @entity50 put their photographs out that all the trouble happened			2
