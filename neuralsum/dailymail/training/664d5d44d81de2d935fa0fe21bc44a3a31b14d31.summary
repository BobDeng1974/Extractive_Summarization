by @entity0 towering 40ft high , measuring 60ft wide and estimated to weigh up to 18,000 tons , it ’s enough to take your breath away - quite literally			1
so pity the residents of a neatly kept suburban @entity5 who have had to put up with this huge mountain of stinking rubbish at the end of the road for the past three years			2
the @entity11 is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm that runs the waste disposal site , claiming it has not been paying for the mound to be treated and sent on for disposal or recycling elsewhere			1
the price of a three - bedroom house in the road has plummeted from £ 250,000 to £ 225,000 stinking : a site worker scavenges through new rubbish at the site			1
the smell means that residents can not open their windows or enjoy their gardens all the while the residents of @entity38 in @entity39 , in @entity40 , south - east @entity41 , have not been able to enjoy their gardens and dare not open their windows to cool down in summer			1
not impressed : @entity42 , 74 , a retired printer who has lived there since 1971 , said : ‘ it ’s a nightmare , all the dust , the huge lorries with their reversing beepers			0
on top of that , they say the price of a three - bedroom house in the road has plummeted from £ 250,000 to £ 225,000			1
@entity42 , 74 , a retired printer who has lived there since 1971 , said : ‘ it ’s a nightmare , all the dust , the huge lorries with their reversing beepers			0
‘ the smell can be overpowering outside , like burnt plastic			2
it sometimes permeates into my house			0
i ’ve been violently sick on occasions			0
‘ i ’m sure we get more flies round here than we used to , and i ’ve seen a few rats			0
i ’d do anything to get rid of it			0
’ @entity67 , 33 , an @entity69 administrative worker , and her husband @entity70 , 35 , who runs an off - licence , fear for their daughter @entity73 , three , and son @entity66 , eight			2
@entity67 said : ‘ it ’s really horrible , and we ’re really scared when there are fires			0
you ca n’t even sit in the garden because of the smell and we keep the windows shut because of the dust			1
‘ about every eight weeks the children feel sick for a couple of weeks			0
they were n’t like that before we moved here			0
’ the @entity11 said it served notice on @entity88 to remove all waste from the site by june 2013			1
according to the firm ’s website , they ‘ specialise in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity ’			0
when the firm failed to act , the agency took the case to the @entity102 and obtained an order to make it comply by may 1 this year , but it still failed to do so			2
now the case is back in court			0
it was adjourned yesterday to continue next week			2
eyesore : according to the firm ’s website , they ' specialise in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity ' vast : the scale of the mountain of waste was captured in this aerial shot earlier this year giant : the pile of dirt dwarfs the sizeable suburban houses , blocking their view of the idyllic lake @entity125 : site workers are dwarfed by the looming pile			1
the @entity11 is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm that runs the waste disposal site unsanitary : a fire burning at the @entity88 site			1
the neat cul - de - sac has had more flies than it did before the rubbish pile - some residents even reported seeing rats			1

the 40ft high pile of rubbish , which is also 60ft wide , towers above a street in @entity40 , south - east @entity41
overpowering smell means residents ca *n't* open their windows and they say their house prices have plummeted
@entity11 is locked in a legal battle with the firm that runs the site and the case will continue next week
