by @entity0 a surfer who was racially abused by a stand - up paddle boarder and told to ‘ f * * * off back to @entity4 ’ has described the tirade of verbal abuse he received as ‘ disgusting ’			1
@entity8 @entity7 , 29 , caught the astonishing incident on camera which saw him subjected to the abuse after he accidentally caught the same wave as the stand - up paddle ( @entity14 ) boarder			1
the footage shows the @entity14 rider , who had a @entity18 – the flag of @entity20 – sticker stuck to the front of his board , launch a number of expletives at mr @entity7 during the surf session on saturday			1
it ’s my wave , keep your f * * * * * g eyes open			1
’ to which mr @entity7 , of @entity40 , @entity20 , can be heard responding : ‘ there ’s no need to swear			1
’ however , the unknown @entity14 boarder then shouts : ‘ do n’t tell me not to f * * * * * g swear – you nearly caused me an accident then			1
‘ i was on the wave			2
do n’t do it again			0
do it again and i will put you in f * * * * * g hospital and that ’s a promise			1
‘ do n’t act like a t * * t in the water			1
’ however , despite mr @entity7 apologising , the man continues to hurl abuse and exclaims : ‘ f * * * off back to @entity4 you * * * *			1
’ despite mr @entity7 pointing out that he is in fact from @entity20 , the man – who appears to have a strong @entity62 accent - responds : ‘ i was born here ’			1
mr @entity7 can then be heard telling the man it ‘ gives him no more right ’ but is met by a response of ‘ f * * * off ’ by the @entity14 rider who then paddles off			1
in the video footage , the @entity14 boarder , right , can be heard shouting : ' you drop in on me like that again and you wo n't f * * * * * g surf here again			1
it 's my wave , keep your f * * * * * g eyes open ' the incident , which occurred off @entity77 in @entity40 , @entity20 , has left mr @entity7 ‘ wary of going back into the water ’			1
he said : ‘ i think he ’s bang out of order for the way he spoke to me and the localism he used as well			0
‘ it ’s inappropriate - it should n’t be used in any way , shape or form			2
‘ i ’ve heard he ’s quite renowned for saying these kinds of things to other people in the water			0
i ’ve heard of at least a handful of people saying the same thing has happened to them			0
‘ it ’s disgusting and it ’s just not right			2
‘ it ’s the same as racism			0
it ’s exactly the same thing just in a different manner			0
‘ i am a bit wary to get back in the water now to be honest			0
i think i ’ll go to a different beach now to avoid him			0
’ the former @entity108 serviceman and keen surfer added : ‘ i was quite shocked			1
everyone in @entity20 is pretty laid back – you do n’t get that kind of thing usually so to receive that from him was one hell of a shock			2
‘ i told him i ’m from @entity20 but he comes across as if it is his water and almost as if he classes me as a holidaymaker			1
‘ it should n’t make any difference where i ’m from - it ’s the same water			2
’ the paddle boarder , right , tells longboarder @entity7 , left : ' do n't act like a t * * t in the water			1
f * * * off back to @entity4 you * * * * ' mr @entity7 , who served eight years in the @entity108 working in @entity126 on a battle tank @entity128 – and was deployed to @entity129 – said other locals have also been left shocked by the incident			1
he said : ‘ they all think it ’s disgusting the way he was talking to me			0
there ’s no real reason for anyone to talk to anyone else like that			0
‘ it made me feel horrible and i did n’t appreciate the way he was talking to me			0
‘ i ’ve had suggestions that i should go to the police about it but i do n’t really want to go down the formal line			0
‘ i ’m not spiteful and i do n’t wish the guy harm , i just want him to know i ’m unhappy and i want an apology			0
’ mr @entity7 also said he was left confused by the man ’s comment telling him to ‘ f * * * off back to @entity4 ’ and said there was no need for localism			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t know if he ’s from @entity20 - he has a broad @entity159 accent - but he said at the time “ i was born here ”			1
‘ i do n’t know what his views are but i certainly do n’t think of @entity20 is its own country or anything like that			2
‘ i know there ’s some good old rivalry between @entity168 and @entity20 but that ’s just banter			2
’ @entity7 , left , also said he was left confused by the man 's comment telling him to ' f * * * off back to @entity4 ' and said there was no need for localism @entity7 , centre , said he accidentally caught the same wave as the paddle boarder			1
he said : ' i did n't realise that if someone is closer to the point of the wave breaking then it 's classed as their wave ' it ’s unclear what the @entity14 boarder meant by his racist comment but it appears he holds the view that @entity20 is a separate entity to @entity4 and that it should be classed as a different country			1
despite his strong northern accent , the black and white @entity192 ’s flag can be seen stuck to the front of his paddle board which is used by some @entity197 people as a symbol of identity			0
the view that @entity20 is separate from the rest of @entity4 is a view which is long - held by several people from the county , who regard the ‘ @entity20 ’ as distinctly separate from the rest of the @entity205			1
a minority believe the @entity197 should be considered a separate race or nation , with their own language , society and customs which is distinct from the neighbouring mainland			0
mr @entity7 , who now manages a brewery in the county , said the whole incident was an accident on his part and said he just wants an apology from the @entity14 boarder			2
the incident , which occurred off @entity77 in @entity40 , @entity20 , has left keen surfer @entity7 , pictured , ' wary of going back into the water ' he said : ‘ i started surfing properly last summer and i did n’t realise that if someone is closer to the point of the wave breaking then it ’s classed as their wave			1
‘ what i did was n’t dangerous - there was no one in front of us - so there ’s no reason for him to have said it would ’ve created an accident			0
‘ i ’ve never seen the guy before in my life , let alone surfed with him before , but there was such a distance between us that it should n’t have been a problem			0
‘ apparently i was in the wrong but after the wave he seemed quite happy at first until he paddled across to me and had a right bl * * dy go at me			1
‘ but to be honest i just want an apology and to shake the guys hand and move on			0
’ the @entity18 is the @entity197 flag and is attributed to @entity192 - a 6th @entity249 abbot @entity18 is the flag of @entity20			2
it is a white cross on a black background and is used by some @entity197 people as a symbol of identity			0
it can be found raised outside many homes in @entity20 as well as on car bumper stickers , bunting , t - shirts and tax disc holders			2
the flag is attributed to @entity192 - a 6th century @entity197 abbot and saint			0
one early use of the white cross and black background design was the 15th century coat of arms of the @entity268 family			0
the earliest known description of the flag was written in 1835			0
at the @entity272 in june 2012 , the flag was among those flown on the @entity274 , @entity275			0
@entity276 - the national day of @entity20 - falls on march 5 annually and is celebrated in the county most notably with parades and processions , ceremonies of raising the flag , shop decorations and family entertainment			2
in 2006 @entity197 mp @entity284 asked the government to make march 5 a public holiday in @entity20 to recognise @entity276 celebrations			2
since then , several employers mark the day by giving their staff a day off to honour ‘ @entity290 ’ .			0
