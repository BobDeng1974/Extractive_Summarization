@entity0 has warned @entity1 to keep pace with @entity4 ’s rapid rise or the @entity6 striker might one day be too big for the club			1
on the eve of taking @entity9 to @entity10 , @entity0 insisted his former club must improve at a similar rate or risk losing their academy star			2
@entity4 was handed his first @entity15 start for @entity1 by @entity0 12 months ago and has taken the top - flight by storm this season , scoring 29 goals in all competitions			1
he penned a new five - and - a - half year contract at @entity1 in february before scoring 78 seconds into his @entity6 debut last month			1

‘ he ’d be a commodity now for the club , he has earned that right through his performances this season			0
‘ he needs to continue to do that for a number of seasons and perhaps he will be outgrowing that football club			0
‘ not at the moment , he has a long way to go before he outgrows a club the size of @entity1			2
for their sake they need to keep hold of him			0
‘ i have communicated with him since i ’ve left , just to wish him well when he ’s played for @entity6 and congratulate him on his call - ups			2
’ @entity0 joked that he would be the first to try to tempt @entity4 away from @entity1 by bidding in the summer but said the form of @entity27 and @entity52 would keep out the 21 - year - old			1
‘ with @entity27 banging the goals in and @entity52 playing like he is i have n’t got room for @entity4 ! ’ he laughed			1
@entity27 has scored seven goals in his last five games and has a decision to make on his future once the season is over			1
two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to get a move to @entity1 and @entity0 admitted there was interest			2
he said it would be his dream to partner @entity27 and @entity4 together			2
‘ i ’d want them both , ’ he said when asked which striker he would choose			0
@entity0 also praised the form of @entity27 's strike partner , @entity52 ( right ) @entity0 believes @entity27 's upturn in form is a result of improved service for the @entity75 striker @entity27 will look to continue his scoring form for @entity9 when they take on @entity1 and @entity4 on saturday @entity0 said @entity27 ’s improved form , having only scored three times before @entity9 sacked @entity80 , was down to the medicine of greater service			1
‘ do you think he was starved of service ? it ’s like a little bit of medicine			0
if people keep throwing it down your throat all of a sudden you feel better and you feel more about yourself and that ’s where i think he is now			0
‘ he knows if he gets chances he ’ll score			0
he ’s just proved that			0
he ’s a prolific goalscorer , he ’s a one in two striker			0
