president @entity1 's hope of any movement on immigration reform in @entity4 died tuesday night when @entity6 majority leader @entity5 lost his @entity8 primary election			1
@entity10 will resign his leadership post as of july 31 , sources said wednesday			1
and with him out he way out , the @entity8 's future @entity6 leadership picture has been thrown into chaos			1
while political commentators and @entity16 insiders have crowed that the populist right - wing tea party movement was on its last legs , the rumors of its death now appear to be greatly exaggerated			1
not so , however , for the prospects of passing an immigration reform measure into law			2
@entity25 voters dug a grave for the idea on tuesday night and kicked @entity28 into it			0
@entity5 's appetite to inherit the gavel from @entity6 speaker @entity32 was an open secret on @entity34 , and rumors have swirled about @entity32 's desire to step down from that role			1
but with the seven - term congressman 's unexpected loss to @entity41 , an economics professor so obscure that his @entity43 entry was just two lines long on monday , the @entity6 leadership sweepstakes is wide open			1
rep. @entity66 , the @entity67 chairman of the @entity68 , said wednesday that he is ' prayerfully ' considering whether to run for @entity5 's job inside the @entity8 caucus			1
' i am humbled by the many people who have approached me about serving our @entity73 in a different capacity in the future , ' @entity66 told @entity77 in a statement			0
' there are many ways to advance the causes of freedom and free enterprise , and i am prayerfully considering the best way i can serve in those efforts			0
' @entity86 , another @entity67 @entity8 seen in tea party circles as far more moderate , is also considering a run			2
if @entity32 should relinquish the speaker 's gavel , @entity89 @entity8 rep. @entity8 will be the front - runner , according to several @entity6 staffers with knowledge of discussions in the @entity8 caucus			1
@entity5 lost , in part , because he backed modest reforms to @entity100 's immigration policies			1
but his political - neophyte opponent , economics professor @entity41 , painted him as an high octane @entity1 - style ' amnesty ' advocate			1
@entity5 's zeal – and @entity1 's – to flood the @entity105 with cheap labor from @entity107 and @entity100 , @entity41 argued throughout the campaign , would depress wages for people in the district that stretches northwest from the state capitol of @entity113			1
the tactic worked far better than any political observers predicted			0
and now the @entity117 's hope of congressional action on immigration this year is all but dead			2
@entity1 told a group of nurses on monday			0
@entity122 , a 31 - year - old registered nurse , told the @entity123 that the president said there was a 50 - 50 chance that the @entity6 would take action on immigration in the next month			1
but politicos in @entity130 were writing off any hope of that on wednesday morning			0
' i think that was probably true prior to last night , ' one source who is close to the @entity8 leadership told @entity137 of @entity1 's prediction			1
' and now i think that the odds of that happening are very , very low			0
' another said in an email that ' immigration reform was never very likely anyway , but this was probably the [ final ] nail in the coffin			2
' no longer heir - apparent : @entity5 ( r ) was expected to inherit the speaker 's gavel from @entity32 ( @entity148 ) if the @entity149 decided to step down from the most powerful role in the @entity6 immigration in the spotlight : tens of thousands of @entity100 children have snuck into the @entity105 this year without their parents , a crisis that has changed immigration reform from a political bargaining chip into a front - burner issue @entity5 would have been the majority leader in the @entity6 until january had he not resigned earlier today			1
a @entity34 insider with close ties to the leadership office told @entity137 that @entity5 suddenly ' lost a lot of power ' after last night 's defeat , which would have made it hard for him to continue in a leadership role			2
' my gosh , how is he going to get anyone to vote for this now ? ' the insider said , referring to immigration reform			2
a third source , a senior aide to a @entity8 senator , told @entity137 on wednesday that @entity8 leaders on that side of the @entity34 are ' actually relieved			0
' @entity28 passed @entity1 's preferred immigration bill in june 2013 with the help of 14 more moderate @entity8 , but it ' left a sour taste in the conservative wing 's mouth , ' he said			1
' now everyone gets to take a deep breath , knowing that the whole thing is dead in the @entity6			0
until @entity5 lost , that was an open question			2
' the @entity28 bill would give green cards – work permits – to illegal immigrants and start them on a lengthy 13 - year path to citizenship			2
but that would only happen after the government deploys 20,000 additional border agents , mandates a system to prevent businesses from hiring unauthorized people and finishes a new 700 - mile fence on the southern border			0
@entity28 @entity28 are still hoping against hope that the legislation could get a hearing in the @entity6			0
they 're painting @entity5 as an opponent of immigration reform , not as one of its champions – which is the image that earned him a crushing double - digit defeat on tuesday			1
@entity215 sen. @entity214 called @entity5 the ' last major obstacle to immigration reform ' on wednesday , and warned on the @entity28 floor that the @entity8 will lose control of the @entity6 if it does n't come to heel			1
that possibility is near zero , however : the @entity8 is set to gain seats in november , and possibly retake the @entity28 from @entity214 and his fellow @entity28			0
@entity5 's district spanned urban @entity113 and rural counties , areas where unemployment runs high and @entity41 was able to argue that increased immigration would make jobs more scarce and depress wages @entity28 left - wingers did have one reason to be hopeful on tuesday , however : @entity232 @entity231 sen. @entity231 , who has earned the moniker ' @entity231 - nesty ' for his support of some immigration reform planks , won his primary contest easily			1
but that was in a statewide race , a broader kind of contest that usually mutes the impact of the sort of grassroots organizers who doomed @entity5 in his smaller district			1
' @entity5 's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the @entity8 establishment , ' conservative icon @entity245 said			2
' the grassroots is in revolt and marching			0
' @entity245 is chairman of @entity245 , an organization that has targeted moderate @entity8 , including @entity5 , and promoted more conservative candidates who are often @entity254 darlings			2
still , the @entity117 is casting @entity231 's victory as a sign that immigration reform advocates will ultimately have the upper hand in @entity4			2
' @entity5 ’s problem was n't his position on immigration reform , ' tweeter @entity1 senior aide @entity262			1
' it was his lack of a position			0
@entity231 wrote and passed a bill and is winning big			0
' speaker @entity32 has never tipped his hand on the substance of immigration reform proposals , but he has said he favored holding a vote on the issue and mocked his fellow republicans for their reluctance			1
' here 's the attitude : " ohhhh			0
do n't make me do this			0
this is too hard " , ' @entity32 told reporters in april , doing an impression of his congressional caucus while squealing like a child			0
' we get elected to make choices			0
we get elected to solve problems and it 's remarkable to me how many of my colleagues ... take the path of least resistance , ' @entity32 continued			0
@entity32 has since reiterated that @entity1 's ' all or nothing ' approach to immigration is off the table			1
@entity41 , right , defeated @entity6 majority leader @entity5 in the @entity8 primary on tuesday , marking one of the most improbable @entity105 political victories in the history of party primaries in addition to the ' amnesty ' albatross aroudn his neck , @entity5 shot himself in the foot by ignoring the ordinary needs of his constituents , according to two @entity307 officials who spoke to @entity137			1
' he just was n't around anymore , not since he took a leadership role in the @entity6 , ' said one , jumping on the bash - @entity5 bandwagon			2
' he turned into a jet - setter , when what we needed was a handyman to fix normal stuff that middle - class people care about			0
' playbook , the influential daily email service from @entity320 , noted a gossiped reaction of another knowledgeable insider : ' @entity5 spent too much time on the road and in the @entity325			0
' he also whiled away his afternoons in the @entity328 lobbying corridor , according to @entity330 editor @entity329			0
' @entity5 's constituent services moved more toward focusing on running the @entity8 @entity6 majority than his congressional district , ' @entity329 wrote			1
' @entity328 , the den of @entity130 lobbyists , became his chief constituency			0
... he kept his attention off his district , constituents , and conservatives while he and his staff plotted to get the speaker ’s chair			0

@entity6 @entity8 calls *emergency* meeting for *4pm* wednesday to plot future without @entity5
@entity5 will resign his leadership position as majority leader in the @entity6 on july 31
immigration reform doomed @entity5 , the second most powerful @entity6 @entity8 , along with a lack of attention to his district 's voters
@entity5 lost in a 56 - 44 drubbing to @entity41 , an economics professor who was so unknown that his @entity43 entry was just two lines long
the *stunning* upset has restored conservatives ' hope in the tea party movement , which seemed on the wane
it 's *unclear* who will take @entity5 's place as @entity8 leader in the @entity371 ; at least three *contenders* are already testing the *waters*
@entity32 could also step down from his role as @entity6 speaker , a job that would have been @entity5 's for the taking
@entity5 favored limited movement on immigration reform , including a proposal that awarded a path to citizenship in exchange for *military* service
but @entity41 painted him as a full - blown ' amnesty ' supporter , and *anti-immigration* conservatives see the race as a *bellwether* on the issue
sources say all hope is gone now for an immigration reform law this year , despite president @entity1 's prediction on monday of a 50 - 50 chance
