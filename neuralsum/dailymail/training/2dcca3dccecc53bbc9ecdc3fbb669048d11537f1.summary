by @entity0 you 've heard of flash mobs ? behold the @entity4 mob			1
playing off the idea of using social media to summon crowds for parties or mischief , mobs of @entity8 - area @entity6 have been filling pews and lifting spirits at some of the city 's original , now often sparsely attended , churches			1
it works this way : on a given sunday , participants attend @entity22 at a church they 've picked in an online vote and promoted through @entity25 and @entity26			2
visitors experience the architecture , heritage and spirit of the aging houses of worship and the churches once again see the numbers they were built for , along with a helpful bump in donations when the collection baskets are passed			2
people gathered for mass inside @entity40 in @entity8 as part of ' @entity42 ' ' i call these churches faith enhancers			1
you ca n't help but walk in and feel closer to a higher power , ' said @entity47 , who hatched the idea in @entity8 last fall and has organized two @entity4 mobs so far , both of which drew hundreds			1
he 's heard from other cities about starting their own			0
the aim , he said , is to reignite interest , support and perhaps even membership in older churches that ' kind of fall off the radar screen of people			1
' one such church is @entity63 in a neighborhood settled by @entity66 immigrants along the @entity67			1
the church once brimmed with 800 families when it was dedicated in 1900			2
today , fewer than 50 worshippers typically amble into the @entity72 - style sanctuary for sunday @entity73 it 's a familiar story among city churches that were built for waves of @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity66 and @entity80 immigrants but whose congregations have dwindled with the city 's population decline and suburban sprawl			1
@entity8 's population is less than half what it was in 1950 , when it peaked at 580,000			2
' we 're still here , ' said the rev. @entity91 , who welcomed a crowd of more than 300 on a recent sunday after @entity63 , known to locals as ' pets , ' was selected for the @entity4 mob			1
head mobster : @entity47 organizes the @entity97 in @entity8 organizers sought nominations from the public for churches on the @entity4 mob website and put the top three up for a vote			1
online voting begins this week for the next mob , planned for march 23			0
' it 's wonderful , ' said @entity91 , who learned his church had been chosen two weeks before			0
' it just shows that we are not just one parish , that it 's the whole family of the diocese			0
we take care of each other			0
' and , ' he added , ' if it helps us pay a few more bills ... ' with every pew occupied , later - arriving worshippers stood against the back wall , reminding 88 - year - old parishioner @entity120 of the way it used to be in the church she has attended since birth , a block from her lifelong home			0
' you had to get here very early when i was young , it was so crowded , ' she said			0
' and now there are just a handful			0
it 's hard to accept , but you have to			0
' during the sign of peace , @entity91 spent several minutes breezing up and down aisles , smiling and shaking hands			0
he invited all to a nearby community center for a pastry and coffee after the service			0
several visitors arrived at the church with cameras , aiming them at brilliant stained - glass windows imported from @entity148 , the church 's pride and joy , and the ornate marble altar , the likes of which are seldom seen in the more modern suburban churches built today			2
our lady of perpetual help in @entity8 where the last mass mob met up to pray " it 's wonderful to see the old churches			1
they 're beautiful , " said @entity160 , who came from nearby @entity161 to be part of the mob			0
while the sanctuary is largely well - preserved , areas of cracking plaster and water stains show a need for costly maintenance			0
" seeing the community together and caring about them , i was really happy to hear about it , " @entity160 said			0
@entity173 of the suburb of @entity175 hoped the @entity4 mob idea would bring more young people back to church so that crowds would again be the rule , not the exception			1
the eight - county @entity182 of @entity8 , in a restructuring , has closed nearly 100 churches in recent years as attendance and financial support has declined and priests have retired			1
days after the @entity4 mob came an announcement that 10 suburban catholic schools would close after this school year			2
@entity47 , 46 , plans about six @entity4 mobs a year			1
@entity194 and @entity195 made the 90 - minute trip from @entity197 and are already promoting the idea in their city , where they blog about @entity204 's religious and spiritual history and sites			0
@entity47 , an activist in the @entity208 - @entity207 neighborhood where he grew up , said there has been interest from other cities , too , and he hopes the flash mob social media hook will resonate with a younger generation for whom the pull of family tradition has relaxed			1
said @entity47 , ' they may think it 's cool '			2

playing off the idea of using social media to summon crowds for parties or mischief , @entity42 uses social media to get people to attend churches
