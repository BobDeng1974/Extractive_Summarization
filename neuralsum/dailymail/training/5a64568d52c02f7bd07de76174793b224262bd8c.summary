by @entity0 i am not a fit man			0
this is the thought that goes barrelling around my head as i lay my mountain bike against a pineapple bush , and slump against the bark of a mango tree			0
i lean back , and survey the sweeping , verdant panorama of the plantation fields before me			0
it is only the second day of my attempt to traverse @entity15 by muscle power			1
and while the scenery is spectacular , it turns out that my lung capacity is not			2
can a view still be breathtaking when you do n't have the breath to take it in , i wonder ? success , in spite of it all : @entity0 celebrates as he reaches the @entity26 of @entity15 - after a week of pain how did i get here ? well firstly , by following the crowd			1
adventure travel holidays are on the rise			2
the market has grown at 65 per cent a year since 2009 , according to the @entity32			0
with such statistics , surely anyone can climb onto a bike , or up a mountain , or down a glacier , right ? right ? throwing caution ( and common sense ) to the wind , i decide to book myself onto a trip that offers the opportunity to ' @entity43 ' - through by bike and raft alone			2
now , if you are going to ' conquer ' any country - in terms of crossing it , rather than anything , you know , military - @entity15 is an excellent choice			1
it may comprise only 0.1 per cent of the world 's landmass , but it boasts five per cent of its biodiversity , with scenery varying from sub-alpine dwarf vegetation to unspoiled rainforest , coastlines of white sand , and arid , dusty farmland			1
add in a wildlife checklist to make even @entity66 jealous ( jaguars , monkeys , toucans , parrots , green sea turtles and roughly 850 species of birds ) , and it is a must - see for any traveller			1
taking a well - deserved breather : @entity0 enjoys a moment of respite during his marathon cross-country ride working on the presumption that you never forget how to ride a bike , and that i have previously cycled 40 miles over two days through undulating @entity83 countryside ( with multiple prosecco - and pizza - stops along the way ) , i set off to @entity15 with a whopping two hours of gym training under my belt			1
it is a fearsome preparation regime that pays off wonderfully for the first two days , as our group glides down the gorgeous @entity91 on rafts - with nothing but the occasional splash - inducing rapid , blue butterfly kerfuffle or waterfall ascent ( and subsequent leap down ) to break up the day			2
but the next leg of our trip - a 300 - mile bike ride from the @entity101 to the @entity26 , west across the torso of the country - will not turn out to be quite as gentle			1
after a short drive , we unload our bikes on the edge of the @entity107 , just a few hundred metres from where @entity108 anchored in 1502			1
it is an inspiring start , and with a belly full of the local gallo pinto ( rice and beans ) fuelling our calves , we set off on a 32 - mile day ride			2
a sight to soothe the soul : @entity15 deals in spectacular scenery - and glorious sunsets the route takes in beachside trundles under coconut trees , with howler monkeys and sloths alternately wailing and unfurling in the rainforest overhead			1
we play games of cardiovascular hopscotch across train tracks with bikes in tow , and eat a native cascado lunch ( meat , salad , rice and beans ) in a locals - only hangout			2
we chart a heady route through working banana plantations ( and enjoy a fascinating introduction to fruit - picking , courtesy of our local guides and those working in the fields )			0
predictably ( or hilariously , depending on your viewpoint ) , things did not stay quite as sedate			0
while meteorologists may praise @entity15 for its ' perfect ' tropical climate , conditions feel less than ideal when you are cycling in 36 ° c heat			1
are you sure this was a good idea ? @entity0 did little training ahead of his epic ride - but survived throw in numerous boat crossings ( some across crocodile - infested waters ) , groin - destroying mega-rides ( 80 miles with multiple off - road stretches , and with a volcano - scaling finale ) and i - for one - am not laughing ( i do not have the energy )			1
add in the occasional over-the - handlebars face - plant , and each day becomes a true challenge			0
not only of fitness , but of mental fortitude			0
of course , the whole incredible journey brings with it timeless memories : endorphine - soaring stretches alongside stunningly beautiful azure lakes , and speedy blitzes through dazzling limestone quarries			2
muscle - soothing soaks in natural hot springs at the foot of volcanoes , and lazy lunches relaxing in the shade of mango trees			0
and , best of all , the final , ecstatic joy of cracking open a bottle of champagne while gazing at the @entity187 , after 300 miles of hard - fought exertion			1
the real joy of adventure travel is the sobering gift of perspective			0
sure , i may not be as fit or prepared as i should be			0
but when your biggest concern is how many bewilderingly gorgeous mountains you have to summit in a single day , aching legs and a few thousand beads of sweat are a small price			0
@entity202 ( 01604 7312442 ; www.bikehike.com ) offers a 13 - day ' ride to @entity43 ' tour			0
this includes two days of whitewater rafting on the @entity91 , and seven days of biking from the @entity101 to the @entity26 ( a distance of 300 miles )			1
the tour costs from £ 1799 per person , and includes accommodation , most meals , @entity213 , rafting gear , camping gear , all internal transportation , airport transfers , guides and driver .			0
