by @entity0 published : 20:45 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 21:44 est , 6 september 2013 reluctant dieters often dream of being able to eat whatever they want at dinner without gaining weight			1
now one health writer claims he can make the dream a reality – but only by imposing a strict vegan diet during the day			1
@entity9 has gained thousands of followers in the @entity11 with his @entity13 diet , which stands for @entity14 before 6pm			1
virtue : a new diet encourages people to eat only vegan food during the daytime in order to lose weight eat only vegetables all day , he says , and the kitchen ’s your oyster come sunset			1
whether you crave steak , a cheeseburger or a rich chocolate mousse , nothing is barred as long as it is eaten in moderation			0
mr @entity9 , 63 , claims it helped him lose 15 per cent of his body weight and saved him from developing diabetes			1
now the craze is taking off in the @entity35 after his best - selling book was published here this summer			0
vegans eat no animal products , basing their meals on healthy fruit , vegetables and grains , which are high in fibre and nutrients			1
reward : the plan allows dieters to chow down on meat after six o'clock every evening mr @entity9 describes his ‘ flexitarian ’ – or semi-vegetarian – plan as a compromise for those who want to be healthy but ca n’t face giving up the animal foods they love , which are often high in saturated fat			1
the author , a food writer for 30 years , adopted the diet seven years ago after doctors said he was pre-diabetic			1
with high cholesterol and blood sugar , he was told to cut out unhealthy foods or go on medication			0
@entity63 : @entity9 says his diet will revolutionise people 's health and lifestyles he said : ‘ it was the best compromise i could come up with between an all - plant diet and eating the way i was eating			1
‘ the strategy is common sense			0
if there ’s one or two things that science has found in the last few decades , it ’s eat more plants and less junk – this is one way of doing that			0
’ mr @entity9 said it helped him lose 1st in a month and 1st 7lb in the next few months			1
his book , with 60 vegan recipes for lunch and breakfast , topped the @entity85 bestseller book list in the @entity11			0
unlike other diets , which promise fast results , he emphasises it is not a ‘ quick - fix ’ option			0
he said : ‘ this is a life - long plan			2
you do n’t just do it for three months and give it up			2
it ’s about eating in a way that ’s better for you			0
many people are overweight and are eating way too much meat and this is a strategy for changing that			2
’ eating less saturated fat can reduce the risk of obesity , heart disease and diabetes			0
but @entity104 , lecturer in nutrition at @entity106 , said : ‘ it is true that vegans lose weight			2
‘ but there ’s a slight problem in eating animal products in the evening			0
it makes more sense to have a big breakfast with eggs and bacon and then go down to vegetables for lunch and dinner			0
breakfast is very important as your body needs a kick - start at the beginning of the day			2

@entity9 says his diet allowed him to shed 15 *%* of his body weight
plan gives *flexibility* to those who want to stay healthy but ca *n't* give up meat
