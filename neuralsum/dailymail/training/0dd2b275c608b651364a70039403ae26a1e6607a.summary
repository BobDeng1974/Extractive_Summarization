by @entity0 published : 08:34 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 08:36 est , 25 february 2013 the number of women in positions of power in the @entity6 has plummeted causing a damaging effects on our country 's social , cultural and political life , an influential new report has claimed today			1
researchers found female representation at senior levels of the judiciary , education , the arts , finance , the civil service and @entity20 has gone into reverse			1
the evidence is presented in a report by @entity24 , a coalition of five organisations including the @entity26 and the @entity27			1
home secretary @entity28 is one of a dwindling number of women in top jobs , according to a new report in politics , the report finds that @entity6 has rapidly fallen down the international league tables for female democratic representation since @entity37 left power			1
the former @entity40 prime minister had eight female cabinet ministers and there were 31 women in government			1
women now make up only 22.5 per cent of @entity46 ; 12.3 per cent of council leaders ( in @entity49 ) ; and 17.4 per cent of the cabinet , the report says			1
the study found @entity6 fell 37 places through the noughties , from 33rd place in 2001 , to joint 60th in 2010			1
in western governments , only @entity56 and @entity57 had fewer female representatives in 2010			1
the @entity60 and @entity61 : who runs @entity6 ? report , to be published tomorrow , found a similar trend at senior levels in the judiciary , education , the arts , finance , the civil service , the @entity71 and media			1
the group was created after the 2010 general election to create annual reports modelled on the audits of public life that were published by the now defunct @entity78			2
women are increasingly under - represented in the judiciary , according to @entity24 @entity81 , director of the @entity82 said : ' this report shows a shocking absence of women from powerful roles in @entity6			1
' we are often told that it 's just a matter of time before we have equality , but we have already waited for generations ; asking us to wait still more will change nothing , and the quality of decision - making in our democracy and public life will suffer as a result			0
' there needs to be meaningful action now if next year 's report is to show real progress			2
' only a third of public appointments are female , as are 15.6 per cent of high court judges and five per cent of editors of national daily newspapers			2
in many areas , progress has shifted into reverse , such as in the devolved regional political bodies , where fewer women have been returned at recent elections			2
@entity113 , chief executive of the @entity114 said : ' these missing women offer the most vivid illustration of parliament 's failure to keep up with the times			0
while women are well represented in the teaching profession , the report says they are not at the upper echelons of the education sector ' politicians will struggle to connect with voters as long as the combined talents and perspectives of half the population are shut out			1
party leaders admit there 's a problem , but all have failed to find a lasting solution			0
' it 's not a good look for the mother of all @entity138 to be left lagging behind on the fundamental issue of women 's representation			0
' in @entity144 , the percentage of women elected has dropped from 50 per cent in 2004 to 40 per cent last year ; in @entity146 , the figure has dropped from 39.5 per cent to 34.9 per cent in the same time			0
in a handful of other areas , progress has been made in the past decade , but with a long way still to go			0
women now lead three in ten trade unions and membership is 50 - 50			0
@entity154 , chief executive of the @entity26 , said : ' it 's simply scandalous fact that in 2013 men still outnumber women four to one in parliament			0
if political parties do n't take urgent action , @entity6 will continue to fall down the global league table when it comes to women 's access to power and representation in politics			2
' the number of women in the @entity171 is at a ten year low			0
failure to increase the number of women around the top table of politics sends a message to other walks of life and to the next generation for whom we hope for something different , that excluding women from positions of power is acceptable			2
' women 's votes will determine the next election â€“ remaining male dominated wo n't help the parties on polling day ' @entity191 , chief executive of the @entity27 said : ' @entity192 needs to show leadership in reflecting the people it governs and serves			0
' decisions made in @entity192 affect women and men equally and the dearth of women in positions of political power not only reflects badly on the quality of our democracy , it also wastes the skill , expertise and life experience of half the population and sets a terrible example for other professions and industries			0
' it 's time for @entity192 and political parties to take concrete steps to increase the number of women in politics			2
' @entity220 , deputy director of @entity221 , said : ' the lack of female involvement in @entity6 politics is a canary in the mining shaft ; it is a particularly visible example of how the system fails to represent people more widely			1
' our democracy and public life is weaker because it misses the skills experience and talents of over half the population			0
it is not enough to recognise the problem and simply hope that things will improve ; we need @entity192 and politicians to take urgent action			0
