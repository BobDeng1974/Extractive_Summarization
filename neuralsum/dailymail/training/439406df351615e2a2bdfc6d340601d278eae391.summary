by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 20:39 est , 2 march 2013 @entity1 kissing @entity2 in @entity3 @entity3 star @entity1 was twice deemed unsuitable for a damehood – with her fragile mental health and scandalous affairs possible reasons for the snub			1
two unidentified experts who were asked to consider @entity1 ’s suitability vetoed the honour when she was twice considered in 1952 and 1954			1
they deemed the actress – who had fallen for sir @entity14 when married , and also had an affair with actor @entity16 – suitable only for a lower - ranking @entity17			1
in the end she was not honoured at all			1
the comments are revealed in @entity21 papers obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws			2
it is not clear whether the individuals quoted were civil servants , politicians or other experts consulted as part of the honours process			1
one of the pair writes : ‘ there are contrary opinions about her merits as an actress			2
' personally i think she is underrated , and see no reason why she should not have a @entity17 [ commander of the @entity41 ] but certainly not a @entity17 [ @entity40 of the @entity41 ]			1
’ the other wrote : ‘ i am a great admirer of @entity1 as an actress both stage and film			1
‘ apart from her gifts as an actress , she has won great public admiration for the courage with which she has in recent years faced illness			2
‘ personally i doubt whether she is at present quite what may be called “ @entity53 ” , eg @entity54 , @entity56			1
i , therefore , venture to express the view that @entity17 appears to be more appropriate than @entity17			1
’ the star was 39 at the time of the first snub and was enjoying huge international acclaim for her performances in the film and stage versions of the @entity68 classic @entity67			2
but she had suffered from lifelong depression and had previously taken an overdose on the set of @entity3 in 1938 – the film in which @entity2 as @entity73 famously told her : ‘ frankly , my dear , i do n’t give a damn			2
’ in 1953 she went on to suffer a complete mental breakdown after having an affair with co-star @entity78 while filming @entity79			2
she was replaced in her role by @entity81 and admitted to a psychiatric hospital			2
@entity1 curtseys to the @entity83 at the @entity84 in 1954 next to husband sir @entity14 and @entity85 @entity1 ’s biographer @entity86 believes that legendary actor @entity14 could have been behind at least one snub			1
he said : ‘ i think it quite possible that she was turned down because she was too beautiful and too feminine			0
she clearly did n’t fit the idea of a theatrical dame at that time			0
‘ but these individuals would have been aware that she had health problems and that she had been married twice			0
clearly these things still mattered in the @entity96			0
' i just wonder if @entity14 himself had any input into the matter , because he was such a powerful figure in the theatre world			0
' he was jealous of her always and so beastly to her basically that he could easily have said , “ i do n’t think she would want such a thing			0
” ’ mr @entity86 said it is unlikely the actress , who was married to @entity14 from 1940 to 1960 , would have been aware of or bothered by the snub			0
the newly released papers also show that the @entity17 bestowed on @entity112 author @entity111 was delayed for a year because officials sent a letter informing him of the honour to the wrong address			1
and actor @entity117 was knighted in 1992 only because his career was almost over and that the honour was ‘ overdue ’			0
a @entity121 memo dated july 12 , 1965 , and headed honours – in @entity123 states : ‘ @entity111 will presumably remain on the list for consideration and should , in my view , automatically , go into the next list : it can hardly be held against him that we were not able to deliver the letter offering his @entity17 in the birthday [ honours ] list			1
’ @entity1 fell for @entity14 , left , when she was already married - and cheated on @entity14 with @entity16 , right of @entity117 ’s , one official notes the actor ‘ is described by the @entity139 as a legendary talent , he is now close to the end of his acting career			1
an honour is overdue ’			0
the papers show that political affiliations appear regularly to have influenced decision - making behind honours			0
@entity147 prime minister @entity146 blocked a cbe for the right - wing author @entity148 in the 1979 @entity149			0
a @entity121 minute dated november 20 , 1978 , reads : ‘ the prime minister has given consideration to his recommendations for the @entity152 1979			0
the prime minister does not wish to include @entity148			0
’ @entity148 was later knighted in 1990 when @entity154 @entity153 was prime minister .			0

@entity1 was considered for a damehood in 1952 and 1954
experts considered her suitable for only a @entity17 not the ' @entity53 '
@entity1 , who died in 1967 , was not honoured at all in the end
