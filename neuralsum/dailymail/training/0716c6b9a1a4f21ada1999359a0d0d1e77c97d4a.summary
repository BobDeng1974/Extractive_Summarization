this teenager is lucky to be alive after he was impaled on a tree branch			1
had the branch pierced his stomach just one millimetre the other way , he would have bled to death or be paralysed , doctors said			1
@entity7 , 13 , slipped while climbing a tree and a branch pierced his bowel in a neighbour ’s garden in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15			1
lucky to be alive : @entity7 , 13 , made a lucky escape after this tree branch impaled his stomach and burst his bowel when he slipped while climbing the tree bleeding profusely , he was rushed to hospital for a three and a half hour operation which saved his life			1
he is now fitted with an external stoma bag while his bowel recovers			1
his father @entity23 , 44 , said : ‘ it was n’t until afterwards that the surgeon explained if the tree had been one millimetre to the left he would have bled to death			2
‘ if it had went a millimetre the other way he would have been in a wheelchair for the rest of his life			2
‘ it was a very lucky escape			0
hopefully the bowel will repair itself and at the end he will only have a big scar from his naval up to his chest			0
’ life - saving surgery : had the branch pierced his stomach one millimetre the other way , @entity7 could have bled to death or paralysed			1
instead , he now has an external stoma bag while his bowel recovers miraculously , the branch shot straight back out of @entity7 ’s stomach so none of it was still in his body as he was taken to @entity49 in @entity50 on july 20			1
mr @entity7 , a joiner , said @entity7 had been playing with other children and jumped off a railing onto the fir tree			2
he said : ‘ it was a million - in - one chance as he must have been at the right angle to go straight down and crush the top of the tree			0
‘ we reckon if it had been my younger son he would n’t be here , as when @entity7 landed his legs were just at the right height to touch the ground			0
brave boy : @entity7 gave his parents @entity23 and @entity67 ( pictured ) a real scare but he has hardly shed a tear according to his father ‘ he fell forward and the tree sprang back out , it burst his bowel but they never found any part of the tree in his body			1
‘ they took him to @entity50 to get prepped for going to @entity77 but they had to operate immediately			0
’ he spent seven days in hospital after the operation and now must use the stoma bag for six months while his bowel heals			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ i ca n’t praise my son enough , he ’s hardly shed a tear			0
‘ i ca n’t thank the people at @entity49 enough as well , they were just amazing			0
’ the offending tree has been cut down .			0
