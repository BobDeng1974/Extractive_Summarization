@entity1 's autobiography was launched on monday and the former @entity3 cricketer has certainly divided opinion with his revelations			1
here , @entity7 experts @entity8 , sir @entity9 and @entity10 deliver their own verdicts on @entity1			1
@entity1 launched his autobiography on monday morning and here 's @entity7 's experts ' verdicts @entity8 what we are hearing from @entity1 all comes from @entity3 losing 5 - 0 in @entity18			1
you never learn about divisions in the camp when a team is winning			1
the concept of team spirit makes me laugh			2
@entity26 will tell you that some of the great @entity29 players did not get on and @entity30 will say the same about his great @entity18 side but what they all had was respect for one another when they stepped onto the field			2
somewhere along the line that respect between @entity1 and other @entity3 players and coaches has been lost			1
it makes fascinating reading , @entity1 is entitled to his views and makes some valid points			1
but the methods employed by @entity44 that he condemns took @entity3 to the top of the world rankings and three @entity49 triumphs			1
@entity7 's @entity8 ( left ) speaks with @entity1 ( right ) in 2012 at @entity50 in @entity51 @entity1 , with @entity52 at the time , gestures as he speaks to former @entity3 captain and @entity7 's @entity8 click here for @entity7 's exclusive ! there is a fine line between bullying and banter			1
i have always found the way @entity3 ’s bowlers respond to misfields as unedifying but i ’m sure they will tell you that they set high standards and challenge each other in this way			2
and if what we hear about @entity1 ’s attitude towards @entity74 at @entity75 in 2012 , which @entity1 touches on in the book , is true then maybe that borders on the kind of ‘ bullying ’ he now condemns so strongly			1
perhaps the lesson that needs to be learned from this affair is that @entity79 and @entity80 need to keep an eye on the culture within the dressing room so that , if they gain success with a new @entity3 team , it does not all collapse around them because of a spectacular clash of egos			2
@entity1 , whose autobiography was launched on monday , holds his head as he speaks to @entity8 in 2012 @entity9 i like @entity1 , he ’s the kind of athlete i ’d want in my team			1
but i ca n’t get on board with books of this nature			2
as a fan i ’m saddened , and as a coach i just ca n’t believe it ’s all got so out of hand			1
it just enforces my belief that unless you get it right off the field you have no chance on the field			2
@entity111 sport is a tough place and conflicts are natural behind the scenes			2
our @entity3 team was at its best when a bit of sulphur was in the air , it ’s important to speak out			2
@entity1 stands and chats with coach @entity44 ( right ) during a nets session at @entity123 in 2013 that said , the personal resentment and vilifying @entity1 ’s book exposes is not a problem any team i ’ve been a part of has had to deal with			1
our team had a set of @entity132 — behaviours we agreed upon together			2
these would cover all manner of issues — many similar to those @entity1 highlights			1
we even agreed never to write anything in a book anyone in the dressing room would take offence to			0
for all the achievements that @entity3 team made they have clearly fallen short in this area , and there ’ll be more to come			0
‘ how do you want to be remembered ? ’ is one of my favourite lines			0
i ca n’t help but wonder how some of these guys would answer this question now			0
@entity1 has exposed various incidents in his autobiography and @entity7 's experts deliver their verdicts @entity10 you can not allow a culture to develop in a dressing room where you have cliques and people getting special treatment			1
so if @entity3 did put their bowlers on a pedestal , that is a huge failing of the management			0
the idea that fielders had to apologise to bowlers if they dropped a catch is really unhealthy			0
walking on eggshells and living in fear of people within your own team is mad			0
people know when they make mistakes , they do n’t have to be told to apologise			0
a big man will do that anyway			0
being scared just means you make more mistakes			0
people need support — not to be screamed at			0
@entity1 has involved stories about his time with @entity3 and @entity7 's experts have their say on it too @entity1 seems to have spent a lot of time questioning and criticising the @entity3 management but doing that in front of everybody undermined them			1
the one time i captained @entity3 , manager @entity192 told me if there were problems , i should raise them with him , not in front of the group			0
@entity1 should have probably done the same			1
the problem with speaking out is that people get fed up and you end up looking the fool			0
if he had n’t been so outspoken , he would still be playing for @entity3			0
he has had a magnificent career			0
now he should move on or the bitterness will eat away at him forever			0
@entity205 blasts former @entity3 ' regime '			0
