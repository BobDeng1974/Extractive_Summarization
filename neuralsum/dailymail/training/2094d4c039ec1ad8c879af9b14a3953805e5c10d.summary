by @entity0 plenty of parents feel guilty when they are just too tired to play with their enthusiastic children			0
but one father has created a robot to take over when he needs to put his feet up			1
@entity7 , 41 , has made a rolling robot that looks like a futuristic football when it is folded up , to keep his three - year old son , @entity11 , occupied for hours			1
@entity21 's @entity20 is a prototype developed by its @entity23 ( @entity24 ) which is imagined as a new way of exploring planets			2
a ' @entity28 ' robot , originally developed by @entity29 , has two cameras protruding from it and is now sold as a commercial surveillance solution			2
the ball has a fixed axis and also has built in sensors , microphones and speakers			0
it can travel on sand , snow and mud because of its rugged surface			0
@entity18 is a mobile ball robot that is really a hexapod - with six legs			1
when its legs come together the robot forms a sphere that can roll			2
the @entity50 engineer came up with the idea of building his own robots after his son was given a @entity55 toy as a present just after he was born and he thought : ‘ i can do better than that ’			1
his latest invention is a rolling , spider - like robot that is programmed to keep just ahead of his son as he chases it around			1
@entity18 is a hexapod robot that travels along as a ball			2
when its legs come together the robot forms a sphere that can roll , but it can also scuttle along			2
when curled up as a sphere , the robot can roll fast down hills but can unfurl so that it has six legs upon which to scuttle slowly and delicately along			2
the top of the sphere can open up , which gives the robot the appearance of a lotus flower			0
roll with it : the robot travels fastest as a fully - formed sphere , but can use its feet to propel itself along fairly quickly on a flat surface , and scuttle slowly too all set to scuttle : @entity18 is hexapod as well as a robot that travels along as a ball			1
when its legs come together the robot forms a sphere which can roll , but it can also scuttle delicately along , as pictured here this top part can also be used as more legs so that when both sets are extended , they can be used to propel the robots swiftly along on its side on a flat surface			1
the semi-spherical robot can be steered like this and can also be programmed to evade the clutches of a person chasing it			0
mr @entity7 , who works as a consultant engineer for @entity99 county council in western @entity50 , said building robots is his passion and as far as he knows the ball - shaped @entity18 rolling robot he has made is unique			1
‘ my son is my biggest fan and making the robots for him to play with is a big motivation , ’ he said			2
‘ he really loves them			0
every day he wants one of them unpacked so that he can play with it			0
his favourite is the one i call @entity114 because it looks like an ant			0
’ blooming marvellous : here the robot is fully unfurled and looks a little like a lotus flower			0
its two separate halves can move independently , which enables the robot to be steered as well as swivel when stationary ( pictured ) like a rolling stone : the robot has a complex mechanism beneath its white shell , which means it can tuck its legs into a sphere ( pictured left ) and use them to propel itself along ( right ) and unfurl into a six - legged robot in full bloom : the top of the sphere can open up , which gives the robot the appearance of a lotus flower ( pictured ) while he has received praise for his innovative creations , mr @entity7 said : ‘ i only do it for hobby			1
i just set myself a challenge and then try to rise to it			0
‘ as far as i know i do n't think anyone 's made robots like this so it has unique challenges for me as an engineer			1
‘ it 's the making of it that interests me , although i guess somebody will eventually find an application that it will be useful for			0
’ while his son plays with the original robots , versions have been reproduced and are already being sold in the @entity154 the chase is on : the @entity50 engineer came up with the idea of building his own robots after his son was given a @entity55 toy as a present just after he was born and he thought : ' i can do better than that '			1
here the robot rolls away with a child in pursuit creeping carefully : while he has received praise for his innovative creations , mr @entity7 said : ' i only do it for hobby			1
i just set myself a challenge and then try to rise to it			0
' here , the robot moves along on its six legs			0

the @entity176 spherical robot can walk on six feet and use them to propel itself along on its side too
it is one of engineer @entity7 's many robotic creations which his son plays with in western @entity50
the robots - which *include* an ant - like *critter* - are just a hobby for mr @entity7
