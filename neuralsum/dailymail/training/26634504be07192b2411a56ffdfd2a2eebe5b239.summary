@entity0 made it four straight wins in all competitions with a bonus point success against injury - hit @entity5 at the @entity6			1
two tries from back rowers @entity9 and @entity10 had @entity0 12 - 0 up in as many minutes , with @entity11 replying with a lone penalty before half - time			2
@entity11 had a disappointing night with the boot , though , and man - of - the - match @entity9 's 52nd - minute try coupled with a @entity16 score put @entity0 clear before @entity17 and @entity18 swapped late tries			1
@entity18 ( centre ) is congratulated by his @entity0 team - mates for his try in the 33 - 8 win over @entity5 the only sour point for the hosts was that centre @entity27 's debut only lasted 19 minutes as he picked up a hand injury , while @entity30 lock @entity31 was also forced off in the first half			1
@entity5 made the trip without 20 players , 18 of whom are out injured at present , and were given little hope of claiming their first victory in @entity37 in nine years			0
flanker @entity9 sneaked over for the opening try from close range , catching the @entity5 defence off guard after they had initially done well to halt a third - minute maul			2
@entity44 missed the conversion but was heavily involved , running hard and kicking intelligently to create early attacking opportunities for @entity47 and @entity48			0
the @entity0 out - half opened his account with a much better conversion of @entity53 's effort on the right , as the young number eight shrugged off @entity17 's tackle to coast over			2
@entity11 pulled his first shot at the posts - a 16th minute penalty attempt - wide , and three minutes later rugby league convert @entity27 had to make way			0
the injuries kept coming for @entity5 with prop @entity63 limping off , but they deservedly got off the mark thanks to @entity11 's 23rd - minute penalty			0
@entity66 of @entity5 ( left ) and @entity67 of @entity0 compete for the ball during the game at @entity6 the @entity70 began to get @entity71 involved as they built through the phases , a snappy break from @entity74 giving them further momentum before @entity11 blundered with a second poor penalty miss. @entity0 pressed for a try just before the interval but prop @entity80 was stopped short from @entity82 's brilliant blind pass			1
@entity47 ignited the @entity0 attack on the resumption by jinking past three @entity5 players , however both sides were guilty of some aimless play during a turgid third quarter			0
@entity0 lifted the intensity to create a second try for @entity9 , a close - in penalty and line - out resulting in the @entity93 hopeful crossing for a seven - pointer from a well - executed drive			2
the visitors hammered away during a prolonged spell near the @entity0 line , but @entity9 came up with the turnover after @entity99 had thwarted @entity5 captain @entity100			1
the bonus point arrived for @entity0 in the 63rd minute when a quickly - taken line - out saw replacements @entity103 and @entity105 pile through , and @entity107 's pass off the deck put his second row partner @entity16 over for a converted try			1
@entity5 deserved their 75th minute try as replacements @entity111 and @entity113 made headway up the right touchline before the latter 's pass out of a tackle sent @entity17 clear for the corner			0
@entity0 made sure they had the final say though , @entity44 and @entity47 combining to good effect as they sent replacement @entity18 over for his second @entity124 try of the season .			0

@entity0 secured their fourth win a row in all competitions at @entity6 on *friday*
@entity9 scored two tries in @entity0 's 33 - 8 victory over @entity5
bonus - point win was *comfortable* for @entity0 against injury - hit visitors
