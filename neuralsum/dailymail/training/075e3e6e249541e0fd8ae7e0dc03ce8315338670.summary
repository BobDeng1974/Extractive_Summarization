investigators said the man could easily have slipped from the top of the wet roof as there was no scaffolding or safety measures in place			2

the @entity25 and immediately issued a @entity59 ordering the worker to come down until scaffolding or other safety improvements had been implemented			1
@entity63 @entity62 heard that the firm ’s managing director had visited the site on the morning the work was due to start , and so knew it would be carried out without scaffolding around the edge of the roof			0
