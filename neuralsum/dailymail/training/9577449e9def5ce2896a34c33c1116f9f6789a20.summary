a strict limit on sugar in pupils ’ lunches is to be scrapped in a major overhaul of school meals , it emerged yesterday			1
the decision , which provoked an outcry from health and obesity experts , comes less than a day after @entity11 chiefs demanded a sharp cut in children ’s sugar intake			1
critics warned ministers against ignoring the @entity11 advice and wasting a chance to slash sugar intake			1
sweets for my sweet : a strict limit on sugar in pupils ' lunches is to be scrapped in a major overhaul of school meals - less than a day after the @entity11 called for a sharp cut in children 's sugar intake one mp described the school lunch proposals , which are almost certain to be implemented , as ‘ puzzling to say the least ’			1
prescribed levels of fat and salt – as well as vitamins and minerals such as iron and calcium – are also set to be abandoned under the @entity40 plans			1
separate rules which dictate how many times certain items such as chips can be served during the week will remain in place			1
those rules will be expanded and updated , for example to specify that wholegrain food must be offered each week to provide fibre to children			1
but more than a quarter of primary schools which trialled the proposed new system exceeded the old sugar limit – of four teaspoons per meal – by more than 10 per cent			2
nutritionists said ‘ robust ’ action is needed to meet a new target from the @entity11 , a subsidiary of the @entity59 , to reduce adults ’ sugar intake to 12 teaspoons per day and children ’s to six			1
on wednesday @entity59 health chiefs went even further , and said adults should aim to halve this to six teaspoons and children to less than six			2
unveiling its draft advice , @entity11 officials said sugar may pose the same threat to health as tobacco			1
it is increasingly implicated in obesity , heart disease and a range of other serious illnesses , they warned			0
a single fizzy drink serving could exceed the six - teaspoon daily limit			0
at present , schools in @entity81 must comply with two sets of catering standards : one covering the frequency that specific items must be served during the week and another prescribing the levels of 14 nutrients in school lunches			1
these nutrient standards stipulate that an average lunch in a primary must contain no more than 15.5g of sugar – equivalent to just under four teaspoons			1
in secondaries the limit is 18.9g , or four - and - a - half teaspoons			2
maximum limits are also set for fat , saturated fat and sodium , and minimums for key nutrients such as iron , fibre , zinc , protein and fibre			2
the @entity40 , which commissioned chefs @entity108 and @entity110 to review school food , said caterers find current rules ‘ over-complicated ’			1
a consultation paper published yesterday said they were ‘ difficult to understand ’ and led to schools paying £ 20 for each recipe to be privately analysed			0
‘ the nutrient - based standards can restrict cooks from being creative , ’ it added			0
under the plans , schools will no longer be required to prove they meet nutrient standards and will instead use new food - based standards to devise menus			0
these state , for example , that desserts , cakes and biscuits must be served only at lunchtime			2
but in a trial of this approach , half of secondaries and a third of primaries failed to stay within the maximum sugar limit			0
there would be ‘ strengthened practical guidance on portion sizes for desserts ’ , in addition to existing limits on the quantity of fruit juices children can drink			0
schools remain barred from offering fizzy drinks			0
@entity149 treats : a single fizzy drink serving could exceed the six - teaspoon daily limit advised by the @entity11 professor @entity152 , an @entity153 nutritionist who helped draw up the new rules , said : ‘ if a school meets all of those food - based standards , it ought to be pretty close to meeting the nutrient standards we previously had			1
schools can be confident they will be close to them			0
’ she said sugar consumption was already higher than the limit in some schools since cooks found the nutrient rules difficult to implement			2
newly - established academy schools will also be required to comply			0
@entity168 , from the @entity169 , said : ‘ these guidelines come just days after the chief medical officer [ @entity171 ] confirmed sugar is the real disaster			2
the @entity11 report was our signpost to crack down on sugar			1
’ @entity178 , a nutritionist at @entity179 and @entity181 ’s campaign director , said the @entity11 ’s target was ‘ such a long way from where we are ’			2
she added : ‘ challenging taste preferences in childhood is vital because it affects the rest of their lives			0
we would want to look at this in detail and whether a child ’s diet at school will be worse than it was before			0
’ @entity197 mp @entity196 said : ‘ i believe parents will be extremely disappointed by this decision			0
‘ why the government would want to reduce the healthiness of school meals is puzzling to say the least			0
the government is going in the wrong direction			0

@entity11 experts says children should have just six teaspoons of sugar a day
current rules says school lunches can have no more than four teaspoons
but prescribed levels of sugar , fat and salt are now set to be abandoned
new guidelines will instead stipulate how often different foods can be served
