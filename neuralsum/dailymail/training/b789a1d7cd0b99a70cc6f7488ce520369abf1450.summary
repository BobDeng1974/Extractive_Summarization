the couple were forced to drive more than 35 miles from @entity30 to @entity31 after medics said they could not look after a baby born so premature miss @entity6 , who had been haemorrhaging , then had to lie and say the bleeding had stopped because she was not allowed to transfer to another hospital while it continued			1

earlier this month he celebrated his first birthday			0
miss @entity6 yesterday called on maternity units to do more to save babies routinely considered ‘ unviable ’			1
she also made an emotional plea for the abortion limit to be lowered to take into account the development of foetuses inside the womb and advances in medicine that are allowing more to survive when they do not reach full - term			1
details of her case come a week after it was revealed another premature baby only survived because he was 0.7 of an ounce over the cut - off point at which medics would fight to save his life			2
miss @entity6 , from @entity62 , @entity39 , said : ‘ if i had listened to staff at @entity30 i would have given up hope and potentially accepted that i would miscarry			2
‘ had i not been transferred because i insisted then he would have died , ’ said miss @entity6 ‘ it ’s always right to be honest with patients but there does need to be more hope and babies need to be given a chance to try and survive			0
’ she added : ‘ i think the abortion limit should be lowered to 20 weeks – especially considering what happened with @entity25			1
by then , you can see their sex – they are a person			0

an ambulance took her to hospital in @entity30 where she was told she was about to miscarry			2
she says she was informed : ‘ your baby is going to die ’			0
‘ we were told to say goodbye to @entity25			2
it felt like the @entity98			0
we were numb , ’ said miss @entity6			0
‘ but when we kept going for scans we were told there was still a heartbeat and i was saying if there is still a heartbeat there is still a chance he could live			2
‘ they said they could n’t do anything if he was to come			0
we thought we would never get the baby we always wanted but @entity9 and i pushed them to ring other hospitals			2
‘ we were so relieved when @entity40 said they would take us			0
but i was told i could only be transferred if i stopped haemorrhaging so i had to lie and told them i had			0
‘ if i had n’t lied , @entity25 would n’t be here as he came just the next day			0
’ the tiny baby was slipped into something similar to a freezer bag to help regulate his temperature when he was born on october 8 last year			1

@entity25 is pictured last @entity132 with his parents while he was still being cared for at the @entity40 in @entity31 and laser eye surgery was needed to treat a condition caused by the oxygen being pumped into his lungs which meant the retinas were starting to detach from his eyes			2

@entity30 hospital says it has a neonatal unit for babies born after 27 weeks and a neonatal intensive care unit for those born before that			1
a spokesman said : ' when a mother has any complications that may necessitate delivery at 23 or 24 weeks , decision around her care are tailored according to her needs and made by consultants			2
' these decisions are based around balancing the risk to the baby being born outside ( the intensive care unit ) , against the risk of the baby being born en - route to another hospital and the likelihood of survival			2
' the @entity170 of @entity171 advises hospitals it is best practice for ' resuscitation not be carried out ' if a baby is born with complications before they get to 23 weeks			1
details of @entity25 's case came a week after it emerged @entity182 , one , who was born at 23 weeks and two days , was only given medical care because he weighed 520g – 20g over the cut - off point at @entity185			1
