@entity1 head coach @entity0 regards @entity3 's @entity2 as the most improved team in test rugby and refuses to view their series opener as a foregone conclusion			1
preparations for the first test at @entity10 have been undermined by a debilitating injury list and the absence of players from @entity15 finalists @entity16 and @entity17			2
it has weakened @entity2 for the toughest assignment in the game , but the @entity1 , who on sunday named a 31 - man squad for the series , are ready to face a growing force in the international arena			1
respect : speaking to the media @entity1 coach @entity0 ( centre ) said his team respects @entity2 missing : the @entity30 meant a lot of players have been missing from the @entity2 squad ' @entity2 have been the most improved side in world rugby in the last two years , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity3 has built depth in his side and a strong culture , so they will be a formidable opponent and one we are very excited about playing			0
' those who think @entity2 will be fielding a weak side in the first @entity9 are completely underestimating the quality of depth in the @entity2 squad			2
' make no mistake , @entity2 have a very strong desire and belief that they can win this series			0
having said that , so do the @entity1			0
@entity0 ( right ) said that it would be unwise to underestimate @entity2 strong : @entity0 called @entity3 's side as the most improved in the world ' this series gives both teams a great opportunity to put a stake in the ground , not only this year , but also for the @entity57			1
' this will add to the pressure on both sides in the upcoming series			0
' @entity57 - winning captain @entity62 leads a squad missing fly - half @entity64 , who is been on a sabbatical from the sport			2
centre @entity68 and lock @entity70 are newcomers to the @entity1 , while veteran back rows @entity73 and @entity74 return to the fold after spells away			0
skipper : @entity62 will captain the @entity1 in the absence of @entity64 newcomer : centre @entity68 is a new addition to the @entity1 squad forwards : @entity84 ( @entity83 ) , @entity86 ( @entity85 ) , @entity88 ( @entity87 ) , @entity89 ( @entity85 ) , @entity90 ( @entity83 ) , @entity91 ( @entity87 ) , @entity92 ( @entity85 ) , @entity93 ( @entity87 ) , @entity95 ( @entity94 ) , @entity96 ( @entity85 ) , @entity97 ( @entity87 ) , @entity98 ( @entity94 ) , @entity99 ( @entity85 ) , @entity100 ( @entity87 , capt ) , @entity101 ( @entity94 ) , @entity102 ( @entity87 ) , @entity103 ( @entity83 )			1
