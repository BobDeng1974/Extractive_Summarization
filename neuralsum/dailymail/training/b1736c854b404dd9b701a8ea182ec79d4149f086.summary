trawling through the water with a magnet , schoolboy @entity0 had only expected a modest haul of scrap metal			1
but , last week , the 16 - year - old from @entity5 stumbled across a rather more shocking discovery – a hidden cache of 40 deadly weapons			1
the arsenal of rusting and grubby guns dating back to the @entity12 included a @entity14 machine gun , which could take down a helicopter , and an @entity17 assault rifle			1
an expert has suggested the guns may have belonged to the @entity20 and could have been dumped when they were meant to be declaring their arms in 2001			1
a teenage metal detector discovered 40 weapons dumped in the @entity26 when trawling the water with a magnet			1
some of the guns may have belonged to members of the @entity20 , experts said the teenager from @entity33 had taken up the unusual hobby of magnet fishing six months ago , but had only managed to salvage the odd bit of scrap metal			1
but while combing @entity39 on the @entity26 with a rope and a strong magnet tied to the end , he and a friend suddenly came across a 40 - strong haul of terrifying weapons			1
in the 1980s weapons and explosives were smuggled across the @entity47 by the @entity20 in ferries or small boats			1
members chose the most remote areas on @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 to hide them as they planned to take their fight to the mainland			2
sources at the time said that they were then stashed in forests and hills across @entity61 and in the @entity62 of @entity54			0
sites in @entity64 were also chosen			0
in @entity52 weapons were also dumped in the @entity66 and also all along the south coast , making rural @entity5 a likely spot for an arms cache			2
among them were parts of a @entity74 @entity73 light machine gun , which has a 600m killing range , and a @entity78 @entity77 9mm submachine gun			1
he told @entity80 : ‘ i was shocked			0
i ’ve never found anything like this before			2
there were a few whole weapons , but not many			2
some were machine guns , pistols and revolvers			0
and there was a massive machine gun on a stand			0
‘ there was a fisherman getting quite angry as i was disturbing the water			0
but when he saw what i pulled out , he came and helped			0
’ though he threw most back into the water , he took one of the guns – thought to be a 1930s @entity99 .38 - home to play with			1
however when his mum @entity100 saw him playing with the gun , she called 999 and an armed police arrived minutes later			0
the 37 - year - old said : ‘ nothing illegal is allowed in the house			1
‘ but i did n’t think i ’d be dealing with one of my kids holding a gun			0
i said , “ bring it downstairs , leave it in the kitchen and do n’t touch it ”			0
’ @entity113 , 16 , said he had ' never found anything like it before '			2
a fisherman helped the teenager pull the haul of weapons out of the water among the guns was an @entity17 dubbed the @entity123 ( top ) by @entity125 troops fighting the @entity20 in @entity126 a handout image of the deadly gun used by @entity20 troops in the battle for @entity131 another of the weapons found by the teenager is thought to be a @entity74 @entity73 42 used in @entity135 in the second half of the @entity12 ( file image ) police dredged the river the next day to recover the rest of the weapons			1
a spokesman for @entity143 said : ‘ none of the weapons were complete , and they were extremely rusty and very old			0
all of the weapon parts have been or are being destroyed			0
’ an expert suggested that the weapons could have been used by the @entity20 during @entity150 and may have been dumped when republicans were meant to be declaring their arms in 2001			1
former @entity154 sergeant and author @entity153 , who served in @entity131 during 1979 , said the weapons could have been used by the @entity20 during @entity150			1
he said : ‘ this must be a terrorist bundle			0
that ’s because there are weapons for various ranges — from close assassination ones to the @entity164 that could take out a helicopter or @entity166			0
‘ a large machine gun barrel means it could be the @entity20			2
were they included when they declared their arms ? or were they held back in case they did n’t get a deal they wanted ? ’			0
experts said some of the rifles may have been used by @entity20 fighters during @entity150			2
