@entity0 has only one message for @entity2 and @entity3 before their world - championship decider in @entity6 — race any way you like			1
the @entity10 team chairman drew on all his experience as a triple world champion to tell @entity13 : ‘ i will give them no orders whatsoever			1
only the two guys can figure out how best to proceed			2
it is sensible to leave them to it			0
’ @entity2 and @entity3 clashed at @entity19 in august when the @entity20 refused to yield to his former karting partner ’s gung - ho move early in the race			1
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 face off in their world - championship decider in @entity6 on sunday debris flies in the air as @entity3 ( right ) clashes with @entity2 at the @entity28 @entity27 in august @entity2 ( left ) currently leads @entity3 by 17 points in the @entity31 standings @entity3 — harshly in the opinion of most observers — was publicly reprimanded by the team for his part in what the stewards deemed to be no more than a ‘ racing incident ’			1
‘ we told them after @entity19 not to crash into one another , and nothing bad has happened since , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ but this is the final race			0
@entity2 leads by 17 points			1
they both want the world championship so interference from me would make no sense			2
they both know the possible danger to their own car if they get involved with each other			0
that is all they need to know			0
’ one issue that is scheduled for discussion within 48 hours of sunday ’s finish is @entity2 ’s contract			1
he is signed to @entity10 for next year but no further			1
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates another @entity10 victory with his dream pairing in october ‘ i have heard stories that @entity2 wanted to sign for @entity62 , but that is absolutely wrong , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity64 ( @entity65 , who is in day - to - day charge of @entity10 ) and i have a very good relationship with @entity2			1
‘ @entity2 requested we leave the contract talk until the season was over			2
he wanted to concentrate on his racing			0
we had exactly the same opinion			0
he will stay regardless of whether he wins or loses on sunday			2
’ but who will deal with the contract minutiae for @entity2 is unclear since his recent split from @entity76 , @entity78 ’s management stable			2
yet he remains on good terms with @entity78 and has retained a few of the mogul ’s staff — at least until he decides who he wants to represent him in future			0
@entity2 ’s long - time lawyer @entity85 , seen as a power behind the throne , will no doubt have an important role but his father , @entity89 , remains another significant influence			1
how does @entity0 evaluate his two drivers ? ‘ from a speed point of view they are the same			0
only thousandths of seconds can separate them			0
@entity3 is hard - working			1
he looks at every detail and sorts everything out			0
@entity2 is a very aggressive talent			2
he can overtake like nobody else			0
' the reason they are so successful is that they develop the car in the same direction			0
to me they are both world champions , but after @entity6 only one of them will be			1
’ @entity108 announced last night they will not decide until ‘ a date no earlier than december 1 ’ which driver to pair with @entity111 next season			0
that means @entity114 and @entity115 are possibly in a shoot - out in @entity6 , despite chairman @entity117 having promised a decision before the end of the season and sources categorically saying that @entity115 would get the seat .			1
