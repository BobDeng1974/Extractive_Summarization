@entity0 celebrated the 10th anniversary of his @entity3 debut with a brilliant goal , as @entity3 maintained their four point lead over rivals @entity6 ahead of next week 's @entity7			1
@entity0 inched closer to breaking @entity10 's all - time @entity9 scoring record , notching his 250th goal , leaving him one strike behind the @entity15 legend			1
he could now write history against @entity6 next saturday , quite probably aided by the return of @entity18 from suspension			2
@entity0 was instrumental in this win over @entity21 , which saw @entity3 keep their eighth clean sheet in eight games , @entity25 extending his own record to 720 minutes unbeaten — although @entity21 deserved to be ahead at half - time			1
re @entity28 ( left ) scored the second goal for @entity3 and he celebrates above after helping create the third goal for @entity0 @entity31 lifts the ball over @entity21 keeper @entity33 to give @entity3 the lead after an hour at the @entity35 @entity28 wheels away along with team - mate @entity31 to celebrate after scoring @entity3 's second goal in the 72nd minute @entity3 : @entity25 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 55 ) , @entity31 , @entity45 ( @entity46 71 ) , @entity0 , @entity28 ( @entity47 76 )			1

on thursday , a decade after he first appeared in a @entity3 shirt , he thanked everyone at the club and the supporters in an emotional message , and pledged to continue in the same vein			2
he did just that , here			0
@entity81 likes to his shuffle his pack at the best of times and with two huge games coming up , he made changes			1
@entity3 host @entity87 on tuesday , an important @entity90 clash after their defeat by @entity92 , before heading to the @entity93 to play arch - rivals @entity6 on saturday			1
@entity96 and @entity97 , mainstays in midfield , were rested completely			0
it meant that @entity42 could play in his favoured defensive midfield position , where he performed so stoically for @entity100 during the @entity101 , and youngster @entity43 was also afforded his first start of the season			0
completing the trio was veteran @entity31 , another player who has had limited game - time under the @entity107 coach			1
this match was a potential banana skin for @entity3			2
@entity21 , minnows from the @entity111 in @entity9 for the first time , have started the season well , out - performing much bigger local rivals @entity15 and @entity115			1
with important games ahead , perhaps @entity3 's eye could have slipped off the ball			1
it seemed like that was the case in the first half			0
the crowd were expecting a goal feast but none were forthcoming , with @entity21 making the best two chances of the game			1
after 20 minutes @entity28 cut in superbly from the left and fed @entity0 , who took the ball into the box			1
four defenders swarmed around him and one eventually lurched in to slide the ball clear			0
the @entity132 should have opened the scoring a minute later , receiving @entity38 ’ low pass but seeing his shot from close range turned behind by goalkeeper @entity33			0
@entity0 skips past challenges from the @entity21 defence as @entity3 ran out 3 - 0 winners at the @entity35 @entity0 ends up in the back of the net shortly after failing to score for the home side in their comfortable @entity9 win @entity144 singer @entity143 watches the action inside the @entity35 with her son @entity147 , with husban @entity39 in action @entity39 smiles at @entity143 before the @entity9 clash as @entity3 opened up a four - point advantage at the top of the table over @entity6 @entity0 ’s scooped cross towards @entity28 evaded the @entity153 by inches and nearly crept in at the far post , before his own powerful header was straight down @entity33 ’s throat , with @entity3 pushing for the opener			1
but then @entity39 , in trouble during the week for his furious row with @entity3 police , decided to backheel the ball to @entity40 inside the box			2
his flick was a little short and @entity21 retrieved the ball , but could n't work an opening for a shot on goal			1
@entity170 ’s side sniffed blood and they created two chances which should have ended @entity25 ’s clean sheet streak			2
the first saw @entity62 flick the ball past the @entity177 stopper but hit the side - netting with the goal gaping			1
the second required @entity25 to make an excellent save , with @entity64 getting in behind the defence but failing to shoot sufficiently wide of the goalkeeper			0
at the other end @entity31 had a low effort turned wide of the far post by @entity33 , but it was n’t enough to satisfy @entity3 fans who were hoping to see the side put away six goals , like they did in the previous home league game against @entity190 , and there were grumbles at half - time			1
@entity3 duels for the ball with @entity63 of @entity21 during the game @entity28 , scored and assisted on the night , as he fends off his marker before attempting to play a cross into the @entity21 box @entity0 goes close to scoring for @entity3 as his header is saved by @entity21 keeper @entity33 @entity201 boss @entity81 instructs his team during their seventh league win in eight matches they did n’t have to wait too long for their team to open the scoring though			1
although the focus was on @entity0 trying to score the three goals he needs to overtake @entity10 , he was happy to turn provider			2
@entity0 ’s played in a slightly more withdrawn role this season and it worked to good effect here , with @entity31 feeding him and then darting into the box			1
@entity0 waited before slipping in the veteran midfielder , who clipped the ball home comfortably			0
and then it was two , with a @entity153 connection			0
@entity31 played in @entity38 , whose cross was volleyed home into the bottom right corner , by @entity28			1
the forward has really come to life this season after a mixed start to his @entity3 career			0
he turned provider for the third , which was brilliantly taken by @entity0			0
the man they call ‘ @entity234 ’ , the flea , buzzed away from his marker in midfield , found @entity28 and then fired the return ball into the far corner from a tight angle			0
it was typical of so many of the goals that he has put away in this grand arena			0
he should have scored again at the death to match @entity10 ’s record , heading straight at @entity246 when chipped through by @entity44			0
but @entity0 now just needs two goals to become the greatest goalscorer in @entity250 football history and , with his pedigree , you would n’t bet against both of them coming next saturday at the @entity93			0
after all , he is the man for the big occasion , and has scored more goals against @entity6 than any other side			2
@entity258 , @entity259 , beware			0
@entity0 now has 250 goals in @entity9 , in 285 games , two short of matching @entity15 legend @entity10 's all - time record total of 251			1
@entity263 kept an eye on him as he tried to break the historic milestone ... 10m : @entity0 had received the ball a few times but @entity21 were tight to him and dispossessed him on each occasion , sometimes fairly , sometimes unfairly			1
as has been a bigger feature of his game this season under @entity81 , he 's helped out with ball recovery , and today was no different			2
20m : took the ball into the box but with four defenders frantically swarming around him , one finally came in and cut him out			0
immediately afterwards he should have scored when cut in from the right , but the keeper did well to put it behind for a corner			0
30m : @entity0 was razor sharp to a mix up on the edge of the box and nipped in , but fired inches wide across the face of goal			2
cheeky cross towards @entity287 , slightly too far but it nearly crept in at the far post			0
45m : @entity0 header on target from a @entity45 cross , leaving the crowd chanting his name before the break			0
60m : @entity31 played the ball into @entity0 who held it up and then slid it back to the midfielder , who fired home			1
this season he 's really enjoyed playing in a slightly deeper role and creating chances for his team - mates			0
75m : @entity0 got his goal , after some brilliant work in midfield and a one - two with @entity28 , he drilled the ball across goal and into the far corner			1
90m : job done , but @entity0 could have matched @entity10 's record when he headed straight at the goalkeeper from a couple of yards out after @entity44 picked him out .			2

@entity3 have won seven of their first eight @entity9 games following 3 - 0 win over @entity21
@entity31 struck after an hour as @entity28 and @entity0 also add to the score sheet at the @entity35
@entity81 's side yet to *concede* a goal after their first eight league matches of the campaign
barca four points clear of @entity6 at the top of the table
