just braking or changing gears can take a great deal of effort			2
and this is made all the more difficult by the cold and rain			0

the @entity5 will support the @entity164			0
putting a brave face on : smiling @entity166 manages to ignore the bad weather as he drives a 1903 @entity168 up @entity66 near @entity67 , @entity68 , during the @entity5 full steam ahead : @entity170 drives his 1900 @entity172 steam car during the @entity5 @entity42 - bound : entrants to the world 's longest running motoring celebration , which spans 116 years , did n't let the bad weather deter them during the 63 mile drive			1
