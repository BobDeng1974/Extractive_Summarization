the broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with arthritis an artificial version of a compound in broccoli could hold the key to treating arthritis , say researchers			1
the broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with the condition			1
but patients would have to eat several pounds of the vegetable every day to derive any significant benefit			1
sulforaphane in its natural form is also too unstable to turn into a medicine			2
but @entity25 drug company @entity24 has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment			1
a single dose of the drug , known as @entity32 or @entity33 - 01 , is the equivalent of eating 5.5lb of broccoli in one day			2
in tests on mice affected by osteoarthritis , @entity32 significantly improved bone architecture , gait balance and movement			0
professor @entity42 , who co-led the research at the @entity44 in @entity45 , said : ‘ these initial results are very positive for such an experiment and we have convinced ourselves that sulforaphane is a promising agent for the treatment of osteoarthritis			2
‘ the clinical development of sulforaphane has been held back by the fact that it is inherently unstable – @entity55 is a major advance in this area			0
’ professor @entity42 added : ‘ nearly nine million people in the @entity25 have osteoarthritis and it costs the @entity60 more than £ 5 billion every year			0
but @entity25 drug company @entity24 has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment ( file picture ) ' there is no cure or effective treatment for the disease other than pain relief or joint replacement , so the potential for @entity73 is massive			1
’ @entity74 is also believed to reduce the risk of some cancers and cardiovascular disease , and improve symptoms of autism			0
a @entity81 study found it could be used to prevent throat cancer			0
in laboratory tests , extracts from broccoli were shown to give mice protection against oral cancer .			0
