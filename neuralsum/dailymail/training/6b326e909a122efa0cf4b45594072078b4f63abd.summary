putting down the box she had been carrying , @entity0 leaned against a wall and took a deep breath			1
she 'd walked only 500 yards from the car to her daughter @entity7 's beauty salon , but the effort had left her gasping as if she 'd ran up a hill			0
she thought it was her asthma playing up			2
' i 'd been diagnosed with it years before and , although i did n't need to use my inhaler often , it occasionally flared up when i was walking uphill or for long distances , or carrying something heavy , ' says @entity0 , 62 , a retired district nurse who lives with her husband @entity18 , 61 , a retired engineering company director , in @entity19			1
i was n't feeling at all unwell and had no other symptoms			2
but days later , when i was still getting breathless , i decided to follow her advice			0
i thought i 'd get a new inhaler and that would be that			0
' @entity0 saw a young gp , instead of her usual doctor , who noted that she had n't had her asthma investigated properly for some time , and sent her for a chest x-ray			1
it was a decision that probably saved @entity0 's life			1
just over a week later , she had an x-ray at the @entity38 in @entity19 - this revealed a small , opaque shadow on her right lung			1
' the doctors thought it was scarring from an old infection , so they decided to leave it for four weeks to see if it would repair itself , ' says @entity0			2
but when she returned for the follow - up x-ray in february 2010 , the shadow was still there			2
' the consultant turned to me and said i 'd have to see someone else			0
my heart sank - i had enough knowledge from my time as a district nurse to know the outlook was n't good			2
' within a week , @entity0 was back in hospital with @entity18 to be told it might be cancer			1
' but i did n't believe it could be			2
i felt too well for that , ' she says			0
indeed , her scans and a biopsy came back clear			0
' thankfully , the consultant knew that it could n't be nothing and he did n't want to send me away without investigating further , ' she says			2
the retired district nurse had n't smoked for years a second biopsy found some suspicious cells on @entity0 's lung , and she was told she 'd need surgery to remove them			1
three weeks later , she had a lobectomy to remove the top segment of her right lung			2
' as i walked into the consultant 's office for the results , he took one look at me and asked why there was no one with me , ' says @entity0			2
' i 'd done such a good job of convincing myself it would n't be cancer that i 'd decided it would be ok to go alone			2
' but then the consultant told @entity0 he 'd removed a small - 3.7 cm - cancer ' which would probably buy me another five years '			1
i just could n't believe it			0
i 'd always thought of lung cancer as a heavy - smoking , old - man 's disease			1
' years before , i 'd been a social smoker , only smoking the odd cigarette when out with friends			0
in times of stress , i 'd smoke a bit more , but i 'd never have more than ten in any one day			0
some days , i would n't have any at all			0
but when i was diagnosed with cancer , i had n't actually smoked for ten years , because it had started to bring on my asthma			1
i just did n't think lung cancer would ever affect me			1
' @entity0 is one of a growing number of women being diagnosed with the disease - in the @entity103 , the number affected has risen by 13 per cent over the past decade , according to @entity105			1
this year , death rates from lung cancer among @entity109 women are set to overtake those for breast cancer , according to a study of cancer rates in 28 @entity115 countries published last week			1
researchers from the @entity117 , who carried out the study , say the trend is largely due to women in the @entity103 and their long history of smoking			0
but cancer experts are quick to point out that occasional smokers and even non-smokers are also at risk			0
@entity128 , a consultant thoracic surgeon at @entity129 in @entity130 , says : ' decades ago , we saw a rise in more women smoking			0
while in recent years that number has decreased , particularly among middle - aged women , smoking among young women is still quite prevalent			2
' another change is in the type of cigarettes people smoke			1
when @entity0 did smoke , she tended to choose extra-mild , low - tar varieties			1
mr @entity128 says : ' many people , especially women , have moved on to low - tar cigarettes in the mistaken belief they 're better for them - but there is some evidence to suggest that people inhale these more deeply than they would a stronger cigarette in order to get the same effects			1
this has led to a change in the types of cancer we now see			0
' the two types of lung cancer most often seen in the @entity103 are squamous cell carcinoma ( usually found in the centre of the lung ) and adenocarcinoma ( the type diagnosed in @entity0 , and often found in the outer areas of the lungs )			1
@entity0 is one of a growing number of women being diagnosed with the disease in recent years , surgeons like mr @entity128 have seen a rise in adenocarcinoma , which is the most common lung cancer in women - possibly as they inhale low - tar cigarettes more deeply - and in non-smokers , though experts are unclear why			1
' people think of lung cancer as a smoker 's disease and there 's this idea that if you stop smoking , your risk of lung cancer somehow decreases back to the level of someone who never smoked at all			1
' in fact , that does n't happen			0
it 's simply not true to assume that risk is eliminated once you stop smoking			0
' nor is it simply that heavy smokers are most at risk			0
' the truth is , we just do n't know why some people smoke heavily for years and never get lung cancer , while some occasional smokers do			1
' unfortunately , as @entity202 , professor of thoracic surgery at @entity204 , says , too often lung cancer is detected only once it 's spread			1
while this is true for both men and women , it does n't help women 's diagnosis that the traditional image of a lung cancer patient is the older man			1
' the fact is , we are seeing more women in their 40s or 50s who 've smoked 20 cigarettes a day since the ages of 13 and 15 , ' says professor @entity202			2
' their tumours are generally peripheral adenocarcinomas on the outer edges of the lungs , small and aggressive , which spread rapidly			0
' these are treatable with surgery , followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy , if caught early enough			0
but too often , women ignore symptoms like a bad cough or breathlessness , or attribute them to something else , only seeing a doctor once the cancer has spread			0
the official advice is to see a gp if you 've had a persistent cough for three weeks , feel breathless , or start to cough up blood			0
the good news is that advances in medicine are making certain types of lung cancer more treatable			1
after surgery , @entity0 underwent chemotherapy and , in april , she will have been in remission for five years professor @entity202 says : ' we know that in the @entity109 population , about 15 per cent of female lung cancer patients who have never smoked have a particular gene mutation that makes them more susceptible to developing lung cancer			1
the @entity258 , or epidermal growth factor receptor , mutation is virtually exclusively found in adenocarcinomas			0
' patients with this mutation show an impressive response to newly developed drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors , which bind to the surface of cancer cells to stop them growing and dividing , says professor @entity202			0
he adds : ' large studies have found survival and quality of life to be better in patients carrying those mutations when using the new drugs versus intravenous chemotherapy , no matter what stage their cancer is at , and patients with advanced - stage cancer are now routinely tested for the mutation			2
' after surgery , @entity0 underwent chemotherapy and , in april , she will have been in remission for five years			1
she now tries to live her life to the full and is the picture of health			0
' when i tell people that i had lung cancer , they do n't believe me , ' she says			1
' like me , they thought lung cancer only affected older men			1
' i want everyone to be aware that anyone is susceptible and to know the symptoms - even if they have just one , like i did			0
' thanks to my daughter and that young gp , my cancer was detected early enough to give me a fighting chance			0
without that , i may not have lived to feel as lucky as i do			0
' @entity105 's @entity306 campaign is targeting election candidates ahead of the @entity308 to back measures to improve cancer survival in the @entity103 through earlier diagnosis and greater access to the best treatment			0

@entity0 , 62 , from @entity19 , had her asthma checked out
x-ray revealed she had lung cancer - though she had n't smoked for years
when @entity0 did smoke , she chose extra-mild , low - tar varieties
many people move on to low - tar cigarettes in the belief they 're better
but evidence suggests people inhale these more deeply
