the mummified bodies of soldiers who fell in the @entity2 100 years ago are still being uncovered as glaciers melt - and experts say there could be many more to come			1
corpses emerge every time there is a hot summer in @entity9 , a rugged part of the @entity12 alps where countless men were shot , starved or froze to death in a three - year campaign			1
whenever the gruesome finds appear , archaeologists must act within hours - because not only do the bodies decompose , they are also looted by opportunistic thieves			2
frozen in time : mummified remains of two teenage @entity23 soldiers were found in the @entity24 in 2012			1
dr @entity25 , director of the @entity26 in @entity9 , blamed global warming gun : an @entity29 found poking out of the ground , protected until its discovery by a thick layer of ice			1
but dr @entity25 said many finds are stripped bare by looters who then sell the war artefacts on the internet dr @entity25 , the director of the @entity9 's @entity26 , has blamed global warming for the surge in corpses found in the last decade			1
the last two soldiers , found side - by - side in 2012 on the @entity24 , were as young as 16 and 18 when they went to fight on the bitter @entity12 front and were buried by fellow fighters in a crevice			1
archaeologists who studied their bones to age the bodies said both were shot in the head in 1918			2
one of the young men still had a spoon tucked into his uniform for digging away at rations			0
other remains have been found almost every year before that dating back to 2004 , when a major discovery of three @entity23 soldiers buried in the ice made global headlines			1
dr @entity25 , who watched the autopsy of the most recent bodies , told @entity65 : ' it was very emotional			2
the first moment i looked at the boy i thought about his mother , who would have seen him for the last time and never heard from her young son again			2
' corpses have been found in the @entity72 almost every year since 2004 , when these mummified remains emerged elusive : one body yet to be found is that of captain @entity77 , 24 ( right ) , who led @entity12 troops on the 3,678m peak of @entity80 in august 1918			1
the war would drag on until a final victory in october more than a million soldiers from both sides were killed on the @entity12 front , which ranged across more than 400 miles with battles lasting almost the entire length of the @entity2			1
the long fight , much of it in the mountains where blizzards could send temperatures dropping to minus 30 degrees celsius , was between @entity12 forces and those of the @entity96			1
although the two sides had been allies until the time when war broke out , old emnities quickly showed and in april 1915 , @entity12 changed sides by signing the @entity102 in secret			1
@entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 - all part of the @entity108 - persuaded @entity12 to leave the @entity109 , which it had until then maintained with @entity111 and @entity96			2
the brutal mountain war stretched on until october 1918 and the @entity113 , which saw the final defeat of @entity96 troops and a crucial victory for those on the @entity118			0
historians have been collecting material from the mountains ever since , with regular finds since the early 1990s			0
dangerous terrain : while @entity106 forces suffered disease in the trenches , those on the @entity12 front had to string the razor wire denoting @entity130 across the edge of perilous cliff tops hazardous : the @entity12 front , marked by the red line , stretched for hundreds of miles over the @entity72 discoveries have included clothes , shoes and a remarkably intact letter from a soldier to his lover			1
on the peak of @entity144 , historians uncovered an entire cableway station concealed beneath the ice , with soldiers ' letters still pinned to the walls			0
but recovering the bodies is not easy because of looters and thieves , claimed dr @entity25			0
' we 're not able to go on the glaciers and research the bodies ourselves , ' he said			0
' we have to wait until they are found by people making excavations for work or hiking			0
' usually people take away everything from the body and only call us or the police afterwards			0
often we find bodies with none of the equipment of a soldier around them			0
' people then sell what they 've found online - i 've seen it happening			0
it 's surreal that you would get people going up the mountain just to find 100 - year - old things they could sell on the internet			0
' there were no bodies last year , said dr @entity25			0
now his team are waiting to see whether any will turn up this summer - but after heavy snow in the last few months , they fear the secrets of the past could remain hidden for many years longer .			2

soldiers fought in the @entity72 in temperatures *plummeting* to minus @entity190
battles raged for more than three years and killed more than a million
bodies revealed every time there is a hot summer in @entity9 , *northern* @entity12
but often *walkers* strip them of *valuables* before they can be recovered
archaeological director claims global *warning* means there will be many more
