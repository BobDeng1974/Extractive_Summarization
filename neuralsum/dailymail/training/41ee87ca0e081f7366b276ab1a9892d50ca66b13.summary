by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 2 april 2013 it was once a skill we all took for granted , but now it appears fewer than one in ten young people can change a plug			1
only eight per cent of 18 to 25 - year - olds now say they could confidently rewire a plug without help or instruction , according to new research			1
moreover , only five per cent of young people would be confident unblocking a sink , while only six per cent said they would be happy to bleed a radiator			0
where does this wire go ? just 8 per cent of young people in the @entity16 are confident enough to rewire a plug an inept 17 per cent said they would n't even be confident hanging a picture , with only 12 per cent vowing themselves capable of using a power drill			2
just four per cent said they could put up wallpaper , and more than a fifth ( 21 per cent ) , doubted their own ability to assemble flat - pack furniture			0
a spokesperson from @entity28 , who conducted the survey , said : ' in the past electrical goods came without a plug attached so it was necessary to know how to wire one			0
' now though our toasters and tvs come with the plugs already fitted so it seems wiring one is becoming something of a lost skill			0
' the @entity43 weekend is traditionally a time to tackle diy tasks but it seems young people are content to sit back and let @entity47 take the strain			0
let ’s hope future generations do n’t lose the skills their fathers and grandfathers took for granted			0
' left a bit ... : an inept 17 per cenr said they would n't even be confident in hanging up a picture up one man said : ' i still have to ring up my @entity47 for @entity60 help			1
i can just about manage to put a bookshelf together ' ( picture posed by model ) one young man who took part in the survey said : ' i still have to ring up my @entity47 for @entity60 help			1
i can just about manage to put a bookshelf together , but for anything more complicated i need his help			0
' it ’s not the end of the world that i ’m unable to do certain @entity60 tasks , i mean , if it were n’t for people like me there ’d be no work for plumbers and electricians			2
' a woman who took part commented : ' it ’s very unattractive in a man not to be able to do simple jobs round the house			1
although i have to admit if there is a @entity60 task i ca n’t do my first response is to reach for the internet			2
' pretty as a picture : while only 12 per cent can use a power drill , women say they find men not able to do simple @entity60 unattractive			1

over *90* **%** of 18 - 25 - year - olds can not change a plug with confidence
one fifth ca n't hang a picture , and only 5 **%** would unblock a sink
women say it *'s* ' very unattractive for a man not to be able to do simple jobs '
male *participants* say they ring parents for @entity60 help , women look online
