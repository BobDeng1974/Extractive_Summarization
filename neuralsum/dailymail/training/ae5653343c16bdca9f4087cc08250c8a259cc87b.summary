the show , filmed by @entity19 - which also made @entity3 - is set to focus on how people living in different ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other and could air on @entity24 next year			1
film crews approached people in a residential street in @entity12 , @entity13 , and told locals they were filming a pilot documentary for a potential new series which could be called ' immigration street ' the show , filmed by @entity19 in @entity31 , @entity12 , pictured , is set to focus on how people living in different ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other and could air on @entity24 next year although the programme is only in the development stage at the moment , if it is commissioned for a full series it is set to be filmed over the summer			1
film crews have been spending time in the ' vibrant and diverse ' @entity31 area of @entity12 and have interviewed residents and locals for the show			1
however , the presence of the cameras has caused alarm to some residents and local figures who fear the road will be portrayed negatively			1
@entity50 mp @entity49 , who represents the area , said : ‘ @entity31 is a very vibrant , diverse and strong working part of @entity12			1
‘ it is a community which has been there for a very long time , pretty much everyone there was born in @entity12			1
‘ it seems quite extraordinary that a company wants to come and brand an area with a particular name they have decided in advance			0
’ the mp fears the show will result in @entity31 being portrayed in the same negative light as @entity3 , @entity65 , in controversial show @entity3			1
the presence of film cameras has caused alarm to some residents and local figures who fear @entity31 in @entity12 will be portrayed negatively a @entity24 spokesman said : ' @entity19 are researching a potential new series for @entity24 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another ' he added : ‘ i do fear , with their track record , this is not going to be a show which actually points out all of the good things that are going on the area			1
‘ yes , it is a culturally diverse area of the city , but the idea that one particular street is " an immigrant street " does n't seem accurate			2
‘ we saw this with @entity3			1
some people on the show had no idea certain things were going to be said or shown on the show			2
‘ it produced a picture which they did not recognise and it distorted substantially what those people in @entity65 wanted to say			0
’ after learning about the possibility of the show coming to @entity12 , mr @entity49 wrote a letter to @entity31 's residents			1
he also said he had heard rumours film crews may have offered enticements for people to appear in the show , something the producers refute			1
mr @entity49 added : ‘ i have written to everybody who lives in @entity31 and asked them what they think about it all			1
‘ the way a number of people on the street may have been approached is giving cause for alarm , if it is true			0
‘ they allegedly approached people and offered to do their washing or take them out for meals , provided they do certain things in certain ways			0
@entity50 mp @entity49 fears the show will result in @entity31 being portrayed in the same negative light as @entity3 , @entity65 , in controversial show @entity3 @entity131 , known as ' @entity131 ' has become one of the most famous characters portrayed in @entity24 's @entity3 @entity3 focused on the residents of @entity3 in @entity135 , @entity65 , where it was reported that more than 90 per cent of residents lived on benefits			1
screened over five episodes starting in january , it was controversial with politicians and the police and resulted in hundreds of complaints			2
it made household names of residents such as @entity131 , the self - styled ‘ mother ’ of the street			2
early episodes featured residents of the street confessing to cameras that they had fraudulently claimed benefits , and at one point cameras even followed a man around central @entity65 on a shop - lifting spree			2
police investigations were launched after the footage was aired			0
the series generated around 960 complaints to @entity159 and another 800 to @entity160 is the channel ’s biggest ratings hit since its coverage of the @entity164 in 2012			2
@entity24 and programme makers love productions claim the street is typical of hundreds of @entity170 communities struggling to cope with economic and social decline			1
but some critics labelled it ‘ poverty porn ’ and said it is paints a false picture of life in modern @entity170			0
others praised it for exposing the truth of benefits fraud but said it failed to condemn crime and also exploits children , exposing them to bullying and victimisations			0
some residents said the show - which shows children swearing and misbehaving - has left youngsters to ashamed and embarrassed to go to school			1
‘ if that were true , and it has come to me second and third hand , it would suggest the programme would be set up in a way to run to a script			0
‘ therefore it wo n't reflect what is happening in the area , and that is very alarming			0
‘ but this is more serious - this is about a real street , a real community , a real city and things which are really happening			0
‘ i think there is an absolute responsibility on anybody who is making such a programme to get it right and start off right			0
’ producers say they have not yet finalised a name for the new series but admitted ' @entity17 ' has been discussed and is a possibility			1
a @entity24 spokesman said : ‘ @entity19 are researching a potential new series for @entity24 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another			1
‘ the title and location are not yet confirmed and discussions are ongoing with local people			2
‘ @entity3 sparked an important debate about the welfare system			2
‘ it was a fair and balanced observational documentary series and was a sympathetic , humane and objective portrayal of how people are coping with continuing austerity and cuts in benefits			0
‘ we strongly refute any suggestion that any resident of @entity31 has been offered bribes or gifts on condition of filming them			1
@entity245 , of the @entity31 - based @entity246 said the tv show was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is @entity251 , creative director at @entity19 , said @entity31 in @entity12 was the current focus for the show due to the number of immigrants living there ‘ any filming the team have done would follow strict protocols in accordance with the @entity261			1
’ cleaner @entity262 , who flies @entity265 flags from his home in @entity31 , has already been filmed by the crew			2
the 56 - year - old said : ‘ i 've done a lot of filming with them already , i do n't have a problem with it			2
‘ i 'm a hard - working man and i 've lived here for three years , i used to live over the road before that			0
‘ i do n't know how it will end up , but i do n't think i 've put myself in any danger			0
’ @entity278 , 21 , a student living in @entity31 said he finds it offensive that families on the street have been asked to appear in the show			1
he said : " ’ i find it offensive to the families that live here			0
‘ maybe it was a bad area ages ago , but now all i see is good and normal people from different countries around the world			0
’ however @entity245 , of the @entity31 - based @entity246 said it was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is			1
he said : ‘ i think it 's good			0
it shows the multi-cultural environment of people living in @entity31			2
‘ they should show a positive aspect of the community and show how hard working people are here			2
’ councillor @entity302 , @entity303 cabinet member for communities , said : ‘ i do have concerns about a potential programme called @entity307			0
@entity12 residents fear ' @entity17 ' could portray them negatively and attract attention like @entity3 did to the residents of @entity311 in @entity65 , including @entity312 , pictured ‘ we have a variety of diverse communities in @entity12 and community cohesion is something we should pride ourselves on			1
‘ my concern is it will not show that , and i am genuinely worried about vulnerable people in that area in @entity31			1
‘ some people could be taken advantage of as they will not realise how the final edit will portray them			0
’ @entity251 , creative director at @entity19 , said the idea for ‘ @entity17 ’ came about during the filming of @entity3			1
he said : ‘ it came about as a result of the second episode of @entity3 where we featured one house which changed hands several times and was mainly occupied my immigrants			2
‘ it was described as one of the most sensitively - handled pieces on immigration at the time and we felt it was worth doing a series			0
‘ the idea of immigrants being in @entity170 and how they get by when they ’re here and the effect they have on communities felt like something that was useful for us to do			0
’ mr @entity251 said the crew were currently meeting people and looking into various locations although @entity31 was the current focus			2
film crews spent 12 months filming residents in @entity3 , @entity65 , pictured , for the controversial series @entity3 he said : ‘ it ’s an area which we researched and we knew from the @entity359 has large number of immigrants settling there			1
‘ it felt like a place that was going to be interesting place and had interesting characters living quite diverse lives			0
‘ of course you ’re going to get some people that say they do n’t want to be involved but there ’s lots of people who are happy to be filmed			0
‘ like all documentary series you have to be respectful because people are naturally nervous			0
‘ we are run by very strict guidelines on how we operate			0
we do n’t pay people , we do n’t bribe people – these things simply do n’t happen			0
we ’re not in the business of stitching people up			0
' it ’s about showing a fair , honest , truthful account of showing what happens in a street over a certain period			0
