by @entity0 anyone who 's familiar with @entity2 will know about the @entity3			0
while we 're yet to see such a gadget that conceals objects completely , a firm has developed a ' cloak ' that makes people 's data invisible from large companies such as @entity12			1
the unique coat blocks radio waves to stop firms using phones and other devices to collect data on our everyday lives			1
the @entity20 ( pictured ) , which admittedly looks similar to a duvet , is a padded cloak fitted with metallic fibres			1
these fibres block part of the electromagnetic spectrum from accessing devices inside the pockets			2

the technology , known as inductive charging , comes from the new @entity49 - 50 wireless charging plate			0
this was fitted into a piece of clothing to let people charge devices in their trousers while wearing them			2
‘ we think that integrating wearable tech into a wardrobe staple , makes the technology more accessible to the image conscious , ’ said the team			0
with that in mind @entity62 , an @entity30 architecture company , created the @entity20 to protect the wearer from unwanted data collection			1
the @entity20 is a padded cloak that contains metallic fibres designed to block radio waves , shielding the wearer from tracking devices			1
all signals are designed to be blocked from reaching devices once they are stored inside the coat , meaning vital information from important items such as credit cards is protected from those looking to obtain it			2
this also means it is blocked from @entity83 networks , mobile providers and more			0
and with numerous pockets of different sizes the coat can accommodate smartphones , tablets and a range of other devices			1
the white coat is also patterned with black spots , which have been designed to mask the wearer ’s true body shape			2
you 're a ( tech ) wizard @entity2 : fans of @entity2 will be familiar with the fictional @entity3 ( pictured )			0
while this technology , if it were real , would block light waves to make it appear invisible , the @entity20 blocks radio waves to hide devices from @entity83 networks , mobile firms and other companies the @entity105 is a piece of clothing that enables its user to ' disappear ' , meaning ' @entity12 can not find you anymore ' according to the company			1
numerous pockets of different sizes ( pictured ) can hold smartphones , tablets and a range of other devices ' the @entity105 is a piece of clothing that enables its user to disappear : @entity12 can not find you anymore , ' said a spokesperson for @entity62			1
' the piece is made of metallised fabrics , which are blocking radio waves and shielding the wearer against tracking devices			1
' you are no longer reachable on your mobile phone and no information from your credit card can be captured			0
and they added : ' @entity131 pattern of the fabric gives an illusion of strange multiple body parts , which hides and frees the individual physicality			0
' @entity62 created the @entity105 for the @entity137 da lavoro exhibition , which takes place at the @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity141 , at the end of june 2014			1

@entity156 - *based* @entity62 have made a coat that stops radio waves
the @entity20 can be used to keep devices safe from prying eyes
while wearing the coat smartphones , tablets and more can not be tracked
this means companies would be unable to take data from the wearer
