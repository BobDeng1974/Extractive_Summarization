a scene on the issue had been originally written for the show in 1992 - but was a disaster when tested before an audience of pre-schoolers who misunderstood and became upset			2
the idea was shelved until this year - when writers came up with a slot featuring a fairy called @entity16 whose parents have been divorced for a while			1
the 13 - minute segment will be aired online today			1
when her friends @entity48 and @entity49 ask why @entity16 has two homes , the adult @entity46 explains to the muppets that : ' divorce means that @entity16 ’s mommy and daddy are n’t married anymore			1
' @entity16 adds that their divorce used to make her ' sad and mad ' but that things have become easier with time			1
the divorce rate in @entity59 is 50 per cent making it a common issue in young children 's lives			1
@entity64 , vp of @entity1 who has been with the show for 30 years , explained that from the very beginning , the team said that they would never talk down to children			0
divorce was first broached by writers and researchers in 1992			0
one day on @entity1 , the elephant character @entity74 tells @entity75 : ' my dad is moving out of our cave ... because of something called a divorce			1
' the scene was tested on pre-schoolers - to disastrous results			0
children panicked and did n't know where @entity74 would live and fretted that their own parents would get a divorce and not love them			0
brave decisions : in 2006 , @entity90 appeared in a @entity92 public service announcement alongside @entity93 , an @entity94 - positive character from @entity95 this time around , seasoned @entity1 writer @entity96 told @entity97 : ' writing about divorce is not easy			0
my approach was from the point of view of @entity16 whose parents have gone through a divorce in the past , so that it is not a new , raw emotion			1
' the 13 - minute segment appears as part of a multimedia project by @entity110 , the non-profit that operates @entity1			1
it also means that it is up to parents - depending on the family 's circumstances at the time - whether they want their children to see the divorce scene			2
current issues : a @entity1 episode in which @entity75 loses his home in a hurricane was re-aired in the wake of @entity124 the show has a history of courageously bringing up subjects that mr @entity64 admits ' sometimes you think you would n't want to touch with a 10ft pole '			0
in 2002 , @entity90 appeared in a @entity92 public service announcement alongside @entity93 , an @entity94 - positive character from @entity95 - @entity132 's version of the show			2
