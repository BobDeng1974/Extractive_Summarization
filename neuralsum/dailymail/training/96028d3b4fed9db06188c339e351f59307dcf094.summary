by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 15:20 est , 26 august 2013 thousands of @entity2 children whose schools were shuttered last spring walked to new ones on the first day of school today under the watchful eye of police officers			1
they were also joined by newly hired safety guards - there to provide protection as the kids crossed unfamiliar streets , many of them gang boundaries			1
no incidents of trouble were reported , police said			1
@entity18 patrol the neighborhood as @entity20 delivers her niece @entity21 from their south side home to @entity23 today a @entity2 police officer patrolling the neighborhood watches school children board a buss outside @entity27 while that did n't surprise parents and grandparents , they said they were still concerned that the city 's obvious show of first - day force wo n't keep their children safe in the weeks and months to come			1
' i think it 's just show - and - tell right now , ' said @entity37 , who walked her granddaughter , nine - year - old @entity21 , to @entity27 , which is about five blocks farther from home than @entity21 's previous south side school			0
' five , six weeks down the road , let 's see what 's going to happen			0
' @entity45 stood in front of @entity27 with her three children , waiting for a bus that would take them to another school			0
she scoffed at the @entity52 program , in which guards clad in neon vests line @entity2 streets , saying it wo n't be long before brightly colored signs announcing the program 's routes will be riddled with bullets			1
@entity37 , left , walks with her daughter @entity20 , right , and her granddaughter @entity21 to @entity23 in @entity2 thousands of students will walk newly designated @entity52 routes after @entity64 announced in may it would close about 50 schools and programs ' those signs do n't mean nothing , ' she said			1
the preparation and show of force shows what 's at stake for @entity64 , the nation 's third - largest school district , after it closed almost 50 schools last spring in the hopes of improving academic performance and saving millions of dollars			1
about 12,000 of the district 's 400,000 students were affected by the closures			2
for months , parents , teachers and community activists have warned that forcing children to pass through some of the city 's more impoverished and dangerous neighborhoods — where some already walking in the middle of the street to avoid being ambushed by gang members — to get to school puts them at undue risk			1
statistics suggest those concerns are valid			0
an analysis of @entity2 crime data by @entity98 found that in 2013 , there have been 133 shootings and 38 homicides in and around areas that have been newly marked as @entity52 routes			1
@entity18 patrol the neighborhood as children arrive at @entity23 @entity20 delivers her niece @entity21 to @entity23 on the first day of classes monday , aug. 26 and if the attention @entity2 received after a 15 - year - old honor student was killed about a mile from president @entity111 's home in january is any indication , there is no doubt a similar media firestorm will occur if a child is caught in gang crossfire on the way to or from school			2
one officer standing outside @entity27 summed up the pressure the police department and @entity123 are under this year , joking that children ' better not get a splinter or we 'll all be out of a job			0
' with the hope of preventing problems , the financially strapped city hired 600 workers at a rate of $ 10 an hour to supplement a @entity52 program that has existed since 2009 , — launched the same year a @entity2 honors student 's beating death was videotaped			1
police worked with residents and @entity64 to map out routes near 52 of the so - called ' welcoming schools ' that are taking in students from the closed schools			1
along those routes , the city has put up scores of ' @entity52 ' signs			2
mayor @entity145 also deployed city departments to repair sidewalks , replace street lights , paint over graffiti and board up nearly 300 abandoned buildings			0
on monday , @entity145 did n't mention @entity52 , focusing instead on changes that have been made for this school year , starting with a full day of kindergarten			1
but last week , he told about 1,000 people at a training session that the program is ' about more than just building a route to school			2
safety guard @entity158 high - fives @entity159 , 5 , as she heads to school ' it is about building a route to college , career and beyond ... ' he said			0
police superintendent @entity166 said monday he was pleased with how things were going , particularly in what he saw as evidence of community and parent involvement			0
' i 'm seeing small groups of kids being walked to school by their parents , or their older brothers or sisters , ' @entity166 told reporters			2
' this goes to the heart of what we 've been talking about since i 've been here , which is			0
to me , this is an opportunity			0
this is true community policing			0
' but crime statistics and shootings , like the one in the @entity191 neighborhood last week along a @entity52 route , only underline what parents say is a fact of life : danger lurks			1
' they will ride to school for the rest of their life , as long as i 'm in @entity2 , ' @entity198 said , explaining her determination to keep her kids out of harm 's way and from gangs from preying on them			2
she was at @entity27 to register her four - year - old daughter there because the pre-kindergarten class at a school closer to her home is full			0
for her part , nine - year - old @entity21 professed she was n't worried about all the gangs and the dangers of the streets that she 's heard her grandmother , @entity37 , and other grown - ups talk about — as long as her grandmother and aunt who walked with her to school are nearby			0
' i 'm going to be ok , as long as they 're with me , ' she said .			0
