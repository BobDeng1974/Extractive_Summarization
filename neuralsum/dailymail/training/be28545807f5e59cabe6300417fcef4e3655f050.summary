as the government 's austerity programme rolls on , and the @entity0 tightens its belt , @entity0 is a nation in need of something to smile about			0
and it seems a @entity8 pony moon - walking to the strains of an ' 80s pop tune could be just the thing			1
an advert for mobile internet firm 3 , which sees a pony tapping its hooves to everywhere by @entity16 , has been lauded as ' the best thing ever ' by fans on @entity19			1
' seeing the dancing pony advert brightens up my day , ' said @entity19 user @ _ 5ophie , while @ @entity32 tweeted that it would ' always be my favourite advert '			1
another fan , @ @entity35 _ , posted : ' love that dancing pony in the new 3 advert ' , adding ' it 'll probably be in a lasagne by next week though ' - referencing the recent horse meat scandal			1
today , @entity41 , the owner of @entity42 told of her pride			1
mrs @entity41 , 42 , who runs the @entity45 stud farm on @entity8 , said she was amazed at the five - year - old 's new found fame			1
he was even given the vip treatment during the shoot by having his own hairdresser who attached 40 clips to his locks for each day of filming			0
' brightens my day ' : one @entity19 user described the 3 advert as ' the best thing i 've ever seen ' baffled : a grey horse peers over a wall at the dancing pony in the quirky ad in the zone : the dancing @entity8 pony moon - walks to the edge of a cliff in the advert , which ends with the caption : ' @entity63 stuff			1
it matters ' mrs @entity41 was approached last year to supply the ponies for the advert , which was filmed on the cliffs of @entity73 on the islands			1
she said : ' the reaction has been incredible , we have had phone calls and emails from all over the world			0
i thought they did a terrific job with the advert and it was surreal watching it for the first time			0
' socks is a plucky pony who just loves attention and i think that 's why he was picked out to be the star			2
he spent a week filming the advert and he took it all in his stride			0
' it 's gone viral now with millions of people watching him but he is blissfully unaware and is keeping his hoofs firmly on the ground			2
' socks was prepared for his starring role for two weeks by local animal trainer @entity106 , who told how she taught him to ' moonwalk ' by giving him carrots as gifts			2
she said : ' since i only had two weeks in order to get socks ready to moonwalk , i had to work quickly to gain his trust			2
quirky : the advert has received over two million hits on @entity28 standing out in a crowd : the other @entity8 carry on grazing as the dancing pony moon - walks past ' i had to encourage him to go up on his rear legs as well - usually this is something that a trainer tries to get his horse or pony not to do , but because of the choreography of the ad , it was something we had to do			1
' in order to get him to paw the ground , which is probably one of the most important parts of the moonwalk process , i placed a facecloth to the ground that he would paw			0
' eventually , he would know to paw the ground without the facecloth being there			0
' the moonwalking @entity8 horse advert was filmed by award - winning filmmaker @entity149 , famed for his tear - jerking festive films for @entity151			2
local hairstylist @entity152 fitted socks with extensions and used luxury products on him for the shoot			0
one of mrs @entity41 's other ponies , @entity159 , also starred on the advert , which launched during @entity161 last week			2
however , she insisted that despite his fame she will not be cashing in by selling socks			0
she added : ' he has never been for sale and i wo n't be selling him no matter what the price			0
' he 's a very special little pony			0
' mash - up versions of the popular advert have also been cropping up on @entity28 , including one in which the @entity16 song has been replaced by @entity174 's @entity173 , and another which sees the pony trotting to the sounds of @entity178 by @entity179 .			1
