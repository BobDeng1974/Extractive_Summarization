the classic unsung hero , as @entity1 was described by former boss @entity2 recently , will now form one of the high notes of a celebratory @entity6 tune until the end of time after sending @entity9 ’s grafters on to glory			1
the @entity11 , 130 years and the outstanding @entity12 — who clinched the prize six minutes from time — are other key lyrics required to laud an achievement that has been so long in the making that it has tested the patience of hundreds of thousands of @entity20			1
but they wait no more to have gleaming silverware in @entity23 , while at @entity25 , the future remains bright for @entity27 ’s young stars of tomorrow			0
champions : @entity6 beat @entity27 2 - 0 to win the @entity29 on saturday joyous occasion : @entity12 ( right ) celebrates scoring in @entity6 's 2 - 0 @entity29 win full stretch : @entity12 ( right ) doubled @entity6 's lead in the 84th minute at @entity34 @entity6 : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity9 , @entity1 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 85 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 73 ) , @entity12 , may subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity41 , may , @entity12 goals : @entity51 84 @entity27 : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 77 ) , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 64 ) , @entity64 subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 booked : @entity57 , @entity55 , @entity71 attendance : 47,345 referee : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) the present , though , is absolutely dazzling for @entity20 ’ men of the moment at a club that runs as one of the steadiest operations in the otherwise madhouse arena that is @entity84 football			1
‘ may 17 ’ — the date and shirt number of @entity9 ’s star striker @entity88 — was supposed to be the @entity29 omen			0
but the victory signpost could actually be found on a film marked ‘ apr 19 ’			0
on that day last month , @entity1 opened the scoring with a back - post header as @entity6 beat @entity94 ’s side 2 - 0 — a third success against @entity27 on @entity97 business this term			1
as part of his planning for yesterday , @entity9 compiled a dvd for his team of the sort of goals typically conceded by the @entity25 defence			2
how that move paid off as the men from @entity23 worked the trick once more			0
perhaps it was fitting , after may had grabbed so much of the spotlight all season for his scoring heroics , that so many of the understated @entity20 shone at @entity34			1
manager @entity9 talked fondly of a photo he liked from the semi-final win over @entity116 at @entity117 that featured @entity1 , @entity38 , @entity118 and @entity36 celebrating after suffering so many last - four letdowns over the years			1
perhaps the snapshots of yesterday warrant a double take from some of these guys , just to confirm their @entity6 careers will be defined by this mighty triumph — and never again by near misses			1
it was deserved , too			0
although they were underdogs yesterday , @entity20 ’ victory was no great surprise			0
that ’s only one loss in the last nine meetings with @entity27			0
@entity9 had a disagreement with @entity94 on the touchline during @entity6 ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity25 in march but they were in accord over the deployment of @entity27 ’s teenage stars @entity63 and @entity139			1
up for it : @entity1 ( right ) pounced on @entity27 goalkeeper @entity52 ( left ) mistake to score wild scenes : @entity1 ( centre ) celebrates giving @entity6 the lead in their @entity11 triumph down and out : @entity27 players look crestfallen having conceded @entity1 's goal just before half - time the @entity150 ’s pre-match prediction was spot on as the youngsters began on the bench , while he stayed true to the team that won their semi-final			1
but it was n’t inexperience that cost @entity27			0
rather , a couple of dubious moments from goalkeeper @entity52 proved critical			0
and yet it was the @entity163 ’s counterpart , @entity35 , who betrayed signs of early nerves , spilling a @entity168 cross under pressure from @entity71			1
however , it was @entity6 who settled into a more assured stride			1
may wondered if @entity52 might be similarly jittery , taking speculative aim from distance but failing to trouble the keeper , who had warmed up by the time @entity178 tested him			2
the on - loan @entity180 man hit a shot from 22 yards after a @entity39 lay - off and @entity52 sprang to tip the shot over			1
the corner dropped into the path of @entity9 ’s late arrival into the box but the ball came off his shin and trickled into the arms of keeper			0
after being dumped for each of the last two @entity194 showpieces by @entity195 at @entity196 , @entity39 made the most of getting the call and he was quick to pounce on the @entity27 wall ’s deflection of a may free - kick			2
after cutting smartly inside @entity53 , @entity39 saw @entity52 deal well with a shot that took a nick off @entity55			0
the league ’s second - top scorers , @entity27 are never timid for long and at last came a killer delivery from @entity56			2
unbearable : a @entity27 fan puts his head in his hands during their 2 - 0 defeat to @entity6 @entity212 hit : @entity6 's @entity178 ( left ) battles @entity27 's @entity57 for the ball during the @entity29 close but no cigar : @entity71 ( left ) hit the bar for @entity27 with a second - half free - kick @entity60 ghosted in to offer a flick that bounded off the base of the far post and , to the delight of @entity35 , back into play before being cleared			1
@entity27 then claimed for handball against @entity39 as @entity55 tried to thread in @entity60			0
but minutes later , it was @entity39 who crafted the opening goal in first - half injury time			1
his corner convinced @entity52 to make a bone - headed break from his goal and come flapping for the ball			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , faked a run to clear himself of close policing and peeled away to rise and meet the cross six yards out			1
@entity53 was the nearest but helpless attendant as @entity1 nodded into the unguarded net			2
the @entity6 manager suspected @entity27 might be vulnerable to dead - ball deliveries in the air			1
little wonder , then , that he waved a clenched fist as he turned heels and darted for the team talk			0
@entity94 ’s was more succinct as his men emerged first after the interval hell - bent on a quick reply			1
that made for an increasingly combative second half			2
the 50th - minute drama provided the moment that must have convinced @entity20 fans that this would be their day			2
ecstasy : @entity6 players celebrate their first @entity255 win in their 130 - year history @entity71 , a bruising presence to front the @entity27 attack all afternoon , floated a free - kick over the wall			1
off the crossbar it came , the ball falling kinder than any @entity20 player could have dreamt of as it nestled cosily aside the grounded @entity35 when it could easily have cannoned off him and over the line			0
illegal means were then tried at the opposite end to do just that			0
@entity9 ’s free header guided the ball into the path of may , who appeared to be successfully bundling home a 28th goal of the season before @entity52 scrambled a save			2
may then used his hand for the final nudge			0
referee @entity74 initially awarded the goal , but the extra officials were bound to come in useful one of these years and @entity283 correctly snatched the celebrations back off the @entity20 fans			2
@entity39 at one end , then @entity56 at the other , were denied then the call for @entity63 came on 64 minutes , @entity289 making way			0
@entity38 was the shadow for @entity63 and the action passed the kid by			0
@entity295 viewing : @entity27 manager @entity94 watches on his team lose at @entity34 @entity58 was introduced to partner @entity71 and no one dug deeper than the @entity299 forward for an equaliser			1
no one went closer , either , than he did when rifling a low drive from 20 yards that skimmed the outside of @entity35 ’s right hand post			0
but it was the extra striker selection of @entity20 that proved the winner			0
@entity12 ’s hold - up play and knockdowns had been a fine feature all day and , six minutes from time , he shot into centre stage			1
a may crossfield pass took a wild deflection and , as @entity12 slid in with @entity52 , the first crunching contact was a draw			2
the second scramble for possession quickly saw the striker hook his foot around the ball and steer it into the empty net			0
@entity12 stripped off his top as he wheeled away to greet the acclaim of the @entity23 fans and earned the happiest booking of his life			2
@entity58 missed a chance to make it nervy at the death with a free header			0
so , 20 years since @entity330 stopped a string of @entity194 horror stories for @entity27 , @entity6 legends were at last created from the dramas of this @entity255 .			1

@entity1 and @entity12 goals seal @entity6 's first - ever @entity255 win in their 130 - year history
@entity1 put @entity341 side in front in first half injury time
@entity12 doubled @entity6 's lead in the second half at @entity34
@entity168 and @entity71 both hit the frame of the goal for @entity94 's side either side of half - time
