@entity0 beat her businessman boyfriend so severely , he almost lost his arm and will need cosmetic surgery to heal his scars			1
( pictured outside @entity5 in 2008 ) this is the first picture of 5ft 1in @entity0 , who beat her businessman boyfriend so severely that he almost lost his arm and will need cosmetic surgery to heal his horrific scars			1
@entity9 , 49 , from @entity10 , suffered two years of abuse at the hands of his girlfriend , including one attack where she sprayed bleach in his eyes			1
he also suffered fractures to his skull , cheekbones , and nose , three cracked ribs and horrific burns on his arm from an iron at the hands of his ex-girlfriend			1
@entity0 , who is now serving a seven - year jail sentence for causing grievous bodily harm , also lit cigarettes and shoved them up her partner ’s nose after falsely accusing him of having an affair			1
on one occasion , she also poured two kettles full of boiling water over him - and even attacked him with a vacuum cleaner			2
@entity9 , who is now preparing for the surgery , said : ' it was between @entity41 and @entity42 ( in 2006 ) when she first accused me of having an affair with one of her friends			1
' this was the first time she lashed out			2
' she punched me in the face and i had a black eye			2
' @entity0 begged him for forgiveness , saying it was just a one - off and soon moved into his flat in @entity5			1
however a few weeks later she launched another attack with the vacuum cleaner			2
@entity9 recalled : ' she began ranting and raving about previous partners of mine			1
' then , all of a sudden , she switched the vacuum cleaner off , grabbed the nozzle and whacked me across the face with it			2
i could feel my cheek split			0
' this was the first of many outbursts of domestic violence from the then 34 - year - old and the attacks got progressively worse			2
his worst ordeal came when @entity0 poured a kettle full of boiling water into his lap and , while he was screaming in agony , she reboiled the kettle and poured it over him again			1
he continued : ' she would show off my injuries to her friends			0
' i felt as though i could n’t walk away , because she told me she had family who were involved in organised crime who would kill me if i left her			0
' i felt i was trading with my life			0
i was brought up well and taught never to hit a woman - and i did n’t lay a finger on her			0
' the night before @entity0 ’s arrest , mr @entity9 endured an attack that lasted almost seven hours , where he was beaten with a metal bar and his body smashed in places with a claw hammer			1
an anonymous phone call tipped off the police , who took him to @entity96 and arrested @entity0			1
although the violence had come to an end , mr @entity9 did n’t realise the aftermath would be just as bad			1
he woke up the following day to find himself in a night shelter for the homeless , wearing his bloodstained clothes from the day before			0
injuries : among @entity9 's injuries were fractures to his skull , cheekbones , and nose			1
right , he shows damage to his shoulder that was caused by a hammer attack @entity9 , 49 , from @entity10 , shows a scar on his arm caused by an iron he said : ' @entity0 had taken control of my finances and run up lots of debt			1
i did n’t have any money and did n’t know where to go or what to do			0
' i was petrified walking the streets of @entity10 , as i was paranoid her brothers were going to come and kill me			0
as it turns out , they did n’t exist , but i did n’t know that at the time			0
' after a phone call to the @entity130 , he was given accommodation at @entity132 , where he stayed for 18 months , and he received psychological help and support from @entity135			0
now , mr @entity9 has dedicated his life to helping the homeless - being appointed vice-chairman of @entity10 ’s @entity138			2
he added : ' i can completely understand why some men will feel embarrassed speaking out - men generally do n’t like talking about their feelings			0
' but the bigger issue is that lots of men do n’t know where to go for help and there ’s a lot of gender bias			0
' the massive problem is that men are not seen as victims			0
' we need a gender neutral awareness campaign , or even a male - specific one			0
' despite his experience , @entity9 is n’t put off having a relationship again			1
' it ’s going to be difficult when i meet someone who does n’t know what i ’ve been through , ' said @entity9			2
' they will no doubt ask about my scars , and i ’m not going to lie			0
' my fear is that they will wonder what i did to deserve it			0
