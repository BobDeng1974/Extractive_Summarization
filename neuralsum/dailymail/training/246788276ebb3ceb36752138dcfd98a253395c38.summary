by @entity0 published : 10:08 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 02:13 est , 15 august 2012 the military officer in charge of planning for the @entity4 has warned that it could take two years for the armed forces to recover from the burden of deploying extra troops at the @entity4			1
wing commander @entity9 also said the @entity4 showed that the forces needed to be large enough to respond to emergencies			1
his comments come after thousands of troops were drafted in to plug gaps left by private firm @entity15 , which failed to provide enough security guards to protect @entity4 venues			1
duty : it will take the armed forces two years to recover after extra personnel were deployed to the @entity4 , a senior military officer has claimed they are likely to be interpreted as a veiled attack on politicians who seek to cut the size of the military to save money			1
@entity29 said : ' it just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down			1
' the senior officer said the deployment of extra officers had been a ' game changer ' that had a major impact on the armed forces			1
' we were originally planning to provide niche capabilities , ' he told the @entity42			2
' when the requirement for venue security was doubled , that was a bit of a game changer			1
royal support : prince @entity48 speaks to members of the @entity51 guards on security duty at the @entity4 rowing events ' we had to generate 18,000 people			1
that does not mean that there are 18,000 spare people			0
it means that the government has prioritised ( the @entity4 )			2
' it will take two years to recover from this , to get back to normal , to get everything back into kilter			0
' you ca n’t expect them to go back to normal routine very easily			0
' @entity15 had a contract to provide 10,400 guards for the @entity4 , but @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 personnel had to step in after it failed to meet its targets			1
some 3,500 troops were committed initially , but the government had to draft in a further 1,200 as the opening ceremony approached			2
guarding the @entity4 : soldiers like these at the @entity79 were forced to plug gaps left by private firm @entity15 , which failed to provide enough security guards wing @entity29 said the @entity4 showed ' the country needs a military for more than war fighting '			1
he added : ' it just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down			1
i am sure that there are some people who think that if we are a smaller military power we will be less likely to get involved in international operations			0
' if we shrink the military , do we really understand what we are losing ? ' look at the speed with which we pushed up the throttle			0
it proves the military offers the country a huge amount of resilience			0
' defence secretary @entity104 said the failure by @entity15 to meet the security requirements illustrated the different approaches taken in the private and public sector			1
' i still think that , in general , there ’s a lot that the public sector still has to learn from the way private sector does things , ' he told the @entity116			0
' but , the story of @entity15 and the military rescue is quite informative because as two models of how to approach a problem you could not get two greater extremes than the @entity15 model and the military model			1
' the @entity15 model says here is a cost envelope within which i have to deliver an outcome and therefore i have to do it incredibly leanly			2
' i have to do it with very little resilience			0
so @entity15 were literally hiring people and expecting to deploy them three days later , into a live situation ; trying to build up a management structure overnight , at the beginning of the operation			2
team : @entity70 and @entity71 personnel have been working together at the @entity139 in @entity140 , east @entity141 ' a very lean structure , with lots of dependence on self - motivation by the people in the workforce ; scheduling their own shifts , for example , by accessing an internet site			0
' the military comes at it from the exact opposite extreme			0
what ’s the job that needs to be done ? ' ok , we ’ll do it			0
whatever it takes we ’ll pour in massive over-resourcing , massively heavy structures of management			0
' mr @entity104 added : ' what the military primarily deliver is contingent capability and i have n’t been able to think of a single large - scale example where a private organisation delivers a contingent capability			2
' you pay for it , year in , year out , but you probably never use it for what it ’s designed for			0
' ready for action : @entity175 , the largest active ship in the @entity71 sails down the @entity177 at @entity178 , as part of a pre-olympics security exercise poised : a crew member stands guard next to a mounted gun as @entity71 helicopter carrier @entity175 passes @entity185 during security rehearsals a @entity188 spokesman said : ' the defence contribution to the @entity4 was always planned to avoid an impact on current operations			1
' so , while some individual training and leave may need to be rescheduled , this will be managed and will not impact on operations including the ongoing mission in @entity197			0
' given the scale and importance of this once in a generation event , including the forthcoming @entity203 , it is right that all across government play a part in ensuring the success of the @entity4			2
' this includes the armed forces who have done a fantastic job while continuing to deliver on other standing tasks and duties			1
' police officers claimed that the @entity15 debacle showed that the involvement of private firms in policing carried risks			1
@entity220 chairman @entity219 urged home secretary @entity221 to ' think long and hard before handing over the public sector crown jewels to the highest bidder '			0
taking aim : trained @entity72 snipers were involved in the effort to ensure the @entity4 were held safely ' @entity229 has raised concerns many times over the reliance of private industry in areas such as policing , ' he said			1
' what the @entity15 debacle has shown is that we were right to be concerned			2
' it is good to see that the @entity240 has come out fighting for our troops , and is now reconsidering there are limits to what private industry can do			2
' the federation 's national vice-chairman , @entity246 said : ' domestic security must be undertaken by public servants - men and women who are fully trained and accountable for their actions			0
' this is what the public want and what the public deserve			0
' privatisation of policing provides no benefit to the public , delivers a detrimental service to local communities and arguably , if the police then end up stepping in again when private firms fail to deliver , an additional cost to the taxpayer			0
' defence : @entity72 @entity268 based at @entity269 provided air cover for the @entity141 area during the @entity4 crucial : @entity72 personnel have played an important role in the @entity4 security operation			1

wing commander @entity9 says the need for extra troops was a ' game changer ' for the military
he warns against further cuts to the armed forces , adding : ' it just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down '
thousands of extra troops were deployed to @entity4 venues after private firm @entity15 failed to provide enough security guards
