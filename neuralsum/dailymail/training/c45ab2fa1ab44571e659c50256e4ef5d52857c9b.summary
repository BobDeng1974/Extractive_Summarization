a heartbroken dog whose owner died two months ago is missing her so much he is attending services at the @entity6 church where her funeral was held patiently waiting for her to return			2
@entity8 , a seven - year - old @entity9 , belonged to @entity10 , 57 , and had been her faithful companion after she adopted him when she found him abandoned in fields close to her home			1
mrs @entity10 adopted several strays she found but friends said she developed a particular close affection for @entity8 and would walk to church with him from her home every day - where the priest would allow him to sit patiently by her feet			1
pining : @entity8 the @entity9 waits faithfully during @entity22 at the church where his owner @entity10 's funeral was held following her death at @entity28 near @entity29 , a funeral service was held at which @entity8 joined mourners and since then he has been a regular at the church arriving on time when the bells ring out to mark the start of services			1
father @entity37 said : '' he 's there every time i celebrate @entity22 and is very well behaved - he does n't make a sound , i 've not heard one bark from him in all the time he has been coming in			2
' he used to come to @entity22 with @entity10 and he was obviously devoted to her - i let him stay inside as he was always so well behaved and none of the other parishoners ever complained to me			0
' he 's still coming to @entity22 even after @entity10 's funeral , he waits patiently by the side of the altar and just sits there quietly			0
i did n't have the heart to throw him out - i 've just recently lost my own dog so i leave him there until @entity22 finishes and then i let him out			0
sad : @entity53 , a seven year old @entity55 shepherd , had been adopted by @entity10 , 57 , after she found him wandering fields behind her house in @entity28 near @entity29 , @entity6 routine : @entity8 and @entity10 would walk to church together every day - where the priest would allow him to sit patiently by her feet ' @entity8 's been adopted by everyone in the village now and he is everybody 's friend			1
everyone looks out for him and leaves food for him - although it would be nice to find a proper home for him			0
' the story of @entity8 is similar to the 2009 @entity70 blockbuster @entity71 starring @entity72 which told of how a faithful @entity74 dog waits patiently for his master after he also dies			2
it was based on the true story of a @entity78 @entity74 called @entity79 , whose owner died in 1925 but for the next nine years he waited patiently at a railway station for his owner from where they regularly caught a train .			0

@entity8 , a @entity55 shepherd , had been adopted by @entity88 as a stray
he would accompany her to church everyday and sit at her feet
