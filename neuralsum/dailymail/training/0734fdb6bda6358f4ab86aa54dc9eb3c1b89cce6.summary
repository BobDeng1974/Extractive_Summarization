for all the change that @entity3 wealth has brought to @entity4 , one thing remained the same : they could n’t buy a win on @entity7			2
not since the day before @entity9 ’s takeover in the summer of 2008 had @entity4 tasted victory at the @entity11			1
one of the @entity13 ’s more peculiar statistics had seen them suffer four consecutive 1 - 0 defeats here before this game			0
it was just one of those quirky things that football throws up sometimes			0
@entity24 cost £ 38m but , as he continues to justify comparisons with @entity89 and his close friend @entity90 , the @entity87 striker looks like an absolute steal			2
@entity24 scored two goals — one a blockbuster — and set up another			1
the @entity13 ’s top scorer now has 19 goals in all competitions this season			0
manager @entity98 , who has now overseen four straight wins in all competitions , said : ‘ finally we win here			2
we played very well and we ’re returning to the form we had last season			0
’ @entity98 confirmed that captain @entity105 has only an outside chance of making next week ’s @entity108 decider against @entity109 following scans on his hamstring			2
in the absence of @entity105 and the suspended @entity114 , @entity48 made his first @entity13 appearance in a year			0
@entity35 opens the scoring in the 19th minute as he beats @entity4 's defence to poke @entity33 's cross beyond @entity46 @entity37 climbs onto @entity35 's shoulders as the pair celebrate taking the lead against @entity4 @entity24 pulls the trigger and blasts his shot towards @entity26 's goal the @entity127 striker 's shot had too much power for the @entity130 keeper to handle @entity131 ( right ) rises to his feet as @entity24 's celebrations commence @entity23 boss @entity134 also made a switch in central defence as he rested @entity41 and gave @entity29 his first @entity13 start since arriving on loan from @entity139 in the summer			1
both changes contributed to two goals in the space of three first - half minutes			2
@entity23 had been the only team to really threaten up to that point when @entity47 blocked an effort from former @entity4 midfielder @entity34			1
@entity47 was not so fortunate in the 19th minute as @entity35 — who terrorised @entity4 with both goals in a 2 - 2 draw at the @entity148 in april that almost cost them the title — opened the scoring			1
@entity48 had lost track of his man when @entity33 ’s clever reverse pass picked out @entity35 , who took it in his stride with a neat first touch			1
there was still plenty of work to do with @entity48 on one shoulder , @entity47 on the other and @entity46 racing off his line			0
@entity47 made a last , desperate attempt to win the ball with a sliding tackle but only succeeded in playing it against @entity35 ’s right leg and it bobbled past @entity46 into the corner			1
@entity23 's @entity37 ( second left ) is denied a chance on goal by @entity4 defender @entity49 @entity56 unleashes his left - footed shot to put @entity4 in the lead at the @entity11 @entity56 's shot ends almost directly behind 6ft 8in keeper @entity26 as @entity4 go up 2 - 1 @entity56 points out his provider @entity24 after finishing off a slick build - up from @entity4 @entity24 ( left ) and @entity56 ( right ) celebrate as their combination puts @entity4 in the lead @entity181 is well within our grasp - @entity24 @entity23 1 , @entity4 0 had a horribly familiar ring about it for the champions , but they rallied and were level almost straightaway			1
@entity29 will not want to see too many replays of the equaliser , however			0
@entity24 appeared to have lost control of the ball when he took an uncharacteristically heavy touch to collect @entity56 ’s short pass , but @entity29 hesitated rather than committing himself to a challenge			1
the @entity4 striker slipped the ball through the @entity196 ’s legs and suddenly had a clear sight of goal from 20 yards			2
ex-city keeper @entity26 must have known what was coming next , but the strike was stunning in its ferocity even by @entity24 ’s standards — flying into the net off his right boot			1
having demonstrated his power , @entity24 then produced some quite wonderful panache to set up the second for @entity56 six minutes before half time			1
@entity208 drilled a pass into his teammate , who was being closely marshalled by @entity29 and @entity211			0
@entity4 right back @entity47 celebrates his second half goal , @entity4 's third , with a gesture to his pregnant wife @entity214 @entity47 married long - time girlfriend @entity214 , from @entity216 , in the summer and the couple are due to have a baby @entity47 waits for @entity26 to go down and calmly dinks his shot over the keeper for a finish any striker would be delighted with unfortunately for @entity23 , that meant @entity56 was unmarked and @entity24 knew it			1
he used the weight of the pass to spin the ball into his teammate ’s path with a flick of his right foot			0
@entity56 let it bounce once and then rifled it through @entity131 ’s legs			0
the gulf in class between the two teams was clear again when @entity47 got @entity4 ’s third 10 minutes into the second half			1
@entity238 stood off his man as @entity54 teased the defender on the righthand side of the box before cheekily lifting the ball into the path of @entity47			2
the @entity87 defender then produced an even better touch , dinking the ball over @entity26 and just inside the post			0
@entity47 celebrated the news that his wife is five months pregnant by putting the ball up his shirt and sucking his thumb like a dummy			0
the jeers from the @entity23 supporters suggested they did not share his joy at that particular moment			0
but this was the @entity24 show and he struck again in the 71st minute , getting away from @entity27 to meet @entity57 ’s pass and guide it past @entity26 for his second and @entity4 ’s fourth			1
‘ i was hoping @entity24 would have a rest today , ’ lamented @entity134			0
‘ without him , it would have been a different game			0
‘ the striker was substituted soon after scoring his second and no wonder			0
on this form , @entity4 must protect @entity24 like the @entity267			2
the ball clears the giant keeper as @entity23 captain @entity28 fails to intervene in time to stop the defender @entity24 celebrates his second goal of the night before soon after being substituted for @entity58 @entity98 warmly greets @entity24 as his star striker is replaced in the 74th minute @entity274 's attempt to come to the rescue - perhaps - ended with his expulsion from the ground			1

@entity35 finished off @entity33 's cross to give @entity23 the lead in the 19th minute
@entity24 hit back for @entity4 two minutes later with a powerful finish for his first of two goals
@entity24 's goal was the first time @entity4 have found the net at the @entity11 since march 2010
@entity56 gave @entity4 the lead in the 39th minute after being set up by his *prolific* strike partner @entity24
@entity47 gave @entity98 's side a two - goal buffer with a classy dink over @entity26 for the third
