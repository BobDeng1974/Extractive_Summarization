@entity0 is a name @entity2 wo n't forget in a hurry and he might just stick around in a few other memories after the way he led @entity6 to a win over @entity8 on sunday			1
to followers of @entity11 , the only surprise is that it 's taken this long for @entity0 to draw wider attention			1
for years the @entity15 has been hyped as a future star , but so far has only fleetingly lived up to the predictions			0
here , @entity18 offers a guide to the flying winger … @entity0 ( left ) gave @entity8 defender @entity2 ( right ) a torrid afternoon on sunday not bad against @entity8 , was he ? he was devastating – the most effective player on the pitch			1
he was helped by @entity2 ' fatigue , but capitalised to give the 19 - year - old right back an awful time			1
long before he set up @entity29 's winner , it was obvious that @entity6 's plan was to get him on the ball and running at @entity32			1
it was a brutal mismatch			0
tell us about him … he 's @entity15 and turned 25 last month having joined @entity6 in the summer from @entity37 club @entity36 for roughly £ 4million			1
interestingly , he was actually close to joining @entity38 a year ago			0
@entity39 ( centre ) provided the assist for @entity29 's goal , which proved to be the winner against @entity8 so this is his big break ? not really			1
he 's been about a bit , including three years in @entity47 , so this is n't his first taste of life in a big league			0
he started at @entity52 in the @entity15 top flight in 2007 , before joining @entity54 , whom he left for a brief loan spell at @entity57 in @entity37			2
he joined @entity58 in 2009 but struggled in @entity47			2
he was often understudy to @entity59 and was sent out on loan to @entity61 and @entity62			0
he was a key part of the @entity65 - led @entity62 squad , but returned to @entity37 in 2012 to join @entity36 , where he won the @entity66 : @entity67 2013			2
@entity0 ( left ) featured in all three games for @entity69 during their @entity71 campaign in @entity72 so he 's been around			1
and he was at the @entity71 as well , right ? yes			1
he played all three of @entity69 's games in @entity72 as they finished third in @entity75 made his @entity69 debut in 2007 , aged 18 , and was part of the side that won the @entity79 that year – @entity69 's first international trophy			1
he has played 48 games for the national side , scoring eight			0
what 's his style ? as you saw on sunday , he is rapid and an old - school , touchline - hugging left winger , yet a natural right footer			1
he can play on either flank but tends to be used on the left , even if that does mean he occasionally slows moves down by cutting inside			2
his pace is certainly his main weapon			0
at @entity6 there are numerous speedsters – @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 ( on loan at @entity101 ) are all very quick			1
but @entity0 is believed by many at the club to be quickest of all			2
he loves to run at players but despite his excellence against @entity32 his final ball has not always impressed since he arrived in @entity108			0
@entity0 ( centre ) has been an essential component in the @entity6 team that is fifth in the @entity112 how has he settled in ? at 5ft 7ins , he fits in perfectly with @entity97 in the sense that he is small and quick			1
but he has not been a first - choice starter by any means , with @entity97 and @entity98 get far more game time			2
he did n't start a @entity112 game until the win over @entity119 on october 25			0
in fact , the win over @entity8 was only his third league start , but crucially his third in succession			2
he seems to have broken through , even if @entity125 did reveal on sunday that @entity97 and @entity98 have injuries			0
his other eight league appearances have come from the bench , typically after 65 minutes , but started all three of their @entity130 games			0
any other standout performances ? yes			0
no - one who was there will forget the mauling he gave @entity137 's @entity136 in @entity6 's cup win in september			1
and within moments of coming off the bench against @entity141 in the first game of the season he made the winning goal			0
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates as @entity146 ( centre ) equalises for @entity6 against @entity8 on sunday @entity0 will now be looking to score his first goal in @entity6 colours since his summer transfer there is no doubting that there are currently limitations to @entity0 's game – he is also yet to score for @entity6 - but if he goes against a vulnerable full - back who ca n't match his pace , it 's brutal			1
what next ? he will be hoping to retain his form and place after the international break			0
@entity97 will be back in training this week and @entity98 wo n't train for seven or so days , but should be back after the international break			0
it will be interesting to see if @entity165 sticks with him when he has all his aces available and rested .			0

@entity0 gave @entity8 defender @entity2 a torrid game
the @entity69 *attacker* joined @entity6 in the summer after the @entity71
he mainly plays on the left wing , despite being naturally right - footed
