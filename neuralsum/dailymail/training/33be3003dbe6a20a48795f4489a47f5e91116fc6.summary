former @entity1 manager @entity0 is here in @entity3 as co-commentator for @entity6 tv station @entity5			2
he covered @entity8 ’s opening game against @entity9 last week and here is his guide to @entity13 ’s next opponents			1
nine of the players who started against @entity31 in @entity32 were on the field when they met @entity9			2
but , oh , what a difference			2
not in one area of the pitch did @entity8 play well in this game			1
it seems because they are older many of them are now slower			2
@entity42 and @entity43 are not the players they were , for sure			2
@entity13 can win this game			1
they just need to be conscious of certain things			0
beware the counter-attack danger men : @entity42 and @entity50 ( pictured ) , along with @entity51 will pose @entity8 's threat this is where @entity8 are at their most dangerous , and it is how they like to play			1
particularly up front where @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity42 enjoy playing in the space which that kind of approach gives them			1
i think they prefer to go into games as the underdogs			0
because they were expected to beat @entity9 , i think the situation got the better of them			0
@entity68 : @entity50 @entity69 is the key if the @entity13 team that is being discussed is the one @entity72 opts for then they will boast one of the quickest attacks in the tournament			1
@entity21 and @entity79 on the wings , @entity78 behind @entity17 ; this is a forward line that can inflict real damage against @entity8			1
secret to success : @entity79 and @entity78 can hurt @entity8 they need to look at how @entity85 destroyed them			1
i told @entity88 that @entity85 played very well ; he should be back at @entity90 for next season			0
@entity92 , who is set to come in for the suspended @entity93 , has been struggling with injury			2
@entity79 and @entity21 need to have confidence to run at the full - backs			1
@entity98 battle zone this is where @entity8 were most disappointing			1
@entity101 and @entity102 were very poor indeed			0
it was like they did n’t want the ball			0
personally , and i will be accused of @entity1 bias here , i would be tempted to play @entity110 with @entity14 against them			0
then you would have two players who could play those balls behind them			0
even so , i believe @entity13 can dominate this area of the field			1
going with experience : @entity110 should come into @entity13 's engine room @entity13 ’s defence this tournament has interested me because so many teams are playing three at the back			1
@entity31 , @entity125 , @entity9 and @entity126			0
@entity127 played this way too in winning the @entity130 title this year			0
as did @entity3 when they won the @entity28 in 2002			0
although they had two great full - backs in @entity134 and @entity135 back then ! the @entity137 defence is a bit of a worry for me			0
personally , i may have taken @entity141 and @entity142			0
so @entity143 and @entity144 need to be at their best , even if i can not believe that @entity50 is really 100 per cent fit when he has been injured			1
tall order : @entity13 defender @entity143 has his work cut out like i said , it is as a counter-attacking team that @entity8 are at their most dangerous			1
i suspect @entity50 will replace @entity42			1
the former @entity152 player is no longer the force he was			0
but i wonder what threat @entity8 can pose on the flanks			1
@entity156 and @entity157 offered little against @entity9			0
that said , they can not play that badly again			0
i just can not see them beating @entity13			2
on the contrary , @entity13 will win if they attack with the same purpose they showed against @entity164			2
expert analysis : @entity0 is commentating on the @entity28 for @entity6 tv			0

@entity78 , @entity17 , @entity79 and @entity21 can cause damage for @entity13
@entity8 are dangerous on the counter-attack but they are struggling with *weight* of expectation on their shoulders
@entity144 and @entity143 must be on top form to stop @entity50
