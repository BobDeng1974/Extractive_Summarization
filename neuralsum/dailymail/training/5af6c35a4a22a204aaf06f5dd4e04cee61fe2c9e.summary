mr @entity1 and his co-host @entity5 caused international uproar on december 4 when they pretended to be prince @entity8 and the @entity9 and were put through to the @entity11 's ward at the @entity12			1

back on the air : @entity1 ( right ) and his co-host @entity5 caused international uproar on december 4 when they pretended to be prince @entity8 and the @entity9 after giving a tearful tv interview later , when they expressed their sorrow at the consequences of their hoax call , nothing was heard of the pair – until today , when mr @entity1 's voice was heard on his original radio station , @entity38 's @entity37 , which is part of the @entity41 network			1
the company was quick to deny that it had arranged for mr @entity1 to ' sneak ' back on air			1
' i do n't think the organisation was trying to hide anything , ' a spokeswoman told @entity38 's @entity49 newspaper			1
' his return was never going to be the subject of a bells and whistles - type announcement			0
' nothing has been heard of @entity57 , 30 , and no announcement has been made when , or if , she will return to the air waves			2
tragic : @entity13 , 46 , of @entity60 , the nurse who transferred the call to @entity11 's ward , was found dead in nurses ' housing three days after the call when the pair gave their tv interview in the wake of miss @entity71 's suicide , miss @entity57 appeared to be more upset than mr @entity1			1
through her tears she said : ' i remember my first question was " was she a mother ? " she added : ' there 's not a minute that goes by that we do n't think about her family and what they must be going through			2
' and the thought we may have played a part in that is gut - wrenching			0
' both djs declared they would be happy to help with any investigation by @entity23			0
however , @entity91 's @entity90 said earlier this month that there was no evidence to support a manslaughter charge			0
the network said that while the couple 's show , @entity97 30 , had been axed , the company was looking at them ' returning to work when the time is right in roles that make full use of their talents '			0
now mr @entity1 has made his first appearance in the wake of the scandal , continuing with his announcements without any reference to past events			2
mr @entity110 , the company 's chief executive officer , said : ' we are happy to have @entity1 back on air			1
' we have always supported our talent returning to work when appropriate and today marks that occasion for @entity116			0
' we look forward to welcoming @entity5 back when the time is right			2

@entity123 and @entity11 pictured leaving the king edward vii hospital shortly after she received treatment for morning sickness miss @entity57 said in an interview after the death : ' there ’s not a minute that goes by that we do n’t think about her family and what they must be going through			0
' the @entity88 spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were ' gutted , shattered and heartbroken '			0
in two emotional and often tearful interviews , @entity5 and @entity1 offered their apologies to the family of @entity13 , but insisted that it had been a ' harmless prank ' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy			1
recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse 's death , sobbing @entity57 , 30 , said : ' i remember my first question was , “ was she a mother ? ” ... it was the worst phone call i have ever had in my life			1
' there 's not a minute that goes by that we do n't think about her family and what they must be going through			2
and the thought we may have played a part in that is gut - wrenching			0
' mr @entity1 , 25 , who had joined the @entity20 - based radio station only weeks earlier , said : ' our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected			1
' obviously @entity5 and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what 's happened			1
' we hope that they [ mrs @entity71 's family ] are doing ok and they 're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now			0
