by @entity0 murdered : @entity1 was killed in 1999 the shooting of @entity1 on her doorstep remains one of @entity6 ’s enduring murder mysteries			1
but after 14 years , @entity7 has abandoned any hope of finding who killed the popular tv presenter			1
the admission comes after one of the highest - profile police investigations in modern times and a ground - breaking £ 587,000 review of the case by the forensics firm which helped crack the murder of @entity19			2

forensic experts subjected dozens of scenes of crime exhibits , including miss @entity1 ’s clothing , to state - of - the - art tests			2
according to a number of sources , the possibility of a forensic breakthrough was hampered by what happened after @entity53 was blasted in the head at point - blank range			0
