@entity0 are ready to rise to the challenge of facing a @entity3 side managed for the first time by @entity5 , according to defender @entity6			1
the @entity3 travel to @entity7 on saturday evening just one point and one place outside of the @entity11 relegation zone , having sacked @entity12 after last weekend 's 4 - 0 home defeat to @entity14			1
@entity5 has been appointed until the end of the season with the aim of keeping the club in the top flight , and @entity20 - a @entity11 ever - present for @entity0 so far this campaign - knows the game takes on extra significance following the @entity25 's appointment			1
@entity6 ( right ) says @entity0 are ready to face @entity3 on saturday evening @entity6 admits it will be tough facing a team who have just appointed a new manager ' what was already set to be a tough but exciting game has that bit more to it now @entity3 have brought a new manager in , ' he told @entity0 's official website			1
' i do n't know too much about @entity5 but he 's certainly got a lot of experience and we 're expecting a difficult match			1
every game in the @entity11 is a challenge and we will have to rise to it			2
' when a new manager comes in it gives everyone at the club a lift and the players will want to impress the new manager			0
' the first game under a new manager seems to favour the team with the new manager and i certainly think that was the case when we played @entity54 on @entity55 just after @entity56 had taken over			0
' @entity5 has taken over at @entity3 until the end of the season @entity5 takes charge of the @entity3 for the first time away at @entity0 on saturday evening although @entity5 will want a positive result in his first game in charge , the fixture is also crucial to @entity0 and their manager @entity65			1
following an impressive start , @entity65 has seen his side fall away from the pack chasing @entity70 qualification with the @entity0 having won just one of their last 12 league games			2
in that spell they have come up against @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 but , of their final nine league outings , only two come against sides in the top half			0
' we 've had a tough run of fixtures recently and while no game is easy in the @entity11 , some are harder than others , ' @entity6 added			2
' having played all the top clubs in the last two months , we know that we have a fair few winnable games in our last nine games so i firmly believe we can finish strongly			0
' we have n't had the results that we feel our performances deserve so we need to work that bit harder to make sure we get what our performances merit			0
no one at the club wants the season to fade away and we want to finish as high as we can			0
