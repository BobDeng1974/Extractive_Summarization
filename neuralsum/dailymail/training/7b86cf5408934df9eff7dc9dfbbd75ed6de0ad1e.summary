scientists have found a way to make a decayed tooth repair itself , using a laser beam if you hate going to the dentist , this may bring a smile of relief to your face			1
for scientists have found a way to make a decayed tooth repair itself , using a laser beam			1
the breakthrough could mean many patients will no longer need painful and costly treatment			1
as well as making trips to the dentist a lot more pleasant , it could also see dentures bite the dust			0
just a five minute blast from a laser was enough to kick - start the healing process inside the mouth , researchers found			2
while the experiments were on rats , the team – which included experts from the @entity31 government ’s dental research arm – hope to test the technique on people soon			2
they began by making a small hole in the dentine , the hard core of the tooth that often rots away			2
they then shone a low - power laser on the tooth for five minutes			2
twelve weeks later , new dentin had formed , the journal @entity44 reports			0
further experiments revealed what lay behind the laser ’s healing effect			0
the blast of intense light activated a chemical in the mouth which ‘ woke up ’ stem cells – master cells which act as a repair system for the body – deep within the tooth			1
these stem cells were then able to form new dentine			1
scientists have managed to make an entire living tooth before but previous work has been done in a dish in a lab. the new technique should be better , as the repair is done in the mouth and uses the body ’s natural processes			1
researcher @entity71 , of the @entity72 in @entity73 , said that if other parts of the tooth can also be regenerated , the technique might replace painful and expensive root canal treatment			1
being able to do major repairs to rotten teeth in this way would also mean fewer dentures , which are not as good for oral health as living teeth , which provide a more natural bite			0
the repairs would also have massive psychological benefits for patients self - conscious about their smile			0
the breakthrough could mean many patients will no longer need painful and costly treatment unfortunately for those who fear the dentist ’s drill , fillings would still be necessary for some types of decay			1
dr @entity71 , a dentist , hopes to test the technique on people soon			0
professor @entity99 , an expert in regenerative medicine from @entity101 , said : ‘ i think it would be popular with patients because it would be low - cost and rapid and involve minimal surgery			2
it would also be popular with the health care providers who have to foot the bill			0
’ however , he cautioned that regrowing the enamel , the hard surface of the tooth that allows us to bite and chew food , will be much more difficult			0
‘ it ’s a great start but ultimately you ’d want to have enamel too , ’ he said .			0

laser beams can make a decayed tooth repair itself , say @entity31 scientists
intense light activated a chemical in mouth which ‘ woke up ’ stem cells
this in turn triggered *production* of dentine , to help heal the tooth
breakthrough could mean many patients will no longer need painful and costly treatment and may also spell the end of dentures
