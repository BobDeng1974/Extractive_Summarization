by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 16:45 est , 7 may 2013 in a major boost for the global economy , the @entity1 closed above 15000 points for the first time on tuesday			1
ending the day 87 points up on monday , the @entity1 closed up 0.6 percent to 15,056.20 - the latest landmark in a near four - year rally which has seen the stock market rise 130 percent			2
the historic gains will fuel growing confidence in the @entity13 economy , but the @entity14 is not expected to relax its policy of keeping interest rates at almost zero - seen by many as a key supporting factor in the rise of the @entity1			1
record : the @entity1 today reached its highest ever level at 15,013 analysts have attributed the steady rise of the @entity25 to investors fear of missing out on the rally replacing their concerns about the risk of a sell off			1
earlier today , the stockmarket hit new highs as the @entity1 passed a record - breaking 15,000			1
the index , which tracks the value of 30 of the biggest @entity13 companies , smashed through 15,000 , before falling back slightly			2
the @entity36 500 also reached its highest level ever as the prolonged stock rally showed no sign of slowing down despite the struggling global economy			2
the @entity36 has risen for three straight days , increasing more than 13 per cent so far this year - more than in the whole of 2012			0
yesterday it closed at a record high of 1,617 , and today reached an intraday high of 1,620			0
the strong performance of equities in recent days has been attributed to last week 's strong employment figures from the @entity13 , as well as the @entity14 's stimulus programme			0
healthy profits at major @entity13 corporations are also driving the market higher			1
more than 80 per cent of companies in the @entity36 have reported their first quarter - earnings , and profits are at a record level			1
however , revenues have been less promising as gross sales have falled short of expectations so far this year			0
the @entity1 , which is up more than 14 per cent this year , first passed 15,000 on friday , but has still never closed above that level in any given day			0
both of the main indices have been setting a series of records after regaining all of the losses they suffered in the 2008 financial crisis			1
recent gains have been especially strong in technology and banking , which tend to rise or fall sharply in sync with the overall health of the global economy			0
another good sign for the global economy is that the price of ultra-safe assets such as @entity13 government bonds has been falling , showing investors are ready to take more risks with their money			0
however , renewed turmoil in the eurozone and the risk of @entity13 government shutdown could yet shake world market in the months to come .			0

@entity1 reaches closes at 15 , 056 as @entity36 also hits record
major @entity13 indices have now made up all their losses from financial crisis
