a drug cartel lieutenant has been arrested over a series of firebomb attacks on @entity4 potato - chip company @entity3 , a subsidiary of @entity6 food giant @entity5			1
the gang - related bombings are believed to be the first time a multinational company has been targeted in @entity4 's 5Â½ - year - long drug war			1
experts suggested that the attack may be linked to the company 's apparent refusal to hand over protection money to the gangs which have terrorised local residents and businesses			0
attack : @entity3 , owned by @entity20 , was targeted in a series of firebombs on friday and saturday five @entity3 warehouses and vehicle lots were attacked on friday and saturday in the @entity4 states of @entity26 and @entity27			1
witnesses in one case described armed , masked men who tossed firebombs and torched dozens of the company 's distribution trucks and some warehouses			0
@entity35 , president of @entity4 's @entity36 , said on monday that it was ' an isolated case ' of the kind of extortion that gangs have previously practiced with small and medium - sized businesses			1
he called on authorities to act immediately to prevent the practice from spreading			0
' what we can not allow is for this kind of isolated case to become generalized , ' mr @entity35 said			0
' the authorities have to take forceful action			0
' in a speech to an anti-crime conference on monday , president @entity50 said drug cartels threaten growth and development and called them ' an obstacle to prosperity because they attack companies large and small			2
' up in flames : the attacks are believed to be linked to the firm 's refusal to pay protection money to cartels bombed : five different sites in two @entity4 states belonging to the company were affected the state attorney general 's office in @entity27 confirmed on monday that several suspects had been detained in the attacks there , and that one was identified as a lieutenant of the @entity76 drug cartel			1
@entity77 , a security analyst and former official in @entity4 's @entity80 intelligence agency , said it was the first attack he could recall against a transnational company in @entity4			0
even in @entity4 's most violent city , @entity85 , the warring drug gangs have largely left alone the many foreign - operated assembly plants known as maquiladoras			1
' in @entity85 , they practically never tried to blackmail the maquiladoras , ' mr @entity77 said			0
' they focused more on small businesses ... they are easier targets , and with an industrial firm , one does n't know exactly who to blackmail			2
' in a statement issued on sunday , @entity5 said five distribution centres were damaged , but added that no one was injured in the attacks			0
tackling the blaze : firefighters battled to put out the fires , which have led to a number of arrests the company appeared to respond to emails that circulated in @entity26 , home of the @entity76 gang , suggesting the attacks were revenge for the unproven allegation that prosecutors used @entity3 ' extensive fleet of delivery trucks to gather intelligence			1
' we repeat that in accordance with our code of conduct , all of our operations are carried out in the current regulatory framework and our vehicles and facilities are used exclusively to carry our products to our customer and clients , ' the company said			0
mr @entity77 said such a spying scenario sounded unlikely , if not impossible			0
@entity3 employs more than 70,000 people and has a nationwide delivery fleet of about 14,500 trucks that are a common sight even in the most dangerous and remote parts of @entity4			2
he added that the attacks may not represent a new stage in drug gang extortions , but rather stem from the peculiar characteristics of the @entity76 , a pseudo-religious cartel that split from @entity26 's @entity138 cartel in 2011			1
the @entity76 organisation is a relatively local , minor player in drug smuggling , trafficking mainly in methamphetamines and marijuana			1
with little access to the more lucrative cocaine and heroin business , cartel members have sought to raise money from other criminal activities			2
' the @entity76 have been more aggressive in their use of extortion and alternative sources [ of income ] than practically any other cartel , except the @entity156 , ' mr @entity77 said			1
the hyperviolent @entity156 cartel was formed along @entity4 's @entity158 by deserters from an elite military unit and has been linked to the extortion and kidnapping of civilians .			2
