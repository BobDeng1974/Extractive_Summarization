beaming broadly as a spiky haired @entity1 clown named @entity2 approached , @entity3 of @entity4 was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed an evening at the circus with sister princess @entity7			1
the @entity8 is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974			0
but while @entity3 and @entity7 appeared to be enjoying the show , the newest additions to @entity4 's royal family were nowhere to be seen			2
all smiles : @entity3 and princess @entity7 enjoy the antics of @entity1 clown @entity16 what a gentleman ! @entity19 plants a kiss on @entity7 's outstretched hand new mother @entity22 was also absent , having chosen to remain at home with month - old twins , @entity25 and @entity26			1
their absence did n't prevent @entity3 from enjoying himself , however , although the event briefly took a sombre turn at the beginning of the night			2
part way through the opening ceremony , a minute 's silence was held in memory of stunt rider @entity36 , a.k.a @entity37 , 24 , who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on wednesday			1
despite his death , the show continued after the minute 's silence with elephants , acrobats and clowns all on the billing			0
at one point , princess @entity7 , who is no stranger to circuses , was left smiling when ringmaster @entity19 approached and planted a kiss on her hand - much to @entity3 's amusement			2
royal approval : the clown , real name @entity56 , raised smiles all round round of applause : @entity3 , who was taking a night off from daddy duties , claps at the end of the performance welcome : new father @entity3 also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively looking good : despite having two tiny babies to care for , @entity3 looked surprisingly fresh royal wave : @entity3 waves to the @entity72 crowd from the comfort of the royal box tribute : ahead of the performance , there was a minute 's silence for a performer who died earlier this week the prince himself certainly appeared to enjoy the show , gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared , throwing himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse			1
@entity7 , who is patron of the @entity8 , was making her second visit to the @entity89 in a week , having already met clowns and elephant trainers on tuesday			0
during that visit , the 49 - year - old , who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000 , was seen patting one of the circus ' pachyderms , looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk			0
the royal , who also helps to oversee the @entity101 and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography , first attended the event when she was just nine			0
her father @entity106 was the brains behind the first festival , which now as then , specialises in traditional circus acts from clowns to acrobats			0
left at home : princess @entity22 chose to remain at the @entity113 along with the baby twins glamorous : the chic 36 - year - old was last seen on the 7th january when the babies were presented daredevil : a member of @entity120 group @entity119 performs in front of the royal box ouch ! an @entity124 elephant trained by @entity125 shows off his dexterity during the performance amazing : equilibrist acrobats from @entity130 's @entity129 show off their impressive skills @entity132 inspiring : an @entity124 elephant completes its turn as do @entity120 @entity135 and @entity136 magnificent : @entity120 equine troupe @entity138 wave a @entity4 national flag during the finale of their act			1
