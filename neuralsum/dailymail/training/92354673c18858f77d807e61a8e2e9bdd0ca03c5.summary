by @entity0 for young singer @entity2 it takes more than just an extra strong mint or a stick of chewing gum to freshen her breath			1
the 22 - year - old has been forced to change her diet after being diagnosed with a rare but debilitating condition - fish odour syndrome			1
the smell can be so strong it can engulf a room and the condition has left the singer eliminating certain foods in a bid to stem the stench			1
ms @entity2 suffers from @entity17 , a rare metabolic disorder where the body can not break down trimethylamine , which is found in certain foods			1
@entity2 , 22 , ( pictured ) suffers from @entity17 , or fish odour syndrome , which is a rare metabolic disorder where the body ca n't break down trimethylamine which is found in certain foods			1
the result is that she can make a room smell of rotting fish the disorder causes the chemical to build up in her system before it is released in her sweat , urine and breath - giving off a strong fishy odour			1
ms @entity2 , from @entity32 , said : ‘ you know when you go to the food market and there ’s rotting fish ? that ’s what i smell like			1
‘ the whiff comes out from my skin and hair			0
i sweat it out and it does n’t matter how many showers i take , i just ca n’t get rid of it			1
‘ there were times when i smelt so badly of fish that my mum would n’t let me go to school because she did n’t want me to be bullied by the other kids			2
‘ and it ’s hardly ideal to have to go on stage and give a performance when you stink of fish ! ’ she is unable to smell her own odour and has to rely on friends and family to tell her			2
‘ the fact that i ca n’t sniff it out myself is the most frustrating thing about the disorder			2
it makes you paranoid , ’ she said			0
ms @entity2 's unpleasant smell was first noticeable when she was three years old , her sister first picking up on it			1
‘ i used to share my bedroom with my sister and she started complaining about how much i stank of fish , ’ ms @entity66 said			2
‘ my mum presumed she was just being the standard grumpy older sibling and ignored her			0
however gradually , the smell became so strong that no - one could deny it			2
’ she saw several doctors but none could explain the reason for her fishy odour			2
it was only after ms @entity2 ’ mother listened to a radio show about someone with fish odour syndrome , that she was finally diagnosed with the condition			1
ms @entity2 ( pictured now , left and as a child , right ) said it is not ideal to have to go on stage and give a performance when you stink of fish			1
she is unable to smell her own odour			0
ms @entity66 ' condition became noticeable when she was three and her mother worried she might be bullied at school because of it ' i used to share my bedroom with my sister and she started complaining about how much i stank of fish , ' ms @entity66 said			2
' my mum presumed she was just being the standard grumpy older sibling and ignored her			0
however gradually , the smell became so strong that no - one could deny it ' @entity17 is an uncommon genetic disorder that causes a strong body odour usually described as like rotting fish , faeces or rubbish			1
the smell is created when the body is not able to break down trimethylamine - a smelly chemical that is produced in the gut - particularly when protein and choline - rich foods are digested , such as meat and eggs			1
the chemical trimethylamine builds up the body and sufferers of the condition give off a strong odour in their sweat , urine and breath			1
usually the smell first becomes apparent in childhood when children first eat food responsible for the odour			0
sometimes the disorder is temporary			0
typically people with the disorder typically avoid eggs , dark green vegetables such as broccoli and peas , beans , seafood and oily fish			2
low doses of antibiotics can suppress the production of trimethylamine in the short term and supplements can help , but lifestyle changes are mostly used to treat trimethylaminuria			0
ms @entity2 began to identify the foods that were directly causing her smell and as a result she has cut out fish , meat and dark green leafy vegetables out of her diet			1
‘ eliminating those foods was devastating			0
as a child , fish fingers were my favourite food , ' said ms @entity2			1
‘ over the years , i ’ve tried to re-introduce small amounts of fish into my diet again to see if i had grown out of it			0
but each time , i wake up the next morning and my whole bedroom reeks of fish			0
’ the singer - songwriter says that living with @entity17 is a daily struggle			2
‘ even now , it ’s hard explaining to others that i have fish odour syndrome , ' she added			1
it ’s so rare that people do n’t believe you when you say you have it			0
‘ at gigs , i feel like a right diva asking that they do n’t serve certain food			0
' reputation is everything in the music business and i do n’t want people regarding me as ungrateful			0
i know i ’m not @entity178 ! ’ one person who is supportive of ms @entity2 ’s disorder is her boyfriend , @entity179 , a 21 - year - old student			1
‘ i ’m so fortunate that @entity179 is cool about the smell and does n’t find me gross , ’ she said			0
the condition causes the chemical to build up in ms @entity2 ' system before it is released in her sweat , urine and breath - giving off a strong fishy odour			1
she is pictured here with a plate of the food she enjoys eating , but has to steer clear of ‘ he helps me with my restricted diet			2
we also have a pact that if i stink of fish in the morning , he ’ll tell me immediately and try not to laugh			0
‘ i ’m lucky i ’ve found a boy who has a sense of humour about it			0
@entity179 ’s family have accepted me with it too - in fact , his dad often make jokes about me smelling ! ’ however , ms @entity2 admits that her condition has led to some embarrassing moments during their relationship			1
‘ for @entity209 , @entity179 treated me to a lovely meal at a posh restaurant			0
i was swept away by the whole occasion and stupidly , i thought i ’d treat myself and try some seafood , ' she said			0
' there were times when i smelt so badly of fish that my mum would n’t let me go to school because she did n’t want me to be bullied by the other kids ' - @entity2 ‘ later during that evening , i absolutely stank of fish - not romantic at all			2
’ ms @entity2 , who is currently working on her first solo album ‘ unpunished ’ , wants to educate more people about the disorder			1
‘ i ’ve got to a point where i do n’t want to hide it anymore			0
it ’s a tricky thing to admit that “ yeah , i stink ” but at the end of the day , there are worse things in life than smelling of fish , ’ she said			0
‘ fellow sufferers need to be more open and talk about their experiences			0
’ dr @entity233 , a consultant in @entity234 at @entity235 in @entity32 , said : ‘ @entity17 is still very much under - recognised and a lot of doctors are n’t aware of the condition			2
‘ as a result , it takes a long time for patients to be referred to a specialist and diagnosed			0
‘ treatment is a diet low in trimethylamine , which is found in fish and choline , which is found in foods like red meat and eggs			1
