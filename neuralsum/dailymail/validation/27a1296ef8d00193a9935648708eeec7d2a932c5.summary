anti-police : lawyer @entity1 with a woman believed to be his wife great orator , reads a glowing reference from one of lawyer @entity1 ’s appreciative former clients			1
the testimonial is included on mr @entity1 ’s cv on a professional networking site ; the person who wrote it is named , so it ’s not made up			1
but the identity of the individual in question is something we shall come back to because it tells us rather a lot about this silver - tongued solicitor			0
in any event , mr @entity1 ’s skills as an ‘ orator ’ , for want of a better word , have been much in evidence on the national stage recently			1
you might have heard mr @entity1 in full flow on the radio or caught a glimpse of him on the evening news earlier this month in his ( very lawyerly ) charcoal - grey , three - piece suit and swish purple silk tie			1
what he had to say was certainly splashed across the papers			0
mr @entity1 , 37 , was giving evidence to mps on the @entity41 with his latest clients : the families of the three girls from @entity44 , @entity45 , who fled the @entity46 to join @entity47			1
mr @entity1 denounced the authorities for allowing @entity49 , 16 , and 15 ‑ year - olds @entity50 and @entity51 to leave @entity46 and reach @entity52 after going missing in december			1
he castigated the police for failing to inform their parents that a school friend had vanished in similar circumstances a few weeks earlier			0
and he demanded — and got — a grovelling apology from the country ’s top police officer for the ‘ mistake ’ that , in the eyes of most neutral observers , probably had little or no bearing on what happened to the youngsters			0
‘ relations can be built after they have broken down only after an apology , ’ mr @entity1 insisted loftily			1
the audacity takes your breath away			0
for we now know that the father of @entity51 , one of the missing schoolgirl ‘ jihadi brides ’ , is himself a supporter of militant @entity76			1
images posted online show @entity78 taking part in a notorious @entity82 rally back in september 2012 in @entity45 , when flags of @entity84 and the @entity85 were burned			1
also in attendance that day was hate preacher @entity87 , as well as @entity88 , one of the two @entity90 converts who went on to murder soldier @entity92			1
@entity78 could not have found a more suitable lawyer to front the families ’ anti-police campaign			0
@entity78 ( circled right ) , whose daughter fled the @entity46 last month to join @entity97 , was pictured at an @entity76 protest alongside @entity92 killer @entity88 ( circled left ) vicious : in 2012 , @entity78 ( left ) marched at the head of a violent rally held by @entity90 extremists in @entity45 , taking part in the burning of an @entity85 flag @entity1 has gone on record in the past to declare that no @entity90 should co-operate with the @entity46 police force because the government ’s prevent counter-terror policy is ‘ straightforward , paid - for spying on the community ’			1
he once asked in an internet rant : ‘ does she [ home secretary @entity113 ] have @entity115 blood in her veins ? ’ imagine the furore if someone had insulted a @entity90 leader in the same vein			1
the wider public might not have heard of mr @entity1 until now but behind his self - righteous performance in the @entity123 , behind his fancy legal credentials , behind his respectable upbringing ( his father and two younger brothers are all doctors ) , is an individual with links to what some might describe as the ‘ who ’s who ’ of @entity76 extremists in @entity46			1
consider , to begin with , a cartoon posted on his @entity137 page on january 12 , less than a week after the @entity139 atrocity in @entity140			1
it depicted murdered editor @entity142 blowing himself up by detonating a suicide vest comprising of rolled - up copies of the magazine which resembled sticks of dynamite , the clear implication being that the journalist was to blame for his own death and those of nine colleagues for frequently publishing satires about the prophet @entity154			0
that message reinforced a previous @entity137 entry on the day of the @entity140 attack itself			1
‘ please do n’t repeatedly poke a sleeping bear , ’ wrote mr @entity1 , ‘ then cry when it bites “ your head off , ” parce @entity160 [ @entity163 for ‘ because that is really very stupid ]			2
’ could there be a more inappropriate way of behaving , given his profession ? mr @entity1 ( right ) , 37 , gave evidence to mps on the @entity41 alongside mr @entity78 and his family mr @entity1 ’s father arrived in this country from @entity173 in the @entity174			1
he runs a @entity176 surgery with his two other sons in @entity178 , @entity179			0
mr @entity1 ’s nauseating performance before mps closely echoed preposterous claims made by ‘ human rights group ’ @entity183 last week that @entity185 was responsible for radicalising @entity186 , the is butcher known to the world as @entity188			2
just a coincidence ? unlikely			0
in only january , mr @entity1 — surprise , surprise — shared a platform with @entity183 when he argued that the @entity46 had a ‘ @entity194 , two - tier legal system ’ which was ‘ a breeding ground for fascism ’			2
mr @entity1 said @entity92 killer @entity196 was ' created ' by the security services in an article carried on the @entity183 website , he also claimed that the security services ‘ created ’ @entity196 — who with @entity88 killed @entity201 fusilier @entity92 — by ‘ making his life so difficult ’			1
mr @entity1 represented a close friend of @entity196 , who was sentenced to three years for terrorist offences in 2013			1
and who do you think the glowing testimonial mentioned in the opening paragraph of this article was from ? it was penned by someone called @entity212 , a former member of the so - called ‘ @entity213 ’			0
he served two years back in 2010 following the discovery in his home of gruesome beheading videos and an arsenal of weapons , including knives , machetes , a sword and ammunition			0
‘ i recommend mr @entity224 for all @entity90 brothers and sisters arrested under the @entity227 , ’ he wrote			2
‘ he is a true and genuine friend and brother to all who meet him			0
’ the reference is included on mr @entity1 ’s biography on professional networking site @entity232			2
they say you can judge a person by the company he keeps			0
might the same yardstick be extended to the company a person keeps online ? among his other @entity137 friends are a notorious hate preacher , a former member of banned terror group @entity243 , a one - time @entity245 detainee , and , almost inevitably , @entity246 , the leading figure in @entity183 , the man who for years was in regular contact with @entity188 , to name but a few of mr @entity1 ’s unsavoury contacts			1
this was the man , remember , who was given a public platform in the @entity123			0
mr @entity1 — as the @entity253 has revealed in previous articles — is part of a network of extremists spreading poisonous propaganda that is turning the heads of so many young @entity90			1
but mr @entity1 , like @entity246 , has much for which to thank the country he despises			2
the solicitor is also friends on @entity137 with @entity246 - the leading figure in @entity183 who was in regular contact with @entity188 we now know that the father of @entity51 , one of the missing schoolgirl ‘ jihadi brides ’ ( pictured ) , is himself a supporter of militant @entity76 he studied law at two of its universities : he was an undergraduate at @entity274 and a postgraduate at @entity276			1
he was at @entity276 , a college with an appalling reputation for campus radicalism , in 2007/08			0
@entity186 / @entity188 was enrolled at @entity276 at that time on a computer programming course , but there is nothing to suggest they knew each other			0
mr @entity1 , also known as @entity284 , now works for @entity285 in @entity286 , @entity287			2
radical : @entity51 , 15 , daughter of @entity78 , travelled to @entity52 with two other girls home is a @entity292 terrace in @entity179 , where the curtains and blinds were drawn yesterday			0
but he was also recently living in a flat in a block near @entity298 , where flats typically sell for more than £ 1 million			0
mr @entity1 is pictured in the vicinity on @entity137 in the company of an attractive blonde			1
asked by one friend : ‘ who is she brother ? ’ , he replies : ‘ new wife			0
’ when another friend commented that she was ‘ without hijab ’ — a veil that covers the head and chest — mr @entity1 informs him : ‘ working on it			2
’ mr @entity1 ’s first marriage to a law student he met at @entity274 lasted less than a year			2
‘ in @entity173 culture , ’ said someone who knows the family , ‘ it is usually the groom ’s mother who finds the wife			0
she [ @entity1 ’s mother ] was not happy that he married so quickly and divorced so quickly			2
’ but his career has gone from strength to strength			0
his latest case was given star billing at his law practice			0
the firm ’s rolling @entity330 feed repeated three tweets ; all refer to the missing schoolgirls from @entity44 in @entity52 and mentioning mr @entity1 as having ‘ conduct of the case of the three girls ’			2
how mr @entity1 , who is based on the other side of @entity45 , came to be representing the families or why they should need a lawyer in the first place is not clear			1
however , the families ’ decision to effectively absolve themselves of any responsibility for the disappearance of their daughters , and scapegoat the police instead , has left them facing a backlash of criticism			0
senior figures , led by @entity350 , insisted parents must take responsibility to help stop the spreading of militant beliefs			0
not in the eyes of @entity1 , who once claimed that even a shop assistant who ‘ sold a terrorist a toothbrush in boots ’ would be guilty of aiding and abetting terrorism under terror laws			2
in a recent video on an extremist @entity363 channel , he also denied that those who call for the death of @entity46 soldiers should be defined as extremist because ‘ i think it is actually a soldier ’s job to die ’			0
mr @entity1 ’s views are shared by others in his online community			2
are n’t they , and not the police , the ones who are really driving so many young @entity46 @entity90 into the hands of @entity375 ?			1

@entity1 blamed authorities for allowing jihadi schoolgirl to flee
father of ' jihadi bride ' attended rally with @entity92 killer , pictures show
@entity1 has previously said @entity90 should not co-operate with the police
he posted a sickening cartoon on @entity137 after the @entity139 attack
lawyer also said security services ' created ' @entity92 killer @entity196
