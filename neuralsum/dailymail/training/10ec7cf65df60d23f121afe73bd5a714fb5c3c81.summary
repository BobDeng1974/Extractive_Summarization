before the likes of @entity2 , @entity3 and other pioneers of the technological world , 20th century inventors came up with novel and wacky ways of developing existing products			0
among the most bizarre ideas that never managed to take off include reading glasses fitted with mirrors and radio - fitted hats from the 1930s ; an extendable caravan that made a stretch limousine look compact , and a car that could scoop pedestrians off the road to prevent them from being run over			1
other inventions include a vending machine that served hot sausages in @entity22 and a contraption that shut out all outside noise and was fitted with an oxygen mask to ensure the wearer did n't suffocate			1
these @entity28 glasses were invented in 1936 and were designed to make it easier for people to read in bed			1
the words from the page were beamed to the reader 's eyes using mirrors so the reader could lie on their back and now have to strain their neck forget the stretch limo , this invention from 1934 is a stretch caravan			1
it was designed by a @entity46 engineer and comprised of three sections that slotted together when the caravan was being towed			1
when the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite , the caravan could be extended to provide extra living space in 1924 , swimwear was fitted with wooden panels as safety devices			1
the wood was naturally buoyant and were designed to stop wearers from drowning yet despite these early inventors ' forward - thinking , many of these creations never made it into the mainstream			1
the pioneering radio hat designed in the @entity66 in 1931 comprised of a boater hat fitted with a transmitter and speaker , allowing the wearer to take the news with them wherever they go			2
a more ambitious way of using the relatively new wireless radio technology was in the 1921 radio pram			0
it was fitted with a transmitter and meant parents could keep up with news and current affairs while walking their child			2
the radio could also be used to soothe the baby 's crying for people who preferred reading rather than listening to the radio , a pair of @entity28 glasses were invented in 1936 designed to make it easier for people to read in bed			1
the words from the page were beamed to the reader 's eyes using mirrors so the reader could lie on their back and not have to strain their neck			1
many of the other historical brainwaves of the early 20th century involved inventors ' taking transportation at the time and making it more efficient or useful			0
a @entity46 inventor created an amphibious bicycle that let the user navigate land and sea using bulbous floats combined with wheels			1
the 1924 @entity116 allowed wearers to swim safely because the wooden panels were naturally buoyant and would keep them afloat			0
following the invention of the wireless , inventors in the @entity66 took the technology a step further			2
the radio headwear , left , was invented in 1931 and comprised of a boater hat fitted with a radio transmitter and a speaker			1
while the radio pram from 1921 , right , was equipped with a transmitter that could be used to soothe the baby as it slept before radar equipment became more mainstream , an inventor in the 1940s came up with this novel way of trying to listen for enemies			2
the dishes were used to pick up and amplify sounds , which became louder as they moved through the tunnels			0
the user could then listen into by standing in the centre and putting each ear on the tunnel exits @entity146 @entity145 ’s harebrained idea for a one - wheeled motorcycle was conceived in 1931 and enabled the rider to hit speeds of 150 kilometers per hour			0
forget the stretch limo , in 1934 one @entity46 engineer invented the stretch caravan			1
it comprised of three sections that slotted together when the caravan was being towed			2
when the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite , the caravan could be extended to provide extra living space			2
another wacky design to come from the same decade may have been one of the first off - road vehicles			0
invented in 1936 , the truck was fitted with ten wheels and each tyre sat at slightly different angles			1
this meant it could drive across all terrains and climb up and down slopes with a 65 per cent gradient			0
this wacky design may have been one of the first off - road vehicles			0
it was invented in 1936 and had ten wheels with tyres sitting at different angles			1
this meant it could drive across all terrains and climb up and down slopes with a 65 per cent gradient another take on the design of cars at the start of the @entity186 , this vehicle was fitted with a safety scoop to prevent pedestrians from being run over			2
it was designed in @entity46 and this picture dates back to 1924 transport safety was also a key concern and in 1920s @entity194 , inventors came up with a scoop to attach to the front of cars which meant that if a pedestrian were hit they would be safely scooped up into the net			1
all the noise of the city too much for you ? how about slipping into @entity204 ’s 1925 invention , the isolator			2
this contraption was designed to eliminate all outside noise and isolate the user in a peaceful working environment			0
it came complete with an oxygen mask so the wearer would n’t suffocate			0
later in the century , before radar equipment became mainstream , an inventor in the 1940s came up with a novel way of trying to listen for enemies			0
large dishes were used to pick up and amplify sounds , which became louder as they moved through attached tunnels			0
the user could then listen in by standing in the centre and putting each ear on the tunnel exits			0
@entity227 's 1925 invention , the isolator , pictured left , was a contraption designed to eliminate all outside noise and isolate the user in a peaceful working environment			0
it came complete with an oxygen mask so the wearer would n't suffocate			0
the invention on the right is an early , @entity22 take on the vending machine from 1931 that served hot sausages rather than fizzy drinks			1

others include reading glasses fitted with mirrors so readers did n't have to strain their neck , invented in 1936
in @entity194 during the 1920s , one inventor created an extendable caravan that made stretch limousines look compact
a @entity22 invention included a vending machine which dispensed hot sausages instead of fizzy drinks
