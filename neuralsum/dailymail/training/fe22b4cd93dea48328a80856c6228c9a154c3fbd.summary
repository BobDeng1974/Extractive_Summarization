by @entity0 for @entity1 it was once a 5 - star resort swarming with happy guests but now the former @entity4 has been transformed into a @entity6 shrine , with pictures of himself covering the walls , several in - house @entity11 channels and more dinosaurs then guests			1
when purchasing the hotel in 2011 for an estimated $ 6.5 million , billionaire @entity6 promised his newly renovated seaside resort would lure cashed - up @entity19 visitors and make for a better economy , @entity15 reported			2
now , nearly three years on @entity21 would be seeing minimum return on his self - claimed $ 2 billion injection into the property , producing nothing but a ghost town , according to @entity28 's program , a @entity29			1
in february this year , the @entity51 reported the @entity39 's resort was at a loss of $ 500,000 a month , resulting in 90 job cuts and forcing remaining staff at @entity21 to work long hours and inter-changing jobs			1
@entity1 attempted to contact the @entity56 leader and @entity21 resort , who responded with ' no comment '			1
facilities in the @entity39 resort have been closed for ' maintenance ' in @entity29 's hidden - investigation , workers at the resort admit it is ' short of staff ' , ' a bit pricey ' and ' a quiet time '			1
and although demand is low at @entity21 , the price stands quite high , with rates for a standard room between $ 230 to $ 350 , a tub of @entity74 's ice cream $ 25 and a pad thai priced at $ 30			1
guests on @entity79 describe the resort ' at best , a three star job ' , meals ' over priced and pool ' , ' staff were fine but like skittish deer and rarely seen ' and ' guests were pretty thin on the ground too			2

” we felt like we had stepped into a weird movie			0
it was eerily quiet and seemed abandoned			0
gardens were a mess and infrastructure old and @entity104 ever present @entity6 propaganda was subconsciously @entity105 were outrageous and definately did not reflect the hotel experience we thought we were going to get			0
skeleton staff were @entity109 loved the dinosaur @entity111 expected an @entity51 experience in @entity114 restaurant but there was nothing except a portrait of @entity114 on the menu in the whole restaurant that themed the room			0
but there was a picture of the titanic ... and photos of @entity6 of course ! - kristalgee , from @entity126 @entity90 “ @entity127 and tired ” visited the resort for a conference			2
as one drives in it is very obvious that thus place needs a good spruce up to its former glory			0
staff were friendly and our food tasted were catered for			0
even us @entity139 ! i just kept noticing things that needed doing around the place , the paint that needed refreshing , paving askew , buildings looking tired			0
- @entity145 from @entity146 , @entity90 “ if you want 5 stars this is n't the place - does n't live up to its own website ” we went for 1 night and noted the following ; can not stay a full 24 hours checkin at 2pm , checkout at 10am ; free internet does not exist , costs at least $ 12.95 ; the meals were incredibly overpriced with a 15 % surcharge on @entity158 ; $ 10 surcharge for room service ; the rooms were tired and the air con did n't reach the rooms ; the advertised spa was closed and the water spas empty ; even the hair dryer did n't work.overall this place was over priced and disappointing , not delivering what it advertises			0
we will not be returning			0
- @entity170 from @entity171 , @entity51 “ has not been maintained ” having visited this resort many times under the @entity4 banner , i thought i would give it another try			1
really disappointing to see a lovely @entity21 so run down			2
the rooms have not been kept up , the property looked scruffy - all the little boutique shops have closed down			0
