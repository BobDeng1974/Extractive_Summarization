a @entity5 - winning @entity4 player 's heartfelt @entity2 post written in reaction to the events in @entity8 , @entity0 has been shared over 200,000 times in less than one day			1
@entity11 tight end @entity10 detailed his anger , fear , frustration and a dozen other emotions in a post written tuesday after the black @entity18 native had some time to digest what was going on in the wake of monday 's grand jury decision to not convict @entity22			1
' after trying to figure out how i felt , i decided to write it down			1
here are my thoughts , ' wrote the 33 - year - old			1
' i 'm angry because the stories of injustice that have been passed down for generations seem to be continuing before our very eyes , ' he says			1
@entity10 also moves between feeling anger for the treatment of black @entity46 and frustration with the violent reactions to the decision			1
' in the back of my mind i know ... i could still be looked upon as a " threat " to those who do n't know me			1
so i will continue to have to go the extra mile to earn the benefit of the doubt , ' he writes			1
@entity10 's negative feelings ultimately give way to positive ones as he writes about his @entity62 faith			1
' i 'm encouraged , because ultimately the problem is not a skin problem , it is a @entity65 problem			1
@entity65 is the reason we rebel against authority , ' he said			1
the tight end 's 650 - word outpouring of emotion had been shared on @entity2 over 200,000 after fewer than 24 hours and received nearly 400,000 likes at some point while i was playing or preparing to play @entity75 , the news broke about the @entity77			1
after trying to figure out how i felt , i decided to write it down			1
here are my thoughts : i 'm angry because the stories of injustice that have been passed down for generations seem to be continuing before our very eyes			1
i 'm frustrated , because pop culture , music and movies glorify these types of police citizen altercations and promote an invincible attitude that continues to get young men killed in real life , away from safety movie sets and music studios			1
i 'm fearful because in the back of my mind i know that although i 'm a law abiding citizen i could still be looked upon as a " threat " to those who do n't know me			1
so i will continue to have to go the extra mile to earn the benefit of the doubt			1
i 'm embarrassed because the looting , violent protests , and law breaking only confirm , and in the minds of many , validate , the stereotypes and thus the inferior treatment			2
i 'm sad , because another young life was lost from his family , the racial divide has widened , a community is in shambles , accusations , insensitivity hurt and hatred are boiling over , and we may never know the truth about what happened that day			2
i 'm @entity124 , because i was n't there so i do n't know exactly what happened			2
maybe @entity22 acted within his rights and duty as an officer of the law and killed @entity131 in self defense like any of us would in the circumstance			1
now he has to fear the backlash against himself and his loved ones when he was only doing his job			2
what a horrible thing to endure			2
or maybe he provoked @entity131 and ignited the series of events that led to him eventually murdering the young man to prove a point			2
i 'm offended , because of the insulting comments i 've seen that are not only insensitive but dismissive to the painful experiences of others			2
i 'm confused , because i do n't know why it 's so hard to obey a policeman			2
you will not win ! ! ! and i do n't know why some policeman abuse their power			2
power is a responsibility , not a weapon to brandish and lord over the populace			2
i 'm @entity158 , because sometimes i want to take " our " side without looking at the facts in situations like these			0
sometimes i feel like it 's us against them			0
sometimes i 'm just as prejudiced as people i point fingers at			0
and that 's not right			0
how can i look at white skin and make assumptions but not want assumptions made about me ? that 's not right			0
i 'm hopeless , because i 've lived long enough to expect things like this to continue to happen			0
i 'm not surprised and at some point my little children are going to inherit the weight of being a minority and all that it entails			0
i 'm hopeful , because i know that while we still have race issues in @entity46 , we enjoy a much different normal than those of our parents and grandparents			0
i see it in my personal relationships with teammates , friends and mentors			0
and it 's a beautiful thing			0
i 'm encouraged , because ultimately the problem is not a skin problem , it is a @entity65 problem			0
@entity65 is the reason we rebel against authority			0
@entity65 is the reason we abuse our authority			0
@entity65 is the reason we are racist , prejudiced and lie to cover for our own			0
@entity65 is the reason we riot , loot and burn			0
but i 'm encouraged because @entity201 has provided a solution for sin through the his son @entity204 and with it , a transformed heart and mind			0
one that 's capable of looking past the outward and seeing what 's truly important in every human being			0
the cure for the @entity131 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity216 tragedies is not education or exposure			0
so , finally , i 'm encouraged because the @entity220 gives mankind hope .			0
