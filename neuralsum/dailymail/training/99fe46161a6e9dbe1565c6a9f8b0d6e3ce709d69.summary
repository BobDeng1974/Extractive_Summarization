on trial : @entity1 , 14 , could face the death penalty for the alleged murder of her husband , 35 a @entity7 child bride has ' admitted ' murdering her 35 - year - old husband with rat poison by signing a confession she could not read - with her thumbprint			1
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 14 - year - old @entity14 , whose farmer husband @entity15 was found dead just days after marrying her in april			1
if she is found guilty , the teenager - who is from a poor and deeply conservative @entity19 family and can not write - could become the first child in @entity7 to be executed in 18 years			1
human rights campaigners have expressed outrage over her treatment , saying she should be seen as a victim of abuse			1
but the case has prompted mixed reactions in her impoverished home state of @entity30 , where @entity33 ( @entity32 ) law is in place alongside the laws of the government			2
that , claim some followers , allows child marriage - and 14 is a normal age for a bride			2
@entity42 overflowed yesterday as prosecutors closed their case in the murder trial , with people peering in through the open windows and a crowd so large it spilled out of the gallery door			0
homicide investigator @entity51 revealed he translated @entity14 's statement from her native language , @entity54 , into @entity55 , which she did not speak			2
despite being unable to read the document she then signed it , he told the court			0
she could not write her name so ' she had to use a thumbprint , ' he added			0
one of the prosecution witnesses was the farmer 's second wife @entity63 , who told how her ' co-wife ' prepared him dinner before being due to go to bed with him			0
the court heard the murder victim had married @entity63 previously in the village of @entity73 , which sits in a region where polygamy is widespread			0
@entity63 said she got along well with the 14 - year - old and the two had prepared food together on april 5 , the day @entity15 died			1
if she is executed , it will be @entity7 's first reported execution of a child since 1997 because it was @entity14 's turn to share a bed with her new husband , she was also entitled to serve him his meal			1
' after putting the food in the dish i did n't see anybody put anything in it , ' @entity63 said - but later she saw her husband foaming at the mouth and unable to walk			0
previously a seven - year - old girl who @entity103 allegedly sent to buy rat poison was called to give evidence			1
identified only as @entity106 , the young girl - believed to be @entity63 's sister - was living in the same house as the 14 - year - old and her new husband at the time of his death			1
' she said rats were disturbing her in her room , ' @entity106 told the court			0
shopkeeper @entity116 confirmed selling poison to the girl , and neighbour @entity118 said : ' when [ @entity15 ] brought the food i noticed some sandy - like particles , black in colour '			2
@entity42 ( pictured ) overflowed yesterday as prosecutors closed their case in the murder trial , with people peering in through the open windows and a crowd so large it spilled out of the gallery door the neighbour ate four of the small balls made of bean paste but ' was not comfortable with the taste ' , he said , adding : ' it was only @entity15 ( @entity135 ) who continued eating			2
' previous court reports suggested three other people had died after allegedly eating the contaminated food , but all four deaths had been combined into one murder charge			0
the case has raised the spectre of child marriage in @entity7 , where campaigners say almost two fifths of children are married off before their 18th birthday			1
some 16 per cent are married before they turn 15 , according to the campaign group @entity149 - and the rates are the highest in the north , near where @entity14 lived			2
@entity153 from the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) , who is representing the teenager , told @entity157 : ' we are against the trial			0
the whole process violates her fundamental rights			0
' the @entity162 says she should be in education			0
she should be in school '			0
@entity166 , 55 , holds a picture of @entity14 , who is his daughter - in - law , at her abandoned matrimonial home in the village of @entity73			2
polygamy and child marriage are widespread in northern @entity7 but others including the 14 - year - old 's own relatives have rejected the notion she was forced into marriage			1
they have said that 14 is a common age to marry in the deeply impoverished region and that she chose @entity15 from among many suitors			0
a motion by defence lawyers to have the case moved to juvenile court was rejected , despite claims by human rights activists that she is too young to stand trial for murder in a high court			1
the use of @entity33 law has also made the case more complicated , because there are no guidelines saying where @entity32 law ends and state law begins			0
according to @entity199 , @entity7 is not known to have executed a juvenile offender since 1997 , when the country was ruled by military dictator @entity202			1
the trial , in which a not guilty plea was entered for the 14 - year - old , has been adjourned until february 16 .			1

prosecutors have sought death penalty for 14 - year - old @entity14
they translated alleged confession which she ' signed ' with her thumb
@entity15 , who had two wives , died days after marrying her in @entity30 state
human rights campaigners say she should be treated as victim of abuse
@entity7 is not known to have executed a child since military rule in 1997
