his daughter @entity36 , 52 , said her father was subjected to four days without food , water and medication			1

' he was asking us " am i going to die ? " , he knew what was happening to him and it was heartbreaking for us all			0

' he was begging for water - we had to wet a sponge and put it around his mouth			1
' if i did to my dog what they did to my father i would not be allowed to own a dog again			1
' no one should have to spend their final days like that			2

she said her mother was consulted about doctors ' decision to initiate the pathway , but adds that what it would entail was not explained properly			2
she told the @entity77 : ' if i knew then what i do now there is no way we would have let doctors him on the pathway			2

' the controversial @entity28 , which was designed in the late 1990s by the @entity125 's @entity124 , aims to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person 's life			1
a spokeswoman for @entity17 said an investigation into what happened to mr @entity2 is still ongoing the idea behind the @entity28 is to allow people with a terminal illness to die with dignity regardless of whether they are at home , in hospital or in a hospice			1
it was developed during the late 1990s at the @entity125 in conjunction with the @entity140			0
it gives doctors the opportunity to review whether further tests or medication are helpful , to consider how to keep the patient as comfortable as possible and to decide whether fluids and food should still be given			1
it was recommended by the @entity150 as a model of best practice and was adopted by most hospitals			0
it was introduced because during the 1990s there was increasing consensus that standards of end - of - life care were patchy and that some hospices were providing excellent care while others were not			1
particular concern was expressed about patients being subjected to invasive treatment that offered no chance of preventing death and of people being put through unnecessary suffering by needlessly prolonging life			1
it involves doctors withdrawing life - saving treatment , including fluids and drugs or putting patients on continuous sedation if they are deemed close to death			1
death typically takes place within 29 hours , studies have found			0
the idea was to allow terminal patients the opportunity to die with dignity whether they were at home , in hospital or being cared for at a hospice			0
but the plan has been criticised by some experts and presented as a cost - cutting way to bring about the premature deaths of elderly patients			1
in july ministers condemned the pathway as ' a national disgrace '			0
an inquiry – led by @entity197 @entity196 – unearthed ‘ distressing ’ evidence of ‘ desperate people ' , vindicating the @entity201 ’s persistent highlighting of relatives ’ concerns last year			1

they found they could no longer connect a food supply to feed the pensioner telling the family his organs were too badly damaged by his illness			0
he was put into an induced coma and died four days later on august 8			0
in september the @entity150 announced the hospital - which has been criticised by health inspectors for persistently high death rates - would be paired with the @entity233 's @entity232 in a bid to drive up care standards			1
the trust is in the process of investigating what happened to mr @entity2			1
a @entity240 and @entity239 said : ' the trust appreciates that the past few months have been extremely difficult for mr @entity2 's family , and has offered its apologies face - to - face in a meeting which took place on tuesday , october 8			1

' as discussed with the family , we will continue to have an open dialogue with them and will be providing them with a written response to their complaint once the investigations are completed			0
' baroness @entity257 led a recent inquiry into the @entity28 , recommending it be phased out in december 2012 it was revealed up to 60,000 patients die on the @entity28 each year without giving their consent , according to a joint study by the @entity140 in @entity28 and the @entity264			1
a third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones			0
records from 178 hospitals showed that thousands of people on the pathway are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them comfortable while drugs are administered			0
an estimated 130,000 patients are put on the pathway each year			0
concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway			0
it emerged health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £ 30million for putting more patients on the @entity28			2

mp @entity293 , the care services minister , launched a review in november 2012 , saying there had been too many cases of families not being consulted			0
in july , following an inquiry led by @entity300 @entity196 , ministers branded the @entity28 a ' national disgrace '			2
the study unearthed ' distressing ' evidence of ' desperate ' people and vindicated a campaign run by the @entity201 to highlight relatives ' concerns last year			2
it found families whose loved ones were put on the pathway suffered ‘ poor care , appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion ’			0
the inquiry heard ‘ heartbreaking accounts of people desperately sucking at sponges used to moisten their mouths ’			0
in all , the scathing report made 44 recommendations – including plans to phase out the @entity28 in favour of a reformed system based on individualised ‘ @entity327 ’			2
in future : relatives of people who died on the @entity28 have broadly welcomed the inquiry and the government ’s promise to put its recommendations into operation			2
but they questioned how the replacement care plans would work			0
@entity196 said ‘ the @entity28 was designed for the best reasons and absolutely the right principles lay behind it ’			2
however , she said it had become a ‘ tick - box exercise ’			0
insisting on a complete overhaul , she called for an end to the cash incentives – revealed by the @entity201 and paid to hospitals that hit targets for numbers of patients on the pathway			0
she said the cash raised the ‘ suspicion that people are being hastened towards death to help the financial situation of the trust ’			0
but while the report said the @entity28 should be phased out in six to 12 months , it left few details of the proposed replacement ‘ @entity327 ’			1
@entity196 said a new system of ‘ guides and alerts ’ should be individually tailored to patients , backed by medical professionals and patients , and inspected by the @entity363 .			0
