we are at the @entity2 semi-final stage and the heavyweights of international football are getting ready to square up with @entity5 and @entity6 , two of the biggest footballing powers on the planet , meeting on tuesday in @entity10			1
@entity5 : the hosts and winners of five @entity13 , the most in history			1
@entity6 : three - time victors who rarely fail to make the quarter - finals			1
here , @entity18 takes a look at the likely starting xis and how they match up against each other			0
scroll down to see the final score relaxed : @entity5 's @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) train ahead of tuesday 's crunch semi-final @entity26 ( @entity27 ) – age 34 , caps 85 @entity29 played a club game last season but boss @entity32 has kept faith and he was the penalty shootout hero in their last 16 win against @entity37			1
mixed : @entity26 starred in the last 16 shootout win over @entity37 but gave away a spot - kick against @entity40 @entity41 ( @entity42 ) – age 28 , caps 50 arguably the best goalkeeper in the world , and turning it on at this @entity2			1
made some outstanding saves to send them through in the quarter - final against @entity49			1
safe hands : @entity41 has been in excellent form , keeping three clean sheets in five games so far @entity54 : @entity41 highlights verdict : the @entity6 goalkeeper has been a colossus in the tournament , keeping three clean sheets and conceding just three goals in five games , setting him apart from his counterparts			1
right - back @entity23 ( @entity60 ) – age 31 , caps 79 , international goals 6 missed the last round , presumably to avoid suspension having been on one yellow card			1
one of the best full - backs in the game			0
back in action : @entity23 was rested against @entity40 but looks set to start against the @entity69 @entity70 ( @entity42 ) – age 30 , caps 111 , international goals 5 played as a defensive midfielder in the early rounds , but now back to his favoured right - back position and dominating that flank			1
versatile : @entity70 should keep his place at right - back after playing in midfield during the group stage @entity54 : @entity70 highlights verdict : @entity23 would win hands - down against most other right - backs , but not @entity70			1
he is the best out there in his position			0
@entity85 ( @entity86 ) – age 26 , caps 36 , international goals 4 occasionally erratic in defence , fearless going forward			0
@entity85 adds an extra element of flair to @entity5 's attack			1
on the attack : @entity86 defender @entity85 ( right ) will get forward for @entity5 against @entity95 's side @entity96 ( @entity97 ) – age 26 , caps 26 , international goals 2 usually a centre - back for @entity97 he has sacrificed his own comfort for the good of his country , but is yet to shine in the tournament			1
physical : @entity96 ( front ) holds off the challenge of @entity49 's @entity108 in the quarter - final verdict : given @entity96 is playing out of position , it has to go to @entity85 who can produce a moment of brilliance in a flash			1
centre - back @entity117 ( @entity42 ) – age 30 , caps 12 , international goals 2 expected to come in for the suspended @entity120 having been forced to watch the rest of the tournament from the bench			1
big opportunity : @entity42 's @entity117 looks set to replace the suspended @entity120 on tuesday @entity126 ( @entity42 ) – age 25 , caps 44 , international goals 2 a solid centre - half but has been too often bailed out by goalkeeper @entity41 throughout the tournament			1
nonetheless , started every game for @entity6			2
fortunate : @entity6 defender @entity126 ( right ) has been made to look better by his keeper @entity41 verdict : these two are polar opposites in this tournament – @entity126 has played virtually every minute while @entity117 is starting cold			2
based on that , the @entity69 wins it			0
@entity24 ( @entity137 ) – age 27 , caps 41 , international goals 2 nicknamed @entity140 for his wild hairstyle , @entity24 has been among the best entertainers at this summer 's feast of football			2
after sealing a £ 50million move from @entity137 to @entity146 , the 27 - year - old will now take on the captain 's armband in the absence of the suspended @entity120 as he bids to lead his country into the final			1
he has two goals in his last two games having not scored one for his country before the tournament			0
pure passion : @entity24 celebrates scoring a stunning free - kick against @entity40 in the last eight @entity159 ( @entity160 ) – age 25 , caps 34 , international goals 4 the defender is becoming one of the hottest properties on the market for his displays during this @entity2			0
scored the winner against @entity49 when he outmuscled @entity168 to head in a free - kick			1
key man : @entity159 seured @entity6 's place in the semi-finals with the winning goal against @entity49 in @entity174 verdict : if it was sheer passion and putting on a show , @entity24 would get the nod			1
but defending is about solidity and reliability , and @entity159 is streaks ahead in those departments			0
central midfield @entity182 ( @entity183 ) – age 26 , caps 23 , international goals 1 @entity5 's midfield enforcer has been kicking , thumping and bashing his way through this @entity2 , to devastating effect			2
back from a one - match suspension , he will be chomping at the bit			0
hard man : @entity182 ( right ) will attempt to break up @entity6 attacks in the centre of midfield @entity196 ( @entity86 ) – age 27 , caps 50 , international goals 4 @entity199 target @entity196 has done little wrong but also little to inspire so far , although , in fairness , he has not played much for @entity86 over the past year due to injury			2
solid : @entity86 man @entity196 ( left ) has enjoyed a productive but unspectacular tournament so far verdict : @entity182 strikes fear into the heart of opponents , and it works			0
central midfield @entity208 ( @entity209 ) – age 29 , caps 10 , international goals 2 has improved with age and was a key player for @entity209 in their title - winning season , but still very inexperienced in international football , especially for someone pushing 30			0
getting stuck in : @entity208 ( right ) showed off the physical side of his game against @entity220 ( left ) when @entity5 met @entity40 @entity221 ( @entity42 ) – age 29 , caps 106 , international goals 23 he brings on to the pitch a wealth of experience and a decent scoring rate from central midfield			2
has looked happier being the leader of the midfield again with @entity70 's switch back to right - back			0
experienced : @entity221 already has 106 caps and 23 goals for his country verdict : @entity221 has 10 times as many caps as @entity208 , despite being the same age , and is one of the most accomplished in the world at his position			0
@entity244 ( @entity245 ) – age 27 , caps 39 , international goals 9 known for his pile - driver of a shot , but has still never scored for @entity5 in a competitive match			1
his performances have been erratic in this tournament			0
room for improvement : forward @entity244 is yet to open his account for @entity5 at the @entity2 @entity258 ( @entity42 ) – age 24 , caps 54 , international goals 21 his @entity2 finals record says it all : 11 played , nine won , just one lost , having scored nine goals			2
danger man : @entity258 ( left ) , pictured here scoring against the @entity265 , has four goals to his name in @entity5 verdict : @entity258 is far superior in almost every way			2
the @entity69 wins this easily			0
@entity270 ( @entity137 ) – age 22 , caps 36 , international goals 10 @entity270 's form dipped midway through the season for @entity137 and that has carried into the @entity2			2
he has sporadically played well but has been far too erratic			0
the @entity277 will be looking to him to raise it with @entity279 out			2
expectation : @entity270 ( left ) will need to embrace more creative responsibility with talisman @entity279 out injured @entity281 ( @entity42 ) – age 24 , caps 49 , international goals 5 his passing ability is immense , but does n't seem to score the amount of goals his position should warrant			1
and that is strange , as his goal against @entity199 in the @entity292 demonstrated his shooting prowess			0
pass master : @entity42 's @entity281 ( front ) will look to dictate play from the centre of midfield verdict : a tough one to call , but @entity281 edges it			0
his performances have been better in this tournament than @entity270 's			0
left attacking midfield @entity304 ( @entity137 ) – age 25 , caps 10 , international goals 2 likely to be drafted into the side with @entity279 out injured			1
has featured little in the early rounds , coming on as a late subsitute three times			0
chance : @entity137 midfielder @entity304 is expected to replace the injured @entity279 in @entity5 's starting xi @entity312 ready to fill @entity279 's boots @entity314 ( @entity199 ) – age 25 , caps 60 , international goals 18 the @entity199 man has had a quiet tournament , much like his first season in @entity320 football			1
whenever he gets the ball it feels like something will happen , and then it does n't			0
time to deliver : @entity314 ( left ) has failed to shine for his country but he could play a major part for @entity95 's side verdict : @entity314 has to get this one , merely because @entity304 has barely played any football in the competition			2
striker @entity331 ( @entity332 ) – age 30 , caps 38 , international goals 18 @entity32 has defended @entity331 resolutely amid criticism for his lack of goals – just one , a header from an offside position two yards out – and overall play			0
flop : striker @entity331 has scored once so far but has put in a series of poor performances for the @entity5 @entity343 ( @entity344 ) – age 36 , caps 135 , international goals 70 one of the greatest strikers in @entity2 history			0
needs just one goal , playing in his fourth @entity2 , to become outright top - scorer in the tournament 's history ahead of @entity355			0
motivation : @entity343 ( right ) needs just one goal against @entity5 to become the @entity2 's all - time leading scorer verdict : @entity343 ; no question .			1

hosts @entity5 take on @entity6 in @entity10 for a place in the final
@entity32 will be without the injured @entity279
@entity137 midfielder @entity304 is expected to replace the @entity60 star
@entity6 could be *unchanged* from their quarter - final win against @entity49
