by @entity1 reporter published : 07:35 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 06:25 est , 11 may 2012 the daily pill , that could soon be approved by the @entity4 for preventing @entity5 in high - risk patients a pill to prevent @entity5 could soon be available to the public after a panel of @entity11 federal advisers voted to endorse its approval yesterday			1
an approval would be a major breakthrough in the 30 - year campaign against the @entity17 epidemic			0
@entity18 is currently used to treat the virus , but tests have shown it to be safe and effective in healthy people for preventing it			1
the @entity4 concluded that taking the pill daily could spare patients ' infection with a serious and life - threatening illness that requires lifelong treatment '			1
yesterday a panel of @entity4 advisers voted to recommend that @entity18 , which was created by @entity31 , should be approved as a preventative treatment for people who are at high risk of contracting @entity5 through sexual intercourse			1
the @entity4 is not required to follow the advice of its panels , but it usually does			1
an estimated 1.2 million @entity11 have @entity5 , which attacks the immune system and , unless treated with antiviral drugs , develops into @entity17 , a fatal condition in which the body can not fight off infections			1
if @entity18 is approved , it would be a key breakthrough in the 30 - year fight against @entity17			0
there have been no other drugs proven to prevent @entity5 and a vaccine is believed to be decades away			1
however , while the panel of @entity4 advisers backed the pill , concerns were raised during yesterday 's meeting over whether the wide availability of the drug would discourage safe sex and would , in fact , increase the incidence of @entity5			1
the panel also questioned @entity18 's effectiveness in women			0
studies have shown that when used by women the rates of protection were lower			0
@entity31 , based in @entity62 , has marketed @entity18 since 2004 as a treatment for people who are infected with the virus			0
the medication is a combination of two older hiv drugs , @entity69 and @entity70			0
doctors usually prescribe the medications as part of a drug cocktail that makes it harder for the virus to reproduce			0
patients with low viral levels have reduced symptoms and are far less likely to develop @entity17			0
researchers first reported that @entity18 could prevent people from contracting @entity5 in 2010			1
a three - year study found that daily doses cut the risk of infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 44 percent , when accompanied by condoms and counseling			1
the drug can help prevent a person becoming infected with @entity5 a separate study found that @entity18 reduced infection by 75 percent in heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected with @entity5 and the other was not			1
because @entity18 is already on the market to manage @entity5 , some doctors already prescribe it as a preventive measure			1
but @entity4 approval would allow the drugmaker @entity31 to formally market its drug for that use			1
@entity4 reviewers on tuesday said that patients must be diligent about taking the pill every day if using it as a preventative measure			2
adherence to the medication was less than perfect in clinical trials , and reviewers said that patients in the real world may forget to take their medication even more than those in clinical studies			0
some patient advocacy groups say the drug is an important new option to prevent @entity5 , alongside condoms , counseling and other measures			1
last month , advocacy group @entity121 and more than a dozen other groups sent a letter to the @entity4 , urging approval of @entity18			2
' if we 're going to reduce the more than 50,000 new hiv infections in this country each year , we need to increase the available options for people , ' said @entity130 , @entity121 's vice president			2
but support for @entity4 approval is not unanimous			2
although the @entity4 is legally barred from considering cost when reviewing drugs , health care providers have raised concerns about @entity18 's price tag : $ 900 a month , or just under $ 11,000 per year			2
@entity137 and @entity138 , the nation 's largest health insurance plans , generally cover drugs approved by the @entity4 , and analysts expect most large health insurers to follow suit			2
additionally , some researchers say the prevention pill is not the chemical equivalent of condoms , which they say remain the best weapon against @entity17			0
they also worry about @entity18 's mixed success rate in preventing infection among women			0
last year , a study in women was stopped early after researchers found that women taking the drug were more likely to become infected than those taking placebo			0
researchers speculated that women may require a higher dose of the drug to prevent infection			0
they also said the disappointing results may have resulted from women not taking the pills consistently			0
' we know that if the person does n't take the medication every day they will not be protected , ' said dr. @entity170 , director of @entity5 programs at @entity172 in @entity173			2
' so the concern is that there may not be adequate adherence to provide protection in the general population			0

@entity4 panel voted to endorse the drug yesterday
would be prescribed to healthy people who are at high risk of contracting @entity5
some argue the wide availability of such a drug would discourage safe sex and increase incidence of @entity5
