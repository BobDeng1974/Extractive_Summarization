by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 15:39 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 16:28 est , 22 april 2013 it was n't too long ago that the idea of @entity4 vocally supporting a long - term citizenship outlook for oft - derided ' illegals ' would have send pundits and editors scrambling to be sure it was n't @entity10			1
and if anti-immigration conservatives thought the april 15 @entity14 bombings would derail talk in @entity1 of immigration reform , they did n't count on @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , the @entity20 , or an obscure @entity4 lobbyist named @entity22			1
while @entity23 and @entity18 are n't talking , both @entity20 and @entity25 - @entity17 's group - say it should n't shock anyone that they favor a quasi-amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants			1
@entity20 , the libertarian think - tank , is an unabashed supporter of liberalizing immigration law but typically has limited influence among red - meat - eating @entity4 policymakers			1
@entity17 , the @entity4 anti-tax crusader , has long been known in @entity1 for being - as one think - tank lobbyist who requested anonymity put it to @entity38 on monday - ' squishy on the immigration issue , in a way that makes lots of right - wingers nervous			1
' that squishiness , it seems , is driving @entity4 in - fighting and casting @entity17 as he black sheep in an increasingly immigration - aimless @entity4			1
@entity17 , president of @entity25 , is a reliable conservative voice against tax hikes , but a surprising cheerleader , to some , on immigration reform @entity18 , a @entity51 senator whose parents escaped @entity54 's regime , is the leading @entity4 light on a bipartisan plan to shift @entity58 's immigration frame in the direction of granting gradual amnesties to illegal immigrants			1
@entity18 , @entity63 sen. @entity62 , and @entity64 sen. @entity19 have raised hackles among party loyalists for reaching compromises some see as a prelude to runaway amnesty			1
@entity19 is telling tv audiences that the bombing should increase demands for an organized , government - led mainstreaming of immigrants without documents			2
he said on @entity76 that the @entity78 bombing was another reason to ' bring all of the 11 million ' illegal immigrants living in the @entity58 ' out of the shadows and find out who they are			2
' and @entity18 , through the mysterious lobbyist and would - be lever - puller @entity22 , endorsed a set of emailed talking points that attempted to undo any damage the @entity78 bombing may have done to pro-immigration efforts			1
sen. @entity19 says immigration reform would bring bad actors like the @entity93 ' so the government can ' find out who they are			1
' @entity51 sen. @entity18 's talking points argue that the @entity78 bombers ' came here under the existing system ' and ' did n't cross the border ' illegally to enter the @entity58 @entity23 's email , titled ' talkers from @entity18 , was in part a result of working during the previous days with @entity20 and @entity25			1
' @entity18 talking points re : @entity78 terrorists vis a vis immigration reform ' was its headline			1
' these terrorists came here under the existing system , the one opponents of reform want to leave in place , ' the first message point said , followed by the observation that the terrorist brothers from @entity117 ' did n't cross the border ' illegally to enter the @entity58			0
' the reason we know who they are is because they were here legally , ' @entity18 's talking points added			2
' if they were here illegally , living in the shadows , it would have made them much harder to investigate			0
the fact is that today there are 11 million people already in this country and we do n’t know who they are , why they ’re here , and what they ’re doing			0
that is not only an economic problem , it ’s a huge national security problem as well			0
' @entity23 , who sent the email to a coalition of groups on the right side of the political spectrum , was briefly a @entity20 lobbyist - ' she was here for a few blinks of an eye , ' one @entity20 employee told @entity38 - and has also lobbied on immigration issues for @entity149 , a @entity151 - based immigrants ' rights group			1
she is also a former top lobbyist at the @entity152 , placing her at the center of a small @entity4 movement to break away from the party 's historic opposition to full citizenship for illegal immigrants			1
vast left - wing conspiracy ? @entity161 ( l to @entity162 ) @entity160 , @entity163 and @entity164 conferred during monday 's @entity166 hearing on immigration reform			1
liberals favor a plan to set 11 million illegal immigrants on a path to full citizenship			0
four prominent @entity4 - and at last a few ordinarily right - wing think tanks - have joined them @entity23 's brief cameo in the immigration chronicle of 2013 as a go - between - she 's a minor enough figure to make publishable photographs impossible to find - is an example of the obscure centers of gravity now found in a debate where strange bedfellows have become the norm			1
the conservative blog @entity184 has published excerpts of emails between @entity23 and immigration policy leaders at both @entity20 and @entity25 , along with @entity23 's talking - points missive			1
those messages , which appeared on the @entity191 ' website , seem to outline a plan to help push the so - called ' @entity193 ' immigration bill through @entity195 by crafting testimony from @entity17 in a way that sidesteps the @entity78 massacre while asking other groups to carry messages about the attacks that favor the ' @entity193 ' legislation			1
@entity17 deputy @entity203 had choice words for the @entity206 online publishing empire and its choice of a headline that claimed his group ' use [ d ] the @entity78 terror attacks ' to push immigration reform			1
' this is a false , provocative , and disgusting headline that is not at all supported by the story itself , ' he sniped			0
' to suggest that we are exploiting the tragedy in @entity78 is the opposite of the truth			0
' the @entity222 sniped back			0
' the emails speak for themselves , ' the company told @entity38			0
' those involved could have taken the moral high ground and resisted any politics in the discussion			0
instead they plotted to spin events in favor of the immigration bill			2
' @entity233 of @entity234 , @entity235 , center , with a group called @entity237 , came to the @entity166 hearing to support the ' path ' to citizenship promised to illegal immigrants by president @entity242 one of the emails , sent april 18 , shows culling asking @entity23 for help with testimony that his boss is set to deliver in a @entity166 hearing monday afternoon			2
' i need to push on this , ' @entity203 wrote , referring to questions about how an influx of new @entity58 citizens would affect the already - strained @entity253			0
' [ t ] his is the one question @entity255 [ @entity17 ] may get when testifying that i do n't have a strong answer to			2
can you see if your old boss at @entity20 can help ? ' ' will do			0
... i ’m happy to help w @entity17 's testimony			2
... will work on n [ sic ] the @entity253 stuff first			0
' @entity23 sought help from @entity263 , an immigration policy wonk at @entity20			2
he responded that he was ' meeting with @entity203 [ culling ] later today about this and already sent him a memo pertaining to it			0
the @entity78 thing could derail this big time			0
' former @entity64 sen. @entity268 , who now leads the influential right - wing @entity269 , argued in a @entity271 op - ed on april 17 that creating millions of new citizens will ultimately require a bank - breaking explosion of government entitlements			0
' as soon as any of the nearly 11 million unauthorized immigrants are given legal status , the political fight will turn to speeding their transition to citizenship and promises of a full array of federal benefits , ' he wrote			0
' big government , ' a conservative website launched by the right - wing firebrand @entity206 and maintained by his media company after his shocking death in 2012 , accused @entity25 and the @entity20 of colluding with lobbyist @entity22 to help maneuver republicans to the left on immigration @entity203 of @entity25 ( @entity293 ) asked lobbyist @entity22 for help massaging @entity17 's arguments about immigration and @entity253 , a task for which she turned to @entity263 ( r ) , an immigration expert with the @entity20 ultimately , @entity17 submitted testimony to the @entity166 that focused on the benefits of flexible labor opportunities as government opens up the market to workers who were previously off the radar			1
' allowing undocumented workers to move from job to job , travel easily and safely , search out and interview for different jobs in different sectors and locations would greatly increase their productivity , ' @entity17 will say , according to his prepared remarks , ' and they would become greater contributors to their own well - being and the wealth of our nation			2
' overall , @entity17 's group favors enlarging the tax base by adding new taxpayers , rather than the increase of income tax rates for everyone			2
but his testimony does n't directly address the idea of what will happen when new citizens retire by the millions			0
instead he criticizes other @entity4 by saying they have failed to embrace a ' dynamic ' approach to predicting what a pro-immigrant @entity58 will look like a generation from now			0
those conservatives are ' exaggerating public benefit costs ' , predicting ' impossible levels of immigrant use , ' ' assuming immigrant wages will remain stagnant , ' and ' conceding the size of the current welfare state , rather than working to reform it			0
' members of @entity343 , an immigrants ' rights group , brought emotion to an outdoor rally as the @entity166 hearing proceeded inside a @entity20 insider told @entity38 on background that its alliance with @entity17 's group is n't a big deal , but conceded that it 's odd to find the conservative firebrand carrying water for libertarians			1
culling , the @entity25 government affairs expert , told @entity38 much the same thing through a spokesman			0
' it is no secret that @entity25 is supportive of the current immigration reform effort , ' he said			1
' it is also no secret that we are working with other conservatives who support the bill			0
' @entity23 did n't respond to emailed questions			0
@entity18 's press secretary offered no comment .			2
