ever wondered how good you look in bed ? well now you can have the answer			0
an app on @entity4 called glance will soon allow users to see sex from your partner 's point of view			1
with the addition of your phone , you can also see what sex looks like from another angle in the room			0
glance app will stream the view from your partner 's @entity20 glasses to yours			1
users can also record the view to watch back later on an @entity24			1
it claims to bring a completely new perspective on personal experiences to get started , a couple who are both wearing @entity20 glasses will have to say ' ok , glass , it 's time			1
' the technology will then stream what they are seeing to each other			2
to end the session , the person wearing the glasses just needs to say , ' @entity39 , pull out			2
' the app was created by a team of three people , who came up with the idea during a hackathon in @entity45 at the end of last year			2
since @entity4 were invented , a range of apps have been designed to enhance the product ( picture posed by model ) they said of the invention : ' @entity55 ’s you see two different perspectives , seamlessly			1
it changes the way you experience something personal			0
' it ’s an experiment			0
we are learning on the fly			0
having sex with glance brings a completely new perspective			2
' the new @entity66 app will give men and women the opportunity to see what they look like in bed ( picture posed by models ) anyone who wants to watch the footage back for a critique can also save the stream as a film			1
but the inventors are keen to point out that they have strict privacy guidelines and all footage is only available on individual phones , not on the app database			2
they said : ' your videos belong to you			0
couples will be able to record the view from their glasses straight onto their phone to watch back later ( picture posed by models ) ' that ’s why we ’ve decided to upload anything to the cloud			1
and not host any videos			0
not only that , but if you leave the app , everything disappears forever			0
' unless you deliberately save to your camera roll , everything is wiped			0
' the @entity4 app has n't launched yet , but it is now available as an app on the @entity24 .			1
