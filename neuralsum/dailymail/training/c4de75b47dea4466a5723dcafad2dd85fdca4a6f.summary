in the space of one frantic fortnight , @entity0 has been exposed to the brilliance and brutality of life as a professional footballer			1
on sunday afternoon , as the rookie goalkeeper makes his full home debut in a @entity10 , you get the feeling his experience will swing across the perilous pendulum which divides those two extremes			1
to recap , the 21 - year - old was an unknown without a wikipedia page two weeks ago when he emerged from the backbenches of the dugout at @entity19 to first flatten @entity20 and then perform heroics as @entity22 became the first team to beat @entity24 since april			1
young @entity22 goalkeeper @entity0 will experience the intensity of @entity10 on sunday then , at @entity26 , he shipped four on live television and suffered the humiliation of @entity30 ’s ‘ @entity37 ’ penalty , a cheeky chip straight down the middle which does little for the confidence of any goalkeeper , let alone one making his first @entity36 start			1
and so to @entity38 at the other end of the @entity40 where his fortunes fared even worse			1
again , four were conceded , only this time he was at fault for two and picked up a shoulder injury			0
he has been on the back pages of national newspapers for reasons which span good and bad			0
that , after all , is the existence of a professional footballer			0
today , however , represents an entirely different proposition			0
eight goals at @entity26 and @entity38 will be forgotten with the passage of time			1
@entity59 derbies , however , are etched in @entity61 folklore for eternity – just ask @entity63 , he scored a winning free - kick for @entity22 at @entity65 in 1992 and has n’t had to buy a drink on @entity67 since			1
@entity0 , then , would be forgiven for carrying a few nerves with him as he journeys along the @entity69 from his @entity71 home and across the water to @entity19 ’			1
@entity0 has been passed fit despite injurying his shoulder during the 4 - 0 defeat against @entity38 @entity75 is well aware of the exposure and expectancy surrounding the young custodian , who has been passed fit following his shoulder scare			1
‘ i have certainly had a chat with him , ’ admits the man who is bidding to avoid becoming the first @entity22 manager in derby history to suffer four straight defeats			1
‘ i would have done that if he had n't made a mistake ( at @entity38 ) because i think it 's important to talk to young players when they are going into the first team			1
‘ i think he was unlucky with his mistake ( dropped his catch from a corner and @entity38 scored ) because he got punished severely with it			2
‘ you can get away with that sometimes , and i have played with much better goalies than @entity0 , without being disrespectful to him , who have got away with it			2
‘ they have dropped it and someone has cleared it , or it was blocked on the line or something , so i explained that to him			0
i think he realised that			0
‘ he was apologetic about the mistake , as you would imagine , but i said to him it 's important not to be too apologetic , that 's it 's gone			0
‘ we make mistakes in other areas and there are all forgotten ; you make a mistake there and it is n't , so he grasped that			0
‘ he 's a local boy , he wants to make amends today in terms of a real performance , and all my squad and my staff , because we like him , will be wishing that happens			0
’ @entity0 is out of contract in the summer and , with @entity128 and @entity129 sidelined until the middle of january , he has a chance to win a new deal			2
stand - in keeper @entity0 injured his shoulder in wednesday night ’s @entity135 defeat at @entity38 either way , @entity75 says the experience will serve the former @entity139 youth keeper well			1
‘ whatever line his career takes , this is going to be a massive period for him , ’ says the boss			0
‘ he did brilliantly against @entity24 , everyone was raving about him			0
now he has had a down - turn against @entity38 and now he has got the other side of the coin , all in the space of eight or nine days , and that is football			2
‘ in a minuscule way , he 's had the experience of what it ’s like to play football at the highest level , and now he needs to respond			0
’ @entity0 , of course , is one half of a goalkeeping family			2
his brother , @entity160 , played for @entity139 and @entity38 and now resides between the posts for @entity162			1
he has every faith in his little brother and was thrilled – if a little panicked – when the call came that @entity0 was coming on at half - time against @entity24			2
@entity22 lost 4 - 0 against @entity38 as @entity0 had a game to forget , gifting two of the goals on wednesday ‘ i knew one of our local pubs had @entity173 so i sprinted down and got there just in time to see @entity0 flatten @entity20 with his first contribution , ’ laughs the 27 - year - old			1
‘ i was shaking just watching him play and all my @entity162 team - mates started texting me and this made me worse			0
goalkeepers like a good first touch and @entity0 seemed to grow a couple of inches at the way he took care of @entity20			2
’ @entity160 , then , is proud of his sibling , if a little envious at the same time			0
‘ on sunday he will be doing something i have dreamed about all my life - playing in a derby match for @entity22 with @entity139 , ’ he says			1
‘ i was actually on the bench for @entity139 at @entity19 in the derby match @entity22 won with that goal from @entity192 in 2005			1
‘ but like all @entity195 lads i would have loved to have played for @entity22			2
it 's been my life - time dream			0
now @entity0 is living my dream			0
’ @entity0 will certainly be hoping his first derby is more dream than nightmare .			0
