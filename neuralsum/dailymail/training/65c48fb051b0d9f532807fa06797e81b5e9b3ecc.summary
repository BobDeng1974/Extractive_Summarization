a @entity1 woman whose story was told by @entity3 last month as evidence the @entity5 is helping @entity6 now says the insurance exchange made a mistake and she ca n’t afford a plan			1
@entity10 was named by the president in a @entity13 speech regarding @entity5 after she wrote a letter to the @entity15 thanking them for helping her get health coverage			1
but last week the 48 - year - old self - employed single mom got a letter saying she was given a lower insurance quote and higher tax credit by the state ’s exchange than she actually qualified for due to a ‘ system error			1
’ still uninsured : @entity10 of @entity1 was named by president @entity3 as an @entity5 success story but after a state 's error was revealed , it turned out she could n't get a plan after all the letter was actually one of several she ’d received from @entity33 , which is the state ’s @entity5 exchange group			1
the first told her of an error regarding her tax credit			2
it had been miscalculated and would be lower than she expected			0
she was disappointed in the uptick in cost for her insurance , but still carried on with her plans to purchase insurance through the exchange at $ 280 per month instead of the original quote of $ 198			1
but the second letter informed her she ’d get no tax credit at all			2
that resulted in an even higher quote of $ 390 per month , which @entity50 told @entity51 she just could n’t afford			1
there was a cheaper , ‘ bronze ’ plan she could buy for $ 324 per month , but with higher deductibles she could n’t afford that either			2
before the hammer fell : in a @entity13 speech , just the pictured pregnant woman famously fell , @entity3 called @entity50 's story , which she emailed to the @entity15 , ' what the @entity5 is all about ' let down : but after receiving several letters from her state exchange about errors regarding her tax credit , it became clear to @entity50 that she could n't afford to buy into the @entity5 @entity50 apologized in the letter and said they were ‘ disappointed to have discovered this issue			1
’ meanwhile , it was just last month when @entity3 stood in the @entity13 and proudly spoke of how the new health insurance exchanges			1
‘ i recently received a letter from a woman named @entity10 in @entity1 , ’ president @entity3 told @entity6 in the october 21 speech			1
‘ here 's what she had to say : i am a single mom , no child support , self - employed and i have n't had insurance in 15 years because it 's too expensive			2
’ ' i wanted health insurance , wanted this to work			0
i want it to work for everybody ' : @entity50 says as it stands she ca n't afford a health plan but blames the state , not the @entity5 as a whole i was crying the other day when i signed up , so much stress lifted			1
’ @entity50 said she wept when she believed she ’d finally be able to afford insurance			1
and again when she learned she actually could n’t because of the state ’s error			0
‘ i was embarrassed , ’ @entity50 told @entity51			0
‘ i had a good cry			2
’ the self - employed court reporter blames the state of @entity1 and its exchange for the issue and says she regrets that @entity3 mentioned her name			1
she voted for @entity3 twice and supports the @entity5 but admits , ‘ they screwed up			2
you guys really screwed me over , ’ @entity50 wrote on the state exchange ’s @entity109 page			2
‘ now i have been priced out and will not be able to afford the plans you offer			0
but , i get to pay $ 95 and up for not having health insurance			0
i am so incredibly disappointed and saddened			0
’ @entity50 who was once so ecstatic to finally be insured is now back to square one			0
i 'm not getting insurance , ’ @entity50 told @entity51			0
‘ that 's where it stands right now unless they fix it			0
’ @entity50 told @entity124 that she 's disappointed in her situation and feels for those sharing in the frustration with her			0
' i wanted health insurance , wanted this to work			0
i want it to work for everybody			0

' i was ecstatic ' : @entity1 woman @entity10 was named by president @entity3 in a @entity13 speech about affordable health care last month after she wrote a letter thanking the @entity15 for helping her afford insurance
' i had a good cry ' : but last week , @entity50 received a letter from the state saying that her insurance rate had been miscalculated and she would n't be receiving a tax credit for buying a plan like she thought
' they screwed up ' : @entity50 says she still supports the affordable care act and blames the insurance exchange in her home state for the error but she wo n't be buying insurance at the rate she 's now been offered
@entity50 was originally quoted a plan of $ 198 per month but after the state 's ' system error ' she was quoted $ 390
