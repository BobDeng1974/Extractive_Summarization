@entity0 celebrated his return to the @entity3 fold with a typical all - action display in their 21 - 16 win over @entity7 , but he ended up red - faced after running into the post instead of diving over for a certain try			1
the @entity12 skipper has been in and out of the @entity3 side for years now , but with injuries piling up in the back row he was given the nod and certainly put his hand up to become a mainstay with a powerful performance at the @entity20			2
but @entity3 were 16 - 15 down and putting @entity7 under intense pressure when @entity0 ran straight into the post in a slapstick moment amid the fury of battle in the @entity28 opener			1
@entity0 ( centre ) was denied a try during @entity3 's 21 - 16 victory over @entity7 on friday night @entity0 ( with the blue scrum cap ) is tackled by @entity7 ' @entity33 into the post protector in @entity35 @entity0 ( blue scrum cap ) bounced back off the post protector at the @entity20 on friday ' i knew i was n't going to get there so i tried to hit and bounce back out and i bounced back into the post unbelievably , but only i could do that , ' he told @entity41			1
in the end it did not matter as fly - half @entity44 booted @entity3 clear with two late penalties and that was a remarkable turnaround after @entity7 raced into a 10 - 0 lead after eight minutes			1
with the @entity35 crowd still dazzled by a fireworks and lights show beforehand , @entity50 's men caught @entity3 cold as @entity54 scampered over and @entity55 added the extras and a penalty			2
but @entity3 built on some mighty work by their forwards as @entity61 backs and @entity28 debutants @entity63 and @entity64 both claimed touchdowns			2
@entity44 added three penalties and a conversion - his second strike after @entity7 wing @entity70 had been sin - binned - while @entity7 failed to score in the second period after another @entity55 penalty and a @entity74 drop - goal had given them what appeared to be a solid advantage			1
@entity33 ( right ) pushes @entity0 into the post as he is prevented from scoring a try for @entity3 @entity0 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity7 ' @entity70 ( left ) as he advances with the ball for @entity3 @entity0 said afterwards that @entity82 's men always believed they were capable of turning things round , adding : ' we 've done a lot of work , there 's a lot of talent in this group , and i think we felt if we stick in the game , keep our discipline and play in the right areas then we were going to get tries			1
' @entity96 once again showcased his talents , remaining cool under pressure to boot over the decisive penalty after @entity3 had given themselves an 18 - 16 lead , and he was just glad to give his side their just rewards for a stellar evening 's work			1
' i just wanted to knock it over for the lads really			0
the performance they put in , especially the pack again , was outstanding so it was the least i could do to kick that , ' he said			0
' we felt comfortable first half			0
we obviously had a bit of a poor start but to come out and score 13 points , the message at half - time was exactly the same as the messages before the game			0
' @entity33 ( obscured ) tackles @entity0 during @entity3 's famous victory at the @entity20 @entity7 boss @entity50 paid tribute to @entity3 's second - half show , despite clear frustrations over his side throwing away the 16 - 8 advantage they held at half - time			1
' give @entity3 credit , i thought they played particularly well in the second half , ' he said			0
' i thought we started the game well and played pretty well in the first half , were reasonably comfortable at half - time , but we were n't able to score points in the second half and that sometimes happens at top - level sport			0
' there was a question mark afterwards over @entity140 being allowed to play the whole game , despite picking up several heavy knocks , and some were questioning if he was showing signs of concussion			0
@entity50 belayed those fears and backed his medical team , adding : ' well that 's part of the medical protocol			0
the medical team would n't have let him back on the field unless they felt 100 per cent confident that he was okay , so you 've got to back your medical team and i have n't spoken to them about it			0
' @entity0 ( second right ) celebrates with @entity3 team - mate @entity156 ( left ) at the final whistle			2
