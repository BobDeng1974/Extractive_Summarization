a couple who renewed their vows to celebrate their 25th anniversary saw their celebrations come to an abrupt end after it was gatecrashed by up to 40 men and the wife ended up thrown on the floor			1
@entity11 , 50 , spent two years planning and saving up in secret to celebrate her wedding anniversary with husband @entity14 by renewing their vows at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , where they had married in 1989			1
but the celebrations afterwards at the @entity21 turned were ruined when a group of drunken men , who had earlier been exposing themselves in the street , tried to force their way in			1
mr @entity26 , 53 , described the group as a violent ' pack of animals ' and said he feared if they had managed to get into the reception elderly people and children could have been hurt			1
his wife was thrown to the floor in her wedding dress as she attempted to stop the men			1
they were exposing themselves and being disgusting in front of the children so i asked them to stop , ' said mrs @entity11			1
' the next thing i knew i was thrown to the ground			2
' mr @entity26 said his grandchildren , aged between five and 13 , had alerted him to what was happening outside after they saw the men out of a window			1
' there were four or five of them with their trousers and pants down waving their private parts , and one with just his socks on , ' said the 53 - year - old			0
' i went outside and could not believe my wife had been flung to the ground in her white wedding dress			1
she had asked the men to behave themselves			2
' mr @entity26 had gone outside to get reception on his mobile phone to call police but by the time he returned around 40 drunken men had appeared and were trying to force their way up the stairs			1
police had to be called after around 40 drunken brawlers tried to gatecrash and threw mrs @entity11 to the floor the couple married 25 years ago and decided to renew their vows at the same place as their wedding in 1989 guests tried to stop them , one suffering broken fingers and another having his glasses smashed			1
mr @entity26 added : ' we had children at the function , along with some elderly guests and many were really scared by what was happening			1
these men were so violent it was unbelievable			2
they were like a pack of animals			2
it was like a full - blown riot			0
' because they could n't get in one of the men pushed my wife over			0
' a few people were injured			0
a friend of mine got a couple of broken fingers while another friend was injured on his elbow and had his glasses smashed			1
' another had a black eye			0
a few women who had been outside smoking at the time also were injured when they got caught up in it			0
' if they had got in more people would have been hurt			0
the main concern was to keep these blokes downstairs			0
there were children and people in their seventies upstairs			0
there was also lots of glass			0
if they had got in they would have wrecked the place			0
' mr @entity26 called police on the non-emergency 101 service but after police took 20 minutes to arrive he said he wished he had used 999			1
mr @entity26 said doormen from three other pubs in the town , who had heard about the trouble , arrived to help them			1
the couple , who have been married 25 years , wanted to celebrate with a service similar to their wedding he added : ' we really want to thank the people from @entity17 , who heard about what was happening , and came up from the town and kept these blokes out of our venue			1
' mr @entity26 said the brawl did ruin the celebrations as most guests started to leave after the incident			1
he had not known about the event until he walked into the church as his wife had spent two years planning it in secret - inviting family he had not seen in years , including his 18 month old granddaughter that he had never met			2
mr @entity26 added : ' it was all a complete surprise for me			1
' @entity11 had been planning it for two years , putting a bit of money away now and again			2
' she got my two sons down from @entity177 and my grandchildren to come			0
' i did n't know anything about it until i walked into the church			0
my friend has just had a son and had asked me to be a godparent so i thought that 's why i was going to the church			0
' it was a bit emotional			0
' mr @entity26 said he was very angry that police had not done anything to prevent the incident as he had heard at 4.30pm that day that a group of men were causing trouble			1
he added : ' these men were already playing up , behaving appallingly , hours before and yet they were allowed to stay in @entity17 getting more and more rowdy			2
' they were turned away from loads of pubs			0
why the hell did the police allow them to keep drinking for three or four hours more ? they should have got them out of @entity17 and then this would never have happened			2
' i am totally disappointed in the police			0
they wo n't tell us where those men were from , and they did not even go into the club to take statements			0
their only concern was getting them on the bus out of @entity17			2
' after the service on november 9 , mrs @entity11 posted on @entity214 : ' @entity11 and @entity26 qould like to say a huge thank you to everyone that made our day so special yesterday it was the best day ever , thank you to for the fantastic venue , thank you to tosh , @entity222 and staff at the exservicemen 's club			1
thank you to the doormen from the bush and @entity17 house for helping out with the thugs that tried to get in			2
' temporary chief inspector @entity231 said ' officers were at the scene within a couple of minutes of getting reports ' and the incident was dealt with ' swiftly ' and ' robustly '			0
he added : ' the priority was to ensure matters did not escalate , which is why a large group of visiting men were placed on a bus and removed			1
' but details of all those involved were taken , and although no complaints of assault were received at the time , inquires will continue to establish whether any offences took place			0
