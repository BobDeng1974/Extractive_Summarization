by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 13:25 est , 22 march 2013 @entity3 : 14:26 est , 31 december 2013 president @entity4 famously promised in early 2009 to close the @entity1 military 's detention facility at @entity7 , @entity8 within 12 months			1
but new defense secretary @entity9 is instead considering a proposal from his top commanders to spend $ 195.7 million renovating it and erecting a new prison building			2
the new construction would include $ 49 to house high - value targets like @entity15 , the mastermind behind the 9/11 terror attacks , whose initial detention and interrogation was handled by the @entity19			1
the @entity20 reported that it would likely replace @entity21 7 , the oft - rumored but never acknowledged installation for those ' special ' detainees			0
@entity25 and @entity26 detainees have been housed at the @entity7 military prison since at least 2002 , and are always surrounded by heavily armed security forces president @entity4 ( @entity29 ) promised in the first days of his administration in 2009 to close the @entity31 at @entity7 during his first year in office			1
but the facility has become a money pit , says retired @entity1 air force colonel @entity35 ( r ) , formerly the chief military prosecutor at the prison on the island of @entity8 @entity1 soldiers escort a detainee out of an interrogation hut on the @entity41			1
nearly 800 ' enemy combatants ' have been acknowledged as current or former detainees there , according to human rights groups general @entity46 , who leads the @entity1 military 's @entity47 , testified in a congressional hearing wednesday that with no end to the prison 's operation in sight , repairs and upgrades are needed			1
retired air force col. @entity35 , a former chief prosecutor at the @entity7 base , said in a separate interview with @entity58 that the @entity1 military spends $ 120 million annually ' just on the recurring costs of keeping the detainees there			1
' the @entity20 reported that the @entity64 funding request includes $ 99 million for two new barracks facilities and a new mess hall costing $ 12 million			1
military planners also want to reduce the frequent prisoner transportation around the base by placing new legal , medical and communications facilities at central locations in the main detention camps			0
the existing facilities , col. @entity35 said , ' just were n’t meant to last for 10 or 11 years , ' ' there ’s a lot of money being wasted at @entity7 , ' he added , ' and a lot of our prestige is going down the tubes as well			0
so there 's just no good reason to keep it going			0

@entity91 is a medium - security facility , but others , which house high - value prisoners , confine them alone in virtual isolation guards enter a maximum - security area of the @entity1 military - run @entity99 , meant to house high - value targets and high - profile detainees who may have valuable information that could help the @entity1 government 's global war on @entity87 terror groups protesters including @entity1 , @entity109 and citizens of other @entity84 countries have pressured the @entity113 and @entity4 administrations to close the installation			2
but @entity113 - and , later , @entity4 - reportedly determined that the value of extracting information from terrorists and their confederates outweighed the reputational damage caused by @entity1 holding prisoners indefinitely under circumstances that would be unconstitutional if the detainees were @entity1 citizens			2
in january the @entity4 @entity122 reassigned @entity123 , the special envoy for closing the @entity8 prison , and determined that it would not replace him			1
the administration created @entity123 ’s job in 2009 , shortly after @entity4 took office and promised to close @entity7 within a year			0
the envoy negotiated the repatriation of 31 low - level detainees to their own countries , and convinced other nations to accept about 40 more whose release was approved , but who feared government oppression or other abuse if they returned home			0
