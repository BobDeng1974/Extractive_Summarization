a mother - of - one crippled by her 30 - year phobia of snakes was cured live on tv today in an astonishing ten minutes			1
before today , @entity4 , 39 and based in @entity5 , could not even confront a plastic snake without panicking , and would obsessively check her toilet for the reptiles every day			1
but viewers of @entity11 ’s @entity10 were amazed as therapists @entity12 and @entity14 broke down @entity16 ’s phobia with their no - nonsense approach , which involved ' proving ' to @entity16 that her fear was irrational			1
@entity20 : @entity4 ( centre ) , 39 , was cured of her crippling snake phobia live on tv today by therapists @entity12 and @entity14 in an astonishing ten minutes at the beginning of the show , @entity16 - who was hooked up to a heart monitor throughout - broke down in tears at the mere sight of a plastic snake , which sent her heart rate soaring			1
by the end of the show she was able to touch a real - life 9ft @entity35 python as it stretched out across her lap , leaving hosts @entity39 and @entity41 gob - smacked			0
' it ’s a miracle , ' @entity41 said			0
' the results have been absolutely extraordinary			0
' @entity16 , who is now able to take her seven - year - old daughter on a dream holiday to @entity47 later this year thanks to her treatment , said : ' all my life i ’ve been terrified of snakes			1
' but to sit down with one on my knee is just unbelievable			0
' the @entity53 have now helped 60 people overcome there fears and phobias live on tv , from balloons and snowmen , to frogs and spiders			0
but today ’s was the first time viewers have been able to see the process in action			0
lifelong phobia : @entity16 had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched @entity69 when she was seven years old therapy : when presented with a tray of plastic snakes ( pictured ) she shook with fear and broke down in tears @entity12 said : ' usually we ’ll go into another room away from the cameras , and spend a bit more time with the person and it can take a fair amount of time			1
' but this time we spent just ten minutes going through it with @entity16 , so viewers can see how we did it			2
it was very special as @entity16 was the 60th person we ’ve treated			2
we were thrilled at the result			0
' the @entity53 had never met @entity16 , from @entity5 until five minutes before the show and knew nothing about her phobia until they saw a @entity94 recorded in @entity16 ’s home , showing how her life was being blighted by her phobia , known as ophidiophobia			2
@entity16 had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched @entity69 when she was seven years old , she explained			1
' if i see a snake on tv , i immediately have to get my feet up , the tv turned over			0
then i ’ll go to bed that night i ’ll be checking under the covers			0
' i also check in the wardrobe where we keep all the shoes because you just never know , they could be hiding in there			0
i ’ll check in my boots , give them a wee shake , make sure there ’s nothing in there			0
' @entity117 : @entity16 used to compulsively check her home for snakes , and would frequently shake her boots to make sure they were n't hiding any @entity39 asked her : ' do you find it irrational ? i do n’t know when a snake was last found in a loo in @entity5			1
' @entity16 replied : ' yes			2
but i read a story in a newspaper once that someone had found a pet snake in the toilet , so ever since then i ’ve checked			0
' @entity16 was then asked by @entity39 to scribble down the word snake on a piece of paper - sending her heart rate soaring from 90 to over 130			2
she was also shown clips of @entity137 with a snake slithering over him in the i ’m a celebrity jungle , as well as having to confront a tray of plastic toy snakes which made @entity16 shake with fear and break down in tears			1
@entity14 continued the session by getting @entity16 to concede that her fear of snakes was indeed irrational , before pointing out the irony that in hunting for snakes around the house , she was seeking out her fear			1
irrational ? @entity16 also used to check under the loo seat every time she was about to use it , despite living in @entity5 , which is not known for it 's teeming serpent population ' what ’s happened is that you watched a film when you were seven years old and you reacted and created a schema , ' @entity14 explained			1
' the reason you now react irrationally is because you ’re actually consulting a seven - year - old on how to react when you see a snake			0
' @entity16 was then asked to talk about @entity166 , the horror movie which ignited her fear of snakes in the first place , in which a snake kills everyone involved			1
@entity12 then asked : ' so just from that one event , watching that film you ’re frightened of snakes ? ' you ’ve been scratched by your cat but you 're not frightened of it			1
what ’s a snake ever done to you ? ' he added : ' you ’re frightened of something that ’s never hurt you , something that you ’ve never physically held , that you only saw in a film when you were seven years of age			2
does that make sense ? ' essentially , for 30 years , you have victimised snakes for no reason at all			2
' relief : after accepting that her fear of snakes was irrational , @entity16 was able to touch a real - life 9ft @entity35 python as it stretched out across her lap logic : @entity14 ( right ) explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear the @entity53 then held up a series of pictures of snakes to test @entity16 ’s reaction			1
to everyone 's amazement she remained calm and said : ' i can look at it			0
' @entity12 remarked : ' this is the difference between seeing a snake through the eyes of a 30 - odd year - old woman and not a seven - year - old child			2
you ’re looking confused right now			0
' that ’s because you 've spent 30 years believing something that essentially is not true			0
' @entity16 was then presented with a tank of live snakes , and admitted that although ' bizarre ' , she was no longer has a phobia of them			1
at the end of the show , producers brought out a giant , 9ft - long @entity35 python which laid across the laps of @entity16 and @entity232 ’s , with @entity16 stroking the python			2
remarkably , her heart rate stayed below 100			0
' i never thought i ’d be able to hold one , ' she said			0
@entity14 explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear			1
she added : ' it ’s about proving to the person that their fears are completely irrational			1

@entity4 , 39 , had been petrified of snakes since the age of 9
she shook and cried when presented with a plastic one
therapists @entity12 and @entity14 cured her with ' logic '
they made @entity16 realise her fear was completely irrational
