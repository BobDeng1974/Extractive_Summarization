although it is also registered by the @entity109 , the quest for adventure is a tourist ship			2

he spent two weeks with us			0
’ @entity18 is a former commander of @entity83 ( pictured ) and was awarded an obe for his service in 2009 saga spokesman @entity133 said the company had met the costs of the cruise as part of the deal with the @entity4			1
‘ the @entity4 officers who travel with us from time to time are shadowing and observing our crews			2
this is a job of work , so we pay the cost			0
we paid for commander @entity18 and his wife but we do not pay his wages			1
’ commander @entity18 is paid between £ 70,000 and £ 78,000 a year			1
the @entity70 insisted that the trip did not involve additional costs to the taxpayer			0
the @entity70 also stressed that he paid for his and his wife ’s flights to @entity36 to meet the ship and their return journeys to @entity87			2

secretary of the @entity157 branch of the @entity158 , @entity159 , said : ‘ when i served in the 1960s , we sailed on our own ships			0
i do n’t think there was ever time for those sort of jollies			0
‘ i would defend senior officers , though			0
perhaps they deserve a period of relaxation			0
’ last night , a @entity70 spokeswoman said : ‘ the aim of the @entity76 is to foster good relations between the @entity4 and @entity109 , providing officers with experience of @entity109 operations and encouraging @entity109 liaison in @entity177 matters			2
’ an earlier version of this article said commander @entity18 ’s wife , @entity180 , had gone with him on the trip			1
in fact the commander is divorced from @entity180 and he was accompanied by his new wife .			2
