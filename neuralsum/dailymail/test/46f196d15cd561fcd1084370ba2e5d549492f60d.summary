labour leader @entity0 read from motivational notes during the leaders ’ televised debate he was widely criticised for his robotic performance in last week ’s debate as he failed to land a convincing blow on @entity7			1
now it has emerged @entity0 was reading from motivational notes during the leaders ’ clash – including one reminding him to be a ‘ happy warrior ’			1
his cribsheet prompts him to turn a ‘ negative ’ into a ‘ positive ’ and reveals he had planned a number of the put - downs he used on @entity7 – such as , on the deficit : ‘ does that sound familiar ? well , it should , because he said it five years ago			1
’ the @entity21 leader urges himself to ‘ stay calm , never agitated ’ and ‘ relish the chance to show who i am ’			1
his scrawled notes , found in his dressing room after the @entity27 debate , give an insight into his mindset before he took to the rostrum with the six other party leaders			1
mr @entity0 reminds himself to talk to the camera , ‘ use the people at home ’ and get across his ‘ decency , passion , leadership ’			1
the @entity21 leader reveals his planned ripostes to two possible @entity40 attacks , accusing him of forgetting the deficit and of telling journalists he wanted to ‘ weaponise ’ the issue of the @entity44			1
he accuses the prime minister of promising to eliminate the deficit and failing , and urges viewers to ‘ use their vote as a weapon to fight for the @entity44 by kicking @entity7 out of @entity51 ’			0
but some of the planned one - liners against his @entity40 rival were not used , including : ‘ i can take five more weeks of attacks of me , but the @entity57 people ca n’t take five more years of you			2
’ @entity40 mp @entity59 said such ‘ marketing speak ’ was ‘ cringe - worthy ’ , adding : ‘ @entity0 is looking increasingly bizarre			1
' first he forgets the deficit , then he forgets his notes in the dressing room			0
marketing speak like “ happy warriors ” is very much the tactic of motivational gurus … i think most people will think it ’s cringe - worthy			1
a poll by headhunters @entity97 yesterday found 70 per cent of @entity99 chairmen think @entity21 would herald an ‘ economic catastrophe ’			2
a @entity99 boss , who did not wish to be named , said mr @entity0 ‘ appears to completely misunderstand business ’			2
it comes after mr @entity0 drew ridicule for declaring ‘ hell yeah ! ’ when asked by @entity105 in the first tv election clash if he was tough enough to be prime minister			2
‘ happy warrior ’ was coined by @entity108 to describe admiral @entity109			1
in a 1985 presidential address , @entity111 called on @entity113 to be ‘ happy warriors , out to seize back a country ’			0
mr @entity0 staked the success of his campaign on having a head to head debate with @entity7 , and is understood to have been rehearsing for months			1
he hired @entity113 speech coach @entity120 on a reported £ 10,000 daily fee to improve his delivery and charisma			0
so , what does all this psychobabble actually mean ? what do all the weird soundbites on @entity0 ’s crib sheet mean ? here , the @entity129 analyses them – and reveals the pervasive influence of @entity0 ’s @entity113 spin doctor			2
‘ @entity133 ’ coined by @entity108 , it ’s the title of an 1806 poem to mark @entity109 ’s death			0
happy warrior depicts its subject as a swashbuckling hero who suffers great setbacks and pain , yet proves impossible to defeat			1
this may make it an odd slogan for a modern election , yet in @entity113 , home to @entity21 ’s strategist @entity147 , the phrase has a long history			2
first used by @entity150 in 1924 , presidential candidate @entity149 plastered it across his campaign jet in 1968			0
it has since been used by politicians desperate to be seen as trustworthy , hard - working men - of - the - people			0
in 2012 , @entity157 described his running mate @entity158 as ‘ @entity113 ’s happy warrior ’ , in a speech written by @entity147			1
‘ relish the chance to show who i am ’ the sort of phrase a bull - necked @entity166 might shout while doing press - ups in a muddy puddle , this is old - fashioned motivational psychobabble			0
undoubtedly another contribution from @entity147 , who is big on ego - boosting statements of intent			0
indeed , he must have been behind @entity0 ’s decision to puff up his chest and tell @entity105 last month : ‘ am i tough enough ? hell yes , i ’m tough enough ! ’ as to what sort of a guy @entity0 intends to ‘ relish ’ showing us he is , his notes contain three words : ‘ decency , passion , leadership ’			1
@entity21 leader @entity0 leaves @entity186 in @entity187 following the televised leaders ' election debate ‘ calm , never agitated ’ @entity147 famously labelled @entity157 ‘ no drama @entity157 ’ , kitting out staff in t - shirts with the logo ‘ stop the drama , vote @entity157 ’			1
the reason : although election campaigning can be confrontational , voters prefer candidates who remain above the fray and , well , prime ministerial			0
@entity0 is thus at pains not to lose his cool			2
‘ use the people at home ’ ever since 1960 , when @entity206 faced @entity207 in @entity113 ’s first presidential tv debate , this has been a golden rule			0
@entity206 captured hearts and minds by appearing to talk directly to voters			0
the pale , sweaty @entity207 failed to look at the camera and thereby seemed shifty			0
@entity0 has been practising such drills for weeks – with some rehearsals said to have taken place with @entity218 ’s ex-spin doctor @entity217 playing the anchorman			2
‘ negative into positive ’ this may seem to be yet more transatlantic psychobabble but it is a key tool to try to turn perceived weaknesses to your advantage			0
@entity0 has made self - deprecating jokes – such as one about how he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich – to turn a negative into a positive			1
similarly , he has attempted to transform his status as underdog by saying : ‘ people have underestimated me at every turn			0
’ after four opinion polls were released , the average poll of polls put @entity7 narrowly ahead on 22 per cent , with 21.5 per cent saying @entity0 won , 21 per cent backing @entity237 and 20 per cent favouring miss @entity238 ‘ @entity239 , values ’ crucial buzzwords			2
interestingly , the word ‘ decency ’ cropped up in @entity246 actor @entity245 ’s filmed endorsement of @entity21			1
also , campaign guru @entity147 ’s autobiography is peppered with references to ‘ decency and small - town values ’			0
while working for @entity157 , he told him to say he was ‘ led not by polls but by principle ’			0
the note suggests @entity21 believe ‘ decency ’ , ‘ principle ’ and ‘ values ’ are alien concepts to @entity7			1
typed answers despite wishing to sound spontaneous , several pre-scripted comments were surreptitiously read out from typed notes			0
as for his closing statement , ‘ let ’s bring the change @entity57 needs ’ , it seems a rip - off of the slogan used by @entity157 who , in 2008 , talked endlessly about ‘ change we can believe in ’ .			0
