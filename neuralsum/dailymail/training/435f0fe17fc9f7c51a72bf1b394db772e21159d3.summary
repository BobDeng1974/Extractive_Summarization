by @entity0 a @entity2 - based filmmaker who made a short film last september , entitled @entity4 , in an attempt to work through her latent trauma and improve her love life , says it has done exactly the opposite			1
@entity10 , 28 , made the satirical film , which quickly went viral , in response to her rape , which occurred eight years ago while she was studying in abroad in @entity14			1
' the whole point of making this film was to reclaim my inner goddess , but instead i felt further away from her than ever , ' miss @entity10 writes for @entity19			1
haunted : @entity10 , 28 , ( left ) made a dark comedy film last year in which she explores the effects of her rape , in hopes of exercising her demons and getting her love life back on track the film , in which she plays herself , starts with miss @entity10 bumping into her rapist at the farmer 's market and unfolds as the mostly silent and highly shifty man follows her throughout the rest of her day			1
' dude it 's so crazy running into you , after our unforgettable night on the air mattress , ' she greets him with , in faux surprise			2
as the seven - minute film progresses , miss @entity10 touches on a number of insensitive , but presumably common , responses she receives from people in her life in regards to the dark presence she lugs around with her			1
fancy seeing you here : the satirical film sees miss @entity10 bump into her rapist at a farmer 's market , and is then followed by the creepy man for the rest of the day during a job interview - in which her rapist aggravates her as he eerily stands by her shoulder - her potential boss barks : ' hey , no one here wants an angry woman			1
when you come to work , you hang up your coat and leave your problems on the coat hook			0
' when she confesses the rape to her best friend , she is met with an equally snide reaction : ' but were you , like , really raped ? like , were you drunk ? ' the ditzy blonde questions , before breaking down and sniffing , ' it just hurts because as your best friend , it really affects me			0
' miss @entity10 then introduces her rapist to her parents over lunch			2
not the desired effect : the comedian and filmmaker says that men now avoid her , forcing her to question whether her ' chronic openness ' had officially become ' too much ' for potential mates ' we 've never heard @entity76 talk so much about a boy			2
you must have made quite an impression , ' gushes her mother , adding , ' @entity81 ! ' her last stop is an appointment with her therapist , in which she confides : ' well , [ my rapist ] made me hate my body ... but now i 'm just thin enough to wear leggings as pants			0
' ' fantastic ! ' her syrupy therapist responds , before adopting a patronizing tone and saying : ' i think it 's time to move on			0
so i 'm going to give you a prescription ... to get the f * * * over your s * * * - because honey , no one wants to marry a rape victim			0
' welcome to the family ! in one scene , miss @entity10 introduces her rapist to her parents , who enthusiastically attest that he seems to have made ' quite an impression ' on their daughter inspired by her own frustrations with not being able to get over her ordeal , miss @entity10 says making the film initially helped her			1
' the movie helped me confront the effect my rape had on my identity , relationships and sexuality , ' she writes , adding that she was ' overwhelmed ' with its reception and the support that came flooding in , particularly from other rape victims			0
her response from men , however , was another story			0
patronizing : mirroring some of her real - life experiences , one scene portrays her fictional therapist saying ' honey , no one wants to marry a rape victim ' heading to the film screening 's after party , excited to ' flirt with some dudes with ironic mustaches ' , she was surprised to find herself overwhelmingly avoided by the men who had seen the film , and was eventually forced to ask herself the question : ' had my chronic openness officially become too much for potential mates ? ' following the party , she describes a wash of polite but awkward interactions with men ; from bad dates - ' is he apologizing on behalf of the male species that i got raped ? ' - to confounded hopefuls - ' my faithful booty call lost my number and my new crush claimed he was moving to @entity153			1
' ultimately , she says , despite the catharsis she has gained from making the film , she realized she was still looking to men to validate her sexuality - an issue she is still dutifully working on			2
all smiles : miss @entity10 has since admitted that while the film was cathartic for her , it did n't change the underlying fact that she was still feeling ' unsexy ' in herself - a problem she continues to explore miss @entity10 has since spoken to @entity164 about why she thinks she was scaring men away			1
' i was feeling unsexy in myself and i was projecting it onto all of these guys , ' she says , adding that for a lot of men ' it 's just too much			2
' ' i donâ € ™ t know if i can blame this all on my rape , ' she remarks			0
it comes out as comical , but there is nothing more shocking than the truth the sparky truth - teller , who identifies herself as a true feminist , says the next hot topic she will be tackling is her eating disorder			0
she admits she was ' in denial ' about her bulimia for a long time , and that she coped with her rape by taking laxatives for a month immediately after her attack			0
miss @entity10 , who says she is currently seeing two therapists , promises to inject the same dark humor into her next project as she did with her @entity4 film			1
' it comes out as comical , but there is nothing more shocking than the truth , ' she says .			0
