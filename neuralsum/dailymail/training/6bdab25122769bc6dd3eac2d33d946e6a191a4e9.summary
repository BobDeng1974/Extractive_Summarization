by @entity0 published : 20:28 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 03:22 est , 12 november 2012 if she really wanted to impress the judges she knew she could n't just rely on her salsa			1
so @entity4 decided to try a little va - va - voom instead			1
and judging from the look on @entity9 's face , it did n't do her any harm			2
take that judges ! a confident @entity4 strips off to reveal skimpiest dress yet if you 've got it , flaunt it ! the newly trim fern with partner @entity17 @entity18 , 55 , started her routine on @entity20 on saturday in a frumpy cleaner 's overall			1
but she soon stripped off before the astonished judges to reveal her skimpiest outfit yet			1
her fringed mini-dress showed off a newly toned figure , honed by hours of rehearsals for the @entity28 show , before she and partner @entity29 , 30 , whirled into a steamy salsa to @entity31 's you 'll be @entity33			1
but their performance was not enough to save them from being voted off the dancefloor on last night 's results show			2
@entity18 bowed out graciously , saying she had enjoyed every moment of ' the best party on the television '			2
after the judges ' score , which placed her second from bottom , was combined with the viewers ' vote , @entity18 had to face the dreaded dance - off against @entity49			2
toned : the hours of @entity20 rehearsals have paid off as @entity18 shows off her new figure hit : the elimination was watched by @entity20 's biggest audience of the series so far the judges voted unanimously to save the @entity57 singer sending @entity18 home , with @entity59 describing the choice as a ' no brainer '			1
' i 'm thrilled to have been part of it , ' she said			2
' my ticket on the train has run out			0
' @entity17 , i 've loved it			0
i would n't have swapped you for anything			0
there have been highs and lows , we 've got to know each other pretty well , and i do adore you			0
' at the top of the leader board on saturday night was presenter @entity78 and her dance partner @entity79			0
after dancing the paso doble she scored 36 out of 40 , the highest score of the series so far			0
however bookmaker @entity83 is making gymnast @entity86 odds - on favourite to win the series			0
her elimination came as @entity20 landed its biggest audience of the series so far as it continued to stomp on @entity92 with two million more viewers			1
the @entity28 show drew 10.4 million viewers on saturday night as its @entity97 rival only managed an average of 8.4 million , even including viewers on its @entity97 catch - up channel			0
no brainer : the judges voted unanimously to keep @entity49 and @entity103 over @entity18 and @entity17 ' i 'm thrilled to have been part of it			1
my ticket on the train has run out '			0

@entity4 is voted off @entity20 despite *wowing* the judges with her newly toned body and sexy salsa
