by @entity0 @entity1 , 14 , was bitten in her shoulder during a school trip at @entity5 theme park police are investigating after a girl of 14 was bitten in her shoulder in a @entity9 - style attack during a school trip			1
@entity1 was left crying in pain , with blood pouring down her back , after being assaulted at the @entity5 theme park , @entity15 , last week			1
the youngster had been waiting for the park ’s @entity18 ride to begin when she accidentally bumped into a middle - aged man			1
although @entity1 apologised immediately , he started swearing and , when the lights dimmed for the ride , she felt him sink his teeth into her right shoulder			1
@entity1 , a pupil at @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , broke down in tears and reported the assault to her teachers			1
they took her for treatment at the park ’s medical centre before reporting it to management			0
last night her father , @entity38 , 45 , said : ‘ @entity1 has been left totally traumatised			1
‘ he has broken the skin and left a terrible bite mark on her shoulder			1
she was crying and there was blood pouring down her back			2
it ’s really nasty and @entity1 has been left very upset and worried about it			1
‘ this whole thing about @entity9 has been in the papers and on everyone ’s mind , it seems a bit of a coincidence that kids have started biting teachers in the playground and now this has happened to @entity1			1
it ’s just vicious and beyond me how an adult could do something like that to a child			0
’ the attack happened at around 4.30pm on thursday as @entity1 and a friend waited for the @entity18 – one of the park ’s newest rides – just before boarding the coach home			1
many of @entity1 ’s friends had gone on the log flume , but she and another friend had decided they did not want to be wet on the journey , so opted to go on @entity18 instead			2
the ride involves around 40 people being lowered into an underground cave with the unhatched egg of an alien creature			0

@entity1 was bitten by the man while she queued for a ride at @entity5 ( pictured ) in @entity15 special effects and lighting then simulate the egg hatching and the creature attacking – much of which takes place in pitch darkness			1
police last night said they would be reviewing @entity94 footage from the park to see if they could identify @entity1 ’s attacker			2
mr @entity38 said he and his wife , @entity97 , 40 , were worried the bite could have left their daughter with a potentially harmful disease			2
the couple , who have four children , have already taken @entity1 to see her gp , but she will have to undergo months of tests before she knows if she is in the clear			2
‘ we ’re trying not to worry @entity1 too much because she has been so stressed out about it , ’ mr @entity38 added			2
‘ but she ’s been to the doctor and has got to have all sorts of tests for hepatitis and @entity112			0
‘ we just want this man caught so we can make sure he ’s not a druggie or anything			0
to be bitten by someone you do n’t know is one of the dirtiest things			0
he left a really nasty bite mark on her shoulder			1
we ’re just worried about the consequences			0
’ @entity123 @entity9 was banned from football for four months after biting @entity126 defender @entity125 on the shoulder during their @entity129 match last month			1
@entity9 was found to have bitten @entity126 's @entity125 on the shoulder ( left ) during their @entity129 game			1
concerns have now been raised the striker 's method of biting is being copied by others			2
