by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 29 may 2013 an @entity2 professor said on wednesday he has identified what he believes is the world 's oldest complete scroll of the @entity6 , containing the full text of the first five books of @entity10 scripture			1
@entity11 , professor of @entity10 at the @entity12 , said experts and carbon dating tests done in @entity2 and the @entity15 dated the scroll as having been made between 1155 and 1225			1
the scroll , which has been in possession of the @entity19 for more than 100 years , had been previously thought to be from the 17th century			1
it had been labeled ' scroll 2 '			2
this is the document that an @entity2 expert says is the oldest known complete @entity6 scroll there are many fragments of the @entity6 that are older but not complete scrolls with all five books			1
' a jew who was a librarian at the university examined the scroll in 1889 for a catalogue and wrote ' 17th century followed by a question mark , '' @entity11 said in a telephone interview			1
but in preparation for a new catalogue of the university 's @entity38 collection , @entity11 , 63 , studied the scroll and suspected that the librarian had made too cursory an examination in 1889 and not recognised its antiquity			1
the professor said he immediately recognized that it had been wrongly dated given its script and other graphic notations the meaning of the word @entity6 is @entity49 refers to the @entity6 : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , numbers and @entity54			2
the name - which derives from ' to teach ' - can also refer to the entire @entity57 bible or the whole body of @entity57 law and teachings			0
the so - called @entity61 ( the @entity62 are not part of @entity57 scripture ) is known to the @entity57 faith as the ' @entity6 ' or the ' @entity66 '			0
the scriptures are always hand - written on scrolls			0
the parchment on these scrolls are not meant to be touched by humans			0
this is because some say because they are too holy ; others say because the parchment , made from animal skins , is a source of ritual defilement ; others say because the sweat from humans has acids that will damage the parchment			0
instead , the text is followed with a pointer , called a @entity86			0
source : judiasm 101 ' i realised that the style of the writing was older than the 17th century so i consulted with other experts , ' he said of the scroll , which measures 36 metres by 64 cm ( 39 yards by 25 inches )			1
he said the scroll showed many graphical features and scribal devices that were no longer used by copyists of @entity10 scripts in the 17th century			1
the scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather each sewn together , most of them with three columns of script			1
after the experts he consulted agreed that the scroll was probably several centuries older than previously believed , @entity11 had fragments of it subjected to carbon - 14 dating tests			0
the tests , at the @entity112 in southern @entity2 and the @entity113 at the @entity114 , dated the scroll as from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century			2
the @entity6 , also known as the @entity118 , consists of the books of @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity120 and @entity54			0
the complete version of the @entity6 that was previously considered the oldest was from the late 13th century , @entity11 said			0
he said that before the scroll came into possession of the @entity12 in the 18th or 19th century it had been in the custody of the @entity127 convent in the city that is home to the world 's oldest university			2
tests dated the @entity6 ( not pictured ) as from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century @entity11 said it was not clear where the @entity6 had been copied but most likely it was not in @entity2			0
it was probably made by a copyist trained in the oriental tradition and likely done in the @entity137			0
@entity11 has for two decades been head of the @entity2 @entity140 project , which locates and catalogues fragments of @entity10 manuscripts in @entity2			2
@entity140 is the @entity10 word for the room in a synagogue where religious books or papers are stored			1
the @entity140 project has found , photographed and catalogued some 13,000 fragments of @entity57 compositions from various branches of @entity153 literature , biblical commentary , @entity57 thought , the @entity10 language and @entity57 history			1
for his work in @entity57 studies , @entity11 is due to be given an honorary degree from the @entity161 next month .			0
