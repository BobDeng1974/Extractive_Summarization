by @entity1 reporter published : 14:19 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 23 july 2012 despite being dismissed as a mostly ancient disease , the threat of leprosy still exists in the @entity5 today , and it can be dangerous if ignored			2
commonly referred to in the @entity8 , leprosy ( also known as @entity7 's disease ) has long been thought to have been eliminated – as effective treatments are available			1
however , the @entity10 has reported that there are currently about 6,500 cases of the disease in the @entity5 disease : leprosy has long been thought to have been eliminated - as effective treatments are available , but that 's not the case in places like @entity18 , where proper medical care is scarce while the disease can be spread between humans through respiratory droplets , health officials warn that some @entity5 can be at risk when in contact with armadillos			1
last year , a study on the armoured mammals found that them to be the only non-human creatures that can carry the bacteria that cause leprosy			2
armadillos are native to mostly the southern portion of the @entity5 in states like @entity34 , but can also be found in states as far east as @entity36			0
beware the armadillo : a study last year found that the mammals are the only non-human creatures that can carry the bacteria that cause leprosy the study , conducted by dr @entity43 and published in the @entity44 , linked 30 - 40 cases of leprosy in the @entity5 to armadillos			1
hardship : in the worst cases of leprosy , fingers and toes are lost and blindness can occur dr @entity43 said in a statement : ' leprosy has been feared throughout human history , and there are still regions in several countries , including in the @entity59 , where new cases of this disease continue to occur			1
’ according to the @entity63 , about 1 - 2million people worldwide have been left permanently disabled by leprosy			1
@entity7 , which mainly affects the skin , is not a killer and can easily be cured today			2
but in countries where proper medical care is scarce like @entity18 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , the disease can lead to damaged nerves if left untreated			1
contrary to popular belief , leprosy does not cause a patient 's arms and legs to fall off , but can cause hands and fingers to shrink			0
it typically starts as a light - coloured patch on the skin that can go unnoticed because it causes no pain			0
in the worst cases , fingers and toes are lost or blindness occurs			0
the bacteria that causes the disease multiplies very slowly , with an incubation period ranging anywhere from three to 20 years			0
the disease is caused by two different types of bacteria : mycobacterium leprae and mycobacterium lepromatosis .			0

currently 6,500 cases of leprosy in the @entity59
study has found that the disease can be carried by armadillos
1 - 2 million people worldwide suffer from leprosy , which is also known as @entity7 's disease
leprosy mostly affects the skin , but can lead to damaged nerves if left untreated
