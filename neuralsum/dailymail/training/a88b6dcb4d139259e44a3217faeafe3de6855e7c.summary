the female @entity1 fighter who became a poster girl for the @entity4 resistance before allegedly being beheaded by @entity6 militants is actually alive and well , it was claimed today			1
the woman , known by the pseudonym @entity10 , was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the besieged @entity14 border city after an image of her making a peace sign was retweeted over 5,000 times			1
that picture was followed days later by a gruesome photograph of an @entity21 terrorist holding the severed head of a young woman , sparking rumours that @entity10 had been savagely murdered			1
but now friends of @entity26 have told @entity27 that the dead woman in the photograph is in fact a different @entity1 resistance fighter , adding that @entity26 managed to escape @entity4 during intense fighting there last week and is now believed to be living in southern @entity33			1
' she is my friend and i confirm that she is alive			0
and the picture of beheaded female fighter is not @entity10 's picture , ' he told @entity27 , speaking on condition of anonymity			1
he went on to say that he saw @entity10 leave @entity4 during intense fighting there last week , shortly before he was forced to do the same thing			1
although he lost temporarily lost contact with @entity10 as they made their separate journeys over the nearby @entity33 border , the journalist said he has been informed by friends that she is living as a refugee in @entity33 , most likely in the southern @entity69			1
' she is in @entity33			2
i will try to gain her number because i lost the connection with her			0
she evacuated @entity4 and i stayed in @entity4			2
at the beginning of the last clashes @entity10 left @entity4 , ' he said			1
brave : thousands of @entity14 @entity1 women are battling the @entity6 in @entity14 , many of them in @entity4 @entity27 also spoke to another friend of @entity10 's who confirmed the dead woman in the sickening @entity21 photograph was not @entity10 , who she described as ' the daughter of a martyr '			1
' the facial features [ of the head in the @entity21 photo ] are not hers , ' she said , refusing to give her name			0
however the friend claimed she was not with @entity10 , had not seen her since the time the photograph emerged , and no longer had any way of contacting her			1
' i can give news on her , but i do n't want to talk until i get someone 's advice ... a person in @entity4 has refuted this news [ that she is dead ] , and i 'm going to speak to him again tomorrow , ' the friend said			1
' everyone 's asking about her , using her			0
and i do n't want to talk about her , ' she went on to say			0
the friends ' claims that @entity26 is still alive was reinforced by others who says they know @entity10 and have spoken to her in recent days			1
among those claiming to have communicated with @entity26 is the @entity14 / @entity1 journalist @entity100			1
@entity100 said rumours that she had singlehandedly killed 100 @entity21 fighters inside @entity4 were untrue , but claimed she was still ' fighting fiercely '			2
a female @entity1 fighter takes up a position during combat skills training before being deployed to fight @entity21 the suggestion @entity10 may still be alive was first raised by the @entity109 freelance journalist @entity108 , who said he had met her during a ceremony in which the @entity111 , or @entity112 , was first set up in @entity4			1
he said the dead woman in the @entity21 photograph may initially look like @entity10 , but on closer inspection her facial features and hair style and colour betrayed subtle differences			1
he also said that as @entity10 had left a law degree in @entity121 to fight join the fight in her hometown @entity4 , she had n't received the level of training required to become a full member of the @entity111 and so worked as a reservist , providing support to those on the frontline			1
such claims might it highly unlikely she would have been able to singlehandedly kill 100 @entity21 fighters , as per the rumours that spread when the photograph of her making the peace sign first emerged			1
@entity14 @entity1 gather in the @entity33 town of @entity138 for the funeral of @entity1 fighters killed by @entity21 in @entity4 the news that @entity10 is almost certainly still alive came as @entity1 resistance fighters continue to push the @entity6 back in @entity4			1
among those fighters are thousands of women , an unusual phenomenon in the @entity147 world in which warfare is often associated with manhood			0
in april , @entity1 fighters created all - female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women			2
these female fighters have played a major role in battles against @entity158 , said @entity159 , a defense official in @entity14 's @entity1 region			1
the @entity1 women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of @entity164 dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary			2
one @entity1 female fighter , who uses the @entity168 of @entity169 , used to be a teacher			2
now , the @entity1 @entity14 woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town			2
the 28 - year - old @entity1 fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw @entity21 advances in @entity14			1
' i lost many friends to this , and i decided there was a need to join up , ' said @entity169 , who declined to reveal her birth name			0
' this is our land - our own - and if we do n't do it , who else will ?

' we are just the same as men ; there 's no difference , ' she said			0
' we can do any type of job , including armed mobilization			0
' there is nothing new about @entity1 women fighters			2
they have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against @entity33 , seeking an independent @entity212 which would encompass parts of @entity33 , @entity14 , @entity214 and @entity215			2

the militants were later pushed back into the outskirts of the city , which has been held by the government after being briefly seized by rebel forces in 2012			0
