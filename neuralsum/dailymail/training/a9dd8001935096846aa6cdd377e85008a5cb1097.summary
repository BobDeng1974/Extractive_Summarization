by @entity1 reporter published : 05:11 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 05:11 est , 20 march 2012 a cancer sufferer has become the first person in the @entity4 to benefit from a robotically - constructed bladder			1
@entity6 , 61 , was diagnosed with bladder cancer last may and became the first to undergo the pioneering treatment in october			1
surgeons at @entity11 , in @entity9 , used a robot to remove mr @entity6 ' cancerous bladder through tiny incisions before replacing it with a substitute created from his own bowel tissue			1
the operating team at @entity11 with the @entity19 : it can perform far less invasive surgery the manufacturing manager , from @entity23 , near @entity24 , has now successfully recovered from the @entity4 - first operation			1
mr @entity6 said : ' immediately after the operation i was actually out of bed the following day , not for long , but i was up , and each day you did a bit more			2
' i suppose i was a little bit shocked when they said i ’d be the first but that soon disappeared and after discussions with the wife it was a very simple choice			2
' the only way i could look at the cancer was to say ‘ i am going to beat this ’ , and i am so glad i decided to go through with the operation			2
' following an operation to remove some of the cancerous tumour that was preventing his bladder from working properly , mr @entity6 was referred to a consultant at @entity11			2
nimble : the @entity19 robot is so sensitive is can peel a grape he was told he would have to have an operation but was given the option of undergoing keyhole surgery and having the neo-bladder created			1
' thinking it through , i will be honest , my initial reaction was to go for the tried and tested route , as at the time i was also told i would be the first one to have this procedure in the @entity4 , ' he said			0
' but the reason i changed my mind was because the team at @entity11 just filled you with confidence			0
' when you consider what the team did , robotically , taking away a complete bladder and other bits and pieces and then re-building it - it sounds almost science - fiction , but now i feel as though nothing has changed			2
' five small incisions were made to mr @entity6 - the largest of which was just two inches long			0
the father of two said : ' you can hardly see a scar or anything , it ’s unbelievable , but that ’s the whole idea of the robotics - it ’s far less invasive and the amount of time you need to heal up generally , to me , well , within a couple of weeks there was nothing left really			0
it was an unbelievable scenario			0
' mr @entity6 , who returned to work in january , said the advances in medical techniques were ' amazing '			0
' the strides that are being made , this is the way forward , and i was fortunate to have this service right here in @entity9 , ' he said			0
pioneering : patient @entity6 ( left ) agreed to the treatment because the urology team led by @entity98 ( right ) filled him with confidence the procedure used to be performed manually in open surgery by surgeons creating a new bladder for cancer patients who had to have the organ removed			1
but now @entity11 is making neo-bladders robotically from the patient ’s own bowel tissue inside their body which function much as a normal bladder does			1
the keyhole surgery is less invasive because the hospital ’s @entity19 robot has greater precision and the procedure as a whole has a faster recovery time for patients			1
the £ 1.5 million surgical robot - which a surgeon controls from a nearby console - is so precise it can even peel a grape			1
the procedure is being carried out by @entity11 ’s consultant urologists @entity98 and @entity124			0
mr @entity98 said : ' this is the first time in the @entity4 the whole procedure is performed through keyhole surgery using the @entity19 robot system			1
' having removed the bladder containing the tumour , we reconstruct a new bladder from the patient ’s own bowel and attach this internally to the patient ’s urethra , allowing them to pass urine normally			1
' traditionally this is a major operation with a large incision but we hope that by using this minimal access route we can decrease the trauma to the patient , enabling them to obtain a faster recovery and return to normal activity			2
' patients can be home from hospital following this type of surgery within four to seven days and in six to eight weeks they can return to a normal quality of life			0
' our abilities to carry out urological procedures robotically is expanding all the time and we are developing a real expertise in this area			0
' the robot was used in @entity11 in 2008 when it became the first hospital in the @entity162 to use a @entity19 robot to carry out prostate removal for cancer patients			1
since then the hospital has carried out more than 600 of these prostectomies			0
it is now being used for radical cystectomy and partial nephrectomy - the removal of small kidney tumours .			0

the bladder was constructed from the patient *'s* own bowel tissue
the @entity19 robot is so *dexterous* it can peel a grape
