' today it remains home to a slew of less - than - wealthy heirs to the @entity1 and @entity30 fortunes , but looks more like a rundown museum than the home of what was once one of @entity6 's richest families			1
while many assumed the @entity68 family , the 10th generation of @entity1 heirs , were eccentric hippies living off trust funds , according to @entity72 's fascinating new memoir the money had run out long ago			1
