@entity1 doctor @entity0 a controversial doctor who practises euthanasia has sparked outrage by organising a tour to @entity6 because he says the @entity8 death camp is ‘ inspiring ’			1
@entity1 doctor @entity0 , who has been dubbed ‘ dr death ’ for administering lethal injections , claims the visit will ‘ clarify confusion ’ about dying as well as addressing the issue of euthanasia			1
but @entity15 and anti-euthanasia campaigners have reacted with horror , saying the trip , billed as a study tour , is ‘ offensive and shocking ’			1
@entity20 mp sir @entity19 said : ‘ to make the notorious @entity8 concentration camp of @entity6 the centre for a congenial study - trip is preposterous , if not obscene			1
‘ whatever one ’s views on euthanasia – and i am against – it is abominable to describe @entity6 as an “ inspiring venue ”			1
what went on at @entity6 and the other death - camps was mass murder of innocents – children , women and men			1
’ dr @entity0 , who co-ordinates legalised killings from his @entity39 clinic , has circulated a brochure advertising the three - day tour for a cost of £ 470 , including visits to the @entity6 gas chambers and a ‘ seminar ’ on issues including euthanasia , which is legal in @entity1			1
he said in the leaflet that @entity6 , in @entity48 , where a million people were put to death , was ‘ the pre-eminent symbol of a degrading end of life ’			2
he added : ‘ this site is an inspiring venue for organising a seminar and reflecting on these issues so that we can consider and clarify confusions			2
’ the row coincides with controversy over attempts by the @entity20 peer and former chancellor @entity62 to legalise assisted suicide in @entity64 , which critics say could prove a ‘ slippery slope ’ towards widespread killing of the sick			0
under @entity62 ’s @entity69 , which receives its second reading in the @entity71 on friday , doctors would be able to prescribe terminally ill patients a lethal dose of drugs , but the patient would have to take the drugs themselves			0
@entity1 has gone a step further by allowing doctors to legally administer a fatal dose			2
dr @entity0 , 60 , gained notoriety after he was shown on tv ending the life of @entity84 , 44 , a transsexual who asked to die after doctors botched his sex change surgery			2
last year , he performed the world ’s first double euthanasia for deaf twin brothers @entity90 and @entity91 , 45 , after they learned that they were going blind			0
according to a leaflet advertising the tour , the visit to @entity6 will take place on october 9 , and will include a ‘ scientific programme ’ , details of which are not yet finalised			2
it says they will be accompanied by documentary maker @entity102 , who was imprisoned in a @entity105 camp during the @entity106 , and participate in a ‘ symposium ’			0
however , a spokesman for @entity6 said the group was only booked in for a routine tour led by official guides who will relate the history of the camp and show them the key areas including the gas chambers			1
@entity0 , who has been dubbed ' dr death ' for administering lethal injections , claims the visit to @entity6 ( above ) will ' clarify confusion ' about dying as well as addressing the issue of euthanasia the group will also visit @entity6 to see where @entity15 were herded off the transportation trains and selected to go straight to the gas chamber or to become prisoners			1
@entity127 peer @entity125 , the son of @entity48 @entity15 immigrants , said : ‘ this is shocking			0
it will cause offence to a lot of people throughout @entity134 , whichever side of the argument they are on			0
i am all in favour of people going to @entity6 to find out the oppression that happened there , but to describe it as an inspiring setting suggests he is either mad , stupid or incompetent			2
’ anti-euthanasia campaigner @entity143 , the @entity64 paralympian , said : ‘ to describe @entity6 as “ inspiring ” is very upsetting and very disturbing			1
’ dr @entity0 was unavailable for comment yesterday , but he earlier told the @entity146 he had been shocked by criticisms			2
he was quoted as saying : ‘ firstly , this is not a symposium about euthanasia			0
it ’s a study trip focusing on human rights , suffering and palliative care			0
we will mention euthanasia , but that is not the main goal of the trip			0
‘ the participants are all professionals working in palliative care			0
they work every day with patients who suffer pain and death			0
‘ our main goal is to visit the death camp where all these atrocities took place			1
‘ secondly , many of the participants were not in favour of a law on euthanasia , but changed their mind after the law came into action			0
‘ there is obviously no link between euthanasia in @entity1 and what happened in @entity6			1
‘ the @entity179 used the term “ euthanasia ” wrongly			0

@entity1 doctor @entity0 has organised a ' study tour ' to @entity6
he claims the @entity8 death camp is ' inspiring ' and will help ' clarify confusion '
*jewish* and anti-euthanasia campaigners said it is ' offensive and shocking '
