@entity1 striker @entity0 was fortunate not to be sent off for stamping on @entity2 's @entity3 , according to former @entity5 referee and @entity7 columnist @entity6			1
the @entity9 man was attempting to grab the ball for a throw - in during his side 's @entity14 semi-final second leg when he came down hard on the lower part of @entity18 's right leg			2
the 21 - year - old @entity19 was left writhing on the turf in pain but referee @entity22 allowed play to go on as normal after the incident , with @entity0 avoiding a card			2
@entity6 said : ' @entity0 should have been dismissed early on against @entity2 for a blatant stamp on @entity3 and that would have cost @entity1 dear			1
' they would have missed him for the rest of this game and then the massive @entity5 clash against @entity51 this saturday			0
' the question now is will the @entity53 act retrospectively and charge @entity0 with violent conduct ? to do so they have to check that referee @entity22 did not see the incident ; it might seem obvious that he did n't as he took no disciplinary action but once @entity22 confirms that neither he nor his colleagues saw the stamp they should charge @entity0			2
@entity0 and can clash after the incident , which occurred close to @entity1 boss @entity63 @entity19 midfielder can has to be held back from @entity0 by his @entity2 team - mate @entity65 @entity66 ( left ) and @entity67 both agreed that @entity0 should 've been shown a red card @entity70 's stamp @entity0 is confronted by @entity3 in the 12th minute after stamping on the @entity2 star 's ankle			1
@entity39 's verdict : @entity0 should have been dismissed for the stamp			2
the question is will the @entity53 charge @entity0 with violent conduct ? to do so they have to check ref @entity22 did n't see it			0
penalty kick ? @entity65 appears to bring down @entity0 in the area in the 23rd minute but @entity22 gives a goal - kick			1
@entity81 pundit @entity66 said at half - time : ' @entity65 does n't need to commit , the referee had a clear view and did n't give a penalty			1
' @entity39 's verdict : @entity63 can have a justifiable moan about the ' campaign ' against @entity1 after @entity0 is clearly fouled by @entity65			1
@entity22 has a clear view but awards a goal - kick when it should have been a penalty			1
@entity92 outraged by @entity22 's decision not to award @entity0 a penalty , @entity63 confronted the referee in the tunnel at half - time and had to be shepherded away by fourth official @entity98			1
@entity39 's verdict : if they did their jobs , the officials would report @entity63			0
managers are not allowed to do this			0
@entity103 @entity0 and @entity65 tangle again in the 54th minute			1
this time the @entity1 striker stamps on the defender 's foot when the pair chase a loose ball and @entity65 retaliates by swinging his foot at @entity110			1
@entity39 's verdict : i 'd give @entity0 the benefit of the doubt as he was airborne and had to land somewhere			2
but both players should have been cautioned as they went head to head			0
head to head @entity0 tussles with @entity119 in the 12th minute of extra-time and puts his hand over the @entity2 captain 's face			1
the pair go head to head and are both booked			0
@entity39 's verdict : having decided not to caution @entity0 and @entity65 , he gave yellow cards to @entity0 and @entity119 when they repeated the head - to - head act			1
' that should be done by 6pm on wednesday meaning that a ban could be imposed in time to take effect for saturday			0
whether @entity1 would appeal would depend on whether that could cause enough delay to make @entity0 available for saturday 's key fixture			2
' there can be no blame attached to @entity22 for missing the @entity0 incident as replays showed his view , from a good position , was blocked by @entity141			2
in fact @entity22 's positioning was good throughout the first half when he correctly waved @entity1 's very early penalty appeals away when the ball struck @entity147 on the arm			2
' @entity63 's men welcome champions @entity51 to @entity33 this saturday , with the game likely to have a huge impact on the title race			2
@entity1 currently sit top of the @entity5 , five points clear of @entity156 's side			0
@entity81 pundits @entity67 and @entity66 both agreed with @entity39 at half - time , insisting that Â£ 32million man @entity0 should have seen red			1
@entity7 columnist @entity67 said : ' it 's a blatant red card , bang out of order and takes a liberty			2
he stamps and it 's a certain red card , but the ref ca n't see it			0
the implications would have been huge because he would have missed the game on saturday [ against @entity51 ]			0
@entity66 added : ' it is a red card			0
he knows what he is doing			0
we all love his passion but he did n't have to go all the way and step on the guy			0
' @entity39 had more sympathy for @entity0 later in the first half when he went down inside @entity2 's box after a clumsy challenge from @entity65			1
@entity22 , who booked @entity0 for diving against @entity179 earlier this season , waved away the @entity183 international 's appeals for a penalty but did not show him a yellow card			2
@entity6 said : ' i struggle to understand @entity188 ' decision to award @entity2 a goal - kick in the 22nd minute after @entity65 tripped @entity0			1
' @entity22 had gone wide to get a good view and by awarding a goal - kick he indicated that @entity65 had not played the ball			1
so , for @entity22 surely either @entity0 dived or it was a penalty			0
' @entity22 , of course cautioned @entity0 in the opening game of the season when he wrongly thought he had dived at @entity179			0
this time he did n't go that far but should have given @entity1 the penalty they deserved for @entity65 's unnecessary challenge which caught @entity0			1
' former @entity199 striker @entity66 was in agreement , despite some reservations when seeing the incident live			2
@entity0 attempts to move past @entity65 and towards @entity2 's goal during a @entity1 attack @entity65 appears to make contact with @entity0 's right leg as the ball gets away from the in - form forward @entity1 striker @entity0 is sent tumbling to the ground but was not awarded a penalty or booked for diving ' i thought it was n't a penalty at first but the more i see it the more i think that it is , ' he said			1
' i do n't know why @entity65 needs to commit			0
' @entity6 added : ' @entity63 looked furious and no doubt feels this added to his feeling that match officials are against him and @entity1			2
' if they did their jobs they would report him for his approach to the them in the tunnel before the start of the second half			0
' managers are not permitted to do this as @entity63 knows , as does fourth official @entity98 who was seen alerting @entity63 that his actions were on camera			0
' @entity1 boss @entity63 reacts angrily after @entity0 is denied a penalty during the first half the @entity236 believes there has been a campaign against his side when it comes to penalties this season @entity63 talks to referee @entity22 in the tunnel at half - time after being angered by his decisions @entity0 was at the centre of more controversy in the second half when he again caught a @entity2 player with his studs			1
the @entity1 man was running towards goal when his left boot caught that of @entity65 , an incident which resulted in the pair going face - to - face with each other in an angry exchange			1
@entity6 said : ' @entity0 was involved in another clash and potential stamp early in the second half as he trod on @entity65 after the @entity2 defender had tackled him fairly			1
' i 'd give @entity0 the benefit of the doubt on this one as he was airbourne and had to land somewhere			0
referees can not guess , nor look at a player 's reputation , hence the benefit of doubt going @entity0 's way			0
' both players should though have been cautioned as they went head - to - head after the incident			0
we used to call that ' adopting an aggressive attitude ' and would always book both players			0
now that 's clearly not the case			0
' @entity0 lands on @entity65 's left foot as he runs after the ball during the second period at @entity33 the @entity1 man makes contact with his studs but @entity6 believes he deserves the benefit of the doubt @entity0 was involved in one final scuffle when he clashed with @entity119 in the 12th minute of extra-time			1
