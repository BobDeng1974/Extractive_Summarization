one of the biggest fixtures on the @entity2 footballing calendar takes place this weekend , although some of the usual gloss has been taken off a game recently baptised @entity7			0
@entity8 and @entity9 have shared the last five @entity11 titles between them and @entity9 are set to continue their domestic domination this term			1
this time , however , the two giant antagonists of the @entity2 game meet with 31 points and nine positions separating them in the standings , but that does not mean the stakes are not as high as they always are when these two clubs meet			1
@entity23 ( centre ) celebrates with his @entity8 players after their victory against @entity27 @entity8 are now only five points from the top six having climbed their way from the foot of the table at the midway stage of the season to 10th , although their coach @entity23 insists their league position after the @entity7 is not his biggest concern			1
' we 've got to try to beat @entity9 and where that can take us in the league is secondary , ' @entity23 said			2
' although we 're 10th , and although there 's a huge points gap between us , and although a lot is different compared to the past , it 's still a @entity8 home game			1
' i do n't recall us gifting any of these games in the past			0
@entity8 's @entity48 ( right ) challenges @entity27 centre back @entity50 ' @entity51 have shown us how it 's done			2
@entity52 have also beaten them , but it 's not all that easy			0
' @entity54 would nevertheless be important for @entity8 if they are to close the gap on the top six and qualify for @entity57 next season , while a second consecutive defeat for @entity9 is almost unheard of and it would allow @entity52 to reduce the deficit at the top to seven points			1
the @entity65 host bottom - placed @entity63 on saturday while third - placed @entity51 can strengthen their grip on a place in the @entity68 with a win at @entity70			2
the battle at the bottom of the table is intensifying with all of the bottom eight sides separated by just seven points and still in danger			0
@entity76 cuts a cool figure during @entity9 's training session on thursday @entity79 reacted to their slide into the bottom three by appointing @entity82 as their new coach during the international break and his first game is a daunting trip to fourth - placed @entity88			1
the northern @entity90 side therefore risk coming out the other side of the weekend inside the bottom two with @entity92 travelling to @entity93 on sunday			0
@entity94 and @entity95 are also involved in that scrap and they meet on saturday with @entity97 travelling to @entity98			0
elsewhere , @entity100 host @entity99 on sunday and @entity101 welcome @entity27 and their under - fire coach @entity102 to the @entity103 .			0

@entity8 and @entity9 have shared the last five @entity11 titles between them
@entity9 currently have a 10 - point lead at the summit of the table
@entity8 are 31 points behind their *rivals* in 10th place
