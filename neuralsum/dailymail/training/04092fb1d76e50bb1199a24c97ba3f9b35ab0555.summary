@entity0 was sat having a few beers in a bar in @entity3 as he watched @entity4 beaten by @entity5 in the @entity7 third round four years ago – and he was n’t best pleased			1
the current caretaker boss is a lifelong @entity4 fan and was just five years old when they last won a trophy – the @entity11 – in 1969			1
@entity0 takes his @entity4 side to @entity15 on saturday afternoon and , while the club hierarchy have previously played down the importance of the cup competitions , @entity13 ’s former assistant says he will be naming his strongest xi to win the game			1
@entity4 caretaker boss @entity0 hopes the club can end their wait for a major trophy the lifelong @entity24 takes charge of @entity4 again as they take on @entity15 in the @entity7 on saturday ‘ four years ago , i was in @entity3 watching the game against @entity5 and let me tell you , i was really disappointed - and i had a few beers as well , ’ he said			1
‘ listen , there has been an awful lot made about cup runs so let me say this : every game i go into i want to win , so i will put the best team on the pitch that i possibly can to win the game			2
‘ i know exactly how much it means to the fans to have a cup run because i am one of them			2
‘ i have been to an @entity7 final and a semi-final and i will never forget that reception			1
although we lost to @entity46 in 1999 , when we came out of the tunnel at @entity48 , with our fans were behind us , it was quite emotional			2
‘ so i know exactly what it means			2
i have actually been in the stands when we lost to @entity53 in the final in 1998 , so i know what it is like and how important it is			0
so to get back there is one of the most important things in my eyes			0
’ @entity4 will be without central defender @entity61 for the rest of the season after injury against @entity65 @entity13 ( centre back ) has left @entity66 to take charge at struggling @entity68 @entity0 is bidding to win the @entity4 job on a permanent basis but was disappointed with the 3 - 3 draw at home to @entity65 on @entity76 , a match in which they surrendered the lead three times			1
he does not , however , believe that saturday 's game takes on any added importance given their failure to beat the second - from - bottom @entity65			0
‘ there ’s no extra significance , ’ said @entity0 , who has lost defender @entity61 for the remainder of the season with an @entity86 injury			1
‘ i know how important it is to win a @entity91 game and how important it is to win an @entity7 match too , so i have not thought of it any differently if we had won , drew or lost against @entity65			1
‘ i need to see what we have available and i will pick my strongest available side			0
but if i have three or four players who are carrying things , then that is obviously an issue			0
the team might pick itself			0
‘ we have already lost @entity103 to the @entity104 and we are going to lose @entity105 and @entity106 soon			0
so that 's three players we have lost and with the injury list we have got , we have to deal with it			0

*newcastle* are away at @entity15 in the @entity7 third round
@entity4 supporter @entity0 will treat the competition seriously
the @entity116 have *n't* won a trophy since 1969
