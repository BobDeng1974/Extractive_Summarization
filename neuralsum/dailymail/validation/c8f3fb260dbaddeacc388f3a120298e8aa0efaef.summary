@entity1 boss @entity0 believes dressing - room spats between players are ' a natural occurrence ' at the highest level			1
@entity6 visit @entity7 on saturday at the end of a week where the club have been forced to play down reports that captain @entity11 was dropped following a bust - up with team - mate @entity13			1
the row allegedly came at half - time during their defeat by @entity18 earlier this month , with neither player in the starting line - up for the clash with @entity22 three days later			1
@entity11 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) were involved in a dressing - room row at @entity18 but @entity0 dismissed suggestions it was a good time to face @entity6 and can understand why passions occasionally run too high			1
he said : ' i think it 's a natural occurrence			2
you 've got highly - talented , highly - motivated people , all in a working environment that 's very challenging			1
' everyone wants a shirt , everyone wants to play , and also , i can only imagine , at that level you 're borderline into 25 mini companies			2
it 's not just players , you 're dealing with the whole shebang - @entity40 consultants , agents , @entity41 , who knows what else			1
' i imagine it 's like having 25 ceos and trying to align them all with whatever the bigger picture is			0
there 's always going to be challenges because they 're powerful - minded people , which is why they 're at the top of the game			1
' @entity11 was dropped to the bench when @entity6 hosted @entity22 @entity1 are without a win in two months and sit second bottom of the @entity57 table , three points from safety			1
but @entity6 and manager @entity60 will certainly not underestimate the @entity1 after their stunning performance at the @entity62 in december , when they fought back from 2 - 0 down to claim a draw			1
@entity0 said : ' they 've got some fantastic players			0
we experienced that once before , we gave a good performance and i think overall deserved a point out of the game			0
but that does n't guarantee us anything this time around			1
' they 're a highly - motivated group of players , still in the hunt , still right up there , very experienced and a fantastic manager , so obviously it 's a big challenge once again			2
' @entity11 attempts to tackle @entity80 during @entity6 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity18 @entity0 added to his squad this week with the recruitment on a three - year deal of @entity86 midfielder @entity85			1
the @entity1 boss has been keen for the club to expand their scouting network into @entity90 and signed 22 - year - old @entity85 after a two - week trial			2
the @entity1 were already short in midfield before @entity93 was ruled out for the season with a knee injury last month but @entity0 insisted @entity85 will not be rushed			0
' he wanted to come in and i think it 's a good way of doing business because he gets a chance to have a look at us and we can have a look at him , and he fitted in straight away , ' said the @entity1 boss			0
' that was probably the key thing			0
sometimes players who are with you and are not part of the group , they look not part of the group , but he fitted in seamlessly and we thought there was more to come from him , so that 's why we signed him			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 can understand why passions occasionally run too high ' at the moment it 's that cooling - off period , getting used to how we work			2
i do n't know that much about the @entity86 league but i know it 's not the @entity57			0
' he 's been to a couple of games so he knows how we operate and how the @entity57 operates			0
we 're looking forward to him working with us and developing further			0
' we have been light in midfield but that 's not why @entity132 's come in , because if it was he 'd have to operate immediately			0
we think there 's more to come going forwards than right now			0
' if he 's needed this season and we think he 's ready , then that 's different , but he 's only been in the building a couple of weeks , so we 'll see how he continues getting used to what it is to be here and obviously then looking at the idea of being in the first team , but there 's no rushing that situation			2
