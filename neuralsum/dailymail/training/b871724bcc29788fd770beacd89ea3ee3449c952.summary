with his maniacal grin and a hoard of body guards following his every move through an underwater cavern , @entity0 appears to have found a lair worthy of a @entity8 villain			1
but the @entity10 leader has n't stumbled on to the set of @entity12 , and is actually touring a renovated children 's camp			1
the rather plush looking ' international ' children 's camp boasts its own aquarium , a swimming pool and football pitch - with places at the camp offered as a reward to the country 's highest achieving students			1
and the 27 - year - old looked delighted with the results as he walked around the complex - despite the aquarium appearing to be lacking any fish			0
the camp is open during the summer for @entity10 children who achieve particularly good school grades but also for foreign students for two to three weeks each july			2
it is unclear exactly how many international students it might attract			0
@entity0 's visit comes after photos were released yesterday of him meeting a group of adoring female military personnel known as ‘ airpersons ’			1
the women swarmed around him to grab on to their ‘ @entity59 ’ in the first meeting of the female flying personnel of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) during a photo session in the capital @entity65			0
plush complex : the camp also boasts a newly built athletic field complete with viewing stands reward : the @entity73 international children 's camp , which also has a new swimming pool , is open to @entity10 children who achieve good grades at the event in the notoriously secretive country , @entity0 also sat for formal pictures with his generals and paraded past the assembled military			1
the cheerful nature of the @entity10 leader is in stark contrast to the latest dark speculation surrounding his leadership , as a national @entity87 newspaper has alleged he may have executed his aunt			0
@entity89 , 67 , is the widow of recently - executed @entity90 , the uncle that @entity0 who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed last december			2
ms @entity89 has mysteriously disappeared from a re-run of a tv propaganda film , leading to speculation that she has been purged from her exhalted position , or even executed			0
scenes from the documentary show @entity0 ’s aunt in one scene , but she was cut out when the programme was aired again			2
miss @entity101 was last seen ‘ in the flesh ’ at a public concert in september last year - and while her name was among top officials at a committee organising the state funeral of a senior workers ’ party official , she did not make an appearance			0
very happy : @entity0 appeared delighted with the results as he toured the camp after its renovation pretty in pink : the @entity10 leader inspects on the dorm rooms in the complex			1

the @entity73 international children 's camp opened in the 1960s
