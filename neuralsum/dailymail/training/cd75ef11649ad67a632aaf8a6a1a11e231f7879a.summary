unimpressed : the @entity0 , senior chaplain at @entity1 , said spirituality seemed to be taking a back seat in the new format broadcasting services from parishes and cathedrals across the country , for more than 50 years @entity9 has been much loved as the @entity11 ’s flagship religious programme			1
but after a relaunch as a magazine - style programme earlier this month in a move to attract a wider audience , loyal viewers have been left feeling it is becoming little more than ‘ the one show with added hymns ’			1
and even the clergy has hit out at the new format , with the reverend @entity22 leading calls to bring ‘ actual worship ’ back into the programme , claiming it no longer felt ‘ authentic ’ and that spirituality seemed to be taking a backseat			1
@entity29 , senior chaplain at @entity1 in @entity30 , tweeted : ‘ thinking of starting a campaign to get # @entity33 to bring back actual worship eg bible reading & prayers ... @entity36 would agree with me ! ’ she was referring to actress dame @entity38 , a committed @entity39 who presented @entity9 spin - off @entity41 ! this followed her appearance on @entity44 , on which she echoed the concerns of many viewers who remain unimpressed with the new style of the weekly programme			1
she was one of three clergy to appear on the show , alongside @entity51 , an @entity52 and @entity53 , and @entity54 , a @entity55 , who agreed spirituality seemed to take a backseat in the new format			1
after watching the first new - style episode , @entity29 said : ‘ i think there is a question as to whether or not this is inspiring us to worship or whether it ’s just a whole load of nice people doing something in their community - and @entity9 should be about worship			1
‘ i did enjoy it , i think it did n’t feel authentic enough for me though , they need to go further , risk more , to have genuine @entity39 faith represented because it ’s a lifeline for many older people			0
’ @entity9 : the programme ( above , in 2005 ) , which has been running for more than 50 years , was relaunched this month as a magazine - style show in a move to attract a wider , @entity78 audience these sentiments were echoed by @entity80 , who said : ‘ in terms of representation of denomination , expression of type of worship , this has done a great job			1
but in terms of spirituality you might reconsider that			0
’ the relaunch took place earlier this month and saw the traditional format of a single @entity52 service being recorded dropped in favour of each show featuring a world of locations and denominations , as well as news segments on faith around the world – for example , the first episode included a report on the persecution of @entity109 in @entity110			2
@entity111 , the @entity11 ’s head of religion , has previously explained the move is designed to widen the show ’s audience			2
he said the average @entity9 viewer is in their mid- 70s - with viewers in their 50s , who would usually ‘ replenish ’ the older audience , lacking the religious ‘ interest and knowledge ’ that would attract them to @entity9			2
discussion : @entity29 ( centre ) was one of three clergy on @entity44 , with @entity51 ( left ) , an @entity52 and @entity53 , and @entity54 ( right ) , a @entity55 he said this was in contrast to the congregations at @entity132 and @entity55 churches which are growing due to immigration - and therefore offered a new audience			1
however , many of the show ’s long - term viewers have been left unhappy by the shift			2
viewer @entity138 said that while he liked the inclusion of religious current affairs in the new format , ‘ i ’m also a bit worried it will turn into the one show with added hymns ’			2
one contacted @entity44 and said : ‘ you have spoilt our sundays			0
good job our parents were n’t here to see what you have done to @entity9 ’ , while another added : ‘ does the @entity11 not realise that for a lot of people this is the only religious experience they can enjoy ? ’ in response to the concerns , mr @entity111 told @entity44 : ‘ @entity9 has been going for 54 years and in those 54 years it ’s evolved many , many times			0
at the helm : @entity9 presenters @entity160 ( left ) , @entity161 ( centre ) and @entity163 ‘ this is just one of many evolutions we ’ve seen in the show			0
traditional @entity52 worship will still be part of it as it always has been			0
so in that sense i would reassure all our viewers and say give it a chance			0
‘ with the changes in how @entity39 is evolving in this country , with the various different denominations , people coming from abroad , the growth in evangelical christianity , @entity39 , etc , all these things , we felt it was really relevant to get as much of that in one episode each week as possible and make it more accessible to more people on a weekly basis ’			0
some viewers also jumped in to defend the change , with one telling @entity44 : ‘ when i heard there were going to be changes i was a little bit concerned because i do so enjoy it but it was wonderful ’ , and another adding that it was now ‘ a better representation of modern @entity39 , the different styles of worship and praise ’ .			0

relaunched as magazine - style show for wider , @entity78 audience
but change to 50 - year - old show has left loyal viewers and clergy *aghast*
