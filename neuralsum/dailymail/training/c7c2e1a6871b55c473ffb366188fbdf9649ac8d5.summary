by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 04:41 est , 18 september 2013 @entity1 was drawn into a row over offensive football chants yesterday as he defended @entity5 fans who shout the word ‘ @entity7 ’			1
the prime minister revealed that he thought supporters of the @entity11 club should not face prosecution for chanting the terms ‘ @entity14 ’ and ‘ yid army ’ at games because they are jokingly referring to themselves and therefore not ‘ motivated by hate ’			1
but he said other people should be discouraged from using the term , because of the offence it could cause			0
his view directly contradicts the official stance of the @entity24 , which has issued a statement warning @entity5 fans that using the words could result in a banning order or even lead to criminal charges			1
his say : @entity1 believes fans who used the word should not be prosecuted , unless it is used in hatred support : @entity5 fans will face no action for chanting the word ' @entity7 ' last weekend for years , @entity5 supporters have been on the receiving end of anti-semitic abuse from opposition fans – as the club has long had a @entity44 following			1
in an act of defiance , some started using the word ‘ @entity7 ’ themselves and chants of ‘ @entity7 ’ , ‘ yid army ’ and ‘ @entity14 ’ are regularly heard coming from the home stands at @entity52			2
mr @entity1 told @entity53 that it was wrong for people to use the word in a derogatory sense			0
@entity7 is probably short for @entity58 , the @entity59 - influenced language spoken since medieval times by people from the @entity44 diaspora in central and eastern @entity63			1
the word derives from @entity59 word @entity66 , meaning @entity44 , which is pronounced with an initial @entity69 sound			2
it was first recorded in @entity71 in 1874 , when it was included in a dictionary of @entity11 slang			0
since the @entity75 the word has been used by @entity44 authors , often to portray antisemitic speech			2
some @entity44 groups say the term is offensive all of the time			2
but he added : ‘ there ’s a difference between @entity5 fans self - describing themselves as @entity7 and someone calling someone a @entity7 as an insult			1
‘ you have to be motivated by hate			0
hate speech should be prosecuted – but only when it ’s motivated by hate			0
’ however the @entity24 said the word was ‘ derogatory and offensive ’ and urged fans to refrain from using it on the terraces			1
in a statement last week the @entity24 announced : ‘ the use of the term “ @entity7 ” is likely to be considered offensive by the reasonable observer – and it considers the term to be inappropriate in a football setting			1
‘ the @entity24 would encourage fans to avoid using it in any situation			2
’ the statement finishes with a warning , which says : ‘ use of the term in a public setting could amount to a criminal offence , and leave those fans liable to prosecution and potentially a lengthy football banning order			2
’ the club has responded to the @entity24 by announcing that they plan to send a questionnaire to all season ticket holders asking if they think the practice should stop			0
debut : fans chanted ' @entity120 ' at @entity121 ( left ) , in action against @entity123 but fans reacted defiantly to the statement , chanting ‘ @entity7 army ’ and ‘ we ’ll sing what we want ’ throughout their 2 - 0 win over @entity127			2
and @entity130 , a board member for @entity131 , insisted that @entity5 fans have reclaimed the word , making it no longer offensive			1
last night a @entity136 spokesman said : ‘ we would discourage anyone from using the term “ @entity7 ” given the historical associations of the term and the offence that it could cause			0
‘ the pm was asked about criminal prosecution and specifically whether people who refer to themselves in this way should be prosecuted			0
self - referring is clearly different to people using it as a term of abuse motivated by hatred			0
’ however the @entity151 said it backs the @entity24 ’s stance on the use of the word ‘ @entity7 ’ – as many see any use of the word as an anti-semitic form of abuse			1
and @entity44 @entity160 fan @entity159 , a former adviser to mr @entity1 , said he disagreed with the prime minister ’s stance			1
he told @entity163 ’s @entity142 programme : ‘ this is an insulting word and when i take my children to a game with @entity5 it is so disturbing to have @entity160 fans react to this chant with racist insults			1
‘ i do n’t think @entity5 @entity44 have control of the term in the way they think they do			1
in addition it makes me very uncomfortable to see so many non-jews use this phrase			0
’ watch your language : @entity5 fans have been given a strong caution by the @entity24 not to chant the word @entity7 hitting back : comedian @entity183 , pictured with his wife @entity184 , said only a small minority of @entity5 fans are @entity44 @entity44 comedian @entity183 has spoken out against the chants , insisting that using the word ‘ @entity7 ’ is unacceptable – and that only a minority of @entity5 fans are actually @entity44			1
mr @entity183 said @entity5 fans ’ argument that they are ‘ reclaiming ’ the term is illogical as the club ’s @entity44 association has long been considered outdated			1
he claimed that fewer than five per cent of those in the ground at home games are now @entity44			0
‘ there are only 250,000 @entity44 in @entity198 as a whole and i ’d say that about three or four per cent of @entity5 ’s crowd is @entity44 , ’ he said			2
‘ that means that well over 90 per cent of those chanting “ @entity207 ” are not actually @entity44 – and that is just one of several reasons why it can not be right			0
’ he added : ‘ at @entity5 , the club ’s “ jewishness ” is just a historical association with the area			0
‘ it ’s doubtful that there are more than five per cent actual @entity44 in the ground at home games			0
‘ so the argument “ but it is just like @entity217 using the @entity218 ” does not apply to most of the @entity5 fans			1
’ mr @entity183 , a @entity160 supporter , who made a film about the issue last year for campaign group @entity222 , said @entity5 fans ’ use of the term encouraged other teams ’ supporters to use it in a more derogatory sense			1
‘ it ’s a call and response dynamic , like many at football matches , ’ he wrote on the @entity229 website			0
‘ so the more @entity5 do it , the more it comes back , with menaces			0
many @entity160 fans who i have challenged feel they are justified because “ the @entity7 is what @entity5 call themselves ”			1
’ he added : ‘ the thing to remember about @entity7 is it ’s a race - hate word			2
it was daubed across the @entity242 by @entity244 ’s @entity243 , along with the word “ out ”			0
‘ the only possible reason why a culture that has tried to dismiss other race - hate words to the margins of language would consider it acceptable is if the racism of which it is a part is somehow less offensive , somehow less significant , than other racisms			0
‘ which must be , i guess , what a lot of people consciously or unconsciously think – if it had been the n - word or the p - word , it would n’t have got past @entity1 ’s lips			0
