by @entity0 and @entity1 the companions she grew up with included a lion , a chimp and a polar bear			2
june @entity7 had a doll and a cuddly teddy , of course , but you 'd be more likely to find her snuggling up to a penguin			1
nor would it have been unusual to spot her posing for photographs with her head in a pelican 's bill , or maybe sitting on an elephant 's knee			0
and while other children might have been content to play hop - scotch or skipping games , june preferred dancing with goats			1
unlikely friendship : as a young girl , june @entity7 counted lions , chimpanzees and polar bears among her best friends			1
above , the youngster plays with two lion cubs play time : these amazing images show the unlikely friendships she formed growing up at @entity38 's biggest zoo			1

but june grew up with them all as her father founded and built up what is now the @entity38 's biggest zoo			1
and — at the age of 87 — june has thrown open a treasured album of black - and - white photos to reveal her delightful relationship with her family of animal friends			1
her story is part of a @entity73 drama , @entity74 , charting the founding of @entity45 by its eccentric owner @entity42 , june 's father			1
yesterday in advance of the launch of the mini-series , june recalled : ' it was very exciting growing up surrounded by all these animals and it was an amazing feeling having them as friends — i never thought my childhood was unusual			1
' i would always try to help out by working in the shop , locking up gates and then , on days when staff were off , i 'd help out a bit more with the animals			0
i loved every minute of it			0
' looking cheery : in 1930 , the @entity42 family owned only one gibbon and two goats - but more than 80 years on , the zoo now boasts an enormous collection of animals food time : the black - and - white photos show ms @entity7 playing with lions , feeding pelicans ( pictured ) , reading to monkeys and dancing with goats during her childhood mucking in : she can even be seen poking her fingers through a cage to feed a @entity109 black bear ( right ) and bending down to feed penguins , @entity111 and @entity112 ( left ) ex-serviceman @entity42 paid £ 3,500 for a small area of land around @entity115 in @entity44 in 1930 and moved into the house with his wife @entity117 , daughter june , then aged four , and her sister @entity119			1
the only animals the family had were two goats , later joined by a gibbon			2
the first animals acquired specifically for the zoo were two bears from a wildlife park in @entity128 , @entity129			0
@entity130 worried that the animals would escape , but mr @entity42 continued to stock it with exotic and sometimes dangerous beasts , including lions			2
furry helper : ms @entity7 's father , @entity42 , is pictured with a chimpanzee called @entity138 , which helped him build a lion enclosure when the zoo was first set up getting to work : ms @entity7 said it was ' an amazing feeling ' counting animals among her friends			1
@entity146 , mr @entity42 and @entity138 the chimp work on the enclosure relatives : ' it was very exciting growing up as a young girl surrounded by these animals , ' said the pensioner			1
left , mr @entity42 and , right , ms @entity7 's sister , @entity119 yet june 's fondest memory is of her bond with a lion cub , @entity158 , which she hand - reared after its mother died giving birth to another cub			1
her greatest disappointment was to learn that her father swapped @entity158 for a polar bear and had the lion shipped to @entity166 without telling her			2
june married and moved to @entity167 in 1954 , but returned later to work at the zoo			2
now a widow , she lives a stone 's throw from the grounds of the zoo , which boats 11,000 animals from 400 species			0

' i was only four and a half when my father bought the zoo , ' she said			2
' there was a bad reaction to it at first because people were frightened of the noise and whether the wild animals might get out			0
' in those days , @entity210 had lots of large houses and businessmen living there and they did n't want something like this coming in and taking over			0
motherly duties : during her time at the zoo , ms @entity7 hand reared her own lion cub , @entity158 , after its mother died giving birth			1
@entity223 , june , 19 , is pictured with @entity158 growing up together : ms @entity7 , whose husband , @entity196 , died in 2012 , said she was n't aware her childhood was unusual at the time			1
above , she is pictured with @entity138 dancing through life : the pensioner spent her childhood and early twenties helping at the zoo , before leaving to work in @entity167 and @entity232 during the 1950s ' i never thought my childhood was unusual as it 's just your parents and your home - you grow up all the same and do n't know any different			2

she even hand reared her own lion cub , @entity158 , after its mother died giving birth to another cub - but the pair were later torn apart when her father sold the lion to a @entity166 buyer in return for a polar bear			2

it was incredibly disappointing to lose @entity158 , but such is life			0
' my husband and i moved away in 1954 to live in @entity167 and @entity232 just so we could see a bit of the world			0
we did quite a few jobs out there but the highlight for me was working as a waitress on the @entity283			0
' my husband mainly worked as a handyman and because we had a caravan we could travel around the country and see some of the sights			0
' after travelling to the other side of the world , ms @entity7 and her husband returned to work at the zoo , where there had been several new additions			1
still smiling : since 2012 , ms @entity7 ( pictured in front of a portrait of her father ) has lived alone in @entity298 , just a stone 's throw away from the zoo 's grounds ' we were out in @entity167 and @entity232 for about three years and when we returned to the @entity38 there were a fair few noticeable changes at the zoo , ' she said			1
' i went back to working in the aquarium and @entity196 helped out with a lot of the planning for building work as the zoo really started to expand			0
' i do n't remember when exactly it was but myself and @entity196 moved to @entity313 on @entity314 after we retired and by that point the zoo had grown ever so much			0
' at the beginning we only had a few animals but by then there were at least two or three of every animal and the amount of land we had was incredible			0
' it was a very interesting childhood and i loved every minute of it			0
i have got some incredible memories			0
' since her husband 's death in 2012 , ms @entity7 has lived alone in @entity298 , situated just a stone 's throw away from the zoo 's grounds			1

' i think the new tv show will be very exciting and i hope people can enjoy seeing how the zoo became what it is today			2
