by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 25 may 2013 anxiety : former @entity4 star @entity3 suffers from panic attacks for someone with a history of anxiety , a career in reality television might seem inadvisable			1
but for @entity4 star @entity3 , appearing in the bafta - winning series helped him finally confront his mental health problems			1
after watching his reality - show colleagues talking about his split from girlfriend and co-star @entity17 , @entity3 suffered the latest in a string of full - blown panic attacks – and knew he had to seek help			1
‘ in one episode of the last series the cast had all gone to @entity25 without me and @entity17 was saying rude things about me and our break - up , ’ recalls the 25 - year - old			1
‘ suddenly , i could n’t breathe			2
i must have blacked out because the next thing i knew , i was slumped on the sofa and the show was over			1
’ chronic anxiety – a psychological condition that often causes panic attacks – affects one in six adults			1
@entity3 has had the problem since childhood , but when his episodes increased in number and severity , he sought a diagnosis			1
‘ being on tv brought out all my insecurities and paranoia , ’ he explains			2
‘ a panic attack always starts with feeling like someone is trying to belittle me			1
’ other recent attacks have been brought on after reading derogatory comments about himself on social media sites such as @entity52			2
‘ i feel trapped and crushed and small – it ’s like a tiny tennis ball is in the middle of my chest and getting bigger and bigger , ’ he reveals			2
‘ my breaths get shorter			0
then i think i ’m going red and everyone can notice , and my hands start tingling			0
i go dizzy and light - headed and think i ’m going to have a heart attack , pass out or die			2
’ anxiety pervades @entity3 ’s everyday life			1
during our interview , he fidgets constantly , and he talks so quickly that the words tumble over each other			0
in contrast , on @entity4 he comes across as a brash , flash , ladies ’ man			1
but the brashness , he says , is all an act , and harks back to his teenage years when he would intentionally seek confrontation			0
‘ at times i knew a panic attack was coming and the only way to relieve it was to shout at the person putting me in that position			1
it often ended in a fight			0
’ on - screen style : @entity3 never showed his anxiety to costars @entity83 and @entity84 , left and far right , and @entity85 , but kept a confident front that instinct – to fight – is one of two classic responses			1
the other – flight – is more common			0
‘ adrenaline is a hormone that evolved in humans to help us fend off danger , either by attacking or running away fast , ’ explains psychotherapist @entity91			0
adrenaline causes the blood pressure to rise , the heart to beat faster and superficial blood vessels to constrict , thus preparing the body for action			0
‘ the problem with anxiety disorders is that the same hormonal response to physical danger arises in situations that are not dangerous , ’ adds @entity91			2
the disorder is usually fuelled by a ‘ storm ’ of anxious thoughts			2
‘ sufferers have an initial panicky feeling , which triggers adrenaline release			0
in turn , this prompts a physical reaction such as sweating or palpitations , which then alerts them that something alarming is going on , and it makes them panic more , ’ says @entity91			1
trigger : @entity3 suffered a panic attack when ex @entity17 discussed their breakup on the show ‘ they can then feel out of control , terrified about what ’s happening to their mind and body , and the panic escalates			1
’ the good news is that there are plenty of ways to manage , prevent and overcome such attacks			2
‘ the trick , ’ says @entity91 , ‘ is to identify anxiety in its earliest stage , challenge the thoughts provoking it , reassure yourself , and slow your breathing so the body stops thinking it ’s in danger			2
’ with practice , many people can achieve this transformation themselves , although others opt for psychotherapy , particularly cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity150 )			0
this is the most effective treatment as the therapist can teach sufferers how to halt the downward spiral			0
@entity3 traces his problems to when his parents separated when he was five years old			1
from then on , his main contact with his father was talking on the telephone – something @entity3 always found upsetting			1
‘ it sounds silly , but i could n’t talk to someone i could n’t see in case they were laughing at me			0
’ during adolescence , @entity3 ’s anxieties spread , and he suffered his first panic attack , aged 18 , in a clothes shop			1
‘ i went to return an item and the assistant said , “ sorry , you need the receipt			0
” i felt everyone was looking at me			0
i went bright red , started panicking , and ran out			0
i still ca n’t return clothes – i have a wardrobe full of things that do n’t fit			0
’ another trigger came when he started doing personal appearances as @entity4 ’s popularity grew – standing in front of a club full of people filled him with dread			1
eventually , @entity3 sought help through a @entity150 therapist			1
‘ i only went four times but he made me visualise crowds giving me a positive reception			0
he taught me to slow down my breathing and , even if i feel scared , to grab the bull by the horns and do it anyway			0
’ last year @entity3 started playing the piano and also discovered another surprising pastime that helps keep him calm – baking			2
‘ i love it ! ’ he beams			0
now with a clutch of coping mechanisms , @entity3 feels his anxiety is nearly under control and is tired of hiding his problem			1
‘ i do n’t want to put on a front any longer			0
i ’ve had enough of pretending – it ’s a prison			0
