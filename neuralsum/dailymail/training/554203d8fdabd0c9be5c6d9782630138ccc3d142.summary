@entity1 , who had suffered a series of mini-strokes over the past decade , recognised the symptoms as she fell ill in the luxurious room , ' but this was the one that killed her ' , a friend said today			1

room : @entity1 had been staying in this suite at the @entity23 in @entity24 , where she had been living since @entity25 as she recovered from an operation ' she had been having a series of blips and this was just another one			1
she recognised the symptoms and that she was having a little stroke and this was the one the killed her			2
the doctor was called but it was very quick , ' the friend told @entity37			1
final days : @entity1 had spent the last months of her life in the hotel as her health failed it is still unclear what @entity1 was reading when she died , but insiders say it could have been that morning 's newspapers			1

then , at @entity25 , she went to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder			1
when she came out she was very uncertain on her feet , and a return home was out of the question			0
