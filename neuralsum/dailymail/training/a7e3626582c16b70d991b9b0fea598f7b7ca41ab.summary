losing 22 - 0 would normally be seen as a disaster – but when it is a non-league side facing @entity3 's under - 19 national side then it is important to take the positives			1
on an afternoon when @entity7 were beating @entity8 at @entity9 and @entity10 returned to winning ways against @entity12 , @entity6 were trending higher on @entity13 thanks to their thrashing			2
@entity16 , currently seventh in the @entity18 first division , found themselves on the end of the heaviest defeat in the club ’s history when they faced the @entity25			1
on sunday , it took @entity3 's youngsters just four minutes to go 1 - 0 up			1
by half time it was 9 - 0 and @entity16 had no substitutes available			2
in between , though , they were rather excited when the home side edged forward as @entity16 wrote on @entity13 : ' we 've got a corner ! ! ' but the main positives to be taken from the defeat is that the club ’s @entity13 account saw its followers double			2
speaking to @entity58 , @entity6 ’s website and social media manager @entity61 said : ‘ we played @entity43 in a pre-season summer friendly , and there was a contact who got back in touch with us and said the @entity68 side were knocking around in the @entity69 and would we like to play them			1
‘ if you are a football club at level 10 of the pyramid and someone approaches you and asks if you would like to have a go at the @entity25 then you are not going to turn them down			0
‘ to the best of my knowledge it is the heaviest defeat in the club ’s history			2
but in the club ’s defence we have three squads , the @entity84 , the reserves and also the @entity86			0
all three squads had matches this weekend and what we put out was a bit of a scratch squad			0
‘ to be fair , the @entity92 were technically superb and even if we had put out our strongest xi then we would still have been on the end of a very severe beating			1
’ @entity16 return to league action on wednesday when they face @entity98 , and @entity61 thinks one or two of the players may need an arm around the shoulder as they try and forget about this scoreline			0
