moving against tax avoidance by corporations , the @entity1 administration took several actions on monday to curb ' inversion ' deals that allow companies to escape high @entity9 taxes by reincorporating abroad			1
the @entity10 announced new rules , effective immediately , that will reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted , while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding			1
because they took effect on monday , the new rules might raise issues for some of a handful of companies that have agreed to do inversions , but have not yet completed them			0
fast - food chain @entity21 is in the midst of inverting to @entity23 in a deal with coffee - and - donuts vendor @entity25 a spokeswoman for @entity21 said the company declined to comment			1
asked about the impact on pending deals , a senior @entity10 official told reporters on a conference call : ' if they are closed and done as of today , then they are not subject to this			2
if they are closed tomorrow or after , they are subject to this			0
' @entity9 treasury secretary @entity35 is the driving force behind a new policy that penalizes companies for avoiding tax es by merging with overseas companies -- a scheme known as a corporate inversion president @entity1 , who has sharply criticized inverting companies , said the @entity10 's steps would ' discourage companies from taking advantage of corporate inversions - moving their tax residence overseas on paper to avoid paying their fair share in taxes here at home			1
' the announcement of the rules followed months of growing concern on @entity57 , with @entity58 urging prompt legislative action and @entity60 pushing to address the problem later , perhaps in 2015 , as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole - riddled federal tax code			0
companies that do inversions , which are legal and already subject to certain restrictions , say they are only trying to minimize their tax bills , which investors expect			1
about 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s , but half of those have been completed just since the 2008 - 2009 credit crisis , according to a @entity78 review			0
inversions have surged in the past year , pursued by big companies such as @entity21 and medical technology group @entity81 , which is working to close an inversion deal into @entity83 with rival @entity84 @entity81 spokesman @entity85 late on monday told @entity78 : ' we are studying @entity10 's actions			1
we will release our perspective on any potential impact on our pending acquisition of @entity84 following our complete review			0
' @entity81 has said it expects to close the @entity84 acquisition by the end of this year or early 2015			2
inversions usually involve a @entity9 corporation buying a smaller , foreign rival and redomiciling in its home country , where taxes are lower , even though core operations typically remain in the @entity9			1
treasury secretary @entity35 said in a statement : ' these first , targeted steps make substantial progress in constraining the creative techniques used to avoid @entity9 taxes , both in terms of meaningfully reducing the economic benefits of inversions after the fact , and when possible , stopping them altogether			2
' a key target of @entity10 's actions is foreign profits held offshore by @entity9 multinationals under a @entity9 @entity115 ( @entity115 ) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the @entity9			1
deal : fast - food chain @entity21 is in the midst of inverting to @entity23 in a deal with coffee - and - donutsvendor @entity25 one new @entity10 rule will prevent inverted companies from using ' hopscotch ' loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax - deferred foreign profits			1
another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using ' decontrolling ' strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer @entity9 - controlled			2
@entity10 is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former @entity9 owners can have in an inverted company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the @entity115 , a move that will make it harder to do these deals			1
some companies had feared that new rules might be imposed retroactively , but they were not			0
@entity146 , chief political strategist at @entity147 , said the administration ' may succeed in chilling the climate for further deals , but this was not as strident as it could have been , especially in that they do n't do anything retroactively			0
' the rules were the administration 's latest effort to tackle what it sees as a pressing issue by taking executive actions that side - step a gridlocked @entity161			0
' when corporations choose to invert and do n't pay their fair share of taxes , they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab , ' said @entity58 senator @entity169 in a statement			0
' today , the @entity1 administration put these corporate tax deserters on notice : we are not going to stand by while they game the tax code and avoid their responsibility to our country , ' @entity169 said			0
though in disagreement about the issue 's urgency , both @entity58 and @entity60 have said inversions are a symptom of a broken tax code that needs a thorough overhaul , a job that has eluded @entity161 and successive presidents since 1986			2
senator @entity187 , the top @entity60 on the tax law - writing @entity188 , said in a statement : ' in the end , any solution that permanently addresses inversions must be legislated by @entity161			0

common scheme sees @entity9 companies merging with foreign corporations so their taxes can be calculated at another country 's lower rate
@entity10 loses billions every year from these deals
@entity21 's plan to merge with the @entity23 chain @entity206 's *sparked* urgency in the @entity207
investors expect companies to minimize their tax bills but the @entity207 now expects them to stay *headquartered* in the @entity9 regardless of the cost
