by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 01:33 est , 3 october 2012 hate preacher @entity3 is ill because he ca n’t get enough sleep in his ‘ harsh ’ prison cell , his lawyers complained yesterday			1
they want judges to halt his extradition to the @entity8 so he can have an mri scan to establish if he is fit to travel			1
it is the latest legal delaying tactic in a case which has already taken eight years and cost the @entity13 taxpayer more than £ 1million			1
' deteriorating health ' : @entity3 asked the @entity15 to grant him time for an @entity9 as he renewed a long - running legal battle to halt his extradition from the @entity13 to the @entity8 if the @entity15 rejects the appeal , the hook - handed @entity19 fanatic could finally be on a plane to @entity8 – where he is wanted for running a terrorist training camp – by the middle of the month			1
@entity3 ’s previous argument that it would be a breach of his human rights to imprison him for decades in a @entity8 jail was rejected by judges in @entity28 last week			1
now he has changed tactics by saying he has ‘ deteriorating health ’ and it would be ‘ oppressive ’ to kick him out in his condition			0
in papers before two judges in @entity34 , @entity36 ’s @entity35 , @entity37 , argues there is ‘ medical opinion that a [ @entity9 ] scan is medically necessary ’			2
the @entity35 says a judge referred to @entity3 ’s ‘ very poor health ’ at an extradition hearing in 2008			1
the papers continue : ‘ over four years later , it appears there has been , or may have been , a further deterioration , perhaps attributable to sleep deprivation and the continued confinement of the appellant in an unrelentingly harsh environment			0
’ the @entity35 said home secretary @entity53 had been asked in august for a scan to take place in jail , but the request had been ‘ ignored ’			0
legal fight : @entity36 's @entity59 @entity37 appealed to the @entity15 ( pictured ) that @entity3 's deteriorating health might be caused by sleep deprivation @entity3 lost his arms and one eye on what he claims was a de-mining mission in @entity66			1
an mri scan can determine if a patient has musculoskeletal or bone problems			0
mr @entity37 admits in his written submissions that , after further medical tests are carried out and considered by doctors on both sides , ‘ there may be no issue ’			1
but he insisted that at present ‘ it can not possibly be said there is no issue ’			0
he is expected to make more submissions on @entity3 ’s behalf today , before judges reach a verdict on whether to grant an injunction , delaying his removal			1
the judges are also considering challenges by @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , all of whom are wanted by the @entity8 authorities on terrorism charges			2
none of the men was in court yesterday			0
@entity3 was recently moved from @entity98 jail , in @entity34 , to @entity99 , in @entity100 , where the others are held			2
it has fuelled speculation they could be transported to the @entity8 together once their appeals are exhausted			2
@entity3 , who was jailed for seven years for soliciting to murder and inciting racial hatred , has been fighting extradition since 2004			1
he has been charged with 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking of 16 hostages in @entity114 in 1998 , advocating violent jihad in @entity66 in 2001 , and conspiring to establish a jihad training camp in @entity117 between june 2000 and december 2001			0
plea : home secretary @entity53 has been invited to reconsider @entity88 's case who faces more than 269 counts of murder - according to his qc @entity122 @entity59 , appearing for the home secretary , argued that all the applications before the court had been brought too late and had no merit			0
he said the latest legal points could have been argued at earlier hearings months or years ago , and that they had been ‘ stored up ’ to cause unnecessary delay and amounted to an abuse of process			2
mr @entity131 told the judges : ‘ there must be finality in litigation			0
’ the judges made it clear they want the case decided quickly			0
they intend to give an ‘ indication ’ of the outcome today .			0

@entity3 has asked the @entity15 to grant him time for medical tests
was jailed for seven years for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred
