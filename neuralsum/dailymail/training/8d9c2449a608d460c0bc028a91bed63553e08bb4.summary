search - and - rescue pilot flight lieutenant @entity0 flashed her @entity2 badge at the security gate of @entity4 in @entity5			1
it showed her as she had appeared just a few weeks earlier … as a man			2
‘ in you go , ma’am , ’ said the guard			2
‘ do n’t worry , you are n’t the first and you wo n’t be the last , ’ his words acknowledging the fact that @entity0 was returning to work as a woman			1
@entity16 , 34 , is a decorated @entity17 officer who is @entity18 ’s first and only openly transgender military pilot			1
she has been , she says , ‘ one of the boys as both a man and a woman ’			1
among the colleagues she told in a series of emotionally gruelling one - on - one meetings was prince @entity27 , who was at the time a fellow co-pilot within the tight - knit team of 20 at @entity4			1
flt lieut @entity30 with her sea king helicopter during a training exercise in the @entity34 in 2012 he showed support and understanding			0
the royal wedding in 2011 was one of @entity41 ’s first work - related outings after transition			1
she attended as a woman , accompanied by her wife @entity45 , a doctor with whom she now lives in a lesbian relationship			1
‘ all my @entity17 colleagues were brilliant , ’ she says			1
‘ i think they were surprised because i was pretty adept at pretending to be a man			0
i walked macho , i sat macho , i worked out hard and i like a bit of banter			1
‘ but when i came back as a woman there was complete acceptance and empathy			1
even old and bold warrant officers who had grown up in the days when people like me would have been taken behind the bike sheds for a kicking , came to congratulate me			0
‘ i can see why someone might think it ’s been difficult			0
men go to war , women stay at home and mind the children – that ’s the traditional military narrative			1
but being transgender in the @entity17 has been , in some ways , easier than in civilian life			1
‘ the military has a policy and there are rules and what we do is adhere to them			1
even this , ’ she says with a smile			0
the most striking thing about @entity16 is how far her androgynous elegance is removed from the cruel stereotype of a transgender woman			1
as a woman she ’s neither confusing nor cartoonish ; she is unmistakably feminine even if she was assigned a male gender at birth			1
among @entity41 's first work - related outings as a woman was the @entity90 in 2011 which she attended with her partner @entity45 ( pictured left ) today she ’s sitting in the quarters she shares with @entity45 at @entity95 in @entity96			1
with their cats , their aquarium , piles of books and a roast cooking in the kitchen , the couple ’s home life is a picture of ordinary domestic contentment			0
it ’s one they hope to complete with a baby of their own , born using sperm frozen before @entity0 underwent transition			1
yet life was not always so stable			0
in her first newspaper interview , @entity16 reveals how she came close to killing herself due to social pressure to be a fit and handsome ‘ silver - backed gorilla ’			1
she says : ‘ it was n’t me , it was n’t honest			0
from being a teenager i felt a void inside me			0
it drove me to achieve , to join the military , to fly , to qualify as a search - and - rescue pilot , but it was never , ever enough , because my essential self did n’t correspond to my external image and who could live that kind of lie ? ‘ i knew i was n’t a gay man , i could n’t tick that box			1
but it is a huge step to ask yourself if you might be transgender because of the stigma attached to it			1
' you know you risk being ostracised , ridiculed , belittled and made to feel somehow less human			0
you are the punchline in a big joke , or worse , still deemed to have a psychological condition			0
‘ you are considered a freak and you put your career , your family ties and your friendships on the line			0
that ’s why you deny it , why you deny it even to yourself until the need to do something about it is so overwhelming it makes life impossible – truly impossible			0
’ by impossible the officer means killing herself			0
she declines to go into detail but she admits she contemplated suicide			0
‘ my whole life felt empty and worthless and in the end it came down to simple mathematics – either i could transition or i could kill myself			1
’ that she survived is down to two things : a marriage that was ultimately defined by love and not gender , and the support of the @entity17			1
she can not stress enough that a military environment in which she is judged on her professional skills and not by her sexuality or gender has been an unexpectedly comfortable place to be			1
‘ it ’s not unfair to say that women in the military are often one of the boys			2
being gay , being trans , being a woman in a man ’s world – they are all easier because this work is very task - focused			1
‘ people worry first and foremost about your ability to do the job			0
‘ i was worried i would have to surrender my flying career but i was wrong , just as my fears about losing the love of my family and friends were unfounded			0
i was quietly confident i would keep my marriage but i could n’t know : @entity45 married a man			0
’ the couple , who say they were both bisexual , met in a ju jitsu class during their first year of university at @entity195 where the future @entity16 was reading ecology			2
‘ it was love at first throw , ’ she jokes			0
they were together for eight years before marrying six years ago in a civil ceremony at a @entity204 stately home			0
by then @entity0 was , with @entity45 ’s support , already living as a woman outside of work and family events			1
the 34 - year - old said being part of the @entity17 had made the transition surprisingly more comfortable she was born in @entity204 , the youngest of three siblings			1
her parents , @entity214 and @entity215 , ran a smallholding and let holiday cottages			0
the rural environment made it easier for their son to ignore the fact that he did not relate to the world as a boy			0
‘ i knew i was different from the age of four but i had no words of explanation			0
‘ the fact that i had a loving family made it easy not to press the question			0
but going to university meant leaving home and i spent all my time looking for the next thing , the thing which would complete me			0
’ at @entity195 she joined the university air squadron and from there she signed up for a short - term commission in the @entity17			1
she completed her officer training at @entity239 in @entity240 , and then volunteered for search - and - rescue			2
‘ i am not a blue - light chaser , ’ she says			2
‘ it sounds grandiose but i wanted to do a job that involved helping others			0
’ she joined @entity4 in 2007 and was fully operational by the end of 2009 , co-piloting a @entity247 – the same role as prince @entity27 – along with a pilot , a winchman and a radar operator			1
today she works 24 - hour shifts responding to calls from the coastguard , mountain rescue teams and the three emergency services			2
the process of transition is over now , although it took two years , three major operations and several other procedures to achieve			2
‘ i did as little as possible because i wanted to stay operationally fit and healthy , to remain a fully functioning military pilot throughout , she says			1
‘ but if you are cursed with testosterone and a y chromosome then you have to do what you need to to get yourself out of the door every morning and be accepted as a woman			2
’ to that end @entity16 has had laser treatment on facial and body hair , a hair transplant into her thinning hairline and breast implants			0
like all women she worries about hair , make - up and clothes			2
‘ it makes it easier , ’ she says , ‘ for the world to accept you as a woman if you look like one , even though that should n’t need to be the case			2
’ she has had to jump through a series of legal hoops , including changing her name by deed poll to @entity291			0
she and @entity45 chose the first name together , the middle names were given by her parents			0
‘ they ’re my parents – of course they had to choose my names , ’ she says			0
it ’s only now , four years after she began transition , that she is willing to tell her story			2
‘ why hide it ? ’ she asks			0
‘ why reinforce the taboo ? being transgender is one of the last areas of prejudice			2
‘ it ’s like race or homosexuality a generation ago and i hope that transgender people can elicit the same change in society today			2
’ the transgender community believes that 40 per cent of people attempt suicide in the years before or during transition			1
@entity16 was almost one of them			0
like all those in the military , her currency is courage			2
but no matter how many more search - and - rescue ‘ shouts ’ she answers , she will never do anything braver than discarding the man ’s body into which she was born in order to live as the woman she knows herself to be .			1
