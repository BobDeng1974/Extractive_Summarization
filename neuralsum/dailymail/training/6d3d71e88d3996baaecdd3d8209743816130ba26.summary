on the night last year , evil @entity7 wrapped his hands around her neck after jumping her from behind and started choking her before dragging her through the gates of a college and pushing her onto the ground			1
chilling cctv images show the moment @entity7 dragged @entity6 by the arm on a deserted street moments before he forced her hand down his pants			1
but , despite her terrifying ordeal , miss @entity6 managed to remain calm and persuaded @entity7 to let her go and even pretended to like him so he would let his guard down			1
incredibly , @entity43 , who waived her anonymity , managed to charm @entity7 by pretending she liked him			1
she managed to persuade him to smoke a cigarette which she knew would contain his dna			0
after he dropped the butt on the ground , miss @entity6 made a mental note where it was			2
as the pair were getting closer to @entity43 's parent ’s home in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity7 was distracted by a phone call and he said he had to leave			2
attack : @entity43 ( right ) is captured on cctv being dragged away by @entity7 drag : the murderer tries to pull @entity43 further towards him and away from the street when the attacker disappeared she called police and told them where to find @entity7 ’s cigarette butt			1

' i think he was so shocked by my reaction that he let me go			0
i reassured him i would n’t make a sound			0
he took a step back and i knew my plan was working			0
trapped : @entity7 continued trying to talk to @entity43 as she tried to get away quick - thinking : while @entity7 grabbed her miss @entity6 managed to charm the attacker by persuading him she liked him ' inside , i was terrified i asked him how his night had been and said , " you ’re heading in the same direction as me			1

' people have said that i was brave and that i did really well to stay calm			0
attempts : miss @entity6 's wise words eventually worked and @entity7 let her go , allowing him to smoke a cigarette ' hopefully , it will make people think twice about how they react , and mainly just make them think about staying calm			1
' detective chief inspector @entity125 , of @entity126 , said : ' @entity6 is simply an astonishing young lady			2
she had periods where the events of that night caused her real issues			2
