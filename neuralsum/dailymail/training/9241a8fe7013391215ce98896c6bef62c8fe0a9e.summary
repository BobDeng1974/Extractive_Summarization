by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 2 october 2013 a transgender woman unhappy with her masculine features has revealed that she sold her house in order to finance a £ 15,000 surgical makeover			2
@entity6 , 56 , had been left frustrated by the size of her nose and masculine jawline before discovering a procedure called facial feminisation surgery after an online search			1
the operation , which softens and feminises the features , is n't available on the @entity15 but fed up with her masculine looks , she took the dramatic step of putting her house on the market to pay for it			2
change for the better : @entity6 as she looks now ( left ) and as she looked when living as a man named @entity20 ( right ) happier : @entity6 says she would do the same thing all over again if needed and feels far more confident now bruising : @entity6 pictured immediately after the operation in 2009 after selling her three bedroom , semi-detached @entity25 home , @entity6 underwent extensive surgery to reshape her nose , forehead and jawline			1
@entity6 , who was born a boy named @entity20 , had always felt herself to be a woman trapped in a man 's body and began secretly wearing female clothes as a young adult before deciding to live as a woman full - time in her late thirties but lacked confidence because of her looks			1
' since having facial feminisation surgery , i ’ve never looked back , ' she said			1
' it ’s been worth every penny as i ’m just so much more confident now			2
' it meant so much to me that i sold my house to have the operation and i ’d do the same again			2
i think many others in my position would go to the same lengths			0
' some of the changes have been small , but they ’ve made such a difference to me			1
i feel so much better when i look in the mirror			0
' miss @entity6 was in theatre for six hours as surgeons reconstructed her nose , forehead and jawline , during the 2009 operation at @entity60 in @entity61			1
she was so pleased with the outcome that she became a full - time ambassador for @entity64 , a group of surgeons who perform the surgery across the globe			2
she now provides support to scores of surgery candidates worldwide and has even observed operations firsthand			2
' it ’s made such a difference to me , ' she added			1
' before , i never wanted anyone to see me in profile , as i thought i looked too masculine , whereas now i feel much more comfortable			2
' however , i think it ’s important that transgender people are realistic about the results - the surgeons do n’t have a magic wand and sometimes the changes can be very subtle			0
' but i ’ve worked with some younger people to whom it ’s made an absolutely massive difference - it ’s better to get facial feminisation surgery at a young age , if possible			1
much improved : @entity6 ( left ) says she always felt like a woman trapped in a man 's body , even when married future : @entity6 says she hopes that facial feminisation surgery will one day be available on the @entity15 ' we call these women " invisible " transgenders , because it ’s virtually impossible to tell they were born in male bodies			1
' a former car salesperson , miss @entity6 first suspected that she was a woman trapped in a male body when she was just seven			1
she struggled with her identity for almost 30 years , joining a rugby team as a young man in a bid to fit in with her male peers			0
she was in a marriage for several years , which led to the birth of a daughter , but the relationship broke down as she attempted to come to terms with her situation			0
' from an early age , i knew that i wanted to be a girl but , back then , these things were n’t talked about			0
' i felt lucky to have met a lovely woman and i genuinely do think i was in love with my wife , but the desire to be the woman you feel like inside never goes away			0
' after my marriage broke down , i realised i could n’t go on as i was			0
when i decided to go out dressed as a woman for the first time , i was terrified			0
i was trembling so much i did n’t think i ’d make it past the front door			0
' but in the end it was a really liberating experience			0
becoming @entity6 felt like being reborn			1
' miss @entity6 , who is single , moved to a rented cottage in @entity129 , @entity130 , after selling her property in june 2009 to pay for her operation			1
despite her extensive surgery , she has no plans to have a full sex change			0
she believes facial feminisation surgery should one day be available on the @entity15 , as is currently the case with conventional gender reassignment surgery			1
' looking to the long term , it would be great if facial feminisation surgery was eventually available on the @entity15 , ' she explained			1
' it would be very costly , in terms of carrying out the operations and putting doctors through the relevant qualifications			0
' but this is n’t just an aesthetic thing - many women like me feel that they need this surgery in order to achieve integration			0

@entity6 , 56 , sold her @entity156 home to pay for the op
she says facial feminisation surgery has made a huge difference
says she now feels more confident and comfortable than *previously*
