the @entity0 is set to unveil its big weapon for the general election campaign – a sultry , pouting , middle - aged ‘ boyband ’ comprising @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
the party , which is languishing at six per cent in the polls , is recruiting lookalikes to portray the four main party leaders in a cringe - inducing party political broadcast due to be screened next month			1
strangely , the @entity14 are even hiring an actress to play their own leader , the gaffe - prone @entity16 , and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates			1
strategists stipulate that her doppelganger be in her late 30s to mid- 40s – although @entity22 is 49 – and be ‘ like a schoolteacher , life experience under her belt			2
she must also be ‘ the voice of reason , friendly , warm and approachable but has a message to get across ’			1
the full excruciating details of what the @entity14 believe is ‘ a fun , clever and refreshing idea ’ is revealed in a leaked casting brief			1
fake that : our mock - up of ( left to right ) party leaders @entity5 , @entity7 , @entity6 and @entity8 as a boyband it adds that four male party leaders ’ lookalikes ‘ should be unnaturally intense , emotional and passionate – like a boyband			1
loads of smouldering stares , deep thinking and soulful singing			2
thick lashings of powerful slow motion movements and pensive gazes will help intensify the drama			2
‘ they may be leaders of different parties , but they seem to know the same lyrics to the same song and be in perfect harmony			1
i like the idea that as the song builds and climaxes , they are literally finishing off each others sentences … that is how ridiculously in harmony they are			1
‘ above all , they should all look incredibly pleased with themselves			2
it will be amusing to have disgruntled reaction shots of the other leaders at the end as the @entity0 ’s common sense message is delivered			1
’ on the lookalikes , it adds : ‘ it would be great if the leaders were slightly better looking , more buff and hunkier than the actual leaders in real life			1
kind of how they see themselves inside their own minds			2
but this is not a priority			0
@entity80 and foremost they need to register as politicians			0
’ less kind critics might suggest that the @entity14 need to register as politicians themselves			1
some of the cringe - inducing lyrics of the @entity0 ’s song spoof it ’s sweeter when we agree , a party political harmony ( oh baby ) lose your voting inhibitions , join the one true coalition ( ohh - ahh - lii - shuuuuun ) let ’s frack this green and pleasant land			1
come on @entity94 , join the band the public wo n’t know what to do , if they have to pick from me and you - uuuu the choice between us could n’t be clearer			1
@entity103 ! @entity104 ! diversity for ya whether it ’s @entity108 or @entity109 , the lesser of four evils is up to you @entity113 man : how i gatecrashed world 's unfunniest send - up by @entity117 it is unusual enough to be in the same room as @entity120 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
but to be in a backstreet @entity122 studio with 13 versions of them gyrating , pouting and cavorting around was beyond bizarre			0
welcome to the casting session for what must go down as the most toe - curlingly awful party political broadcast ever			1
i secretly infiltrated the @entity0 audition under the flimsy guise of being an ersatz @entity5			1
it was clear they were desperate			0
i emailed , just hours before the audition , telling them – truthfully – that @entity133 once told me i looked like the pm			1
do n't call us : our reporter @entity117 goes to the hideously awkward audition for the @entity0 broadcast did i say they were desperate ? i heard back within minutes – and the woman did n’t ask if i was a professional actor or had an agent			1
i ’m not , clearly ! i was told that i would be auditioning for @entity5 at 2pm the next day and that the fee – just for turning up – was £ 250			0
but the email warned i should be prepared to ‘ boyband it up ’ – possibly the four most upsetting words i have ever received			1
at the offices of @entity149 , all 13 of us were told to learn our lines – which seemed a tad rich of the @entity0 when its own leader could n’t remember hers in a ‘ car crash ’ interview with @entity156 ’s @entity155 radio station			1
i hurriedly attempted to memorise the lyrics of @entity159 ’s @entity160 – the mawkish pop video for which we were set to recreate			0
then five minutes later , it all changed : we were told to forget that and instead mug up on a ‘ it ’s sweeter when we all agree ’ version			1
this was rapidly becoming more confusing than a @entity0 conference , not least because despite being middle - aged and suited , i do n’t look at all like @entity5			1
but then the other three in ‘ my ’ boyband looked nothing like their supposed doppelgangers either			1
‘ give me some smoulder , ’ the director implored			1
‘ be as seductive as you can			0
’ i ’m 44 years old , for pity ’s sake			1
i did try to smoulder , which is hard enough at the best of times , but painfully embarrassing when you ’re told to lip - sync to a tepid backing track			1
i could n’t help thinking this was part of the democratic system our forebears died for			0
that the law requires the nation ’s broadcasters to actually screen this rubbish			0
@entity189 loomed when some portly chap – i have no idea whose lookalike he was supposed to be – admitted he did n’t have a suit with him			2
desperate : the @entity14 are even hiring an actress to play their own leader , the gaffe - prone @entity16 ( pictured ) , and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates the sweet woman in charge duly dispatched him to @entity202 , telling him to take it back for a refund ‘ after the gig ’			1
then the internet went down			0
oh , and they could n’t work out how to play the track			2
then it was the volume control			0
i rang my wife at this point			0
‘ is this @entity213 ? ’ came her reply			2
finally , after an anxious , 30 - minute delay during which the pros gargled noisily and massaged their vocal cords , and i – um – did n’t , we were on			2
the brief rehearsal was over and this was the real audition			2
i was in the first batch of hopefuls , which i took as a promising sign			0
we were escorted into a small , bright room			0
behind the camera were an assortment of trendy types in lumberjack shirts and lots of facial hair			0
we read out our names and posed for profile shots			0
we then had to mime along to the song			0
‘ try to emote like a real boyband , ’ said the director patiently			2
‘ really go for it			0
’ i did try to channel my inner one direction but i ended up looking like i was having a fit in the deep end of a swimming pool			2
we carried on prancing about , nonetheless			0
then , worryingly , the @entity7 double cuddled me – i do n’t quite know why – as we moved into the second verse			0
truly hideous : reporter @entity117 described his efforts as ' @entity244 at a teenage disco : excruciating and slightly off ' @entity247 it ai n’t , but the @entity14 clearly hope this song will ram home their point : when there ’s little to divide the main party leaders , vote for us instead			1
next , we were told to ‘ seduce ’ the camera , one by one			2
i pouted , foolishly , and even tried a little growl			0
one of the crew tittered , not unreasonably , as i awkwardly caressed my chest and even smoothed my eyebrow with a licked finger			0
yes , it was truly that hideous			0
imagine @entity244 at a teenage disco : excruciating and slightly off			0
finally , we had to mime to camera as if we were making a political speech			0
we all flapped the air and did that funny pointy thing with our thumbs that @entity5 likes to do			0
the @entity6 lookalike – the only one even remotely like his famous ‘ double ’ – got especially carried away , letting out an impressive glottal volley of gibberish			2
eventually , we were done , much to everybody ’s relief			0
‘ you ’ll be hearing from us if you ’ve been successful , ’ said an assistant			2
we could say the same of the @entity0			0
they should n’t hold their breath .			0

cringe - inducing short film will include actors playing all four party leaders
greens are even hiring actress to play their own leader , @entity16
