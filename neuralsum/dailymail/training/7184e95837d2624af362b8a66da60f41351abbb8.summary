one of @entity1 's longest married couples have been wed over seven decades without a single row			1
since marrying in 1941 , @entity3 and @entity4 from @entity5 , @entity6 , have survived @entity7 , a bout of tropical thrombosis and a stint in an iron lung			1
not only that , but the husband and wife endured it all without arguing once			0
@entity3 , 97 , an ex toolmaker and serviceman - come - milkman , and @entity27 , 93 , who worked in @entity29 's factories during the @entity30 , first met when she was pushing a bike near her home			1
a man walking nearby shouted out , ' @entity34 , would you like to hold me up like that ? ' she said : ' that was it , we were together after that			0
' @entity3 added : and you know what ? we 've never argued since that day , ' he explained			1
the couple on their wedding day at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , in 1941 the couple say the key to such a long marriage was mutual discussion , a clear understanding of one another 's needs			1
speaking to the @entity56 , @entity27 said : ' i take no notice - if he 's a bit up i throw it away - throw it to the wind			0
' if there 's a disagreement , the couple sit down and talk it out instead of raising their voices			1
she said : ' i say what 's my view and he says what 's his view and we argue it out like that			0
' we 're married - he 's mine and i 'm his and that 's how we look at it			0
' we talk things over			1
' @entity83 in @entity47 in 1944 ( left ) and @entity3 in @entity84 in 1943 ( right @entity3 added : ' there 's no need to argue			2
' if we find anything we 're going to argue over we discuss it			0
' if people talked things over there 'd be no wars on earth			0
' @entity3 , who served in the @entity30 , contracted tropical thrombosis , a life threatening condition , while serving in @entity97 , @entity84 and was rushed home			2
@entity83 was terrified for @entity3 's life , but thankfully he eventually recovered			2
she said : ' it was as if the heavens opened up for me on that day and it 's like they 've never closed since			0
' @entity3 and @entity83 credit their long marriage with the fact that they always talk things through , instead of rowing @entity3 cheated death once again when he had a lump removed from his lung , causing him to spend weeks in an iron lung			1
and later on in the war , the couple narrowly escaped being hit by a bomb after the family dog detected a dropped bomb that had n't yet gone off			2
one night , while they were playing cards in @entity27 's mother 's home , their dog suddenly leapt up and sought refuge under an iron - framed piano and whimpered			0
