risk : the new study suggests drinking more than a couple of glasses of wine early in pregnancy can harm a child 's brain just one night out during pregnancy can have long - lasting effects on the child ’s behaviour , a study suggests			1
youngsters exposed to one or two binges of alcohol in the womb were more likely to have short attention spans and be badly behaved at the age of seven , it said			2
a binge was classified as two - and - a - half large glasses of wine or more			0
this could concern many women who enjoy drinks with friends before realising they are pregnant			1
the @entity28 study tracked the health of more than 30,000 babies born to women who had been asked about drinking in pregnancy			1
a binge was defined as downing at least 7.5 units of alcohol in one session , with a large wine containing three units			0
when the children were seven , the mothers filled in a another questionnaire about their behaviour			1
the results revealed the lasting influence of binge drinking in pregnancy			0
the impact was much bigger on children whose mothers drank in late pregnancy but subtle differences occurred in those exposed to binges early on			1

@entity99 , author of @entity100 , said other studies hint that babies are particularly sensitive to alcohol in weeks seven to 12 , by which time many more women know they are pregnant .			1
