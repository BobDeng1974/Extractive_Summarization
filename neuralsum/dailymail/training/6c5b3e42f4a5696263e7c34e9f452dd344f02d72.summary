by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:42 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 06:47 est , 14 may 2013 the cost of fruit and vegetables will soar unless @entity6 opens its borders to more foreign workers , it was warned today			1
prices for strawberries and celery in particular could rise , because of a shortage of cheap labour			2
the @entity14 said supermarkets will be forced to push up prices or import more food , piling pressure on @entity6 farmers			1
a shortage of migrant workers when employment rules change could push up the price of fruit and vegetables , the @entity14 said almost 22,000 @entity25 and @entity26 are employed under the seasonal agricultural workers scheme but it is due to close when access restrictions are lifted at the end of 2013			1
@entity6 growers fear a shortage of workers could lead to a surge in labour costs and ultimately higher prices for consumers			1
professor @entity38 , @entity14 chair , said the government should consider proposals for a new scheme that targets non-eu workers			1
in particular countries which have a high number of agricultural students such as the @entity46 could be targeted			2
mr @entity38 told a press conference that if the labour supply ‘ dwindled ’ once the scheme closed to @entity25 and @entity26 , operators may have to ‘ drive wages up ’ to secure staff			1
he said : ; in those circumstances , therefore , it 's possible that supermarkets would charge higher prices for their celery and strawberries and so on			0
’ the price of strawberries in particular could rise , the chairman of the @entity14 professor @entity38 said mr @entity38 said supermarkets may also start to import produce from overseas to keep consumer prices competitive			1
‘ if the growers need to pay much higher wages , the prices to the supermarket would go up then , it 's possible then imports would go up			0
’ mr @entity38 said the consequences of a shrinking labour supply include seeing the whole horticulture sector in @entity6 contract and lead to an increase in technology being used instead of manual labour			1
mr @entity38 said considering an alternative source of employment - such as countries outside the @entity81 - was ‘ a matter for the government ’			0
he added : ‘ it 's very important to emphasise that , if we did have a replacement source , the implication is that horticulture is a favoured sector			0
‘ it gets a supply of cheap labour , reliable labour and , more importantly , hired labour which is not available to any other sector			0
’ he added : ‘ the only way that we should have a replacement scheme is if such a scheme would help horticulture thrive in the long run and the evidence from stake holders is that it would do			0
’ last month farming minister @entity104 warned families they will have to grow more of their own fruit and vegetables to cope with food shortages			2
he recast the famous @entity110 slogan urging @entity111 to ‘ dig for victory ’ with a stark warning of the need to ‘ dig for survival ’ in the future			0
farming minister @entity104 has warned families to consider growing more of their own fruit and vegetables if @entity6 is hit by a food shortage crisis fruit prices are more than 10 per cent higher than last year with vegetable costs up 6.7 per cent			1
mr @entity104 said : ‘ with an increasing population , increasing demand not just in this country but across the world , we are going to have to increase food production			0
‘ we made a huge mistake a few years ago when the idea got around that we did n't need to produce in the agricultural sector any more , that we would be able to buy our way through whatever was necessary to feed the country			0
‘ once we used to “ dig for victory ”			0
there may come a time soon when we need to “ dig for survival ”			0
’ the @entity14 said a lack of seasonal workers was a medium to long term risk with @entity6 farmers likely to be able to recruit a sufficient number in the first one to two years after the working restrictions on @entity26 and @entity25 are lifted			1
a @entity144 spokeswoman said : ‘ we are grateful for the @entity14 's report and note its conclusion that that there is little evidence the supply of seasonal labour will decline in the next one or two years			2
‘ we shall consider the @entity14 's advice very carefully , however in general we want to encourage employers to recruit from the resident labour market where possible			2

rules to end allowing @entity25 and @entity26 to work in @entity6
