@entity0 turns 48 today but it will be @entity2 with something to celebrate			1
as the prime minister marks his birthday in @entity8 , some 80 miles away in @entity5 history is being made as voters go to the polls in the by - election triggered by @entity14 mp @entity13 's defection			1
polls suggest @entity2 will easily win the seat , giving the party its first elected mp in the commons which @entity20 hails as a ' new dawn ' in @entity23 politics			1
he has not voted because he officially lives in @entity32 mr @entity13 stunned @entity33 with his decision to defect from the @entity35 in august polls have put @entity2 on course to win up to 6,000 more votes than the @entity14 , in what is set to be a humiliating by - election defeat for mr @entity0			1
in a separate by - election being held today , @entity41 is expected to hold its @entity44 and @entity45 seat but @entity2 could break through 30 per cent to come second			1
mr @entity20 told the @entity46 : ' it is a new dawn			2
it is the end of the closed shop of two - and - a - half party politics			2
' winning the @entity52 elections was an earthquake			0
@entity5 is a shift in the tectonic plates of @entity23 politics			1
and if we win in @entity44 and @entity45 , it will be @entity59			1
' at the 2010 general election mr @entity13 won the seat with a 12,000 majority for the @entity35 , and @entity2 did not stand against the prominent @entity63			1
the @entity35 have been rocked by mr @entity13 's defection in august , which was followed by @entity65 switching parties on the eve of the @entity14 last month			1
@entity2 leader @entity20 , pictured in @entity5 today , has hailed the prospect of gaining a seat in the @entity70 as a ' new dawn ' mr @entity20 was out on the campaign trail in @entity5 today , drumming up support for mr @entity13 @entity2 supporters hope victory in @entity5 will lead to more mps being elected at the 2015 general election mr @entity13 and mr @entity20 staged a bizarre visit to @entity79 today , where they ate @entity81 icecreams @entity13 was one of the most prominent @entity63 @entity14 mps but his defection to @entity2 in august was still a major surprise in @entity33			1
the libertarian @entity5 mp regularly spoke out against the government on @entity52 , the economy and parliamentary reform			2
the maverick backbencher once led calls for @entity82 ’ expenses to be opened up to the public – but was then criticised after it emerged he claimed cash back for a ‘ love chair ’ for his home			0
he is popular among many of his former @entity14 his colleagues , some of whom refused to campaign against him			0
in @entity5 his popularity outstrips that of the @entity35			1
one senior conservative said : ' there is not a @entity14 machine campaign machine in @entity5 , it is a @entity13 machine			1
' mr @entity13 grew up in @entity106 where his doctor parents worked			0
he was educated at @entity108 , @entity109 , before moving to the exclusive @entity111 boarding school in @entity112			0
senior @entity14 strategists accept they stand little chance of holding @entity5 , where mr @entity13 has a strong personal following			1
but mr @entity0 has made clear he will not give up on mr @entity120 ' @entity118 and @entity119 constituency , accusing him on betraying @entity14 activists who worked hard to get his ' fat arse ' on the @entity70 benches			0
mr @entity65 has a small lead in the polls , but the @entity14 believe they can hold it , and will head there on friday afternoon after the @entity5 result to campaign			2
the prime minister made a last ditch visit to @entity5 last week , and acknowledged the @entity35 were ' the underdogs '			1
the conservative candidate fighting mr @entity13 is @entity133 , an actor best known for his appearance as the vicar in the @entity136 ' , who is from the area and has been a local councillor for several years			0
but in a sign of the @entity14 attitude to the seat , @entity141 mayor @entity140 was caught out on live radio this week when he could not remember mr @entity133 's name			0
quizzed on the radio about the @entity14 ' chances in this week 's by - election , mr @entity140 could only venture that the candidate was a ' superb man ... @entity151 ? @entity152 ? something like that			0
' in @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity154 , @entity41 have approached the by - election with increasing panic amid concerns that @entity158 is not in touch with the voters about immigration			1
one mp said yesterday that if @entity2 finished within 2,000 votes of @entity41 there ' alarm bells would start ringing ' about mr @entity158			1
the mp , who did not wish to be named , said it would suggest that the direction of the party ' was not one that was appealing to our core voters '			0
a study last week found that the @entity2 surge could prevent @entity41 taking dozens of @entity14 target seats at the next election			1
prime minister @entity0 made a campaign visit to support @entity14 candidate @entity133 last week , but the @entity35 accept they stand little chance of holding the seat voters are also going to the polls in @entity44 in @entity154 in a by - election triggered by the death of long - standing @entity41 mp @entity182 labour voters @entity184 and @entity185 at the polling station at @entity187 , @entity188 in @entity44 voters turn out to vote at a polling station in @entity191 , for the @entity5 by - election by - elections are rarely dominated by debates on the intricacies of policy			1
more often they are a chance for voters to give the government of the day a bloody nose			1
but @entity5 is unusual , because instead of being triggered by a death or a resignation , the incumbent mp is standing again , albeit for a different party			0
the @entity206 is front and centre in the contest , with @entity13 complaining that @entity0 's @entity35 are ' not serious about real change '			2
but @entity2 is also trading on the anti-politics mood which has spread across much of the country , notably in deprived areas like @entity5			2
by far the biggest factor in mr @entity13 's likely victory is his own popularity			0
he won his first election in 2005 by just 920 votes , but was returned in 2010 with a 12,000 majority			0
the @entity35 admit they can not compete with that , but hope to do better against @entity2 in other seats			2
dr @entity222 , a politics expert at @entity223 , said : ' if @entity2 gain their first mp then the party will be in the unusual position of having a representative in parliament , but not the leader of the party			2
' in the short - term this is n't necessarily a problem			0
however if the party gains more seats , yet @entity20 fails to be elected , this could lead to possible tensions and even a leadership challenge			0
' a win for @entity2 wo n't necessarily lead to any more defections			0
' if any mp did decide to leave their party it would be difficult for them to not follow the example of @entity13 and call a by - election			2
for any mp with a small majority , or a majority based on party support , rather than their personal vote , this would be a huge gamble			0
' @entity5 has become a key battlefield in the rise of @entity2 following mr @entity13 's defection - but the region has already proven to be fertile ground for the party			1
there have been signs for some time that the loyalty of so - called " @entity262 man " - valued by the conservatives since the time of @entity265 - has been waning with voters keen to embrace an alternative			0
in recent council elections , authorities in @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 shifted from @entity14 control to no overall control after @entity2 made significant gains			2
the party also made gains in @entity278			0
all of the districts had traditionally been @entity14 strongholds			0
this success was reinforced by the @entity52 elections with @entity20 's party polling 542,812 up from 313,921 at the previous poll			2
this compared to a @entity14 vote of 446,569 .			0

@entity2 on course to deliver a bloody nose to the conservatives and @entity41
by - elections held today in @entity5 and in @entity44 and @entity45
polls suggest @entity13 will beat @entity35 in @entity5 by up to 6,000 votes
@entity41 expected to cling on in @entity44 , but with @entity2 hot on their heels
@entity20 says the ' tectonic plates ' of @entity23 politics are shifting
