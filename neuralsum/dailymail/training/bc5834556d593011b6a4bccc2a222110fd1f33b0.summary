the axe has been reinvented for the first time in 8,000 years with a new curved blade which is designed to stop momentum immediately on impact			1
retired air traffic controller @entity5 from @entity7 designed the bizarre looking @entity8 which can cut an individual piece of fire wood with just one swipe			1
but users do n’t have to worry about using the axe with too much force like with conventional axes , which do n’t stop on impact and can cause injuries			2
he developed several prototypes before the @entity19 was finalised this is because the curved design of the @entity8 stops the axe ’s momentum when it strikes the wood , reducing the risk of injury			1
mr @entity5 came up with the idea of the @entity8 , the first redesigned axe since the @entity22 , when he began clearing trees to build a new home in the forest			1
during the arduous task his axe swung dangerously close to his legs on several occasions			0
thinking of ways to make his work safer and easier , he began to develop numerous prototypes which resulted in the creation of the @entity8			2
the red coloured axe head is made from steel and weighs a little over four pounds the axe 's centre of gravity , which is n't directly above the blade but to the side , means it automatically comes down at an angle mr @entity5 , who lives in a remote forest near @entity53 , said : ‘ everybody who has tried splitting wood with a traditional axe knows that it takes a lot of power to penetrate and split the wood			2
‘ the @entity8 allows you to easily and safely start splitting suitably sized logs from the sides by striking closer to edges			0
a prehistoric stone axe , which has n't changed much in 8,000 years until the invention of the @entity8 ‘ now , there is no need to split the log in two first - you can just chop away			1
’ the red coloured axe head is made from steel and weighs a little over four pounds			0
its centre of gravity , which is n't directly above the blade but to the side , means the axe automatically comes down at an angle to split the wood			2
people wielding the axe are advised to hold the 3ft long handle loosely when bringing it down for the best results and to also avoid sore hands			0
it costs £ 158 and has been patented around the world			1
mr @entity5 added : ‘ the international interest has been so big that i have run out of stock			0
‘ there will be some delay until i have new axes available as the production is nearly all hand made			0
‘ i have ordered new stuff , but i can not get it immediately and there is a three month waiting list at the moment for new customers			0
