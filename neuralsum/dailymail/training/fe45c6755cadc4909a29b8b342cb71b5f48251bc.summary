@entity1 will not be allowed to publicly unveil new £ 75million signing @entity2 while he remains banned for biting , @entity0 has confirmed			1
@entity2 is due to complete his move from @entity4 in the next few days , and the @entity6 club has previously introduced star signings including @entity8 and @entity9 to packed stadiums			2
there have been suggestions @entity1 could hold a similar event for @entity2 in a non-football venue to get around the four - month ban imposed on the @entity17 striker for biting @entity19 's @entity18 , but @entity0 has now confirmed that any such event will not be permitted while the ban remains in force			1
he can not be in a football - related public event irrespective of the venue			0
' he can not even be involved in a football - related charity event			0
' @entity2 , 27 , had his appeal against the four - month ban , plus a nine - match international and an 100,000 @entity53 franc ( £ 66,000 ) fine , rejected outright by @entity0 's appeals committee			1
he is expected to take his appeal to the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) in a final bid to reduce the sanctions that , as they stand , will keep him out of club football until the end of october			2
name on the shirt : but @entity2 ca n't be shown off to fans at the @entity64 or elsewhere number nine : they might not be able to unveil him but @entity1 fans can already buy @entity2 's shirt different : @entity8 and @entity9 both underwent high profile unveilings at the @entity64 @entity2 can also ask @entity56 to put his ban on hold pending their final decision but that would risk him missing more matches rather than a chunk of the close season if the court upholds the sanctions			1
some 90,000 packed the @entity64 stadium for the unveiling of @entity80 forward @entity8 in june 2013			0
@entity0 's original ban took into account that @entity2 had shown no remorse for the biting incident , his third such attack in less than four years			2
the player then did issue an official apology but it did not lead to any change of mind by the @entity0 appeals panel			0
@entity2 's lawyer on friday claimed the punishment was ' blatantly draconian , totalitarian and fascist '			1
@entity93 told @entity95 radio station @entity96 : ' the right of a footballer to work is being violated , and football should be worried about that			0
' the nine ( international ) games may seem excessive , but the fact that he ca n't watch a game of football , or train or carry out his job , we are talking about unpleasant things			0
' painful blow : @entity2 's bite on @entity18 led to him getting his four - month ban from football - related activity			1

@entity1 had *planned* to unveil new striker at a non-football venue
the @entity6 club often hold *big* events to reveal new signings
but under his ban @entity2 will not be allowed to be unveiled until his entire four - month ban is served
@entity2 's lawyer calls the punishment ' draconian , totalitarian and fascist '
punishment is now likely to be appealed at @entity56
