on sunday the @entity62 commissioner @entity61 said in a statement released : ' we are very pleased with @entity6 's progress toward a complete recovery			1
' we understand how difficult this has been for @entity6 and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life			1

the lymphatic system is part of your immune system			0
@entity101 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			2
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands			0
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			2

it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50			0
almost all young people with @entity9 will be fully cured			0
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent			0
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids			2

' it 's a question of fundamental constitutional rights -- the right to have a say over what happens to your body -- and the right to say to the government ' you ca n't control what happens to my body , ' @entity6 's mother 's attorney , @entity159 , told @entity174			1

' it 's disgusting that i 'm fighting for a right that i and anyone in my situation should already have			0
' this is my life and my body , not @entity31 's and not the state 's			1
i am a human — i should be able to decide if i do or do n't want chemotherapy			0
