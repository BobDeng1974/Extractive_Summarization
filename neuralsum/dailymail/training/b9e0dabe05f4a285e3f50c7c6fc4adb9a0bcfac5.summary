by @entity1 reporter published : 17:46 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 12:40 est , 29 may 2012 if your muscles start swelling to superhero proportions after your next sushi meal , this might be why			0
researchers from @entity8 in @entity9 have discovered bluefin tuna are carrying radioactive contamination leaked from @entity13 's crippled nuclear plant all the way across the @entity15 to the @entity16 , 6,000 miles away			1
this is the first time a huge migrating fish has been shown to carry radioactivity such a distance , as they generally metabolise the contamination during their journey			2
radioactive : scientists said the increased radiation found in the @entity27 came from @entity13 's @entity29 nuclear plant that was crippled by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami nuclear : the @entity34 nuclear power plant , pictured , was badly damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami leading to a higher level of contamination in tuna ' we were frankly kind of startled , ' said researcher @entity40 , who reported the findings on monday in the @entity42			1
the levels of contamination were 10 times higher than the amount measured in tuna off the @entity48 coast in previous years			1
but even so , it 's still far below safe - to - eat limits set by the @entity16 and @entity13 governments , so is unlikely to affect humans			1
since the march 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that badly damaged the @entity34 reactors , smaller fish and plankton have been found with elevated levels of radiation in @entity13 waters			1
prized : sushi chef @entity61 poses next to a 269 kilogram bluefin tuna , which can fetch $ 24 for a thin slice at top @entity65 restaurants but scientists did not expect the nuclear fallout to linger in huge fish such as bluefin tuna , which grow to 10 feet and weigh over 1,000 pounds			1
this is because they generally shed radioactive substances easily , metabolising it as they sail the world			0
the tuna captured off the @entity48 coast were contaminated with radioactive material from the @entity29 meltdown of march last year			0
when an earthquake and tsunami struck @entity13 , they overwhelmed the defences of the @entity84 power plant , leading to the worst nuclear disaster since @entity86			2
dangerous amounts of radioactive material were carried by wind away from the plant , which is just 30 miles from the @entity15			2
when those substances - such as isotopes caesium - 134 and caesium - 137 - entered the water , they also entered the food chain and living environment of fish such as tuna			2
the face that the radioactive caesium has stayed in the tuna 's system a year later , even after a 6,000 - mile swim across the ocean , shows just how much of the isotope was released by the meltdown			1
while scientists claim that the fish is currently safe to eat , many of the effects of radioactivity on the human body are still unknown			1
five months after the @entity29 disaster , @entity40 and his team decided to test @entity15 bluefin , that spawn off the coast of @entity13 and swim east to @entity48 and @entity117			1
to their surprise , tissue samples from all 15 tuna captured off the @entity122 coast contained levels of two radioactive substances - caesium - 134 and caesium - 137 - that were higher than in previous catches			2
the scientists also analysed yellowfin tuna , found in the eastern @entity15 , and bluefin that migrated to @entity48 before the nuclear crisis , to rule out any other causes for the enhanced radiation , such as ocean currents			1
they found no trace of caesium - 134 and only background levels of caesium - 137 left over from nuclear weapons testing in the 1960s			2
the results ' are unequivocal			0
@entity29 was the source , ' said @entity141 of the @entity142			0
bluefin tuna absorbed radioactive caesium from swimming in contaminated waters and feeding on contaminated prey such as krill and squid , the scientists said			0
as the predators made the journey east , they shed some of the radiation through metabolism and as they grew larger			0
even so , they were n't able to completely flush out all the radioactivity from their system			0
' that 's a big ocean			0
to swim across it and still retain these radionuclides is pretty amazing , ' @entity40 said			0
debris : radioactive tuna is not the only casualty of the tsunami to wash up in @entity165 , as this motorbike which found its way from @entity13 to @entity168 proves can i have my ball back , please ? another @entity13 visitor to the @entity16 is a football owned by @entity173 , left , and found by @entity174 , right , on a beach in @entity176 pacific bluefin tuna are prized in @entity13 where a thin slice of the tender red meat prepared as sushi can fetch $ 24 per piece at top @entity65 restaurants			1
@entity13 consumes 80 per cent of the world 's @entity15 and @entity184 bluefin tuna			1
but researchers say the real test of how radioactivity affects tuna populations comes this summer when they plan to repeat the study with a larger number of samples			0
bluefin tuna that journeyed last year were exposed to radiation for about a month but the upcoming travelers have been swimming in radioactive waters for a longer period			0
they are also keen to track the movements of other migratory species including sea turtles , sharks and seabirds , now they know bluefin tuna can transport radiation .			0

@entity15 tuna has radiation levels 10 times higher than normal
radioactivity has remained in system on 6,000 - mile swim from @entity13 to @entity16
scientists claim fish should still be safe for *people* to eat as radiation remains below legal limit
