in a stadium holding no fans , @entity0 will face a player who made little noise during an 18 - month spell at rivals @entity6			1
but @entity7 has proved he is worth shouting about since establishing himself at @entity9			1
@entity12 , in desperate need of victory , should be wary of the danger he poses			0
@entity7 joined @entity6 aged 21 in january 2009 when sir @entity14 agreed to pay @entity15 £ 7million			1
he arrived as an exciting talent having scored 18 goals in 61 games for one of the biggest teams in his native @entity21			0
midfielder @entity7 , 27 , played just 79 minutes for @entity6 after signing for £ 7million but his career at @entity23 never really sparked into life			1
there were only five appearances , all from the bench , totaling 79 minutes in a @entity6 shirt			1
@entity7 made two appearances in the @entity30 , two in the @entity31 , and one in the @entity32 he should get more in @entity9 ’s @entity34 clash against @entity0 at the @entity35 alone			1
there were promising spells for @entity6 ’s reserve team but the @entity30 was initially too great a step up			2
@entity40 also presented a sizeable blockade to first - team progression			0
having made two appearances in the @entity30 , two in the @entity31 , and one in the @entity32 , @entity7 went on loan to @entity45 in @entity46			2
he enjoyed his time so much he wanted regular football immediately			0
when that was not on offer at @entity6 , he decided to leave for @entity9			2
he has been a tremendous success			0
now into his fifth season , he has scored 33 goals in 150 games and is a trickery winger of great threat to @entity0 ’s defence			0
@entity7 is reveling in his role as a key figure in @entity9 ’s side , but admits to feeling he may have left @entity6 too soon			1
‘ it all happened really quickly as i played for just 18 months with @entity15 , ’ @entity7 said			1
‘ we won the league and the cup and there was a period when it seemed like i was scoring in every match			0
‘ it was at that point i signed for @entity6			2
it was such an exciting moment to go there and to meet sir @entity14			1
@entity7 played against @entity0 last season in @entity9 's @entity34 defeat at the @entity75 @entity7 in action for @entity21 against @entity77 in @entity78 - he has 59 caps for his country age : 27 position : attacking midfield career path @entity85 ( 2005 - 06 ) @entity86 ( 2006 - 07 ) @entity15 ( 2007 - 09 ) @entity6 ( 2009 - 10 ) @entity45 ( 2010 , loan ) @entity9 ( 2010 - ) international @entity21 59 caps , nine goals ‘ i had grown up as a @entity6 fan so to be working for the man who had brought so much success to the club was just unbelievable			1
‘ however , there is a big difference between the @entity21 and @entity99 league and when i arrived in @entity100 i discovered i was not yet ready for that level			0
‘ i spoke with sir @entity14 many times and he kept telling me i had quality and just had to keep working hard			1
but i wanted to play more games so went to @entity45 in @entity46 on loan and had a great six months there			0
‘ when i came back to @entity100 i was expecting to play more games for @entity6 but it did n’t happen			2
in the end i was n’t sure i was going to get the chance i felt i deserved so decided to change club			0
‘ even now i am always thinking about that moment			0
maybe i should n’t have been so quick and should have worked longer to show sir @entity14			1
‘ maybe i should have stayed and fought for my place			0
this was @entity6 after all			0
’ @entity7 challenges @entity115 's @entity114 in a @entity117 qualifier at @entity118 in 2012 the @entity0 squad brave the freezing temperatures in @entity121 on monday night in training manager @entity12 says the empty stadium for the @entity34 match will not benefit @entity0			2
