@entity0 has blasted @entity1 for being too slow to inform it about three @entity4 schoolgirls who travelled to @entity0 last week possibly en route to join @entity7 militants in @entity8			1
yesterday , @entity9 announced all teenagers boarding flights to @entity0 could be challenged by airlines about whether they plan to join @entity13 under new plans			1
the prime minister told mps that talks were being held with airlines to alert the police to ensure that ' at risk children are properly identified and questioned '			1
prime minister @entity9 told mps that talks were being held with airlines to alert the police to ensure that ' at risk children are properly identified and questioned ' it came after three @entity4 schoolgirls who are feared to have fled @entity1 to join @entity13 , boarding a flight to @entity0 before slipping into neighbouring @entity8			1
@entity0 's deputy prime minister @entity26 said he hoped the girls would be found , but that it would be @entity1 , not @entity0 , to blame if they were not			1
' it is an condemnable act for @entity1 to let three girls ... come to @entity33 and then let us know three days later			1
' they have n't taken the necessary measures , ' he said			0
the three @entity4 schoolgirls arrived at @entity37 on february 17 and @entity1 authorities , concerned that they were travelling to join @entity40 fighters , informed @entity41 on february 20 , @entity26 said			1
@entity0 was able to do little to track the movements of three people who had entered as tourists , he said			1
lured to jihad : @entity46 , 16 , left , @entity47 , 15 , centre , and @entity49 , 15 , right , at @entity50 ' the search is ongoing			1
it would be great if we can find them			0
but if we ca n't , it is not us who will be responsible , but the @entity1			2
' thousands of foreigners from more than 80 countries have joined the ranks of @entity40 and other radical groups in @entity8 and @entity61 , many crossing through @entity0			2
@entity0 has said it needs more detailed and faster information from @entity64 intelligence agencies to intercept them			2
yesterday , it emerged that police spoke to @entity46 , 16 , @entity49 , 15 , and @entity47 , 15 , just months before they disappeared and found ' no evidence ' that they had been radicalised officers were deployed to the school as part of counter-terrorism and anti-radicalisation measures after another teenage girl from @entity74 in east @entity4 fled to join @entity13			2
mr @entity9 said that measures are in place to stop people with known terror links from travelling , but the latest case of the three girls highlighted problems with unaccompanied teenagers who are not on watch lists			1
in a @entity85 statement , mr @entity9 stressed that stopping travel to join @entity13 in @entity61 and @entity8 is ' vital '			2
he told @entity87 : ' when people are known risks , whatever their age , they go on our @entity91 and we can intervene to prevent travel and seize their passports			0
' but what this incident has highlighted is the concerning situation where unaccompanied teenagers like these - who are not a known risk - can board a flight to @entity0 without necessarily being asked questions by the airline			1
' we need new proportionate arrangements with airlines to ensure that these at risk children are properly identified and questioned			0
flight to terror : clutching their luggage , the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to @entity33 ' whenever there are concerns , police at the border should be alerted so they can use the new temporary passport seizure powers to stop people travelling			0
' he revealed home secretary @entity118 and transport secretary @entity119 will be working with the airlines to bring this about			0
it follows concern about differences between airlines on the rules governing children travelling alone on flights			0
the latest schoolgirls to go missing are feared to have fled to @entity8 to become @entity131 brides after being ruthlessly groomed online and ' brainwashed in their bedrooms '			1
they walked out of their homes last tuesday before strolling through security checks at @entity50 and flying to @entity0			1
police fear their goal is to reach the terror stronghold of @entity139 where they face being married off to foreign fighters			0
' groomed ' : @entity47 ( right ) is thought to have been contacted directly using @entity142 by a female is fighter			2
she later flew from @entity50 to @entity0 with friends @entity46 , left , 16 , and @entity49 mr @entity9 said : ' all of us have been horrified by the way that @entity1 teenagers appear to have been radicalised and duped by this poisonous ideology of @entity7 extremism while at home on the internet in their bedrooms			1
' they appear to have been induced to join a terrorist group that carries out the most hideous violence and believes girls should be married at nine and women should not leave the home			0
' @entity74 headteacher @entity158 ( pictured ) said there was no evidence that the girls had been radicalised at the school police spoke to the three @entity1 ' jihadi brides ' just months before they disappeared and found ' no evidence ' that they had been radicalised , it emerged today			1
@entity158 , the headteacher of @entity74 in east @entity4 - which @entity46 , 16 , @entity49 , 15 , and @entity47 , 15 , all attended - revealed that police had spoken to the girls last year			2
despite fears that the girls were groomed online , mr @entity158 issued a statement today in which he insisted the trio were not radicalised at school			0
he said access to @entity142 and @entity175 through school computers was ' strictly regulated '			2
mr @entity158 said : ' with such measures in place , police have advised us that there is no evidence that radicalisation of the students took place at the academy			0
' from the increasing number of similar news reports around the world , it 's clear that this is an international issue that is increasing in severity and it is affecting schools across the country and beyond			0
' we are constantly reviewing our safeguarding procedures			0
' @entity47 , who is thought to be travelling on her sister 's passport , was ' following ' more than 70 known extremists on @entity142 â€“ many of them thought to be @entity13 fighters			1
at least one of the girls is also thought to have been contacted directly using @entity142 by a female @entity13 fighter			1
however , despite these accounts being well known , none have been suspended by @entity142 bosses			2
mr @entity9 said it highlighted the need for social media companies to do more to help the police and security agencies			1
he called for greater co-operation over contacts between extremists and those who could be radicalised			0
' internet companies have a social responsibility			1
and we expect them to live up to it , ' the @entity220 said			2
the @entity1 government is also stepping up pressure for an @entity227 - wide deal on sharing flight passenger records to track potential jihadists			1
it would provide the names of passengers , and details of how tickets were bought and the bank accounts used and who people are travelling with			0
mr @entity9 said it would offer ' vital information to help us identify in advance when people are travelling on high risk routes '			0
he raised the issue with @entity0 prime minister @entity245 in december			1
however , the @entity247 directive has stalled in @entity248 after a row about human rights			0
in the wake of the terror attacks in @entity253 and @entity254 , a meeting of the @entity256 last week agreed that @entity257 should urgently adopt a ' strong and effective ' @entity247 directive			0
mr @entity9 stressed that tackling the problem was not just an issue for our police and border controls			0
' we do need schools and universities and colleges to put aside concerns about cultural sensitivity or suchlike and really make sure they are doing everything they can to tackle people at risk of radicalisation			0
' it is quite similar in some ways to the problem of forced marriage where we have had people disappearing from schools in parts of the country without there being proper ... protection in those schools			0
' indeed it is quite similar to the problem of @entity288 , but it is on an enormous scale and that is why we need to take such action			0

@entity0 's deputy prime minister said he hoped the girls would be found
but he added that it would be @entity1 , not @entity0 , to blame if they were not
