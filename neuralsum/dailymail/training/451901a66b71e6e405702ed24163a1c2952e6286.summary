by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:38 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 25 october 2013 @entity3 today became the latest firm to announce eye - watering price rises , warning bills will go up by 9 per cent within weeks			1
the firm , fined last week for mis - selling , claimed it could ' understand that these are difficult times for many families ' but blamed rising wholesale prices and the government 's ' social and environmental schemes '			0
it came as it emerged @entity15 ’s plans to ‘ roll back ’ the green levies on energy bills could see the costs passed on to the taxpayer			1
hike : @entity3 became the latest firm to announce plans to increase bills by up to 9 per cent row : prime minster @entity15 stunned the @entity22 with his pledge to ' roll back ' green levies on energy bills but deputy prime minister @entity26 has refused to scrap help for elderly people @entity3 said that from december 6 domestic dual fuel prices would rise by an average of 8.6 per cent , adding £ 113 on the average bill			1
domestic gas prices will rise by an average of 8.5 per cent and electricity prices by 9 per cent			0
in a statement the firm said : ' we understand that these are difficult times for many families and we have done all that we can to hold prices for as long as possible			0
' however , following rises in wholesale energy costs , increased charges to deliver energy to your home and increased costs to support compulsory social and environmental schemes , @entity3 is to increase domestic dual fuel prices by an average of 8.6 % from 6th december 2013			1
' it comes after the firm was ordered to pay £ 8.5million compensation to customers after an investigation by the industry regulator found they had mis - sold gas and electricity			0
households were given misleading estimates of how much they would pay for energy if they switched their supplier , @entity58 found			2
@entity67 - owned supplier @entity65 has said it will increase charges by 10.4 per cent to an average of £ 1,491 per year			1
and @entity71 has announced a 9.2 per cent rise and @entity73 an 8.2 per cent hike			1
@entity75 , director of consumer policy at @entity76 , said : ' unfortunately , the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession			2
' the danger is that these hikes are sweeping households towards a cliff edge – when bills hit £ 1,500 a year this will be the tipping point where many will have no choice but to go without heating			0
this will have a serious impact on health and well - being			0
' the huge increases have increased pressure on the government to act against the power firms which continue to make substantial profits			1
energy secretary @entity101 said : ' with fifteen independent energy suppliers to choose from outside the @entity104 , it ’s surprising that these companies think they can keep getting away with bill hikes of this magnitude			2
' as more and more people shop around for the competitive deals on the market , some of which are offered by the independents , companies like @entity3 can no longer put their bills up in this way with no consequences			0
' mr @entity15 sparked a furious coalition row yesterday with his promise to cut green levies added to bills , with the @entity22 accusing him of making ‘ panicky ’ new energy policy ‘ on the hoof ’			1
today deputy prime minister @entity26 made clear he would not allow funds which help the elderly to stay warm to be scrapped , but could be paid through taxes instead of through energy bills			1
labour leader @entity128 has vowed to freeze bills for 20 years if he wins the next election , while former @entity132 prime minister sir @entity131 this week called for a windfall tax on energy firms to help people stay warm this winter			1
but during a fraught prime minister ’s questions mr @entity15 rejected both ideas , insisting : ' we need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges			1
’ the surprise move caught the @entity22 off guard , with mr @entity26 only told about the policy change half an hour before it was made public			1
crisis : the latest run of price hikes by the energy firms has increased pressure on the government to help families struggling to pay the bills @entity15 has ' lost control ' of the government 's energy policy , @entity128 claimed today			1
the @entity155 leader accused the prime minister of making up policy without taking on the @entity159 energy firms			1
mr @entity128 said in a speech to the @entity161 : ' yesterday was the day @entity15 lost control of his government			1
' in weakness and panic , he made up a policy on energy , which means business as usual for the energy companies , and which is already falling apart			2
' there is no solution to the cost of living crisis which tiptoes around taking on the energy companies and reforming a broken market			2
' but this prime minister is too weak to stand up for the consumer and he always takes the side of the @entity159 companies			1
' mr @entity26 and mr @entity15 are expected to discuss the fall - out of the row at the weekend			2
but mr @entity26 today proposed funds raised on bills to pay for help for the elderly could instead be paid for from general taxation			1
he told @entity186 : ‘ we could perhaps fund that through general government expenditure but one way or the other these levies we do need to help those 2 million families with their fuel bills			2
‘ i do not want to turn our backs on the poorest in society			0
i do n't want to turn our back on the environment			0
’ he added : ‘ all i care about is the objectives remain clear and stable , helping the fuel poor , keeping the lights on , getting homes insulated and supporting our green economy			0
’ in particular mr @entity26 is understood to be determined to protect the @entity203 , which pays £ 135 to the over- 75s and poorest pensioners to help with their fuel bill			2
it adds around £ 11 to the average dual - fuel energy bill , and would cost around £ 270million to fund from taxation			1
a senior @entity22 source said : ‘ you can put this stuff on people ’s bills or you can fund it through general taxation but somebody has got to pay for it			1
’ the @entity217 , which adds £ 47 to bills , is used for home improvements but is not restricted to the poorest households			0
it only came into force earlier this year			0
energy secretary @entity101 is already concerned that the @entity159 energy firms are not using the fund properly and it could be ‘ tweaked ’			2
mr @entity101 added : ' the government is looking at how to get people ’s energy bills as low as possible to help hard - pressed households			0
' we ’ve already increased competition , brought new players in to the market to offer consumers real choice , and the most vulnerable people are getting direct help with their bills this winter			0
we ’ll continue this work to make sure consumers are getting a good deal			0
' energy firm bosses have been called to @entity242 to explain the dramatic rises at a time when families are struggling , with living costs rising at twice the rate of wages			1
@entity250 sources said that , if there was no policy change , green levies could rise from the current £ 112 to £ 194 - or 14 per cent of the typical household bill - by 2020			2
but @entity255 seemed unaware of sir @entity131 ’s dramatic intervention into the debate on bills , when he called for a windfall tax			0
sir @entity131 said : ‘ i predict this winter – sod ’s law being what it is - that we will probably have a very cold winter and it is not acceptable to me and ought not to be acceptable to anyone that many people are going to have to choose between keeping warm and eating			0
‘ that is not acceptable			0
and so if we get this cold spell , the government i think will have to intervene			0
‘ and if they do intervene and it is costly i for one would regard it as perfectly acceptable for them then subsequently to levy an excess profits tax on the energy companies and claw that money back to the exchequer where the primary job is to get the economy working and people back to work			0

latest hike comes after @entity71 , @entity65 and @entity73 *unveiled* rises
prime minister stunned @entity22 with plan to cut cost of green policies
@entity26 insists he will not allow help for the elderly to be scrapped
instead costs could be shifted from power firms to general taxation
@entity128 claims the @entity289 has ' lost control ' of his energy policy
