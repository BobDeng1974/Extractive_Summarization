@entity0 has revealed how @entity1 tore into his @entity3 players in @entity4 and admits a repeat of the performance will result in disappointment at @entity8			1
@entity1 was furious with what he saw during a goalless first 45 minutes in the @entity10 against @entity11			1
he hauled off @entity12 and @entity13 during the break and accused his team of being ' very slow ' and lacking ' intensity ' and ' creativity '			1
' he was not happy and at half - time he showed it , ' said @entity0			1
' he told us exactly what he wanted in the second - half			1
we tried to play more offensive			0
he wanted to win the game and we tried to do that			0
@entity1 was left fuming after @entity3 's ' slow ' first - half performance in @entity11 on wednesday @entity0 ( second right ) , seen high - fiving @entity27 after his equalising goal , revealed @entity1 tore into his players during his half - time team talk @entity27 equalised for @entity3 after 73 minutes but they were unable to push on and win the match in @entity4 ' for us , it was a massive game			1
it was very important and we did n’t win			0
we know how our performance has to be to get the points			0
if we play like that against @entity8 , we know it ’s not possible to win			0
' @entity11 took the lead early in the second half through @entity44 before @entity27 equalised and @entity3 summoned a desperate finish			1
@entity46 missed a penalty five minutes from time and @entity49 had a goal ruled out for offside			1
@entity1 was convinced it was onside and was criticised @entity55 referee @entity54 , but @entity0 said : ' we did n’t perform how we know			1
in the end , with the penalty , we should have won			0
to be honest , maybe we did n’t deserve to win			0
@entity1 was not impressed by @entity3 's poor start to the game and let his players know at half - time @entity1 - and @entity63 - were not impressed by referee @entity54 ' we did n’t have enough stability in our game			1
when we conceded the game changed and we changed the shape , playing three at the back with more risk and we scored a goal			2
' when you change the shape , you always have the risk of conceding a goal and that ’s why in the second half we did n’t look how we normally do			2
we can not be relaxed and we have to learn from every game			0
' every time when we come into the game relaxed and not play for 90 minutes we are struggling with results			2
so we have to be smart in that part and we have to play every game , 90 minutes			0
' @entity3 are still strong favourites to qualify from @entity85 @entity49 had a late goal ruled out for offside as @entity3 pushed forward in search of a winner despite dropping points , @entity3 are in a healthy position			1
they are top of the @entity92 and travel to @entity8 on saturday			0
they are in the last eight of the @entity94 and are three points clear at the top of their @entity10 group			0
a win away against @entity101 ’s @entity100 next time out in @entity102 will secure a place in the last 16 with a game to spare , and they complete the group stage at home to @entity107			2
' we should have finished the group in @entity11 , ' added @entity0			2
' but now it ’s too late and we have to think about the next game in the @entity10			2
we will have the opportunity at home to kill it off			0
