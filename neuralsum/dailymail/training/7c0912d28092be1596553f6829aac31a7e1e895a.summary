serious delays over the release by an @entity3 court of the full findings of @entity7 owner @entity6 's conviction for tax evasion have been criticised by the @entity9 for continuing to cast a shadow over the club			1
@entity6 was found guilty of a tax evasion offence back in march and the @entity9 tried to have the @entity3 businessman barred from taking over the club but he won an arbitration appeal on the grounds that the offence was not one of dishonesty			1
the appeal was only granted on condition , that the full written reasons of the @entity3 court case did not rule it a dishonest act			1
those findings were expected in june but have still yet to materialise			2
delay : court findings of @entity7 owner @entity6 's tax evasion case were meant to be released in june @entity9 chief executive @entity32 , speaking to reporters at the @entity30 conference in @entity31 , said : ' it 's exceptionally disappointing that we have n't actually had the judgement , if not only to draw a line under the whole scenario so that everyone knows where they are			1
' it 's a cloud still hanging over both the @entity9 and the club , and mr @entity6 himself			1
' we are constantly monitoring it			0
we have been asked to be kept informed			0
our influence over the judicial system in @entity3 is somewhat limited			2
' we have @entity3 lawyers monitoring it for us and we 've been told it will come out when it comes out			0
that 's how the @entity3 judicial system has been described to us			2
' @entity32 said if the case was judged to be one of dishonesty @entity55 would have to sell his majority shareholding and cease being a director of @entity7			0
he added : ' from our perspective he then fails the owners and directors ' test and at that stage the provisions are in the rules that he has to divest himself of his interests			0
cloud : according to @entity9 chief executive @entity32 ' it 's a cloud still hanging over the club ' ' we 'd obviously give the club a reasonable period of time to organise its affairs because you would n't want to put the future of the club at risk immediately that you had a decision			1
it 's a matter the @entity9 board would have to consider at that particular time			2
' @entity32 also explained why the league had initially tried to bar @entity55			0
he said : ' the @entity9 felt that the current court case in @entity3 constituted a dishonest act and as such should have barred him from being able to own the club			1
as is his right , he appealed and the appeal found that we did n't have the ability to say that			0
' the actual single arbiter in the matter made it very clear that when the written reasons are issued as part of the judicial process , if it is clear in there that the act was one of dishonesty , which is the test that we apply , then at that stage he would fail the owners and directors ' test and as such would n't be able to be a director of the football club or exert any control			0
' mixed reception : @entity6 has already sacked two managers at @entity7 and has divided supporters at the club			1
