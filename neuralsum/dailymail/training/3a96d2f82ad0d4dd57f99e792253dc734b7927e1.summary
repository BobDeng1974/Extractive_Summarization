a day after the @entity2 ’s £ 5.136billion tv deal raised the stakes , @entity0 decided they could not afford the possibility of relegation			1
@entity0 finally sacked beleaguered manager @entity6 on wednesday night after slipping into the drop zone following their dismal 2 - 0 defeat at @entity9 on tuesday night			1
when there is even more money for the clubs at @entity17 football ’s top table , decisions like that become a whole lot easier			0
@entity0 have sacked manager @entity6 after their woeful @entity2 form goals - 12 - ranked 20th in the @entity2 chances created - 188 - 19th shots - 186 - 19th conversion rate - 6 per cent - 20th shots on target - 67 - 20th shooting accuracy - 36 per cent - 20th the 45 - year - old ’s final game in charge was @entity0 ’s 10th @entity2 match without a win and came after more supporter protests			1
fans have wanted him out for weeks , frustrated by a lack of points , goals and style			0
the trip to @entity9 was their 15th league match of the season without scoring			1
@entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 — considered three of the better players — were left on the bench			0
@entity0 supporters unveiled a ‘ @entity49 ’ banner			1
his departure came on the day the @entity51 called for @entity0 to immediately axe the @entity52 with a piece entitled : ‘ @entity51 says : @entity6 must go ! ’ but it comes a fortnight after @entity0 chief executive @entity56 insisted they would not bow to fan pressure			1
@entity58 and @entity59 are two of the early contenders to take over			0
the @entity51 called for @entity6 's sacking with this hard - hitting message @entity6 with @entity63 during @entity0 's latest defeat , a 2 - 0 reverse at @entity9 on tuesday @entity42 ( right ) shows the strain during the @entity9 defeat as the club dropped into the relegation zone a statement on the club ’s website read : ‘ @entity0 has parted company with manager @entity6			1
first - team coach @entity75 and goalkeeping coach @entity76 will continue to prepare the squad for sunday ’s @entity78 tie with @entity79 at @entity80			1
’ the players are believed to have been left out of the loop over the sacking and found out via television and social media			0
most of them have relegation clauses in their contracts for wage cuts of between 30 and 50 per cent in the event of relegation , so the club are sure to expect an immediate reaction to the change at the helm			2
in the short - term , goalkeeping coach @entity76 , who has been increasingly vocal in training of late , is likely to play a big role in trying to rally the squad			1
@entity6 ’s @entity2 record with @entity0 is woeful			1
their 12 goals scored , six per cent shot conversion rate , 67 shots on target and 36 per cent shooting accuracy ranks them worst in the top flight			0
@entity0 supporters unveiled a ' @entity6 out ' banner at the @entity110 with feeling mounting against the boss that led to the @entity51 campaign , which urged : ‘ @entity0 is a proud and noble name in @entity17 football			1
it is an historic club at the heart of our community , a founding father of the beautiful game			0
but this great club is now on its knees and the @entity80 is hurting — and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen			0
‘ today the @entity51 makes one simple , stark request to the board : sack the manager			2
’ former @entity0 striker @entity130 also called for change on talksport , saying : ‘ i really worry for my old club			1
i am not one for seeing people lose their jobs , but sometimes change is necessary			0
it is all right to say ‘ ‘ our business plan is that we do n’t sack people mid-season ’ ’ , but if that ’s the case you might be playing in a different league next year			0
’ chief executive @entity56 had previously insisted it would be wrong for him and owner @entity146 to sack @entity6 , which would be a gamble no different to ‘ flipping a coin ’			1
a place in the bottom three brought a swift change of heart			0
@entity151 , who scored @entity0 ’s @entity153 winner in 1982 , said on wednesday night : ‘ the most important thing is to get someone in who is right until the end of season ; someone with a feeling for the club , who can bring the fans back and inspire them			1
’ @entity0 is a proud and noble name in @entity17 football			1
it is an historic club at the heart of our community , a founding father of the beautiful game			0
but this great club is now on its knees and the @entity80 is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen			0
today the @entity51 makes one simple , stark request to the @entity0 board : sack the manager			1
@entity6 is not the man to save this club from relegation and the long - term damage that disaster will bring			1
we do not say this lightly , nor do we take any pleasure in saying that @entity6 should go			1
the @entity51 has been as patient as many of the claret and blue fans , standing by and hoping things will improve			0
despite the results , despite the performances			0
but time is now up			0
no progress has been made under @entity6			1
in fact , this once mighty club is now staring relegation in the face			2
a relegation that would cost the club a lucrative share of the new £ 2 billion @entity200 and @entity201 television deal			2
dropping down a division would be a disaster financially , and one from which @entity0 may never recover			2
as custodian of the club , @entity146 must ensure it does n’t happen			0
@entity6 has presided over just two @entity2 victories in 20 matches since agreeing a bumper new four - year deal in mid-september			2
the poor , and too often dull , performances mean the team is last on @entity214 nearly every week - and at this rate destined for an even later saturday night slot on the @entity217 show next season			2
that ’s why @entity0 must act now - before it ’s too late			2
awful football , declining attendances , and post-match excuses that beggar belief			0
@entity0 should not be aiming to survive - they should be aiming to strive , to compete in the higher reaches of the league			2
long - ball football has been replaced by an equally unsuccessful possession - based style of play			0
now the manager says his side must play ugly football to get themselves clear of relegation - and they will , he says			1
we do n’t believe @entity6 anymore			2
he is out of ideas , there is nothing left for him to say to his players that he has n’t said already			0
we respect his integrity and loyalty , but the fans do n’t want him			0
