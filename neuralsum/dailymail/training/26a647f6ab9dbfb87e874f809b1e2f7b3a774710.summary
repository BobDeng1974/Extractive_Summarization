by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 3 december 2013 there 's something rotten in @entity4 country and it means some farmers are looking overseas for a solution			2
@entity8 root rot , caused by a waterborne mould , is an issue with fir producers nationwide			1
@entity12 trudged up the steep slope and stopped at a desiccated , rust - brown tree			1
two months earlier , workers had tagged this @entity17 fir as ready for market			2
it was going to be someone 's christmas tree			1
and now it was dead			2
he 's been growing @entity17 fir for 40 years , but a root - rotting mold has him looking to the @entity25 species to help save his family farm finding the cure : while researchers try to unlock the genetic code to root rot , some farmers are trying @entity25 fir as an alternative			1
fraser fir farmer @entity12 sold his first @entity25 trees last year , and his customers raved ' never get paid back for this tree , ' he said with a shrug			1
' eleven years of work — gone			0
' the culprit : @entity8 root rot , a water mold that , once in the soil , makes it unfit for production			1
@entity12 has been growing @entity17 in these western @entity53 mountains for nearly 40 years			0
to him , it 's ' the ultimate tree			1
' but this persistent problem has him looking to a species from the birthplace of old @entity58 himself for a possible alternative			2
and he 's not alone			0
growers in @entity61 , the nation 's no. 1 christmas tree producer , have been experimenting with the @entity25 fir for more than 30 years			1
that species and the @entity66 , also native to @entity67 , have shown promising resistance to root rot			1
' @entity8 is a problem in most areas where true firs ... are grown , ' said @entity73 , a plant pathologist and extension specialist at @entity75			1
' it 's a national problem			0
' looking abroad : root rot is threatening traditional @entity79 fir trees , and growers are scrambling to find a solution this year			1
@entity8 root rot , caused by a waterborne mold , is an issue with fir producers nationwide @entity61 leads the nation in christmas tree production , with nearly 7 million harvested in 2007 , the latest figures available from the @entity89			1
@entity53 was a distant second , with around 3.1 million trees cut			0
one study estimated the potential losses to @entity61 's nursery and christmas tree industries of up to $ 304 million a year if @entity8 is not properly contained			1
@entity96 and @entity97 are the dominant holiday tree species in the @entity99			1
in @entity53 , the no. 2 producer , it costs farmers up to $ 6 million a year , said @entity103 , a @entity79 tree geneticist at @entity105 in @entity106			1
to date , no fungicide has proven effective to control @entity8 on christmas tree plantations			1
so once it 's in the soil , that 's it			0
@entity12 , who grows about 130,000 trees on several western @entity53 farms , said @entity8 set in after @entity114 in 1996 and got worse following 2004 's @entity115			1
he 's lost about a quarter of his trees over the past six seasons , and the state rated the mortality on some of his stands at up to 80 percent			0
' they 'll be good for growing grass , ' he said as he stood overlooking several barren hilltop fields recently			0
researchers at @entity75 and several other universities are hoping to unlock the secrets to some species ' rot resistance			1
rotting : once root rot gets into the soil , the water mold makes it impossible to grow healthy trees like the @entity17 fir , which along with the @entity96 and @entity135 is one of the most classic @entity79 trees in a greenhouse on the campus of @entity105 , master 's student @entity138 looked over rows of fir seedlings that had been inoculated with @entity8			1
he 's looking for genes related to disease resistance in @entity25 fir			0
' and if we can identify the gene , maybe we can go out and ... possibly we can speed up the hybridization and get something to the growers faster , ' he said			2
but what works in @entity53 might not necessarily help in the @entity99 , where other species of @entity8 are more common , said @entity73			1
@entity153 , a ph.d. candidate in @entity73 's lab , is working under a @entity157 @entity156 grant to create a nationwide collection of @entity159 from @entity79 trees to understand regional variation in pathogen populations			1
the goal is to challenge various firs with different @entity159 to determine mechanisms of resistance and ultimately develop genetic markers that can be used to identify trees that are resistant to the disease , @entity73 said			2
but until native trees can be modified to have greater resistance , @entity12 and others are looking toward these other species			2
since 2004 , @entity61 growers have planted an average of 500,000 @entity177 and @entity25 firs per year , with similar activity in western @entity179 and the @entity180 , said @entity73			2
a three - year project by @entity182 to identify superior sources of @entity177 and @entity25 fir has resulted in the development of seed orchards for those species			2
trials : christmas tree geneticist @entity103 and student @entity138 inspect infected fir seedlings			2
researchers are looking for the gene that lends rot resistance to some fir species in hopes of helping @entity79 tree farmers stem losses @entity12 planted his first seedlings about six years ago and sold his first trees last year			1
he said his customers were ' tickled to death			0
' ' we followed them all the way through , from when they put them up to when they took them down , ' said @entity12			0
' and they were happy and so now we 're sure of the tree			2
' of course , the @entity25 fir is far from bulletproof			0
it tends to bud out earlier than @entity17 fir , making it vulnerable to late - season frosts			0
and deer find it irresistible			0
' they 'll walk by @entity17 to snack on the @entity25 fir , ' @entity103 said with a chuckle			0
after the success of his first sales , @entity12 ordered enough @entity25 fir seedlings from @entity61 for a full rotation			0
he expects to plant them this spring			0
@entity226 ' the season : growers in @entity61 ¿ the biggest producer of @entity79 trees ¿ and @entity53 , among other places , are looking to different species that are resistant to the root rot on a recent sunny afternoon , @entity12 stood on a hillside as seasonal workers cut , baled and stacked trees — some of which he 's waited 17 years to harvest			1
looking down , his hands were stained with fragrant sap			0
' that sap , it kind of runs in your blood , ' he said			0
' these @entity17 fir are to the mountain people what the buffalo was to the @entity247			0
... these @entity79 trees have kept family farms in families			1
and we 're very thankful for them			0
' @entity12 's two sons , @entity253 and @entity12 , have joined him in the business			0
at 61 , he knows he has to prepare for the future			0
' when we plant something , we 're not thinking about one president away or two presidents			0
sometimes it 's three and four presidents down the road , ' he said			0
' i 'm banking on this tree to keep me in the christmas tree farming business			2

@entity8 root rot is a *stubborn* enemy for some @entity79 tree growers
no fungicide has proved effective to control @entity8
growers turning to species from @entity274 , @entity275 that are more resistant
