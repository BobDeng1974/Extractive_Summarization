@entity1 manager @entity0 believes a @entity2 semi-final against @entity4 has given the @entity6 club the perfect opportunity to finally leave their part in the @entity10 saga behind them			1
@entity0 has turned his club into the modern day giantkillers to be feared by all others over the last couple of years , with last year ’s run to the semi-final of the @entity18 meaning that they have only lost once in their last 17 cup games			1
as incredible as that is , @entity1 are unfortunately still tainted a little by their attempts to sign convicted rapist @entity10 on his release from prison last year			1
that move was eventually scrapped after pressure from outside and indeed their own sponsors and now @entity0 hopes they can move on			1
@entity1 discussed re-signing convicted rapist @entity10 ( right ) , pictured with girlfriend @entity31 @entity10 played for @entity1 before being jailed for five years for rape , of which he served two - and - a - half the former @entity34 striker was pictured leaving a gym in @entity36 last week @entity37 ( centre ) celebrates scoring against @entity39 in the @entity18 @entity41 players looked dejected after they conceded against @entity1 in the @entity2 ‘ that ’s good and it is always nice when there are more positive headlines , with stories focused on what is happening on the pitch , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ every football club wants to be talked about because of what it does on the pitch rather than off it and this gives us another opportunity to be discussed in a good light			2
’ certainly @entity0 and his players deserve some positive @entity59 season ’s @entity18 efforts saw them beat @entity60 and @entity61 before they lost to @entity62 at @entity63			2
this season , meanwhile , they have knocked @entity39 out of that competition and overcame @entity67 at home in the last round of this one			0
@entity0 , manager of @entity1 , has already beaten @entity73 outfit twice in the competition players celebrate after @entity76 scores the winning penalty in a shoot - out against @entity41 @entity79 ( right ) scores @entity1 's winning goal against @entity67 in the quarter - finals @entity0 is modest enough to suggest some of his team ’s success has its roots in good fortune			1
the statistics do n’t lie , though , and undoubtedly the @entity1 manager ’s policy of routinely fielding strong teams in cup ties has paid off			2
on wednesday night he merely hopes his team can get out of @entity93 without a hiding			1
if they are still in touch with @entity4 before next week ’s second leg in @entity100 then logic and recent history suggests they will have a great chance			2
asked if @entity4 may be under some pressure on wednesday night , @entity0 said : ‘ certainly in the home leg , yes			1
we have that same feeling week in and week out in @entity6			2
@entity4 boss @entity105 and his side must be wary of @entity1 @entity107 of @entity1 celebrates with his team - mate after scoring against @entity109 ‘ at @entity111 , people expect us to roll teams over but for the opposition it is one of their biggest games of the season			1
‘ hopefully , the roles will be reversed on wednesday but without doubt they have the quality to hurt you , even if we play to our absolute maximum			0
‘ if @entity124 is on song , @entity126 and people like that , they have the quality to hurt any team in @entity131			0
@entity1 players celebrate dumping @entity73 high - flyers @entity67 out of the @entity2 ‘ but we do n’t fear it			1
we are aware of how good they are but we do n’t go into too much detail otherwise we would shaking before we even get on to the pitch			0
‘ i ’m not sure @entity4 will be too worried , looking at them in the last few weeks			0
i do n’t think they ’ll be too concerned but i think they ’ll be more aware of us			0
‘ if you get results in the cup competitions i think the opposition does become a little bit more aware , and cautious we hope , but with what they ’ve got to put on the pitch they ’ll back themselves			0
‘ we ’ve got to try and stay in the tie for the second leg			0
that ’s the main thing			0
’ @entity67 players look distraught after conceding against @entity1 in the quarter - final			0
