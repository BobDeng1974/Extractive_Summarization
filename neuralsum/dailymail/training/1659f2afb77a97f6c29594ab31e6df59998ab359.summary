by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 09:56 est , 8 january 2013 a plane enthusiast restored the cockpit of a @entity4 fighter jet and proudly parked it on his driveway			1
@entity7 , 37 , renovated the nose of the battered @entity10 jet for display in front of his family home in @entity15 , @entity16			1
he says his wife @entity17 and children @entity19 , two , and @entity20 , 18 months , have now grown ' attached ' to the piece of history sitting in their driveway			2
it was the first single jet engine fighter produced in the @entity39 and some 3,200 were made			1
mr @entity7 bought the wrecked cockpit for £ 1,500 at an auction at @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44			1
his plan was met with scepticism from his friends , family and neighbours - but the impressive restoration has made his driveway a popular attraction			2
magnificent machine : a @entity54 from the @entity39 @entity55 soars through the sky ' it 's just a complete transformation , ' said mr @entity7 , an electronics engineer at @entity61 's @entity60 hospital			2
' i 've got loads of compliments and because we live right next to the @entity66 you can see people looking down on it			2
the @entity10 was the first single jet engine fighter produced in the @entity39			1
it was designed in 1941 and the first prototype was taken on its maiden flight by @entity73 on september 20 , 1943 , but its on - going development meant it did not see active service in @entity37			0
the first production @entity77 first flew in april 1945			0
it was small and light because of the low power of early jet engines - its ' @entity83 ' engine giving just 2100lbs of thrust			1
around 3,200 @entity85 were made and the @entity10 , a two seat side - by - side trainer version , was the final version produced			1
' the neighbours love it - the ones next door have have been showing a lot of interest , saying , " wow , what a difference " and that they did n't think it would happen			0
' i 've become best buddies with a guy across the road because of it			0
it 's strange but i think it has made everyone a lot closer			0
' the cockpit was used as a gateway display at the museum in @entity109 before it was moved to @entity111 museum 14 years ago			1
mr @entity7 , who already owned a @entity112 , said : ' there was a lot more involved than i first thought			0
' luckily a firm called @entity116 offered to do all the donkey work			0
' that was a great help so a big thank you is needed for them			0
' he took the cockpit to @entity123 , where it was a huge hit			1
' the response was unbelievable , ' he said			0
' there were people in and out all day long			0
' he now intends to add to his collection of aircraft with a full - size mock - up of a @entity133 cockpit , which will be made into a flight simulator			2
but with his driveway now full , he is running out of places to put the simulator , and is appealing to anyone with available space in the area to come forward			0
landmark : mr @entity7 's drive has become a tourist attraction since he placed the restored cockpit there , after buying it for £ 1,500 at an auction at @entity42 and @entity43			1
