by @entity0 , @entity1 deputy political editor @entity2 ripped off the gloves and came out swinging in last night ’s debate – landing crucial blows on the @entity6 , @entity8 oil and most - important of all : the pound			1
the first minister had been left reeling by @entity13 ’s questions over currency in the first debate earlier this month			2
but mr @entity2 left nothing to chance last night – setting out ‘ three plan bs for the price of one ’ while lambasting the ' no ' campaign 's negativity			1
here @entity1 recaps the four crucial moments from last night 's second and final live tv debate before the @entity26 poll			0
but won applause after reiterating his threat that if @entity43 stopped @entity34 sharing the pound , @entity42 would not take its fair share of the debt			2
crucially , he also wrong - footed the former @entity49 chancellor after finally admitting @entity34 could use alternative currencies to the pound			1
he ‘ set out the options to point out there are other things we could do ’ , highlighting a flexible currency union such as @entity57 and @entity58 's and the fixed exchange rate that @entity61 and @entity62 share			1
but mr @entity2 then added : ‘ we can not be stopped from using the pound anyway			1
’ the @entity65 leader claimed the biggest revelation from last night ’s debate was mr @entity13 ’s admission that @entity34 could use the pound if it wanted and there was nothing @entity43 could do about it			1
but mr @entity13 said this would leave @entity34 having to get its books signed off by @entity75 – much like @entity77 countries now have their accounts audited by @entity80			1
he said : ‘ of course we can use the pound ... we could use the rouble , we could use the dollar , we could use the yen			0
we could use anything we want			0
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ the key point we have heard tonight is that @entity13 admitted a few seconds ago we could use the pound anyway			1
we did n't need permission			0
‘ totally different from what the chancellor of the exchequer said a few months ago , when he said “ if you walk out of the @entity38 , you walk out of the pound ”			2
‘ remember that , we have heard it tonight			0
they can not stop us using the pound - the most important revelation of this debate			2
’ but closing the debate mr @entity13 insisted that uncertainty over currency could ‘ bring a country to its knees ’			1
the former chancellor said : ‘ i know there are some who are thinking about giving independence a chance , but when we ca n't be told about currency , i do n't think that can be trusted			0
’ mr @entity2 ( right ) managed to neutralise mr @entity13 's attacks on what currency an independent @entity34 would use during the televised debate mr @entity13 accused the pro-independence campaign of scaremongering on the future of the @entity6 with claims that a @entity118 vote is needed to protect the health service north of the border from privatisation under the @entity122			1
mr @entity13 said : ‘ what we need is less of that scaremongering and a realisation we all want the @entity6 to do well , we all want it to be there at the point of need , but to do that you need funding			2
' frankly taking on risks , not even knowing what currency you 've got , is the real threat to the @entity135			0
' but mr @entity2 landed crucial blows over the risk to @entity34 ’s public services of remaining in the @entity38 , which could be run from @entity75 by the @entity140 - dominated conservative party			1
he insisted that spending cuts south of the border could hurt the health service in @entity34 if the referendum resulted in a no vote he said : ‘ that is why , to have a health service we can all trust and rely on , we 've got to have a health service where we have financial control as well as policy control , so we can keep the @entity135 as the greatest public institution in @entity34			2
’ mr @entity2 also went on the attack over ‘ ludicrous ’ welfare cuts being pushed through in @entity43 , singling out the ‘ bedroom tax ’ for particular abuse			1
the @entity65 accused mr @entity13 of being ‘ in bed with the @entity168 ’ over welfare reforms - with this denied by the @entity161 leader , who argued that it made sense to spread the cost of providing social security across all of the @entity38			1
mr @entity13 said : ' we know there are people with disabilities , we know we 've got an ageing population that will require more medical care , we know we 've got a falling working age population			2
' why take that burden on five million people when it could be pooled and shared across 63 million ? it makes no sense whatsoever			0
’ but the first minister said 100,000 disabled people in @entity34 were being hit by the @entity38 @entity183 's welfare cuts			1
he acknowledged these were difficult times but ‘ you do n't take it out on the disabled , you do n't take it out on families with children ’			0
he also hit out at the ‘ bedroom tax ’ removal of the spare room subsidy for social tenants , calling it ‘ the most ludicrous tax of all time ’			0
mr @entity13 was left reeling by his @entity65 rival 's aggressive tactics the former @entity49 chancellor warned against being too reliant on @entity8 oil after independence - but was ridiculed by mr @entity2 who said countries like @entity58 were doing fine on their own			1
mr @entity13 said the @entity65 was wildly over-optimistic about how much oil was left in the @entity8 and said @entity34 was gambling on the ‘ volatile and uncertain ’ revenue from the fuel for around 15 per cent of its income			1
he added : ‘ once it 's gone , it 's gone			0
’ but mr @entity2 said @entity8 oil and gas ‘ will be with us way beyond 2050 ’			2
he said ‘ every other country in @entity213 would give their eye teeth ’ to have the resource			0
' the key point we have heard tonight is that @entity13 admitted a few seconds ago we could use the pound anyway			2
we did n't need permission			0
' ' this is our time , our moment , let 's seize it with both hands			0
' the bedroom tax ' must be the most ludicrous tax of all time '			0
' every other country in @entity213 would give their back teeth to have @entity230			0
' ' no - one will run this country better than the people who live and work in @entity34			0

*jumped* on @entity13 slip that @entity38 could not stop @entity34 using pound
mr @entity13 *repeated* claim from first debate that there is no currency @entity244
@entity246 became frustrated with the former chancellor 's focus on sterling
mr @entity2 *focussed* on threat of @entity34 being run by @entity122 in @entity75
he accused his @entity49 rival of being ' in bed ' with the conservatives
scored points attacking @entity168 cuts to health spending and welfare reforms
