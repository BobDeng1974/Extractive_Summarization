when the legal action was launched six years ago , he and three wealthy neighbours demanded damages for a decrease in the value of their homes			0
his lawsuit argues that the stall , which is extremely popular with skiers who buy chips there throughout the day , produces ' a very important olfactory nuisance due to the cooking and frying odours that rise up into their flats and on to their balconies '			1
what 's more , it adds , the stall spoils the ' view and exceptional tranquility ' of the apartment , as there are ' numerous chairs … multi-coloured parasols , dustbins and vehicles ' in front of it , the paper said			0
however , ms @entity28 's lawyer , @entity78 , retorted that multi-millionaire sir @entity43 , whose former company makes world - famous scents , is engaging in ' judicial harassment ' to protect nostrils accustomed only to inhaling fine aromas			2
during the trial he added : ' this is a lawsuit brought by rich people who live in silk and comfort , who only inhale perfume and who want to stop this lady from living			0
' lost cause : over the course of seven years of legal wranglings , @entity28 's lawyer argued that his client 's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman 's ' precious nostrils ' prestigious : @entity3 - the @entity103 resort where the chip shop is based - attracts a well - heeled crowd sir @entity43 was finally successful in having the chip shop closed today , having previously launched six other legal cases demanding that it cease operating responding to the decision , ms @entity28 told @entity110 : ' i do n’t know whether i will appeal the decision			1

i am financially and physically exhausted			2
' ' there ’s been seven rulings , and they lost the first six , but not the last one , ' she said , adding that the ruling has left her unemployed , although she confirmed that she has been given until the end of the current winter skiing system to wrap up the business			2
but she said that once the chip shop closes , it will be demolished within days			1
when the matter went to court in 2012 , ms @entity124 said : ' i 'm angry and i feel persecuted			0
for rich people , it 's certain that a chip stall in front of them is going to be annoying but us , we have to work for a living			2
' they complain about the noise and the smell of chips , but if you want peace and quiet , you do n't buy an apartment at the foot of the slopes			2
' when sir @entity43 took over @entity5 's in the mid- 1980s , annual sales were $ 3.7 billion , and when he stood down they were $ 14.5 billion			0
much of the success was based on brilliant marketing , including slogans like ' because you 're worth it '			0
as well as skiing , sir @entity43 , who is now 68 , is passionate about numerous sports including motor racing and sailing			0
he was knighted in 2005 .			0

sir @entity10 described the chip shop as an ' olfactory nuisance '
he *claimed* the ' nauseating smell ' of chips *devalued* his luxury ski lodge
added that it represented ' an abnormal disturbance ' to life in @entity3
now a @entity2 court has *upheld* his case and *ordered* the stall to close
owner @entity28 says she will be left unemployed by the decision but considers herself too ' financially exhausted ' to launch an appeal
