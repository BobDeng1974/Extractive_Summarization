@entity22 delivery : @entity8 at home with her baby , @entity19 , who was born in 48 minutes ' it was my first baby so the contractions were strong , ' mrs @entity8 said			1
' looking back i went from zero to ten in five minutes			1
' mrs @entity8 had to deliver @entity19 herself , with no pain relief , while her husband @entity29 frantically tried to reach @entity30 in @entity31			0
she said : ' i told @entity29 , " i think i 'm having this baby in the car " and he said , " you 're fine , just take deep breaths			1
we 'll get there "			0
' but it was too late			0
' at this time , the heads out and i 'm like " oh gosh let 's get moving " , ' mr @entity39 told @entity43			0

i was so scared that he was n't going to be ok			0
i did n't even think about the pain			0
' her unusual labor has not put the first - time mother off , however			2

although every pregnancy is different , labor usually lasts between 10 and 20 hours for a first - time mother			2
when a labor lasts three hours or less , it is known as precipitous or rapid labor			2

too late : by the time the couple reached @entity30 their baby had already been born @entity19 , who was born two weeks early , arrived so quickly that at first the couple 's family did not believe he had arrived in 48 minutes			1
' when i called my mom when we were in the hospital a couple of hours later and it was said and done she said , " no you 're lying , stop it			2
" and i finally had to tell her eight , or nine times that no , we had a baby in 48 minutes , ' mr @entity39 said			1
after @entity19 's dramatic entrance on may 13 , the couple are now looking forward to moving down a gear and getting to know their new son			0
@entity19 will also have a lasting reminder of his unusual entrance			0
on his birth certificate , under place of birth , it lists ' @entity110 , @entity62 168 ' , according to @entity43 .			1
