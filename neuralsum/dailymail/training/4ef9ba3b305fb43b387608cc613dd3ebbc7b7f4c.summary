by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity4 terrorists held a massive military rally just a few miles from the @entity7 compound in @entity8 , @entity9 during the summer of 2012 and called for the murder of @entity1 diplomats , it was revealed today			1
and the @entity1 government knew about it by august , a full month before the attack that left the @entity1 ambassador and three others dead , official papers state			1
@entity19 flags were out in full force at the june 7 - 8 event , a two - day rally including 300 armed men gathered in @entity8 's @entity24			2
just days later on june 11 , bombers targeted the @entity8 @entity1 mission , blowing 40 - foot hole in the installation 's perimeter wall			2
the larger attack came three months later			0
the @entity1 diplomatic outpost in @entity8 erupted in flames during a terror attack by armed militants on september 11 , 2012 , just months after @entity19 - linked groups rallied in the city with dozens of military vehicles @entity38 , the group behind the @entity8 attack , frequently holds rallies in @entity41 like this one in @entity42			1
the @entity1 government knew a similar event happened in @entity8 in june 2012 , yet did nothing to shore up security the @entity47 report , prepared for a @entity49 intelligence subagency , described the june @entity8 rally in detail , saying it involved ' battalions ' of jihadis from several @entity56 cities on wednesday investors @entity57 drew on research by the nonprofit @entity60 to detail parts of a damning august 2012 report by the @entity47 's federal research arm			1
the report , delivered to the federal government two months later , predicted @entity19 would soon begin employing ' selective terrorism , threats , intimidation and assassination			0
' it described ' dozens of military vehicles ' on display in june , including heavy automatic machine guns , rocket launchers and truck - mounted anti-aircraft weapons			0
' they had a crapload of stuff , ' a former @entity1 security officer told ibd			0
' they were itching to use it			0
' islamists at the event , organized by the @entity19 - linked group @entity38 , made credible threats that terrorists were prepared to assassinate @entity1 personnel in the city			2
' it was like a team pep rally before the game , only for jihad , " a @entity1 intelligence analyst told the newspaper			2
' the @entity1 military has long known that @entity19 's model moves quickly from the establishment of clandestine terror cells to open attacks on @entity105 in urban areas military hardware is everywhere in @entity8 : a truck - mounted heavy machine gun belonging to @entity9 -- ' @entity9 shield ' -- a group the @entity7 trusted to help secure the @entity8 compound			1
they fled when the fighting erupted , and some reports say they joined in the attack @entity9 posted a photo of this self - propelled antiaircraft gun on @entity119 , showing the kind of military muscle jihadi groups in @entity8 had at their disposal @entity38 was later named as the group most likely behind the september 11 attack , which left the @entity1 diplomatic station and a nearby @entity128 annex in ruins			1
according to the august 2012 report , @entity1 intelligence analysts documented a ' military show of force ' consisting of ' a parade in which some 30 battalions from @entity8 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , and other @entity56 towns took part in the first meeting in support of sharia in @entity8			1
' ' @entity146 leaders pointed out that the aim of the military parade was to " terrorize " those who do not want to be judged by @entity150 's law			0
' the unclassified august report , issued under an agreement with the @entity49 's @entity153 , coincided with a @entity7 warning , telling @entity1 citizens to avoid traveling in @entity9			2
but during the same time the agency refused to provide ambassador @entity157 and his team with long - requested additional security			2
flags like this @entity19 banner flew above @entity8 in june 2012 during a rally designed to terrify westerners and anyone else who refused to accept shariah law @entity38 , an @entity4 - affiliated group , has tanks , rocket launchers , and other heavy weapons at their disposal throughout the @entity171 world			1
this image was captured in southern @entity173 on april 28 , 2012 @entity38 openly holds rallies , marches and news conferences in the @entity177 , often boasting that they hold power in cities where police presences are nonexistent and government control is weak the analyst quoted in the @entity184 story said that the @entity1 intelligence community was well aware of the threats documented in the august report			1
' we all read the same stuff , ' the analyst said			0
' it gets circular , going through all the relevant government agencies			0
that report for the @entity194 office got passed around a lot			0
' the report also warned that @entity19 's senior leadership had issued ' strategic guidance ' to followers in @entity9 , telling them to ' gather weapons , establish training camps , build a network in secret , establish an @entity206 state , and institute sharia			0
' the @entity7 did not return a phone call seeking comment			0
@entity1 ambassador to @entity9 @entity157 was viciously killed during the september 11 , 2012 @entity8 attack , and security analysts now believe his death was preventable given available intelligence from the region the attack was led by @entity38 militants , the same group that paraded its military might and made threats of assassinations in @entity8 three months earlier			1

a report prepared for the government in august 2012 described a massive military presence of @entity38 , the group behind the @entity8 attack
it warned ' assassinations ' would follow , and said the first attack on the @entity1 diplomatic station quickly followed the two - day june rally in @entity8
@entity7 intelligence *undoubtedly* saw the report , yet the agency denied frequent requests for extra security in the city
the sept. 11 , 2012 attack left @entity1 ambassador to @entity9 @entity157 and three other @entity1 dead , and razed the facility
