by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 17 july 2013 a learner driver has received a ticking off from a 999 operator after he called to say he had received a ticking off from his driving instructor			1
the unnamed man contacted @entity5 when his lesson was terminated after he ' gave her attitude ' for turning up 10 minutes late			1
he told them that he needed to complain to someone but his call has been branded as ' ridiculous ' and a waste of time and resources			1
they have released audio of the phone call made last thursday at 8am to highlight how time - wasting calls to 999 can cost lives			1
scroll down to listen to the audio complaint : a learner driver dialled 999 to complain after his driving instructor terminated their lesson because he was ' giving her attitude ' for being late ( stock image ) the learner driver , who has not been named by @entity5 , can be heard telling the operator : ' sorry , it 's silly , but i 've got an emergency '			1
he then continues speaking in a rush , saying : ' the person who ’s supposed to be teaching me came late and now she ’s asking me to get out of her car			0
she ’s saying i ’m giving her attitude			0
can you please come over ? ' the operator then asks the man to slow down and explain what has happened			0
he tells the operator : ' i know it 's not an emergency but she 's telling me i 'm giving her attitude and to get out of her car			2
i need someone to complain to			0
' the operator calmly explains that the problem is n't one for the police and the man needs to contact the driving instructor 's company or the @entity50			1
when the learner driver persists , the operator tells him he must get out of the instructors car if he has been told to do so and warned trivial matters do n’t qualify as 999 emergencies			1
the call is the latest in a series of nuisance calls to @entity59 police			2
warning : police described the 999 call as ' ridiculous ' and warned that time wasting phone calls can lead to delays in answering real emergencies officers say other ‘ emergencies ’ they have been called to in recent weeks include one person who had a blocked sink plug in a hotel room and someone who had forgot their computer password			1
@entity73 chief inspector @entity72 said : ' we regularly receive calls on the 9s about lost property , people asking for directions and revellers who ’ve been denied entry to nightclubs			0
' it ’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth			0
each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but , if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency , then a minute is a very long time to wait			2
' i can not stress enough the 999 number is for emergencies only			0
this is defined as a crime in progress , if someone suspected of a crime is nearby , when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened			0
to contact police for any other reason , call 101			2
' @entity5 said they get more than 1,500 calls to their 999 number each day and staff have to deal with each one professionally			1
other police forces blighted by nonsense emergency calls include @entity112 , who told of a man calling who had lost his trainers , a child refusing to go to bed and people having problems watching films on @entity122			0
in parts of the country forces are taking up to 30 per cent longer than two years ago to react to 999 calls a recent investigation has revealed .			0

@entity5 have branded the call as ' ridiculous ' and ' time wasting '
police released audio of the learner driver 's *conversation* with 999 operator
officers warn that being called about *non-emergencies* can cost lives
