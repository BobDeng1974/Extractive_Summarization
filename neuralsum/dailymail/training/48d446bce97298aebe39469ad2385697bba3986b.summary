@entity8 dropped 10 stone from 24 stone ( left ) to 14 stone ( right ) after taking part in the @entity7 and being inspired to become a fitness instructor @entity8 decided to take part in the @entity7 following a holiday to @entity22 with her ex-husband			1
the disastrous trip - which @entity25 - made her realise she needed to tackle her weight , and she plucked up courage to apply for the show			2
@entity8 had never been comfortable with her size , having gained weight steadily throughout her teens			1
but the most rapid weight gain happened when she went to university			2
@entity8 's weight reached 24 stone and began to impede on her life , preventing her from participating in activities and causing her embarressment with constant yo - yo diets causing fluctuations of up to a stone or more throughout her life , her weight steadily crept up to 24st			1
though she aware her weight was too high , it was a holiday to @entity22 that brought the issue home			2
@entity8 said : ' rather than one defining moment , there were a number of things that pushed me to lose weight			1
i went travelling round @entity22 with my , now , ex-husband , and a number of things about the trip affected me			0
@entity8 was unhappy with her weight but felt she could n't control it			2
now she has a new lease of life @entity8 was inspired to become a fitness instructor and now helps others to lose weight and get fit ' firstly , clothing was an issue			1
it was really hard to buy some necessary items , such as waterproof trousers , in my size and , when packing , my clothes took up more space which made packing lightly impossible			2
' on the trip itself , my weight impacted what i could to			2
whilst trekking in @entity71 i was unable to take part in all of the walks ; having to do the shorter options or , in some cases , completely miss out as it was too much for me			0
' i felt very conscious of my size on the flights , especially when asking for seatbelt extenders			2
flying with my then - husband made me feel a bit better as i could take up some of his space but , when i flew alone between @entity83 and @entity84 , i ended up sat between a couple of larger gentleman and it was very uncomfortable for all of us			0
@entity8 says the problems her weight caused while she was traveling in @entity22 inspired her to apply for @entity7 ' little things , individually , built up - things in everyday life that made me feel uncomfortable , both emotionally and physically , and made me want to change			1
' in 2011 , @entity8 found herself walking up to the @entity7 house with her sister - in - law @entity96			1

@entity8 , seen here with another contestant , became the female winner on @entity7 , with the largest percentage weight loss , losing a whopping 6 stone 6 lbs @entity8 said : ' the energy and enthusiasm of the instructors always lifted me to work harder however tired i was and regardless of how much time i had spent working out that day or week			1
' inspired by the classes by fitness brand @entity117 , @entity8 decided to become a fitness instructor : ' i decided to train in my favourite class : @entity121			1
' i found that i could get rid of all of my frustrations and lose myself in the class , punching and kicking to the music			2
i would always come out smiling , knowing i 'd worked hard , so i decided to start teaching			0
' @entity8 says she loves inspiring others to losing weigh but does n't believe in punishing yourself @entity8 is now a qualified fitness instructor and personal trainer , and she has shed over 10st in total			1

' @entity8 also loves that she inspires others to lose weight , and advises people to to make the lifestyle changes to improve their quality of life			1
' i know that my weight loss has inspired lots of people to lose weight and get fit			1
' people that have followed my journey on the show and people that have seen me working out in the gym and changing shape over the last couple of years have seen what i 've done and know that change is achievable			2
' in my opinion you can make it hard for yourself or you can make it easy , it 's a question of how you approach it			0
' the key thing is to remember you always have a choice ; you can eat what you want and you can do as much or as little , as you want - but you need to accept the consequences of that decision			0
' the best thing is to find what works for you : there is no magic answer for everyone			0
' find exercise you enjoy , change a couple of things at a time and , most importantly , enjoy the journey			0
' it 's not about punishing yourself , it 's about treating yourself well - enjoying learning what your body is capable of and how much better you feel when you eat healthily and exercise			0
' do n't obsess over a number on the scales as it can be affected by so many factors			0
' instead , concentrate on how you feel , and look at your clothing size or measurements			0
' of course , people told me these things before my journey , and i had to go through the process to discover it for myself			0
' the best thing you can do is start making changes now			0
do n't wait until tomorrow , or monday			0
