by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 6 february 2013 it may have seemed like a clever advertising ploy but a company 's attempt to use ' real ' customers to promote itself has backfired after they were targeted in a series of @entity9 attacks			1
in the series of commercials @entity10 urges viewers to contact @entity14 , @entity15 ' @entity16 and @entity17 who claim to love the company and want to share their experiences			2
but instead of genuine inquiries about download speeds , the trio have been besieged by hundreds of irrelevant , odd and very funny questions			1
scroll down to watch ad @entity26 is one of the three @entity10 ' real customers ' who have been bombarded by irrelevant questions since the campaign began many of the questions have been about how much the three have been paid to promote @entity10 questions have ranged from whether the three are actually robots to if the fast download speeds can help one user find his mother			1
the three , who say they are real customers , have also been revealed to be working actors			1
@entity14 and @entity26 work for @entity42 theatre companies and @entity17 is an actress based in @entity43			0
they say while they have been ' incentivized ' to promote the company , all their good experiences are genuine			0
@entity48 summed up the tone of most of the messages with his question to @entity26 : ' how much are they paying you to promote this s * * * man			0
' @entity14 , who is also a working actress , has been asked if she can help find one @entity9 users mother and help another with his cocaine problem @entity17 had to tell one another that she wants to talk about @entity10 and not if she likes unicorns when another user insinuated @entity14 was only talking about @entity10 for the money she retorted : ' i do n't know why this upsets you so much			1
i 'm trying to answer questions and help everybody out : ) ' many other @entity9 users have wanted to know why she had not used her account for two years before the campaign began			2
@entity15 wrote : ' why no tweets in your 2 years history then all sudden you become activate			0
if you are fake then my whole life has been a lie			0
' she replied : ' a lot of people ask that			2
i made a twitter just to follow celebs and stuff			0
i used by fb for social networking			0
' each of the three featured customers has a disclaimer written on their page : ' this @entity9 user is a real @entity10 customer incentivized by @entity10 to share his / her own opinions and thoughts on @entity10 service			1
' the thoughts and opinions expressed by participants in this program are completely independent of @entity10			2
' however , when questioned neither of the three will reveal how much they have been paid to promote the company			0
other questions have been more unusual			2
@entity105 pleaded with @entity14 to use the company 's fast speeds to help him find his mother , while some men were concerned with how quickly they would be able to download porn			1
one man asked @entity17 whether she liked unicorns and @entity113 was asked to help one person with their cocaine addiction			0
however , despite the provocation the @entity10 trio do not seem able to retaliate but have to be polite at all times .			1

@entity10 used ' real ' customers in their *latest* advertising campaign
but the trio have been besieged by people asking irrelevant questions
they have been asked if they are robots and if fast internet speeds can help them with their drug problems or even find their mother
