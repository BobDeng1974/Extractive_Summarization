@entity0 are usually renowned for exaggerating how big things are in their country , but there ’s no need for this in @entity6 – not when you ’ve got earthworms the size of snakes			2
this is what the @entity13 family found out when they spotted two giant earthworms near their @entity18 home on the @entity19			1
‘ at first glance we thought they were snakes			1
it was just this dark long object on a pale tile , ’ @entity13 told @entity20			2
but after a closer look the snakes turned out to be giant earthworms			2
the two worms measured between 60cm and a metre long			0
’ the heavy rain that hit @entity37 when @entity38 passed by was what brought the giant earthworms to the surface			1
earthworms are uncomfortable when the ground is very saturated and they were probably looking for higher ground during bad weather			0
it 's this big : @entity27 lays the giant earthworm on the floor to show how long it is ‘ they were massive			1
the ones i ’m used to seeing are more like spaghetti			2
there was one in the garage that was crawling slowly along the concrete , while the other one appeared a few days later on a mat on our patio , ’ @entity13 said			2
@entity13 had lived in @entity61 for eight years , so she when she put pictures of the giant earthworms on @entity64 her @entity61 friends could not believe it			1
‘ the best comment was : ‘ in @entity61 we call that a snake			0
’ they were all pretty shocked			0
a few others said they were going to come and visit me after seeing this , ’ she said			0
@entity27 was fascinated by the huge earthworm and could n't wait to pick it up ‘ but even my @entity6 friends were pretty surprised at the size of them			1
’ @entity13 ’s seven - year - old daughter @entity27 was fascinated by the worms , and could n’t wait to pick them up and inspect them			1
‘ she put on a gardening glove and picked it up			0
she was very gentle when she picked it up			0
then it expanded and got even longer			0
we put it in the garden and watched it make its way slowly back underground , ’ she said			0
one giant earthworm was found lying down the side of the @entity13 's garage floor			1

@entity13 spotted the two giant worms at her @entity18 home
the heavy rain from @entity38 brought them to the surface
at first the shocked @entity13 family thought they were snakes
' the ones i ’m used to seeing are more like spaghetti , ' says @entity13
but the giant worm ' fascinated ' her seven - year - old daughter , @entity27
