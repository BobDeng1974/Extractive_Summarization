from chocolate to pickles , many women experience intense cravings during pregnancy			2
but @entity5 , 25 , began to experience an even more bizarre urge : eating toilet paper			1
the full time mother , of @entity9 , @entity10 , first developed the bizarre snacking habit while she was expecting her youngest son @entity12			2
the mother - of - five now eats as much as an entire loo roll 's worth every day			1
more than a year after giving birth she still can not resist the cravings , and eats up to a loo roll a day			1
she is pictured left and right with some toilet paper she suspects she suffers from @entity22 , a condition in which people eat objects which are not suitable to be consumed and have no nutritional value			1
people have been known to eat dirt , glass , pain and sand , as well as household objects like carpets , candles and sponges			1
miss @entity5 said : ' two months into the pregnancy , i started craving toilet roll			1
i still do n't know why			0
' i like the feeling of the texture in my mouth , rather than the taste			0
' my family tell me it is n't very good for me - but i ca n't help it			0
' @entity22 can cause a range of serious complications if the person eats something that is poisonous or indigestible			1
it is not known why some women develop @entity22 cravings during pregnancy , but there may be a connection to an iron deficiency , according to the @entity58			1
and eating non-food substances is potentially harmful to both the mother and the baby , the @entity59 warns			1
this is because eating non-food substances may interfere with the nutrients from healthy food being absorbed and cause a deficiency			2
thankfully , miss @entity5 's son @entity68 was born healthy and is developing normally			1
@entity22 is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value			1
these can include stones , sand , paint and dirt			0
it is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy			1
it can cause a range of serious complications if the patient is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible			2
these include being poisoned by toxic ingredients and having a part of the body obstructed ( which is often seen in people who eat hair )			1
it can also lead to excessive calorie intake or nutritional deprivation if the person eats a substance with no nutritional value instead of nutritive foods			1
parasitic infections and dental injury can also occur			0
but despite the fact it has now been a year since she gave birth , she still ca n't break the habit of ingesting loo roll			1
she said : ' i thought the cravings would stop after i gave birth but they have n't			2
i keep coming back for more			0
' it ca n't be doing my insides any good , but it has n't caused me any health problems or any illness			0
' she waits until she needs to go to the toilet where she will eat a few sheets of toilet tissue in private , chewing and swallowing up to a roll a day			1
' while i was pregnant i went to the loo and looked at the toilet roll and thought ' i have to eat that ' - i know it sounds silly			1
' today i try and hold off going to the bathroom because i know if i go i will eat the paper			1
' i usually eat around eight pieces per visit - sometimes i go to the bathroom just to get some toilet roll			1
' it does fill me up quite a bit			0
at first i used to eat a couple of squares at a time , but i keep eating more and more			2
' her favourite types are the supermarket - own brands , rather than more expensive products like @entity138			0
she said : ' different brands taste different			0
i have one roll in the bathroom for eating and one to be used normally			2
' miss @entity5 has five children - four boys called @entity144 , eight , @entity145 , six , @entity146 , five and @entity12 , one , and a daughter called @entity148 , five			2
miss @entity5 said : ' i try to hide it from my kids , if they spot me eating toilet roll they tell me off			1
' if my daughter sees me she says , ' spit it out @entity154 , spit it down the toilet '			0
' last month @entity157 reported on a teenage girl who can resist chocolates and crisps , but ca n't fight the urge to snack on sponges @entity164 , 18 , from @entity165 , has suffered the addiction since she was five years old			2
she cuts the sponges into small pieces and sucks on them throughout the day , getting through at least two large sponges a week			2
miss @entity164 , who attends @entity171 , said : ' i have always loved the smell of a wet sponge			0
' i crave that damp taste and feeling in my mouth			0
' i like the texture as well , it 's a bit like eating cake			0
' i might try one with some icing on one day			0
if i have a stressful day i love to treat myself to snack on a sponge to relax			0
' her habit has resulted in her being admitted to hospital			0
when she was 13 , she had to have an operation to remove a large ball of sponge from her stomach			0
