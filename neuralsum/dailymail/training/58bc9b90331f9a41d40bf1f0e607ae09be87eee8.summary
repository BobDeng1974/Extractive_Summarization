by @entity0 @entity1 scammed £ 40,000 in state handouts over four and a half years - but was given a 20 - week sentence a judge has condemned ‘ ludicrously low ’ guidelines for sentencing welfare fraudsters after handing one woman a punishment that would see her clear the debt only if she lived to 105			1
judge @entity11 ’s comments came after she ordered mother - of - two @entity1 to pay back £ 40,000 in fraudulent benefits			1
@entity14 , 38 , can afford to pay only £ 10.95 a week , meaning it would take her a total of 67 years to repay the taxpayer			1
judge @entity11 also said the guidelines fail to act as a deterrent , as people assume they will escape prison if they are convicted of fiddling the benefit system			1
she handed @entity14 a sentence of 20 weeks in prison , the most severe punishment she could impose under current guidelines			1
@entity14 could be free after serving only ten weeks behind bars if she maintains good behaviour , and that could be further reduced to just five weeks if she is deemed suitable for an electronic tag			1
judge @entity11 said : ‘ the guideline sentences set down by the @entity34 , which judges must follow , are so ludicrously low that everyone thinks the sentences will automatically be suspended			1
’ she told @entity14 it was unlikely that the stolen money would ever be recovered , and said the payback scheme was ‘ clearly not acting as a deterrent ’			1
custodial terms for those who plead not guilty can range between 12 weeks and 18 months depending on the amount of money stolen and the length of time over which the fraud took place			2
those who plead guilty , saving the cost of a trial , can expect reductions of around a third on their jail terms – and will often serve just half of their reduced sentence			2
@entity14 claimed thousands in income support , housing and council tax benefits after falsely claiming her boyfriend , @entity62 , had moved out @entity65 @entity64 heard @entity14 claimed income support , housing and council tax benefits			1
she signed a form declaring that she was single and said she had no income other than child tax credits and child benefits			0
judge @entity11 said the sentencing guidelines were ' ludicrously low ' and appeared not to be deterring benefits cheat but @entity74 , prosecuting , said surveillance was carried out on her home which showed her 45 - year - old partner @entity62 going to and from the address			1
his car was usually found either parked outside the house or at his workplace at a logistics firm			0
further investigations found mr @entity62 ’s car was insured at that address and the couple had a house insurance policy together			0
@entity88 said @entity14 bragged of buying new widescreen televisions , a three - piece suite and a gas cooker worth around £ 1,000			1
when she was caught , @entity14 – who has two children aged eight and 13 – pleaded guilty to three counts of dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances			2
but she told officers from the @entity97 that committing welfare fraud was an ‘ easy option ’			2
judge @entity11 told her : ‘ too many people like you think it ’s the easy option			2
you have no thought for those people who were in genuine need of the money that you defrauded			2
’ last night one of @entity14 ’s neighbours said : ‘ i think the judge was right , it is ludicrous			1
if i had done something like that i would expect to go to jail for a substantial time			0
the council house she claimed the money from in @entity118 , @entity65 , @entity119 , has since been boarded up judge @entity11 slammed the sentence she was forced to give @entity14 at @entity121 , pictured under sentencing guidelines , defendants over 18 who are convicted after a trial of fiddling around £ 60,000 state benefits after initially making a legitimate claim for welfare will usually face 36 weeks in jail			1
the custodial terms for those who plead not guilty can range between 12 weeks and 18 months depending on the amount of money stolen and the length of time over which the fraud took place			2
those who plead guilty and spare the cost of running a jury trial can expect reductions of around a third on proposed jail terms - and will serve just half that			0
‘ i would expect more than a slap on the wrist			0
it does n’t give out a very good message to people			0
it ’s terrible she has got away with what she has done but i ’m not surprised			0
' nothing surprises me about the justice system these days			0
’ a woman who claimed benefits for agoraphobia while travelling the world has been jailed for a year			0
@entity158 , 52 , said she was so unwell that she could not leave her house in the @entity161 town of @entity162			0
but she went to @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 while claiming benefits of £ 50,000			0
@entity168 , prosecuting , said : ‘ this is one of the worst cases of benefit fraud we have seen			0
making a false claim to suffer from agoraphobia undermines those who suffer from this debilitating condition			0

@entity1 scammed £ *38,000* in state handouts in more than four years
she bragged crime was ' easy ' and spent the money on tvs and *furniture*
sentencing guidelines meant judge forced to hand her 20 week sentence
but she could to be released on *license* after serving just a *quarter* of that
@entity14 also allowed to pay back the money at a rate of just £ 10 a week
judge says the guidelines are ' ludicrously low ' and are not a deterrent
