a chair held aloft , its legs already shattered from being hurled across the room , this image could easily come from the middle a riot or a particularly nasty bar fight			2
but this was the scene inside the @entity9 parliament yesterday after a session to decide the country 's new constitution descended into chaos			1
three parliamentarians - including @entity15 , leader of the ruling party - were injured during the scuffle , alongside three security staff who tried to intervene			0
they are bitterly opposed to the current proposals , which they say will marginalise them @entity37 broke out after members of the minority @entity29 party hurled furniture and microphones at the house speaker during a session in the capital @entity46			1
the punch - up began at the end of an all - night session of parliament aimed at drawing up a new constitution , which is due to be signed into law on thursday			1
with the ruling coalition and opposition parties at loggerheads , the speaker proposed a vote on the constitution , as opposed to getting all 605 mps to agree unanimously			2
that prompted leaders of the @entity29 parties to hurl their microphones , followed shortly by their tables and chairs , in fierce opposition to the current proposals			1
the latest draft of the constitution has the backing of around two thirds of the country 's mps , meaning that it would likely pass any ballot			2

they are calling for new provinces to be created which would give them greater power			0
@entity9 has been trying to agree a new constitution since 2006 when the @entity72 ended their armed rebellion			0

officially the current batch of mps have until 2018 to draw up a new constitution , but had hoped to push the legislation through sooner , as the uncertainty has been hurting @entity9 's economy			1
annual growth in the fledgling nation has dropped from 6.1 per cent in 2008 to 3.6 per cent in 2013 , according to @entity149 data .			0
