by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:29 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 02:39 est , 25 september 2012 a shopper has claimed more than £ 8,600 worth of free goods through a loophole in a supermarket ’s money back scheme			1
the 34 - year - old cashed in on @entity9 ’s promise to refund the difference in cost if customers bought items cheaper from a rival			1
but its computer system grossly undervalued products at other supermarkets , allowing canny shoppers to claim money - off vouchers worth up to £ 40 after every trip to the store			1
shoppers have hit @entity9 for potentially hundreds of thousands of pounds of vouchers by exploiting a glitch under the @entity27 , customers enter their receipt details into a website and print off coupons if the goods cost less at a comparative shop elsewhere			1
as well as the refund , they claim a bonus of ten per cent			0
capped : @entity27 vouchers will no longer exceed £ 15 shoppers were supposed to be limited to a maximum of ten vouchers of any value worth a total of £ 100 a month			1
but they could circumvent this by using a different computer and email address to generate more coupons			0
the customer , who lives in @entity46 , claimed to have bought £ 8,670 worth of groceries in just four weeks with the coupons			0
the man , who did not wish to be named , said he was stockpiling goods in his attic , even selling some on			0
‘ i am making anything from £ 5 to £ 600 a day , ’ he said			2
‘ my attic is full of a stockpile of stuff			0
if you can get something for near enough free then you might as well do it			0
‘ there are trigger items such as rice pudding , hair gel and cereal			0
i will buy them all for £ 40 then get a voucher for £ 37 so effectively i get them for free			2
‘ i go back to the store three hours later and do it all again			0
i sell a few of the items so i ’m making a profit , but generally i stockpile the products for the family			0
’ the system used for the scheme is operated by the price comparison website @entity76 on behalf of @entity9			1
@entity9 limits customers to ten vouchers a month and those ten vouchers can not exceed £ 100			1
but savvy shoppers have found a way to exploit the system			0
they have found that using a new email address with each voucher request and entering made - up addresses with random postcodes , they can avoid the cap on vouchers			2
shoppers on consumer site @entity91 have pooled receipts which identify products triggering higher value money - off vouchers			0
retail magazine @entity96 highlighted the ruse in a trial where the system mistakenly calculated @entity9 ’s rivals to be much cheaper on certain products			1
it correctly identified that @entity9 ’s basket of goods cost £ 25.30 but calculated that @entity105 ’s identical items cost only £ 8.57 instead of £ 30.87			1
this led to a voucher for £ 17.59 when none should have been issued as the @entity105 goods cost more			1
an @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ a very small number of our savviest customers have been able to beat the system and claim a few , larger than normal vouchers			1
’ the supermarket chain has now capped the coupons to £ 15 per shop up to a total of £ 100 a month			1
huddle : a notice from @entity9 was posted on the @entity91 forum detailing the changes @entity9 's problems are with always calculating the correct amount for customers ' money - off vouchers			1
@entity129 had a similar experience to @entity9 with money - off vouchers last year			1
the supermarket had to change their voucher offer after shoppers exploited a promotion			2
their changes included a cap to the value in which customers could redeem in vouchers , requiring shoppers to use a clubcard and also implementing unique barcodes			2
@entity129 called in the police as it suspected its vouchers were being obtained fraudulently			0
in one case , @entity147 arrested a shopper in @entity129 's @entity151 store who was charged with fraud and the case set for @entity155			0
however , the @entity156 withdrew the case when the police were unable to produce a vital exhibit			0
a spokesperson for the police said : ‘ @entity147 was unable to provide the vouchers in question in relation to this case and therefore it was deemed that there was insufficient evidence to proceed			0
’ it has been making school boy errors , but as often happens with technology there has been no easy fix			0
the supermarket promises to be 10 per cent cheaper than rivals @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity129 and @entity105 on a comparable basket of shopping			2
customers enter their @entity9 till receipt into the @entity27 website which compares @entity9 prices to competitors and issues a money - off voucher for the difference plus 10 per cent if @entity9 is more expensive			1
but @entity9 's software has been doing the opposite to what the supermarket intends			1
instead of reflecting the generally held view that @entity9 is the cheapest of the big supermarkets , thus delivering a few low value vouchers by comparing its prices to more expensive rivals , it has been giving customers buying a basket of certain items , vouchers of £ 30 , £ 40 and more			1
as lists of what products to buy to cash - in have become available on the internet , the supermarket has stemmed its losses by capping vouchers at £ 15.00 while it tries to correct its maths			1
the software running the @entity27 is provided by @entity209 - based price comparison website mysupermarket.co.uk			1
it collects prices for @entity9 stores , connecting directly with the @entity213 web service located in the @entity214 that collects data from all @entity213 operations around the globe , including @entity9 in the @entity218			2
for @entity9 online , it collects prices off @entity9 's website overnight along with all the prices that appear on websites for @entity175 , @entity129 and @entity105			2
@entity129 has 400 regional sets of price data so each of these variations is collected overnight and price comparisons are accurate to where you live			1
@entity174 does not make its prices available online so these are collected twice a week in - store			0
as in life what can go wrong does go wrong			0
the simplest of variations can set off an incorrect calculation for a customer 's money off voucher			0
supermarkets discontinue hundreds of lines and use an accounting practice of reducing prices to a few pence to cover the last few bits of stock left somewhere on a top shelf			0
@entity76 captures these 1p and 2p prices as it captures all prices			0
@entity250 : a @entity129 out - of - stock price of 3p captured for three weeks on mysupermarket for @entity254 orange juice meant that @entity9 gave customers buying it for £ 1 a money - off voucher for 98p			1
a @entity129 out - of - stock price of 3p captured for three weeks on mysupermarket for @entity254 orange juice meant that @entity9 gave customers buying it for £ 1 a money - off voucher for 94p , so it was 10 per cent cheaper than @entity129 even though @entity254 was not actually available in @entity129 for 3p			1
@entity261 , vp @entity262 for mysupermarket said : ‘ we have an agreed policy with @entity9 that if a product is out - of - stock at any of the retailers for a period of more than 7 days then it comes off the system and therefore the comparison			2
‘ this of course means that on rare occasions these low priced products might exist on the system for a few days or less enabling the more observant shoppers to take advantage and work the system			2
’ @entity9 has taken action to separate its own accounting 1p type prices into a separate file so they can not be picked up on mysupermarket			0
a spokesperson said : ‘ to ensure compliance with our own strict procedures , we have appointed an independent audit team to monitor the prices displayed on our website , with the authority to remove content if they uncover any pricing errors			0
’ the current glitch that @entity9 has been unable to resolve for four weeks understates the price of a few products that the supermarket 's competitors have on 3 - for - 2 offer			1
mr @entity300 said the level of interest being generated online by the glitch was good publicity for the supermarket			0
‘ the thousands of messages on forums is a pr coup for @entity9 , ’ he said			2
mr @entity261 said there was no question the software company would refund @entity9 for the cost of errors			2
‘ this of course is an irrelevant question since it is not us that is setting the prices			0
in addition , the @entity27 system is wholly owned and operated by @entity9			1

@entity27 scheme offers vouchers to customers if supermarket competitors prove to be cheaper
glitch in system means price comparisons have been calculated wrongly
@entity330 could have cost @entity9 hundreds of thousands of pounds
voucher limit of £ 15 now in place to stop customers making thousands
