by @entity0 published : 03:44 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 10:25 est , 7 november 2013 as more and more people are becoming obese , a council has resorted to expanding the size of its graves to accommodate bigger bodies			1
@entity6 in @entity7 , where more than a quarter of the adult population is classified as obese , has agreed to expand average grave sizes by 10 per cent in a bid to cater for larger bodies			1
the town suffers from above average adult obesity rates and some cemeteries have already struggled to fit some larger coffins into the 9ft by 4ft graves currently provided			1
expanding : @entity19 is digging larger graves in its cemeteries to accommodate bigger bodies @entity22 , @entity23 councillor responsible for environment and leisure , said : ' the plots have been increased in size to give everybody a chance			1
' the actual graves are getting bigger , as you can appreciate , because some people are getting larger			1
' i think it ’s something that ’s been noticed by councils all over the place , that people are getting bigger			0
' it comes after many undertakers started providing the option of ' super-size coffins ' for larger bodies			1
some funeral parlours in @entity45 have even had to install hoists capable of lifting 50 stone , purchase reinforced steel trollies and increase the size of their fridges in order to manage larger corpses			2
hospital morgues and crematoriums have already had to make alterations to deal with the changes , such as installing extra-large furnaces			0
wide : larger coffins that are needed to house obese bodies while a standard casket typically measures between 24 and 27 inches wide , manufacturers are now producing boxes as wide as 52 inches , capable of fitting a person weighing up to 1,000 pounds			1
the move comes despite a shortage of space in graveyards across the country which has led to councils considering ‘ reusing ’ old grave sites			0
experts have labeled the space shortage a crisis with a recent survey revealing some councils could run out of burial space within the next 20 years			0
mr @entity22 went onto explain that two plots can be bought to accommodate extremely large coffins although a two foot separation between graves is needed to prevent collapse			2
he added : ' you can end up with a collapse if you ’re not careful , i think that ’s uppermost in people ’s minds			0
' wide load : obesity is forcing ambulance bosses to revamp their fleets to cope with obese patients among the improvements are specially - strengthened stretchers capable of expanding to take extra weight and motorised stretchers to help staff lift heavy patients ambulance bosses have also started paying out millions to ‘ supersize ’ their vehicles to cope with the growing number of obese casualties			2
