mr @entity20 told @entity26 that @entity4 - known as @entity16 - and her husband @entity27 , 33 , had elected for her to have a caesarean section , but the couple were ' reluctantly ' persuaded to discard their birth plan to allow labour to progress spontaneously overnight			1
mrs @entity4 eventually needed an emergency caesarean and suffered heavy bleeding afterwards			1

her husband is now bringing up @entity6 and the couple 's other son @entity38 , four			2
mrs @entity4 , who was affectionately called ' mrs coffee ' by her pupils , was a @entity41 teacher at @entity42 , near @entity43 , @entity25			1
at the time of the tragedy , staff were said to be ' shell shocked ' and decided to close the small 200 - pupil village school for a day to help children come to terms with her death			0
mr @entity20 said it was ' unlikely ' an elective caesarean carried out on the evening of october 8 would have been complicated			2
he added that the family ' deeply regretted ' adopting a different course of action to the birth plan and spoke of the profound concern displayed by the family in witness statements given in the days following their tragic loss			0
mr @entity20 said there may be an issue concerning the extent to which parental preference for the mode of delivery could be overridden by obstetric staff at the hospital			0

mr @entity20 said liability had already been admitted by the @entity82 and @entity83 and there would be a civil claim for damages			0
the inquest into mrs @entity4 's death will take place in february a statement released by solicitor @entity91 read : ' the @entity4 family are relieved that the inquisitorial process has begun because it will give them the opportunity to understand how and why			2

shortly after her death , @entity114 , whose son @entity115 was taught by @entity16 , said : ' it is such a tragedy for this to happen , and to such a wonderful person just makes it feel so much more of a tragedy			0
