they took to the pitch to keep football fans ' spirits high while @entity5 's men were off at war			1
but there was one team that stood tall above the rest			0
thousands of female munition factory workers began playing the beautiful game during @entity12 , but the @entity13 from @entity14 played more beautifully than all the others			1
taught to play by naval ratings on a local beach , the @entity13 remained unbeaten throughout their two - year existence			2
stars : the @entity13 team of 1918 , including @entity21 who scored a hat - trick in the @entity24 @entity25 player : the @entity13 top player was coalminer 's daughter , @entity21 their star centre - forward was @entity21 , the daughter of a local coal miner , who scored 133 goals in one season , and even went on to play for @entity33			1

the @entity13 were the eventual winners , beating @entity38 of @entity39 at @entity40 in front of a crowd of 22,000			0
@entity43 scored a hat - trick			1
but despite the women being almost as popular on the pitch as the men had been before the war , when the boys returned home , the munition factories closed and the teams disbanded			1
several women tried to continue to play , but in 1921 , the @entity54 banned women 's football at their grounds - bringing to an end a colourful chapter in women 's sport which has long been overlooked			2
