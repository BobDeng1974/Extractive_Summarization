by @entity0 @entity2 bosses have revealed futuristic plans to beam power from space			1
they believe large arrays of space solar modules could send solar power to @entity9			1
the radical scheme could be used to power military installations and even cities			1
one concept under consideration uses reflectors to concentrate sunlight , and a satellite beams power to a receiver from orbit			1
the scheme uses a ' sandwich ' module , which packs all the electrical components between two square panels			1
the top side is a photovoltaic panel that absorbs the @entity28 ’s rays			2
an electronics system in the middle converts the energy to a radio frequency , and the bottom is an antenna that transfers the power toward a target on the ground			1
the modules would be assembled in space by robots to form a one kilometer , very powerful satellite			1
dr. @entity42 , a spacecraft engineer at the @entity44 , has built and tested two types of module to capture and transmit solar power			1
the scheme uses a ' sandwich ' module , which packs all the electrical components between two square panels			1
the top side is a photovoltaic panel that absorbs the @entity28 ’s rays			2
an electronics system in the middle converts the energy to a radio frequency , and the bottom is an antenna that transfers the power toward a target on the ground			1
the modules would be assembled in space by robots to form a one kilometer , very powerful satellite			1
a second design , a ' step ' module , modifies the sandwich design by opening it up , which allows it to receive more sunlight without overheating , thereby making it more efficient			2
even the @entity2 admits the plan sounds like a sci - fi plot			2
' it 's hard to tell if it 's nuts until you 've actually tried , ' he said			0
' launching mass into space is very expensive , ' says @entity42 , so finding a way to keep the components light is an essential part of his design			1
his sandwich module is four times more efficient than anything made previously			1
the step module design , now in the patent process , opens up the sandwich to look more like a zig - zag			0
this allows heat to radiate more efficiently , so the module can receive greater concentrations of sunlight without overheating			0
he also has a novel approach to solving the thermal problem , using the ' step ' module			0
the step module design , now in the patent process , opens up the sandwich to look more like a zig - zag			0
this allows heat to radiate more efficiently , so the module can receive greater concentrations of sunlight without overheating			0
compared to sandwich modules built previously for space solar power , dr. @entity42 says @entity44 's was " more than four times as efficient			1
' one of our key , unprecedented contributions has been testing under space - like conditions , ' said @entity42			2
using a specialized vacuum chamber at another facility would have been too expensive , so @entity42 built one himself			0
' it 's cobbled together from borrowed pieces , ' he said			0
the step module design , now in the patent process , opens up the sandwich to look more like a zig - zag			0
this allows heat to radiate more efficiently , so the module can receive greater concentrations of sunlight without overheating			0
@entity42 said one of the primary objections to space solar power is the idea of an antenna shooting a concentrated beam of energy through our atmosphere			1
but we already use radiofrequency and microwaves to send smaller amounts of energy all the time , he believes			0
' people might not associate radio waves with carrying energy , ' says @entity42 , ' because they think of them for communications , like radio , tv , or cell phones			0
' they do n't think about them as carrying usable amounts of power			2
' there are a few ways to mitigate this concern			0
first , the antenna sends energy only to a specific receiver that asks for it			0
second , using microwaves to send energy may be less objectionable than the higher power density required for lasers			2
dr. @entity42 holds a module he designed for space solar power in front of the customized vacuum chamber used to test it			1
third , sending the energy on a lower frequency increases the size of the antenna and receiver , but decreases the concentration of power			2
' the most sobering thing about all of this is scale , ' said @entity42			0
he imagines a one kilometer array of modules - not to mention the auxiliary sun reflectors			0
the @entity189 is the only satellite that , to date , has come close			1
it stretches a little longer than an american football field ; the array @entity42 is talking about would span nine			0
the modules would have to be launched separately , and then assembled in space by robots			1
that research is already being advanced by @entity44 's @entity198			0
' another area ripe for research , " adds @entity42 , ' is the system that would reflect and concentrate sunlight onto the modules			2
' @entity44 and others have also proposed using similar technology , but instead of deploying it to space , setting it up at a very high altitude in the stratosphere			2
' you would n't get the same 24 - hour energy , but you 'd be above the clouds and you 'd also have a longer daytime because you 're farther from the horizon			0

system could capture power in space and beam to @entity9
arrays of panels *1km* wide could be assembled by robots in orbit
could power military installations and even cities
would be nine times larger than the @entity189
