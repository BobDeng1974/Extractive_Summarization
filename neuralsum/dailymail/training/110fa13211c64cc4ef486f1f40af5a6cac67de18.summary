by @entity0 they look like something out of ' @entity4 ' picture book , but these stunning images were in fact taken in a @entity8 back garden			1
the images reveal the dramatic moment a caterpillar emerges into the world , complete with a huge appetite capable of eating its way through its own shell			2
the tiny caterpillar is born after ten days , and immediately starts eating in preparation for its dramatic transformation into a majestic butterfly			1
makeover : the beautiful close - ups of an orange - tip butterfly egg , taken by @entity22 , reveal how the tiny insect emerges from into the world just like a chicken the youngster is smaller than a baby 's little finger nail but will soon grow into a much bigger caterpillar before it changes into a pupa to enter the next stage of development			1
soon , it will start to chew its way through the developing seed pods of the plant , increasing in size several thousand-fold before changing into a pupa			0
a caterpillar will eat the seeds , developing seed pods and flower - heads , with one tiny caterpillar capable of eating up to six garlic mustard seed pods in a day			2
eggs - traordinary : the tiny caterpillar is born after ten days , and immediately starts eating in preparation for its dramatic transformation into a majestic butterfly peeking out : as it emerges from its shell , the tiny youngster can be hard to spot as it is smaller than a baby 's little finger nail - but it wo n't stay that way for long transformation : the baby caterpillar is seen here emerging from its shell , which it will later eat increasing in size several thousand-fold before changing into a pupa dinner time : a caterpillar will eat the seeds , developing seed pods and flower - heads , with one tiny caterpillar capable of eating up to six garlic mustard seed pods in a day the orange - tip is a spring butterfly found in gardens , along hedgerows and roadside verges - especially in an area close to water			1
females are white with black wing tips , while the males are more distinctive with white wing tips and a dark spot where the white and orange areas of the fore - wing meet			0

photographer @entity22 , from @entity8 , captured the sequence last year			2
he said : ‘ to photograph a caterpillar emerging from an egg requires special equipment and a fair measure of patience			0
‘ my equipment consisted of a digital camera connected to a microscope objective lens via a home - made bellows			1
‘ the latter was built from aluminium castings made by my son from melted - down saucepans			0
‘ the egg needed strong lighting which was provided by a home - made flash unit with four interconnected heads			0
’ the orange - tip is a spring butterfly found in gardens , along hedgerows and roadside verges in area close to water			1
females are white with black wing tips , while the males are more distinctive with white wing tips and a dark spot where the white and orange areas of the fore - wing meet			0
@entity82 - tip butterflies fly between mid-april and mid-june during which time the fully formed butterfly will lay its own eggs to start the process of transformation all over again			1
up close and personal : ' the egg needed strong lighting which was provided by a home - made flash unit with four interconnected heads , ' said photographer @entity22 fully grown : @entity82 - tip butterflies fly between mid-april and mid-june during which time the female butterfly will lay its own eggs to start the process all over again			1

@entity22 from @entity8 captured the sequence using a *simple* digital camera attached to a microscope lens
images show a tiny caterpillar *gradually* emerging from a orange - tip butterfly egg before eating its eggshell
it will soon turn into a pupa - the stage when it is encased in a chrysalis - before becoming a stunning butterfly
@entity82 - tip butterflies can be seen between mid-april and june during which time the females lay their eggs
