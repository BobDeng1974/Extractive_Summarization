by @entity0 it was a family day out for @entity2 today as she joined her mother @entity3 and father @entity4 at an equestrian event			1
but she did n't have to travel far , for the @entity6 is held at the princess royal 's @entity8 estate - where @entity2 also lives			1
as a result , all three looked relaxed and happy , with captain @entity4 throwing a protective arm around his daughter , while @entity3 cracked a joke before rubbing her nose			1
she also allowed herself a rare day off yesterday , when she joined racing fans for @entity34 at @entity35 yesterday			1
there , she joined @entity37 , @entity38 and his wife , @entity39 , in their box , where she was later seen chatting animatedly to unlikely racing fan , @entity43			0
although an unexpected guest , the actor , 52 , appeared to quickly get the hang of racing and looked positively delighted when he was serenaded with the @entity48 theme tune by the @entity49			0
out and about : @entity2 's sister - in - law @entity32 was also at the event in a pretty sea - green top close family : princess @entity3 , @entity53 and @entity2 burst into laughter as they enjoy their day out horse loving family : all three have or have had successful eventing careers - including @entity61 medals today 's outing was an altogether more low - key affair but offered her the rare chance to spend time with both parents , particularly as @entity53 , who is currently chef @entity68 for the @entity71 eventing team , is spending a considerable amount of time on the other side of the @entity75			1
his time there has n't been without scandal , however , after he left his second wife @entity79 for an @entity71 showjumper 30 years his junior			0
captain @entity4 ' relationship with @entity83 , 37 , is still thought to be going strong two years after it was revealed , and appears to have had little impact on his career			2
like his first wife @entity3 and daughter @entity2 , he has enjoyed enormous success in the world of equestrianism , beginning with his gold medal winning appearance at the @entity93 in 1972			2
day out : @entity2 shares a joke with @entity43 during a day out at the @entity35 race meeting yesterday day off : @entity2 , who wore a pretty @entity97 dress , has taken a couple of days out from training as well as @entity61 success , captain @entity4 won the @entity101 in 1971 and 1972 riding @entity102 , in 1974 on @entity103 , and in 1981 on @entity104			1
after he retired from the @entity105 , he continued to style himself captain @entity4 - which was allowed as junior cavalry officers whose civilian work involves equestrianism may continue to use their rank			2
while @entity2 is yet to win @entity61 gold , she will be hoping for a good performance in @entity28 later this month , with @entity115 selectors for @entity116 expected to be in the crowd			0
she will , at least , have the support of her @entity120 teammates @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , who are also expected to compete in @entity125			0
not so good : @entity43 looked less than impressed when his horse failed to come up with the goods exciting stuff : the unexpected appearance of @entity43 left the usually calm racegoers in a tizzy			0

@entity2 , *33* , was at the @entity6 at @entity8
she was joined by @entity3 and her father captain @entity4
he threw a protective arm around his daughter 's *shoulder* as they *walked*
captain @entity4 , *65* , is currently the chef @entity142 of the @entity71 eventing team
yesterday saw @entity2 enjoy a day out with @entity43 at @entity35
