@entity0 believes @entity1 and @entity2 should follow the lead of @entity4 and play in next summer 's @entity5 , should @entity6 qualify			1
@entity8 's @entity7 take on @entity9 in the first leg of their play - off at @entity12 on friday night and head into the match in fine form having won nine of their 10 group games			1
but former @entity6 and @entity19 midfielder @entity0 writes in his @entity21 column that there needs to be a culture change if @entity6 are to succeed at @entity25 level			2
@entity2 - man of the match against @entity28 - will be eligible to play for the @entity29 next summer @entity30 attacker @entity1 should also go the @entity5 , says @entity0 ' there are too many young players who , having made a senior debut , see a move to the @entity29 as a demotion , ' @entity0 argues			1
' @entity36 is a prime example			0
he went from the @entity38 to the senior team			0
then he was in the under 21s squad this week until the injury to @entity42 meant that he returned to the seniors			0
' i have no reason to doubt that @entity46 would have taken the @entity29 seriously			0
but if any player needs a reminder , they only have to look as far as @entity4			2
he was part of the @entity52 squad that won the @entity53 in 2010 in @entity54 and then went back to the under - 21s the following summer and won the @entity56			1
@entity19 playmaker @entity4 celebrates with the @entity53 trophy in 2010 @entity4 with his @entity59 award after helping @entity52 to the @entity5 title in @entity61 in 2011 @entity0 says that @entity36 ( above ) should not consider an under 21s call - up a demotion ' if it is good enough for @entity4 , why not @entity65 lads , too ? should @entity8 â€™s team make it to the tournament , i would advocate taking @entity1 and @entity2 to the tournament next summer , even though they are well - established in the senior team			1
' @entity0 highlights the counter-argument to his point ; namely that dropping players who had played in qualifiers for those who have n't would be inherently unfair			0
but he retorts : ' does the @entity78 want to win something ? if the answer is ' yes ' , then it is time to be ruthless about getting the best team on the pitch			0
' @entity0 played 66 times for @entity6 but never made an appearances for the @entity25 21s			2

@entity0 says an @entity6 under 21 call - up for a senior player such as @entity36 should n't be considered a demotion
@entity4 won the @entity5 with @entity52 the year after he had been part of their @entity53 - winning squad in @entity54
@entity2 and @entity1 eligible for @entity29 next summer
@entity0 says both should play if @entity6 qualify by beating @entity9
