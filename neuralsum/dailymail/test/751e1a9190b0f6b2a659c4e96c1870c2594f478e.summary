after @entity2 ’s speech in his former constituency of @entity4 last week , the former @entity0 made an appearance at a low - key private fundraising dinner for 15 @entity8 target seats			1
but despite the fact that @entity2 has a record of three general election victories , only one shadow cabinet minister , @entity12 , could be bothered to attend			1
during a dinner held in an @entity15 banquet hall in @entity16 , @entity2 ( pictured last week in @entity17 , @entity18 ) name - checked @entity19 only once , devoting his speech instead to his own achievements the dashing shadow business secretary is being mentored by @entity23 , the former @entity24 cabinet minister , who wants to see him as the next @entity8 leader			1
the programme for the dinner , held in an @entity15 banquet hall in less - than - glamorous @entity29 , @entity30 , was littered with errors and even misspelt @entity12 ’s name			1
a clearly uncomfortable @entity2 name - checked @entity19 only once , devoting his speech instead to his own achievements			1
bizarrely , @entity2 shared a stage with musician @entity35 , who won the first x factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than @entity2 ’s popularity			2
@entity35 ’s last record ( he had a box full of them to give away ) is an apt metaphor for @entity2 in the eyes of the current @entity44			2
one of many critics of @entity2 ’s appearance on the election trail was @entity50 , who is fighting to retain @entity51 for the @entity52			2
he said : ‘ @entity2 dripping with blood , pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice , comes out fighting for @entity8			2
’ @entity50 is one to talk			2
last year he earned £ 303,000 in addition to his mp ’s salary , mostly from £ 1,600 - an - hour appearances on @entity63 ’s @entity62 and @entity64			1
the national treasure that is @entity66 gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign			2
‘ there ’s this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life			0
to deal with it , big taxes have to go up			0
the @entity80 seem to have forgotten that , ’ he writes in @entity70			0
‘ they now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the @entity85 ; @entity8 has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters			0
the other parties want to spend more and do n’t want to talk about taxation			0
‘ the deficit ? apparently if it ’s left alone it ’s just going to melt away			0
huddled - down , risk - averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children			1
’ @entity96 brandished @entity8 's ' controls on @entity99 ' mug embarrassing @entity96 brandished @entity8 ’s embarrassing ‘ @entity104 ’ mug at the shadow home secretary @entity101 in her @entity103 interview yesterday			1
@entity105 coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras			0
‘ a storm in a coffee cup , ’ @entity105 , aka mrs @entity109 , said			1
the influential @entity113 blog says defence secretary @entity115 ’s claim that @entity118 ‘ stabbed his own brother in the back ’ to lead @entity8 , and would do the same to @entity119 by negotiating away @entity120 , will help the @entity80			0
‘ the manner in which @entity19 defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with @entity8 canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of @entity19 as an untrustworthy leader , ’ the website says			0
‘ the gutter is an ugly place to be but			0
it ’s where elections are won			0
’ @entity134 is under pressure to dump its candidate for @entity137 , @entity138 , for saying in 2001 @entity140 - born inhabitants of rural @entity141 were ‘ gun - toting final solution crackpots ’			1
in other words , nazis			0
@entity138 said he was ‘ young and angry at the time ’			0
gaffe of the day : @entity147 , @entity148 candidate in @entity8 - held @entity149 and @entity150 , posted pictures of litter on the streets to shame her political opponent — but they were from streets in neighbouring @entity156 , controlled by the @entity80 who are responsible for refuse collection			1
@entity160 's now a @entity148 pin - up spotted in @entity161 yesterday : @entity162 , the defending @entity148 mp , wearing a t - shirt and wrist watch emblazoned with the features of his political hero			1
not @entity168 but @entity160 , pictured , who announced her candidacy for the @entity171 presidential nomination			0
students of @entity174 history will know that yesterday was also the 70th anniversary of the death of @entity177 , @entity174 ’s longest - serving president , who was a @entity178			2
pin - up : @entity162 , @entity148 mp in @entity161 , was spotted wearing a t - shirt with @entity160 on the front			1

@ *highlight* an earlier version of this article wrongly referred to @entity149 and @entity150 's *conservative* *parliamentary* candidate mrs @entity147 posting pictures of litter in @entity188 to shame her political opponent . we are happy to *clarify* that the photos were in fact taken in @entity148 - controlled @entity156 and there was no intention to imply that mrs @entity147 was *unaware* of the constituency *boundaries* .
