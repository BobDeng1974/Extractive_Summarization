designer @entity0 has revealed how she managed to avoid falling prey to the stressful ' chaos ' of living and working in @entity4 , while creating three globally - successful fashion labels			1
in an interview with @entity8 , the 66 - year - old admits that , while @entity4 has helped to inspire and influence her clothing designs , the madness of city living can sometimes prove too much			1
speaking about her newly - launched clothing and accessories line @entity14 , which is targeted at an older audience than her popular dkny designs , @entity0 explains how she has slowed the pace of her own often - manic lifestyle and carved out her own peaceful sanctuary in the heart of @entity4			1
' because of the craziness of @entity4 , i started @entity14 to find the calm in the chaos of the city we live in and love			2
being down here , in this loft at @entity14 , is sort of an escape			0
' the new line entirely different from her @entity36 and @entity0 collections , both of which have proved to be incredibly popular the world over			2
but @entity14 marks a move away from more mainstream fashion , in favor of comfortable , yet chic , styles which are as suitable for a yoga class as they would be for a dinner date , and are a clear reflection of @entity0 's low - key lifestyle			1
' anything that i do n’t have to get dressed for , or put on make - up , i love , ' she jokes			0
when it comes to achieving the perfect lifestyle balance , @entity0 has learned to embrace those activities that she enjoys the most - specifically yoga and food			1
building an urban sanctuary : the 66 - year - old 's newest label @entity14 is targeted at a more ' yoga - minded ' woman ' i get up every morning and have my protein drink from @entity63 , ' she says			1
' in the afternoon i have to have soup and salad , usually a green soup			0
i also like green juices			0
i love @entity69 food , especially @entity70 and @entity71 ... ' i started doing yoga when i was eighteen years old , so i started at a very young age			0
it was something that i felt comfortable with			0
i love being on a mat ; i love having a teacher ; i love going inside , because i ’m constantly outside			0
' but while @entity0 has learned to find the perfect balance when it comes to city living , she suggests the ability can only come with years of experience , something which she feels is reflected in the attitudes and lifestyles of the different age groups each of her lines is targeted at			2
describing ' the @entity0 woman ' as someone who is constantly on the move , while working at an executive level position , @entity0 stresses that @entity36 's customers tend to be more young , urban people who are ' constantly looking for jobs '			2
park life : speaking about her home , which is next to one of @entity4 's green spaces , @entity0 confesses that if she is n't near nature , she ' gets really nasty ' when it comes to @entity14 , the label 's most devoted fans tend to be ' a little bit more yoga - minded ' and bohemian , with a strong focus on body and movement			1
speaking about her own lifestyle , @entity0 makes clear that she is leaning more towards the @entity14 way of living , describing yoga , something which she has been doing since the age of 18 , as one of her central focuses			2
@entity0 also stresses her love of nature and confesses that being close to an open , green space - in her case , a city park - helps her to find focus			1
' i live on the park , so in that sense , i make sure that i have nature around me , ' she says			0
' i have to be in nature , because if i ’m not i get really nasty			0

the 66 - year - old designer described @entity4 as her ' inspiration ' but admitted she finds the lifestyle incredibly *hectic*
@entity0 also confessed that if she is n't near nature , she ' gets nasty '
