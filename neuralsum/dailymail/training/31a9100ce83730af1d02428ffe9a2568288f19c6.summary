but an event person told him no outside food or beverage was permitted and that his bottle would be taken away if he continued to drink it the next image shows a police officer approaching the man in an orange cutoff shirt about the dark liquid			1
' the cop asked why he had it , and his response was that he was diabetic and his blood sugar was low , ' @entity23 told @entity55			2
that was a good enough reason for the cop , who left him alone , but not for the event organizers ' the cop said ok and walked away , about 5 minutes after a woman who worked for the arena came and told the dude they did n't allow outside food or beverage and that if she saw him drink it again she would have it taken away ' the guy put it away and started crying			2
' no tears : a @entity74 user claiming to be the pictured man maintains that he did not cry at the monster truck rally following @entity55 's story posted on friday , a man claiming to be the syrup - drinker emerged on @entity74 calling @entity23 out			0
he maintains that he did n't cry , and if he did it did n't have anything to do with the syrup scandal			0

the man was pictured at @entity13 last week in @entity6 , @entity1
according to a @entity11 user , the man was approached by cops who *thought* the bottle of dark liquid was hard alcohol
he then told the officer that it was syrup to control his low blood sugar
the officer left him alone but an event organizer told him no outside food or beverage was allowed and that he had to put it away
