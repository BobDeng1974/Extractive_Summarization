a couple of decades ago my late husband @entity0 , then chief executive of a tv company , and i , were dining with a group of television executives			0
when @entity0 momentarily left the table the man on my right — successful , educated , middle - aged — leered at me , groped my knee and announced : ‘ if ever you get bored with the old man you know where to come			1
’ i swatted him off like an irritating fly , told him sharply to get lost and pointedly ignored him for the rest of the evening			0
the man who goosed me was irksome , clearly drunk and daft enough not to recognise the implications of making an improper suggestion to his boss ’s wife			0
' women in @entity26 today are both privileged , high - achieving and in my view , quite capable of standing up for ourselves ' , says @entity27 however , i would argue that his fumble and ill - judged remark – although marking him out as boorish and stupid – did n’t make him sexist			1
to have made a fuss would have been to exaggerate my sense of grievance and , more pertinently , to demean women who had proper cause for complaint			1
that is why this week i found myself bridling at the comments of @entity41 special rapporteur @entity39 , a @entity42 expert on human rights looking at violence against women in the @entity26 , who had the temerity to accuse @entity26 of being more sexist than any other country in the world , due to our ‘ boys ’ club sexist culture ’			1
i have to take issue with her on many levels ; not least because women in @entity26 today are both privileged , high - achieving and in my view , quite capable of standing up for ourselves			1
indeed , not only are we shattering glass ceilings , we are also usurping men in top jobs and dominating many professions			1
@entity26 women are in the ascendancy			1
they do not need patronising initiatives on sexism			0
for the fact is , women in the @entity26 today have never had it so good			1
statistics from the @entity69 revealed last year around 20 universities in the country had twice as many female undergraduates as male			0
women students out - numbered men on many courses , most notably in veterinary science , medicine and education			1
last autumn , the total of male students enrolling for university fell , while women were a third more likely to take degree than their male counterparts			1
the proportion of women directors among the @entity90 companies rose to almost a quarter this year and this figure is set to grow			2
' today , i would suggest , women do not just have parity with men , actually we now have the advantage over them ' so the facts disprove ms @entity39 ’s contention : women are , in fact , the dominant sex in contemporary @entity26			1
despite this , the cry of feminists deriding our ‘ sexist ’ culture has never been louder			2
thanks to the po - faced ministrations of the sisterhood , we inhabit a dull , androgynous and increasingly humourless society in which men feel constrained from telling mother - in - law jokes for fear of being labelled a misogynist , and balk at complimenting women on their appearance in case they are cast as sex pests			1
in ms @entity125 ’s sterile , politically - correct world , men who wolf - whistle at women are part of an ‘ ingrained sexist culture ’			1
i ’m sure i will rankle the feminists when i say that , as a mother of two grown - up sons , i ’m heartily grateful for the odd whistle of approbation			2
neither do i feel demeaned by men who are civil enough to open doors for me , proffer their seats on trains or even comment favourably on my appearance			2
as i mentioned before , my husband @entity0 , who died in 2000 , was @entity138			0
the @entity138 have a long and ignoble tradition of making jokes at the expense of women			2
i ’ll cite an example to give you a flavour : how many men does it take to open a beer ? none			2
it should be opened by the time she brings it			0
yes , of course it is crass , but should the enlightened @entity156 be bothering to expend its energy and resources fighting such harmless sexism , when there are bigger battles to be won on behalf of genuinely oppressed women ? in the @entity26 , the @entity164 has enshrined in the law the notion of equal rights for women in the work place			1
today , i would suggest , women do not just have parity with men , actually we now have the advantage over them			1
and yet we have reached the point where the sexes are no longer permitted to celebrate their different skills and inherent aptitudes			0
@entity27 argues that when she was drunkenly groped by a male friend at a dinner party : ' his fumble and ill - judged remark - although marking him out as boorish and stupid - did n't make him sexist ' in some quarters , men and women are being melded into an amorphous @entity186 is now heresy to suggest that women have greater emotional intelligence , kindness or empathy than men ; that they are more adept at home - making and more skilled at raising children			1
the title ‘ housewife ’ has become pejorative			0
twenty - seven years ago i abandoned a well - paid and prestigious career in television — i was features editor on @entity199 — to be a full - time mum			2
i had not intended to relinquish work and , had employed a nanny to look after my first - born so i could race back to the studio , untrammelled , so i imagined , by guilt or regret , to pursue my career			2
but i had not reckoned with the sheer distress i felt at leaving my year - old baby in the care of someone else			2
i managed to work for 11 months , but i was so racked with sorrow and yearning , in the end i gave up to look after my son then remained a full - time mum when my second was born			2
when i met @entity217 at a reception and admitted sheepishly i was ‘ just a mum ’			0
she responded crisply that there was no ‘ just ’ about motherhood : raising the next generation was , she insisted , the most worthy and laudable of occupations			0
and it is this simple but self - evident truth that strident feminists overlook when they inveigh against sexism and campaign so blindly for equal opportunities			2
we women have infiltrated every area of professional life , and of course must celebrate our freedom to take jobs in which we can fulfil our potential we women have infiltrated every area of professional life , and of course must celebrate our freedom to take jobs in which we can fulfil our potential			0
but in the clamour for equality — to have equal numbers of female sports presenters and comediennes on tv and radio panel shows for example – — we have also overlooked the truism that men are actually better suited for some jobs than women			1
the opposite is also true			0
ms @entity39 shared her preliminary findings and asked : ‘ have i seen this level of sexist culture in other countries ? it has n’t been so in - your - face in other countries			1
i have n’t seen that so pervasively in other countries			0
’ yet in her @entity42 homeland , one woman , on average , is murdered by her partner every eight hours			0
there is a danger , too , in glibly blaming every ill on sexism			0
ms @entity125 attributes ‘ the easy availability of porn ’ to it			0
porn in my view has much more to do with our overly liberal society — for which women , quite as much men , are responsible — and the availability of technology to access it			1
so i argue for a better sense of proportion , and for a degree of levity to be injected into the debate			0
we brits are celebrated for our humour			0
it is up to each one of us to decide whether we are offended or not : by saucy seaside postcard cartoons , by mother - in - law gags , by wolf whistles ; even by crass and illiberal @entity295 jokes			0
and we should save our energy for the real battles and reserve our outrage and energies for women in oppressive regimes the world over who genuinely warrant our help			0
@entity305 is a research fellow at the @entity306			1

@entity305 believes women in the @entity26 are high - achieving and capable of standing up for ourselves
she believes men are blamed for being ' sexist ' when they are not
