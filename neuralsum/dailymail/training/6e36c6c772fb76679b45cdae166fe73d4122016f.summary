even when they ’re just a few days old , it ’s wise to take care with crocodiles			2
so this zookeeper kept fingers well out of the way as these rare @entity8 crocs were shown off at the @entity10 attraction in @entity11			1
eight were hatched in all , each with a set of teeth which can already deliver a sharp bite			2
the birth single - handedly boosted the world 's population of siamese crocodiles by almost 2 per cent , as the endangered species is rarer than the giant panda			1
crocodile breeder @entity32 launched the @entity11 tourist venue in 2011 by importing a 10ft male @entity8 crocodile named @entity35 and a female called @entity37 from zoos in @entity39 and @entity40			1
they paired up in spring this year , and a few weeks later staff saw @entity37 start to build a nest out of soil and bark chippings in her enclosure			2
she laid 16 fertile eggs which were very carefully taken from the nest by staff and placed in an incubator for the next 80 days			0
of the 16 large eggs , eight of them hatched over a four - day period			1
the other eight failed to hatch			0
just a few days old , the babies are now 10ins long and weigh 2oz each			0
rare : fewer than 500 @entity8 crocs are in the wild the baby crocs are being looked after by staff and fed a diet of insects such as locusts and crickets			1
this will progress to raw meat including chicken and beef in the next few weeks			0
they will be put into their own enclosure at the attraction but mr @entity32 hopes in the future they will be used to set up a breeding programme in @entity76 , home to the wild population of 500			1
@entity32 , 35 , said : ' siamese crocodiles are critically endangered , three times more endangered than the giant panda			1
' they are over-hunted for the illegal skin trade and they are suffering from habitat loss due to the building of hydroelectric dams			0
' they are so threatened that we wanted to give the eggs the best possible chance of hatching by incubating them in controlled conditions and a steady temperature of @entity96			0
' this is the first time this species has been bred in the @entity99			0
we are delighted that we have boosted their worldwide numbers			0
adult @entity8 crocodiles grow to 10ft in length and reach breeding age by seven years old			0
they often develop brightly - coloured patterns in their scales which makes them more striking than other species			1
they are also less aggressive , with attacks on humans more or less unheard of			0
to some their name may wrongly conjur images of ' @entity8 ' or conjoined twins - it simply refers to the part of the world from which they originate			2
mr @entity32 's business is home to 126 crocodiles and alligators from 14 species and attracts 30,000 visitors a year			1
the married father - of - three has always been fascinated by crocodiles and began keeping reptiles from the age of 15			2
after studying the husbandry of crocodiles , he began to keep them privately before selling his family home to build and open the zoo in 2011 .			1

birth has single - handedly *increased* the global population by 2 per cent
eight of the *animals* were born at @entity25 in @entity11
zoo was launched in 2011 by *enthusiast* and breeder @entity32
he hopes they will be used to boost last remaining wild crocs in @entity76
