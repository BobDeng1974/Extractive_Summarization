by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 26 october 2012 one ancient little girl : the skull of @entity3 , whose remains have now revealed that human ancestors remained tree - climbers for longer than thought analysis of the bones of a girl who died 3.3million years ago in @entity11 suggests our ancestors came down from the trees later than many scientists thought			2
the fossilised shoulder blades of @entity3 , a three - year - old unearthed in @entity17 , @entity18 , show features that suggest she and her family were able climbers - despite also being adapted for walking on the ground			1
@entity3 is a remarkably well - preserved example of @entity25 , thought to be an important forerunner of modern human beings			2
she is the same species as @entity29 , the famous 3.2million - year - old skeleton discovered in 1974			1
although a. afarensis was an upright walking species , the question of whether it also spent much of its time in trees has been hotly debated , partly because a complete set of shoulder blades has never before been available for investigation			1
lead researcher professor @entity40 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ' these remarkable fossils provide strong evidence that these individuals were still climbing at this stage in human evolution			0
' it took 11 years to painstakingly extract the paper - thin shoulder blades from the rest of @entity3 's skeleton , which was encased in sandstone in 2000 by @entity54 , a co-author of the study published in @entity56			1
dr @entity54 , curator of anthropology at the @entity57 , said finding shoulder blades intact and attached to a skeleton was ' like hitting the jackpot '			1
' because shoulder blades are paper - thin , they rarely fossilise - and when they do , they are almost always fragmentary , ' he said			1
' this study moves us a step closer toward answering the question " when did our ancestors abandon climbing behaviour ? " , ' he added			0
' it appears that this happened much later than many researchers had previously suggested			0
' rare find : it took 11 years to painstakingly extract the paper - thin shoulder blades from the rest of @entity3 's skeleton , which was found encased in sandstone in 2000 by @entity54 @entity3 was a three - year - old a. afarensis girl whose skeleton is the most complete of her kind yet discovered			1
after freeing her shoulder blades from the surrounding rock , the researchers digitised then and took detailed measurements which they compared with other early human relatives as well as modern great apes and humans			1
analysis of the shape and function of the bones revealed a partially tree - living lifestyle			0
at the same time , the hip , lower leg and foot were human - like and adapted for upright walking			0
field work : dr @entity97 ( right ) working in the field in @entity17 , @entity18 , where @entity3 's skeleton was uncovered ' human scapulae change shape throughout ontogeny in a significantly different manner than closely related apes , " said dr @entity40			2
' when we compared @entity3 's scapula with adult members of @entity25 , it was clear that the pattern of growth was more consistent with that of apes than humans			0
' dr @entity54 added : ' this new find confirms the pivotal place that @entity29 and @entity3 's species occupies in human evolution			2
' while bipedal like humans , a. afarensis was still a capable climber			0
though not fully human , a. afarensis was clearly on its way			0

fossilised shoulder blades of three - year - old @entity25 from @entity18 show her kind were still adapted for tree climbing
she is of the same species as @entity29 , the famous 3.2million year old skeleton discovered in partial form in 1974
