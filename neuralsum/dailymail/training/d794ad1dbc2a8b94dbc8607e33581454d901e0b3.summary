in a forceful appeal for international cooperation on limiting carbon pollution , president @entity0 alerted world leaders on tuesday that the globe 's climate is changing faster than efforts to address it			1
' nobody gets a pass , ' he declared			0
' we have to raise our collective ambition			0
' speaking at a @entity14 summit , @entity0 said the @entity15 is doing its part and that it will meet its goal to cut carbon pollution 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020			1
he also announced modest new @entity15 commitments to address climate change overseas			2
the summit aims to galvanize support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year			1
' the alarm bells keep ringing , our citizens keep marching , ' he said			0
' we ca n't pretend we ca n't hear them			0
we need to answer the call			0
' we need to cut carbon emission in our countries to prevent worse effects , adapt and work together as global community to tackle this global threat before it is too late , ' he argued			1
@entity0 said the @entity15 and @entity47 as the largest polluters have a responsibility to lead			2
but , @entity0 added , ' no nation can meet this global threat alone			1
' more than 120 world leaders gathered on the sidelines of the @entity53 to organize support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year in @entity56			1
@entity14 @entity57 ban ki - moon , the summit 's host , asked representatives of nations to come to @entity61 with specific pledges in hand to mitigate climate change , as a way to show they 're serious about ambitious emissions reductions in the treaty			1
@entity0 's goals at the summit : to convince other nations that the @entity15 is doing its part to curb greenhouse gases , and make the case that other major polluters should step up , too			1
' it 's very clear to the international community that the president is extending considerable political capital at home in order to implement his climate plan , and that 's true , ' said @entity83 , a @entity15 climate negotiator in the administrations of presidents @entity86 and @entity88			2
' the hope is that when we take action , others will do so as well , ' @entity83 said			0
@entity0 addressed the issue as part of the @entity14 's climate summit , which was called by @entity96 ban ki - moon			1
more than 120 world leaders convened for the meeting aimed at galvanizing political will for a new global climate treaty by the end of 2015 demonstrators make their way down @entity103 in @entity61 during the @entity105 's @entity104 on sunday			1
the march , along with similar gatherings scheduled in other cities worldwide , was purposefully scheduled two days before the @entity14 's climate event some of the tools the @entity15 will offer developing nations were developed by @entity112 and the @entity113 and are intended to help communities use data modeling , forecasting and science to anticipate the effects of climate change and make decisions about the best way to deal with it			1
secretary of state @entity122 also announced that the @entity15 would contribute $ 15 million to a @entity124 program designed to stimulate funding for projects that reduce methane pollution			2
but the commitments were modest compared to what some had hoped the @entity15 would put forth to show its commitment			2
by mid-morning , other nations attending the summit had pledged at least $ 5 billion to help the world become more sustainable			0
and the development organization @entity134 argued that the @entity135 already incorporates climate change resiliency in its programs			2
the one - day climate summit is n't formally part of the ongoing negotiations toward the climate treaty , which leaders hope will be more muscular than a lackluster agreement reached in @entity144 in 2009			1
the idea is that by involving heads of state early , rather than leaving it to negotiators until the very end , prospects will improve for reaching a strong deal			0
@entity122 attempted to put additional pressure on world leaders on monday while giving remarks at @entity61 's @entity156 kick - off event			0
calling climate change an ' international security challenge , ' @entity122 contended that it ' ranks right up there ' with poverty and terrorism			0
' you can make a powerful argument that it may be , in fact , the most serious challenge we face on the planet because it â€™s about the planet itself , ' @entity122 argued			0
approximately 100,000 of activists , including prominent actors and former vice president @entity172 , sought to bring national attention to the issue through a demonstration in @entity61 on sunday ahead of the @entity14 summit			2
the @entity14 secretary general , @entity178 , and @entity61 mayor @entity179 even joined the march , which stretched across two miles of @entity181			1
similar protests also took place in @entity184 , @entity185 ; @entity186 , @entity187 ; @entity189 , @entity190 ; and @entity191 and @entity192 , @entity188 on sunday			0
@entity193 announced his own city 's plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050 at the @entity61 event			1
' climate change is an existential threat to @entity61 and our planet , ' de @entity179 said			0
' @entity203 now is nothing short of a moral imperative			0
