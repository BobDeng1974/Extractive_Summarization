by @entity1 reporter published : 12:44 est , 30 september 2012 updated : 12:44 est , 30 september 2012 as the real referees are welcomed back to the @entity5 with open arms , one of the dismissed replacements has admitted that they may not have been ready for the job			1
@entity8 , a banker from @entity9 who has worked in college football for three decades , was one of the most experienced of the replacements			0
but during an interview published on friday , mr @entity8 questioned the experience of his colleagues as they jumped up from various levels of college football			0
' as for moments like the hotly disputed call that had one referee calling touchdown and another calling interception last monday night , mr @entity8 said the @entity5 was getting what it paid for			1
he told the magazine : ' we were pawns			0
this really became a business deal … this was [ the @entity5 's ] choice			2
they chose to take this position in the negotiation with the union			0
' but despite his lack of @entity5 experience , mr @entity8 accepted what he believed to be the chance of a lifetime			0
botched : the referee on the left , @entity49 , called the play a touchdown for @entity53 , even though most fans believe @entity55 had intercepted the ball			1
the ref on the right called for a stoppage of play he told @entity22 : ' if i had n't done it , somebody else would have			0
we did the best we could			0
' the league 's referees took the field on thursday night to a standing ovation from fans after the labor dispute was resolved			1
also last week , the @entity5 replacement ref who signaled a touchdown on the final play of monday night 's @entity55 - @entity74 game said he stands by his controversial decision which allowed the @entity74 to win 14 - 12			1
@entity49 , a banker from @entity76 whose controversial decision is believed to be the event that sparked the resolution , is adamant he made the correct call			1
' i do n’t appreciate the negative stuff , ' said @entity49 , who feels that he ’s had to shoulder the blame for monday night 's decision			1
scapegoat : @entity49 claims that he did n't do anything wrong ' i did n't do anything wrong , ' @entity49 told @entity87			1
' put any other official who knows the rules and they would make the same call			1
' @entity49 said the @entity55 player who allegedly intercepted the ball never had singular possession because , ' you have to not only have the ball but have either two feet or a body part on the ground , and that never happened			1
' although the @entity5 rulebook cites simultaneous possession is awarded to the passing team , @entity55 cornerback @entity99 clearly came away with the ball prior to @entity74 wide receiver @entity104 , who stripped the ball away as he was tangled with @entity99			1
@entity49 , who normally refs at @entity106 and @entity107 as well as @entity108 , all in @entity76 , said the replacement refs did what they were expected to do			1
' we did a damn good job ... for the most part			0
' his controversial call followed months of an intense labor lockout between the @entity5 and @entity117 , who finally came to an eight - year agreement on thursday morning			1
the stalemate , which saw the @entity5 's referees locked out since the beginning for the pre-season , had been whittled down to disagreements over ' a little money			2
' the real refs returned to the field to officiate thursday night 's game between the @entity129 and the @entity130			1
referee @entity131 and his seven - man crew received a standing ovation as they walked on the field in their familiar stripes for the first game of @entity137			2
one fan held up a sign that read : ' finally ! we get to yell at real refs ! welcome back ! ' ' the other refs just made dumb calls , ' said @entity144 , a 15 - year - old fan wearing an @entity146 jersey			1
' i could n't stand them			0
now we wo n't get robbed ; everything will be fair - hopefully			2
' the officials ran a mostly smooth and efficient first game back , with no headline - making calls as the @entity130 beat the @entity129 23 - 16			1
welcome back : a @entity130 fan holds a sign supporting the return of the real refs prior to the game against the @entity129 ready for action : referee @entity131 , right , and back judge @entity158 , left , look around the field before the game between the @entity130 and @entity129 @entity5 commissioner @entity161 acknowledged that monday night ’s disputed touchdown ' may have pushed the parties further along ' in the talks			1
' obviously when you go through something like this it is painful for everybody , ' @entity161 said			0
' most importantly , it is painful for our fans			0
we are sorry to have to put our fans through that , but it is something that in the short term you sometimes have to do to make sure you get the right kind of deal for the long term and make sure you continue to grow the game			2
' the deal is only tentative - it must be ratified by 51 percent of the union 's 121 members in a vote scheduled for friday and saturday in @entity185			2
the lockout ended after marathon negotiations produced an eight - year agreement to end the lockout that began in june			0
however , for the @entity55 , @entity191 , @entity192 and other teams who voiced their displeasure with calls that might have swayed games , the agreement does n't change their records			2
unwanted fame : @entity49 gestures on the field following his controversial call in the @entity74 ' 14 - 12 victory over the @entity55 the commissioner said he watched monday night 's frenetic @entity55 - @entity74 finish at home			1
' you never want to see a game end like that , ' he said			0
the new agreement will improve officiating in the future , @entity161 asserted , reducing mistakes like those made monday and making the strains of the last three weeks worthwhile			2
@entity161 acknowledged ' you 're always worried ' about the perception of the league			0
' obviously , this has gotten a lot of attention , ' he said			0
' it has n't been positive , and it 's something that you have to fight through and get to the long term			0
... we always are going to have to work harder to make sure we get people 's trust and confidence in us			0
' the dispute even made its way to the campaign trail , with president @entity230 's spokesman , @entity229 , calling thursday ' a great day for @entity231			2
' ' the president 's very pleased that the two sides have come together , ' @entity229 said .			0
