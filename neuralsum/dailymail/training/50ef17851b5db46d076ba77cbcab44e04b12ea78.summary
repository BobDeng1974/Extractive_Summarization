by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 16 may 2013 groundwater found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface of @entity4 may predate the emergence of multicellular life , researchers announced today			1
a joint @entity8 and @entity4 team discovered the ancient pockets of water , which they say are like ' trapped time capsules ' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years			1
it could be some of the oldest water on the planet and may even contain life , the researchers claim , as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight			2
billion year old sparkling water : showing collection of ancient water and gas in a mine nearly two miles beneath the surface of @entity29 , @entity4 , that may be almost half as old as the @entity30 itself more exciting still , the similarity between the rocks that trapped it and those on @entity36 raises the hope that comparable life sustaining water could be locked deep beneath the surface of the @entity36			1
researchers from the universities of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 analysed the water which poured out of boreholes in a mine 7,875ft beneath @entity29 , @entity4			2
' these are like trapped time capsules , ' said @entity51 , a geochemist at the @entity53			1
' they may tell us about the atmosphere 2.7 billion years ago , and about the fluids that formed the valuable ore deposits that are the foundation of @entity4 ’s mineral wealth			1
' geochemical reactions with the rocks means the water contains dissolved hydrogen and methane , as well as noble gases like helium , neon , argon and xenon , that have been trapped since early in @entity30 ’s history			2
these gases could provide energy for microbes that may not have been exposed to the sun for billions of years , the researchers say			0
project leader @entity76 , of the @entity43 , said : ' our finding is of huge interest to researchers who want to understand how microbes evolve in isolation , and is central to the whole question of the origin of life , the sustainability of life , and life in extreme environments and on other planets			0
' using ground - breaking techniques developed at the @entity43 , the researchers say they have shown that the fluid is at least 1.5 billion years old , but could be significantly older			1
it could even date back to the formation of the crystalline rocks surrounding the water , which are thought to be around 2.7billion years old - about half as old as the planet earth itself			1
before this finding , the only water of this age was found trapped in tiny bubbles of rock , but the water found in the @entity4 mine on the other hand pours from the rock at a rate of nearly two litres per minute			2
it has similar characteristics to far younger water flowing from a mine 1.7 miles below ground in @entity114 that was previously found to support microbes			2
buried life ? gas that bubbles out of the floor in the deep mine has a chemical composition that could provide the food source for microbes living in the deep ancient fluids totally in the absence of sunlight dr @entity126 of @entity127 said : ' our @entity4 colleagues are trying to find out if the water contains life right now			1
' what we can be sure of is that we have identified a way in which planets can create and preserve an environment friendly to microbial life for billions of years			0
' large regions of @entity36 are made up of terrain like that of the @entity30 ’s @entity140 – billions of years - old rocks with similar mineralogy			1
professor @entity143 said : ' the ancient waters of the @entity140 contain abundant chemicals that we know microbes can use as energy in the absence of sunlight - driven photosynthesis			0
' this shows that ancient rocks have the potential to support life and this could be the case whether they are three kilometres below the @entity30 ’s surface or below the surface of @entity36			1
' the @entity140 discovery pushes the age of water much farther back than the @entity114 discovery , identifying a groundwater system isolated from the surface for billions , rather than tens of millions of years			0
' our discovery establishes that ancient fluids , hitherto thought to have survived only in microscopic fluid inclusions trapped in the rocks , may instead still flow from ancient fractures , ' said professor @entity143			0
professor @entity76 , who is based in @entity43 ’s @entity170 , added : ' while the questions about life on @entity36 raised by our work are incredibly exciting , the ground - breaking techniques we have developed at @entity43 to date ancient waters also provide a way to calculate how fast methane gas is produced in ancient rock systems globally			1
' the same new techniques can be applied to characterise old , deep groundwater that may be a safe place to inject carbon dioxide			0
' @entity183 , minister for universities and science , sais : ' this is excellent pioneering research			0
it gives new insight into our planet			0
' it has also developed new technology for carbon capture and storage projects			0
these have the potential for growth , job creation and our environment			0
' the findings were published today in the journal @entity201 .			0

ancient pockets of water are like ' trapped time capsules ' cut off from the surface for nearly three billion years , researchers say
the similarity between the rocks in the mine and those on @entity36 raises the hope that similar life - sustaining water could exist there
