@entity0 is considering setting aside his reluctance to box on @entity4 's undercard so he can seek revenge against the fighter whose drug - fuelled victory put the skids under his career for a couple of years			1
@entity11 , who was gifted a scandalous home - town decision over @entity0 , was found later to have been on steroids that dodgy night in @entity14			1
that revelation came as @entity11 tested positive during the build up to their re-match			2
that door has been opened by @entity11 signing a management deal with @entity36 , the secretive svengali to a galaxy of star fighters , @entity4 among them			1
@entity36 works closely with @entity40 , whose stable includes @entity0 and who also organise @entity4 ’s big shows			1
even more significantly , now , @entity36 is believed to be in talks with @entity0 about his future			2
@entity0 remains hungry to avenge the @entity11 robbery and the re-match would appear to be a natural at this point in time			1
@entity51 ’s still - young , former two - time world champion is indicating that he will return to the ring on may 3 – the night he should have been fighting @entity4 in @entity25 in the richest bout ever contested by a @entity55 boxer			2
@entity4 suddenly switched to @entity56 , then urged @entity0 to fight his protégé @entity57 on that bill to prove he deserves a september bout against the world ’s best pound - for - pound boxer			1
not unnaturally , since one promise had been broken already , @entity0 was unconvinced			2
however , he explored the @entity57 possibility but then reported : ‘ he does n’t want the fight			0
’ the @entity11 connection brings the option of an opponent @entity0 knows he is capable of beating , especially under conditions of rigorous drug testing			1
devastating : @entity0 lost a controversial decision to @entity11 in 2011 but could be in line for a rematch doubts : @entity0 was twice deducted a point for pushing during his fight with @entity11 @entity0 says : ‘ it looks like i will be back on may 3 and it might be a good idea to keep in @entity4 ’s face as the chief support on his card			1
do n’t get me wrong , @entity4 ’s a great fighter			2
probably the best of his era			0
but as he gets older he might need pressing to take on a younger , explosive fighter like me with real speed			0
’ @entity88 and @entity89 are among other candidates for @entity0 ’s first fight in almost a year spent waiting on @entity4			1
but @entity11 is emerging as the favourite			2
the light - welterweight belt which the @entity94 allowed him to keep despite the failed drugs test would not be on the line			0
@entity11 would move up to welterweight , where @entity0 needs a convincing win to prove himself a worthy challenger for @entity4 ’s title			1
however , the history of controversy between @entity0 and @entity11 would make for a fascinating box - office fight in its own right			1
main main : @entity0 looks set to fight on the undercard of @entity4 's fight with @entity56 on may 3 as promoter @entity109 shrewdly manoeuvres either @entity21 or @entity22 towards a big money shot at @entity111 , the hottest of all the heavyweight prospects is closing fast on the next available world title			1
@entity21 and @entity22 are heading for a domestic collision this summer in a final eliminator for one of the younger @entity111 ’s collection of belts			2
meanwhile @entity119 , the @entity120 knock - out artist who has yet to be taken beyond the fourth round , has already become the challenger - in - waiting for the @entity124 crown , which has been left vacant by @entity125 as he fights the far greater battle for the future of @entity128			0
@entity119 stepped yet more heavily on the gas on saturday with a first - round flattening of @entity131 , to take his professional record to 31 straight @entity133			2
that positions the @entity135 from @entity136 to take on the winner of the up - coming @entity124 title fight between @entity139 and @entity140 , of whom he says : ‘ i could knock both those two out on the same night			0
’ it 's on : @entity21 ( right ) will take on @entity22 ( left ) for a shot at world champion @entity111 rematch : @entity21 will be looking for a repeat of his points victory over @entity22 in @entity147 three years ago @entity109 , who had been contemplating one more warm - up fight each for @entity21 and @entity22 next month , is now fast - tracking them to their @entity151 eliminator			1
@entity152 , who has a routine defence of all his titles in april , might then be pinned down to fight the winning @entity155 before the end of the year			0
should either @entity22 or @entity21 prove capable of ending @entity111 ’s seemingly ever - lasting run as multiple champion that should set up , in turn , a unification mega-bout with @entity119 next spring			1
@entity119 appears open to that proposition			0
remembering his quick stoppage of @entity164 in @entity165 last year , he says : ‘ i would be happy to cross the @entity166 again			0
not only do i know i would beat either of them but i love going to @entity27			0
’ he spices the prospect further by adding : ‘ as for @entity21 , he ’s a joke of a heavyweight			0
a cavalier traveller fury may be but he is even bigger than you and punches almost as hard			0
and , by the way , the reborn @entity22 is a more dedicated , determined and dangerous fighter than the reluctant heavyweight who was knocked out by @entity175			0
game over : @entity119 continued his stunning run of knockouts with a first - round stoppage of @entity131 down and out : @entity131 lasted for a little more than 90 seconds against the unbeaten @entity119 in @entity180 @entity181 was born @entity181 but changed his moniker to that of the boxer played by @entity185 in a movie			0
on saturday , in his home town of @entity165 , the @entity187 has the chance to start making a name for himself			0
@entity181 takes on former @entity192 champion @entity191 at the @entity193 in a bid to become the @entity196 super-bantamweight champion			1
he does so 20 years on from the night prince @entity197 won that same title , in the same arena , and he says : ’ i ’m looking to do an even better job than @entity197 did on @entity202			0
‘ that means i will have to be unbelievably good and take this guy apart			0
’ if he can deliver a performance of that quality , the kid will propel himself towards @entity208 and @entity209 in the echelon of @entity55 world title contenders at super-bantamweight			2
one to watch : @entity181 ( left ) bids to win the @entity196 title against @entity191 in @entity165			1

@entity0 could face @entity11 on @entity4 's undercard on may 3
@entity11 's word title would not be on the line
@entity119 wants to face @entity22 or @entity21 in @entity27
kid @entity223 bids to win the @entity196 super-bantamweight title on saturday
