@entity0 's is being sued over claims a painting it sold for £ 42,000 was actually a £ 10million @entity4			1
the bitter legal battle was sparked by @entity6 , whose family bought the work for a reputed £ 140 in 1962 and kept it for almost half a century until its sale in 2006			2
renowned collector sir @entity11 bought it at auction , where it was advertised as an imitator 's version of @entity4 's masterpiece @entity17			2
since the claim by sir @entity11 , who died aged 100 three years ago , mr @entity38 has been building a hugely expensive legal case against the auction giant - which is resolutely standing by its experts			1
some of the world 's most eminent @entity4 scholars will give evidence at a @entity23 trial which started this morning			1
as the trial opened , judge @entity47 was taken through a ' spot the difference ' exercise between the two pieces			0
@entity51 , representing mr @entity38 , said : ' it is easy when one is looking at these paintings to regard issues of attribution as a painting competition and we assume , naturally , that he was very good at painting			2
' it is not merely a question of which painting is better , but distinguishing which painting shares characteristics of @entity4			0
anger : @entity38 , who sold the work for just £ 42,000 , arrives at the @entity23 for the hearing ' it is easy to fall into the fallacy of thinking " it 's a famous painter - it 's painted well			1
" that 's not how attribution works			0
' mr @entity38 ' claim said the painting was an early version by @entity4 of his work @entity17 - one of his masterpieces			1
the original hangs in the @entity29 in @entity30 and shows a young man falling victim to a pair of cheats at a card game			0
it is one of only 50 or so works by @entity4 , one of the masters of his age , which survive to this day			0
mr @entity38 claimed experts for @entity0 's did not consult widely enough before the sale of the painting - which is now hanging in the @entity93 in @entity94 - in december 2006			1
he said that he only decided to sell the painting when he was told it was a 17th century copy			0
in documents submitted to the @entity23 , mr @entity38 's lawyers criticised the auction house for negligence claiming they failed to carry out proper tests and consult experts			1
in a skeleton argument they said : ' @entity0 is responsible for all the foreseeable loss which is a consequence of mr @entity38 having acted on that advice			1
' [ the ] evidence is that had the painting been sold at auction in 2006 ... it would have achieved £ 11m			1
' however , a later sale by private treaty might have achieved a higher price than £ 11m			0
' mr @entity113 told the court : ' this case at its core is a very simple story			0
' mr @entity38 had a picture which he thought might be by @entity4 [ so ] he sent it to @entity0 's for research			1
' @entity0 looked at it and they told him that the painting was n't by @entity4 , but they had n't done the tests that he had asked them to do			2
' they came back to him and said they had done the x-rays on the painting and said it was n't @entity4 , but they did n't do infra - red imaging			0
' when it was sold the new owner had it cleaned and submitted it to the tests , including infra - red and it was subsequently attributed to @entity4			2
@entity137 master : only 50 or so works survive by @entity4 ( left ) , one of the masters of his age			1
right : the original listing in the auction house catalogue by @entity0 's when the painting was sold in december 2006 ' at the core this is a negligence case , it is about @entity0 's actions and not attribution			1
' when the @entity93 acquired the work on loan earlier this year , it told journalists : ' in 2006 , sir @entity11 discovered another version of @entity17 , virtually identical to the @entity156 picture			0
' after exhaustive study and scientific analysis , sir @entity11 concluded that this was an earlier version , also painted for @entity161			0
' the attribution was also supported by other leading @entity4 scholars , such as @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity168 @entity167 , and others			0
' but @entity0 's is fiercely contesting the claim - and calling renowned experts to give evidence on their behalf			1
they will include @entity4 scholar sir @entity174 , who supports the auction house 's stance			1
the auction house said in its @entity23 statement , seen by @entity179 : ' the painting is not by @entity4 and is clearly inferior in quality to the universally acknowledged original in the @entity29			1
respected : the work was bought and declared a real @entity4 by collector sir @entity11 ( pictured ) ' there is a vast difference in quality between the @entity187 and the painting at issue			0
' the @entity187 was painted by @entity4 with the striking virtuosity and realism for which his early works are famous			0
the quality of execution on display in the painting falls far short of the @entity156 original			2
' our experts were entirely competent to make this assessment and even if they had carried out further investigation , this would just have confirmed their view that the painting is an anonymous copy			0
' none of the leading scholars who have opined on the painting since @entity11 acquired it think that it is by @entity4			0
' the auction house claimed one of mr @entity212 's experts is an ' administrator ' who specialises in the @entity213 and not the baroque period , while another two are ' restorers without qualifications in art history '			1
' none of these individuals are " leading @entity4 scholars '' ' , the auction house said			2
the statement added mr @entity38 could have sought his own experts at the time of the sale			2
@entity0 's claim that despite the painting now being regarded by some as a genuine @entity4 , no leading expert has confirmed it as the master 's work			1
mr @entity38 could not be reached for comment			0
the hearing , which is expected to last three weeks , continues .			0

painting sold in 2006 was attributed to a *follower* of the @entity137 master
but buyer now says it is a £ 10m original , @entity23 papers claim
seller @entity38 is now suing the auction house over the *row*
@entity0 's deny *allegation* and insist painting is ' clearly inferior in quality '
world - class experts will give evidence at month - long trial starting today
