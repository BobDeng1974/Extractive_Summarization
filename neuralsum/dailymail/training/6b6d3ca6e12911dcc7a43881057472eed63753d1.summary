the @entity0 were meant to be a celebration of the @entity3 ' history , as the spiritual home of @entity3 sport hosted the world in the @entity7			0
the @entity8 poured around € 9billion ( £ 7.13billion ) into building new stadiums and infrastructure , and despite disputes and delays in the run - up to the event , put on a successful games			0
however , a decade on , the stands lie empty , completely unused and allowed to fall into disrepair , as the global economic crisis meant the country 's government were unable to invest in the upkeep of the @entity3 venues			0
nothing left : a swimming pool from the @entity3 village is filled with dirty rainwater and debris a decade after the @entity29 games contrast : @entity29 ' open - air pool during the @entity0 , when it saw @entity32 win six gold medals and break two @entity34 welcome home : the @entity3 ' motto is one of the few remains left standing in an olympic park that has almost entirely fallen into disrepair empty : the diving venue , where @entity41 and @entity42 won silver for @entity44 , is now in a sorry state in the @entity8 capital deserted village : the @entity3 village that hosted the athletes just ten years ago is now a desolate wasteland covered in graffiti falling down : paint peeling , seats ripped out and benches collapsing , the aquatic centre is a shadow of its former self life 's a beach : the stand built to house beach volleyball is still standing , but the sand in front of it is overgrown with plants as it was : the @entity3 beach volleyball stadium , complete with extra temporary stands , as it stood during the 2004 games @entity70 1 @entity71 36 39 26 2 @entity72 32 17 143 @entity73 28 26 36 4 @entity74 17 16 175 @entity75 16 9 12 6 @entity76 13 16 20 7 @entity77 11 9 13 8 @entity78 10 11 11 9 @entity79 9 12 9 10 @entity80 9 9 12 @entity44 won nine gold medals during the competition , among which the most memorable were middle - distance runner @entity84 ' 800m and 1500m double			1
in the velodrome sir @entity86 and sir @entity87 each won their first @entity3 golds as @entity80 recorded their best medal haul in the modern era			2
the mens 4x100m relay team of @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 won gold on the track as the @entity102 quartet saw off an @entity71 team which included newly crowed individual @entity3 champion @entity104			2
it was also the games that launched boxer @entity107 into the limelight , his silver medal in the lightweight division leading to a professional career , while elsewhere in @entity29 a 19 - year - old @entity32 won the first six of his record 22 gold medals in the pool , setting two @entity34 in the process			1
the games were not without their controversy - most notably when home favourites @entity118 and @entity120 pulled out of the championships after missing a doping test			0
remains : this is all that 's left of the @entity127 and @entity128 centre where @entity44 picked up one silver and two bronze medals back then : @entity80 's @entity131 competes in the final of @entity3 men 's @entity134 race in the @entity137 complex , where he won a silver medal torn apart : the @entity141 stadium is now little more than an overgrown field with a broken big screen , surrounded by unused seats home run : the baseball stadium as it stood in 2004 - now it is an overgrown ruin @entity149 : the canoe and kayak course was still full of water a year after the games			1
today it is completely dry , another relic of the 9bn olympics all dried up : the @entity157 , which included the canoeing course and the baseball stadium , now lies deserted but despite the shame of their celebrated athletes , the astronomical cost , and the building difficulties which threatened the games even before they started , the @entity0 were seen as a success both in @entity8 and internationally			0
however , @entity8 was hit hard by the global financial crisis and , with no real post-games plan , the state - of - the - art venues were abandoned			0
ten years on , they are the sad legacy of the event that was supposed to welcome the @entity3 home			1
load of rubbish : the swimming pool that once hosted international athletes has now become a rubbish dump in @entity29 no village people : what was once a luxury hub for the summer games is now a deserted shell in an overgrown wasteland what 's the score ? the seats are still in place at the @entity189 but the broken score - board tells its own story all over : the beach volleyball venue is no longer used , another of the @entity3 venues that has been allowed to fall by the wayside in use : the beach volleyball stadium has fallen entirely out of use since the end of the games ten years ago no one left : the derelict stands of the @entity141 stadium are a symbol of the games ' decay as economic hardship prevented @entity8 from maintaining their venues broken down : the @entity209 is still standing , but the roads outside are covered in rubble and the venue itself is fenced off to visitors ruins : parts of the @entity217 in @entity29 are entirely unrecognisable from the slick venues that the world saw a decade ago			1

@entity3 legacy almost *non-existant* with stadiums falling into disrepair
@entity29 motto was ' welcome home ' but ten years later there is little to show for the games
@entity80 won nine gold medals in 2004 , their best *performance* - at the time - for several decades
