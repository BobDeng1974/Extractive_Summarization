by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:36 am on 7th october 2011 an @entity3 - funded theatre company has been criticised after appealing to rioters in prison to ' give their side of the story '			1
the @entity8 wrote to @entity9 , the prisoners ' magazine , asking for inmates to share their ' direct experiences ' of the civil disorder that swept the country in august			1
in the letters page of the magazine - which is read by an estimated 50,000 prisoners - @entity18 , associate producer of the company , says the play , called the riots , needs convicts ' input			1
their side of the story : a youth walks past a burning vehicle in @entity27 during the august riots			0
jailed rioters have been invited to contribute to a new play the 24 - year - old @entity32 drama graduate said : ' we would like to hear your direct experiences and opinions , and we would then hope to put them on stage , word - for - word			1
' this is an opportunity to have your voice heard on a national platform , and you can choose to be anonymous if you would rather			0
' any thoughts , personal observations , views on the sentencing , or the police response , will be extremely useful to this project - we want to hear as many different views as possible			1
' ' @entity50 ' : the @entity8 in @entity51 , north @entity52 , has asked jailed rioters to contribute to its latest production the @entity54 has a record for attacking the ' establishment ' and has in the past put on plays criticising the war in @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
in 2007 the company produced a play called ' called to @entity65 - the indictment of @entity67 for the crime of aggression against @entity60 - a hearing '			1
a prison source , speaking yesterday , said the request by the @entity73 would ' not be appreciated ' by prison staff			0
' for this theatre company to effectively give these people a voice is not something that we in the prison service will appreciate			0
' these people made life hell for countless thousands of people across the whole of the @entity84 and for them to be asked to give their opinions on the riots is like asking a murderer to try and explain to the family of the victim why they killed him			0
' it is insensitive and basically lets these people who have looted and damaged shops , cars and people 's property gain what they might see as ' respect ' for what they have done			0
' the @entity8 received £ 725,315 from the @entity3 - a non departmental public body run by the @entity100 - in april this year			1
the play - due to be shown at the group 's 235 - seat theatre in @entity51 , north @entity52 , from november 17 until december 10 - hopes to build a ' real - time picture of the riots as they unfolded '			2
on the theatre company 's website it states : ' the government has so far refused a @entity110 into the riots that shook our cities this summer , so the @entity54 is mounting its own			0
destruction : council cleaners sweep away the rubbish left behind after looters swept through @entity118 , south - west @entity52 ' from tweets by taxi drivers , to moment - by - moment accounts by riot police , it will build a real - time picture of the riots as they unfolded			2
' and then , from interviews with politicians , police , teachers , lawyers , community leaders , as well as victims and on - lookers , the riots will analyse what happened , why it happened , and what we should do towards making a better future for ourselves and our city			2
' @entity140 stories and equally astonishing conclusions told by the many voices that have been stirred up by the riots			2
' tickets cost £ 13 .			0

@entity8 , funded by @entity3 , says it will use prisoners ' stories ' word - for - word '
