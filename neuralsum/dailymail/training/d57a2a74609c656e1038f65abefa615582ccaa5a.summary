by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 all eyes are on @entity4 on wednesday night as the @entity5 look to progress to the @entity8 group stages yet again			1
standing in their way at the @entity11 will be @entity12 , who are by no means out of the tie after a 0 - 0 in the first leg in @entity16			1
we all know about former @entity18 and @entity20 striker @entity19 , but here @entity21 looks at three other stars who could trouble the @entity5			1
operating in the hole just behind the striker , the youngster picked passes intelligently and found space to worry @entity47			2
looking at his technical style , its no wonder the @entity49 - born playmaker used to ply his trade in @entity53			1
@entity34 came through the ranks under @entity30 , but managed just one @entity56 substitute appearance with the @entity5 well stocked in his position			1
@entity30 allowed him to jump ship , and admitted he was happy to see the youngster progress			2
talent : 21 - year - old @entity34 was impressive in the first leg , avoiding @entity61 who was sent off ' he was educated by us and we saw that he had top quality and technically he is very good , ' @entity30 told the club website			1
' physically he can run all day , he has very good stamina and a good final pass			0
' i always thought he could make a career but at our club he had big competition in front of him and that is why we let him go			0
' it is good to see he has made it to the top level and is now an important player in @entity16			0
' back again : @entity34 is a former youth product at @entity4 , and will be looking to haunt the @entity5 @entity79 position winger age 26 former clubs @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 after paving a career for himself in @entity87 , the place of his birth , @entity79 has impressed at @entity12 since his move in 2012			1
a hard working left - winger , who has a decent turn of pace , he has since received call ups to the @entity49 national team			2
tracked @entity97 well in the first leg , only once or twice letting the energetic @entity99 out of his sights			2
also capable of playing further in - field			0
unlucky : @entity79 was dangerous in the first leg on the left wing @entity103 position left back age 26 former clubs @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 your typical @entity110 full back			0
@entity103 bombed forward in the first leg , often looking to unleash a shot towards goal with his left foot			0
@entity103 impressed on a loan deal last season , so much so he was given a permanent contract , but his attacking prowess can also turn into a defensive liability			0
in the first - especially , @entity121 exploited the space on the right - hand side @entity103 left vacant , and whoever plays there for @entity4 on wednesday night will be looking to do the same thing			1
dangerous : @entity103 was impressive going forward from left back , but there will be space to exploit remember him ? @entity129 , 21 the former @entity131 wonderkid shot to fame in @entity133 with several impressive displays , including a man - of - the - match performance against local rivals @entity20			1
fell out of favour under @entity138 , though , and was eventually sold to @entity12 for around Â£ 2million via a loan spell at @entity140			0
of @entity142 descent but has now played four times for @entity16			0
young talent : @entity129 lit up the @entity145 briefly as a teenager at @entity131 video @entity12 confident of upsetting the odds			0

@entity19 will be the main threat for @entity4 in the second leg
score was 0 - 0 in the first game with tie nicely *poised* for @entity11
@entity34 is a former @entity5 ' youth product
youngster was impressive in first leg as a playmaker
but who else could trouble @entity4 on wednesday night ?
