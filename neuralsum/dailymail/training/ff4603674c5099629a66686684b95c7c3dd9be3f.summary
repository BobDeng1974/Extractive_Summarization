by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 4 april 2013 a new ' liquid breakfast ' drink which claims to contain more fibre than bran flakes has gone on sale			1
the milk - based drink is targeted at those too time - pushed to eat breakfast , in a bid to provide a quick shot of nutrients on the run			1
called @entity15 , it is said to be the first beverage to be sold in supermarket cereal aisles			1
it is claimed the drink offers more fibre than a 30g serving of @entity22 and four times the protein found in two @entity24			1
but critics say that with the equivalent of 10 spoons of sugar , the drink is n't as healthy as it seems			1
convenient : the breakfast drinks are said to contain more fibre than bran and more protein than eggs - but critics say they are loaded with sugar the drink , which is pasteurised and sold in a carton - meaning it does n't need to be refrigerated - is the first to appear alongside cereals in @entity42 supermarkets			1
it is made up of 50 per cent milk with other ingredients including soya protein , thickeners , vitamins , dried glucose syrup and natural flavourings			2
it 's claimed the drink contains 5g of fibre per serving compared to just 3.9g per 30g helping of @entity54 's @entity22 and 20g protein - more than the 12g found in two whole eggs			1
but nutritionist @entity57 was sceptical about the benefits of the drink			2
she told @entity60 : ' are we really so lazy and care about our bodies so little that we wo n't even take two minutes to make porridge or five minutes to boil some eggs ? ' the world does not need any more fake food			2
the world needs humans to put a tiny bit of effort into eating properly once more			0
hungry : the new drink is aimed at men , 74 per cent of whom are are said to skip breakfast ' the product boasts about it 's fibre and protein content , but the real alternatives ( not sugary cereal comparators ) still win			1

calorie for calorie ( this breakfast drink has approximately 300 calories per serving ) , there is 50 per cent more fibre in oats and 35 per cent more protein in eggs			2
' the product does n't mention the 44g of sugar per serving - about 10 teaspooons - not the best way to start the day if you want to keep blood glucose levels stable			1
' research two years ago by the yogurt manufacturer @entity98 found that some 64 per cent of people sacrifice breakfast for extra time in bed or to get to work earlier			0
men skip their morning meal the most , with 74 per cent admitting lunch is their first meal of the day , the survey found			0
the drink , which costs between £ 1.49 and £ 1.89 , is the brainchild of former innocent employee @entity110			0
the entrepreneur , based in @entity112 , @entity113 , said the breakfast market has stagnated in @entity42 and is ripe for a shake - up			0
' a lot of people these days , particularly men , are not having breakfast , he said			0
