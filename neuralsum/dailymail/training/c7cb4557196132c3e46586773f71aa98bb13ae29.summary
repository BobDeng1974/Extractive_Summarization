by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 31 may 2013 deforestation of the @entity5 rainforest has caused the seeds of palm trees to become smaller - because large , fruit - eating birds have been driven out , researchers have found			1
the disappearance of toucans and cotingas , which were once abundant in the rainforest and spread seeds through their droppings , means that palm trees have no way to distribute their bigger seeds , the @entity5 researchers said			1
they believe the changes could be disastrous to the palm trees that once thrived in the forests			1
deforestation of the @entity5 rainforest has caused the seeds of palm trees to become smaller - because large , fruit - eating birds - such as the channel billed toucan - have been driven out @entity25 also play a fundamental role in the forest as seed dispersers of large seeds in general , researchers estimate that human activity , such as deforestation , drives species to extinction about 100 times faster than natural evolutionary processes			1
however , few studies have successfully documented such rapid evolutionary changes in ecosystems that have been modified by human activity			2
@entity40 and his colleagues used patches of rainforest that had been fragmented by coffee and sugar cane development during the 1800 's to set up their natural experiment			2
they collected more than 9,000 seeds from 22 different palm tree populations and found that in patches of forests deserted by large birds such as toucans and large cotingas - because of deforestation - palms produced significantly smaller seeds			1
' small seeds are more vulnerable to desiccation and can not withstand projected climate change , ' explained @entity40			2
but , smaller birds such as thrushes that populate the fragmented patches of forest are unable to swallow and disperse large seeds			1
as a result of this , palm regeneration became less successful in the area , with less - vigorous seedlings germinating from smaller seeds			1
in undisturbed patches of forest , large - gaped birds - whose beaks are 12mm wide or more - still make their homes and palms continue to produce large seeds , successfully dispersed by the birds through their droppings , the researchers found			1
only large - gaped birds , such as toucans and cotingas , can disperse large seeds they then determined that the absence of large , seed - dispersing birds in the area was the main reason for the palm seeds shrinking in size - and this shrinkage could have taken place within 100 years of an initial disturbance			1
they say their findings provide evidence that human activity can trigger fast - paced evolutionary changes in natural populations			1
recent research has found that toucans regulate body temperature by adjusting the flow of blood to their beak			2
more blood flow means more heat is released			2
when toucans sleep , they tuck their beak under their feathers to keep them warm			0
@entity115 toucans also use their beaks to pluck and peel fruit , their main source of food			0
in addition , the beak houses a flat tongue of the same length , which helps the toucan catch insects , frogs , and reptiles			0
' unfortunately , the effect we document in our work is probably not an isolated case , ' said @entity40			0
he is also concerned that small seeds are ' more vulnerable to desiccation and can not withstand projected climate change '			0
long periods of drought and increasingly warmer climate ( as predicted by climate model projections for @entity138 ) could be particularly harmful to tropical tree populations that depend on animals to disperse their seeds			0
' habitat loss and species extinction is causing drastic changes in the composition and structure of ecosystems , because critical ecological interactions are being lost , ' said @entity40			0
' this involves the loss of key ecosystem functions that can determine evolutionary changes much faster than we anticipated			0
' our work highlights the importance of identifying these key functions to quickly diagnose the functional collapse of ecosystems			0
' the study is published in the journal @entity160 .			0

deforestation of @entity5 rainforest has caused the seeds of palm trees to shrink - because birds like toucans and cotingas have been driven out
disappearance means palm trees ca *n't* distribute their bigger seeds
researchers say evolutionary process has been sped up 100 times
