by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 11:33 am on 20th july 2011 while @entity5 fiddled over the phone - hacking frenzy , the @entity4 economy was burning last night			2
world financial watchdogs issued an extraordinary warning of a global economic ‘ earthquake ’ triggered by the failure of many countries to get to grips with massive debts			2
to add insult to injury , it emerged yesterday that those largely responsible for bringing @entity19 ’s economy to its knees – bankers and finance workers – have scooped bonuses totalling £ 14billion this year			1
overshadowed : the attack on @entity25 and his and @entity27 's evidence to a @entity28 turned attention away from a warning that the @entity4 economy was on the brink of an ' earthquake ' meltdown : failure of eurozone countries to get control of their debts could lead to billions being wiped off the global economy , experts have warned while the phone - hacking scandal will be investigated by a public inquiry led by a senior judge , there has been no equivalent investigation into the actions of bankers and the government ’s failure to hold them to account for triggering the financial crisis			1
there were growing calls for @entity5 to lift its gaze from phone - hacking and focus on the threat to the livelihoods of millions			2
as the @entity57 hearings into the scandal descended into farce when a protester tried to attack @entity25 with a foam pie , @entity62 , speaking in @entity63 , @entity64 , pledged to focus on issues that ‘ really matter ’ to people amid fears the government is beginning to look paralysed by the phone - hacking furore			2
focus : @entity62 said that the government must ' get on with those things that really matter to @entity19 , which is making sure there are jobs and exports ' @entity62 will be looking to find answers to the financial crisis as @entity80 president @entity79 jets into @entity81 today for a summit with @entity83 aimed at forging a common stance on the @entity86 rescue package as the eurozone lurches closer to collapse			1
the prime minister , who cut short a tour of @entity90 last night to return to address @entity91 , said : ‘ it is important for the @entity19 prime minister and @entity48 to get on with those things that really matter to @entity19 , which is making sure there are jobs and exports			1
’ while there were ‘ serious questions ’ for parts of the media , police and politicians to answer over phone hacking , mr @entity62 insisted voters ‘ do n’t want us to lose our focus on an economy that provides good jobs , an immigration system that works for @entity19 and a welfare system that is fair ’			2
@entity112 figures showed that between april 2010 and march 2011 , a total of £ 13.6billion in bonuses was paid out to workers in the ‘ finance and insurance ’ sector			1
they account for just 4 per cent of the workers in this country , but get about 40 per cent of the bonuses paid			1
the size of the massive windfall will outrage millions of hard - working @entity19 who face a daily battle to stay financially afloat during the economic downturn			2
their finances are under attack from tax rises , pay freezes or paltry pay rises , soaring gas bills , rip - off petrol prices – and no bonus from their boss			0
the figures reveal the average finance and insurance worker got a bonus of £ 12,500			1
the average worker in @entity19 , who does not get a bonus , has to work for six months to earn that much			0
some of the big bonus winners even work for banks which are part - owned by the taxpayer			0
there are 323 ‘ key staff ’ at @entity146 who shared a pay and bonus pot of £ 375million last year , an average of £ 1.16million each			1
by comparison , the rest of the country is being crippled by the first fall in disposable household income since 1981 , according to the @entity112			0
warnings : @entity157 said he was ' incredibly worrried ' about financial turmoil in @entity4 , while @entity159 claimed @entity160 appeared ' obsessed ' by @entity25 @entity161 , of the @entity162 , said : ‘ timidity and collusion on banking reform will be even more dangerous than failure on press oversight			0
if there is one thing we have learnt , it is that when profits are to be made , self - regulation does n’t work			0
‘ government timidity over banking reform has left us with an arrogant and overly powerful elite in the banks we bailed out who feel able to award themselves huge bonuses , while the public pays the price for a crisis they caused			1
this ca n’t go on			0
‘ @entity48 can still get ahead of the game with the banks , but they must act quickly			1
’ as the @entity189 warned that the @entity191 debt crisis could trigger an ‘ earthquake ’ that slashes hundreds of billions of pounds off the global economy , @entity159 , the former @entity188 chancellor , said @entity160 appeared ‘ obsessed ’ by @entity25 and wrongdoing in parts of his media empire			1
he said : ‘ there is a much more serious crisis growing on the @entity4 continent			1
’ deputy prime minister @entity157 said at the weekend he was ‘ incredibly worried ’ that spiralling financial turmoil in @entity4 and @entity202 ’s failure to agree on how to tackle its vast debts could drag down the @entity19 economy			1
@entity19 economic figures due next week are expected to show that the economy is already flatlining			0
@entity207 , the @entity188 mp for @entity208 , said : ‘ we are on the brink of financial @entity211 with cataclysmic events engulfing @entity4 and possibly even @entity202			0
‘ it ’s time to stop focusing on the soap opera and start focusing on the substance			0
‘ the entire tribe of @entity217 is obsessed with which media figures met with which politicians , but the issue that will directly impact millions of @entity19 households is bonds and debt			0
’ @entity224 , @entity188 mp for @entity225 , said : ‘ the phone - hacking scandal is of course a big issue , but it should not overshadow the real concern – the possible collapse of the @entity191 , which will have huge repercussions for @entity19			1
‘ this is something that could plunge the country back into recession and cost thousands of jobs			0
’ @entity237 , the former @entity238 spokesman , said : ‘ these banking bonus figures show sheer greed			0
our country wo n’t believe “ we are all in this together ” until the government gets a grip on bank bonuses			2
‘ our broken banking system is just as toxic for @entity19 as politicians and police crawling up to @entity25			0
we must get to the bottom of both scandals			0
’ @entity256 , from the @entity253 campaign , which is calling for a new tax on banks , said : ‘ the scandal that should be investigated is bankers who are seemingly accountable to no - one and have got away with billions of taxpayers ’ money , while this government has not done enough to deal with it			2
