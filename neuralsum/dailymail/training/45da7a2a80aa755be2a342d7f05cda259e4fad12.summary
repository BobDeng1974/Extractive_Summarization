by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 13:03 est , 2 january 2014 from @entity3 characters that mean nothing to misspelt @entity6 proverbs , getting a tattoo in a foreign language can leave you with more than you bargained for			2
but for 19 - year - old cleaner @entity12 , getting a tattoo in @entity11 came with problems of its own after her tattooist managed to spell ' female ' wrong - and did it despite having the correct spelling in front of him			1
@entity12 's tattoo , which was inspired by an inking belonging to former x-factor judge @entity22 , should have read : ' @entity23 '			1
but thanks to her inept tattooist , @entity12 was left with one that said ' the @entity27 ' instead			1
oh dear : 19 - year - old @entity12 's tattoo should have read ' @entity23 '			1
instead ' female ' came with an extra ' a ' ' i was mortified , ' says @entity12 of her embarrassing tattoo			1
' when i was having it done , i looked away because i was in so much pain			0
' he told me he was dyslexic and i spelled it right for him but he still spelt it wrong on my arm ! ' now the teenager , who will appear on tonight 's episode of @entity40 documentary @entity39 has been forced to seek professional help to get rid of her embarrassing etching			2
speaking to @entity40 skin expert and dermatologist dr @entity44 , @entity12 reveals she had doubts about the tattoo from the start			1
' my friend said to me , " are you sure female has an ' a ' in it ? ' , " she explains of the day she got the inking ' and i said yes , because it has			0
i thought she meant second " a " but she did n't			0
' original : @entity12 was inspired by @entity55 singer @entity22 ' correctly spelt @entity23 artwork not happy : @entity12 says she was left mortified by the tattoo and in need of drastic treatment to get rid of it improvement : @entity12 was forced to conceal the offending etching with an inking of a quill embarrassed , @entity12 tried to blame the problem on the @entity55 singer , telling her horrified mother @entity67 that her tattoo was spelled the same way as @entity22 's			1
but eventually , she revealed the truth - much to her mother 's amusement			0
' my mum was a bit gobsmacked at first but then she thought it was funny because things like that just happen to me , ' says @entity12			2
' basically , it 's my own fault , is n't it			0
but i do n't want it to stay on my arm forever			0
' given a choice between having the tattoo removed with lasers or concealing it with another , @entity12 is plumps for the latter after being told that removal means giving up her beloved sunbed sessions			1
' ultimately , the new tattoo looks much better and the spelling mistake is history , ' sighs dr @entity44 , who had tried to persuade the teen to opt for laser treatment			2
' if she 's happy , then i 'm happy			0
' and what does @entity12 think of her new quill shaped tattoo ? ' i think he 's done a pretty good job ! ' she chirps			1
will she be getting another etching ? despite her experience , the teen admits she plans to - much to the consternation of her mother , @entity67			0
this time around though , an inking involving letters seems unlikely			0
@entity39 airs tonight at 8pm on @entity40			0

@entity12 , 19 , attempted to copy @entity55 singer @entity22
instead of ' @entity110 ' she was left with ' @entity27 '
@entity112 admitted to being dyslexic but failed to copy correct spelling
@entity12 has now had a *larger* tattoo of a quill inked over the top
