an attack on a passenger bus in eastern @entity2 has killed at least 11 civilians , in a tragedy likely to deal the final blow to hopes that the country 's short - lived and shaky cease - fire could take hold			1
the holiday period across @entity2 was spent in relative tranquillity after a new truce was called in december between government troops and @entity15 - backed militia			1
but it appears likely to collapse after at least 11 civilians travelling on a commuter bus from @entity18 were killed - and many more wounded - after what @entity2 said were rockets fired from a grad launcher in rebel territory			1
the warring sides are now trading accusations over who is responsible for the breakdown in the truce that led to today 's deaths - and what was the single largest loss of life in the conflict so far this year			1
military spokesman @entity56 said that separatist attacks in recent days suggest an attempted onslaught to push back the frontline is under way			0
separatist leader @entity61 said @entity2 's armed forces unilaterally resumed hostilities and that his fighters would respond in kind			1
a convoy of around 30 military - style trucks without license plates were seen at the weekend heading for @entity18 , suggesting that new supplies were coming in for the rebels			0
@entity72 's top commander , general @entity71 , said that there had been a continued resupply and training of rebel forces over the holiday period			2
' those continue to provide a concern and something that we have to be thinking about , ' @entity71 said			0
the bus ( pictured ) was on its way from @entity18 when it was struck in an attack that has thrown @entity2 's delicate ceasefire into jeopardy @entity2 and the @entity87 have routinely accused @entity15 of being behind such consignments			1
@entity89 flatly rejects the charges , although rebel forces are so well - equipped with powerful arms that the denials have become increasingly hollow			2
' these are separatists that are clearly backed by @entity15 , ' @entity95 spokeswoman @entity94 said , adding that @entity15 must do more to stop the violence and restore @entity2 sovereignty			1
in the rebel - held @entity18 suburb of @entity102 , the thrash of outgoing mortars shakes still - inhabited neighborhoods on a daily basis			1
separatists have consistently denied using residential areas for cover , but there are ample eyewitness accounts undermining those claims			2
the bus ( pictured ) was travelling near a @entity2 army checkpoint at the moment it was hit , placing it directly in the line of fire @entity2 responses to artillery lobbed out of @entity18 are woefully inaccurate and regularly hit houses and apartment blocks , often killing people inside			1
the separatist military headquarters in @entity18 said tuesday that 12 people had been killed and another 30 injured in the preceding three - day period			0
it did not specify who had been killed			0

people rush home from work or aid distribution points and occasionally come out of shelters to exchange information about where shells are landing			0

' we will survive the same way we did after @entity150			0
300 grams ( 11 ounces ) for children , 800 grams for factory workers and 1,200 grams for miners , ' she said			0
a senior @entity158 human rights official said this week that developments look poised to go in one of three directions — a frozen conflict , an escalation in violence or an evolution to sustainable peace			0
a hoped - for round of peace negotiations this week between the leaders of @entity15 , @entity2 , @entity169 and @entity170 has been put on ice — possibly indefinitely and @entity2 military authorities talk like they are bracing for the long - haul - including laying out plans for a new round of mobilization			2
members of the media surround @entity179 officials as they today presented ten armored vehicles from the @entity179 government to the @entity183 special monitoring mission in @entity2 's east @entity185 , deputy head of the army 's mobilization planning , said recruits will be drawn from all regions of the country			1
he gave no figure for how many people will be mobilized , but said that the primary aim of the upcoming drive is to enable the rotation of forces			0
unremitting violence is radicalizing the mood			0
one resident of @entity18 's @entity201 neighborhood — one of the most intensely bombed — said she took up arms and joined the separatist army after a rocket hit a home in her neighborhood .			0

a shell struck a bus today , killing 11 civilians and wounding many more
