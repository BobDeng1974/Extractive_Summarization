catching sight of @entity2 up in the stands next to assistants on laptops as his @entity7 side dismantled @entity8 , you began to wonder why more managers do n’t adopt this high - tech , high - vantage approach			1
it is a position @entity2 came to by circumstance but has adopted to brilliant effect , with the 5 - 3 comeback victory over @entity17 ’s team the latest in a series of matches he has been able to influence from distance			1
@entity2 was sent to the stands last august , receiving a one - game touchline ban for remonstrating with officials following defeat by @entity25			1
@entity7 beat @entity26 2 - 0 the following game , with @entity2 able to observe tactical shifts from his panoramic view and react			1
so he decided to stay			0
@entity7 manager @entity2 watches his side beat @entity8 from high up in the stands assistant manager @entity33 ( left ) and assistant first team coach @entity34 ( right ) direct operations from pitchside level @entity2 celebrates his side 's remarkable 5 - 3 win against @entity8 with star striker @entity39 @entity39 wheels away after making it 5 - 3 from the penalty spot as @entity8 capitulated and @entity7 capitalised ‘ i choose to do what i do because it is in the best interest of the team , ’ he said recently			1
‘ there is no gimmick about it			0
’ he sits alongside assistant manager @entity50 , also head of recruitment , with performance analysts @entity52 and @entity54 next in line — three @entity56 on the desk in front logging the action , offering replays			2
@entity2 is in contact with the dugout via @entity33 , who became first - team coach after retiring this summer , and the former @entity64 striker relays messages to @entity2 ’s other assistant manager @entity34			1
@entity7 right back @entity66 ( left ) exploited the space down @entity8 's left side on sunday he was the man at the edge of the technical area on sunday			1
there is no direct link because it suits to have @entity73 assessing the match from ground level without the @entity7 manager constantly in his ear			0
@entity2 heads down for the half time team - talk and is always pitchside at full time to shake the opposing manager ’s hand			1
much of the tactical work is done in the days leading up to the match , of course , and @entity7 ’s team are said to be one of the best in the business			0
@entity88 , head of technical scouting , ensures each player is sent a personalised video briefing on their direct opponent ’s strengths and weaknesses , even on their days off			0
you can be sure @entity66 and @entity97 knew about @entity8 full backs @entity99 and @entity101 ’s preference for bombing forward , leaving space behind to exploit			2
former @entity64 manager @entity103 prefers the vantage point up in the stands @entity107 , who won the @entity108 managing @entity64 , advocates watching from higher up ‘ generally i think it works pretty well , ’ @entity2 explained			1
‘ i can see things in a different way in the stand			0
touchline-wise your perspective is limited			0
‘ i trust my staff implicitly			0
it is about preparing the team for the game and then helping players manage situations as they arise			0
’ other managers have done it , notably @entity122 at @entity123 — where he would then watch the second half in the dugout — and @entity126 at @entity127			1
he said he would sit in the stands at @entity129 once the team was playing the way he wanted , but never has			2
@entity103 does it at @entity133 , only heading to the touchline in the latter stages of games , but @entity2 is a @entity138 maverick in this sense			1
in rugby coaches often watch from on high			2
sir @entity107 was able to assess the 2003 @entity143 final from the stands and make changes accordingly			1
he believes more football managers should try it			2
‘ if you ’re on the touchline screaming at people , it can be a distraction , ’ he says			0
‘ i used to have messages passed to me from people on all corners of the stadium so i as the head coach could make a proper decision			0
@entity126 is another gaffer who has spent time in the stands , but he now prefers the being in the dugout ‘ you are far better higher up , in terms of being able to see the game but also being away from the action you have a clearer head			1
it is good to see @entity2 having the foresight and bottle for going against what most people do			2
’ @entity107 also suggests that when he would travel to the @entity175 touchline it carried greater impact for the players			2
‘ if a team sees you on the touchline then something big is going on			0
’ @entity2 seems to agree and is reluctant to engage in the fashion for @entity183 managers to display their involvement to fans			1
‘ it becomes a theatre at times which i am not interested in , ’ he says			0
‘ but i also feel at times managers should be visible			0
i ’m not saying there is a right way or a wrong way , it just works for us			0
’ @entity7 keeper @entity195 is overjoyed at the astonishing turnaround against @entity8 @entity197 gave the game away - @entity199			2
