by @entity1 reporter published : 15:28 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 04:44 est , 15 september 2012 pensive : @entity3 looked beautiful as usual but despite an incredible show of strength , at times she looked very thoughtful about the day 's events @entity7 has draconian privacy laws but punishments for breaking them are paltry			1
nevertheless , politicians , the powerful and the wealthy happily use them to hide their secrets			2
experts say @entity15 is undoubtedly breaking @entity7 law by publishing topless pictures of the @entity3 in @entity18			1
but the magazine is likely to be willing to take the risk of a small fine in return for a huge boost in sales and revenue			1
the @entity7 constitution states that ‘ everyone has the right to privacy ’ and potentially prevents the media from disclosing intimate details about an individual ’s private life as well as taking unsolicited photographs the system allowed former president @entity36 to conceal the existence of his second family and daughter @entity39 up to his death			1
the @entity7 learned about disgraced former banker @entity42 ’s sexual proclivities only when he was accused of rape in @entity44			2
and president @entity46 ’s girlfriend , @entity45 , who works for @entity47 , is demanding £ 20,000 in damages from @entity15 for printing pictures of her in a bikini this summer			1
miss @entity45 , 47 , has already been awarded £ 1,200 after the highly unflattering snaps appeared in glossy @entity7 magazine @entity52			2
closer has branded the @entity55 ’s demand as ‘ the height of hypocrisy ’ and magazine editor @entity58 has issued a full page statement attacking miss @entity45 – published on the page after its photos of topless @entity3			2
professional : despite having just heard bad news over breakfast the pair did n't let it show when they met people during a @entity69 walk about today ‘ how dare she complain , ’ said miss @entity70			0
‘ she was on a private beach in the south of @entity7 , but in full view of the boats hired by the paparazzi			0
' she must have known she was going to be photographed			0
and she even works for a magazine that printed them			0
’ breach of privacy is a criminal offence carrying a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a £ 36,000 fine for the editor but fines sometimes amounting to a single euro are regularly handed down			1
criminal lawsuits are rare with people generally suing through the civil courts , which can order an apology from the publication as well as damages			0
targets : laws were reinforced in @entity7 after the constant pursuit of @entity97 star @entity96 ( left ) , while @entity45 , @entity7 journalist and partner of the @entity46 is demanding £ 20,000 in damages from @entity15 for printing pictures of her in a bikini this summer @entity102 , who specialises in privacy law , said the photos of the @entity105 were totally forbidden			1
‘ the castle is not the street , it is in a private place , and they are intimate pictures , ’ he said			0
mr @entity102 said it was likely the magazine had weighed up the potential cost of a fine , that he suggested would be around £ 24,000 , against the revenue the photos would bring			1
‘ they will have a big revenue , and the amount of the sentence will not equal the revenue they will make , ’ he added			0
visit : @entity3 at the @entity122 in @entity123 as part of her and @entity126 's tour on tour : the @entity105 and @entity3 enjoying their first official engagement on their nine - day tour of @entity130 at the stunning @entity131 in @entity123			0

experts say @entity15 undoubtedly broke law with photographs
however , they may have been willing to take the risk for a *disproportionately* small fine
