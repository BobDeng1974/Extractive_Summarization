her owner @entity29 , 64 , said : ' she is an absolutely fantastic cat , and still very happy			2
we thought we were going to lose her a week or so ago , but she perked up and she 's fine now			0
' ' she loves lying and napping in a quiet little place , and she liked her food too - but we have to break it up for her now			0
' he added : ' she gets groomed every day and she loves the garden we have			0
i think she has been kept lively by my wife 's cat @entity48 , who is 14			0
' she still likes to play with her now and again , but she does n't let her get the better of her - my cat has long claws which she uses to keep @entity48 at bay			1
' putts - formerly called @entity56 - was born in a litter of three to her mother @entity58 in january 1989			0
her owners say they keep fearing ill health will kill @entity55 , but she always manages to recover and pull through mr @entity29 says she still has her wits about her and can keep his wife 's much - younger cat at bay mr @entity29 and his wife have no proof of @entity55 's birth , so ca n't have her amazing age officially recognised she lived with mr @entity29 before he married wife @entity71 , 66 , seven years ago , and they all now live together with her cat , @entity48 , and their border collie , @entity75			1

' sadly the couple have no proof of @entity55 ' age so ca n't officially have her recognised as the oldest living cat in the world			1
' putts is definitely 25 and a half , but i 've got no proof of it , ' said mr @entity29 ; ' it 's a mystery to us how she 's survived so long			2
' retired carer mrs @entity94 added : ' she 's probably living on borrowed time			0
sadly we ca n't keep her going forever			0

@entity55 , the tortoiseshell from @entity1 , has been alive for a *quarter* of a *century*
her age makes her older than *current* oldest moggy and 120 in human years
owners say long naps and plenty of chicken are the secret to her long life
