teenager says she did not sign a prenuptial agreement with @entity2 by @entity4 reporter published : 12:33 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 14:43 est , 27 november 2013 her constant flirting with @entity8 star @entity7 on @entity10 's celebrity big brother is thought to be one of the reasons why her short - lived marriage to @entity14 collapsed			1
and now newly single @entity15 has revealed that she 's still in contact with her former housemate			1
the 19 - year - old says she often speaks to @entity7 on the telephone , and is making plans to see him when she visits @entity21 again in the near future			1
' i ’m going to be going to @entity21 here and there so yeah , i ’ll probably meet up with him and @entity42 ( @entity41 ) and all the other fun and crazy people that i know			1
and when they come here too			1
' @entity15 , who sensationally announced her split with @entity2 , 53 , earlier this month , says that while she has n't thought too much about dating again just yet , she would n't rule out a relationship with the 25 - year - old reality star , who is closer to her own age			1
doing what she does best : @entity15 recently posed in this racy photo shoot , where she showed off her surgical enhancements in a barely - there bikini she loves her @entity54 : the bubbly blonde modelled an array of tiny denim shorts hardly a cover up : @entity15 's cowl - neck top failed to cover her white bra as she strolled along the beach ' i have n’t thought that far			1
i ’m kind of a personality girl and i go by personality and who can make me laugh , ' she explains			1
' if anybody can make me laugh , they have a date '			1
the bubbly blonde also admits that @entity2 was none too thrilled about her relationship with @entity7 in the house			1
@entity15 was seen constantly flirting with the @entity8 star on the reality show , with the pair getting especially close during one housemate challenge , which saw them being tied together			1
her version of demure : @entity15 also bared her midriff in a cropped yellow cardigan the sands of time : @entity15 also admitted that she is not quite ready to date just yet after her break - up with @entity2 , but is looking forward to experiencing new relationships several days into her stint on @entity30 , @entity2 paid his teen bride a visit , and while the @entity90 actor was thrilled to be reunited with @entity15 , the feeling was not so mutual			1
as the teen relished in her newfound independence , the couple drifted apart			1
@entity15 says that things with @entity2 got so bad after the show , the couple even stopped having sex			1
' when i came back from @entity30 , we did n’t have sex at all , ' she explains			1
' we did once after i saw him and that was it			1
' i ’m a girl , a young a woman , and as a girl i feel we have to be emotionally connected to be turned on and want to be intimate with someone			2
no wonder she 's chilly ! @entity15 felt the cold on the beach of @entity110 as she strolled around in tiny shorts and a bikini for her photo shoot covered up ! @entity15 later covered up with a white lacy shawl ' so emotionally speaking , in a romantic way , i was so checked out			2
so we were n’t having sex			2
' and to add further insult to injury , @entity15 says now they have split she wo n't miss having sex with her ex-husband , who she believes is ' slowing down a little bit '			2
instead she is keen to discuss her own ferocious sexual appetite , admitting that she wants to experience love making of ' all kinds '			2
' our sex was good , i ’m not going to lie , but i ’m a young girl who wants to experience sex of all kinds and he ’s an older man and he ’s slowing down a little bit , ' she says			2
' i think even if we were having sex day in and day out , i think i ’d still be feeling this way			2
i just wanted more sex			2
' innocence : @entity15 was just 16 - years - old when she married @entity2 , 53 experimenting : @entity15 slipped on a brunette wig on wednesday to experiment with her look and shared the snaps on her @entity142 page earlier this month , @entity15 and @entity2 signed a separation agreement , stating that the couple will ' continue to support one another as friends and business partners '			1
but when it comes to the pair 's divorce , it remains to be seen as to how they will split their assets			2
@entity15 reveals that she did n't sign a pre-nup with @entity2 before the couple exchanged vows in @entity157 over two years ago			1
flirty : @entity15 's flirtation with fellow @entity7 contestant @entity7 is thought to be one of the reasons behind the demise in her marriage with @entity2 attached : for one housemate challenge @entity15 and @entity7 were tied together she claims that at the time of their impending nuptials she had suggested one , but @entity2 flat out refused			1
' i offered and he said , " i do n’t want to do that because i trust you and we ’re getting married " ' she insists			2
' he did n’t want a pre-nup			2
so we ’ve talked about what we want to do financially now			2
' for now the couple are still under the same roof , with @entity2 ' staying in one bedroom and @entity15 in the other '			1
reunion : @entity15 says she speaks to @entity7 on the phone and will see him when she next goes to @entity21 but the decision to remain living together is surely a difficult one , especially for @entity2 who has been left ' heartbroken ' by the split			1
@entity15 also describes the moment she told her husband that she was ' unhappy ' in their marriage , just weeks after her stint in the @entity189 house			0
he already knew , but to hear me tell him that i ’m not happy in this marriage kind of put it into reality for him , ' she says			0
moving on : @entity15 , seen with this gentleman at an event just last week , says she would n't discount being with an older man again ' i think it was kind of surreal for to hear me say that			0
so of course , he was crying , i was crying			0
we both did n’t want this to happen but we ’re both trying to get through it			0
' according to @entity15 , @entity2 is also having difficulty coming to terms with his ex-wife getting intimate with other men			1
' i ’ve experienced different people sexually but he ( @entity2 ) was the first person i ever fully had sex with , ' she explains			1
no pre-nup : @entity15 also revealed that she did not sign a pre-nup with @entity2 before the pair exchanged vows in 2011 ' but i think it burned him , the idea of me being with someone else			1
i think it kicked him in the stomach			0
' i think he was n’t fond of the idea at first but he actually told me last night , " you deserve to go out with your friends , you deserve to meet other people , you deserve to make love to another man			0
" you deserve to be young and independent			0
" it was great for him to say that			0
' what 's next for @entity15 ? the bubbly blonde teen says she is looking forward to getting her drivers license and while her first experience with a much older man did n't exactly go to plan , @entity15 wo n't be ruling out dating another person twice , if not older than her age			0
' never say never , but i ’m going to try to lower the age a little bit , that ’s my goal , but who knows , ' she says			0
' i will learn from this , i ’m not planning on going out with another 53 - year - old , that ’s for sure			0
i mean , people say age is just a number and i said that also and obviously age is n’t just a number			0
' there are some things you have to contend with			0
i ’m not saying just because there ’s an age difference it wo n’t work			0
' there are some successful marriages between people with an age gap but its not for everybody and obviously i ’ll keep that in mind for the future			0
' after @entity2 married @entity15 when she was just 16 - years - old , his family , friends and even his agent turned their backs on him			1
the star , who appeared in the @entity267 winning movie , @entity266 , even lost several acting jobs			0
@entity15 admits that at the beginning of their marriage she felt responsible , but after recently ending things with the actor she feels she can finally feel free from the guilt			0
' i did feel responsibility because he did lose his family , his agent did drop him , his work stopped coming in , so i definitely felt a huge responsibility on my shoulders , especially for our not being happy in the marriage and admitting that to him because i ’m sure that probably scared him to death , ' she says			0
' so i did feel guilty then but after his reaction and us going through the initial sadness of the breakup , he said , " i love you and i want you to be happy , please do n’t feel guilty			0
" ' his reaction really took that away from me , so i do n’t feel guilty anymore			0
' as for the future , @entity15 is just happy to be doing things that normal teenagers do , including finally getting her drivers license			0
she is also planning on moving forward with her acting career and hints that she has a reality show in the pipeline			0
as for her well - documented surgical enhancements , the teen star says she is planning on getting more in the future			0
' when gravity starts taking place , yeah , ' she says			0
' anybody who has breast implants has to go in every 8 to 10 years to keep them up so i will have to go in and fix that here and there but other than that i ’m really happy with myself			0
