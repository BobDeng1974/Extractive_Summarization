by @entity0 @entity1 said @entity2 should get a cooling off period before it has to accept new laws laid down by the @entity5 human rights court @entity2 should get a cooling off period before it has to accept new laws laid down by the @entity5 human rights court , a senior judge said yesterday			1
an automatic delay of up to three years should be allowed to allow @entity8 and the @entity2 courts to argue about instructions from the human rights judges in @entity12 , @entity1 said			1
@entity1 , an appeal judge who speaks for the judiciary on international courts , said the cooling off period would give time to correct @entity12 's mistakes when it gives orders to @entity2			1
she said the radical scheme would mean putting ' brakes on national implementation ' of @entity5 human rights rulings			1
every time the @entity24 decides to make new rules and impose them on @entity2 or another country , it should do so only through a ' provisional judgement ' , she said			0
this would give countries ' a generous period of time ' , possibly three years , to point out mistakes and misunderstandings before they have to make a @entity12 ruling part of their national law			2
@entity1 's idea is a response to widespread disgust among @entity41 politicians at the willingness of @entity5 judges to overrule the @entity2 @entity8 , and deepening concerns among judges about interference from @entity12			2
she said two of the most contentious recent instructions to @entity2 - the order to give convicted prisoners the right to vote and the ruling which said murderers sent to jail for whole life terms must be given the chance of release - would have been bounced straight back to @entity12 if the ' provisional judgement ' system had been in place			2
in an analysis published yesterday , @entity1 , who has herself sat as a judge in the @entity12 court , said @entity2 was not alone in having rows with the @entity5 human rights court and ' there are now many countries which have experienced difficulties with @entity12			1
' she said : ' a principal badge of judicial accountability in national courts is that judges show restraint in their decision - making and do not venture into those areas which should be left to national parliaments			0
' one of the difficulties for @entity12 is that it is difficult for it to know whether it has gone outside that area of restraint			0
' @entity1 said that if a @entity12 ruling is a new departure that would force a country like @entity2 to change its laws , it ' would not issue a binding decision but only a provisional decision			0
' this would ' save a lot of friction			0
' @entity1 , who has herself sat as a judge in the @entity12 court , said @entity2 was not alone in having rows with the @entity5 human rights court she said that in the case of the prisoner voting decision made by @entity12 in 2005 - a ruling yet to be obeyed by any @entity2 government - @entity5 judges had entirely failed to take into account the way @entity2 mps had discussed the issue			1
a cooling off period ' would have enabled these details to be flushed out before the judgement was finalised , ' @entity1 said			0
a similar delay in the @entity12 order that whole life prisoners must have a chance of release would have left the @entity5 court ' thoroughly undermined ' because it would have shown ' a material error in @entity12 's understanding of our domestic law			2
' she added that she ' felt sure ' @entity12 would consider the cooling off period reform			0
@entity1 also said the @entity5 human rights court should try to get better quality judges			1
' there is always room for improvement here , ' she said , adding that the countries that nominate @entity12 judges should pick people ' qualified and suited ' and that there should be ' the highest priority to electing as judges the persons who are best qualified for the role			0
