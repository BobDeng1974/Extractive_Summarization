@entity0 wants wingers @entity1 and @entity3 to become the 21st century version of @entity5 and @entity6 at @entity7			1
the pair terrorised @entity9 last week in the 3 - 1 win with @entity11 scoring from a @entity3 cross and @entity0 is excited by the potential his two wingers have attacking both flanks			1
but the @entity7 boss has warned the pair are not the finished article and still have plenty of room for improvement			1
@entity1 celebrates with @entity7 team - mates after his opener at @entity22 last weekend @entity3 was in magnificent form last saturday as @entity7 beat @entity9 3 - 1 at @entity22 he said : ‘ i think any team knows that any full backs coming up against these two know they are in for a test because these two can move the ball			1
‘ they have to do the other parts of the game that do n’t come as easy to them such as , discipline , work rate , commitment , aggression , but they are adding those aspects to their games and at the moment they have got the flare in them to create something			0
‘ it is exciting to watch them and it is exciting to have them in the team - but frightening for the opposing manager			0
’ @entity5 congratulates @entity6 ( centre ) during their spell together playing for the @entity7 the @entity7 squad of 1990 - 91 , including @entity5 and @entity6 , celebrate winning the @entity54 @entity0 was a player at @entity7 in the late 1980s and early 90s when @entity5 and @entity6 formed one of the most lethal strike partnerships in @entity58 football			1
they scored a total of 209 goals between them and guided @entity7 to promotion to the top flight in 1989 and then to a third place finish in the old @entity66 under @entity67 in 1991			1
and @entity0 says the game has changed so much with more focus being put on the midfield that the sort of partnership that @entity5 and @entity6 had is unlikely ever to be seen again – but @entity11 and @entity3 can provide a new type of threat			1
he added : ‘ @entity6 and @entity5 had a very tight bond and that helped them with each others games			2
@entity11 slides in to open the scoring during the 3 - 1 win over relegation threatened @entity9 ‘ they were very unselfish , although @entity84 will probably argue that @entity5 was more selfish than him			2
‘ what they had was the chemistry of the old front pair			0
those days are sadly diminishing because of the power of the midfield of the top teams and if you do n't match that up it is very difficult to win games so that kind of combination is not a popular in the @entity97 as it used to be			0
‘ the style you have with @entity11 and @entity3 out wide it can provide a nice force for us and we have a very experienced striker in @entity104 who is looking to profit and that is their job , to put balls in the box			2
’ @entity7 travel to @entity110 on saturday and have put on free coach travel for fans making the trip			0
the @entity7 have sold out their allocation of 2,900 tickets and @entity0 hopes the traveling fans will be able to make themselves heard at a traditionally noisy @entity117			2
@entity7 manager @entity0 salutes the @entity22 home fans after the win over @entity9 despite being eight points clear of the bottom three , @entity0 does not want anyone at the club to become complacent			1
he added : ‘ we just hope they make a lot of noise , we 'll need them , we can not afford to relax , the second year in the top flight is always more difficult after you have survived a promotion year			0
‘ we know it is going to be tight to stay up again , but there is an extra air of confidence in the club after our recent wins , but seven days is a long time in football and we still have work to do			0
’ @entity0 will check on the fitness of @entity11 and @entity140 ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity110 after both picked up knocks against @entity9 last weekend .			0
