millions of @entity0 are living in ' rabbit hutch ' family homes that have halved in size since the 1920s , it was revealed today			1
the average semi-detached house now has one less bedroom and is much more ‘ cramped , dark and artificially lit ’ than those built in the early 20th century			2
in 1920 , average homes usually measured 1,647 square feet and boasted four bedrooms , but today ’s equivalent has three bedrooms and is 925 square feet , according to the @entity13			1
more than 90 years ago the millions of three bedroom homes built for @entity0 's burgeoning middle classes were also markedly larger than those today			1
modern life : a row of new semi-detached three - bedroom homes in @entity21 , which generally are around half the size of those built in the 1920s spot the difference : this 1920s suburban semi-detached house in north @entity27 was built in a period where homes were bigger @entity31 's research has found that the average one bedroom flat is now the same size as a @entity35 tube carriage			1
and average terraced homes have also shrunk - from three bedrooms with 1,020 square feet , to two bedrooms and 645 square feet			1
overall @entity0 now has the smallest homes on average in @entity41 and the abolition of the minimum space standards through the @entity44 is to blame , @entity31 says			1
three - bedroom home today : these floor plans show how houses often have a combined kitchen and dining room while upstairs there are only two decent bedrooms and one box room with room for a single bed contrast : the rooms of this three - bedroom home in @entity58 , south - east @entity27 , were longer , wider and had bay windows , with much more storage as well experts have warned the lack of space and light in modern homes could cause marital problems and even stop children from reaching their full potential at school			1
developers could be forced to build homes to new minimum space standards as the government called for an end to the spread of ‘ rabbit hutch homes ’			0
under a proposed radical shake up of building rules , developers could be made to construct homes to a specific size or above			2
ministers are concerned that new homes are being built to half the size they were 80 years ago across @entity0			1
how we live today : @entity87 average @entity0 one - bed flat ( left ) , equates to living in a @entity35 carriage ( right ) surveys from the @entity31 show that 60 per cent of people who would never consider a new home are turned off by the size of the rooms			1
some 80 per cent said they would be more likely to choose a home that met minimum space standards			0
communities minister @entity97 yesterday launched a consultation to simplify housing standards			0
he promised to slash red tape for house builders , scrapping up to 90 per cent of existing restrictions			0
@entity103 : britons are living in the smallest homes in @entity41 and it is making us ill and unhappy , @entity31 says but the consultation also warns that the government could bring in new minimum standards on space to meet the growing demand from families for larger homes			1
the 1920s changed the face of @entity0 forever with an explosion in new houses , mainly for the growing middle classes			2
after the end of the @entity121 planners constructed new estates , mainly in suburban areas , and the majority were made up of semi-detached houses built in pairs			0
in 1920 there were eight million homes in @entity0 and within 15 years this had risen to 12 million			1
many of these properties were designed for modern life , with larger kitchens , dining rooms and bedrooms , as well as spacious gardens for children to play in			2
it also coincided with the growth in the great @entity0 cul - de - sac			2
the majority of these new homes were built along or close to the @entity0 's railway lines , making it possible for residents to commute to their nearest town or city centres for work and leisure activities			2
a typical semi in @entity27 cost £ 750 93 years ago and anyone who could afford one was considered a ' high - flyer '			1
local authorities could also ask developers to make homes more friendly for the elderly or wheelchair - bound with new ‘ access ’ requirements			0
@entity159 , the @entity160 , has attacked the way families are ‘ trapped in rabbit hutch homes ’			0
he blamed the move towards smaller homes on @entity167 policy , which decreed that at least 30 homes had to be built on every hectare of land			0
ministers see the tighter restrictions as pay back for helping the homebuilding sector to recover			0
government policies such as the controversial help to buy mortgage scheme are expected to fuel the building sector and they now want developers to give something back to communities			0
in return , ministers will reduce more than 1,500 pages of guidance to fewer than 80 , a move they claim will save builders time and money			0
mr @entity97 said : ‘ at a time when we are working closely with @entity0 business to create jobs and build a stronger economy it ’s essential the government plays its part by taking off the bureaucratic handbrake that holds back house building and adds unnecessary cost			1
i ’m proposing to cut needless red tape to let house builders get on with the real job of building the high quality new homes that people need , especially families and first time buyers			0
’ he added : ' the current mish - mash of housing standards means that from @entity209 in @entity210 to @entity211 in @entity212 no same set of rules always applies - it ’s confusing , bureaucratic and can not be allowed to continue			0
’ some of the standards facing abolition include requiring rainwater harvesting in places where there is no water shortage , demanding solar panels or windmills on homes where they can not physically fit , requirements to build accessible flats on floors that can not be reached by disabled people , and demanding bigger windows to allow for dirt on them rather than assuming homeowners will simply clean them to allow in more light			0

average homes 90 years ago usually measured 1,647 sq ft with 4 bedrooms
today ’s equivalent has only three bedrooms and is a mere 925 sq ft
experts say new homes cause poor *health* , *divorces* and hold back children
one - bedroom flat today is on average the same size as a @entity35 carriage
@entity0 also has the smallest houses when compared to the rest of @entity41
