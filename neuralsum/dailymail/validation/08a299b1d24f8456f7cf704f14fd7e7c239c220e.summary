a website which collects together pictures of @entity3 's most handsome male commuters has proved a huge hit in @entity5 - but it might not be quite for the intended reason			1
@entity8 is filled with pictures of the capital 's finest looking men on the @entity12 , uploaded by fellow commuters for others to rate and share			1
it has proved exceedingly popular since it was set up in 2011 , with almost 10,000 likes of @entity19 and 8,600 followers on @entity21			2
but it seems these figures drastically underestimate the actual popularity of the site , because they fail to take into account a massive audience in @entity5			0
according to @entity47 , comments include ' i want to take tubes everyday ! ' and ' handsome people really look good in anything '			0
some experts have suggested the popularity of the pictures is down to the impression given of all @entity44 men being well - groomed and well - mannered - a @entity5 cliche			1
however , it is not always the men 's arms , stubble or sharp suits which is making people share the images			0
it transpires some are more taken with the space available to commuters on @entity3 's @entity69			1
' you think we like the men ; we just like looking at men taking up so much space on the @entity69 , ' the @entity73 reported one commenter as saying			1
international appeal : the good - looking men of @entity3 are also creating waves on the otherside of the world thousands : one picture can get 100,000 shares - popularity boosted by the ' @entity87 ' effect room : but some have alleged it is more to do with the space on the @entity69 , rather than the dashing gentleman packed : the two cities driving most of the @entity5 traffic to @entity8 are @entity95 and @entity96 - which have the fourth and sixth busiest metro systems in the world , respectively			1
pictured : @entity100 metro ' look at where the traffic to this site comes from - it 's all from cities where our own underground systems are massively overcrowded			0
' @entity109 co-founder @entity108 , confirmed to the @entity47 that most of the @entity5 traffic was driven by people from @entity96 and @entity100			2
both cities metro systems are in the top ten busiest networks in the world			1
@entity115 had 2.28billion passengers in 2014 , putting it sixth in the list , while @entity100 's 2.824billion passengers meant it was the fourth busiest globally , according to @entity119			0
in comparison , @entity3 has just 1.265billion passengers last year			0
' i suppose @entity37 could be misinterpreted , ' @entity108 said			0
' perhaps people who are travelling on the underground system in @entity5 are thinking more about space [ than good looking men ]			2
' he joked : ' it 's probably driving the traffic			0

@entity109 collects photos of the @entity69 's best looking commuters
proved huge hit since it was launched in 2011 with thousands of followers
but biggest *market* is @entity5 , where one snap can be shared 100,000 times
but some suggest it is the space not the men making the pictures a hit
@entity5 is home to four out of ten of the busiest metro systems in the world
