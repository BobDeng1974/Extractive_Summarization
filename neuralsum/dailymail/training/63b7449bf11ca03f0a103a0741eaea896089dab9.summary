criminal connections : @entity1 , 17 , is accused of being an accessory to first degree murder in the @entity5 murder case but police knew him because his name kept coming up in other investigations one of the three ' bored ' teenagers held over the murder of @entity5 in a drive - by shooting was linked to a string of armed robberies allegedly committed with his pregnant girlfriend , @entity9 can reveal today			1
@entity1 , 17 , who was driving the car and brought in by cops repeatedly after a spate of raids , one of the investigating detectives said today			1
@entity9 can also reveal that @entity23 , 15 , who @entity1 allegedly said pulled the trigger , was known to have a ' very short ' temper and is ' incredibly violent '			1
detective @entity26 told @entity9 that investigators recognized @entity1 ' @entity28 from surveillance footage and that triggered their search for the killers of the @entity34 baseball player			1
while investigating three different armed robberies in march of this year , @entity26 said that the police ' kept seeing his vehicle , we got to know his vehicle '			1
' ( it was ) the @entity28 used in the drive - by shooting			0
the vehicle was known to us			0
that was one thing that helped identifying the vehicle used in the killing of mr @entity5 , ' he told @entity9			1
' i ’ve not known him to be claiming any gang ... i ’ve been watching @entity1 , in reference to some other crimes previously , in some armed robberies and with another gentlemen who ’s been doing some second - degree burglaries			1
’ there were three armed robberies in @entity56 within days of each other this past march , and that is when @entity1 ’ face and car became familiar to investigators			1
‘ whenever we executed a search warrant on a house where the armed robbers lived , he showed up when we were at the front door			0
they contacted him , because he showed up at a parking lot that was real close to the house , with his girlfriend — and she ’s pregnant with his child , ’ detective @entity26 said			2
connections : @entity1 ( seen right next to an unknown young woman ) and his pregnant girlfriend showed up at three searches relating to earlier armed robberies in the town and police began recognizing his car ‘ as we were compiling everything on the armed robberies and arresting those responsible , his name kept coming up			1
we pulled him in two maybe three times , interviewed him and his girlfriend too			0
’ the girlfriend has not been identified but she was in court briefly on tuesday before the hearing for @entity1 , @entity23 and @entity90			1
she was sitting near @entity1 ’ relatives and allegedly broke down in tears			2
she became so emotional that she left the room before @entity1 even entered			2
police knew @entity1 had ties to the individuals involved in the armed robberies , and apparently so did @entity90			1
one neighbor whose son was allegedly the group ’s next target claims that @entity1 , @entity90 and @entity23 perpetrated the seemingly random killing as part of a gang initiation - possibly the @entity105 since the infamous group has a growing presence in the town - but police say it is slightly less formal			1
‘ the close association with all of these people , the armed robberies , and the ones that committed the murder , are all associated , they are known to be contacted by law enforcement , ’ detective @entity26 said			1
suspects : @entity1 said that he was driving when either @entity90 ( left ) or @entity23 ( right ) pulled the trigger killing @entity120 heartbroken : @entity121 ( left ) has spoken out about her devastation following her boyfriend @entity5 's ( right ) murder during a drive by shooting on friday when he was jogging near her house ‘ i can not say this is a gang , no. they knew each other , they hung out			1
yes , by classification , to be called a gang , they have to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name , but at this point i ca n’t say they are a gang			0
‘ the armed robbers are in jail , all three are in jail , i have n’t known them to be in gangs , they had their own group			0
these are closely associated , intertwined , between the armed robbery and the murder - known associates , with known contacts with law enforcement			2
@entity90 would be with this person at a traffic stop , and they were known to hang out together			2
’ their full criminal histories have not been made public as they were treated as minors before the brutal killing			0
it also emerged today from court documents that security footage shows that after the shooting , the @entity28 was parked behind a hotel for a little over ten minutes , and @entity23 told investigators that the boys were smoking marijuana while they hid the murder weapon in the car 's interior			1
illegal : @entity23 told officers that the group smoked marijuana behind a hotel after the shooting the police report reveals that 17 - year - old @entity1 admitted he was driving the car			1
‘ he stated to @entity175 that @entity90 and @entity23 were in the car and that one of them had fired the gun and that he was not telling which had fired the gun but it was not him but it was either @entity23 or @entity90 , ’ the report reads			1
an hour after their initial interview , @entity1 said that he wanted to speak to investigators again and he inquired whether his father or a lawyer had gotten in touch			2
when the police officer said that he could not tell him that information , the teen said that ‘ he could not tell lt @entity193 who had shot the male because if he did he would get killed ’			0
the officer tried getting more information from @entity1 about the location of the gun - saying that he did n’t want it to get into the hands of a child - and @entity1 said that police would never find it because he gave it to someone else			2
‘ it is a .22 revolver and that is why you did not find any brass , ’ @entity1 said			0
he would not reveal that person ’s identity but said that individual had siblings in jail , which led police to believe that it was @entity216 , a person whose name had come up during the armed robberies			2
questionable ties : detectives said that while there are pictures of @entity23 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) throwing gang signs , they are not believed to be associated with any particular group , more like ' wannabes ' @entity1 said that while they were smoking marijuana , he took out the cold air induction in his car and hid the gun there , presumably for the other individual to take it			1
while @entity1 did not seem to change his story dramatically during his police interviews , the new report shows that @entity23 did tell two different versions of events - first saying that he was n’t in the car at the time of the shooting and then saying that he knew who fired the shot but only because he was told who did and not because he saw			1
tough image : police also said that @entity23 ( pictured ) , who posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening , was a big fan of a rapper who promotes violence that change of heart came after he met with his father in between two police interviews			2
it was also not his only unusual behavior inside the police department , as officers saw him dance while he was being checked into the facility			0
when @entity23 was standing behind a desk , he ‘ began to dance , he did some kind of dance motion , ’ detective @entity26 told @entity9			1
@entity262 , a 25 - year - old woman named @entity263 , who would not give her last name for fear of retribution , said that she has known @entity23 through her cousin and he was ' always around ' growing up			0
she said that he could be violent and would get in ' a lot of fights '			0
' a lot of it gang related			0
he would fight over nothing , ' @entity263 said			0
' gangs are always an iffy thing around here , and when you do n’t exactly have family to look up to - then for someone like that the gang can be the only family he has			0
' @entity23 ' father has been raising his son while his mother is in jail for an unspecified crime			0
@entity263 told of a recent incident where she ran into @entity23 near an apartment complex and either @entity23 or one of his friends was waving a gun around			2
' i told him to put it away , there are three or four children around and that is not acceptable at all and he put it in his pants and walked away , ' she told @entity9			2
besides fighting , @entity263 said that she knew he ' has sold marijuana in the past '			0
when asked if she was suprised by his alleged involvement in @entity5 's murder , she said : ' not so much that , but i did n’t think he was possible of taking it that far			2
' different instance : a friend told @entity9 how she recently saw @entity23 put a gun in his pants after she scolded he and his friends for waving it around when there were children nearby ( @entity23 seen here in a picture from his @entity310 account ) @entity23 , 15 , and @entity90 , 16 face first degree murder charges and will be tried as an adult but if found guilty , they still may not receive the death penalty even though it is allowed in @entity314			1
@entity1 faces a lesser charge of accessory to first - degree murder and using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon			1
duncan police chief @entity321 said that rather than being part of any gang , which had been suggested before , authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the thuggish beliefs of their idols , with @entity328 the most popular among them			0
today , @entity321 said : ' these boys were more into some rapper that goes around , his music is violent			0
one of the parents said something about rap			0
' these boys have no respect for life or authority or society , it does n't matter who it is			0
by one of their own words , they saw him go by , and they said , " there 's the target " and they followed him and shot him			0
he could have been anybody walking down the street			0
