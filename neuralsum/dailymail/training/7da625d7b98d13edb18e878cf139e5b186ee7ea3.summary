by @entity0 last updated at 3:43 pm on 3rd october 2011 a blind man was twice banned from buying goods in a sports store because his disability meant he was unable to use the chip and pin pad			1
@entity7 , who has been blind since he was 10 , has vowed to take action against retailer @entity9 after he was prevented from using his debit card to shop there			1
on two occasions the 44 - year - old factory worker asked to make his payment by giving his signature , as allowed by his bank			1
but he was refused and told he must enter his pin because of ' company policy '			2
refused : @entity7 , who is registered blind and can not use chip and pin was not allowed to sign for purchases in @entity9 in the @entity23 shopping centre , @entity24 mr @entity7 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , initially went to a branch in @entity24 to buy a t - shirt for £ 7			1
despite never experiencing any problems signing for his card before , staff refused to accept it and he was told to pay with cash instead			0
mr @entity7 complained to the company and got a letter of apology which assured him they would re-train their staff accordingly			1
but when he went back to buy a t - shirt and a vest for £ 12 , staff again refused to accept his signature - with the manager telling him they ' could n't accept ' his form of payment			2
mr @entity7 who is seeking damages from the company said : ' what they are doing is pure disability discrimination against the blind , ' i have an arrangement with my bank to give my signature on a debit card payment and i never have a problem anywhere else			1
' but these people said it was company policy that signatures were not allowed and they needed me to put in my pin number			2
' their attitude made me feel really stupid because there were loads of people behind me in the queue at the shop and they probably thought i do n't have any money in the bank			2
mr @entity7 who suffers from a genetic condition , said that he has never encountered problems with signing against a card payment before			1
he said : ' in my whole adult life this has never happened in any other shop , but it 's happened twice in @entity9 , ' the first time they would n't accept my card payment , this was in may of last year			0
it was the same thing , they said they could n't accept my signature			0
' @entity9 said they were going to address the matter and give the staff more training , and that it would n't happen again			0
' no change : despite receiving a letter of apology from @entity9 which said staff would receive extra training the incident happened again in a letter from @entity9 in september 2010 , a manager said : ' like all other @entity99 retailers we stopped generally accepting sign for cards over two years ago with the introduction of chip and pin			1
' we do understand however that there are always going to be some exceptions			0
' following your letter we have instigated further training in the store in respect to till procedures and i 'm sure when you return to the store they will be happy to assist			0
' however earlier this month mr @entity7 was again shopping for sports equipment in the @entity9 and was again refused his standard method of payment			1
when he asked to speak to a manager he was told it was company policy and was handed a customer complaints form @entity126 rehabilitation services manager at blind persons charity @entity128 said : ' the issue with a keypad is they are all slightly different because of that it means learning a hundred different keypads			0
' i would say @entity9 is definitely being discriminator			0
under the @entity135 it should look at ways of making things more accessible			0
' a spokesman for @entity139 said : ' @entity139 believes it is a reasonable adjustment under the @entity141 that stores allow their blind and partially sighted customers the option of using chip and signature			2
' @entity9 , who made a profit of £ 89.2m last year , were unavailable for comment .			0

@entity152 twice turned away @entity7 , 44 , when he tried to sign for his goods
he has *permission* from his bank to use signature rather than chip and pin
