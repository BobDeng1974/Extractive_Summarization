by @entity0 the @entity1 is not right : @entity2 could lose the $ 7.7million that she won last year after claiming she was discriminated over her pregnancy a former model for @entity6 could lose the $ 7.7million that she won last year after claiming she was discriminated over her 2008 pregnancy , and wrongfully terminated			1
@entity2 , 42 , who appeared on the show for seven years , was awarded the multi-million - dollar sum in punitive damages last november following a high - profile legal battle with @entity13 and producers @entity14			1
but now the case is going back to trial after a @entity19 judge decreed yesterday that there were ' bad jury instructions '			1
according to @entity24 , the judge in last year 's trial failed to tell the jury that the discrimination in question had to be a " substantial " motivation factor , despite a request to do so from the defendants			1
the news comes just a week after the @entity33 @entity32 issued a new ruling that discrimination must be a substantial motivating factor in mixed motive cases			0
judge @entity38 wrote in yesterday 's ruling : ' the instruction error can not be considered harmless			2
of central importance to the case was the weight given to discriminatory intent and whether that intent need only be of a mere motivating factor or a substantial factor			2
' given this central dispute , the failure to give the proper instruction regarding substantial factor can not be considered harmless , and a new trial must be granted			0
' ms @entity2 appeared on @entity13 for seven years using her maiden name , @entity54 , alongside former host @entity55 and current host @entity56			1
in the trial last year , ms @entity2 claimed she got pregnant in 2007 but could n’t tell anyone at work as she was so scared of losing her job and , due to the severe stress , ‘ that pregnancy ended in a miscarriage ’			1
according to @entity66 , one producer even told ms @entity2 that losing this pregnancy was ‘ nature 's way of getting rid of a bad baby			1
’ professional posing : ms @entity2 , pictured with fellow models @entity73 ( center ) and @entity75 ( right ) in 2008 , appeared on @entity13 for seven years when she got pregnant again , with twins , in late 2008 , it is claimed that producers subjected her to cruel insults			1
when she walked past the one producer he allegedly scoffed : ' wide load coming through			0
' ms @entity2 claims that she was rejected by producers when she sought to return to the show in early 2010			1
' they ignored me , for probably about four months , trying to get a direct response about working , ' she told @entity87			0
since the verdict was announced last november , @entity14 has launched an appeal			0
it said in a statement to @entity87 : ' we believe the verdict in this case was the result of a flawed process in which the court , among other things , refused to allow the jury to hear and consider that 40per cent of our models have been pregnant and other important evidence to our defense			2
' we expect to be fully vindicated after the matter has been reviewed			0
' all smiles : ms @entity2 ( far right ) , who is professionally known by her maiden name , @entity54 , pictured with former @entity6 host @entity55 in 2003 last month , a @entity1 is right model appeared on air with a huge baby bump in a pre-recorded celebrity special featuring @entity110			2
@entity75 , 30 , who is married to @entity112 player @entity111 , was seen assisting on a game with a heavily - pregnant stomach			0
she was likely very close to her due date , because she welcomed a baby girl named @entity117 on february 13			0
perhaps anticipating a verdict in last year 's legal proceedings , @entity6 also made a show of announcing ms @entity75 ' pregnancy last september			2
in the first episode of season 41 , she presents a prize of an @entity125 bearing images of her sonogram on the screen			0
host @entity56 is the first to congratulate her as co-workers , another of whom is visibly pregnant , gather round to offer their warm wishes .			0

@entity2 , 42 , who appeared on the show for seven years , claimed she was discriminated over her 2008 pregnancy , and wrongfully terminated
now a @entity19 judge has decreed that there were ' bad jury instructions ' and that the case must return to trial
